      "subtitle": "Documentary filmmaker and left-wing activist Michael Moore claimed without evidence that President Donald Trump is lying about his health, suggesting that the president\u2019s recent visit to Walter Reed hospital wasn\u2019t for a routine check-up as stated by White House officials.",
      "author": "David Ng",
      "content": " Michael Moore made his claims shortly before President Trump appeared at a cabinet meeting Tuesday at the White House, where the commander in chief called members of the press \u201csick\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d for implying that he had suffered a heart attack. White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement Sunday that\u00a0President Trump took advantage of a free weekend to begin portions of his routine annual physical exam at Walter Reed. Grisham also appeared on Fox News over the weekend and told Judge Jeanine Pirro that President Trump\u2019s visit to Walter Reed was \u201croutine\u201d and that the president was \u201cdoing just fine.\u201d The Bowling for Columbine director expressed his incredulity early Tuesday morning, saying on Twitter that no one in the White House press corps had seen President Trump since Saturday when the commander in chief made an unannounced visit to the Washington, D.C. hospital. Moore also accused the White House of lying about President Trump\u2019s health.  At Tuesday\u2019s cabinet meeting, President Trump said he went to Walter Reed for\u00a0a \u201cvery routine physical\u201d and visited a few members of the military who were being treated there. President Trump then blasted the mainstream news media, including CNN, for speculating if he had experienced massive chest pains. \u201cWe don\u2019t have freedom of the press in this country, we have the opposite, we have a very corrupt media and I hope they can get their act straightened out because it\u2019s very, very bad and very dangerous to this country,\u201d Trump said. President Trump\u2019s\u00a0military physician issued a statement Monday denying the rumors being spread by some news outlets. \u201cDespite some of the speculation, the President has not had any chest pain, nor was he evaluated or treated for any urgent or acute issues,\u201d Physician to the President Navy Cdr. Sean Conley wrote in a letter. With reporting by Charlie Spiering. Follow David Ng on Twitter\u00a0@HeyItsDavidNg. Have a tip? Contact me at\u00a0dng@breitbart.com",

      "content": " \u201cThe Republicans are absolutely killing it; they are doing so well because they are doing so well,\u201d Trump said proudly during a cabinet meeting at the White House on Tuesday afternoon. Ranking Member Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA) began Tuesday\u2019s hearing by torching Democrats and their \u201cpuppets\u201d in the media for their one-sided approach to the impeachment process, as hearings began with Lt.\u00a0Col. Alexander Vindman and Jennifer Williams, an adviser to Vice President Mike Pence. Trump commented that Vindman insisted during the hearing that he be addressed by Republicans by his military rank and questioned why Vindman was suddenly wearing his military uniform at the impeachment hearings when he wears civilian clothes at the White House. He said he would let the public decide for themselves whether Vindman was credible but said that he did not even know who he was. \u201cI don\u2019t know Vindman; I\u2019ve never heard of him,\u201d he said. Trump also noted that Vindman testified that the transcript released of his July 25 call with Ukrainian President\u00a0Volodymyr Zelensky was accurate.\n\nHe also referenced State Department official George Kent, who testified on Tuesday, \u201cwith a nice bow tie, the wonderful bow tie.\u201d \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll get one for myself one day,\u201d Trump mused. He denied knowing any of the bureaucrats testifying, including Kent, Vindman, and Acting United States Ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor. \u201cAll of these people are talking about they heard a conversation of a conversation of another conversation, that was had by the president,\u201d he said. Trump described the proceedings as a \u201ckangaroo court\u201d led by \u201cLittle Shifty Schiff,\u201d criticizing the Democrats for not allowing White House lawyers to cross-examine the witnesses. He said that the founders would have never thought the current Democrat-led impeachment hoax would be possible, under the Constitution. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on is a disgrace, and its an embarrassment to our nation,\u201d he said.",

      "content": " Congressional investigators are hearing testimony from Kurt Volker, the former U.S. Special Representative for Ukraine, and Tim Morrison, who briefly served as the National Security Council\u2019s top official for Europe and Russia. Volker\u00a0gave a closed-door deposition before the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs, and Oversight committees on October 3, testifying that\u00a0President Trump did not want Ukraine to \u201cdig up dirt\u201d on former Vice President and current presidential candidate Joe Biden, nor did he ever reference the 2020 election to him. \u201cI was never asked to do anything that I thought was wrong\u201d by President Trump, he told lawmakers. On October 31,\u00a0Morrison testified privately that\u00a0he believed nothing improper took place during President Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Nonetheless, a CIA analyst\u2019s\u00a0mischaracterization of the call formed the basis of a \u201cwhistleblower\u201d complaint, sparking the House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry. Earlier Tuesday,\u00a0Lt. Col. Alexander\u00a0Vindman, a National Security Council official, and Jennifer Williams,\u00a0a Russia adviser for Vice President Mike\u00a0Pence, testified publically before the House intel panel.

Adam Schiff (D-CA) made it clear that the Democrats on the committee he chairs will decide what crime Trump allegedly committed. \u201cJust wanted to make one point clear for folks that are watching the hearing today,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cBribery does involve a quid pro quo.\u201d \u201cBribery involves the conditioning of an official act for something of value,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cAn official act may be a White House meeting.\u201d \u201cAn official act may be $400 million in military aid, and something of value to a president might include investigations of their political rival,\u201d Schiff said, adding that America\u2019s founders included bribery in its list of high crimes and misdemeanors. \u201cIt will be our job to decide whether the impeachable act of bribery has occurred,\u201d Schiff said.

The RNC has also had to buy more copies of the book to keep up with public demand, too, an RNC official said. Since the money raised figure is a net gain, that means the party raised $500,000 plus off the signed books after covering the costs of buying the books. \u201cThe media would have you believe we stocked a warehouse with copies of this book, but that couldn\u2019t be further from the truth,\u201d RNC spokesman Steve Guest told Breitbart News. \u201cDon\u2019s book has been a fundraising home run for the party, and the overwhelming demand means we have even more resources heading into 2020.\u201d Trump, Jr., hit number one on the New York Times bestseller list with the release of Triggered, and has been on a whirlwind book tour across the country selling copies of it and triggering establishment media figures like the hosts of The View during a particularly memorable appearance on that show. \u201cYou could erase every book sold to supporters through the RNC and Don still would have sold double the amount of books as the second place finisher on the New York Times bestsellers list,\u201d a source close to Trump, Jr., added in a comment to Breitbart News. The RNC has been giving out signed copies of the book to anyone who makes donations of at least $50 via a special website through the party\u2019s online fundraising platform. While the RNC did not provide the exact number of Trump, Jr., books that have been sold through this service, given that the minimum donation to get one is $50, that means it could be as many as 10,000 copies, as the RNC raised more than half a million so far.",

China wants those tariffs removed as part of the preliminary deal and said in October that a tariff rollback would be part of the deal. President Trump last week said he had not agreed to rollback tariffs. China hawks in the White House want to keep existing tariffs in place while a comprehensive deal is worked out.

NPR reported on its poll and the impeachment inquiry, which was officially launched after a \u201cwhistleblower\u201d came forward to sound alarms about Trump allegedly pressuring the newly elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden and his dealings with a Ukrainian oil company: Some 70 percent of registered voters say they\u2019ve been paying \u201cvery\u201d or \u201cfairly\u201d close attention to the House impeachment inquiry.

Of course, 54 percent of voters did not vote for Trump in the 2016 presidential election, either.

      "author": "Edwin Mora",
      "content": " Volker\u2019s testimony once again undermined the quid pro quo claim contained in a \u201cwhistleblower\u2019s\u201d complaint that triggered the impeachment inquiry launched by House Democrats. GOP lawmakers have said Volker\u2019s October 3 deposition obliterated \u00a0the accusation against Trump at the center of the impeachment investigation and\u00a0\u201cexonerated\u201d him. Volker\u2019s October 3 deposition is consistent with his public testimony on Tuesday. The \u201cwhistleblower\u201d complaint accused Trump of abusing his power by leveraging U.S. aid during a July 25 call to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to launch an investigation into corruption allegations against the Bidens. Echoing his October 3 secret deposition almost verbatim on Tuesday, Volker testified alongside\u00a0former top European affairs official on Trump\u2019s National Security Council (NSC) Tim Morrison, the only two witnesses sought by the Republican minority and accepted by Democrats. At no time was I aware of or knowingly took part in an effort to urge Ukraine to investigate former Vice president Biden. As you know, from the extensive real-time documentation I have provided, Vice President Biden was not a topic of our discussions. I was not on the July 25 phone call between President Trump and President Zelensky. I was not made aware of any reference to Vice President Biden or his son by President Trump until the transcript of that call was released [by the White House] on September [24]. Volker provided \u201creal-time\u201d evidence in the forms of texts between U.S. State Department officials and Trump\u2019s private lawyer Rudy Giuliani. Characterizations by Democrats and impeachment witnesses, namely White House National Security (NSC) Director of European Affairs Lt. Col. Alexander\u00a0Vindman, allege that Trump \u201cdemanded\u201d that Ukraine investigate the Bidens. An unofficial transcript of the call released by the White House on September 24 shows that Trump urged Ukraine to carry out the investigation, without threatening to withhold aid if the country did not play ball. Volker and other current and former officials who testified, including U.S. diplomat Bill Taylor, deemed a \u201cstar witness\u201d by Democrats, acknowledged Ukraine did not even know the U.S. had frozen aid during the July 25 call, prompting Republicans to argue that a quid pro quo offer during the conversation would have been impossible at the time. You can\u2019t leverage an unknown to get something you want, which in this case would have been the investigations into the Bidens. \u201cI don\u2019t think\u201d Ukraine was \u201caware\u201d that U.S. aid was being withheld \u201cat the time\u201d of the call, \u201cso there was no leverage implied,\u201d Volker proclaimed during his October 3 deposition. The Trump administration ended up releasing the aid on September 11 without Ukraine having to launch investigations into the Bidens or possible interference in the 2016 U.S. elections or even participating in a meeting. Despite allegations to the contrary, Zelensky testified Tuesday that the Trump-Zelensky meeting was \u201cnot conditioned\u201d on Ukraine carrying out the so-called investigation into White House hopeful and Trump\u2019s political rival Biden. Trump, Zelensky, Volker, and other impeachment probe witnesses denied the existence of the quid pro quo allegations contained in the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d complaint and alleged by some impeachment witnesses, citing hearsay. On October 3, Volker explicitly denied that he \u201cdidn\u2019t think\u201d there was a quid pro quo during the July 25 call. Volker did not participate in the call and did not even know when it was going to take place. Democrats and their mainstream media allies attempted to paint Volker as a significant player in helping Trump push for so-called political investigations in return for aid, although he denied any involvement. On Tuesday, Volker made it clear that, unlike him, some of his colleagues did not see a distinction between an investigation into the Ukrainian company that hired Hunter Biden from 2014 to April of this year and the Bidens. Some U.S. officials and Democrats conflated the two, a move that benefited their impeachment agenda. Volker defended former VP Biden against corruption allegations, saying he is an honorable man. His defense of Biden on Tuesday and October 3 suggested he was not pushing for any investigation of the Bidens. The Democrat-led House Committees on Oversight and Reform, Intelligence, and Foreign Affairs are leading the impeachment inquiry. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA), the chief impeachment inquisitor, is hosting the public hearings, of which more are expected this week.",

It\u2019s ominously akin to a present day Salem Witch Trial with the suppressed minority victimized just as much as the target, where due process in nothing more than an abstract concept.\u00a0 We see it. We know it. And we can turn it off. Walk away. Christmas shop. And think about it later. Not so for this President.\u00a0 He does not have that luxury. It is his life. The life of his family.\u00a0 It has become his reality. And the latest assault of the Resistance can\u2019t help but impede his effectiveness to govern. And that is the point. From the day he took office, everything that led up to this moment would have crippled a lesser man. I often think about his family. His youngest son. His grandchildren. He left a successful and dare I say fulfilling life of comfort by any measurable standard to take on this thankless job. He left the helm of an empire that surely needed him, and he did so without a backward glance. I\u2019ve never wondered why. I believe it was and is a deep seated patriotism and love of country. He is giving back to a country that afforded him such financial success and was willing to put it all on the line to fix what he saw as broken. Unlike so many others, his run for the highest office in the land was not then, nor will it ever be, motivated by self-enrichment. That much should be clear. He has upset the well-oiled components of those who make up the swamp, the murky business of Washington as a whole, and that is his unpardonable sin. Hillary Clinton had it half right when she claimed they were \u201cdead broke\u201d when they left office.\u00a0 She just accidentally on purpose mixed up the timeframe. In actuality. they were dead broke when they arrived at the White House in 1993.\u00a0 They began fleecing the public upon arrival and never stopped dipping their hands in the till. They left multimillionaires, spent the ensuing years diligently padding their coffers, and never looked back.\u00a0 The Obamas did rather well, too, arriving with little, multimillionaires today. Their presidencies resulted in riches behind their wildest dreams. Think about that. Then there is President trump. Does anyone ever wonder how he does it?\u00a0 How despite the relentless attacks ranging from the ridiculous to the sublime, the President gets up every morning and gives his all, and has since day one, very close to three years ago? There is just so much a person can take. House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) speaks during a hearing with witness U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch before the House Intelligence Committee in the Longworth House Office Building on Capitol Hill. (Joshua Roberts \u2013 Pool/Getty Images) But Donald Trump is not your average person.\u00a0 Without ever missing a beat, and under the most extraordinary and unprecedented circumstances to ever face a peacetime president, he works for us.\u00a0 And what a job he\u2019s done. It\u2019s more remarkable that he has achieved such across the board success, considering he has had both hands tied behind his back.\u00a0 It is left for us to imagine what he could have accomplished with just a little bipartisan support, a little less sabotage, on Capitol Hill. That he has to fail so the resistors can win is a loss to us all. The onslaught of media and partisan hatred has never ceased.\u00a0 It has been relentless. Yet, he has been able to compartmentalize, to reduce to so much white noise everything from the Russian Collusion Hoax to the daily debacle that followed as he boldly forged forward. But make no mistake. President Trump is not a peacetime president.\u00a0 He is, for all intents and purposes, a President under siege.\u00a0 A defacto wartime President, he is the sole enemy of a significant portion of the elected and non-elected government officials of his own country. With the eager complicity of what used to be called the mainstream media, they have controlled the dialogue since Inauguration Day.\u00a0 They have had one goal. They want him out at all costs. Their quest is seen as righteous, his presidency illegitimate. In their arrogance, they\u2019ve forgotten who gets to make that determination. The impeachment proceedings have been in the works since the day this man committed the unforgiveable crime of first being elected and then being sworn into office.\u00a0 For that, he had to be punished. Tarring and feathering is no longer in vogue. Local Gulags unavailable. Impeachment became the next best thing, Having worked for two Presidents in the rarified air of the Oval Office corridor, I know first-hand the relentless pressure faced by a sitting President. It\u2019s not for the faint of heart. But this? It makes the experience of his predecessors look like child\u2019s play. Because each had the luxury, more or less, of a status quo in Washington that allowed them to govern. Not so for this President. Not for one single minute. In the face of his intestinal fortitude, the likes of which I have personally never seen, I\u2019ve begun to think of him as someone with special powers. Because who else could survive all this?\u00a0 Anyone else would have been flattened by now. In his seeming capacity for unending valor in the face of nonstop virulent attacks, he reminds me of a figure from my long-ago childhood. A latter-day man of steel, the original caped Superman taking on the demons of Metropolis, even in the face of the deadly Kryptonite. It\u2019s not such a stretch, at least metaphorically. Of course, he is a mere mortal. The super powers all an illusion. All except one. An important one. One he should never forget. It is the dogged commitment of his millions upon millions of supporters across our great country, a number growing exponentially as even Democrats recognize the sabotage as this farce marches on, as we watch Trump Derangement Syndrome overtake our government. We are his strength. And in the end, his one real super power. As this farce fumbles on, my money is on President Trump.\u00a0 The kryptonite that is the Capitol Hill cabal does not understand with whom they are dealing when it comes to this President and worse, they are clueless when it comes to the electorate. They trivialized both before, they are doing so again. So, they proceed at their own peril. And they don\u2019t stand a chance.",

According to U.S. diplomat\u00a0David Holmes, he overheard a July 26 call in which President Trump mentioned \u201cthe investigations\u201d to Sondland \u2014 an alleged reference to the president\u2019s request for Ukraine to probe into allegations of corruption against former Vice President and 2020 White House contender Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden.\u00a0Holmes testified that Sondland conveyed to him that President Trump cared \u201cmore about the investigations\u201d than Ukraine. A partisan CIA analyst mischaracterized the Trump-Zelensky call in a \u201cwhistleblower\u201d complaint to the intelligence community inspector general, prompting the House Democrats to launch an impeachment probe on September 24.

Lee Zeldin (R-NY) and other Republicans are driving this point home:\u00a0Sondland assumed President Trump made U.S. aide to Ukraine\u00a0contingent on probes into the Bidens.  11:35 A.M.\u00a0\u2014  11:28 A.M.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s office denies discussing investigations into the Bidens with Sondland: \u201cThe Vice President never had a conversation with Gordon Sondland about investigating the Bidens, Burisma, or the conditional release of financial aid to Ukraine based upon potential investigations. Ambassador Gordon Sondland was never alone with Vice President Pence on the September 1 trip to Poland.\u00a0This alleged discussion recalled by Ambassador Sondland never happened. Multiple witnesses have testified under oath that Vice President Pence never raised Hunter Biden, former Vice President Joe Biden, Crowdstrike, Burisma, or investigations in any conversation with Ukrainians or President Zelensky before, during, or after the September 1 meeting in Poland.\u201d 11:25 A.M.\u00a0\u2014 Sondland: \u201cI don\u2019t know about any drug deal.\u201d Nunes: \u201cAnd did you know you\u2019re part of the three amigos?\u201d Sondland: \u201cI am. I am a proud part of the three amigos.\u201d 11:21 A.M.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Nunes begins his questioning by asking Sondland whether he was aware of the efforts of DNC contractor Alexandra Chalupa and Ukraine\u2019s efforts to meddle in the 2016 election.\u00a0Sondland responds that he\u2019s unaware. 11:2o A.M.\u00a0\u2014 The hearing has resumed. 11:13 A.M.\u00a0\u2014 Schiff says at a press conference during the recess: \u201cToday\u2019s testimony is among the most significant evidence to date and what we have just heard from Sondland is. This scheme was a basic quid pro quo. It was the conditioning of official acts for something of great value, right to the heart of the issue of bribery.\u201d 11:07 A.M.\u00a0\u2014  11:04 A.M.\u00a0\u2014 The hearing is now in a brief recess. 11:03 A.M.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Sondland says he assumed that U.S. aid to Ukraine was\u00a0contingent on probes into the Bidens. Again,\u00a0Sondland previously stated President Trump never told him such a thing.  10:54 A.M.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Sondland:\u00a0\u201cPresident Trump never told me directly that the aid was conditioned on\u201d an announcement of a probe into the Bidens.  10:52 A.M.\u00a0\u2014 Important flashback:\u00a0Ukrainian foreign minister\u00a0Vadym Prystaiko said Sondland \u201cnever\u201d linked U.S. aid to investigations.  10:51 A.M.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Sondland:\u00a0\u201cI never heard anyone advocating for holding the aid.\u201d 10:49 A.M.\u00a0\u2014  10:44 A.M.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Sondland on his relationship with President Trump: \u201cI had occasional access when he chose to take my calls. Sometimes he would, sometimes he wouldn\u2019t.\u201d 10:43 A.M.\u00a0\u2014  10:39 A.M.\u00a0\u2014  10:34 A.M.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0\u00a0Sondland says a change in his impeachment testimony was triggered by reference to rapper A$AP Rocky. 10:33 A.M.\u00a0\u2014  10:26 A.M.\u00a0\u2014  10:25 A.M.\u00a0\u2014  10:24 A.M.\u00a0\u2014 Sen.

And at all times, our efforts were in good faith and fully transparent to those tasked with overseeing them. Our efforts were reported and approved.\u201d 10:15 A.M.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Sondland wraps up his opening statement, saying he acted in\u00a0\u201cgood faith.\u201d \u201cAt all times, our efforts were in good faith and fully transparent to those tasked with overseeing them. Our efforts were reported and approved. Not once do I recall encountering objection,\u201d he adds. 10:13 A.M.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Sondland:\u00a0\u201cState Department was fully supportive of our engagement in Ukraine affairs, and was aware that a commitment to investigations was among the issues we were pursuing.\u201d 10:11 A.M.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Sondland:\u00a0\u201cBy the end of August, my belief was that if Ukraine did something to demonstrate a serious intention to fight corruption, specifically addressing Burisma and 2016 server, then the hold on military aid would be lifted.\u201d 10:08 A.M.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Sondland: \u201cIn preparation for the September 1 Warsaw meeting, I asked Secretary Pompeo whether a face-to-face conversation between President Trump with Zelensky could help break the logjam.\u201d \u201cSecretary Pompeo replied, \u2018Yes,'\u201d he adds. 10:05 A.M.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0\u00a0Sondland on the freeze on U.S. military aid to Ukraine: \u201cI was never able to obtain a clear answer regarding the specific reason for the hold.\u201d 10:03 A.M.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0\u00a0Sondland: \u201cWas there a \u2018quid pro quo?\u2019 As I testified previously, with regard to the requested White House call and White House meeting, the answer is yes.\u201d Sondland\u2019s testimony contradicts previous impeachment witnesses, including former U.S. envoy for Ukraine Kurt\u00a0Volker and former NSC official Tim Morrison,\u00a0who agreed that no quid pro quo, bribery, or treason occurred.  10:01 A.M.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0\u00a0Sondland confirms the July 26 call between Trump-Zelensky, which David Holmes testified that he overheard: \u201cThe White House, which has finally shared certain call dates and times with my attorneys, confirms this. The call lasted five minutes.\u201d \u201cAgain, given Mr. Giuliani\u2019s demand that President Zelensky make a public statement about investigations, I knew that the topic of investigations was important to President Trump. We did not discuss any classified information,\u201d he adds. 9:59 A.M.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Sondland: \u201cMr. Giuliani was communicating with the reportedly corrupt Ukrainian prosecutor Lutsenko and discussing whether a Zelensky-Trump meeting was going to happen, again without our knowledge.\u201d 9:57 A.M.\u00a0\u2014 Another important point from Biggs:  9:56 A.M.\u00a0\u2014  9:55 A.M.\u00a0\u2014  9:52 A.M.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Sondland\u00a0on Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and former National Security Advisor John Bolton: \u201cThey knew what we were doing and why.\u201d 9:50 A.M.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Sondland: \u201cLet me say again: We weren\u2019t happy with the President\u2019s directive to talk with Rudy. We did not want to involve Mr. Giuliani.\u201d 9:48 A.M.\u00a0\u2014 Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) rips Sondland\u2019s opening statement:  9:47 A.M.\u00a0\u2014 Rep. Andy Biggs (R-AZ) makes an important point about Sondland\u2019s testimony:  9:46 A.M.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Sondland:\u00a0\u201cIndeed, my personal view, which I shared repeatedly with others, was that the White House meeting and security assistance should have proceeded without pre-conditions of any kind.\u201d 9:45 A.M.\u00a0\u2014  9:44 A.M.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Sondland: \u201cIn the absence of any credible explanation for the suspension of aid, I later came to believe that the resumption of security aid would not occur until there was a public statement from Ukraine committing to the investigations of the 2016 election and Burisma.\u201d 9:43 A.M.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Sondland:\u00a0\u201cMr. Giuliani\u2019s requests were a quid pro quo for arranging a White House visit for President Zelensky. Mr. Giuliani was expressing the desires of the President of the United States, and we knew that these investigations were important to the President.\u201d 9:42 A.M.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Sondland:\u00a0\u201cPrecisely because we did not think that we were engaging in improper behavior, we made every effort to ensure that the relevant decisionmakers at the National Security Council and State Department knew the important details of our efforts.\u201d 9:41 A.M.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Sondland: \u201cWe did not want to work with Mr. Giuliani. We simply played the hand we were dealt.\u201d  9:38 A.M.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0\u00a0Sondland says the\u00a0State Department would not provide documents that could refresh his testimony:\u00a0\u201cHaving access to the State Department materials would have been very helpful to me in trying to reconstruct with whom I spoke and met, when, and what was said.\u00a0I am not a note-taker. I am not a memo writer. Never have been.\u201d He adds: \u201cThese documents are not classified and, in fairness, should have been made available. In the absence of these materials, my memory, admittedly has not been perfect.\u201d 9:36 A.M.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0\u00a0Sondland:\u00a0\u201cI expect that few Americans have heard my name before these events. My parents fled Europe during the Holocaust.\u201d 9:34 A.M.\u00a0\u2014 Sondland is being sworn in.  9:30 A.M.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0\u00a0Nunes:\u00a0\u201cWe need to subpoena Hunter Biden, as well as the whistleblower.\u201d 9:29 A.M.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0\u00a0Nunes: \u201cOur first president, George Washington, directed his own diplomatic channels to secure a treaty with Great Britain.

Sondland, the most anticipated witness in the inquiry, also said he kept Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and other top administration officials aware of what was going on. He said he specifically told Vice President Mike Pence he \u201chad concerns\u201d the military aid to Ukraine \u201chad become tied\u201d to the investigations. \u201cEveryone was in the loop,\u201d Sondland testified in opening remarks. \u201cIt was no secret.\u201d 8:46 A.M.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Sondland is arriving on Capitol Hill for his testimony.

He\u2019s going to be history at one point, though he\u2019d love to be president for life. He jokes about it,\u201d Robert De Niro said in an interview with the Daily beast. \u201cI think that if he became president for a second term he\u2019d try to have a third term, and let smarter people manipulate it into getting us into some kind of altercation: a war.\u201d \u201cThe only other president who served a third term was Roosevelt because he was in a war, and this fool would go and start something.

I never thought he\u2019d go for a third term if there was a war or something,\u2019\u201d De Niro continued. What the Taxi Driver\u00a0star didn\u2019t mention is that Franklin Delano Roosevelt\u00a0was already president when America joined the Allied forces in World War II, which was catalyzed by Japan attacking Pearl Harbor. Robert De Niro also failed to mention that shortly after Roosevelt\u2019s death in 1945, Congress began constructing what eventually became the 22nd Amendment, limiting presidents to two terms. Roosevelt died shortly after winning a fourth term in office.\u00a0Since its addition to U.S. Constitution in 1951, no U.S. president has ever served more than two full terms in office.

Nonetheless, former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report did not deliver desired results to impeachment-hungry Democrats, ultimately concluding no evidence of collusion or conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia. \u201cDenouncing the report as a whitewash and accusing Republicans of \u2018subverting\u2019 the investigation, the Democrats issued their own report focusing on their now-debunked conspiracy theory that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to hack the elections,\u201d Nunes said.

      "author": "Edwin Mora",
      "content": " Nunes, the top ranking Republican on the House intel panel, accused Democrats of waging a \u201cscorched earth political warfare on the other party\u201d during his opening remarks, adding: The Democrats have exploited the intelligence committee for political purposes for three years culminating in these impeachment herrings and their mania to attack the president. No conspiracy theory is too outlandish for the Democrats. \u2026 Clearly, these ludicrous accusations don\u2019t reflect committee members who are honestly searching for the truth. They\u2019re the actions of partisan extremists who hijacked the intelligence committee, transformed it into the impeachment committee, abandoned its oversight functions, and turned it into a beachhead for ousting an elected president from office. His comments came during the public hearing during which U.S. ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland is expected to testify. There has been friction between Trump and the intelligence community since the Russia collusion hoax began, prompting allegations that there could be plenty of \u201cdeep state\u201d agents within the intel agencies. The allegedly partisan \u201cwhistleblower\u201d who sparked the impeachment inquiry hailed from the intelligence community. Nunes proclaimed during the hearing: The Democrats have zeroed in on an anonymous whistleblower complaint that was cooked up in cooperation with the Democrats on this very committee. They lied to the American people about that cooperation and refused to let us question the whistleblower and discover the truth. Meanwhile, the Democrats lash out to anyone who questions or lashes out on this [impeachment] spectacle. When Ukrainian President [Volodymyr] Zelensky denies that anything wrong happened on that [July 25] phone call, the Democrats call him a liar. When journalists report Ukraine election meddling and [former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son] Hunter Biden\u2019s position on the board of corrupt Ukrainian companies, the Democrats label them conspiracy theorists. When the Democrats can\u2019t get any traction for their allegations of quid pro quo, they move the goal post and accuse the president of extortion, the bribery, and at last resort obstruction of justice. During their public hearing on Tuesday, former National Security Council (NSC) Russia expert Tim Morrison and former U.S. Special Envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker denied that any extortion or bribery had taken place during Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine. The \u201cwhistleblower\u201d complaint that triggered the impeachment probe accuses Trump of abusing his power by pressuring Zelensky during a July 25 call to investigate corruption allegations against Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Trump, Zelensky, Volker, and other impeachment inquiry witnesses have denied the allegations. Other witnesses, however, have presumed that a quid pro quo did take place during the July 25 call. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA), the lead impeachment inquisitor, lied about meeting with the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d before he filed the complaint, a move that has raised concerns of coordination. Some news outlets have described the leaker as an anti-Trump partisan. The \u201cwhistleblower\u201d may have broken the law by meeting with Schiff and/or his staff. Some impeachment probe witnesses have said there are merits to corruption allegations linked to Hunter Biden, suggesting that Trump was right to ask for an investigation from Ukraine. Combating corruption in Ukraine is a significant component of U.S. policy. Hunter worked for allegedly corrupt Ukrainian company Burisma from 2014 to April of this year. At the time that Burisma hired him, former VP Biden was spearheading U.S. policy towards Ukraine. Biden pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor who had investigated the Burisma owner, prompting accusations of corruption. The Obama administration knew Burisma and its owner were corrupt but allowed Hunter to work there anyway.",

I was not on the call. In fact, I first read the transcript on September 25, the same day it was publicly released,\u201d Sondland said during his opening statement. \u201cAll I had heard at the time was that the call had gone well,\u201d he continued.\u00a0\u201cLooking back, I find it very odd that neither I nor Ambassador Taylor nor Ambassador Volker ever received a detailed read-out of that call with the Biden references.\u201d \u201cNow, there are people who say they had concerns about that call. No one shared any concerns about the call with me at the time, when it would have been very helpful to know,\u201d Sondland added:   Sondland repeatedly stated that President Trump never told him directly that security aid was contingent on an investigation into the Bidens:      Sondland\u2019s claim that Trump never told him aid was conditioned on an investigation into the Bidens coincides with the testimony former diplomat Kurt Volker offered on Tuesday: \u201cDid the President of the United States ever say to you that he was not going to allow aid from the United States to go to the Ukraine unless there were investigations into Burisma, the Bidens, or the 2016 elections?\u201d Rep. Mike Turner (R-OH) asked Volker. \u201cNo, he did not,\u201d Volker said. Turner continued: Did the Ukrainians ever tell you that they understood that they would not get a meeting with the President of the United States, a phone call with the President of the United States, military aid, or foreign aid from the United States unless they undertook investigations of Burisma, the Bidens, or the 2016 elections? \u201cNo, they did not,\u201d Volker said. \u201cPretty much, Ambassador Volker, you just, like, took apart their entire case,\u201d Turner said.",

      "author": "John Nolte",
      "content": " Someone named Manfred Nowak, who heads something called the U.N. Global Study on Children Deprived of Liberty, told a bunch of corrupt reporters, \u201cWe have more than \u2014 still more than \u2014 100,000 children in migration-related detention in the United States of America.\u201d Among others, the Associated Press (and by extension all those who republished the AP), the AFP and Reuters, ran with it. Obviously, on its face, the story is an outrageous and absurd act of fake news. But when it comes to smearing the Trump administration \u2014 be it the Russia Collusion Hoax or this stupid impeachment process \u2014 evidence, facts, and common sense no longer matter. If it makes Trump look bad, the media simply play stenographer \u2014 be it for the Deep State, a bunch of witnesses who witnessed nothing, or this dishonest lame-brain working for the corrupt United Nations. Here\u2019s the real news [emphasis added throughout]: But on Tuesday, [Nowak] told The AP that [100,000] figure was drawn from a U.N. refugee agency report citing data from 2015, the latest figure his team could find. That was before U.S. President Donald Trump, whose policies on migration have drawn criticism, was elected. Tee hee. The data is from 2015, y\u2019all\u2026 Guess who was president in 2015? But there\u2019s more\u2026 Nowak also said the figure of over 100,000 referred to the cumulative number of migrant children held in detention at any point during that year, whether \u201cfor two days or eight months or the whole year,\u201d not all simultaneously. So, unlike what the media professionals repeated without question or skepticism, the 100,000 figure does not refer to children currently imprisoned by Evil Trump. Rather, it refers to the children held by the media\u2019s Precious Barry. Oh, and that number is not a count of the children \u201cin custody at one particular time.\u201d Instead, it is a cumulative number of those held for various amounts of time (as little as two days) throughout the year. In other words, this statistic is utterly meaningless. It says nothing about anything involving America. All it shows \u2014 that is, if you are still dumb enough to assume the correction is correct \u2014 is that our southern border is being overwhelmed and we really, really, really need to build a big, beautiful wall. But let\u2019s talk about the bottom line\u2026 What kind of flaming idiot believes our immigration system has the facilities to hold 100,000 children? Yeah, I wish. It gets worse, because you not only have to believe we have the facilities to hold 100,000 people; if you are told those 100,000 are children, you have to believe we have the facilities to also hold the adults who accompanied them. So now we are talking about \u2014 what? \u2014 250,000 people? In other words, our co-called media professionals, those oh-so-responsible, capital-\u201cJ\u201d journalists who attended J-school, who are buried in layers of professional fact checkers and layers of editorial accountability, blindly reported that President Trump currently has in custody more people than the population of Scottsdale, Arizona; of Reno, Nevada; of Lubbock, Texas; of Boise, Idaho; of San Bernardino, California; of Jersey City, New Jersey. The population of Orlando, Florida, is 285,000. This is how stupid, corrupt, inept, compromised, and desperate-to-lie the media are. I mean, how does any thinking adult \u2014 much less a \u201cjournalist\u201d \u2014 publish something like this without a hint of skepticism, without following up, without doing some digging, without using the Google Machine? But here\u2019s the saddest thing\u2026 Here\u2019s why the media are so dangerous\u2026 The only reason this ridiculous story was retracted was because of the date, because the numbers are from 2015, because the report is critical of the media\u2019s Precious Barry. That\u2019s the only reason the media bothered to eventually tell the truth. Had this stupid report targeted Trump, the media would have done what it always does after spreading fake news about Trump: added a few stealth edits about how the number is \u201ccumulative,\u201d and then pretended that was a distinction without a difference because the Orange Bad Man is a Nazi.

I\u2019m afraid I disagree. I think they know exactly what\u2019s happening and approve of it. They want a strong man rule. They don\u2019t want the chaos of democracy,\u201d Schrader wrote. \u201cThey revere democracy in principle but hate it in practice. They are nativists. They are the crowds that lined the streets in Nuremberg in 1933. The question is: are there more of them or more of us?\u201d From Paul Schrader\u2019s Facebook Schrader was reacting to a CNN report on polls showing that\u00a0many respondents have already made up their minds on impeaching President Trump, regardless of what actually happens during the hearings. The remarks represent Schrader\u2019s most strongly worded statements against President Trump and those who voted for him since the filmmaker called for violence\u00a0in a rambling post shortly after the 2016 presidential election. \u201cI have spent the last five days meditating on Trump\u2019s election,\u201d Schrader wrote at the time on Facebook. \u201cUpon consideration, I believe this is a call to violence. I felt the call to violence in the 60\u2019s and I feel it now again. This attack on liberty and tolerance will not be solved by appeasement.\u201d \u201cWe should finance those who support violence resistance. We should be willing to take arms.\u00a0Like Old John Brown, I am willing to battle with my children. Alt right nut jobs swagger violence. It\u2019s time to actualize that violence.\u201d The Raging Bull\u00a0scribe\u00a0later revealed that those comments landed him in trouble with the Department of Homeland Security. \u201cI did get visited by Homeland Security this year because I posted something on Facebook about Donald Trump and the John Brown moment we are now in. So they came and visited me to ascertain whether I am a threat to the president\u2019s life. I am not \u2014 except in theory,\u201d he told Variety. He told Rolling Stone that he was able to convince Homeland Security that he didn\u2019t pose a threat to the president. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t very hard. I just explained the five stages of grief. And that anger was one of them.\u201d Schrader, who received his first Academy Award nomination this year for First Reformed, is the latest entertainment industry figure to compare President Trump and his supporters to the Third Reich. Filmmaker Judd Apatow, \u00a0actress-singer Cher, and actresses Ashley Judd and Patricia Arquette have all compared President Trump to the Nazis or Adolf Hitler.

      "subtitle": "The House Intelligence Committee is expected to hear from Laura Cooper, the top Pentagon official overseeing U.S. policy towards Russia, Ukraine, and Eurasia, during an open hearing Wednesday afternoon.",
      "author": "Edwin Mora",
      "content": " She testified behind closed doors on October 23 despite the Pentagon saying it would not comply with the impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump. Cooper mainly focused on the Trump administration\u2019s decision to withhold the Congressionally-approved assistance to Ukraine despite the Pentagon\u2019s recommendation that the U.S. distribute it. House Democrats pursuing the impeachment probe are trying to determine if Trump abused his power by allegedly pressuring Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, in exchange for unfreezing the aid. Lawmakers will potentially question Cooper about what she knew about the holdup of military aid to Ukraine, and whether that decision was part of a scheme to pressure the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during a July 25 call into launching investigations that would have benefitted Trump politically. On September 11, the U.S. released the aid to Ukraine without having to do anything in return as part of a quid pro quo alleged in a \u201cwhistleblower\u201d complaint that triggered the impeachment probe. Key Democrat Talking Points Dozens of Republicans who were not part of the House panels conducting the probe famously interrupted the closed-door meeting in the basement of the capitol in protest to being excluded from the meeting. Democrats will likely try to play that up to make it seem they were trying to prevent Cooper from criticizing Trump. Cooper testified on October 23 that during a July meeting, many in the administration raised concerns that Trump may have lacked the legal authority to freeze aid after Congress had approved it.\u00a0She told House investigators that Trump had to notify Congress of the hold on aid. \u201cSo the comments in the room at the deputies\u2019 level reflected a sense that there was not an understanding of how this could legally play out,\u201d Cooper testified behind closed doors. \u201cAnd at that meeting, the deputies agreed to look into the legalities and to look at what was possible.\u201d Cooper described Trump\u2019s decision to hold aid as \u201cunusual\u201d during her closed-door deposition, noting that Ukraine was at war with Russia. Democrats will try to focus on Cooper\u2019s knowledge of discussions among various federal agencies about freezing the aid to Ukraine. They will try to grill her on answering who, exactly, directed that the U.S. withhold the security assistance and whether it was leveraged to pressure Ukraine to launch investigations into the Bidens. Cooper suggested she had a \u201cvery strong inference\u201d that the Ukrainians knew there was a hold on U.S. funding as of August 20, after the July 25 call between Trump and Zelensky at the heart of the impeachment probe. Democrats and their media allies claim that undercuts a vital defense of Trump: that there could be no quid pro quo because Ukraine did not know that the U.S. had withheld aid. Cooper\u2019s comments, however, suggest that Ukraine did not know the U.S. had frozen the aid at the time of the July 25 call, suggesting that there could be no quid pro quo during that conversation. What the Democrats Don\u2019t Want You to Hear Trump held the aid to Ukraine over corruption concerns. Combating corruption in Ukraine is a significant component of U.S. policy. Several impeachment inquiry witnesses have testified that there were merits to the corruption investigations into the company that hired Hunter Biden sought by Trump. While several impeachment witnesses have been dismayed by the decision to hold aid, the U.S. ultimately released the security without Ukraine doing anything in return. Democrats are trying to move beyond the quid pro quo narrative, claiming Trump engaged in extortion and bribing, but witnesses have denied the new allegation. Unlike his predecessor, Trump approved lethal aid to Ukraine to help them in their fight against Russia. On Wednesday, Intelligence Committee ranking member Rep. Devin Nunes (D-CA) noted that Democrats had not released the transcript of the closed-door deposition Saturday of White House Office of Management and Budget Mark Sandy, who told Congress the real reason the aid had ben withheld. Cooper, officially the deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia, Ukraine, and Eurasia testified last month that her role primarily focuses on the Pentagon\u2019s long-term strategy and current policy toward Russia. Regarding Ukraine, she mainly focused her work on fostering a strong relationship with the country\u2019s Defense Ministry and \u201cbuilding the capacity of the Ukrainian Armed Forces to resist Russian aggression.\u201d Trump\u2019s lethal assistance likely helped build that capacity.

When asked by Castor if Giuliani\u2019s request was expressing the desires of Trump himself, Sondland said he only assumed that. He said he assumed it because Trump had said \u201ctalk to Rudy,\u201d during a May 23 meeting when Sondland and several others tried to get Trump to engage with the newly-elected Ukrainian president. \u201cI\u2019m not testifying that I heard the president tell Guiliani to tell us,\u201d Sondland said. Sondland also testified earlier in his testimony that he called Trump on September 9 to ask what he wanted from Ukraine.

The rapper, along with his two bodyguards, on Aug. 14 were given \u201cconditional sentences,\u201d meaning they wouldn\u2019t serve prison time unless they commit a similar offense the in the future. Among those urging Trump to try to free the rapper were first lady Melania Trump, Kanye West and Kim Kardashian West.

This district is a key district Republicans need to hold if they want to retake the House majority in 2020\u2019s upcoming congressional elections. With King\u2019s retirement, it opens the seat\u2013which the Cook Political Report\u2019s Partisan Voting Index rates as an R-plus-3 district\u2013to potential attack from the left. But, if Republicans are able to hold this seat and others from which other members are retiring, and win back a net 19 or more seats from Democrats in 2020, they would retake the majority next year. There are currently 31 district represented by Democrats that President Trump won in 2016, making it possible for Republicans to run the tables and retake the House if Trump hits his marks from 2016 again next year.",

It does not matter how many times removed the testimony of the \u201cwitness\u201d is from actual firsthand information. And it does not matter how jaundiced or opinionated the testimony is. So long as it smears President\u00a0Trump, then it can be tossed like a wet log onto the bonfire to burn President\u00a0Trump\u00a0at the stake. Take the precious \u201cwhistleblower\u201d who sparked the impeachment furor. This partisan bureaucrat has no actual firsthand information to offer. His testimony would, literally, not be allowed in court. A judge would punish a prosecutor for even mentioning the existence of such a witness and admonish the jury to erase any hint of his testimony from their minds. Yet this \u201cwitness\u201d is protected and coddled. Democrats on the House intelligence committee raise all sorts of crazy alarms about how people are somehow threatening the life of this revered bureaucrat if his name is uttered \u2014 never mind that virtually everybody in\u00a0Washington\u00a0thinks they already know exactly who it is and have gotten in on the game of not uttering his name. You mean to tell me we are going to impeach a president and remove him from office-based entirely on the whistle blown by a partisan bureaucrat who can never be named? That is seriously the state of \u201cjournalism\u201d in America today? What will the history books say? Then along comes former Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, publicly testifying on national television about all of her opinions of President\u00a0Trump\u00a0and his policies in Ukraine. OK, we get it. State Department loyalists don\u2019t like\u00a0Mr. Trump\u00a0or his foreign policy. Great. Go run for office. Until then, shut up. And then the whole place goes nuts because President\u00a0Trump\u00a0\u2014 denied the right to have his own attorney cross-examine these fake witnesses in this fake trial about fake crimes \u2014 takes to Twitter to defend himself. The tweets take on those precious witnesses who are serenaded all over town for the \u201cbravery\u201d of taking the stand to declare their hatred for\u00a0Donald Trump. These people don\u2019t have a shred of the integrity, honesty and bravery that exists in just one small finger of a truly brave child who stands before a real criminal in a real trial and accuses him of a real crime. \u2022\u00a0Charles Hurt can be reached at\u00a0churt@washingtontimes.com\u00a0and on Twitter on @charleshurt.",

From your testimony, it is hard to tell whether you even realize how badly you are being used \u2014 and dis-served \u2014 by gutless political hacks hellbent on destroying your commander-in-chief for personal political gain. Whether you realize it or not, you have been dragged into an exhaustive conspiracy to undo the 2016 election and prevent the 2020 election. People call it an attempted coup and that really is exactly what it is. You are a jilted policy analyst who is upset that your boss did not stick to the talking points you wrote for him in a phone call with the leader of another country \u2014 a country you obviously admire greatly. Your boss happens to be someone who \u2014 unlike you \u2014 presented himself before the American people in a campaign for the presidency. And \u2014 also unlike you \u2014 he was elected president. That man was elected to represent the American people. As such, it is his job to set American foreign policy. Not yours. That is why we have elections in this country. Other than recounting basic agreed-upon timelines of meetings and phone calls, your testimony was mainly opinion. It was your concern that the new president was not reciting your talking points and even may have been altering foreign policy \u2014 a prerogative that is in his domain and his domain alone. The only exceptions, according to the Constitution, are treaties and declarations of war, which require Senate approval. Nowhere in the Constitution does it say anything about any kind of policy analyst \u2014 in uniform or otherwise \u2014 who has any authority whatsoever to override or undermine foreign policies set by those elected by the American people. In your testimony, you complained that President Trump failed to recite your talking points about \u201ccorruption\u201d in Ukraine. That is actually worse than just your irrelevant opinion. It is false. President Trump absolutely did raise the topic of corruption in Ukraine. He just happened to talk about corruption in Ukraine that Democrats in Congress \u2014 and apparently you, too \u2014 wish to ignore. Again,\u00a0Mr. Vindman, we appreciate your service to the country. In fact, it is the reverence for military service that should have inspired you to leave your uniform at home. Unlike countless other military officers who testify before Congress, you were not speaking on behalf of the military or the country. You were there to bleat your irrelevant opinions about things far above your pay grade. The honor of that uniform is rooted in the tradition of selflessly serving your country. It is the best that uniform stands for. Not self-absorbed preening before the cameras to peacock all your stupid opinions about how you disagree with your commander-in-chief. So, for the sake of all your fellow service members, leave the uniform at home the next time you take part in a political show trial that is all part of an orchestrated coup. \u2022\u00a0Contact Charles Hurt at\u00a0churt@washingtontimes.com\u00a0or on Twitter @charleshurt.

After President Trump threatened\u00a0tariffs on the computers made in China, Apple decided to have the computer built in Texas. The Mac Pro will be assembled by Flex \u2014 a manufacturing company in Austin, Texas. During the visit, Trump praised Apple for becoming the first trillion-dollar company in the United States, calling Cook \u201ca very special person\u201d in the country. Apple broke ground on its $1 billion campus in Austin on Wednesday. The new building will add about 5,000 employees in 2022, with expansion capacity for 15,000. Cook thanked President Trump and Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Ivanka Trump for visiting the facility and praised the new Mac Pro computer that would be manufactured in the United States. Cook said the Mac Pro computer was 15,000 times more powerful than the original Mac, performing 56 trillion tasks per second. \u201cWe could not be more proud of the product. It\u2019s an example of American design and American manufacturing and American ingenuity,\u201d he said. The Mac Pro computer represents only a small portion of Apple\u2019s business, while the iPhone continues to be manufactured in China. Trump hinted that he would consider a tariff exemption for Apple\u2019s manufacturing in China. \u201cWe\u2019ll look into that,\u201d Trump said when asked about a tariff exemption for Apple.\u00a0\u201cWe have to treat Apple on a somewhat similar basis as we treat Samsung.\u201d When Trump asked Cook about the economy, the Apple CEO replied, \u201cI think we have the strongest economy.\u201d Cook continues to court Trump, participating in White House events having to do with economic development and tech education. Cook also serves as an adviser on the Trump administration\u2019s workforce development initiative. Trump\u2019s visit to the facility drew both supporters of the president and protesters.

In August, Biden compared Trump to the Ku Klux Klan, claiming the president had used \u201cdog whistle\u201d language to signal it was acceptable to be racist. \u201cThis is a president who has said things no other president has said since Andrew Jackson,\u201d Biden told Anderson Cooper during an interview on CNN. \u201cNobody\u2019s said anything like the things he\u2019s saying.\u201d \u201cWe went through it after the Civil War in terms of the Ku Klux Klan and white supremacy,\u201d the former vice president added. \u201cThis is about separating people into the good and bad in his mind. It\u2019s about an access to power, its a trait used by charlatans all over the world \u2026 divide people, pit them against one another.\u201d",

      "author": "Charlie Spiering",
      "content": " \u201cI don\u2019t think this president cares one bit about farmers,\u201d he claimed. Buttigieg\u2019s claim is clearly false, as the president has delivered for farmers in a big way. Despite the punishing trade war\u2019s effect on agricultural products exported to China, Trump delivered $12 billion to farmers in payments in 2018 and an additional $16 billion in payments in 2019. The farmers agree. Fifty-six percent of farmers in a recent Iowa State University poll said they supported imposing tariffs on Chinese products, while only 30 percent opposed them. The survey featured 693 Iowa, Illinois, and Minnesota farmers from February through June. It is rare that Trump has a public event without talking about farmers, and he repeatedly includes big purchases of agricultural products in any negotiations with China. During the outline of a \u201cfirst phase\u201d trade agreement with China announced in October, Trump said that they agreed to $50 billion in farm purchases. The first phase agreement has yet to be signed. Trump also negotiated a new trade deal (USMCA) with Mexico and Canada to replace NAFTA, earning important concessions in favor of American farmers, despite House Democrats failing to put the deal on the floor for a vote. The president also reversed the Waters of the United States (WOTUS) rule leveled by the Obama administration, a provision that was making it harder for farmers to control their land. \u201cI had to kill it,\u201d Trump explained during a speech to the New York Economic Club last week. \u201cIt made land development prohibitive. It made impossible situations for farmers, for everybody.\u201d",

      "author": "John Binder",
      "content": " \u201cThe real point here is that we need to stop this man-made crisis at the border,\u201d Warren said. \u201cTrump is the one who has created this crisis. \u2026 When I found out that our government was actually taking away children from their families, I went down to the border.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s like a giant Amazon warehouse filled with cages of women, cages of men, and cages of little girls and little boys,\u201d Warren said. \u201cA great nation does not separate children from their families.\u201d As Breitbart News has chronicled, migrants are more often than not brutalized while making their journey to the U.S.-Mexico border. In a recent case, a federal immigration official said a pregnant migrant \u2014 saved by Border Patrol agents \u2014 was beaten by cartel smugglers because she did not pay her debt. After Border Patrol agents took her to a nearby hospital, the woman was treated for her injuries, while her child died as a result of the beating. Mexican drug cartels have profited\u00a0billions from America\u2019s open border through the drug trade and human trafficking, increasing their power in Mexico. Since 2009, there have been more than\u00a0250,000 homicides\u00a0in Mexico and at least 30,000 disappearances. In 2017, there were\u00a026,573 murders, 1,275 kidnappings, and 5,357 extortion cases in Mexico, marking the bloodiest year in the country in 20 years, despite these figures not capturing the scope of the cartel violence occurring\u00a0in Mexico. For Americans, the illegal immigration crisis is very real. In the last year alone, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents arrested\u00a0more than 6,600 convicted murderers and convicted sex offenders who were in the United States illegally. Of that total, 4,975 of the illegal aliens arrested were convicted sex offenders. The other 1,641 illegal aliens had been convicted of homicide. Another 1,913 illegal aliens that were arrested by ICE had pending sex offense charges against them, while 387 illegal aliens had pending murder charges against them. For each one of these crimes, there are at least one or more American and legal immigrant victims. John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News. Follow him on Twitter at\u00a0@JxhnBinder.",

However, the United States cosigned a letter with the United Nations this year, backing sanctions against North Korea, according to Breitbart News. The article continued: The Trump administration has insisted it will not ease sanctions\u00a0on Pyongyang\u00a0over its nuclear program until Kim can prove the nation has completely, irreversibly, ended it. The U.N. letter that\u00a0offended the North Koreans \u2013 reportedly also signed by France, Germany, and the United Kingdom \u2013 reiterated that commitment and urged\u00a0other nations to adhere to the sanctions. In July, the U.S. State Department denied reports from South Korea that said President Trump might ease the sanctions on North Korea and called them \u201ccompletely false.\u201d \u201c[W]hile we don\u2019t preview any sort of sanctions from the podium, whether it\u2019s adding new ones or taking them away, I will say that I did actually speak to Steve Biegun about that, and he categorically denied that,\u201d said State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus. In fact, a July report by the\u00a0Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency (KOTRA) said that North Korea\u2019s trade volume was cut in half last year as a result of the U.N. sanctions, according to Breitbart News. The report stated: The KOTRA report showed North Korea\u2019s trade volume falling to $2.84 billion in 2018, a 48.8 percent decline from the previous year.\u00a0Exports fell by a dizzying 86.3 percent, imports declined 31.2 percent, and the North Korean trade deficit rose by 17.5 percent. In October, the North Korean government\u2019s news agency called American officials \u201cstubborn\u201d for their refusal to ease the sanctions: It is an undeniable reality that denuclearization and sanctions are misused as tools for meeting party interests and strategies of the political forces within the U.S., not to solve bottleneck problems between the DPRK and the U.S. to even a certain extent. Finally, Trump did not cave to North Korean diplomat\u00a0Kwon Jong Gun\u2019s demands for the president to fire U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo after he refused to end the sanctions on the rogue nation.",

Earlier Wednesday evening, Harris argued during the debate that President Trump had gotten \u201cpunked\u201d on foreign policy regarding his administration\u2019s denuclearization negotiations with North Korea. When asked whether she would have held a summit with Kim, Harris replied: \u201cWith all due deference to the fact this is a presidential debate, Donald Trump got punked.\u201d \u201cHe has conducted foreign policy since day one borne out of a very fragile ego,\u201d she continued. \u201cThat fails to understand that one of the most important responsibilities of the commander-in-chief is to concern herself with the security of our nation and homeland. And to do it in a way that understands that part of the strength of who we are as a nation, and therefore an extension of our ability to be secure is not only that we have a vibrant military, but that when we walk in any room around the globe, we are respected because we keep to our word, we are consistent, we speak truth, and we are loyal.\u201d Pressed on whether she would cut North Korea slack as a negotiating tactic if elected president, the flailing White House candidate stated: \u201cNot at this point. There are no concessions to be made. He has traded a photo-op for nothing.\u201d She added: He has abandoned the\u2014 by shutting down the operations with South Korea for the last year and a half, so those operations which should be and those exercises which should be active because they are within our best national security, the relationship that we have in Japan, he has in every way compromised our ability to have any influence on slowing down or at least having a check and balance on North Korea\u2019s nuclear program.\u201d ",

Trump has spent months talking about how trade tariffs on China are damaging its economy, while the U.S. enjoyed a record-setting 11-year expansion, the Washington Post reported.

Jim Jordan (R-OH) is far from impressed with Holmes:  11:35 A.M.\u00a0\u2014 Pelosi:\u00a0\u201cThe evidence is clear that the President has used his office for his own personal gain and in doing so undermined the national security of the United States by withholding military assistance to Ukraine to the benefit of the Russians.\u201d 11:30 A.M.\u00a0\u2014 House Speaker Nancy\u00a0Pelosi (D-CA) is pressed\u00a0on the partisan nature of the impeachment inquiry, responds with the claim: \u201cRepublicans are in denial about the facts. if they don\u2019t want to honor their oath of office, I don\u2019t think we should be characterized as partisan.\u201d  11:23 A.M.\u00a0\u2014 Good question via Mark Levin:  11:15 A.M.\u00a0\u2014 President Trump\u2019s re-election campaign sends out an email blast pushing back against Hill and Schiff\u2019s dismissal of Ukrainian meddling in the 2016 election: There\u2019s a simple reason Adam Schiff wants to deny\u00a0Ukraine interfered in U.S. politics: He was willing to collude with them. Ukraine\u2019s interference in the 2016 election against Donald Trump\u00a0was well documented in multiple mainstream news reports. No one denies Russia\u2019s interference\u2014in fact,\u00a0Republicans authored a report on it. Democrats must answer three key questions: 1. Separate from the fact that Russia was behind the hacking of the DNC, do you maintain that Ukraine did absolutely nothing to influence America\u2019s 2016 election? 2. Do you believe U.S. Attorney John Durham\u2019s investigation is legitimate? DOJ has said he is \u201cexploring the extent to which\u201d Ukraine played a role in the 2016 election. 3. Should Ukraine cooperate with the U.S. Department of Justice in its investigation? 11:08 A.M.\u00a0\u2014  11:04 A.M.\u00a0\u2014 The hearing is now in recess.  11:00 A.M.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Hill\u00a0says former National Security Advisor John Bolton\u2019s description of a \u201cdrug deal that Mulvaney and Sondland were cooking up\u201d: \u201cI took it to mean investigations for a meeting.\u201d 10:54 A.M.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Hill says that President Trump believed NSC official Kash Patel headed up Ukraine affairs, not\u00a0Lt. Col. Alexander\u00a0Vindman, and could have given the president information without her knowledge.  10:49 A.M.\u00a0\u2014 House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) once again calls for Schiff to allow the so-called \u201cwhistleblower\u201d and Hunter Biden to testify as part of the impeachment inquiry hearings.  10:48 A.M.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Hill says Giuliani made \u201cincendiary remarks\u201d on television and pushes reports that she claims would \u201ccome back to haunt us.\u201d 10:47 A.M.\u00a0\u2014  10:43 A.M.\u00a0\u2014  10:40 A.M.\u00a0\u2014 Homes is coming off as increasingly partial to\u00a0Yovanovich\u2019s views on Ukraine than those of President Trump.  10:39 A.M.\u00a0\u2014 Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC) weighs in on today\u2019s hearings:  10:38 A.M.\u00a0\u2014 Hill of the Trump-Zelensky call:\u00a0\u201cI found this particular call\u2019s subject matter and the way that it was conducted, surprising.\u201d 10:36 A.M.\u00a0\u2014 Holmes says of the Trump-Sondland call:\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this in my foreign service career.\u201d 10:34 A.M.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Holmes says Sondland \u201csort of winced\u201d when President Trump came on the phone and \u201cheld the phone away from his ear.\u201d \u201cIt was quite loud when the president came on, quite distinctive,\u201d he adds. 10:29 A.M.\u00a0\u2014 Holmes claims Ukrainians still feel under pressure from President Trump: \u201cThey\u2019re being very careful.\u201d Zelenksy has repeatedly said he felt no pressure to probe into allegations of corruption against former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, during the July 25th call with the president. 10:26 A.M.\u00a0\u2014 Biggs fact-checks Hill on\u00a0Russian meddling efforts:  10:25 A.M.\u00a0\u2014  10:22 A.M.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Hill\u00a0tells Schiff of Russian meddling campaigns: \u201cI just want to again emphasize as we discuss all of these issues, not to give them more fodder that they can use against us in 2020.\u201d 10:20 A.M.\u00a0\u2014 This is true, from Biggs:  10:17 A.M.\u00a0\u2014 President Trump quotes Ken Starr\u2019s analysis on impeachment:  10:17 A.M.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0\u00a0Hill: \u201cWhen we are consumed by partisan rancor, we cannot combat these external forces as they seek to divide us against each another, degrade our institutions, and destroy the faith of the American people in our democracy.\u201d 10:16 A.M.\u00a0\u2014  10:15 A.M.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0 Hill\u00a0claims of reports stating Ukraine meddled in 2016 elections: \u201cThis is a fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves.\u201d 10:14 A.M.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0 Hill:\u00a0\u201cI grew up poor with a very distinctive working-class accent. In England in the 1980s and 1990s, this would have impeded my professional advancement. This background has never set me back in America.\u201d 10:13 A.M.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Hill begins her opening statement, says:\u00a0\u201cI have no interest in advancing the outcome of your inquiry in any particular direction, except toward the truth.\u201d 10:09 A.M.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Holmes ends his opening statement by lecturing the Trump administration over its policy toward Ukraine, stating the country\u00a0deserves better. Reminder:\u00a0President\u00a0Trump approved\u00a0the sale of 210\u00a0Javelin\u00a0anti-tank\u00a0missiles\u00a0and 37 launchers to Ukraine in March 2018\u00a0\u2014 something the Obama administration did not do.  10:08 A.M.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Holmes: \u201cUkrainians want to hear a clear and unambiguous reaffirmation that our long-standing, bipartisan policy of strong support for Ukraine remains unchanged and that we fully back it at the highest levels.\u201d 10:03 A.M.\u00a0\u2014  10:01 A.M.\u00a0\u2014 Rep. Andy Biggs (R-AZ) rips Holmes\u2019s testimony, says he sounds like a \u201cdiscontented deep-state bureaucrat.\u201d  10:00 A.M.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Holmes: \u201cBetween meetings on August 27th, I heard Ambassador Bolton express to Ambassador Taylor and National Security Council Senior Director Tim Morrison his frustration about Mr. Giuliani\u2019s influence with the President, making clear there was nothing he could do about it.\u201d 9:58 A.M.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Holmes: \u201cAmbassador Sondland told the President he should let A$AP Rocky get sentenced, then play the \u2018race card\u2019 and give him a ticker-tape parade when he gets home, you can tell the Kardashians you tried.\u201d 9:56 A.M.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Holmes continues on\u00a0Sondland\u2019s call with President Trump: \u201c[He] went on to state that President Zelenskyy \u2018loves your ass.\u2019 I then heard President Trump ask, \u2018So, he\u2019s gonna do the investigation?\u2019 Ambassador Sondland replied that \u2018he\u2019s gonna do it,\u2019 adding that President Zelenskyy will do \u2018anything you ask him to.'\u201d 9:54 A.M.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Holmes says of President Trump\u2019s call with Sondland: \u201cThe President\u2019s voice was very loud and recognizable, and Ambassador Sondland held the phone away from his ear for a period of time, presumably because of the loud volume.\u201d 9:52 A.M.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Holmes: \u201cI was deeply disappointed to see that the President raised none of what I understood to be our inter-agency agreed-upon foreign policy priorities in Ukraine and instead raised the Biden/Burisma investigation and referred to the theory about Crowdstrike.\u201d 9:49 A.M.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Holmes: \u201cOn June 28, while President Trump was still not moving forward on a meeting with President Zelenskiy, he met with Russian President Putin at the G20 Summit in Osaka, Japan, sending a further signal of lack of support for Ukraine.\u201d Strange framing from Holmes considering\u00a0President\u00a0Trump approved\u00a0the sale of 210\u00a0Javelin\u00a0anti-tank\u00a0missiles\u00a0and 37 launchers to Ukraine in March 2018\u00a0\u2014 something the Obama administration resisted. 9:48 A.M.\u00a0\u2014 Holmes\u2019s use of the term\u00a0\u201cThree Amigos\u201d\u00a0\u2014 a reference to\u00a0Sondland, Energy Secretary Rick Perry and former Special Envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker\u00a0\u2014 is not going unnoticed:  9:43 A.M.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Holmes claims U.S. Ambassador to E.U. Gordan Sondland once said: \u201cDammit Rudy. Every time Rudy gets involved he goes and\u00a0f\u2014s everything up.\u201d  9:40 A.M.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Holmes: \u201cThe barrage of allegations directed at Ambassador Yovanovitch, a career ambassador, is unlike anything I have seen in my professional career.\u201d  9:37 A.M.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Holmes: \u201cMr. Lutsenko made a series of unsupported allegations against Ambassador Yovanovitch, mostly suggesting that Ambassador Yovanovitch improperly used the Embassy to advance the political interests of the Democratic Party.\u201d 9:36 A.M.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Holmes:\u00a0\u201cAs the impeachment inquiry has progressed, I have followed press reports and reviewed the statements of Ambassador Taylor and Ambassador Yovanovitch. Based on my experience in Ukraine, my recollection is generally consistent with their testimony.\u201d 9:35 A.M.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Holmes: \u201cI am an apolitical foreign policy professional, and my job is to focus on the politics of the country in which I serve so that we can better understand the local landscape and better advance U.S. national interests there.\u201d 9:34 A.M.\u00a0\u2014 Holmes begins his opening statement:\u00a0\u201cBeginning in March 2019, our support for Ukrainian democratic resistance to Russian aggression \u2026 became overshadowed by a political agenda being promoted by [Rudy Giuliani] and a cadre of officials operating with a direct channel to the White House.\u201d  9:33 A.M.\u00a0\u2014 Read Holmes\u2019s opening statement below:  9:32 A.M.\u00a0\u2014 Hill and Holmes are being sworn in.  9:30 A.M.\u00a0\u2014 Conservative radio host Mark Levin offers analysis on Schiff\u2019s strategy for the impeachment hearings:   9:29 A.M.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Nunes on impeachment: \u201cI sincerely hope the Democrats end this affair as quickly as possible so our nation can begin to heal.\u201d  9:23 A.M.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Nunes: \u201cLadies and gentlemen, unless the Democrats once again scramble their kangaroo court rules, today\u2019s hearing marks the merciful end of this spectacle in the Impeachment Committee, formerly known as the Intelligence Committee.\u201d  9:21 A.M.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA) says in his opening statement that President Trump is being accused of committing \u201cthought crimes.\u201d  9:18 A.M.\u00a0\u2014 President Trump urges Americans to read the pair of transcripts of his telephone calls with Ukrainian President\u00a0Volodymyr Zelensky.  9:18 A.M.\u00a0\u2014 Rep.

In fact, yesterday was a disaster for the media and Democrats, the worst day so far for an impeachment inquiry that is quickly exhausting the patience of the American people. All the media got out of our ambassador to the European Union\u00a0Wednesday was the soundbite they so desperately desired, a soundbite where a witness (who, like all the other impeachment \u201cwitnesses,\u201d has witnessed nothing) said, \u201cThere was quid pro quo.\u201d Unfortunately for our media coup plotters, a soundbite is not evidence. But that won\u2019t stop the lying media from playing that soundbite over and over and over again as though it is evidence. The good news is that the fake media no longer control the flow of information, so here are all the facts the media are desperate to cover up about Sondland\u2019s bizarre testimony, about his inconvenient lies and equally inconvenient truths that handed the Democrats yet another no good, very bad, terrible impeachment day. After using his swaggering opening statement to pretend he had the goods on Trump and the entire administration \u2014 which suckered the fake media into slobbering all over themselves with \u201cgame over\u201d and \u201cnew John Dean\u201d tweets \u2014 we learned that he has no evidence whatsoever and that his \u201cbombshell\u201d soundbite is based only on a \u2014 get this \u2014 \u201cpresumption.\u201d \u201cNobody else on this\u00a0planet\u00a0told you that Donald Trump was tying this aid to the investigation,\u201d asked a Republican questioner. \u201cYou really have no evidence.\u201d \u201cOther than my own presumption,\u201d Sondland admitted, as the air seemed to leak out of him. And then came this bombshell\u2026 \u201cThat was the problem,\u201d Sondland confessed. \u201cNo one told me directly that the aid was tied to anything. I was presuming it was.\u201d Are you kidding me with this garbage? It gets worse. Because even that was a lie because someone did tell Sondland something, which brings me to the next thing the media do not want you to know\u2026 \u201cPresident Trump never told me directly that the aid was conditioned on meetings,\u201d Sondland admitted. \u201cThe aid was my own personal guess,\u201d he added. \u201cI never heard from President Trump that aid was conditioned on an announcement of investigations,\u201d Sondland admitted later. However\u2026 Trump did tell Sondland one thing\u2026 Trump explicitly told Sondland he wanted \u201cnothing\u201d from Ukraine. \u201cNo quid pro quo.\u201d When he was president, Barack Obama put his vice president, Joe Biden, in charge of diplomatic relations with Ukraine. During this same time, the corrupt oligarch of a corrupt Ukrainian energy company paid Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, $50,000 a month \u2014 a month! \u2014 to sit on the board of this corrupt energy company, Burisma. Fifty thousand a month \u2014 a month! \u2014 even though Hunter knows nothing about energy and doesn\u2019t speak the local language. Hunter made millions off this sweet deal. And then, when a Ukrainian prosecutor decided to look into Burisma, Joe threatened to withhold U.S. aid if the prosecutor was not fired. The prosecutor was fired. That is a full-blown act of corruption, but still\u2026 Our fake media are hoping to gaslight the American people into believing that Trump asking Ukraine to look into the Bidens\u2019 looting of that country is different from asking Ukraine to look into corruption. The reasons for the gaslighting campaign are obvious. The media are desperate to cover up the Bidens corruption while, at the same time, pulling off this coup with the false accusation that Trump was \u201cdigging up dirt on his opponent.\u201d No\u2026 The fact is this: Trump asking Ukraine to look into Burisma and the Bidens *is* looking into corruption, which is what we expect our president to do when it comes to foreign aid. Trump. Did. Nothing. Wrong. Someone should put that on a T-shirt. How can there be a quid pro quo if Ukraine didn\u2019t know there was a quid to quo? Over and over and over again, we are being told Ukraine did not feel pressure, never said to anyone that the promise of aid was tied to anything. Sadly for our coup plotters, this is one of the media\u2019s inconvenient truths Sondland testified to, and what the media don\u2019t want you to know is that this is a massive piece of exculpatory evidence\u2026 \u201cAnd you understood the Ukrainians received no credible explanation [for the pause in receiving aid], is that right?\u201d the Democrats\u2019 counsel, Daniel Goldman, asked. \u201cI certainly couldn\u2019t give them one,\u201d Sondland replied. And there you have it\u2026 If Ukraine didn\u2019t know, there can be no quid pro quo. In October, Sondland testified at Schiff\u2019s secret basement impeachment hearing that there was no quid pro quo. Afterwards, the anti-Trump Resistance bullied and threatened Sondland\u2019s livelihood, his business, even his family. Gee, you think that might have something to do with his offering up this \u201cquid pro quo\u201d soundbite that fell completely apart as soon as he was asked to back it up with something, anything\u2026? Get this\u2026 So far, Democrats have not presented even a single witness who witnessed anything. It is either third- and fourth-hand hearsay coming from these crybaby bureaucrats, or it\u2019s whining about their precious \u201cregular channels,\u201d or it\u2019s some lame attempt to reheat the transcript of the call in question into something it\u2019s not \u2014 as though we have not already read the transcript. Sondland is even worse. Sondland doesn\u2019t even have third- or fourth-hand testimony; all he has are his stupid presumptions that directly contradict what he was declaratively told by Trump himself. This was not just goalpost moving on the part of the coup plotters\u2026 This was an on-the-spot crafting of a whole new goalpost using baby poop and fairy dust. The Fart King Swalwell:\u00a0A meeting at the White House. If someone really needs a\u00a0meeting at the White House to\u00a0show their legitimacy to their\u00a0people, that leveraging that\u00a0meeting and asking for an\u00a0investigation would be wrong. Sondland:\u00a0To be candid, Congressman,\u00a0every meeting at the White House\u00a0has conditions placed on it. I\u00a0have never worked on a meeting\u00a0at the White House that doesn\u2019t\u00a0have a host of conditions placed\u00a0on it. Duh. Fart King:\u00a0If one of those conditions is\u00a0to investigate a political\u00a0opponent, you would agree that\u00a0would be wrong. Sondland:\u00a0The political opponent, yes, but making announcements or\u00a0investigations per se, no. You see, I would have asked this question\u2026 If one of the conditions of a White House visit is to open an investigation into the son of a powerful American politician who was paid $50,000 a month \u2014 a month! \u2014 by a corrupt Ukrainian energy company, even though the son had no energy experience and didn\u2019t speak the language, and then this powerful American politician used U.S. aid to threaten Ukraine into firing a prosecutor investigating the corrupt energy company that hired his son \u2014 would that be appropriate? But that\u2019s just me\u2026 Silly me and my belief in truth. And now, we come to my favorite piece of news the media do not want you to know\u2026 This moment took my breath away. Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA) spoke at length about a witness deposed in secret over the weekend, a witness who actually knows what happened with the foreign aid to Ukraine because that was this person\u2019s job. Nunes accused Adam Schiff of withholding this testimony from Sondland (Schiff disputes this), but that doesn\u2019t matter. Sondland did not read this testimony and admitted to Nunes that had he read it, this might have changed his mind about his presumption of a quid pro quo. NUNES: We\u2019re not going to hear about what the real reason the person who\u2019s in charge of making sure that foreign aid is delivered, we\u2019re not going to hear about what actually happened with the foreign aid. Wouldn\u2019t that had made it a lot easier for you to testify, instead of guessing \u2026 wouldn\u2019t it be easier if you just knew exactly why the foreign aid wasn\u2019t given? SONDLAND: It would have been easier to testify if I had a totality of the record. NUNES: And would you trust the person who\u2019s in charge of cutting the checks for foreign aid, a top career diplomat, or the top career official? SONDLAND: I\u2019d have no reason not to.

      "author": "John Carney",
      "content": " Fifty-seven percent of Americans approved of President Trump\u2019s handling of the economy, up from 53 percent in August and 50 percent in May. Approval is dramatically improved from the early days of his presidency, when just 48 percent said they approved. The share of Americans who say they disapprove of Trump\u2019s economic policies fell to just 42 percent, the lowest level on record. This was as high as 48 percent when Trump took office, nearly tied with his 47 percent approval rating. So the latest results show Americans have become more united in support of Trump\u2019s economic policies. Trump has not, however, gained support for his trade policies. Forty-five percent said they approved of Trump\u2019s foreign trade policies in February 2017. In the November 2019 survey, forty-four percent said they approved. The low point on this measure came in August 2018, shortly after the Trump administration began to raise tariffs on China and imported metals, when approval dropped to 39 percent. So Trump has won back support as the trade war has progressed. As in many other areas, Trump enjoys massive approval by members of his own party on economic issues. Ninety-three percent of Republicans say they approve of Trump\u2019s handling of the economy, versus just 18 percent of Democrats. But Trump wins strong marks from independents, 60 percent of whom say they approve of his handling of the economy. There\u2019s a generational barbell shape to support for Trump on the economy. Fifty-six percent of those between 18 and 34 approve and 62 percent of those older than 55 approve. But just 49 percent between 35 and 54 approve. ",

Napolitano said, \u201cI think the Democrats do still have a case.

McCarthy told Fox News Channel bribery is \u201cnot a straightforward crime,\u201d and as a result could be difficult to prove under the law. \u201cThe more you get to a kind of a hypertechnical violation of the law \u2026 the higher a prosecutor\u2019s burden would be to show willfulness and intent and understanding and evidence along those lines,\u201d McCarthy explained. \u201cI think the problem that you have with bribery, in particular, which is what the Democrats\u2019 current theory is, is that, you know, we all have kind of a common usage, understanding of what bribery is. And as I\u2019ve maintained, I think the framers had a very specific understanding of the kind of bribery in the nature of treason that is the bribery they intended in the impeachment clause of the Constitution. He continued, \u201cBut the bribery statute itself that the Democrats are relying on is not like one straightforward crime.

When you talk to me, I hear you,\u201d Cuomo\u2019s mother said, essentially disapproving her son\u2019s theory that she did not respond because she could not hear him.

Say hello to Dana Bash,\u201d Cuomo said, appearing to press another button on his phone. It is likely, in that moment, that he took his phone off speaker, given how the remainder of the conversation went. \u201cHi, Mrs. Cuomo. How are you?\u201d Bash asked. Her question was followed by silence. It seems Cuomo\u2019s mom was answering the question, but her voice \u2014 not on speaker \u2014 was completely unintelligible and ultimately resulted in what amounted to another awkward moment of silence for CNN viewers. \u201cAlright,\u201d Cuomo said, hanging up. \u201cThis is not on speakerphone. It\u2019s regular phone. It\u2019s two feet away from Dana; she can hear my mother.

      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " The poll, which coincided with\u00a0the seventh public impeachment hearing in the nation\u2019s capital, found that opposition to the partisan impeachment effort is growing, while support is slipping. Conducted\u00a0November 17-20, 2019, among\u00a01,092 registered voters, the poll found that a greater percentage of people now oppose impeachment than support it. \u201cSupport for impeachment has flipped since October from 48% support with 44% opposing to now 45% opposed and 43% in support,\u201d Emerson found. The greatest shift in opinion occurred among independent voters, who now\u00a0oppose impeachment 49 percent to 34 percent. Last month, independents supported impeachment 48 percent to 39 percent. More via Emerson: The impeachment hearings are being watched or followed by 69% of voters. A plurality (26%) is getting their information from Fox News, 24% are getting their information from 1 of the 3 network stations (ABC, NBC, CBS), 16% are watching CNN, 15% MSNBC and 19% are going somewhere else for their information. The margin of error is +/- 2.9 percent. The results coincide with a\u00a0Politico-Morning Consult poll\u00a0released\u00a0this week, which showed support for impeachment dropping and opposition growing, particularly among independents. As Breitbart News reported: The survey was taken November 15-17 among\u00a01,994 registered voters and found that 47 percent of independents actively oppose the impeachment inquiry. This figure is a 10-point increase from last week, as\u00a0noted\u00a0by the\u00a0Hill. Independent support for the inquiry fell to 40 percent \u2013 a seven-point drop. Overall, support for the inquiry dropped by two points and opposition grew by three points. Nonetheless, some left-wing politicians, such as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), believe the public impeachment hearings are actively convincing the American people that \u201cwe have a president who thinks he\u2019s above the law.\u201d \u201cBut what I am of the opinion is that the American people now do believe, and the more they see these impeachment hearings on television, they do believe that we have a president who thinks he\u2019s above the law,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWe have a president who has engaged in corruption. We have a president who has obstructed justice and, in my view, somebody who\u2019s violated the emoluments clause,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut my inclination is that the American people do believe that this president is in violation of the law,\u201d he added:",

The funding measure would fund the government through December 2020, giving congressional lawmakers weeks to figure out how to agree to a longer-term spending agreement. Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby (R-AL) said Thursday he remains optimistic about potential spending deals. \u201cOur numbers have gotten closer and closer. But sometimes we are ready to close the curtain and make things work and the demands go up on the other side,\u201d he said. \u201cThey seem to change the agenda from time to time.\u201d The Alabama Republican also said that the government will have to resolve the issue of how much money to give to Trump to continue funding the wall along the southern border. Shelby said, \u201cBorder wall is going to have to be resolved before we get some type of legislation. Now, border wall is not directly connected, but indirectly, to the allocations.\u201d The Senate also shot down Paul\u2019s Penny Plan amendment, otherwise known as S.2792, to the spending bill, which would help improve America\u2019s infrastructure. The Penny Plan infrastructure plan would make minute cuts across the federal budget, which would pay for between 2,500 and 6,200 miles of new four-lane highways, 2,200 miles of six-lane interstate highways, or resurface 20,000 miles of existing four-lane roads.

In September 2014, AFSA\u2019s journal noted Holmes served in Afghanistan 2007-2008, India 2008-2010, and as special assistant for South and Central Asia to then Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Bill Burns in 2011 and 2012. The Foreign Service Journal reported: Through this experience Holmes came to believe that the division of authority between the Office of Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan and the Bureau of Central and South Asian Affairs \u201chindered our diplomatic effectiveness an deprived policy makers of coordinated strategic advice.\u201d For speaking out on this issue Holmes received the 2014 William R. Rivkin Award for constructive dissent by a mid-level FSO [Foreign Service Officer]. The article includes a photo of Holmes meeting with President Barack Obama in the White House and another photo of Holmes holding his award. (The Foreign Service Journal) (The Foreign Service Journal) In September 2014 the AFSA website published a story about staffers who had won dissent awards, including Holmes: This year was the first since 2006 that AFSA has presented all four dissent awards (they are conferred only when a fitting recipient is identified). This year, too, the number of deserving nominations received for exemplary performance awards surpassed that of previous years. \u201cIn the non-business- as-usual approach of the office of the SRAP,\u201d his award nomination states, \u201cDavid Holmes was both a dedicated team player in shaping our policies, as well as a courageous advocate for doing so in a more coordinated and strategic way.\u201d (AFSA) Holmes was featured in a photo in another meeting in the White House with Obama in a bizarre story in the New York Post about White House lawyer Avril Haines, who Obama had named as the deputy director of the CIA. (Official White House photo/Pete Souza) The Post story explained how before her work in the Obama administration Haines operated a bookstore in Baltimore, where she held erotica readings. AFSA also used a photo of Holmes seated with Obama on Air Force One on the cover of its journal in September 2014 on the dissent winners: (The Foreign Service Journal) National Public Radio (NPR) wrote about Holmes and his reputation at the State Department: \u201cHis message was so good and so influential that it went all the way to the secretary of state,\u201d said Eric Rubin, an active duty foreign service officer and president of the American Foreign Service Association. Rubin, who also received the award in 1994, made clear it is not about whistleblowers, but rather recognizing someone who feels strongly enough to put themselves on record for voicing views on policy that may differ from the administration. In his testimony before the House Intelligence Committee\u2019s impeachment hearing on Thursday, Holmes was critical of Trump\u2019s approach to foreign policy that includes involving people who are not part of the \u201cinteragency\u201d chain of command.

      "content": " Rep. Jim Himes (D-CT) began his questioning of Hill by repeating her earlier testimony that the idea that Ukraine interfered in the election is a \u201cfictional narrative.\u201d \u201cI brought with me two exhibits that I was pointed to by your colleagues during the deposition that I gave on Oct. 14,\u201d Hill said. \u201cI\u2019m grateful they pointed me in this direction.\u201d One of those \u201cexhibits\u201d was an op-ed written by then-Ukrainian Ambassador to the United States Valeriy Chaly and published in The Hill newspaper. \u201cSo this is during the presidential campaign when President Trump was then the nominee for the Republican Party,\u201d Hill said, adding the Chaly was \u201ccritical of President Trump.\u201d Himes tried to justify that criticism by saying the Trump had made negative comments about Crimea. \u201cTo be honest the whole article is actually about Ukraine and this is a classic standard for anyone who wants to write an op-ed,\u201d Hill said. \u201cI\u2019ve written plenty myself \u2014 you pick a peg and proceed to say what you want to say.\u201d Himes continued to criticize Trump and then asked if Hill thought the editorial represented interfering with the election as Trump has claimed. \u201cI would say that it\u2019s probably not the most advisable thing to do for an ambassador because you never know who\u2019s going to win,\u201d Hill said. Hill then cited the second article she was shown, one written by journalist Kenneth Vogel in 2017. \u201cMr. Vogel points out that the Ukrainian government, again, you know, they wouldn\u2019t have done very well at the bookies picking up the issue I pointed out in the beginning of today,\u201d Hill said. \u201cThey bet on the wrong horse.\u201d \u201cThey bet on Hillary Clinton winning the election,\u201d Hill said. \u201cAnd so, you know, they were trying to curry favor with the Clinton campaign.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s quite evident here,\u201d Hill claimed, adding that even though Ukraine did make an effort to get information about the Trump campaign, including about former campaign manager Paul Manafort, it didn\u2019t represent a \u201ctop-down effort\u201d such as was the case in Russian election meddling. \u201cI also mentioned in my deposit of October 14th that, in fact, many officials from many countries, including Ukraine, bet on the wrong horse,\u201d Hill said. \u201cThey believed that Secretary Clinton, former Senator Clinton, former first lady Clinton, was going to win and many said some pretty disparaging and hurtful things about President Trump.\u201d \u201cAnd I can\u2019t blame him for feeling aggrieved about them,\u201d Hill said, adding that she would \u201ctake offense at some of the things that were said if I was the president.\u201d Follow Penny Starr on Twitter",

In September, Clinton blamed a long list of things for her loss to President Trump, complaining about the electoral college, Russia hacking, fake news, the media, propaganda, voter suppression, and racist and white supremacist websites. Hill also agreed with Conaway about Putin pushing anti-fracking propaganda on RT, the Russia propaganda media outlet in the United States. She recalled that she attended a meeting with Putin and other Americans in 2011, where the Russian president was adamant about the dangers of fracking while speaking. \u201cHe started in 2011 making it very clear that he saw American fracking as a great threat to Russian interests, we were all struck at how much he stressed this issue,\u201d she said.",

      "author": "Haris Alic",
      "content": " The former vice president, who has a history of refusing to discuss issues realting to his family, was asked by a reporter from Fox News to comment on court documents released Wednesday in an Arkansas paternity case lodged against Hunter Biden. The documents, which included a DNA test, indicated the younger Biden was the biological father of a child born in August 2018 to Lunden Alexis Roberts, a native of Batesville, Arkansas. Roberts, who claims to have been in a relationship with Hunter Biden, filed the suit in May, requesting paternity and child support. Hunter Biden, for his part, has denied fathering the child since the suit became became public. Despite the situation playing publicly, the former vice president was unwilling to acknowledge his newest grandchild on Thursday. \u201cNo. That\u2019s a private matter,\u201d Biden snapped at Peter Doocey, a reporter for Fox News, when asked to comment. The former vice president then proceeded to mock Doocey for even broaching the subject. \u201cBut only you would ask that, you\u2019re a good man. You\u2019re a good man. Classy,\u201d Biden said testily, in video captured by the Washington Examiner.  The paternity suit is only the latest headache Hunter Biden has caused his father\u2019s presidential campaign. Initially, the younger Biden was supposed to play a key role in the campaign, but such plans were\u00a0squashed\u00a0after Breitbart News\u00a0reported\u00a0on a 2016 incident in which a cocaine pipe was found in a car he rented in Arizona. News of the incident was enough to scuttle a planned appearance by Hunter Biden at his father\u2019s campaign launch in late April. Since then, every time the younger Biden\u2019s name has appeared in the news, it has been associated with controversy. Most notably, Hunter Biden has found himself the\u00a0center of the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry after President Donald Trump suggested the Ukrainian government look into his business dealings in the country.",

      "author": "Sean Moran",
      "content": " Rose \u2014 a freshman Democrat who represents Staten Island and parts of Brooklyn, New York \u2014 told CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett he decided to back an impeachment inquiry into President Trump after it became clear the Trump administration was going to obstruct any investigation into the president\u2019s call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Rose said: Immediately when this Ukraine scandal hit, right out the door I said that this is alarming, a potential national security issue, something that we have to get to the bottom of, and all options are on the table. Over the course of several days thereafter, it became clear that this administration was going to practice pure and unadulterated obstruction and deflection and lying in the process, and it was at that point that I did make the decision to support this impeachment inquiry. Democrat Rose was one of the last Democrats to back an impeachment inquiry into President Trump. Congressman Rose represents one of the 13 House districts that Democrats flipped during the 2018 midterm election, and President Trump won during the 2016 presidential election by more than six percent. Rose\u2019s 11th congressional district represents one of the key districts that Republicans hope to take back during the 2020 congressional elections. \u201cWe do quid pro quos all the time, but we do them to advance the interest of the American people, not the interest of any individual,\u201d he contended. Rep. Rose disputed the idea his district is a Trump district. \u201cMy district is not a Donald Trump district, just like my district is not a Max Rose district. What it is, is \u2014 it\u2019s a patriotic district,\u201d Rose said. Congressman Rose has also made inflammatory comments in the past regarding his support for impeachment. In an inverted sense of the American justice system, Rep. Rose said in October that President Trump should \u201cprove\u201d innocence regarding the impeachment charges Democrats have levied against him. \u201cI do not want to be here. This is the last thing I want to be doing,\u201d Rose said.\u00a0\u201cBut no one is to blame but the president. The president says he is innocent, so all we are saying is \u2018prove it.\u2019 But that is not what they are doing.

The use of Hamilton\u2019s quote was a suggestion that Trump may be deliberately seeking to inflict chaos on the country by repeatedly trying to embarrass the General Government while scoffing at the principles of liberty. The quote is as follows: When a man unprincipled in private life, desperate in his fortune, bold in his temper . . . despotic in his ordinary demeanour \u2014 known to have scoffed in private at the principles of liberty \u2014 when such a man is seen to mount the hobby horse of popularity \u2014 to join in the cry of danger to liberty \u2014 to take every opportunity of embarrassing the General Government & bringing it under suspicion \u2014 to flatter and fall in with all the non sense of the zealots of the day \u2014 It may justly be suspected that his object is to throw things into confusion that he may \u2018ride the storm and direct the whirlwind.\u2019 Alexander Hamilton (Special thanks to Ron Chernow) Of course this is not the first time that 67-year-old\u00a0producer\u00a0has used his vanity cards to attack Donald Trump. Last October, Lorre used the credits of\u00a0Big Bang Theory\u00a0to attack Trump as\u00a0\u201ca fascist, hate-filled, fear-mongering, demagogic, truth-shattering, autocratic golf cheater,\u201d while appealing to God to reduce Republican voter turnout.\u00a0In January, Lorre used the credits of the same show to convey a similar message, describing Trump as America\u2019s \u201cGangster-in-Chief.\u201d Lorre, who is also known for producing other hit TV shows such as\u00a0Two and a Half Men\u00a0and Grace Under Fire, has\u00a0also previously suggested that Trump suffers a mental condition caused by brain damage at birth and that he had contracted the sexually transmitted disease syphilis.

Hundreds of protesters occupied Polytechnic University this week in Hong Kong, fighting off\u00a0a police siege with improvised weapons. Trump said he would like to see President Xi and the protesters work out a deal as he continued negotiating with them on a trade agreement. \u201cI stand with Hong Kong, and I stand with freedom,\u201d he continued. Trump said he remained insistent that President Xi and China not take lethal action against the protesters in Hong Kong. \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for me, thousands of people would have been killed in Hong Kong, and we wouldn\u2019t have any riots; you would have a police state,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only reason he\u2019s not going in is because I\u2019m saying it will affect our trade deal, and he doesn\u2019t want to do that.\u201d",

Even though the fan club has only a few members, Umbs said he wanted to do something positive for President Trump. He commented: I thought it would be kind of a neat idea to do something kind of in support because all of this publicity that we see is always negative, negative, negative. And I wanted to show that there are people out there who are supportive of the president who are doing good and good for the community. Twice this year, Umbs and his girlfriend, who is also a member of the fan club, have picked up trash along the highways where the signs stand, bearing the president\u2019s name. Umbs told\u00a0the Washingtonian that he enjoyed tidying up the two-and-a-half-mile stretch of roads, even though \u201cit\u2019s a pretty liberal area.\u201d \u201cNo matter what side of the aisle people are on they thank us, they roll down the window and give us a thumbs up, honk their horn,\u201d he said. When asked what he will do if Trump does not win a second term, Umbs stated, \u201cThat is a really good question! I guess I would just keep cleaning it up. I think the permits are good for three years.\u00a0I don\u2019t think my support\u2019s going to change.\u201d In 2016, Fairfax County gave President Trump just a little more than 28 percent of the vote, whereas Hillary Clinton got 64 percent, according to Fox News. However, that fact has not caused the young man to question his support for the president. \u201cI really like President Trump,\u201d Umbs said. \u201cI really feel like he follows through with what he says, and number one that he absolutely loves the country \u2026 and if I have to clean up trash to show my support, I\u2019m willing to do that.\u201d",

It\u2019s a much different time than when I was in Congress, and I was there for 18 years, a long time. We\u2019ve just become more tribal. You know, back in the days when I was there, and it was not when we were using candles to light the room, it wasn\u2019t that long ago, actually, you know, the situation was you always had outliers in our party. Always there were three or four or five that would go their own way. Sometimes I might even be one of those people at times, but you don\u2019t see much of that now. It\u2019s odd to me. Because if you put a lot of people on an island, there\u2019s always somebody who is an outlier. Right now we\u2019re not seeing an outlier, and it seems as though a party affiliation, a party loyalty means more than anything else, but constituents can disrupt that and people\u2019s consciences can disrupt that. We just have to wait and see.\u201d He continued, \u201cWe\u2019ve become so tribal. At some point, people will say I\u2019ve got to be my own person. I can\u2019t tell you when\u00a0it would happen, but I think at some point it will.\u201d He added, \u201cIt\u2019s sort of like a football game. you watch Alabama and LSU, some are on one side, others on the other.

      "author": "Joshua Caplan",
      "content": " \u201cThere\u2019s an interesting aspect to that call, leave out the irony that this president ran against Hillary Clinton for using an insecure email server,\u201d Weissmann, known as Mueller\u2019s \u201cpit bull,\u201d began. \u201cHere you have a call on a cellphone, lots of discussions about sending emails and texts, but this is one where you\u2019ve heard from everyone who is in Ukraine who knows\u2013you worry about everything being tapped,\u201d he said of the Trump-Sondland call. Weissmann then possed the question: \u201cYou know that call is going to be monitored by the Russians\u2026 Do you care about the Russians having it?\u201d \u201cWhy weren\u2019t the president and Ambassador Sondland worried about the fact that the Russians would undoubtedly in Ukraine be able to hear this conversation?\u201d he then asked. Weissmann\u2019s pair of questions prompted MSNBC anchor Nicole Wallace to ask under what circumstances would the president be comfortable about the call\u2019s possible interception by the Kremlin. \u201cIf your thinking is \u2018I don\u2019t care because the Russians will be siding with me in the 2020 election,\u2019 then you\u2019re all on the same team,\u201d the former Mueller prosecutor\u00a0hypothesized. Critics point to President Trump\u2019s July 26 call with Sondland as evidence implicating the president in a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d scheme to exchange U.S. military aid to Ukraine for an investigation into allegations of corruption against former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden. A CIA analyst\u2019s mischaracterization of President Trump\u2019s call with\u00a0\u00a0Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25 is the subject of a \u201cwhistleblower\u201d complaint, which sparked House Democrats to launch an impeachment inquiry. Testifying before the House Intelligence Committee on Wednesday, Sondland said it was likely he told the president that Zelensky \u201cloves your ass\u201d and stands ready to work together on a host of issues. On Thursday, State Department official David Holmes testified that he overheard President Trump asking Sondland, \u201cSo, he\u2019s gonna do the investigation?\u201d a reference to Zelensky launching a probe into the Bidens. Holmes said\u00a0Sondland replied, \u201cHe\u2019s gonna do it,\u201d and told the president that Ukraine\u2019s president would do \u201canything you ask him to.\u201d President Trump and Zelensky have both vehemently denied any pressure was applied to probe the Bidens and the White House has released two transcripts of the world leaders\u2019 calls as evidence that no wrongdoing occurred.",

Congressman Van Drew explained during a two-hour teleconference call with constituents Thursday night that although he remains concerned about the White House\u2019s actions, he believes that impeachment may fracture the nation. The New Jersey Democrat said, \u201cMy thoughts are certainly we have concerns about some of the activities that have taken place in the White House. I understand how people are so concerned about it. I\u2019m also concerned, but also about we are tearing the country apart.\u201d Rep. Van Drew represents\u00a0one of the 18 congressional districts that flipped blue during the 2018 midterm elections and President Trump won during the 2016 presidential election. Rep. Van Drew said most of Democrats\u2019 efforts have focused on impeachment rather than helping Americans. The New Jersey Democrat said he has yet to see any impeachable crimes coming from the White House. \u201cWe are a country where we can love each other, take care of each other and move forward and do good. There are so many issues we need to take care of,\u201d Van Drew asserted. Van Drew stated that he does not believe that the Senate will convict President Trump. Rep. Van Drew also said, \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen here he is gong [sic] to be impeached (in the House) and in the Senate I personally \u2026 do not even think there is a chance he is going to be convicted. In fact no one has ever been convicted.\u201d The New Jersey representative said he remains an independent voice in the Democrat party. \u201cI don\u2019t think anything would bother you about my voting record at all,\u201d Van Drew said. \u201cWhen I run, I will have Republicans beat me up pretty fierce. They know that I am still a Democrat. A blue dog, a person who stands up and says what he believes. Sometimes not going along with the party\u2026 but that\u2019s okay.\u201d In contrast to Rep. Van Drew, Congressman Max Rose (D-NY) said\u00a0Friday that he backed the impeachment of President Trump after it was \u201cclear\u201d the Trump administration would obstruct and lie to prevent any Democrat investigation into Trump\u2019s conversations with Ukrainian leaders.

It was taken\u00a0November 12-18 among 797 registered voters in New York state, and asked, \u201cTurning now to Washington, based on everything you know right now, do you support or oppose Congress impeaching President Trump and removing him from office?\u201d According to the survey, 59 percent of independent voters oppose impeachment, and only 37 percent support it. The results along party lines are fairly predictable, with 78 percent of Democrats supporting impeachment and 81 percent of Republicans opposing. Overall, the survey found 52 percent supporting the effort and 44 percent opposing it. Nonetheless, the survey signals a significant shift among independents, particularly. Polls, released in recent days, have shown a shift in public sentiment. A\u00a0National Emerson College poll released on Thursday\u00a0showed\u00a0opposition to impeachment growing and support falling. Once again, the shift was the most dramatic among independent voters. As Breitbart News reported: \u201cSupport for impeachment has flipped since October from 48% support with 44% opposing to now 45% opposed and 43% in support,\u201d Emerson found. The greatest shift in opinion occurred among independent voters, who now\u00a0oppose impeachment 49 percent to 34 percent. Last month, independents supported impeachment 48 percent to 39 percent. A\u00a0Politico-Morning Consult poll\u00a0released\u00a0this week showed similar results, with 47 percent of independents opposing impeachment\u00a0 \u2013 a ten-point increase in one week \u2013 and 40 percent supporting it, down from 47 percent. The Siena College Research Institute poll also asked, \u201cHow best would you describe the impeachment inquiry being led by Democrats in the House of Representatives?\u201d Fifty-one percent of independents described it as a \u201cpartisan attack on President Trump,\u201d while 43 percent said it is a \u201cfair investigation.\u201d Respondents were also asked, \u201cWho do you trust more to tell the American people the truth?\u201d Trump took a slight edge among independents, with 37 choosing him and 36 percent choosing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA). The margin of error is +/- 4 percent, making the independent voters\u2019 opposition to impeachment outside of statistical uncertainty.",

I want no quid pro quo.\u201d Sondland said: I finally called the president \u2026 I believe I just asked him an open-ended question, Mr. Chairman. What do you want from Ukraine?

Jim Jordan (R-OH) emphasized that point during the hearing: On page 14 you said this: Was there a quid pro quo \u2013 today\u2019s, your opening statement \u2013 as I testified previously with regard to requested White House call, White House meeting is yes that there needed to be a public statement from President Zelensky. When the chairman asked you about the security assistance dollars you said there needed to be a public announcement from Zelensky, so I\u2019m asking you a simple question. When did that happen? \u201cIt never did,\u201d Sondland said. \u201cThey got the call July 25. The got the meeting \u2013 not in the White House but in New York \u2013 on September 25. They got the money on September 11,\u201d Jordan continued: I mean, you got all three of them wrong. They get the call, they get the meeting, they get the money. It\u2019s not 2+2. It\u2019s 0-3. I mean I\u2019ve never seen anything like this. And you told Mr. Castor that the president never told you that the announcement had to happen to get anything. In fact. He didn\u2019t just not tell you that, he explicitly said the opposite. The gentlemen from Texas just read it. You said to the President of the United States, \u201cWhat do you want from Ukraine?\u201d The President: \u201cI want nothing. I want no quid pro quo. I want Zelenksy to do the right thing. I want him to so what he ran on. This is far from the first time Clinton has remarked on the impeachment inquiry\u2019s developments. Last week, she accused Trump of engaging in \u201cwitness intimidation\u201d after the president tweeted about\u00a0former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch during her testimony \u2013 something she would not have known if House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) refrained from reading the tweets aloud during the hearing:  On Wednesday, Clinton praised the individuals who worked to win a House majority for Democrats, because that ultimately made the impeachment hearings possible:  White House Principal Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley told Fox News\u2019s The Story on Thursday that, even though the president does not believe the House has a basis to move forward with impeachment, he would invite a trial in the Senate in hopes of calling witnesses such as Schiff, the so-called \u201cwhistleblower,\u201d and the Bidens. \u201cAnd he says, if the House moves forward with this sham, and they continue to push these fake, illegitimate proceedings onto the American people, then he wants it to go to the Senate, and he wants a trial,\u201d Gidley said.",

      "content": " Rep. Mike Conaway (R-TX) was questioning Hill during the hearing and asked her about the Russian-backed Russian TV or RT and its influence in the United States. \u201cSo the RT, Putin\u2019s \u2013 would you agree with me RT is Putin\u2019s propaganda machine in the United States?\u201d Conaway asked. \u201cI would agree with you, yes,\u201d Hill said. \u201cIs it appropriate for RT to be used to affect public policy in our nation?\u201d Conaway said. \u201cFor example, a long series of advertisements or programs on RT going against fracturing, saying it was bad and trying to affect public policy in the United States.\u201d \u201cShould Americans be paying attention to that?\u201d Conaway asked. \u201cIn the sense that Americans should be paying attention to RT and other outlets used to propagate this information, absolutely,\u201d Hill said. \u201cFracking is a controversial issue in our nation,\u201d Conaway said. \u201cIf we did away with fracking, the United States wouldn\u2019t be in a position today to dominate oil production in the world and play into strengthening Putin\u2019s hand.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s correct,\u201d Hill said. \u201cI\u2019d like to point out, in November 2011, I sat next to Vladimir Putin at a conference in which he made that precise point.\u201d \u201cIt was the first time he had done so to a group of American journalists and experts who were brought to something called the Discussion Club,\u201d Hill said. \u201c[Putin] started in 2011 making it clear that he saw American fracking as a great threat to Russian interests.\u201d \u201cWe were all struck by how much he stressed this issue,\u201d Hill said. Investors Business Daily reported in November 2018 about the fracking revolution in the United States: The river of oil now hitting the market from U.S. fracking has stunned global energy markets. The U.S. has already leapfrogged both Russia and Saudi Arabia as the No. 1 producer. For the first time since World War II, the U.S.\u00a0is on the verge of being a net oil exporter\u00a0\u2014 something that, just five years ago, would have been considered impossible. This, of course, has caught the 28-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries by surprise. Even just a few years ago, the consensus was that fracking and its related technologies would add a decent amount of oil to the market, but nothing like what\u2019s happening now. As Javier Blas of Bloomberg notes, U.S. oil output is rising at its fastest pace in 98 years. Meanwhile, both Russia and the Saudis are also pumping at record levels. The U.S. is tipping the scale. Since 2010 in the West Texas Permian Oil Basin alone, some 114,000 new wells have been drilled, bringing millions of barrels of new oil to the market. Other parts of the U.S. are undergoing the same transformation. The hearing marked the end of two weeks of testimony from mostly the diplomatic wing of the federal government, including David Holmes, an aide to the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, who sat next to Hill at the witness table.

      "content": " Speaking at a campaign town hall in Greenwood, South Carolina, the former vice president was confronted by activists from a radical immigrant rights group called Movimiento Cosecha. Initially, a member of the group told Biden it was difficult as an immigrant to trust him because of\u00a0his defense of the three million deportations that occurred under President Barack Obama\u2019s tenure in office. The activist, who addressed Biden in Spanish through a translator, asked the former vice president if he would commit to ending such deportations through executive action on his first day in office. \u201cNo, I will not stop all deportations,\u201d Biden responded. \u201cI will prioritize deportations, only people who have committed a felony or a serious crime.\u201d The answer seemed not to please the Carlos Rojas, the activist who was translating for the initial questioner. Rojas, who claimed to have been a volunteer for Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign, began lecturing Biden about the deportations that occurred during his service in the vice presidency. Biden, for his part, seemed unwilling to indulge the activist. \u201cYou should vote for Trump,\u201d the former vice president cut off Rojas mid-sentence as the activist was laying out the Obama administration\u2019s record on immigration.\u201dYou should vote for Trump,\u201d Biden repeated mockingly. \u201cNo, I am not going to do that,\u201d Rojas responded, before demanding Biden pledge to end all deportations if elected in president. \u201cWe want to hear you say that.\u201d The former vice president tried to double down on his promise to not stop deportations for those that commit felonies, but was met with shouts of \u201cnot one more deportation\u201d by the crowd.  After the confrontation Movimiento Cosecha, issued a statement denouncing the former vice president\u2019s refusal to support a \u201cfull moratorium\u201d on deportations. \u201cBy now, it is clear that the immigrant community cannot trust Biden,\u201d Rojas said in the statement. \u201cWe won\u2019t accept empty promises of immigration reform, while our families are torn apart. We cannot allow history to repeat itself.\u201d This is not the first time that Biden has faced trouble over his immigration position on the campaign trail. In July, one day after his campaign headquarters was stormed by open borders protesters, the former vice president was confronted by an immigration activist in New Hampshire. The activist, who claimed to be undergoing deportation proceedings, demanded that Biden \u201capologize to the three million immigrants that were deported and separated from their families under the Obama years.\u201d The former vice president simply smirked\u00a0at the cameras taping the altercation, before telling the activist he would do no such thing. \u201cI will not apologize for the deportation of people who have committed a felony,\u201d Biden said at the time.",

According to the survey, however, 59 percent of likely U.S. voters fear it is Trump\u2019s foes who will resort to violence, including 34 percent who are \u201cvery concerned.\u201d \u201cThese findings are unchanged from June of last year,\u201d noted Rasmussen. The poll found 53 percent of likely voters are concerned, including 24 percent who are \u201cvery concerned,\u201d that violence will occur if Democrats succeed in removing Trump from office. As was the case last year, 31 percent of likely voters fear the United States will experience a second civil war within the next five years, including 41 percent of those voters under the age of 40.

Rasmussen observed Democrats fear violence more from Trump\u2019s foes: But Democrats aren\u2019t nearly as worried about Trump\u2019s supporters which helps explain their strong support for the highly partisan impeachment effort. While 40% of Democrats are Very Concerned that those opposed to Trump\u2019s policies will resort to violence, just 18% feel that way about his supporters if the president is removed from office. The telephone and online survey included the views of 1,000 likely voters and was conducted November 18-19.

The Chronicle characterizes farmers as \u201cbig water users allied with Washington.\u201d Newsom said in a statement: We are once again marshaling our collective resources and building on our record of strong, science-based environmental policies, to chart a new path forward for water policy in California. As stewards of this state\u2019s remarkable natural resources, we must do everything in our power to protect them. \u201cThe next generation of Californians deserve nothing less,\u201d Newsom said. The Chronicle reports that 30 percent of the state\u2019s water supply to cities and farms comes from federal and state-run water reservoirs. The Trump administration last month announced new rules for both water sources to lessen restrictions on giving farms access to the water supplies. The Chronicle reported: The administration\u2019s changes were cheered by farmers in the San Joaquin Valley who have blamed long-standing environmental regulation for tying up water to the state\u2019s $54 billion agricultural economy. Environmental groups, however, blasted the rules. They said additional water releases would dry up the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta and the rivers that feed it, jolting a statewide ecosystem that supports not only fish but birds, bears, killer whales and other plants and animals. \u201cThe federal plan is really a plan for extinction,\u201d Doug Obegi, a senior attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said in the Chronicle report. \u201cI\u2019m glad to see the state stand up to the Trump administration. This is a big deal.\u201d But the Trump administration defended its move. \u201cFrom the beginning, we\u2019ve been focused on cooperative solutions with the state of California to being reliable water supplies to farms, families, communities and the environment,\u201d Brenda Burman, commissioner of the Bureau of Reclamation, said in a statement, adding: Today\u2019s announcement by Gov. Newsom is disappointing in his preference to have judges dictate these important projects instead of the career professionals at the federal and state levels who have developed a plan baed on the best science and significant input from the public. \u201cIf that\u2019s their choice, we\u2019ll see them in court,\u201d Burman said.

Romney noted that flavors like \u201cunicorn poop\u201d were branded that way to appeal to children. \u201cUtah is a Mormon state, and half the kids in high school are vaping,\u2019 he warned. Romney cited Juul\u2019s decision to voluntarily end flavors because of the dangers to children, but some of the executives present argued that most of their sales were flavored juices. The president, who has clearly been listening to vaping advocates in recent weeks, warned that prohibition could only force people to seek out vaping juices off the street. \u201cThey could be selling something on a street corner that could be horrible\u2026 they are going to have a flavor that is poison,\u201d he said.",

      "subtitle": "Conservatives across the Georgia Republican base have sounded the alarm over Gov. Brian Kemp\u2019s potential appointment of Kelly Loeffler as an interim Republican senator. Georgia conservative activist Debbie Dooley called her a \u201ccountry club Republican\u201d in an interview with Breitbart News.",
      "author": "Sean Moran",
      "content": " As Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-GA) is set to retire shortly, Gov. Kemp has two potential options to nominate as an interim Georgia Republican senator: Rep. Doug Collins (R-GA) and financial executive Kelly Loeffler. Collins is the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee and has served as a staunch supporter of President Trump during the impeachment inquiry and of the president\u2019s agenda. Loeffler is the CEO of Bakkt, a bitcoin trading and a storage platform that is owned by the Atlanta-based Intercontinental Exchange (ICE). President Donald Trump has reportedly pressured Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp to appoint Doug Collins as the interim senator. White House senior advisers Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner also support Collins\u2019 temporary appointment to the U.S. Senate. Even though the White House strongly supports Collins\u2019 appointment, a Georgia-based political strategist said Collins is not one of the governor\u2019s top choices for the seat. Debbie Dooley, a Tea Party movement co-founder and a Georgia conservative activist, told Breitbart News in an interview Friday that Collins will both defend Trump during the impeachment proceedings as well as advance Trump\u2019s America First agenda. Dooley said, \u201cDoug Collins is the perfect candidate for the job. He is a conservative, with a strong conservative voting record, he has nation-wide name recognition, he is one of Donald Trump\u2019s staunchest supporters, he\u2019s articulate, he can raise a ton of money\u2026he is the logical choice.\u201d Other conservatives have called for Kemp to back Collins for the Senate seat. Donald Trump Jr., President Trump\u2019s son, hosted a fundraiser for Collins in late October and said in November that Collins \u201cis a fighter and exactly the kind of person Republicans should want in the senate. We need someone who gets it, not someone who will have to learn on the job.\u201d   American Conservative Union (ACU) Chairman Matt Schlapp wrote a letter to Kemp in October, urging him to pick the Georgia conservative congressman for the seat. He said that Collins has been a \u201cstrong advocate\u201d in Congress and has stood up against the \u201cphony [impeachment] attacks leveled at a duly elected President.\u201d Dooley said in contrast to Collins, Loeffler is a \u201ccountry club Republican\u201d with concerning ties to Planned Parenthood, Stacey Abrams, and has donated to Republicans such as Sen. Mitt Romney and former Speaker Paul Ryan, who have been sharply critical of Trump. She added that \u201cconservatives overwhelmingly would much rather have Doug Collins than a Romney-RINO Republican\u201d such as Loeffler. Dooley said that Loeffler has a history of donating to establishment Republicans such as Mitt Romney, while she has only very recently donated to Donald Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign. Dooley said Loeffler \u201cgave $750,000 to Mitt Romney in 2012; she gave zero to Donald Trump in 2016. A few weeks ago, she gave $100,000 in contributions to Donald Trump, but that was only because her political consultants said, \u2018you need to do this.'\u201d Loeffler donated $750,000 during the 2012 presidential election to Romney super PAC Restore Our Future. The financial executive has also donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to former Speaker Ryan\u2019s political campaigns and PACs. Now, when the question of her potential Senate appointment has come to media attention, Loeffler donated $100,000 to Trump Victory, a joint fundraising committee that is raising funds for the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee (RNC). Dooley said that she has reservations about Loeffler\u2019s ties to Planned Parenthood as well as to Democrat icon Stacey Abrams. Loeffler is the co-owner and co-chairman of the Women\u2019s National Basketball Association (WNBA) Atlanta Dream. After the Trump administration announced plans in 2018 to cut family planning funding from abortion providers such as Planned Parenthood, WNBA President Lisa Borders said that she and the league \u201cstands with Planned Parenthood.\u201d  Borders\u2019 statement follows shortly after the WNBA announced its \u201cTake a Seat, Take a Stand\u201d program, which provides donations to one of six organizations, including Planned Parenthood, for every WNBA ticket purchased. Loeffler\u2019s team also promoted the program, which favors donations to the abortion provider Planned Parenthood. The potential Senate Republican nominee also has strong ties to former Democrat gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams. In August, Abrams joined the WNBA players\u2019 union.  Abrams also played a role in bringing the Atlanta Dream back to the city in 2008, with help from WNBA President Borders. Abrams\u2019 consulting firm, Sage Works, has worked with the Atlanta Dream. Further, Loeffler\u2019s team, the Atlanta Dream, named Abrams as an \u201caspiring woman\u201d in 2014. \u201cStacey Abrams is an integral part of\u201d Loeffler\u2019s basketball \u201cteam,\u201d Dooley contended. Loeffler\u2019s Atlanta Dream has also pushed back on some socially conservative policies in Georgia. In 2016, The Atlanta Dream was one of more than 100 businesses and universities that opposed state Sen. Josh McKoon\u2019s (R-GA) Religious Freedom Restoration Act that would protect companies\u2019 and Americans\u2019 religious freedom. As Gov. Kemp continues to consider whether to appoint a more establishment-minded Republican such as Loeffler or a more conservative option like Collins, Dooley has charged that picking Loeffler would \u201calienate\u201d Georgia\u2019s conservative base. Further, Dooley said that picking Loeffler would be \u201cturning his back on the base that helped get him elected\u201d if he chose Loeffler. Dooley said this nomination serves as another instance for the \u201csoul\u201d of the Georgia Republican Party, where the state party could move towards Trump\u2019s America First vision or slide back towards the Romney-style conservatism that lost the 2012 presidential election to former President Barack Obama. \u201cThis is a fight for the heart and soul of the Georgia Republican Party,\u201d Dooley said. \u201cAre we going to defend President Trump, his agenda, represent the state well, or are we going to be a party of Mitt Romney Republicans?\u201d Sean Moran is a congressional reporter for Breitbart News.

We have to start this conversation by underscoring the fact that impeachment is not legal, it is political. Its only Constitutional base is treason, bribery, or other hard crimes and misdemeanors.\u201d He contoued, \u201cHere\u2019s what I think the Democrats will want, Nick. Here\u2019s what I think they will advance. One is bribery. The allegation is The technical definition of bribery is the failure to perform an official duty until a thing of value comes your way, and they will argue that the president\u2019s failure to disperse funds that the Congress ordered be dispersed until the recipient of the funds agreed to investigate a potential political opponent is an act of bribery. That is enough, in my opinion, to make it over the threshold of impeachable offenses. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s enough to convict of bribery, but it\u2019s enough to allege it for the purpose of impeachment. The second charge will be high crimes and misdemeanors \u2014 election law violation. The third crime will be obstruction of justice.

      "subtitle": "House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence ranking member Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA) intends to file lawsuits against both CNN and the Daily Beast over fake hit pieces the outlets have published about him in recent days, Breitbart News has learned exclusively.",
      "author": "Matthew Boyle",
      "content": " Two pieces recently published in both outlets\u2013one from Daily Beast earlier this week, and one from CNN published late Friday\u2013alleged that the Rudy Giuliani associate Lev Parnas, who is now indicted on unrelated charges, helped Nunes with a variety of matters when digging into Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election on behalf of Democrats. The Daily Beast story, from Betsy Swan (formerly Woodruff), alleges that Parnas helped Nunes set up a variety of meetings on Ukraine matters. The CNN story, from Vicky Ward, goes even further, alleging that Nunes arranged a secret trip to Vienna and met there with Victor Shokin, the Ukrainian prosecutor that former Vice President Joe Biden pushed to have fired when Shokin was investigating Burisma Holdings, the natural gas company paying Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden $83,000 per month. It is unclear at this time how much of these reports are blatantly false, but most of each of them appear to be inaccurate, according to sources familiar with the matter. As such, Nunes is planning to sue both the Daily Beast and CNN over each story. \u201cThese demonstrably false and scandalous stories published by the Daily Beast and CNN are the perfect example of defamation and reckless disregard for the truth,\u201d Nunes told Breitbart News late Friday night. \u201cSome political operative offered these fake stories to at least five different media outlets before finding someone irresponsible enough to publish them. I look forward to prosecuting these cases, including the media outlets, as well as the sources of their fake stories, to the fullest extent of the law. I intend to hold the Daily Beast and CNN accountable for their actions. They will find themselves in court soon after Thanksgiving.\u201d Nunes has had rocky relationships with both establishment media outlets, and he regularly refuses to work with\u2013or have his office cooperate with\u2013any outlet that engages in deliberate printing of inaccurate and fake information, as CNN and the Daily Beast regularly do. For instance, Nunes in this 2018 video, called CNN\u2019s Manu Raju\u2019s outlet the \u201cleading Democratic Party propaganda\u201d outlet:  CNN refused, then, to publish a Nunes quote about CNN\u2019s engagement in printing inaccurate information:  The CNN piece from Ward interestingly lays out how Nunes refuses to interact with the outlet: Over the past two weeks, CNN approached Nunes on two occasions and reached out to his communications staff to get comment for this story. In the Capitol on Nov. 14, as CNN began to ask a question about the trip to Vienna, Nunes interjected and said, \u201cI don\u2019t talk to you in this lifetime or the next lifetime.\u201d \u201cAt any time,\u201d Nunes added. \u201cOn any question.\u201d Asked again on Thursday about his travel to Vienna and his interactions with Shokin and Parnas, Nunes gave a similar response. \u201cTo be perfectly clear, I don\u2019t acknowledge any questions from you in this lifetime or the next lifetime,\u201d Nunes said while leaving the impeachment hearing. \u201cI don\u2019t acknowledge any question from you ever.\u201d The Daily Beast has similarly had a history of printing inaccurate information about Nunes, according to multiple reports detailing how the outlet has printed false and misleading stories about him. While media outlets like CNN and the Daily Beast are willingly printing this information and these allegations against people like Nunes, fed to them by Parnas\u2019 legal team, it appears to be part of a broader strategy by Parnas and his legal team to try to get out of the trouble he faces. The New York Daily News reported on Parnas attempting to curry favor with authorities in a story Friday morning: One of the Florida businessmen who worked with Rudy Giuliani on his hunt for Ukrainian dirt on Democrats has turned over a trove of \u201chard evidence\u201d to impeachment investigators \u2014 including photos and videos, one of his lawyers said Friday. Lev Parnas, who was criminally charged last month in a sweeping campaign finance scheme that overlaps with the House impeachment inquiry, had so much evidence it had to be sent to House probers in several batches, the attorney, Joseph Bondy, told the Daily News. Bondy said he has also tried to schedule a time for Parnas to testify under oath before the House Intelligence Committee about the \u201cfirst-hand knowledge\u201d he says his client has about President Trump\u2019s bid to pressure Ukraine into investigating Joe Biden\u2019s family and other Democrats before the 2020 election. It remains to be seen what will happen next, and how Nunes\u2019s lawsuit will come together. But Nunes is one of President Donald Trump\u2019s most ardent defenders, and he held the line for the last month plus among Republicans during the Democrats\u2019 \u201cimpeachment inquiry.\u201d The House Intelligence Committee, which is now chaired by Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) since Democrats took the majority in the midterm elections, just held seven total public impeachment hearings over the past two weeks.",

      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " Polls, in recent days, have indicated that the general public is growing weary of House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff\u2019s (D-CA) endless pursuit of impeachment, with survey after survey showing opposition to impeachment growing and support falling. The results, however, are exacerbated when key voters, such as independents, are isolated. A\u00a0Siena College Research Institute poll\u00a0released\u00a0this week showed that independent voters in New York overwhelmingly oppose impeachment, 59 percent to 37 percent. Additionally, 51\u00a0percent of independents described the inquiry as a \u201cpartisan attack on President Trump,\u201d while 43 percent said it is a \u201cfair investigation.\u201d The results coincided with a\u00a0National Emerson College poll and a\u00a0Politico-Morning Consult poll, both of which showed an increase in independent voters\u2019 opposition to impeachment. The overwhelming data led to a Vanity Fair article titled \u201c\u2018It Is Hard to Read This as Anything but a Warning\u2019: New Polling Suggests Democrats\u2019 Impeachment Push Could Alienate Key Voters.\u201d \u201cData exclusive to\u00a0Vanity Fair\u00a0shows impeachment could be a losing issue for Democrats hoping to recruit Independents in 2020. \u2018Lots of people who don\u2019t like Trump who are still prepared to vote for him,\u2019 says one political science expert,\u201d Vanity Fair reported. \u201cIndependents are also one of the keys, if not the key, to the 2020 elections,\u201d the article read, noting the shift in sentiments among those voters in recent weeks: Alas, for the Democrats, the promising numbers of late October and early November rapidly dissipated, and polling numbers have reverted to a level more consistent with long-term opinions on President Trump. In the latest\u00a0Politico/Morning Consult poll, released on November 19, Independents opposed impeachment and removal from office 46% to 39%, a number close to the rolling averages of the last few weeks. It is notable that the poll was fielded\u00a0after\u00a0the\u00a0first public impeachment hearings. Even the\u00a0compelling testimony\u00a0of witnesses like\u00a0Marie Yovanovitch,\u00a0the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, failed to move the needle on public opinion. That doesn\u2019t mean further hearings won\u2019t energize greater opposition to Trump, but it\u2019s a little hard to imagine more effective testimony than that offered by Yovanovitch and some of her Foreign Service colleagues. To understand the relative lack of enthusiasm among Independents for impeachment, I took a close look at data from the most recent Politico/Morning Consult tracking poll, a poll in which the Hive had the opportunity to propose questions focused on Independents and their views. The data, along with supplementary interviews, illustrates an electorate that believes the impeachment inquiry is connected to the priorities of politicians and the media\u2014not of ordinary voters\u2014and an electorate confused and dispirited by the nonstop parade of Washington scandals. Vanity Fair listed three factors that are key to understanding the thinking of independent voters, who will play a significant role in the 2020 election: Per Vanity Fair: Independents see impeachment as a continuation of the partisan bickering and media excess that began even before his inauguration. By massive margins, Independents say that the impeachment issue is \u201cmore important to politicians than it is to me\u201d (62% to 22%) and \u201cmore important to the media than it is to me\u201d (61% to 23%). It is hard to read this as anything but a warning to the Democratic leadership and candidates: Stop talking about issues that matter to you, not to me. Impeachment proceedings are viewed as bread and circuses for the anti-Trump crowd in Washington and the media\u2014or, as Stanford political science professor\u00a0Morris Fiorina\u00a0described it to me, \u201centertainment and confirmation.\u201d That\u2019s a dangerous perception as Democrats approach one of the most consequential and fraught elections of our times. The article marvels over the fact that Trump appears to be going through the impeachment process \u201clargely unscathed\u201d but argues that it should not be attributed, necessarily, to independents and their trust of the president: Most Independents believe, by 39% to 31%, that the president did what the whistle-blower and subsequent witnesses have said he did: withheld military aid to Ukraine until the Ukrainians agreed to announce investigations into his political rivals. And by similar margins, 40% to 35%, Independents believe Trump \u201cabused his power\u201d to affect the 2020 elections.\u201d The outlet added that it is \u201csomewhat remarkable that so many people see an abuse of power, but seem unwilling to hold it against the president in any meaningful way.\u201d The GOP has overwhelmingly declared victory after the two weeks of public impeachment hearings, following the witnesses\u2019 inability to clearly demonstrate an impeachable offense. Ambassador Gordon Sondland\u2019s admission \u2013\u00a0that Trump told him he wanted \u201cnothing\u201d and \u201cno quid pro quo\u201d \u2013\u00a0underscored the Democrats\u2019 lack of a sound basis for the inquiry, Republicans contend. Nonetheless, the public hearings did not bode well for the Democrats from a public opinion standpoint \u2013 a factor they must consider and hurdle they will have to overcome should House Democrats choose to impeach the president.",

      "author": "John Nolte",
      "content": " The headline reads: \u201cPolling Suggests Democrats\u2019 Impeachment Push Could Alienate Key Voters.\u201d The sub-headline reads: \u201cData exclusive to\u00a0Vanity Fair\u00a0shows impeachment could be a losing issue for Democrats hoping to recruit Independents in 2020. \u2018Lots of people who don\u2019t like Trump who are still prepared to vote for him,\u2019 says one political science expert.\u201d And here is the math, and some of it is stunning. We\u2019ll start with my favorite numbers\u2026 By a \u00a0yuge margin of 62 to 22 percent, the all-important Independent voters who will decide the 2020 election, especially in key states, say that impeachment is \u201cmore important to politicians than it is to me.\u201d Get this\u2026 By another yuge margin, 61 to 23 percent, Independents say impeachment is more important to the media than it is to me.\u201d Vanity Fair concludes that these numbers can only mean \u201cImpeachment proceedings are viewed as bread and circuses for the anti-Trump crowd in Washington and the media.\u201d Ya\u2019 think? Another juicy number is that on the list of priorities Independents hold dear, only 27 percent describe impeachment as a top priority, which means it polls well below the deficit (74 percent), health care (72 percent), and infrastructure (70 percent) \u2014 and infrastructure is an issue Trump truly cares about, something he regularly talked about even in the years preceding his presidency. \u00a0Infrastructure is something that could have happened had Nancy Pelosi and the Democrat-run congress not become coup-obsessed, something I expected Trump and the Nervous Nancy to make a deal on. Wait, it gets better\u2026 Hilariously, as Vanity Fair is forced to acknowledge, \u201cEven Trump\u2019s absurd border wall scored as a higher priority for Independents.\u201d \u201cIndependents suffer from scandal fatigue and overall confusion,\u201d Vanity Fair adds. \u201cThey agreed with the statement \u2018[It is] difficult to tell all the investigations in Washington apart\u2019 by a roughly two-to-one margin.\u201d The left-wing publication blames part of this confusion on Trump: \u201cThis no doubt reflects a successful Trump strategy to sow confusion and spread blame. By constantly charging others with acting badly and by creating such a long litany of disputable acts, Trump has in effect led many voters to dismiss the whole mess as the type of bad thing that all politicians do.\u201d How absurd. Democrats and the media (but I repeat myself) have been using hoaxes to investigate Trump for three years now, starting with the failed Russia Collusion Hoax. How are voters supposed to differentiate one hoax from another? \u00a0If it\u2019s not Trump\u2019s taxes, it\u2019s his charity, it\u2019s the emolument hoax, it\u2019s the hoax about Trump saying nice things about Nazis, it\u2019s strippers and Twitter and on and on and on until\u2026 ZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. When everything is a bombshell and everything is white supremacy and everything means the walls are closing in on Drumpf, then it all means nothing. Vanity Fair tries to close on a positive note, but it is an act of kidding one\u2019s self. \u201cThe news isn\u2019t all bad for Democrats. Independents are paying attention to the story at relatively high rates. Viewing numbers for the hearings are high, and in the polling, 50% of Independents say they heard a lot or some about the testimony of Ambassador Yovanovitch.\u201d Actually, this is terrible news for Democrats. It means voters are paying close attention and are still not convinced this impeachment proceeding is anything other just another stupid, partisan exercise performed by a Democrat Party and media (but I repeat myself) who still haven\u2019t come to terms with losing the 2016 election. The truth is this\u2026 The media\u2019s propaganda campaign failed. Badly. All the cable news outlets and all the broadcast networks hoped that airing the impeachment hearings live would give legitimacy to something that was totally illegitimate. On top of that, even as we watched the air go out of the Ukraine Hoax for two weeks as witness after witness admitted they had witnessed nothing, as witness after witness proved there could be no quid pro quo, no bribery, no extortion when Ukraine didn\u2019t know the aid had been put on hold, the fake media still screamed BOMBSHELL every 15 minutes \u2014 but no one was listening. Adam Schiff\u2019s Failure Theater launched with a pathetic 13 million viewers, and over the next two weeks that already humiliating number was cut by more than half. After three years of media hysteria, of BOMBSHELLS that never exploded, the American people know an over-cooked hoax when they see one. What\u2019s more, the American people also know that investigating Joe and Hunter Biden\u2019s looting of Ukraine for millions of dollars is \u201cinvestigating corruption,\u201d and no amount of media spin can decouple the two. When Trump asked Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, he was doing his job. He was looking out for American taxpayers. He was rooting out corruption. Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

      "author": "John Nolte",
      "content": " \u201cDoes anybody know Bob Loves Abishola?\u201d Deutsch asked rhetorically on the basement-rated Morning Joe. \u201cThat\u2019s a show on CBS that had, you know, about five or six million viewers. That\u2019s what these hearings have done,\u201d he lamented. \u201cWe live in a little bit of a bubble that we sit here and we watch. The reality is, when you look at that new Emerson poll where we\u2019ve lost five percent of people who even believe he should be impeached and 14 percent removed from office.\u201d But Deutsch being Deutsch, he has one of his \u201cgenius\u201d ideas to turn this sinking ship around. \u201cSomehow the Democrats need to brand this in a bigger place. Take impeachment and bring it to something that can come back as a kitchen table issue.\u201d \u201cThis is the president of betrayal,\u201d Deutsch suggested as a slogan, adding, \u201c[Trump] betrayed the American trust. He betrayed our national security, he betrayed the Constitution, the presidency, he betrayed us on education. \u2026 He\u2019s going to betray us on health care, he still wants to repeal Obamacare, he\u2019s betrayed you on taxes.\u201d Returning to the reality of his media bubble, Deutsch said, \u201c[Impeachment] needs to go to a bigger place because, unfortunately, come January and February, the parade will move on and we get very hyped up in this building here, we get very hyped up watching.\u201d These morons in the corrupt media actually believed these stupid impeachment hearings would galvanize the nation in the same way Watergate galvanized the nation over the summer of 1973, when tens of millions of Americans tuned in. This is why all three cable networks and all the broadcast networks carried this absurd spectacle live. In worse news for the coup plotters, Adam Schiff\u2019s Failure Theater launched to a paltry 13 million viewers and collapsed to just six million from there. Deutsch is wrong about one thing, though. This wasn\u2019t so much about the media living in a bubble as much as it was a propaganda campaign. The thinking behind all this coverage was two-fold: 1) The all-network coverage was designed to add an air of legitimacy to an illegitimate process, and 2) since the media knew there was no evidence whatsoever that Trump did anything wrong, they hoped to fool the public into believing there was by pretending there was with all this flagrantly dishonest (and amusing) talk about \u201cbombshells.\u201d Equally laughable is the idea Democrats can bounce back with Deutsch\u2019s stupid idea of branding Trump as a betrayer \u2014 you know, because branding him a Nazi-Racist-Russia Spy worked so well. The problem for the coup plotters is that they have absolutely no case against the president. Asking a foreign country to investigate corruption in exchange for U.S. aid is perfectly okay, is a long-held American tradition, and is written into the law. It is not President Trump\u2019s fault that Joe and Hunter Biden decided to loot Ukraine for millions of dollars. It is not President Trump\u2019s fault that his likely 2020 opponent is so audaciously corrupt. The facts are this\u2026 According to the RealClearPolitics poll of polls, Trump\u2019s approval rating is almost exactly where it was prior to the launch of these stupid impeachment hearings \u2014 a relatively healthy 44.3 percent. Meanwhile, support for impeachment is losing ground, especially with the Independent voters who will decide the 2020 election in key states. Finally, are the media and Democrats (but I repeat myself) really stupid enough to impeach and send this to the briar patch of the U.S. Senate, which is almost certain to become a trial of the Deep State and Biden\u2019s corruption? As I\u2019ve said before, If Ukraine didn\u2019t know, there can be no quid pro quo, and all the evidence and testimony points to the fact that Ukraine didn\u2019t know about the pause in aid, that Ukraine had no idea. How can there be a quid pro quo when the quid didn\u2019t know it was supposed to quo? The whole thing is ridiculous, and so are those like Peggy Noonan and Andrew Napolitano who are out there claiming the evidence against Trump is overwhelming. They keep saying that, but they never tell us what the evidence is \u2014 because there is none. Sorry, but third-hand information and bureaucratic self-regard are not evidence.

      "content": " Reuters reported on the November 15 letter sent by Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley and Ron Johnson, chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, to Ken Blanco, the director of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network: The letter, seen by Reuters on Friday, seeks \u201csuspicious activity reports,\u201d or documents that financial institutions file with the department\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network when a case of money laundering or fraud is suspected. It was unclear if any such reports exist regarding Hunter Biden, the former vice president\u2019s son. There letter gave no evidence that Hunter Biden engaged in suspicious activity that would have been covered by such reports. The agency does not comment on the reports, a spokesman said. Fincen, as the network is known, collects more than 2 million such reports each year, and they are tipsheets that make no findings on whether illegal activity has occurred. The letter is part of an effort in Congress to defend President Donald Trump for what Republicans say is a partisan effort by Democrats to make a phone call between Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky where the Bidens\u2019 Ukrainian dealings were discussed an impeachable offense. The lawmakers set a Dec. 5 deadline for Treasury to respond to the request. Reuters noted in its report that Hunter Biden served on the board of directors for Burisima, which has been investigated for corruption. The younger Biden served on the board while Joe Biden was vice president of the United States. \u201cIn the letter, the senators said Burisma was paying Hunter Biden as much as $50,000 a month and their panels were investigating \u2018potentially improper actions by the Obama administration with respect to Burisma Holdings and Ukraine,\u2019\u201d Reuters reported. In the final paragraph of the Reuters report, another investigation is revealed: Grassley and Johnson have asked the U.S. National Archives and Records Administration for records of a 2016\u00a0White House meeting between Obama administration officials, representatives of the Ukrainian government, and officials from the Democratic National Committee.

      "subtitle": "Special Adviser to the President Pam Bondi told Breitbart News that as Americans head home for Thanksgiving dinners with their families, the country needs to know how Democrats have abandoned helping solve Americans\u2019 problems in favor of pursuing an increasingly unpopular impeachment agenda.",
      "author": "Matthew Boyle",
      "content": " In fact, all year, Democrats have failed to help Americans on healthcare, infrastructure, jobs, and security. They have zero legislative accomplishments since taking the House majority but are instead obsessed with impeachment. Bondi said as Americans have Thanksgiving dinner with their families, they should look at the contrast between Democrats, who do nothing for America, and President Donald Trump and Republicans, who are solving Americans\u2019 problems. \u201cThe Democrats have failed to produce any evidence that the president did anything wrong,\u201d Bondi said in an interview on Saturday with Breitbart News. \u201cThey are wasting time, taking awa, as I said, from the issues that Americans care deeply about like USMCA, securing our border, infrastructure, healthcare, tax cuts, things that affect everyday working Americans in this country that are being ignored by Adam Schiff for his dog and pony show, this sham of a proceeding. It\u2019s outrageous, and the American people are seeing through it. Next week is a week to be with your family. It\u2019s Thanksgiving. Look where Vice President Pence and Mrs. Pence are today\u2014they\u2019re in Iraq, they\u2019re with our troops. You\u2019ve seen that. That\u2019s what people need to be looking at, and I hope every network around this country is carrying that and talking about what they\u2019re doing. They\u2019re over there being with the brave men and women who fight for our country every single day.\u201d Bondi\u2019s comments came in an exclusive interview for\u00a0Breitbart News Saturday on SiriusXM 125 the Patriot Channel that aired live on Saturday morning. It comes in the wake of the Democrats wrapping their latest public impeachment hearings this week after five more hearings\u2014two on Tuesday, two on Wednesday, and one on Thursday\u2014all of which, combined with the two the previous week, failed to produce any evidence of any crimes or impeachable offenses by President Donald Trump. \u201cDon\u2019t forget about the secret hearings that they [Democrats] held in the bunker of the Capitol, which were completely absurd\u2014they wouldn\u2019t let Republican lawmakers in the door,\u201d Bondi said. \u201cThey\u2019ve had countless hours of testimony and they\u2019ve run shady closed-door secretive hearings the entire process. Selective leaks, remember that? The entire time these secret hearings were going on and then the testimony they choose to make public is their best of their best\u2014that\u2019s what they choose to make public\u2014and they\u2019ve got nothing. They have zero evidence of wrongdoing by the president and it\u2019s a political circus. Even before President Trump was elected, they have been trying to impeach him. It\u2019s not going to work. This is going to continue for us for the next four years\u2014it\u2019s not going to stop. But we\u2019re going to fight back, we\u2019re going to go on offense, and they have absolutely nothing showing wrongdoing by our great president.\u201d Bondi said that despite the lack of evidence against President Donald Trump, the media and left are continuing to push for impeachment. \u201cThey\u2019ve done this from day one,\u201d Bondi said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to continue to do this. I was walking by seeing a headline on a newspaper when I listened to the testimony, I was listening to everything and I see this headline that was completely contrary to what the witness testified to. Some of these cable shows, they\u2019re flashing up as everything is going on the thing they believe is the most damaging to the president, when in fact that\u2019s not what the witness said. They\u2019re taking selective clips because they\u2019re trying to influence the American people. But you know what we\u2019ve got on our side? The facts and the law. The law did not apply in this case because Adam Schiff ran a complete sham of a hearing, it was outrageous, he had, as you heard, unlimited time and our great Republican lawmakers had very limited time. He cut them off when they were saying things he didn\u2019t want to come out in these hearings. So, I think when\u2014it will, we all know that it\u2019s going to go to the Senate\u2014when it goes to the Senate, that\u2019s when we\u2019re going to hear the real facts. That\u2019s when the witnesses we\u2019ve all heard are going to testify. We\u2019re going to hear the real truth about what happened in this sham. President Trump is having to deal with this every single day along with running the country. Look what he\u2019s doing. But breaking news this morning, USMCA, one of the best trade deals ever and Pelosi just announced most likely now not going to happen until the next year. That\u2019s shameful, shameful for Americans, and shameful for all our workers here in this country. They\u2019re not going to stop doing this to President Trump, but he\u2019s strong, he\u2019s driven, and we have the truth on our side.\u201d Bondi was Attorney General of Florida from January 2011 to January 2019 and has now taken a position in Trump\u2019s White House as Special Adviser to the President, handling impeachment messaging alongside former Treasury Department spokesman Tony Sayegh. Sayegh joined Breitbart News Saturday last weekend after the first hearings, laying out how the White House was confident. Now, Bondi\u2019s interview this Saturday with Breitbart News details how even more confident the White House is now that House Intelligence Committee chairman Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) has blown everything he had and still produced no evidence of impeachable offenses. Bondi, who spent years as a prosecutor before she was first elected as Florida\u2019s Attorney General, told Breitbart News Saturday that she has never seen anything like the way Schiff and Democrats have been running this \u201cimpeachment inquiry\u201d against Trump. \u201cI go back to even before I was attorney general. I was a career prosecutor since I was in my early 20s, starting in misdemeanor court with traffic offenses,\u201d Bondi said. \u201cLet\u2019s take it even one step down: If you got a ticket for allegedly running a stop sign, allegedly rolling through a stop sign and not coming to a complete stop, and you challenged that in court\u2014that\u2019s a civil infraction, it\u2019s not even criminal\u2014you would be afforded more rights than they have given the president of the United States of America. Adam Schiff is a lawyer and he knows this and he knows that the only way he can attempt to take down an American president and overthrow an election is by these sham proceedings. You\u2019re absolutely right\u2014we say due process but that\u2019s what it means. Due process means you have the right, fundamental fairness, you have the right to confront your witnesses against you. You have the right to testify. You have the right to cross-examine witnesses, and hearsay would never be admissible.\u201d Bondi continued by noting that there is no way that a case like this would hold up in court. \u201cSo let\u2019s take this example a step further. So, someone says that you roll through a stop sign and you didn\u2019t do it,\u201d Bondi said. \u201cSomeone thinks you did, your neighbor thinks they saw you do it, so they call the police and say, \u2018Hey, I saw Matt roll through a stop sign.\u2019 Would the police ever charge you with that? Absolutely not. You have to have a direct witness. That\u2019s what they\u2019re doing here, and it\u2019s even worse. It\u2019s hearsay upon hearsay upon hearsay that would never be admissible to any citizen in our country. That\u2019s what they\u2019re trying to do. They\u2019re not going to get away with it, they\u2019re just not.\u201d Bondi added that since the facts are not on the Democrats\u2019 side, and the public can see that.\u00a0The polling is shifting aggressively against impeachment, especially among independent voters. \u201cThe more they go on, the polls are getting better and better for us every single day,\u201d Bondi said. \u201cNancy Pelosi needs to be very, very worried. This runaway train needs to stop. Schiff needs to tread very, very carefully in what he says and does in that final report.\u201d She said that because of this, the 31 Democrats who represent districts that Trump won in 2016 might want to consider breaking with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi when it comes to impeachment\u2014especially since as a party the Democrats have achieved nothing, and they are all in on failure together. \u201cThey need to be very careful because they\u2019re in districts that President Trump won and President Trump will win again,\u201d Bondi said. \u201cThey need to do the right thing. They\u2019re going to be very, very vulnerable in the next election if they don\u2019t. We\u2019re talking about them voting on these articles of impeachment and what they\u2019re going to do\u2014they started off saying their main argument was quid pro quo. What did they do? The Democrats took this, they polled it, they had focus groups come in and say: \u2018What do you think of quid pro quo?\u2019 And what did the American people think? Ridiculous. It\u2019s not going to fly. So then what did they do? They changed the charge to \u2018bribery,\u2019 which doesn\u2019t even apply in this case, it\u2019s so absurd. They changed it to \u2018bribery\u2019 because they think it\u2019s more inflammatory against the president.\u201d Bondi also pointed to a recent Vanity Fair piece that warns Democrats against continuing down the highly unpopular impeachment path, while ignoring Americans\u2019 actual problems. She said that if the Democrats go forward with their impeachment agenda, it will reflect badly on them as a \u201cshameful\u201d chapter in the history books upon their failure to remove Trump from office. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you saw, but Vanity Fair had an article on independents, and independents, what do they have? Scandal-fatigue,\u201d Bondi said. \u201cPeople are over this and they see a political witch hunt and they see a sham that\u2019s been going on day in day out when we could be working on tax cuts, we could be working on USMCA. They could be doing so much good for their constituents in the states where they were elected, yet they\u2019re spending all their time listening, going through hearing after hearing with absolutely nothing there. Going back to being in law school, in constitutional law on what it takes to impeach an American president, this is really shameful for our country and this is going to go down that way for Democrats in the history books, how horrible this is what they\u2019re attempting to do and not going to get away with.\u201d LISTEN TO PAM BONDI FROM THE WHITE HOUSE ON BREITBART NEWS SATURDAY: ",

      "content": " During Friday\u2019s Democratic Weekly Address, Senator Jon Tester (D-MT) stated that the Trump administration has \u201cturned their backs\u201d on veterans by \u201cblocking benefits for those who suffered from illnesses related to the exposure to Agent Orange.\u201d Transcript as Follows: \u201cHi, this is Senator Jon Tester from Montana. And I want to talk about something really important today, that being our veterans. Our nation\u2019s veterans have made many sacrifices for the freedoms that we enjoy. And in return for their service, we have an obligation to ensure that these men and women receive the quality benefits that they have earned. But the Trump Administration\u2014 while claiming to support our veterans, has turned their backs on them, blocking benefits for those who suffered from illnesses related to the exposure to Agent Orange. Agent Orange is a toxic defoliant that was used during the Vietnam War. And it was used in such great volumes, that if you served in Vietnam, you were exposed to it. As a result of these exposures, Vietnam-era Veterans are now experiencing diseases and debilitating health conditions. But the Trump Administration doesn\u2019t see it that way. Instead of doing right by our veterans, they are actively denying these veterans\u2014victims of their service\u2014eligibility for the benefits and care that they desperately need. The White House is refusing to expand the list of presumptive health conditions that have been scientifically shown to be connected with the use of Agent Orange to include four conditions\u2014 Parkinsonism, Bladder Cancer, Hypertension, and Hypothyroidism. The Trump Administration doesn\u2019t seem to think that exposure to these toxic chemicals in Vietnam is a cost of war. Well, guess what? They\u2019re wrong. It is a cost of war. And it wasn\u2019t until a veteran filed a Freedom of Information Act request that we finally figured out what the hold-up was: the hold-up was the Trump administration. They didn\u2019t want to pay for it. According to these revealed documents, President Trump\u2019s first VA Secretary\u2014Dr. David Shulkin\u2014 recommended way back in the fall of 2017 that these conditions associated with Agent Orange be added. The VA urged the White House to expand eligibility, so these veterans could get the benefits they\u2019ve earned for conditions like Bladder Cancer, Parkinson\u2019s-like symptoms and Hypothyroidism. But Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and the White House objected. They didn\u2019t want to spend the money. They said they wanted more studies \u2013 studies that would effectively run out the clock as more and more of these veterans suffer and die from their diseases caused by Agent Orange. Since then, the National Academies of Medicine has found even greater evidence that Agent Orange exposure results in conditions like Hypertension. Mick Mulvaney and the White House need to stop ignoring the overwhelming scientific evidence put forth by scientists, medical experts, and veterans, and commit to taking care of the 83,000 veterans who are suffering and dying from health conditions associated with this exposure. Yet the White House refuses to recognize the cost of war and continues to ignore Vietnam Veterans in their 60s, in their 70s, in their 80s\u2013 veterans who have already waited decades for the benefits that they desperately need. And this isn\u2019t the only problem. Veterans who served off the shores of Vietnam, who were also exposed to Agent Orange, well, they are out of luck too. Congress has done their job. But this Administration has put a hold on all the benefits that go to the veterans who served in Vietnam offshore\u2014 that drank water contaminated by Agent Orange, that took baths in it, those who were exposed to it. Yet the Trump White House once again refused to recognize that these Blue Water Navy Veterans needed help. If the White House claims to be an advocate for veterans, it\u2019s time to show it. No more excuses. Veterans are dying and their families are not getting the benefits that they have earned. Let\u2019s do right by these veterans and their families. End the wait for those who have already sacrificed greatly.\u201d Follow Ian\u00a0Hanchett on Twitter\u00a0@IanHanchett",

      "subtitle": "WASHINGTON, DC \u2014 Dr. Fiona Hill, a former National Security Council (NSC) official, indicated to House impeachment investigators during a public hearing earlier this week that senior White House official Kash Patel did not try to misrepresent himself to President Trump as an all-knowing expert on Ukraine, as reported by\u00a0Politico.",
      "author": "Edwin Mora",
      "content": " In other words, Hill, during her November 21 testimony, undermined two Politico reports that Patel claimed the news outlet gleaned from false leaks from House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA), the chief impeachment inquisitor. In a defamation lawsuit filed November 18, Patel accused\u00a0Natasha Bertrand, a national security reporter for Politico, of\u00a0writing two false stories based on false information allegedly leaked by Schiff and his staff claiming the White House official\u00a0was feeding Trump negative information about Ukraine. Bertrand suggested Patel misrepresented himself as a sort of top Ukraine expert or director of U.S. policy towards the country. Hill\u2019s testimony appears to suggest Patel stayed out of Ukraine matters.\u00a0Patel is a former staffer for Rep. Devin Nunes from California, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee. After serving for Nunes, Patel later moved to the White House in the NSC to advise the president on national security and intelligence matters. Hill resigned as the deputy assistant to the President and senior director for European and Russian Affairs at the NSC days before the July 25 phone call considered the crux of the impeachment inquiry. Former Trump national security adviser John Bolton served as Hill\u2019s boss. Hill was very involved in U.S. policy towards Ukraine, so if Patel would have played any role in pushing any sort of narrative about the Eastern European country, she would have likely been aware. Schiff and/or members of his staff leaked false information to\u00a0Politico\u00a0as part of a \u201cscheme\u201d to advance efforts to impeach and remove Trump. Senior NSC counterterrorism official Patel filed a lawsuit last Monday accusing Politico of defaming him as it tried to fuel the House Democrats\u2019 impeachment probe with false information that was supposed to originate from closed-door testimony. To fit his narrative, Schiff allegedly provided altered information from the closed-door deposition obtained from Hill and NSC Director of European Affairs Lt. Col. Alexander\u00a0Vindman. Hill denied some of that information. During Hill\u2019s public hearing on Thursday, Daniel Goldman, the Democrat\u2019 Intelligence Committee lawyer, asked Hill, \u201cKash Patel did not work on Ukraine matters that you oversaw, is that right?\u201d \u201cNot that I oversaw, no,\u201d Hill responded, contradicting, at least in part, the claims made by Politico. Despite Hill\u2019s denial, Goldman pressed, \u201cSo the indication is that Kash Patel had provided some information directly to the President without your knowledge?\u201d \u201cThat seems to be the indication,\u201d she replied, apparently referring to news articles and hearsay by unnamed White House officials. In other words, Hill did not have first-hand knowledge that Patel provided negative Ukraine information to Trump. She only presumed that he did after the Politico stories, based on information allegedly leaked by Schiff and his staff, came to light. Via the\u00a0Politico articles \u2014 one of which was published aheadof Hill\u2019s public testimony\u00a0\u2014Schiff could have made it seem that Patel was providing negative Ukraine information to Trump to fit his impeachment agenda. It would have been unlikely for Hill, who was charged with Ukraine within the same office that employed Patel, not to know who was saying what about the Eastern European country to Trump. Under questioning by a Democrat lawmaker, Hill explicitly denied that Patel had attempted to represent himself to the president as the director of Ukraine, which is what the information provided by Schiff and his staff to Politico suggested. Attempting to put words in her mouth, Rep. Eric\u00a0Swalwell asked the witness, \u201cSo I want to walk you through something you told us earlier. You said that you have evidence that as recently as this year, President Trump believes someone named Kash was that Ukraine director. Is that right?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not really evidence. And look, I want to be very clear about this. I was asked a question about this in my [October 14 closed door] deposition. I did not raise it. And to be honest, I was surprised I was asked the question.\u201d During her deposition in October, Hill told investigators that Patel served in a\u00a0leadership post focusing on counterterrorism for the\u00a0NSC\u2019s Directorate of International Organizations and Alliances. When Daniel Noble, a senior counsel for the House Democrats pursuing the impeachment probe, asked Hill what appeared to be a leading question about Patel\u2019s role at the NSC, Hill stressed that he was not the Ukraine director. Echoing the Politico articles \u2014 again gleaned from allegedly false information provided by Schiff and his staff, Noble, not Hill, suggested that Trump relied on Patel as the NSC\u2019s Ukraine director. Noble said she was \u201cconfused\u201d when an unnamed White House official described Patel as the Ukraine director who was expected to debrief Trump on Ukraine in May, soon after the inauguration of the country\u2019s new President, Volodymyr Zelensky. Hill pointed out that she was \u201csurprised\u201d an official described Patel as the NSC Ukrainian director, because that title belonged to Col. Vindman. She noted that she found out that Patel had a role on Ukraine, but not as director. At Noble\u2019s behest, Hill made it clear that she did not know in what capacity Patel was working on Ukraine or what sort of materials he was providing to the president about the country, if any. Regarding the debriefing meeting, she added, \u201cI had never heard any information to suggest that [Patel] was there.\u201d\u00a0Vindman, however, did participate. Hill never brought up Patel during her October 14 deposition, as she indicated during her public hearing. Noble, however, asked, \u201cWhat was [Patel\u2019s] role as far as you know?\u201d The former senior director for European and Russian Affairs at the NSC responded, \u201cI thought, well, he is in our International 0rganizations Bureau and, you know, considerably he works on the U.N. and other related\u00a0issues but he\u2019s not the Ukraine director. It appears the Democrats made an attempt to make Hill say Patel served as a Ukraine director, bypassing Vindman, but they failed. Had Hill identified Patel as the Ukraine director, she would have confirmed the Politico articles, at least in part, that the NSC official was misrepresenting himself to Trump. Again, Schiff and his staff leaked the allegedly false info behind the Politico reports allegedly berating Patel. Patel filed a defamation lawsuit against\u00a0Politico, Bertrand, and\u00a0Robert Allbritton, the publisher and executive chairman of the media organization, all identified as defendants. In the lawsuit, Patel proclaims: Between October 14, 2019 and November 8, 2019, Politico and Bertrand colluded, collaborated and conspired with Schiff to defame Kash. Schiff, or members of his staff or aides acting at his direction, leaked to Bertrand the closed-door testimony that Hill and Vindman\u00a0gave in the subfloor of the Capitol Visitor Center. The leaks occurred in real-time. Schiff leaked the testimony to Bertrand because Schiff knew that it would be a violation of House Rules and Committee Rules for Schiff to publish the substance of the testimony himself. The joint collaborative purpose of the leaks was to publish Hill and Vindman\u2019s false and defamatory statements, including Hill and Vindman\u2019s egregious personal attacks on Kash, so as to further Schiff and\u00a0Politico\u2019s\u00a0interests in harming the President and advancing the impeachment inquisition. In furtherance of the conspiracy, Bertrand secretly communicated with Schiff or his staff via encrypted email, including proton-mail, and messaging services, such as Signal. The lawsuit identifies the two Bertrand Politico articles as \u201cNunes Protege Fed Ukraine Info to Trump\u201c\u2014 published on October 23, and \u201cTestimony: Nunes Acolyte Misrepresented to Trump as Ukraine Expert\u201d published on October 30. The articles suggest Patel tried to fill Trump\u2019s mind with bad thoughts about Ukraine. Patel is a former staffer for Nunes, who later moved to the White House in the NSC to advise the president on national security and intelligence matters.",

      "subtitle": "U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s decision not to be drawn into military conflict with Iran was attacked by France\u2019s defense minister on Saturday, with Florence Parly lamenting the absence of an American military response in the oil-rich region.",
      "author": "Simon Kent",
      "content": " Parly added France also deplored Trump\u2019s unilateral withdrawal of America from Iran\u2019s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers that was brokered by Barack Obama. She said that move led to the re-imposition of crushing sanctions against Iran, as well as Tehran recently breaking the deal\u2019s enrichment, stockpile and centrifuge limits. France would continue to talk to Iran, she said in her speech before the annual Manama Dialogue in Bahrain, striking a rare muscular military tone for Paris, which maintains a naval base in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates. However Parly did not indicate an immediate injection of French assets into the region to fill the vacuum she claims has been left by the U.S. Rather, she said France would consider a European-organized maritime security force in the region that would cooperate with but be separate from an American-organized deployment. She gave no timeline for this as yet to be formed European naval expeditionary force. French Defence Minister Florence Parly attends the opening of the 15th Manama Dialogue, a regional security summit organized by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) in the Bahraini capital on November 22, 2019. (MAZEN MAHDI/AFP via Getty Images) \u201cWe\u2019ve seen deliberate, gradual U.S. disengagement,\u201d Parly told the summit, organized by the International Institute for Strategic Studies. \u201cIt had been on the cards for a while but it became clear when fighter jets remained on the tarmac in 2013 after the Syrian chemical attacks or later, after the downing of a U.S. UAV and the bombing of Saudi oil facilities.\u201d \u201cWith the cornerstone moving, the edifice has started shaking,\u201d she said. Since the summer, there have been a series of attacks in the region, starting first with the suspected mining of oil tankers near the Strait of Hormuz. The U.S. blames Iran for the attacks, something Tehran denies. Iran did shoot down a U.S. military surveillance drone and seize oil tankers. A September drone-and-cruise-missile attack on Saudi oil fields halved the kingdom\u2019s crude oil production, shocking energy markets. The U.S. blames that attack on Iran as well, something Iran denies. Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels claimed the attack, but analysts say the weapons used likely would not have the range to reach the sites from rebel-held territory and appeared to come in from the north of the Persian Gulf, not from the south toward Yemen. \u201cWhen the mining of ships went unanswered, a drone got shot (down). When that in turn went unanswered, major oil facilities were bombed,\u201d Parly said. \u201cThis is dangerous, even for those who think they gain. Because bold is never far from daring and daring never far from reckless.\u201d Parly spoke just days after the U.S. confirmed the USS\u00a0Abraham Lincoln\u00a0aircraft carrier strike group transited the Strait of Hormuz, after it was ordered by the White House to rapidly deploy to the Mideast to meet heightened threats from Iran. A helicopter lifts off of the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln as it transits the Strait of Hormuz. The U.S. aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln sent to the Mideast in May over tensions with Iran transited the narrow Strait of Hormuz for the first time on Tuesday. The ship previously had been in the Arabian Sea outside of the Persian Gulf. (Mass Communication Specialist Seaman Stephanie Contreras/U.S. Navy via AP) The U.S. Navy says the\u00a0Lincoln\u00a0entered the strait as it steamed towards the Persian Gulf. The carrier left Norfolk, VA, in April and was diverted to the Middle East in May, but it had remained in the Arabian Sea, avoiding passage through the contested waters that border Iran. There is no record of a fighting French naval force currently at sea anywhere in the region. AP contributed to this report",

Adam Schiff (D-CA) called the evidence \u201coverwhelming\u201d that showed President Donald\u00a0Trump\u00a0sacrificed the national security for \u201cpersonal political gain.\u201d Schiff said, \u201cWhat matters to Donald Trump is what matters to him personally and politically the rest, our national security, our allies none of that matters compares to what the president thinks is good for him. \u201d He continued, \u201cThe evidence is overwhelming. The remarkable thing about this and we\u2019ve done with this literally no documentary production from the administration is the facts are really not contested. It is really not contested what the president did. What is open to question is whether members of Congress are going to do their duty and whether there will be anyone like Howard Baker, anyone on the Republican side that is willing to put their country, their Constitution above the party or the person of the president because I don\u2019t think he represents what the Republican Party used to stand for.\u201d He added, \u201cI certainly think that the evidence has that been produced overwhelmingly shows serious misconduct by the president. But I do want to hear more from my constituents and my colleagues. This is not a decision I\u2019m making alone. But at the end of the day, this is a decision about whether the founding fathers had in mind this kind of misconduct when they gave Congress this remedy. And I have to think that this is very much central to what they were concerned about, that is an unethical man or woman takes that office and uses it for personal political gain and sacrifices the national security to do so, if that wasn\u2019t what the founders had in mind, it is hard to imagine what they did.\u201d Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN",

When asked if he would be willing to testify in the Senate, Schiff said, \u201cThere is nothing to testify about. I think if the president or his allies in the Senate persist, it means they are not serious about what they are doing.\u201d Host Jake Tapper said, \u201cSorry for interrupting. They would cite David Kendall, President Clinton\u2019s attorney, got to cross-examine Ken Starr. I understand you are not an independent council, but you did lead the investigation.\u201d Schiff said, \u201cI\u2019m not a special counsel. I don\u2019t work for a separate branch of government. I\u2019m not in the Justice Department. I am more in a position that Henry Hyde was during the impeachment or Peter Rodino or Sam Ervin. They were not fact witnesses. What would I offer in terms of testimony that I heard Dr. Hill in open hearing say such and such? That is not pertinent. The only reason for them to go through with this is to mollify the president, and that is not a good reason to try to call a member of Congress as a witness.\u201d Tapper asked, \u201cBut there are questions you could answer about your staff having been approached by the whistleblower before he filed his complaint and other matters, things that you could shed light on our explain. Would you refuse to go if the Senate wanted you to come as a witness?\u201d Schiff added, \u201cI don\u2019t want to comment on it except to say that if they go down this road, it shows a fundamental lack of seriousness, a willingness to try to turn this into a circus-like the president would like, and I hope they don\u2019t go there. There are others who are fact witnesses. We didn\u2019t call in Senator Johnson. We\u2019re not calling in Devin Nunes. We didn\u2019t call in Senator Graham.

An Oklahoma State review committee found that school officials had \u201cdistressed, confused and humiliated\u201d Bailey, as well as demonstrated a \u201csystematic failure to follow university policy,\u201d which the professor alleges also resulted in her losing out on paid projects and a promotion at\u00a0the university\u2019s College of Human Sciences. \u201cDespite positive feedback and accolades for her work, she says she was denied because of her position in HHS and her Republican Party membership,\u201d reports News 9. \u201cThat denial she argues is a violation of her First Amendment rights.\u201d The report added that Bailey also alleges that Oklahoma State Provost Gary Sandefur, College of Human Sciences Dean Stephan Wilson, and university officials Sissy Osteen and Jarrod Noftsger displayed a pattern of partisan bias and oftentimes publicly criticized President Donald Trump and his supporters. In one incident of bias, Noftsger had allegedly referred to a Trump official as a \u201cfictional movie villain,\u201d stating that conservative views were \u201cwhy we can\u2019t have nice things.\u201d \u201cOSU\u00a0is obligated to assist with the legal defense of claims made against its employees acting within the course and scope of their employment,\u201d said a university spokesperson, according to News 9.

      "content": " On Sunday\u2019s broadcast of CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said the Trump administration was preparing a robust defense of President Donald Trump during a possible Senate impeachment trial. Partial transcript as follows: BRENNAN: Well, I want to get on to what is happening here in Washington with this week of hearings. The president has said he wants a trial in the Senate, but then others at the White House say they\u2019re not even sure Democrats will move ahead with impeachment. What exactly are you preparing for? CONWAY: We\u2019re preparing for both eventualities. And here\u2019s why, Margaret. If we- if it does go to a trial in the Senate, and that is not certain right now. You\u2019ve got a lot of Democrats wringing their hands that they did not see, as Will Hurd\u2014 a moderate Democrat, excuse me, a moderate Republican who\u2019s retiring this year\u2014 said he did not see overwhelming, compelling, clear, and convincing evidence. Many of those Democrats, especially the ones who represent the 31 Trump-Pence districts from \u201916, they have to go back home and say, \u201cI know I promised to lower your drug prices. I know I promised to keep this great economy going on. I know I promised trade deals like USMCA, but we\u2019re busy impeaching a president.\u201d And they\u2019re getting blowback for that. So I think for those Democrats, they\u2019re- it\u2019s not completely certain yet. Some of them have actually gone on the record saying, \u201cI\u2019m not there yet. I have to see what the articles say and what the report is.\u201d But we know what they didn\u2019t see this- over twelve witnesses in two weeks of testimony and over 30 hours. They didn\u2019t hear anybody say when they were asked bribery? No. Extortion? No. Quid pro quo for the aid? No. Preconditions for a meeting? Did the president commit a crime? No, no, no every time. The closest they got to it was Sondland in his prepared remarks saying he thought there was a quid pro quo for a meeting. BRENNAN: Right. CONWAY: They had the meeting on September 22nd in- in- in New York. And also the aide went to Ukraine earlier than that. BRENNAN: Right. CONWAY: So they got their aid. They\u2019ve got javelins and cyber rifles. The Ukrainian policy under President Trump is better than it was previously and Ukraine has more aid. BRENNAN: So, Sondland, you mentioned there who testified he laid out a few different things there. But I\u2019m wondering, you know, he serves at the pleasure of the president. Is he going to keep his job despite testifying against him? CONWAY: He flew right back to Brussels, Belgium. I don\u2019t know that he testified against the president. Again, I need to remind the viewers that when Sondland was- when Ambassador Sondland was asked by Adam Schiff, who I guess was waiting for a different response, \u201cso the quid pro quo was for the aid?\u201d And Sondland said, \u201cno, the quid pro quo was for a meeting or a statement.\u201d Ambassador Volker separately testified they abandoned the whole idea of making a statement to focus on the aid. That was very smart because Ukraine got its aid. Margaret, we simply can\u2019t impeach and remove a democratically elected president from office because you didn\u2019t beat him- they didn\u2019t beat him in 2016. They haven\u2019t a clue how to beat him in 2020. They don\u2019t much like him. And I think that in the- if there is a Senate trial, we\u2019ll be able to- that\u2019ll be more familiar to most Americans. This process is unfamiliar to them, where the president\u2013 BRENNAN: Meaning there will be witnesses? CONWAY: \u2014 can\u2019t even have- there\u2019ll be witnesses. The president couldn\u2019t even have his own attorneys in there. And that\u2019s- that\u2019s not very fair to the, quote, defendant. But I think defense will go on offense if there is a Senate trial and they\u2019ll be- we\u2019ll be able to call witnesses, we\u2019ll be able to challenge their witnesses, produce other evidence. And those witnesses may include the whistleblower, and I would say his attorney, because his attorney, Mark Zaid, had an email or a text\u2013 BRENNAN: Right.

Partial transcript as follows: BRENNAN: We\u2019re back now with the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Congressman Jim Himes. He joins us from his district in Stamford, Connecticut. Good morning to you. Congressman, you- you heard the White House case as laid out by Kellyanne Conway. Is there a chance that the House actually doesn\u2019t move ahead with impeachment? HIMES:\u00a0 Yeah. Case is an interesting way to put what Kellyanne Conway just did. I was keeping pretty close track, and I\u2019m pretty sure that every single one of her assertions was inaccurate. Let me give you the big example, and then I\u2019ll come back around to your question. She said, \u201cHey, nothing happened here. The aide was released and the meeting happened.\u201d Now, you could look this up because I understand that the White House is all about making facts slippery, but both of those things happened. The aide was released and the meeting happened, not in the Oval Office. But the aide was released and the meeting happened after they were caught, after September 9th when the inspector general of the intelligence community came to Congress and said, \u201cThere\u2019s this whistleblower complaint.\u201d And the White House, by the way, had seen that complaint. So when the jig was up, yes, then the aid was released once they were caught. But she\u2019s also wrong, just to get back to your question, I haven\u2019t spoken to all 240 or so of my colleagues, but- but I don\u2019t think any Democrat in the Congress looked at what happened over the last two weeks and said, \u201cGosh, there\u2019s nothing there.\u201d Much to the contrary. Like the American public that was paying attention, my colleagues saw an ambassador fired for corrupt purposes, saw aid being held up, ad by the way, you know, she\u2014 BRENNAN: Yeah. HIMES: \u2013Kellyanne Conway may quibble about- about what Sondland said. The chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, said there was a quid pro quo, and we should get over it. So, no, there\u2019s not a Democrat who watched the last two weeks and said, \u201cGosh, this is a weaker case than I thought it was.\u201d Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN",

Roger Wicker (R-MS) said after the House Intelligence Committee public impeachment inquiry hearings that the Democrats had \u201ca bad week last week.\u201d Partial transcript as follows: WICKER: Let me say this, Chuck, I just have to start, I totally disagree with your lead-in to this whole show today. TODD: OK. WICKER: I think the Washington punditry is somewhat in a bubble on this. I think the Democrats had a bad week \u2014 TODD: Why is that? WICKER: Well, okay, for one thing, the polls are turning in the president\u2019s favor. You\u2019ve got the Marquette Poll in Wisconsin, which is the gold standard of Wisconsin polls. Then you\u2019ve got the Emerson Poll, which is a nationwide poll, which actually shows Trump\u2019s favorability going up. And I just think the people out there don\u2019t think this investigation is fair. They know that only Democrat witnesses were allowed to be called. None of the witnesses \u2014 TODD: That\u2019s not true. They made requests. Some of them were indeed called. There were some witnesses that Republicans requested that were called. WICKER: And as a matter of fact, here\u2019s what happened. There were three witnesses that Democrats asked for and Republicans asked for. Those three witnesses \u2014 TODD: Fair enough. WICKER: \u2014 got called. None of the witnesses that were exclusively called by the Republicans were asked. And you know, you asked the question about the whistleblower. And so, Chairman Schiff has decided that it wouldn\u2019t be beneficial to his case. Well, it might be beneficial if some of the Republicans were allowed to cross-examine this person.

Maxine Waters (D-CA) said former neurosurgeon Ben Carson did not have the \u201cintelligence\u201d for his current position as\u00a0Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. Carson had said Waters lacks basic manners after she had written President Donald Trump a letter demanding answers on reports that the administration was considering moving homeless people off the streets in California. Waters said, \u201cI sent him a letter, and he sent me a letter claiming that I had no manner, etc. I basically said to my staff, I really don\u2019t have time to be bonded by somebody who does not know the difference between REO and OEO. This guy just doesn\u2019t have the background, the capability, the intelligence to do the job. He does not know what he\u2019s doing. He doesn\u2019t care about this issue.\u201d Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN",

The video montage features a message that reads \u201cMSNBC Has a Problem With Bernie Sanders.\u201d MSNBC anchors like Chris Matthews are seen heckling and railing against Sen. Sanders. \u201cHe\u2019s just waiving his arms around talking about revolution, we all need revolution,\u201d Matthews says at one point in the video. Elsewhere in the clip MSNBC anchor and commentator Donny Deutsch says \u201ca socialist candidate is more dangerous to this country, as far as the stretch and wellbeing of our country, than Donald Trump.\u201d Cusack\u2019s Twitter account is full of pro-Sanders fare and furious screeds at President Trump and his supporters. In March, the\u00a02012\u00a0star said of Trump that \u201cthe only way democracy survives him \u2013 is if he rots in prison.\u201d In May, Cusack issued a profanity-laced warning to Democrats:\u00a0\u201cJust a reminder there\u2019s a fucking Nazi in the White House & everyone around him are criminal enablers \u2013 Dems begin impeachment hearings or resign for abdicating yr oaths.
