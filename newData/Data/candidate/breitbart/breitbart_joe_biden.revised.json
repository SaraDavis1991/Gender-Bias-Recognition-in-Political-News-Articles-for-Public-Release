      "content": " \u201cChina has long pursued the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries,\u201d foreign ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang said in a statement, according to the South China Morning Post. \u201cWe have no intention of intervening in the domestic affairs of the United States. Our position is consistent and clear.\u201d Speaking to reporters outside the White House last week, President Trump floated the idea that China and Ukraine should probe the Biden family. \u201cChina should start an investigation into the Bidens, because what happened in China is just about as bad as Ukraine,\u201d the president said\u00a0ahead of a visit to\u00a0Florida to deliver remarks on Medicare. As Breitbart News reported, Hunter Biden\u2019s investment company secured a\u00a0$1.5 billion investment deal\u00a0with the Bank of China after traveling with his father on Air Force Two to the country in 2013. Asked if Ukraine should follow suit with its own inquiry into the Bidens, President Trump replied:\u00a0\u201cI would think that if they were honest about it, they would start a major investigation,\u201d before adding: \u201cNobody has any doubt that they weren\u2019t crooked; that was a crooked deal, 100 percent.\u201d As Breitbart News\u00a0reported\u00a0earlier this year: Biden forced out former Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin as he was investigating an energy company called\u00a0Burisma Holdings, which was paying Biden [$83,000 monthly] as a member of its board. The former vice president even\u00a0boasted\u00a0to the Council of Foreign Relations last year that he had threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid unless the prosecutor was fired. (He did not tell the audience about his son\u2019s role.) While Democrats and establishment media figures were enraged by President Trump\u2019s suggestion for China and Ukraine to probe the Biden, leading Republicans, including Vice President Mike Pence, voiced support for the move. \u201cIn 2016, the American people elected President Trump and I for many reasons: get the economy moving again, to rebuild our military, but they also elected us to drain the swamp,\u201d Pence told\u00a0the Arizona Republic.\u201cI think the American people have a right to know if someone who held the second-highest office in the land was involved in corrupt activities, either in China or in Ukraine.\u201d",

      "subtitle": "Joe Biden told a harrowing story during an event in 2017 about facing down a razor-wielding gang leader named Corn Pop in his youth by threatening to \u201cwrap\u201d a chain around the man\u2019s head. The incident came back into the spotlight over the weekend when footage of Biden\u2019s remarks began circulating social media.",
      "author": "Haris Alic",
      "content": " The former vice president, who has come under scrutiny in recent weeks for embellishing portions of his personal and\u00a0political\u00a0life, told the story when being honored with having a community pool named after him in a Wilmington, Delaware, historically black neighborhood. Biden had reportedly been the only white lifeguard at the pool during the early 1960s when segregation was still in effect. The event started with Biden discussing how his time as a lifeguard had opened his eyes about racial injustice and privilege. It, however, quickly took a strange turn when Biden, flanked by children from the local community,\u00a0decided to recount a nearly violent altercation he had at the pool with a misbehaving swimmer. \u201cCorn Pop was a bad dude, and he ran a bunch of bad boys. Back in those days, to show how things have changed \u2026 if you used pomade in your hair, you had to wear a bathing cap,\u201d Biden said. \u201cHe was up on the board and wouldn\u2019t listen to me, so I said \u2018Hey, Esther, you, off the board or I\u2019ll come up and drag you off.'\u201d Corn Pop, according to the former vice president, did not take kindly to being called \u201cEsther\u201d \u2014 an \u201cemasculating\u201d reference to the 1950s swimmer Esther Williams,\u00a0as the Washington Post noted \u2014 and promised to \u201cmeet\u201d him outside. Biden realized he had to take Corn Pop seriously when he purportedly saw the gang leader waiting around for him with three other guys carrying straight razors.  In his 2007 autobiography,\u00a0Promises to Keep: On Life and Politics, Biden\u00a0admitted that he specifically signaled out Corn Pop for violating the pool\u2019s rules to show he \u201cwasn\u2019t an easy mark.\u201d The former vice president also wrote that his first instinct was to call the police, but he was convinced by the pool\u2019s mechanic, a white former Navy sailor named Bill Wright, that doing so would ensure he would never be trusted by the neighborhood\u2019s black community. Instead, Wright suggested Biden confront Corn Pop and the others with \u201ca six-foot length of chain.\u201d Biden, as he described in his autobiography, took the advice, walked outside, and said, \u201cYou might cut me, Corn Pop, but I\u2019m going to wrap this chain around your head before you do.\u201d \u201cI looked at him, but I was smart then,\u201d Biden told the audience in 2017. He said he told Corn Pop, \u201cfirst of all, when I tell you to get off the board, you get off the board, and I\u2019ll kick you out again, but I shouldn\u2019t have called you Esther Williams. I apologize for that. \u2026 I apologize for what I said.\u201d The apology seemed to diffuse the situation, much to Biden\u2019s relief. \u201cHe said \u2018okay,\u2019 closed his straight razor, and my heart began to beat again,\u201d the former vice president said. The story came back into the spotlight on Saturday after numerous individuals shared clips from the 2017 pool dedication on social media. Many of those seeing the clip for the first time immediately accused the former vice president of fabricating the story. Most notably, Michael Harriot, a senior writer for The Root, took to social media to blast the story as \u201calien-like.\u201d     Although Biden\u2019s retelling of the altercation was corroborated at the dedication ceremony by a former chairman of the Delaware NAACP, those unaware of the fact agreed with Harriot that the story seemed comically embellished if not totally concocted. Biden, himself, has not done his credibility any favors in recent weeks by downplaying his fabrication of an emotional story about the war in Afghanistan, even after the Post\u00a0debunked nearly every detail.",

      "author": "David Ng",
      "content": " Deadline reported that\u00a0former Vice President Biden will attend two Hollywood fundraisers on Thursday \u2014 one in the afternoon hosted by former HBO executive\u00a0Michael Lombardo,\u00a0and one in the evening at the home of Paramount Pictures chairman and CEO Jim Gianopulos. CNN\u2019s town hall, titled Equality in America,\u00a0is set to air Thursday evening, from\u00a07:30 p.m. to 12 a.m. ET, and will feature nine Democratic presidential candidates. The event is co-organized by the\u00a0Human Rights Campaign Foundation, a non-profit focused on LGBTQ issues. The town hall comes amidst increased U.S.-China tensions \u2014 a subject that hits close to home in the entertainment industry, \u00a0which depends heavily on Chinese consumers to buy movie tickets and visit theme parks. Hollywood executives have remained conspicuously quiet about U.S.-China relations in the wake of democracy protests in Hong Kong that have put global businesses including the NBA to Apple in a difficult spot. President Donald Trump has publicly hammered Biden over his close ties with China, accusing the former Vice President and his son, Hunter,\u00a0\u00a0of being \u201cpaid off\u201d by foreign interests. Moderators of Thursday\u2019s town hall include CNN\u2019s Dana Bash, Anderson Cooper, Chris Cuomo, Don Lemon and Nia-Malika Henderson. Sen. Harris (D-CA) reportedly attended a reception at The Abbey in West Hollywood on Wednesday, while\u00a0Buttigieg is set to attend a fundraiser at the Belasco Theater in downtown L.A. Deadline reported earlier this week that Buttigieg\u00a0attended a separate L.A. fundraiser on Tuesday at the home of former CAA agent Michael Kives, who is now head of the investment advisory firm K5 Global. Celebrities who were reportedly in attendance include Leonardo DiCaprio, Glenn Close, Ashton Kutcher and Paris Hilton. Hollywood is a reliable fundraising pitstop for Democratic candidates. Hillary Clinton made numerous L.A. visits in her failed 2016 bid for the White House, including events with mega donor and billionaire Haim Saban, the founder of Saban Entertainment. CNN\u2019s town hall is set to take place at the Novo, at the\u00a0L.A. Live complex in downtown L.A. Other Democratic presidential hopefuls scheduled to appear include Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Beto O\u2019Rourke, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro,\u00a0Tom Steyer and\u00a0Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ).

      "content": " The sketch sees Vice President Mike Pence (Beck Bennett), Trump\u2019s attorney Rudy Guiliani (Kate McKinnon), Attorney General Bill Barr (Aidy Bryant), and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo (Matthew Broderick) discussing how to deal with recent moves by Democrats in Congress attempting to impeach the President Donald Trump after he supposedly \u201cabused his power by pushing Ukraine\u00a0to investigate his political rival\u201d Joe Biden. \u201cListen, I\u2019ve been asking around, and I think that this whole impeachment thing could be really bad,\u201d\u00a0 Pompeo declares. \u201cNot according to this \u2018Breitbart Office Poll\u2019 that says 121 percent of people want Biden impeached,\u201d responds Guiliani, holding up a copy of the results.

The first poll asked Breitbart readers whether they \u201cstand with President Trump,\u201d 97.83 percent of whom said they did, while 2.17 percent said they did not.  The second poll\u00a0asked whether House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) should \u201cresign and be investigated,\u201d to which a whopping 98.4 said he should, while just 1.6 percent said he should not.

      "subtitle": "Peter Schweizer, president of the Government Accountability Institute and senior editor-at-large at Breitbart News, recalled how Hunter Biden, Joe Biden\u2019s second son, received millions of dollars from Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings while his father directed $1.8 billion in aid money to Ukraine as vice president during the Obama administration.",
      "author": "Robert Kraychik",
      "content": " Schweizer joined Tuesday\u2019s edition of SiriusXM\u2019s Breitbart News Tonight with hosts Rebecca Mansour and Joel Pollak. Schweizer said, \u201cI think a deeper problem that [Joe Biden] faces is \u2014 as has been reported on Breitbart and reported at the Hill, today \u2014 which I think is far deeper is the fact that his family, particularly his son, cashed in while he was vice president of the United States.\u201d LISTEN:  John Solomon reported on Hunter Biden\u2019s receiving millions of dollars from Burisma Holdings after being installed on the company\u2019s board during his father\u2019s vice presidential tenure: U.S. banking records show Hunter Biden\u2019s American-based firm, Rosemont Seneca Partners LLC, received regular transfers into one of its accounts \u2013 usually more than $166,000 a month \u2013 from Burisma from spring 2014 through fall 2015, during a period when Vice President Biden was the main U.S. official dealing with Ukraine and its tense relations with Russia.\u201d The general prosecutor\u2019s official file for the Burisma probe \u2013 shared with me by senior Ukrainian officials \u2013 shows prosecutors identified Hunter Biden, business partner Devon Archer and their firm, Rosemont Seneca, as potential recipients of money. Shokin told me in written answers to questions that, before he was fired as general prosecutor, he had made \u201cspecific plans\u201d for the investigation that \u201cincluded interrogations and other crime-investigation procedures into all members of the executive board, including Hunter Biden.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve talked before about the deals he procured with the government for China,\u201d remembered Schweizer. \u201cThe other place [Joe Biden\u2019s] son, Hunter Biden, procured a big deal was in Ukraine. In Ukraine, it involved an energy company called Burisma, which is a very corrupt organization headed by an oligarch named Mykola Zlochevsky who is very close to ViktorYanukovich, the pro-Russian leader.\u201d Schweizer asked, \u201cThere\u2019s all kinds of questions and implications. Is there a Russian component to this, because Burisma is such a corrupt company?\u201d \u201cThe bottom line is Joe Biden was the Obama administration\u2019s point-person on policy towards Ukraine,\u201d noted Schweizer. \u201cHe steered $1.8 billion in aid to that government and while he was doing so, his son got a sweetheart deal with this energy company \u2013 that we\u2019ve been able to trace over just a 14-month period \u2013 paid $3.1 million into an account where Hunter Biden was getting paid.\u201d Schweizer highlighted Hunter Biden\u2019s lack of professional or experiential bona fides in terms of his board position at Burisma Holdings. \u201cSuffice to say, Hunter Biden has no background in Ukraine,\u201d stated Schweizer. \u201cHe has no background in energy policy. There\u2019s really no legitimate explanation as to why he got this deal with this energy company, other than the fact his father was responsible for doling out money in Ukraine itself.\u201d Schweizer went on, \u201cIt\u2019s a huge problem, and it goes to this question of corruption and potential payoffs and bribes that these foreign entities were making to the Bidens in exchange for hopefully getting favorable treatment.\u201d Despite the Robert Mueller-led operation\u2019s ostensible pursuit of \u201ccollusion\u201d between President Donald Trump and the Russian state, Schweizer noted actual financial dealings between the Biden family and foreign interests. Schweizer said, \u201cOne of the phrases that has been tossed around as it relates to the Russian collusion hoax was \u2018obstruction of justice\u2019 by Trump, and there\u2019s been no \u2014 at least in my mind \u2014 evidence that that ever happened, and it doesn\u2019t seem that Mueller felt any charges should be brought on that count. But in this case, you would have a pretty clear-cut case of obstruction of justice, where Joe Biden is saying to Ukrainian officials, \u2018We are not going to give you this billion-dollar loan guarantee unless you fire this guy.'\u201d Schweizer added, \u201cThere is far more evidence of collusion involving Joe Biden \u2014 or even involving the Clintons \u2014 of collusion with these foreign powers than there was with Donald Trump, because you actually have the transaction of money, you have very favorable policies that were carried out. I think \u2018collusion\u2019 is not too strong a word. I think it\u2019s a pretty accurate word.\u201d Schweizer added, \u201cThere\u2019s no question. The Bidens got a lot of money \u2014 millions of dollars \u2014 from these foreign powers. Hunter Biden had no legitimate reasons to get the deal. He simply wasn\u2019t qualified.\u201d Schweizer warned of politicians and officials monetizing their political influence. \u201cSo what [Joe Biden] is doing is using U.S. taxpayer government resources for the personal benefit of his family, and by the way, all of this absolutely rings true,\u201d remarked Schweizer. \u201cJoe Biden was the Obama administration\u2019s person on Ukraine, he traveled to that country something like 17 times during his tenure as vice president, which is pretty amazing.\u201d Schweizer went on, \u201cWhat\u2019s remarkable is when, a couple of days before Donald Trump was inaugurated in Washington, D.C., Joe Biden was actually in Ukraine. It\u2019s pretty remarkable for a vice president of the United States to be overseas that late in the game, but he was in Ukraine. [Joe Biden\u2019s] sway and influence there was enormous, and it raises all kinds of questions about the way that he used or abused government power, and of course it raises questions about what potentially did Ukrainians have on Hunter Biden.\u201d \u201cWhat kind of evidence and information do we have?\u201d asked Schweizer of corruption concerns regarding Joe Biden. \u201cWe know that millions of dollars flowed into Hunter Biden\u2019s accounts. We know that he was not qualified for the job, and the question is, what did he get for Ukrainians in return? I think that\u2019s all the sort of thing that needs to be investigated and looked into by a grand jury.\u201d Schweizer added, \u201cYou have a pattern with Hunter Biden. Of a couple of cases that we know of and others that are lingering out there. We know in the case of China he flies with his dad on Air Force Two in December of 2013 and ten days later, his firm gets a $1 billion private equity deal with the Chinese government.\u201d Schweizer continued, \u201cAgain, [Hunter Biden\u2019s] firm has no background in China. Hunter Biden has no background in China. It\u2019s just odd. About four months later, he gets this deal with the Ukrainians, particularly with Burisma. What we also know is, based on financial account records that came out [from] Morgan Stanley that was managed by Hunter Biden\u2019s business partner, a guy named Devon Archer, he handled an account for Morgan Stanley and that account sent huge sums of money to Hunter Biden.\u201d Schweizer went on, \u201cNot only does that account show money coming in from the Chinese and Ukrainians. There\u2019s also $1.2 million that comes from this LLC that we can\u2019t trace. it comes from a boutique Swiss bank account that\u2019s been implicated in money-laundering in ten countries. There\u2019s $145,000 from the son of the former prime minister of Kazakhstan, which is of course a highly corrupt country with all sorts of interesting implications. The point is, Ukraine is not an isolated case. China is not an isolated case.\u201d Joe Biden seems to have monetized his vice presidential powers, speculated Schweizer. Schweizer stated, \u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear you have a pattern that the for-sale sign was open with the Biden family, and that a lot of foreign powers \u2014 including foreign governments \u2014 basically took them up on the offer and gave money to Hunter Biden. That, in and of itself, I think demands investigation in the United States.\u201d \u201cThese financial records by Morgan Stanley [are] very, very clear,\u201d declared Schweizer. \u201cIt shows line after line after line of money going into an account that is marked \u2018Robert H. Biden,\u2019 which is Hunter Biden\u2019s legal name, and it shows huge sums of money coming in from Ukrainians, Chinese, Kazakhs, and anonymous LLCs. It\u2019s all there in black and white.\u201d Hunter Biden sat on the board of Bohai Harvest RST \u2014 an obscure private equity firm \u2014 which\u00a0secured a $1.5 billion investment from the Chinese government, noted Schweizer. \u201cThe deal with China that he had was the first financial deal with the Chinese government that allowed moving assets to the Shanghai Free Trade Zone. So, J.P. Morgan didn\u2019t have this kind of deal, Goldman Sachs didn\u2019t have this kind of deal, Bank of America, Deutsche Bank, the only firm that had this deal was this small boutique firm that had been started a couple of years ago by the vice president\u2019s son.\u201d In March 2018, an aide of Joe Biden\u2019s\u00a0dismissed Schweizer\u2019s investigations and research given Schweizer\u2019s relationship with Breitbart News:\u00a0\u201cWe aren\u2019t going to engage on a politically motivated hit pieces based on a series of demonstrable, factual errors from a Breitbart-affiliated author and his financial backers.\u201d Schweizer said, \u201cSo he can huff and puff and attack me personally all he wants. In part, he attacked me because of my role as an editor at Breitbart, but that doesn\u2019t erase the facts.\u201d On March 12, Joe Biden said he could not \u201cthink of any reason\u201d he would not run for president.\u00a0In December 2018,\u00a0 he said \u201canybody can beat\u201d Donald Trump in 2020\u2019s forthcoming presidential election.

      "subtitle": "Former Vice President Joe Biden added to his long list of gaffes at Wednesday evening\u2019s Democrat presidential primary debate in Detroit, botching everything from the price tag of his opponents\u2019 health care plans to his own closing statement.",
      "author": "Joshua Caplan",
      "content": " Here are seven moments where Biden\u00a0\u2014 now 76-years-old \u2014 misspoke, lost his train of thought, or blurted out actual nonsense during the late-night debate. 1.) Biden tells Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) ahead of the debate: \u201cGo easy on me, kid.\u201d While it may have been his intended word choice, the disrespect to a sitting senator started his debate performance on the wrong foot and distracted from whatever positive message he may have offered. The hot-mic moment was further undermined when Biden went negative on Harris without provocation. 2.) Biden misstates the cost of Harris\u2019s health care plan. On the topic of health care, Biden stated the California Democrat\u2019s \u201cMedicare for All\u201d proposal would cost a staggering $30 trillion \u2014 but he first mistakenly pegged its price tag at only $3 trillion.\u00a0The 2020 frontrunner later repeated the $30 trillion figure, claiming Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT)\u00a0\u201cacknowledges it,\u201d asserting \u201cThirty trillion dollars has to ultimately be paid.\u201d An analysis estimates Sanders\u2019 \u201cMedicare for all\u201d plan would cost the federal government $32.6 trillion over a decade, rendering Biden\u2019s $3 trillion wildly inaccurate. Biden also grossly understated the\u00a0Obama administration\u2019s\u00a010-year\u00a0stimulus\u00a0package of roughly $800\u00a0billion, saying it was $87 billion. 3.) Biden loses his train of thought on health care. \u201cWe immediately are able to cover everybody who wants to get off of their insurance plan they don\u2019t like, no matter what one it is, and buy into a Medicare option,\u201d Biden said. \u201cAnd they can buy the gold plan, and they\u2019re not going to have to pay.\u201d At this moment, rather than complete his explanation of his plan, he offered a verbal pause\u00a0\u2014 \u201canyway\u201d\u00a0\u2014 and trailed off. 4.) Calls Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) \u201cthe future president.\u201d During a contentious exchange on crime legislation, Biden inadvertently predicted a Booker victory in 2020 before correcting himself, saying: \u201cThe fact is that the bills that the president, excuse me, the future president, that the senator is talking about are bills that were passed years ago and they were passed overwhelmingly.\u201d Biden still appeared to have trouble with his words coming out of the gaffe, which drew a big laugh. His continued statement had several awkward phrases: \u201c[The bills] that the senator is talking about are bills that were passed years ago and they were passed overwhelmingly. Since 2007, I, for example, tried to get the crack-powder-cocaine totally\u00a0\u2014 disparity totally eliminated\u201d (emphasis added). 5.) Appears to have misunderstood question about coal. CNN debate moderator Dana Bash asked Biden to clarify his comments on coal, fossil fuels, and fracking. She asks him about the continued existence of those industries, and he appears to agree \u2013but then limits the scope of his answer to subsidies. DANA BASH:\u00a0thank you, vice president.\u00a0just to clarify, would there be\u00a0any place for fossil fuels\u00a0including coal and fracking in a\u00a0biden administration? JOE BIDEN:\u00a0No. We would work it out. We would make sure it\u2019s\u00a0eliminated, and no more subsidies\u00a0for either one of those, any fossil fuel. Biden\u2019s climate change policy makes no mention of eliminating coal as a resource, though it calls for helping coal industry-dependent communities transition to other jobs. 6.) Calls the\u00a0Trans-Pacific Partnership\u00a0(TPP) the \u201cTTP.\u201d Biden said he opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a 12-nation trade agreement headed up by Obama administration, saying:\u00a0\u201cI would not rejoin the TTP [sic] as it was initially put forward. I would insist that we renegotiate pieces of that with the Pacific nations\u2026 so that we could bring them together to hold China accountable.\u201d 7.) Joe\u2019s botched closing statement goes viral. Biden made the debate\u2019s biggest gaffe by screwing up the contact information for his campaign\u2019s text message service. \u201cIf you agree with me, Go to Joe 3-0-3-3-0, thank you very much,\u201d\u00a0Biden said. A cyber-squatter quickly purchased\u00a0\u201cjoe30330.com\u201d after the flub, directing the URL to an unrelated page.\u00a0Biden also messed by arguing that the United States can not handle another \u201ceight years\u201d of a Trump presidency. Trump can only serve for five more years after 2019. Ezra Dulis contributed to this report.",

      "author": "Rebecca Mansour",
      "content": " The Post\u2019s editors highlight comments the former vice president and 2020 Democratic contender made at a campaign rally in Iowa last week dismissing the notion that \u201cChina is going to eat out lunch.\u201d \u201cCome on, man,\u201d Biden scoffed, adding that \u201cthey\u2019re not bad people\u201d and \u201cthey\u2019re not competition for us.\u201d The Post op-ed counters Biden\u2019s assertion with the fact that China is the world\u2019s second-largest economy, and its mercantilist state-run economic system seeks to \u201cdominate global markets\u201d by \u201cstealing intellectual property wherever it can and bribing and bullying other nations with its Belt and Road program to lock up markets across the globe, among other cheats.\u201d As for Biden\u2019s \u201cnot bad people\u201d claim, the Post points to the Beijing regime\u2019s\u00a0flagrant and ruthless oppression of its own people, including the forced internment of one million Uighur Muslims\u00a0into re-education camps. The Post then notes the close financial ties that the private equity firm of Biden\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, has with China\u2019s regime, as documented in Peter Schweizer\u2019s bestselling book, Secret Empires. Beijing is also busy making Big Brother a 21st century reality. Biden should know that, since his son Hunter is an investor in a firm, Bohai Harvest RST, that\u2019s deeply involved in Face++ \u2014 a mobile phone app that Beijing built to spy on its own public. Indeed, the younger Biden has long been in deep with China\u2019s \u201cnot bad\u201d elite, as Peter Schweizer revealed in his book \u201cSecret Empires.\u201d Notably, Hunter\u2019s private equity firm, Rosemont Seneca Partners LLC, swung a $1.5 billion investment deal with the state-owned Bank of China even as his then-vice president dad was engaged in high-end diplomacy with Beijing. Hmm. Maybe Joe Biden just doesn\u2019t dare think about just what \u201cbad folks\u201d China\u2019s rulers really are. Hunter Biden\u2019s Chinese investment firm, Bohai Harvest RST, obtains its financing from a subsidiary of the Communist government-owned Bank of China. As Breitbart\u2019s John Hayward reported, Face++, the tech company Bohai Harvest RST invested in, \u201cprovided the facial-recognition software integrated into the smartphone app used by Chinese security forces to monitor the Uighur Muslims of Xinjiang province. The app plugs into a massive central database that collects an incredible amount of information about Xinjiang citizens, ranging from how much electricity they use to their DNA.\u201d In a March interview with Fox News Channel\u2019s Laura Ingraham, Schweizer explained\u00a0the troubling circumstances surrounding Hunter Biden\u2019s lucrative bank deal with the Chinese government at a time when his father was negotiating U.S. policy with the regime. \u201cIn December of 2013, Hunter Biden flies on Air Force 2 to Beijing, China, with his father,\u201d Schweizer said. \u201cHis father meets with Chinese officials, he\u2019s very soft on Beijing. The most important thing that happens [is] ten days after they return. And that\u2019s when Hunter Biden\u2019s small, private equity firm called Rosemont Seneca Partners gets a $1 billion private equity deal with the Chinese government, not with the Chinese corporation, with the government. And what people need to realize is Hunter Biden has no background in China. He has no background in private equity. The deal he got in the Shanghai free-trade zone, nobody else had \u2014 Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Blackstone, nobody had this deal.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no question when you chart what Joe Biden is doing with China \u2014 the meetings he\u2019s having and the deals that his son is procuring at the same time \u2014 that they are buying off Biden through his son. I think it\u2019s crystal clear,\u201d Schweizer added. In an interview last year with SiriusXM\u2019s Breitbart News Tonight, Schweizer explained China\u2019s foreign influence peddling tactic to get favorable treatment from American politicians. \u201cThe Chinese government has figured out that the way to get favorable treatment from policymakers in Washington, DC, is by, basically, signing sweetheart deals with the children of politicians because they think by doing so, they\u2019ll get better policy positions from our government,\u201d Schweizer said. \u201cAnd the history indicates in the Obama administration that that\u2019s exactly what happens.\u201d Schweizer, the president of the nonpartisan Government Accountability Institute and a senior editor-at-large for Breitbart News, wrote the bestselling 2015 expos\u00e9\u00a0Clinton Cash, which is widely\u00a0credited\u00a0for its instrumental impact on Hillary Clinton\u2019s failed 2016 presidential campaign due to Schweizer\u2019s\u00a0copious\u00a0documentation\u00a0of the former secretary of state\u2019s history of amassing wealth from donors seeking favorable actions from her State Department. Schweizer\u2019s research on Hunter Biden has already\u00a0triggered\u00a0Democratic strategists worried that Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 campaign could suffer the same fate as Clinton\u2019s. The similarities between the two candidates are hard to dismiss: both are\u00a0establishment favorites, both are Obama administration\u00a0alums, and both are tainted by accusations that they used their authority as government officials to benefit their family to the potential detriment of U.S. foreign policy. Biden currently leads in the polls among the Democratic 2020 contenders. A Hill-HarrisX poll released Monday shows Biden with a commanding 32-point lead over his closest competitor, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. The former vice president led the poll at 46 percent, followed by Sanders at 17 percent; South Bend, Indiana, mayor Peter Buttigieg at 8 percent; and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren at 7 percent.

      "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
      "content": " The letter was reported by\u00a0New York Times media reporter Michael Grynbaum:  The letter states, in part (original emphasis): We are writing today with grave concern that you continue to book Rudy Giuliani on your air to spread false, debunked conspiracy theories on behalf of Donald Trump. While you often fat check his statements in real time during your discussions, that is no longer enough. By giving him your air time, you are allowing him to introduce increasingly unhinged, unfounded and desperate lies into the national conversation. We write to demand that in service to the fact, you no longer book Rudy Giuliani, a surrogate for Donald Trump who has demonstrated that he will knowingly and willingly lie in order to advance his own narrative. (The Biden campaign itself has been known to lie: the former vice president continues to repeat the Charlottesville \u201cvery fine people\u201d hoax after being confronted about it at the Iowa State Fair by Breitbart News, for example.) The statement goes on to claim that Giuliani\u2019s claims about potential corruption by Hunter Biden in Ukraine are \u201ccompletely baseless.\u201d Giuliani serves as a personal lawyer for President Donald Trump, and has been involved in investigating Hunter Biden\u2019s overseas business interests, which he developed while his father was in office. The former vice president pressured Ukraine to fire a prosecutor who was investigating Burma Holdings, an oil and gas company on whose board Hunter Biden sat at the time \u2014 a clear conflict of interest that Joe Biden has never explained. Biden\u2019s attempt to silence the opposition \u2014 and the media \u2014 is virtually unprecedented in the history of American politics. Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

Biden favors a \u201cliving Constitution\u201d approach that interprets the Constitution and the law through a \u201cpenumbra\u201d of rights beyond those actually provided in the text. Biden was addressing an audience of about 400 in a local gymnasium to close out his two-day swing through the Palmetto State. He began with his usual stump speech, claiming that President Trump had called neo-Nazis \u201cvery fine people\u201d in \u201cCharlotte\u201d (he meant Charlottesville). In reality, Trump said the neo-Nazis should be \u201ccondemned totally.\u201d Biden added that there was a \u201cdirect line\u201d between Trump\u2019s rhetoric on immigration and the mass shooting in El Paso, Texas, earlier this month. He cited the shooter\u2019s manifesto \u2014 without noting that the shooter said he was\u00a0not inspired by Trump. Among other attacks, Biden also claimed that President Trump was abusing executive power, and pledged to restore constitutional checks and balances. Biden did not mention that all of President Barack Obama\u2019s major achievements after Obamacare were undertaken through executive actions \u2014 such as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), the Iran deal, and the Paris Climate Accords \u2014 often circumventing Congress and directly contravening congressional will. At one point in Biden\u2019s attack on the president\u2019s immigration policies, a pro-Trump heckler shouted from the back: \u201cBest president we\u2019ve ever had!\u201d He and a woman he was with were confronted by security, and escorted out. One Biden supporter tore off the heckler\u2019s hat, though he later retrieved it from the floor. Reporters later shouted questions at Biden about a\u00a0Washington Post story Thursday that accused him of telling a \u201cmoving but false war story\u201d on the campaign trail. He ignored the media and left the venue. The former vice president is leading the state polls by a wide margin, thanks partly to his overwhelming support in the African-American community. He focused his attention on the Upstate area, speaking in Greenville, Spartanburg, Rock Hill, and Gaffney. Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

      "author": "Haris Alic",
      "content": " Biden, whose penchant for\u00a0confusing\u00a0times\u00a0and\u00a0places\u00a0has\u00a0drawn\u00a0worried\u00a0whispers from even the staunchest of allies, told a heart wrenching story last Friday about being asked to pin a medal on a reluctant Navy officer. The story, which Biden told to more than 400 voters in Hanover, New Hampshire, quickly made an impact upon everyone in the room. \u201cA four-star general had asked the then-vice president to travel to Kunar province in Afghanistan, a dangerous foray into \u2018godforsaken country\u2019 to recognize the remarkable heroism of a Navy captain,\u201d the Washington\u00a0Post reported on Thursday. \u201cSome told him it was too risky, but Biden said he brushed off their concerns.\u201d \u201cWe can lose a vice president,\u201d Biden claimed to have said when asked to make the trip. \u201cWe can\u2019t lose many more of these kids. Not a joke.\u201d As Biden recollected, the Navy captain \u201crappelled down a 60-foot ravine under fire and retrieved the body of an American comrade, carrying him on his back.\u201d When the captain\u2019s superiors wanted to honor his bravery with a \u201cSilver Star,\u201d the officer refused as it \u201cfelt like a failure\u201d because his comrade had died. \u201cHe said, \u2018Sir, I don\u2019t want the damn thing!\u2019\u201d said Biden, his \u201cjaw clenched\u201d and \u201cvoice rising to a shout,\u201d according to the Post.\u00a0\u201c\u2019Do not pin it on me, Sir! Please, Sir. Do not do that! He died. He died!\u2019\u201d The raw emotion Biden exhibited when telling the harrowing story of bravery and loss left those in attendance \u201csilent.\u201d \u201cThis is the God\u2019s truth,\u201d the former vice president added. \u201cMy word as a Biden.\u201d The only problem, as the Post reported, was that \u201calmost every detail in the story appears to be incorrect.\u201d: Biden visited Kunar province in 2008 as a U.S. senator, not as vice president. The service member who performed the celebrated rescue that Biden described was a 20-year-old Army specialist, not a much older Navy captain. And that soldier, Kyle J. White, never had a Silver Star, or any other medal, pinned on him by Biden. At a White House ceremony six years after Biden\u2019s visit, White stood at attention as President Barack Obama placed a Medal of Honor, the nation\u2019s highest award for valor, around his neck. Upon further investigation, the paper concluded that Biden had conflated three separate stories, including one in which he actually \u201cdid pin a medal on a heartbroken soldier, Army Staff Sgt. Chad Workman, who didn\u2019t believe he deserved the award.\u201d \u201cIn the space of three minutes, Biden got the time period, the location, the heroic act, the type of medal, the military branch and the rank of the recipient wrong, as well as his own role in the ceremony,\u201d the Post elaborated. The story and its inaccuracies come to light as Biden\u2019s campaign is besieged by doubts over his fitness for the presidency after a string of perplexing gaffes. In particular, the former vice president has shown difficulty remembering specific events, locations, and individuals during public appearances. When campaigning in South Carolina on Wednesday, Biden appeared to forget the name of his former runningmate, President Barack Obama. \u201cThey invaded a significant portion of another country and annexed a significant portion of it called Crimea,\u201d Biden said when discussing Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. \u201cHe\u2019s saying it was President \u2014 my boss \u2014 it was his fault.\u201d Such lapses have become more frequent in recent weeks, with Biden at one point even claiming he was vice president during the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland Florida. \u201cThose kids in Parkland came up to see me when I was vice president,\u201d Biden said earlier this month, before claiming that when the survivors visited Congress, lawmakers were \u201cbasically cowering, not wanting to see them. They did not want to face it on camera.\u201d Many were quick to point out that the tragic shooting, which resulted in 17 fatalities and over a dozen injuries, actually occurred on February 14, 2018 \u2014 more than a year after Biden left office. In response to such questionable conduct, an increasing number of individuals on the left have begun raising concerns over Biden\u2019s capacity to serve as commander in chief. \u201cBiden and his team owe it to voters to put him on a real, rigorous public campaign schedule, like everyone else,\u201d Adam Jentleson, a one time top aide to former Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV), said recently. \u201cIf he can hack it, great. If not, better to know sooner rather than later,\u201d Jentleson added. \u201cKeeping him under wraps except for big events while trying to skate by is just sketchy.\u201d",

      "content": " During his rally in Minneapolis, Trump called out Biden for his alleged corruption schemes in Ukraine and China, where his son Hunter Biden was paid up to\u00a0$83,000 a month to sit on a Ukrainian energy company\u2019s board while his father was Vice President. Trump said: Two months after President Obama put Joe in charge of Ukraine policy \u2026 and the press will not write it. They say, \u2018In totally unsubstantiated charges\u2019 every time they talk about him, \u2018President Trump has said that his son walked away with a fortune, now you know that\u2019s a totally unsubstantiated charge.\u2019 Really? It\u2019s not unsubstantiated, it\u2019s a fact.\u201d \u201cJoe\u2019s son Hunter got thrown out of the Navy and then he became a genius on Wall Street in about two days,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBy the way, whatever happened to Hunter? Where the hell is he \u2026\u00a0Where\u2019s Hunter?\u201d Speaking directly to Hunter Biden, Trump said Biden was only a good Vice President because he sucked up to Obama. \u201cAnd your father was never considered smart, he was never considered a good Senator, he was only a good Vice President because he understood how to kiss Barack Obama\u2019s ass,\u201d Trump said to a roaring crowd. Trump noted Hunter Biden\u2019s deal with the Bank of China that provided him with a $1.5 billion check for his own private business dealings. \u201cAnd then they go to China \u2026 and Hunter, who\u2019s not too smart \u2026 he goes in, he has a meeting and walks out with $1.5 billion, billion with a B, $1.5 billion,\u201d Trump said. \u201cNow think of it, where\u2019s Hunter?\u201d \u201cHunter, you know nothing about energy, you know nothing about China, you know nothing about anything really. Hunter, you\u2019re a loser,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWhy did you get $1.5 billion, Hunter?\u201d As Breitbart News\u2019s Haris Alic\u00a0has reported, questions about why Hunter Biden was appointed to serve on the board of Ukrainian oil company\u00a0Burisma in April 2014 have plagued the former vice president\u2019s 2020 Democrat presidential primary bid. Breitbart News\u2019s Senior Contributor Peter Schweizer has detailed in his\u00a0book,\u00a0Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends, how Hunter Biden had no experience with the oil and gas industry or the nation of Ukraine before joining Burisma while his father was vice president.

The connection was revealed in author Peter Schweizer\u2019s best-selling book Secret Empires, and the reporting was confirmed in the New York Times. Hunter Biden was paid as much as $50,000 per month while serving on the board, as his father led the Obama administration\u2019s policy with Ukraine. Biden\u2019s \u201cnot a single bit of evidence\u201d defense echoes former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s repeated assertion that there was no evidence of improper paybacks after she approved the Uranium One deal \u2014 despite receiving $145 million in pledges and donations for the Clinton Foundation. Biden\u2019s Ukraine connection made recent headlines after President Donald Trump\u2019s personal attorney suggested he would travel to Ukraine to investigate the issue before ultimately deciding against it. Biden criticized Giuliani for even considering the idea. \u201cI can\u2019t remember any lawyer representing the president, conferring with the president, deciding to go overseas, where a government relies on U.S. largesse to try to get them to do something that everybody knows never happened,\u201d Biden said during an interview with WMUR. In the same interview, he also pointed to the reporting surrounding the conflict of interest. \u201cAll the reports indicated that not a single, solitary thing was inappropriate about what my son did. He never talked to me. He never talked to anybody in the administration,\u201d Biden said. In his interview with the Associated Press, Biden defended his son\u2019s role on the board. \u201cI have great confidence in my son,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s a man of great integrity.\u201d",

      "author": "Haris Alic",
      "content": " Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), a former chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, announced her endorsement of the former vice president on Tuesday,\u00a0claiming to have witnessed Biden\u2019s \u201cfortitude\u201d and leadership during their overlapping tenures in Congress. Feinstein said in a statement: I\u2019ve worked closely with Vice President Biden and I\u2019ve seen firsthand his legislative ability, his statesmanship, and most importantly his moral fortitud. During his time in Congress and in the White House, Joe Biden has been a tireless fighter for hard working American families. The endorsement comes as Biden\u2019s presidential campaign is besieged by scandal regarding the lucrative business dealings his youngest son, Hunter, had with foreign governments. Only hours before Feinstein\u2019s endorsement,\u00a0the Chinese government announced it would not investigate how Hunter Biden ended up at the center of one its top private equity firms. The Chinese foreign ministry made the decision after President Donald Trump publicly called for a probe of Hunter Biden\u2019s dealings with Bohai Harvest RST (BHR). In particular, Trump has noted that the circumstances surrounding BHR\u2019s creation could have posed a conflict of interest for Joe Biden. As Peter Schweizer, senior contributor at Breitbart News, revealed in his bestselling\u00a0book\u00a0Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends,\u00a0Hunter Biden inked the multibillion-dollar deal that created BHR with a subsidiary of the state-owned Bank of China in 2013. The timing of the lucrative deal has been brought into question as it came only 12 days after Hunter visited China with his father aboard Air Force Two.\u00a0Officially, the then-vice president was visiting the country amid escalating tensions over islands in the South China Sea and decided to bring his granddaughter and son along. In a March 2018\u00a0interview\u00a0with\u00a0Breitbart News Tonight, however, Schweizer detailed the political machinations that preceded Hunter Biden\u2019s $1.5 billion venture with China: In December of 2013, Vice President Joe Biden flies to Asia for a trip, and the centerpiece for that trip is a visit to Beijing, China. To put this into context, in 2013, the Chinese have just exerted air rights over the South Pacific, the South China Sea. They basically have said, \u2018If you want to fly in this area, you have to get Chinese approval. We are claiming sovereignty over this territory.\u2019 Highly controversial in Japan, in the Philippines, and in other countries. Joe Biden is supposed to be going there to confront the Chinese. Well, he gets widely criticized on that trip for going soft on China. For basically not challenging them, and Japan and other countries are quite upset about this. Since its creation, BHR has invested heavily in energy and defense projects across the globe. As of June,\u00a0Hunter Biden was still\u00a0involved\u00a0with BHR, sitting on its board of directors and owning a minority stake of the fund estimated to be worth more than $430,000. Such dealings at the center of politics and business, while perhaps not illegal, are not exclusive to the Biden family alone. As a few noted at the time of Feinstein\u2019s endorsement, the senator and her husband have their own close ties to the communist country. During her tenure as mayor of San Francisco in the late-1970s and early-1980s, Feinstein took advantage of the newly normalized diplomatic relations between the U.S. and China by establishing one of the first sister city partnership between San Francisco and Shanghai. Through that partnership, Feinstein led trade delegations to China in which she and her husband, Richard Blum, became acquainted with some of the country\u2019s most prominent political leaders. As the Federalist noted in August 2018, Feinstein and her husband leveraged those relationships to boost their own wealth. In 1986, Feinstein and Jiang Zemin \u2014 the then-mayor of Shanghai, who would later ascend to the presidency of the People\u2019s Republic of China \u2014 \u201cdesignated several corporate entities for fostering commercial relations.\u201d One of those firms was Shanghai Pacific Partners, which employed Blum as a director. Blum reportedly had an interest of upwards of $500,000 in a project backed by Shanghai Pacific Partners. After Feinstein was elected to the Senate in 1992, Blum continued profiting off their ties to China. A the same time, the freshman lawmaker was pitching herself as a \u201cChina hand\u201d to colleagues, even once claiming \u201cthat in my last life maybe I was Chinese.\u201d Through her seat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Feinstein led the fight on a number of initiatives seen as being favorable to China, including granting the country\u00a0permanent most-favored-nation trading status in 2000. Despite Feinstein and her husband having a close relationship with Jiang, the Chinese government targeted the senator as part of its espionage operations. In the early 2000s, the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS) recruited a longtime employee of the senator to gather information about the inner workings of her congressional and district offices. Feinstein only learned of the staffer\u2019s duplicity in 2013, after he\u2019d already been on her payroll for more than 20 years. \u201cWhile this person, who was a liaison to the local Chinese community, was fired, charges were never filed against him,\u201d Politico reported in 2018, speculating that because \u201cthe staffer was providing political intelligence and not classified information\u2014making prosecution far more difficult.\u201d Apart from the convoluted history of the senator\u2019s ties to China, the political timing of Feinstein\u2019s endorsement also caught many off guard.\u00a0The California Democrat, who hosted a fundraiser on Biden\u2019s behalf last week\u00a0alongside House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s (D-CA) daughter, is only the most recent figure from the Democrat establishment to openly pledge support for the former vice president. Feinstein\u2019s endorsement, however, was not totally expected, especially since her seamate, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), is mounting a bid of her own for the Democrat nomination. In fact, earlier this year, Feinsten flirted with the notion of remaining neutral in the 2020 contest out of respect for Harris. Compounding the political picture is that most polls show Biden no longer the favorite to win California, having fallen behind Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). Feinstein, however, did not address any of that when endorsing the former vice president on Tuesday. Instead, the senator offered platitudes about Biden\u2019s work to enhance gun control and how his campaign was a \u201cfight to restore the soul of the nation.\u201d",

      "subtitle": "Former Vice President and leading 2020 Democrat presidential candidate Joe Biden is vowing to greatly increase the number of legal immigrants admitted to the United States every year.",
      "author": "John Binder",
      "content": " In a speech to the Asian and Latino Coalition PAC, Biden promised to increase the level of legal immigration to the country beyond the roughly 1.2 million legal immigrants that are admitted every year, booming the foreign-born population to an unprecedented 45 million \u2014 a 108-year record high. Specifically, Biden said the U.S. can \u201cin a heartbeat\u201d import another two million immigrants today. Biden said: We could afford to take in a heartbeat another two million people. The idea that a country of 330 million people is cannot absorb people who are in desperate need \u2026 is absolutely bizarre \u2026\u00a0I would also move to increase the total number of immigrants able to come to the United States. [Emphasis added] In addition to an increase in legal immigration levels, Biden said his national immigration plan would ensure that all 11 to 22 million illegal aliens living across the U.S. receive amnesty and a pathway to American citizenship. Likewise, Biden said it is \u201cimmigration\u201d that has \u201cbuilt this country,\u201d reiterating the claim that the U.S. is a \u201cnation of immigrants,\u201d calling it \u201ca fact.\u201d Biden\u2019s comments come after the latest Harvard/Harris Poll finds that swing voters by a majority, as well as nearly every other demographic group, say they are less likely to support a 2020 presidential candidate who wants more illegal and legal immigration to the U.S. Currently, the nation\u2019s\u00a0Washington, DC-imposed\u00a0mass legal and illegal immigration policy \u2014 whereby at least 1.5 million unskilled foreign nationals are admitted to the U.S. every year \u2014 is a boon to corporate executives, Wall Street, big business, and multinational corporations, as\u00a0America\u2019s working and middle class have their\u00a0wealth redistributed\u00a0to the country\u2019s\u00a0top earners\u00a0through wage stagnation. Research by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine has discovered that immigration to the country shifts about $500 billion in wages away from working and middle-class Americans toward new arrivals and economic elites. Similarly, research by Steven Camarotta has found that every one percent increase in the immigrant composition of an occupation\u2019s labor force\u00a0reduces\u00a0Americans\u2019 hourly wages by 0.4 percent. Every one percent increase in the immigrant workforce reduces Americans\u2019 overall wages by 0.8 percent. In the last decade alone, the U.S. has\u00a0admitted\u00a0ten million legal immigrants, forcing American workers to compete against a growing population of low-wage foreign workers. Meanwhile, if legal immigration continues, there will be\u00a069 million foreign-born\u00a0residents living in the U.S. by 2060 and a total population of more than 404 million residents.

      "author": "Haris Alic",
      "content": " The tense altercation occurred during a campaign stop in Los Angeles, California, where the former vice president was asked if Hunter Biden\u2019s service on the board of directors of Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian oil and gas giant, had posed a conflict of interest during his time in the White House. Biden, who in the past had refused to discuss his son\u2019s business dealings with foreign governments, appeared perturbed by the question. \u201cIt\u2019s not a conflict of interest,\u201d the former vice president said. \u201cThere\u2019s been no indication of any conflict of interest, from Ukraine or anywhere else, period. I\u2019m not going to respond to that.\u201d  The question regarding the potential conflict of interest came only hours after the newly appointed Ukrainian Prosecutor General\u00a0 announced he was reviewing allegations of criminal conduct against Burisma. Hunter\u00a0Biden joined the company\u2019s board of directors in April 2014, despitehaving no prior background in either the energy industry or Ukraine. As Peter Schweizer, senior contributor at Breitbart News, detailed in his\u00a0book\u00a0\u00a0Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friend,\u00a0Hunter Biden secured the position, which paid as much as\u00a0$83,000 per month, around the same time his father was tapped to lead the Obama administration\u2019s policy in Ukraine. The timing of Hunter Biden\u2019s ascension to Burisma\u2019s board\u00a0immediately raised questions from ethics watchdogs in both the U.S. and Europe concerning conflicts of interest. Adding to the ethical cloud over that appointment was that Mykola Zlochevsky, Burisma\u2019s founder,\u00a0had his assets\u00a0seized\u00a0in the United Kingdom for suspicion of money laundering. Many have speculated Hunter Biden\u2019s position on Burisma\u2019s board was an attempt by Zlochevsky to curry favor with western leaders to prevent further scrutiny of his business dealings. Such a brazen attempt would not be totally ill-suited for Zlochevsky. The Burisma founder is rumored to be one of eastern Europe\u2019s top oligarchs, a position obtained while serving in the Ukrainian government under former President\u00a0Viktor\u00a0Yanukovych \u2014 a staunch ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin. It was during his tenure in government as Ukraine\u2019s minister of natural resources that Burisma\u00a0received\u00a0its oil and gas licenses. It is in the context of Burisma and Zlochevsky\u2019s legal troubles that Joe Biden\u2019s political influence has raised the most red flags. The former vice president has particularly drawn questions over his conduct in demanding the Ukrainian government fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, in 2016. Biden, who has publicly\u00a0bragged\u00a0about the firing, reportedly threatened to withhold more than one billion dollars in U.S. aid if the Ukrainian government did not remove Shokin. He has claimed the demand came from then-President Barack Obama, who had allegedly lost faith in the prosecutor\u2019s ability to tackle corruption. Unofficially, though, it was well known Shokin was investigating both Burisma and Zlochevsky for public corruption. It is uncertain if the probe extended to Hunter Biden, although Shokin has recently admitted that prior to his ouster, he was warned to\u00a0back off\u00a0of the matter. Regardless of what occurred, Shokin\u2019s successor dropped the investigation into Burisma and Zlochevsky Since President Donald Trump suggested the matter be looked into by Ukraine, an action that\u00a0launched\u00a0an impeachment inquiry by the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives, Biden has worked to minimize his role in the entire proceeding. Part of that strategy has been to pivot the conversation away from Hunter Biden and Burisma by accusing Trump of abusing his power in suggesting Ukraine probe the issue. \u201cLet\u2019s focus on the problem, focus on this man, what he\u2019s doing, that no president has ever done,\u201d Biden told the media on Friday.",

A former Trump administration official also spoke with the\u00a0Washington Examiner and claimed Biden\u2019s work on foreign affairs put him in the whistleblower\u2019s circle either at the CIA or at the White House. \u201cThis person, after working with Biden, may feel defensive towards him because he feels [Biden] is being falsely attacked. Maybe he is even talking to Biden\u2019s staff,\u201d the former Trump administration official stated. \u201cMaybe it is innocent, maybe not.\u201d \u201cThe Whistleblower\u2019s facts have been so incorrect about my \u2018no pressure\u2019 conversation with the Ukrainian President, and now the conflict of interest and involvement with a Democrat Candidate, that he or she should be exposed and questioned properly,\u201d President Donald Trump wrote Wednesday on Twitter.  In a statement to members of Congress, Michael Atkinson, the Intelligence Community\u2019s inspector general, said the whistleblower had a \u201cprofessional\u201d tie to a 2020 Democrat presidential hopeful. Atkinson also said the whistleblower\u2019s complaint shows \u201csome indicia of an arguable political bias \u2026 in favor of a rival political candidate.\u201d Follow Kyle on Twitter @RealKyleMorris and Facebook.",

Female Secret Service agents find that offensive.\u201d He added, \u201cBecause of Biden\u2019s lack of consideration as evidenced by that habit and his refusal to give agents advance notice of his trips back home, being assigned to his detail is considered the second worst assignment in the Secret Service after being assigned to protect Hillary Clinton.\u201d One agent told Kessler, \u201cBiden likes to be revered as everyday Joe, and that\u2019s his thing. But the reality is no agents want to go on his detail because Biden makes agents\u2019 lives so tough.\u201d Kessler elaborated further in a television interview. \u201cBiden likes to swim nude both at his Vice President\u2019s residence in Washington and also at his home in Wilmington which he goes back to several times a week \u2026 and this offends female Secret Service agents,\u201d he told Fox News\u2019s Sean Hannity. \u201cThey signed up to take a bullet for the President as you said but they didn\u2019t sign up to \u2014 they certainly didn\u2019t sign up to see Biden naked. It is offensive, it\u2019s abusive.\u201d Who would do such a thing? This is like hiring a maid and walking around the house nude because that\u2019s what you did before you hired the maid. There is nothing wrong with skinny-dipping \u2026 in private, and I can sympathize with those who lose their privacy when security is necessary. But no one forced Joe Biden to accept the role of vice president. He knew the deal going in, and to expose his naked body to female Secret Service agents is not only disrespectful and arrogant, it reeks of a perverse exploitation and abuse of power. Naturally, the fake establishment media ignored the story at the time, just as they are now ignoring and even excusing Biden\u2019s well-documented and very creepy predilection for inappropriately touching young women and children. Two women have already come forward to accuse Biden of inappropriately touching them, and there are countless photos and video clips of Biden creeping out women and children with unwanted touching, nuzzling, and kissing. But media elitists\u00a0such as Meghan McCain, Mika Brzezinski, and Alyssa Milano still defend him. But this has nothing to do with principle on their part. We all know that if even one video existed of President Trump, Clarence Thomas, or Brett Kavanaugh doing this\u2026  \u2026or this\u2026  or any of this\u2026 \u2026it would be all over and everyone knows it. Hey, if the media want to fly cover for Creepy Joe now, that\u2019s fine with me. I would much rather this be litigated during the general election.  Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

Biden also claimed that President Trump\u2019s withdrawing most U.S. forces in Syria in the advance of a Turkish offensive is \u201cthe most shameful thing that any president has done in modern history\u201d in terms of foreign policy \u2014 glossing over the 2003 Iraq War and his own support for it. The Iraq War led to more than 4,500 U.S. forces dead and tens of thousands more wounded. Also, it was executed by President George W. Bush and supported by Biden. Biden later claimed he was immediately against the Iraq War after voting to authorize it in 2002, but FactCheck.org showed that it was three years before he began opposing it. While he was vice president in 2011, the Obama administration also withdrew all U.S. forces from Iraq, which created a vacuum for the rise of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). The Obama administration also did not support moderate Syrian protesters before the Syrian civil war began, which prompted some to turn to Islamist groups for help, fueling the civil war and ISIS\u2019s numbers in Syria. The Syrian civil war has led to hundreds of thousands of Syrians killed, about eight million Syrians displaced from their homes, a refugee crisis, and terrorist attacks in Europe. Despite this, Biden touted his foreign policy record, stating that \u201cour commanders across the board, former and present, are ashamed.\u201d Actually, only retired commanders \u2014 some of whom worked for the Obama administration \u2014 have expressed shame. He said, \u201cAnd the fact of the matter is, I\u2019ve never seen a time \u2014 and I\u2019ve spent thousands of hours in the Situation Room, I\u2019ve spent many hours on the ground in those very places, in Syria and in Iraq, and guess what? Our commanders across the board, former and present, are ashamed of what\u2019s happening here.\u201d Furthermore, he stated that he would make it clear to Assad that \u201che\u2019s going to have a problem\u201d with Turkey and tell Turkey it will pay a \u201cheavy price\u201d for invading Syria. (Trump has already threatened to tank Turkey\u2019s economy and imposed sanctions.) Biden also said he would want U.S. troops to be protected by air cover (which they are as they withdraw from Syria) but said he would \u201cmake it clear that they\u2019re not going anywhere.\u201d \u201cI would want those thousand troops to be protected by air cover, those thousand troops that are being \u2014 having to withdraw under fire, make it clear that they\u2019re not going anywhere and have them protected and work my way back toward what, in fact, needs to be done, protecting those Kurds.

      "subtitle": "Joe Biden\u2019s top political donors gathered for an emergency closed-door meeting this weekend in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, as his campaign falls behind rivals in both funds and polling.",
      "author": "Haris Alic",
      "content": " The New York Times\u00a0was first to report the meeting on Sunday, noting the financiers were treated to a behind-the-scenes view of the campaign\u2019s headquarters and strategy, including a private address by the former vice president. \u201cIn a sign of the attendees\u2019 significant financial firepower, Mr. Biden himself addressed the several dozen donors who came to the retreat on Saturday, rallying them for 45 minutes about the months ahead, people there said,\u201d the Times reported. \u201cThe campaign kept the session with Mr. Biden behind closed doors, despite pledging to open them to the press.\u201d The meeting comes as the campaign is besieged by questions over Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings in Ukraine as well as polls showing the former vice president is no longer the frontrunner among 2020 Democrats. Biden, who once led the field by\u00a0as much 26 percentage points, now trails Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) in the early states of Iowa and New Hampshire. Adding to the campaign\u2019s trouble is the fact that their fundraising numbers were eclipsed this quarter not only by Warren but also Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-VT) and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg \u2014 who polled significantly below the former vice president. Biden\u2019s mounting problems and the emergence of Warren as the most direct threat was not far from the minds of those gathered in attendance in Philadelphia. \u201cWe need him to get the nomination because he\u2019s the one who can win,\u201d Denise Bauer, a Biden bundler and former ambassador to Belgium, told the Times. To stress the point, she added that the former vice president\u2019s donors were \u201cgoing to try to raise every single dollar we can.\u201d It is unclear if such efforts will be successful enough to\u00a0save the 76-year-old Biden\u2019s third White House bid. Unlike Warren or Sanders, the former vice president\u2019s fundraising has failed to diversify past the top-dollar level.\u00a0According to the Center for Responsive Politics, more than\u00a02,800 donors\u00a0have already maxed out to Biden\u2019s campaign since his announcement in late April. Top-dollar donors make up a far higher percentage of Biden\u2019s campaign\u2019s coffers than those of his competitors. In comparison, only 38 percent of the campaign\u2019s funds to date have come from individuals donating less than $200. Such a ratio poses an issue for the former vice president, especially now that his top contributors are prohibited by law from donating again until after he\u2019s secured the nomination.\u00a0David Kochel, the former chief strategist for Jeb Bush\u2019s failed 2016 presidential bid, explained the problem to Politico on Friday. If you don\u2019t have that perpetual, low-dollar fundraising machine, you can\u2019t compete,\u201d Kochel said. \u201cBiden looks like he can\u2019t compete with Warren, Bernie and Buttigieg. How\u2019s he going to compete with Trump?\u201d Despite Biden\u2019s money woes, the former vice president is also facing scrutiny over his son\u2019s shadowy ties to foreign governments, which\u00a0have taken center stage in the battle to impeach President Donald Trump. The controversy started last month when Trump\u00a0suggested\u00a0the Ukrainian government probe Hunter Biden\u2019s role with Burisma Holdings. The younger Biden joined the Ukrainian oil and gas giant in 2014 around the same time his father was appointed to oversee Obama administration policy in the region. As Peter Schweizer, senior contributor at Breitbart News, detailed in his book\u00a0Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends, Hunter Biden secured the position, which paid as much as\u00a0$83,000 per month despite having no background in the energy industry or Ukraine. Hunter Biden\u2019s lack of experience, coupled with his father\u2019s influence over Ukraine,\u00a0immediately raised questions from ethics watchdogs in both the U.S. and Europe about a conflict of interest. Furthering the ethical cloud over the appointment is that it came during the same month that\u00a0Mykola Zlochevsky, Burisma\u2019s founder,\u00a0had his assets\u00a0seized\u00a0in the United Kingdom for suspicion of money laundering. Some have speculated Hunter Biden\u2019s ascension to Burisma\u2019s board was an attempt by Zlochevsky to curry favor with western leaders to prevent further scrutiny of his business dealings. A brazen attempt would not be totally ill-suited for Zlochevsky. The Burisma founder is rumored to be one of eastern Europe\u2019s top oligarchs, a position obtained while serving in the Ukrainian government under former President\u00a0Viktor\u00a0Yanukovych \u2014 a staunch ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin. It was during his tenure in government as Ukraine\u2019s minister of natural resources that Burisma\u00a0received\u00a0its oil and gas licenses. It is in the context of Burisma and Zlochevsky\u2019s legal troubles that Joe Biden\u2019s political influence has raised the most red flags. The former vice president has particularly drawn questions over his conduct in demanding the Ukrainian government fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, in 2016. Biden, who has publicly\u00a0bragged\u00a0about the firing, reportedly threatened to withhold more than one billion dollars in U.S. aid if the Ukrainian government did not remove Shokin. He has claimed the demand came from then-President Barack Obama, who had allegedly lost faith in the prosecutor\u2019s ability to tackle corruption. Unofficially, though, it was known that Shokin was investigating both Burisma and Zlochevsky for public corruption. It is uncertain if the probe extended to Hunter Biden, although Shokin has recently admitted that prior to his ouster he was warned to back off the matter. Regardless of what occurred, Shokin\u2019s successor dropped the investigation into Burisma and Zlochevsky, allowing the oligarch to return to the country after having\u00a0fled\u00a0in 2014. Biden, for his part, has refused to discuss the matter, even lashing out at the media for asking if his son\u2019s work with Burisma posed a conflict of interest during his tenure in the vice presidency. The tactic, however, does not seem to be doing Biden or his campaign any favors. A new poll released on Friday indicates that 57 percent of Americans support the Department of Justice opening an investigation into Hunter Biden\u2019s work abroad. Some of the donors gathered in Philadelphia this weekend, though, saw the issues surrounding Hunter Biden and Ukraine in a different light. Sheila Nix, who once served as chief of staff to Dr. Jill Biden, told the Times\u00a0the former vice president\u2019s struggles were the result of him having to run two campaigns at once. \u201cHe\u2019s running a primary campaign and a general at the same time and I think he\u2019s doing a great job,\u201d Nix said. \u201cIt\u2019s a little unprecedented having to do both at the same time.\u201d",

      "author": "John Nolte",
      "content": " Naturally, the outlet also attacks President Trump over his own Vietnam-era deferment, but comparing Trump to Biden in this regard, as you will see, is like comparing a gun to a tomato. According the report, after he graduated college in 1968, Biden became eligible for the draft, which could have landed him in combat in Vietnam. What saved him, what earned him a 1-Y draft deferment, was asthma\u2026 Asthma, y\u2019all. Asthma. Don\u2019t get me wrong, asthma can be debilitating. Chronic asthma is the worst; it can disable a person. If Biden legitimately suffered a serious asthma problem, his draft deferment is perfectly legitimate. Here\u2019s the problem, though\u2026 While Biden was scoring a deferment for \u201casthma as a teenager,\u201d he was \u2014 get this \u2014 also scoring touchdowns as a teenager. Biden played football in high school and once went so far as to lie about playing football for the University of Delaware \u2014 even though he didn\u2019t, but Biden is the kind of liar who lies about such things. What\u2019s more, InsideSources points out that in his autobiography, Biden makes no mention of asthma, but brags about being \u201cactive in intramural sports\u201d while in college, and \u201crecounts an active childhood [and] football exploits in high school.\u201d Worse still, during one summer home from college, as Biden himself has admitted, he worked as a lifeguard, which requires vigorous health in order to pass that test, including a very healthy set of lungs. And then there\u2019s this: One incident from that summer stands out: How Biden had to wrap a six-foot length of metal chain around his arm to face off against a knife-wielding local tough who went by the name \u201cCorn Pop.\u201d \u201cYou might cut me, Corn Pop, but I\u2019m going to wrap this chain around your head before you do,\u201d Biden told him. Strong words, but he was a healthy, high school football player who could back them up. Biden and Corn Pop resolved their differences without violence and, according to Biden, became poolside friends. Just six years later, at the height of the fighting in Vietnam, that same poolside athlete avoided mandatory military service due to \u201casthma as a teenager.\u201d \u2026\u201dasthma as a teenager.\u201d Yep, healthy enough to play football and qualify as a lifeguard, which is no easy task, but still 1-Y when swimming is one of the most strenuous exercises around. Trump haters can laugh all they want at Trump\u2019s \u201cbone spurs,\u201d the reason behind his 1-Y classification, but snickers and cheap shots don\u2019t contradict a bone spur diagnosis. It\u2019s not like Trump was out running marathons at the time. But there was Slow Joe playing football in high school, playing even more sports in college, and qualifying as a lifeguard, all while claiming to suffer the debilitating asthma that meant someone else would have to take his place in Vietnam. Back in 2008, while he was running for vice president, it was reported that Biden received a total of\u00a0five deferments for asthma. Naturally, the same media that crucified then-Vice President Dick Cheney for his five deferments didn\u2019t care about Biden\u2019s deferments. And we all know why: The media were desperate to make Obama president. After all, why would a media that didn\u2019t care about Obama\u2019s 20 years in a racist church, his associations with domestic terrorists and Louis Farrakhan, care about Biden\u2019s asthma? This time will be different. Biden is running for president, the establishment media see a whole bunch of extreme left-wingers they would like to see beat Biden, and since the dark days of 2008 when the fake news media still held all the levers of information, a whole new media infrastructure has been erected. In other words, we have not heard the last of this, not by a long shot.  Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC. Follow his Facebook Page here.",

      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " He cautioned ahead of Tuesday evening\u2019s debate that Democrat candidates need to tell voters how they will practically implement their lofty policy proposals. Bloomberg wrote an op-ed for the Washington Post\u00a0urging Democrat candidates to explain how they would make their grandiose proposals a reality. The former mayor said it is likely the next president will face a \u201cclosely\u00a0divided Congress.\u201d Because of that, candidates need to explain how they would implement their ideas \u2013 such as Medicare for All and their multi-trillion-dollar Green New Deal proposals. \u201cRarely are the candidates asked, and more rarely still do they talk about, how they would go about achieving their goals,\u201d Bloomberg wrote. \u201cThe fact is: A legislative proposal is only as good as the execution plan that accompanies it. And even the best plans must be flexible enough to accommodate necessary changes, to prevent the perfect from being the enemy of the good,\u201d he continued. He added: The presidential aspirants are not short on big ideas. But voters must demand they explain how they intend to move from proposing plans to actually implementing them, including passing them through Congress. Those who dodge the question by speaking of revolution and the bully pulpit aren\u2019t up to the job. The op-ed follows reports of\u00a0Bloomberg\u2019s rumored reconsideration of a presidential bid. While he announced his intention of staying out of the presidential race due to the \u201cdifficulty of winning the Democratic nomination in such a crowded field\u201d in March, Biden\u2019s slow and steady fall has the former mayor rethinking his decision. Bloomberg has told associates that he is considering throwing his hat in the presidential ring of Biden drops out. \u201cBloomberg is in if Biden is out,\u201d a source, described as a \u201cNew York billionaire with ties to Bloomberg,\u201d told CNBC. As CNBC reported: Bloomberg has signaled he\u2019s \u201cstill looking at\u201d running for president, but people close him say that the only way he could even go down that path is if Biden\u2019s fortunes suffer so much that he drops out before or during the early stages of the primary. Bloomberg could then enter the race as one of the rare moderates with enough name recognition and campaign funding to make a run. Forbes estimates his net worth at $51 billion, and\u00a0he was planning to spend over $100 million on a campaign for president if he ran. While Biden has not signaled any intention to drop out of the race, his lackluster debate performance is not expected to elevate his position in the polls. The former vice president failed to have a breakout moment during the three-hour debate and experienced at least seven gaffes,\u00a0mistakenly pronouncing exponentially as \u201cexpodentially,\u201d mentioning Roe. v Wade before correcting himself to the subject of gun sales, and claiming that people are \u201cclipping coupons in the stock market\u201d during a discussion on the economy:  If Bloomberg does, in fact, jump into the presidential ring in coming months, he would likely face questions surrounding his recent praise of China\u2013 particularly that Chinese Communist Party chairman Xi Jinping is \u201cnot a dictator\u201d:  ",

This president on three occasions, three occasions, has invited foreign governments and heads of government to get engaged in trying to alter our elections. The fact is that it is outrageous. Rudy Giuliani, the president and his thugs have already proven that they, in fact, are flat lying. What we have to do now is focus on Donald Trump. He doesn\u2019t want me to be the candidate. He is going after me because he knows if I get the nomination, I will beat him like a drum.\u201d In his attempt to recap Biden\u2019s meandering answer, Noah said that he understood what Biden meant but that it\u00a0\u201ctook a while for him to get there.\u201d \u201cOK, one minute he\u2019s talking about his son, then George Washington, then something about the seventeenth?\u201d the Comedy Central host remarked. \u201cJoe Biden is the only candidate who remixes his speech while he\u2019s giving it.\u201d  After mocking the number of candidates on the debate stage,\u00a0\u00a0Noah also described the \u201cweirdest part of the night\u201d\u00a0 as when Kamala Harris (D-CA) \u201cstarted a real-life Twitter beef\u201d with Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) over\u00a0Twitter\u2019s refusal to ban Trump from its platform. \u201cI\u2019ll be honest, I kind of understand Warren\u2019s point here,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe need Trump on Twitter.

      "author": "John Nolte",
      "content": " So, uhm, what happened to the badass who took on Corn Pop? What happened to the tough guy who was going to beat President Trump like a drum? What happened to the sunglasses and swagger? I\u2019ll tell you what happened\u2026 Joe Biden got old. And I don\u2019t mean number-wise. While Clint Eastwood is still knocking them out of the park at age 89, Joe Biden\u2019s eye is exploding, his dentures are falling out, and now he\u2019s ranting and raving at the refs because he\u2019s losing the game. On Thursday, the far-left New York Times published an op-ed written by Breitbart\u2019s own Peter Schweizer, author of the recent bestseller Secret Empires. In the piece, Schweizer uses Biden and Sen. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) as an example of why Congress must pass reforms closing the \u201cglaring loophole [that] provide political families with an opportunity to effectively \u2018offshore\u2019 corruption and cronyism.\u201d About Biden, Schweizer lays out the devastating facts: As vice president, Joe Biden served as point person on American policy toward China and Ukraine. In both instances, his son Hunter, a businessman, landed deals\u00a0he\u00a0was apparently\u00a0unqualified to\u00a0score save for one thing: his father. In December 2013, Joe and Hunter Biden\u00a0flew aboard Air Force Two to China; less than two weeks after the trip, Hunter\u2019s firm, Rosemont Seneca Partners, which he founded with two other businessmen in June 2013, finalized a deal to open a\u00a0fund, BHR Partners,\u00a0whose largest shareholder is the\u00a0government-run Bank of China, even though\u00a0he had scant background\u00a0in private equity.\u00a0(Representatives of the fund claim that the timing of the deal and the Bidens\u2019 trip to China was coincidental.)\u00a0Thus far, the firm\u00a0has invested about $2.1 billion,\u00a0according to its website. \u2026 With the Russian invasion of Crimea in 2014, Joe Biden became point person in Ukraine as well. That same year, Hunter Biden\u00a0landed a board position\u00a0with the Ukrainian energy giant Burisma Holdings. Despite having no background in energy or Ukraine, the vice president\u2019s son was paid\u00a0as much as\u00a0$50,000 a month, according to financial records. (He left the board in early 2019.) Why would someone with so little experience be able to command such enormous payments? Joe Biden recently claimed, \u201cI have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.\u201d But Hunter Biden admitted to The New Yorker\u00a0that on one occasion, they had in fact discussed his work for Burisma[.] Biden\u2019s response\u2026? He ran out on his front lawn, shook his fist at the sky, and started yelling at the Times. In a letter addressed to Times executive editor Dean Baquet, Biden\u2019s deputy campaign manager and comms director Kate Bedingfield freaked out. Here\u2019s a taste: What was especially troubling about the Times\u2019s active participation in this smear campaign is that prior to its reporting on the subject by Ken Vogel, this conspiracy had been relegated to the likes of Breitbart, Russian propaganda, and another conspiracy theorist, regular Hannity guest John Solomon. \u2026 Despite voluminous work done by the independent press and fact-checkers \u2014 including some by The Times \u2014 to refute the heinous conspiracy theory that Donald Trump attempted to bully Ukraine into propping-up for him, the paper ran an op-ed by none other than Peter Schweizer, making more malicious claims about the Biden family. This leaves us with a critical question: are you truly blind to what you got wrong in 2016, or are you deliberately continuing policies that distort reality for the sake of controversy and the clicks that accompany it? How sad is that? Biden tried to do the same with Facebook and Twitter after the Trump campaign started running ads about Biden and Ukraine. Twitter has so far said nothing. Facebook told Biden to go pound sand, as did the Times, which released a statement defending the Schweizer op-ed. But is this the behavior of a tough guy? Is this the behavior of a man or a mouse \u2014 a mouse with something to hide? If Biden was an actual tough guy, if he still had The Stuff to be president, he wouldn\u2019t be crybabying to the refs to stop the fight and declare him the winner. \u00a0If Biden were the swaggering badass he claims to be, he would be out there fighting, he\u2019d be sticking it right back to Trump. Most importantly, he would come out of hiding to address this scandal head on \u2014 you know, like a man. Nothing proves this Ukraine scandal is the real deal more than Biden\u2019s cowardice when it comes to addressing it. Even if a reporter is able to ask him a question about the ridiculous amount of money his son was paid by a Ukrainian energy company, Biden just freaks out. Instead of answering the question, he acts like the reporter just skipped in front of him in line at the Blue Plate Special \u2014 he starts screaming and crybabying about how the question isn\u2019t fair. Listen, if there were a legitimate reason Hunter Biden was paid $50,000 a month \u2014a month! \u2014 by this company, Biden would have already sat down for an extensive interview to lay it all out, or he would have called a press conference to answer all questions. Instead, he is hiding his son in some undisclosed location, when he should have Hunter doing the interview rounds in defense of his own business practices and honor. But Biden can\u2019t do that because there are no good answers, so the old man has been reduced to a big whiner, and like a spoiled child caught red-handed, he only has one option: temper tantrums where he screams, \u201cNo, you shut up!\u201d Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

      "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
      "content": " In a three-and-a-half minute YouTube video, Biden cited the August 2017 riots as his primary motivation for running against Trump, presenting a version of events that even a CNN contributor has declared to be fraudulent. After referring to the town\u2019s historic role \u2014 including Thomas Jefferson, a slave owner \u2014 he added,\u00a0\u201cCharlottesville is also home to a defining moment for this nation in the last few years,\u201d followed by footage of a neo-Nazi procession.  Biden noted that the neo-Nazis in Charlottesville were \u201cchanting the same antisemitic bile heard in the \u201930s.\u201d He then added that they were \u201cmet by a courageous group of Americans, and a violent clash ensured.\u201d (Among that \u201ccourageous group of Americans\u201d were left-wing Antifa extremists who specifically came to Charlottesville to cause violence, and whom even Nancy Pelosi later\u00a0condemned after they caused another riot.) Biden then cited the debunked \u201cvery fine people\u201d claim: And that\u2019s when we heard the words of the President of the United States that stunned the world and shocked the conscience of this nation. He said there were, quote, some \u201cvery fine people on both sides.\u201d Very fine people on both sides? With those words, the president of the United States assigned a moral equivalence between those spreading hate, and those with the courage to stand against it. And in that moment, I knew that the threat to this nation was unlike any I had every seen in my lifetime. What Biden said is completely untrue, as the transcript of Trump\u2019s press conference about Charlottesville shows. Trump was referring to protesters against the removal of a statue of Confederate general Robert E. Lee, as well as to non-violent left-wing protesters against racism, and specifically excluded the neo-Nazis from \u201cvery fine people\u201d (emphasis added): REPORTER: The neo-Nazis started this thing. They showed up in Charlottesville. TRUMP: Excuse me, they didn\u2019t put themselves down as neo-Nazis, and you had some very bad people in that group. But you also had people that were very fine people on both sides. You had people in that group \u2013 excuse me, excuse me. I saw the same pictures as you did. You had people in that group that were there to protest the taking down, of to them, a very, very important statue and the renaming of a park from Robert E. Lee to another name. REPORTER: George Washington and Robert E. Lee are not the same. TRUMP: Oh no, George Washington was a slave owner. Was George Washington a slave owner? So will George Washington now lose his status? Are we going to take down \u2013 excuse me. Are we going to take down, are we going to take down statues to George Washington? How about Thomas Jefferson? What do you think of Thomas Jefferson? You like him? Okay, good. Are we going to take down his statue? He was a major slave owner. Are we going to take down his statue? You know what? It\u2019s fine, you\u2019re changing history, you\u2019re changing culture, and you had people \u2013 and I\u2019m not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists, because they should be condemned totally \u2013 but you had many people in that group other than neo-Nazis and white nationalists, okay? And the press has treated them absolutely unfairly. Now, in the other group also, you had some fine people, but you also had troublemakers and you see them come with the black outfits and with the helmets and with the baseball bats \u2013 you had a lot of bad people in the other group too. Ironically, Biden has his own record of racism to confront. CNN recently exposed how Biden courted the support of segregationists in the 1970s in a campaign to resist \u201cbusing,\u201d the mandatory radical integration of schools. In 2007, Biden infamously called Barack Obama \u201cthe first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy\u201d when commenting on his candidacy (long before being invited to join the ticket). In 2012, on the campaign trail, he told a largely black audience that Republicans wanted \u201cto put y\u2019all back in chains.\u201d And since then, Biden has joined other Democrats in courting the support of racist and antisemite Al Sharpton. Biden continued his video by declaring: \u201cIf we give Donald Trump eight years in the White House, he will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation, who we are, and I cannot stand by and watch that happen.\u201d He also said Trump threatened \u201cour very democracy,\u201d an apparent reference to another recently-debunked hoax \u2014 namely, the false claim that Trump colluded with Russian efforts to interfere with the 2016 presidential election. The former vice president apparently planned to launch his campaign directly in Charlottesville this week, but local leaders objected because \u201csome residents [were] unhappy about the scene a tragedy the city would prefer to forget being used as a campaign launch backdrop,\u201d the\u00a0Washington Examiner reported. Some also \u201cviewed the move as disrespectful and capitalizing on the death of activist Heather Heyer, 32,\u201d who was murdered by a neo-Nazi there. It is unclear why Biden chose to run on a divisive racial hoax, even one that remains dogma among many on the left. Biden may feel vulnerable in a Democratic Party now dominated by identity politics. Indeed, the Associated Press reported Thursday that some \u201cwomen of color\u201d were \u201cfrustrated\u201d by his candidacy. Nevertheless, the fact that Biden is running on an inflammatory, fearful hoax invites questions about who is really trying to divide Americans. Joel B.

      "author": "Haris Alic",
      "content": " During the Democrat debate on Tuesday, Biden and his two main competitors, Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Bernie Sanders (D-VT), traded barbs about who was best prepared to be commander in chief and what sort of vision was required to defeat President Donald Trump. Warren, in particular, cited her tenure, pushing for creation of the CFPB as proof she knew how to use \u201cexecutive authority\u201d to further her political agenda. Biden, who earlier in the debate claimed to be the \u201conly\u00a0one on this stage that has gotten anything really big done,\u201d attempted to counter the argument by highlighting his own role in the creation of the CFPB. \u201cI agreed with the great job she did, and I went on the floor and got you votes. I got votes for that bill. I convinced people to vote for it,\u201d the former vice president said. \u201cSo let\u2019s get those things straight, too.\u201d Despite the rhetoric, however, official scheduling records from the Obama-era White House dispute Biden\u2019s claims of having rallied support for the legislation.\u00a0In fact, as the Intercept has\u00a0reported,\u00a0on the day of the passage of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act\u2014which created the CFPB\u2014the former vice president\u2019s schedule notes he was not on the floor of the U.S. Senate. Records show that on the day the bill passed by a vote of 60-39, Biden only had one meeting with a member of Congress\u2019s upper chamber, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC). It is unlikely, though, that Biden was attempting to sway Graham\u2019s vote on the bill because, at the time, the senator was one of the bill\u2019s leading opponents. Biden\u2019s schedule for the rest of the day shows meetings regarding issues such as Iraq and the then-stimulus spending program, but nothing about Dodd-Frank:  As the Intercept noted, not only is there scant evidence to back up Biden\u2019s claim of going to the \u201cfloor,\u201d but several of those involved in Dodd-Frank\u2019s passage also have no recollection of the former vice president playing a role. Former Rep. Brad Miller (D-NC), who helped author the bill, even went so far as to say he \u201ccannot recall ever hearing\u201d Biden\u2019s name mentioned as Dodd-Frank moved through Congress:  This is not the first time the former vice president has inflated his role in a particular event for political gain. As Breitbart News reported in August, Biden has repeatedly inflated his role in the civil rights movement of the 1960s.",

Maher then wondered if Biden has to \u201cgo away\u201d to avoid tainting the Democratic Party like former Senator Al Franken (D-MN) did. Maher said, \u201cJoe Biden has a little Ukraine problem too. He didn\u2019t answer that question too well, I thought, in the debate. He didn\u2019t own it. His son was getting 50 grand a month to do nothing in a field he knew nothing about. It\u2019s very swampy. My question is this: Al Franken had to go away for the Democrats. Because they said, well, we have to be like Caesar\u2019s wife on the #MeToo issue. We can\u2019t have any tainting on that, so that the Republicans can\u2019t say, oh, you guys are bad on that too. Doesn\u2019t the same apply to Ukraine and Joe Biden?\u201d Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter\u00a0@IanHanchett",

      "subtitle": "Many pundits joked that when former Vice President Joe Biden gave his final answer in the Democrat debate on Tuesday night in Westerville, Ohio, he missed an opportunity to tell the story of \u201cCorn Pop\u201d again.",
      "author": "Matthew Boyle",
      "content": " So the story from Biden goes, gangster \u201cCorn Pop\u201d represented a serious threat to Biden when he was a lifeguard at a community pool. Corn Pop, who actually was real, supposedly carried a straight razor and after an altercation with young lifeguard Biden threatened to meet him in the parking lot later\u2014so young Biden claims he threatened to wrap a chain around Corn Pop\u2019s head. The whole blowup was over Biden allegedly calling Corn Pop \u201cEsther,\u201d a derisive insult drawn from the swimmer Esther Williams that apparently was akin to calling the gangster a girl. But before things devolved into a razor-versus-chain race war in the parking lot later, Biden says he apologized to Corn Pop for the insult, which defused the situation\u2014and the incident has become part of Biden\u2019s political folklore storyline of being a grand negotiator who can calmly lead in tense political situations, especially those involving race. Though it seems an incredible story, Biden included it in his 2007 autobiography and it was a central part of a dedication ceremony at a Delaware public pool at which Biden spoke in 2017. The NAACP even confirmed the details of Corn Pop and his existence for those questioning it. So when moderator Anderson Cooper at the end of the CNN-New York Times debate on Tuesday night closed down the debate with a question about a unique and different friendship that has shaped their lives, one would have thought the moderators were teeing Biden up for a perfect Corn Pop moment. Cooper said: Last week, Ellen DeGeneres was criticized after she and former President George W. Bush were seen laughing together at a football game. Ellen defended their friendship, saying, we\u2019re all different and I think that we\u2019ve forgotten that that\u2019s OK that we\u2019re all different. So in that spirit, we\u2019d like you to tell us about a friendship that you\u2019ve had that would surprise us and what impact it\u2019s had on you and your beliefs. Cooper went to all 11 other candidates before getting to Biden, who closed it down at the end, giving Biden plenty of time to think about what he was going to say. Instead of telling the story of Corn Pop, Biden opted for a more conventional and boring answer, and one already used by several of the other candidates: He talked about his friendship with the late Sen. John McCain (R-AZ): This is reassuring in the fact that we\u2019re all acknowledging that we have to reach across the aisle, get things done. No other way to get anything done in this country. The two people maybe would surprise you the most were \u2014 he\u2019s been mentioned twice, but John McCain. John McCain worked for me when he worked in the Navy, and he was \u2014 he was my assigned to me to travel around the world. We became close friends. He became very close friends with my wife, Jill. Visited our home. He was there with his children. And on his death bed, he asked me to do his eulogy. John, I would say to John, \u2018John, you didn\u2019t see a war you never wanted to fight.\u2019 And he\u2019d say, \u2018You didn\u2019t see a problem you never wanted to solve.\u2019 But he was a great man of principle. He was honorable. He was honorable. Biden finished with typical talking points from his stump speech about why he\u2019s running for president\u2014nothing remarkable, nothing outstanding, and nothing memorable. Some pundits and observers on Twitter laughed about Biden leaving Corn Pop hanging in favor of the safer McCain story, mocking Biden for being unable to read the room.      While this is more of a lighthearted ribbing of Biden, in an unserious and comedic manner\u2014Corn Pop probably was not the right story anyway for the question\u2014it does illustrate a larger problem with the sliding campaign of the former Vice President. He again had no major memorable positive moments on a crowded debate stage for the fourth month in a row. Donald Trump, Jr., President Donald Trump\u2019s eldest son, mocked Biden\u2019s lackluster performance in a tweet by noting that, at least this time in the Ohio debate, Biden\u2019s teeth didn\u2019t nearly fall out\u2014as they almost did in the previous debate.  It seems cruel, but Biden\u2019s teeth did slip and nearly fall out of his mouth in a previous debate, and in a forum his eye exploded, bleeding on live television. Another candidate, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), suffered a heart attack less than two weeks before this debate, pushing health questions\u2013like whether any of these Democrats are actually healthy enough to run for and serve as president\u2013to the forefront of Americans\u2019 minds heading into Tuesday night. Moderators even asked several of the candidates about these concerns in Ohio\u2019s debate. This all comes as it has been revealed by just-released Federal Election Commission (FEC) campaign finance reports that Biden\u2019s campaign spent more than he raised in funds last quarter, and he keeps slipping in polls behind rivals Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and now lags in the fundraising race as well. The bigger story that broke during the debate news cycle in its immediate aftermath is Biden spent nearly $2 million more than he raised last quarter\u2014he raised $15.7 million and spent $17.6 million\u2014while he had less than $9 million cash on hand at the end of September. That puts him at less than Sanders\u2019 $33.7 million, less than Warren\u2019s $25.7 million, less than Mayor Pete Buttigieg\u2019s $23.4 million, and even less than the $10.5 million that the flaming-out Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) had.  At a burn rate like Biden\u2019s running, with not much gas in the tank, the former Vice President could be in some serious trouble in attempting to remain near the front of the pack. He\u2019s already lost his frontrunner status, as Warren has pulled ahead of him in most national polling and in almost every early and battleground state except in the South. CNN\u2019s Chris Cillizza called Biden\u2019s funding lapses a \u201cbombshell\u201d revelation multiple times in a post about the matter, writing that it represents a \u201cSIREN\u201d for Biden\u2019s campaign. Factor that together with burgeoning attacks on his son Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings from the White House and President Donald Trump, as well as a media beginning to be receptive to the criticisms, and Joe Biden has a tougher-than-ever road ahead. Hunter Biden\u2019s interview earlier on Tuesday on ABC did his father no favors by most accounts, and even CNN and JournoList founder Ezra Klein of Vox are now saying there is something to all the questions swirling around him and that Democrats need to be prepared to deal with this. CNN published a fact check after the debate contrasting Biden\u2019s claims he never discussed Hunter\u2019s business dealings with his son with Hunter\u2019s claims he did discuss them with his father.  Klein, meanwhile, laid out in a Vox article how Democrats are woefully unprepared on the Hunter Biden issue should Joe Biden win the nomination, urging Democrats to learn how to talk about it, even if they don\u2019t want to discuss the problems. Klein wrote: A few things are true about the Hunter Biden story. One is that there\u2019s no evidence Joe Biden did what Donald Trump has accused him of doing: pressuring Ukraine to fire a prosecutor to protect his son from investigation. But another is that Hunter Biden poses real problems for Joe Biden\u2019s campaign, and if Democrats pretend otherwise, they\u2019re making a mistake. Many Democrats consider raising the Hunter Biden question unfair to Joe Biden. Why should he have to answer for the legal actions of his adult son? But no one said politics was fair. And if Democrats avoid the issue, they can be certain Trump will not. Biden\u2019s vulnerability here needs to be tested in the primary, when Democrats have other choices, rather than in the general, when they won\u2019t. The debate moderators and other candidates barely touched on Hunter Biden during the debate, and only to brush it aside as a non-concern. But Hunter Biden is hardly the only of Joe Biden\u2019s problems after the debate on Tuesday. There was a particularly memorable moment where, towards the end of the night, both Sanders and Warren\u00a0 extracted a pound of flesh from Biden from the left\u2014significantly undermining his standing with Democrats. Cooper asked Biden to respond to the broad visions of big, bold change that Warren and Sanders respectively have been laying out: Vice President Biden, just on either side of you, Senator Warren is calling for big structural change. Senator Sanders is calling for a political revolution. Will their visions attract the kind of voters that the Democrats need to beat Donald Trump? Biden replied with a claim he is the only one who has gotten anything substantive actually \u201cdone\u201d in Washington: Well, I think their vision is attracting a lot of people, and I think a lot of what they have to say is really important. But, you know, Senator Warren said we can\u2019t be running any vague campaigns. We\u2019ve got to level with people. We\u2019ve got to level with people and tell them exactly what we\u2019re going to do, how we\u2019re going to get it done, and if you can get it done. I\u2019m going to say something that is probably going to offend some people here, but I\u2019m the only one on this stage that has gotten anything really big done, from the Violence Against Women Act to making sure that we pass the Affordable Care Act to being in a position where we, in fact, took almost a $90 billion act that kept us from going into a depression, making us \u2014 putting us in a position where I was able to end roe \u2014 excuse me, able to end the issue of gun sales in terms of assault weapons. And so the question is, who is best prepared? We all have good ideas. The question is, who is going to be able to get it done? How can you get it done? And I\u2019m not suggesting they can\u2019t, but I\u2019m suggesting that that\u2019s what we should look at. And part of that requires you not being vague. Tell people what it\u2019s going to cost, how you\u2019re going to do it, and why you\u2019re going to do it. That\u2019s the way to get it done. Presidents are supposed to be able to persuade. After a follow-up question from Cooper asking Biden to further specify exactly whom he said was being \u201cvague,\u201d he took a not-so-veiled shot at the Medicare-for-All vision put forward by Warren and Sanders. Biden said: Well, the senator said \u2014 she\u2019s being vague on the issue of \u2014 actually, both are being vague on the issue of Medicare for all. No, look, here\u2019s the deal. Come on. It costs $30 trillion. Guess what? That\u2019s over $3 trillion \u2014 it\u2019s more than the entire federal budget\u2026 If you eliminated the entire Pentagon, every single thing, plane, ship, troop, the buildings, everything, satellites, it would get you \u2014 it would pay for a total of four months. Four months. Where do you get the rest? Where does it come from? That opened Sanders up to decimate Biden for \u201cworking with Republicans\u201d to back endless wars in the Middle East and trade policies that hurt America\u2019s working class: Joe, you talked about working with Republicans and getting things done. But you know what you also got done? And I say this as a good friend. You got the disastrous war in Iraq done. You got a bankruptcy bill, which is hurting middle-class families all over this country. You got trade agreements, like NAFTA and PNTR, with China done, which have cost us 4 million jobs. Now, let\u2019s get to Medicare for all. Let\u2019s be honest. We spend twice as much per person as do the people of any other major country on Earth. And the answer is, if we have the guts that I would like to see the Democratic Party have that guts, to stand up to the drug companies and the insurance companies and tell them that the function of health care is to guarantee care to all people, not to make $100 billion in profit. After back-and-forth between Biden and Sanders in response to Sanders\u2019 smack-down, Warren delivered another brutal blow to Biden. Warren\u2019s reply focused on the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, with which she was intricately involved and for which she receives enormous credit among Democrats: So you started this question with how you got something done. You know, following the financial crash of 2008, I had an idea for a consumer agency that would keep giant banks from cheating people. And all of the Washington insiders and strategic geniuses said, don\u2019t even try, because you will never get it passed. And sure enough, the big banks fought us. The Republicans fought us. Some of the Democrats fought us. But we got that agency passed into law. It has now forced big banks to return more than $12 billion directly to people they cheated. I served in the Obama administration. I know what we can do by executive authority, and I will use it. In Congress, on the first day, I will pass my anti-corruption bill, which will beat back the influence of money and repeal the filibuster. And the third, we want to get something done in America, we have to get out there and fight for the things that touch people\u2019s lives. Buttigieg, who had sparred all night with Warren, seemed to sense what was coming next for Biden and attempted to interrupt to spare the former vice president any more pain from the socialists on either side of him. But Biden didn\u2019t take the life raft from South Bend\u2019s mayor, opting instead to further engage with Warren on the 2008 financial crisis. Biden, after fighting the moderators to respond to Warren, attempted to take credit for whipping U.S. Senate votes for the legislation that created the CFPB. \u201cI agreed with the great job she did, and I went on the floor and got you votes,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI got votes for that bill. I convinced people to vote for it. So let\u2019s get those things straight, too.\u201d Big mistake for Biden, as evidenced by the leftists on Twitter ripping him for \u201cyelling\u201d at Warren, lecturing the former college professor on her subject of expertise and claiming she couldn\u2019t have done it without his work whipping votes for her project.     That set Warren up for the line of the night, when Cooper gave the spotlight back to her to reply to Biden. \u201cI am deeply grateful to President Obama, who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law, and I am deeply grateful to every single person who fought for it and who helped pass it into law,\u201d Warren said.  Warren thanking former President Barack Obama, but not Biden, was brutal to Biden. Obama has not endorsed his former vice president in the 2020 Democrat presidential primary, deliberately not supporting his one-time wingman. That void for Biden and lack of support from the Democrats\u2019 most popular star, the former president\u2014despite Biden\u2019s best efforts to closely associate himself with Obama at every turn\u2014cuts like a dagger into his support. It raises all sorts of questions among Democrats, including most importantly about Biden\u2019s electability, about why they should vote for Biden if Obama won\u2019t even endorse and campaign with him. Making matters worse for Biden is that, the morning after this debate, Obama turned around and endorsed Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s re-election north of the border\u2014but still refuses to back his own former right-hand guy.  \u201cYou did a hell of a job in your job,\u201d Biden interrupted Warren\u2019s answer. \u201cThank you,\u201d Warren coolly replied to laughter from the audience. She continued: But understand this. It was a dream big, fight hard. People told me, go for something little, go for something small, go for something that the big corporations will be able to accept. I said, no, let\u2019s go for an agency that will make structural change in our economy. \u201cAnd President Obama said, I will fight for that, and he sometimes had to fight against people in his own administration,\u201d Warren continued before Biden interrupted her again. \u201cNot me!\u201d Biden protested, as Warren refused to credit him with any involvement in the response to the financial crisis. Warren kept plowing through her answer, ignoring Biden\u2019s protests. \u201cWe have to be willing to make good, big, structural change,\u201d she said. By Wednesday, Biden seems to have realized just how bad Tuesday\u2019s debate was for his campaign, as before he even left Ohio he was out ripping Sanders and Warren to anyone in the press who would listen, accusing them of \u201cplaying Trump\u2019s game and trying to con the American people.\u201d He ripped Sanders and Warren for not being able to explain how they would pay for their mass increases in government benefits and claimed both were disingenuous. Meanwhile, the establishment media keeps playing up Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) as candidates they say had big nights, as Democrats desperately look for someone to be able to effectively counter Warren\u2019s and Sanders\u2019 socialist vision\u2014all while establishment-favorite blasts from the past like former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and the 2016 Democrat nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton are discussed as potential Democrat saviors from the leftist socialist abyss.",

Bernie Sanders as Putin? Biden also unexpectedly gestured at Bernie Sanders when referring to Vladimir Putin. \u201cExcuse me,\u201d Bernie Sanders interupted, \u201cVladimir Putin, here?\u201d 3. Which son? Biden defended his son Hunter Biden serving on the board of a Ukrainian energy company but failed to differentiate him from his deceased son Beau Biden, who was the Attorney General of Delaware. \u201cEven when my son was the attorney general of the state of Delaware, we never discussed anything so that there would be no potential conflict,\u201d he said, without naming Beau. 4. He chokes! Twitter users also flagged a moment when Biden choked on his spit or coughed during a response.  5. Ending Roe vs. Wade? Biden also stumbled when saying he was \u201cput in the position of ending Roe vs. Wade\u201d before correcting himself to talk about gun sales. 6. Biden vague on the issue of being vague Biden criticized his Democrat rival Elizabeth Warren for being vague, but ended up sounding more vague in the process. \u201cPart of that requires you not being vague,\u201d Biden said. When asked to explain what he meant, he meandered on for several seconds talking about the different costs of healthcare. 7. Age is wisdom When asked about his age, Biden said that his advanced age gave him \u201cwisdom\u201d to be president. \u201cOne of the reasons I\u2019m running is because of my age and my experience,\u201d he said. \u201cWith it comes wisdom. We need someone to take office this time around who on day one can stand on the world stage, command the respect of world leaders.\u201d Biden struggled throughout the night to demonstrate that his advanced age made him more qualified to be president than any of the younger candidates.",

Priced at $30.00, the t-shirt is available for\u00a0pre-order to begin shipping on October 29th.  Biden first used the phrase in late September when he snapped at a reporter who asked about President Donald Trump suggesting Ukraine look into allegations of corruption against him and his son, Hunter Biden. \u201cI know Trump deserves to be investigated. He\u2019s violating every basic norm of a president,\u201d Biden told Fox News Channel correspondent Peter Doocy. \u201cYou should be asking him the question, why is he on the phone with a foreign leader trying to intimidate a foreign leader,\u201d the former vice president continued. \u201cTrump is doing this because he knows I will beat him like a drum. He\u2019s using abuse of power and every element of the presidency to try to do something to smear me.\u201d \u201cAsk the right questions,\u201d he then demanded of Doocy. During Tuesday evening\u2019s Democrat presidential debate, Biden once again made the pledge to beat President Trump \u201clike a drum\u201d while defending Hunter against accusations of\u00a0nepotism and corruption related to his son\u2019s work in Ukraine and China. \u201cMy son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong. I carried out the policy of the United States government in rooting out corruption in Ukraine,\u201d Biden said.\u00a0\u201cThe president and his thugs are lying. He doesn\u2019t want me to be the candidate. If I\u2019m the candidate, he knows I will beat him like a drum.\u201d While the t-shirt demonstrates the Biden campaign is confident it will win the Democrat party, it still has to fend off the insurgent campaign of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), who is leading the former vice president in several statewide polls. Although the Biden has latched onto the phrase, it appears Sen.\u00a0Lindsey Graham (R-SC) used it in 2016 when (erroneously) predicting what then-Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton would do to then-candidate Trump in the general election. \u201cI\u2019d hold my nose and vote for him but we\u2019d get killed. Hillary Clinton would beat him like a drum,\u201d he told CNN.",
