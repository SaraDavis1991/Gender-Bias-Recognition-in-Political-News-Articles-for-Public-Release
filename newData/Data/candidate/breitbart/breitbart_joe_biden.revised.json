      "author": "AWR Hawkins",
      "content": " O\u2019Rourke\u2019s gun control efforts were characterized by a pledge to confiscate AR-15 and AK-47 rifles. He clearly stated it on September 12, 2019, saying, \u201cHell yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15,\u201d then stood behind the pledge by telling MSNBC the confiscatory policy would be \u201cmandatory\u201d not voluntary. Days later, CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo asked O\u2019Rourke if he was really intent on confiscating certain firearms. O\u2019Rourke answered, \u201cYes\u201d and emphasized his confiscatory goals were centered on AR-15 and AK-47 rifles and their variants. On October 16, 2019, Breitbart News reported O\u2019Rourke\u2019s admission law enforcement would be sent to the visit those who refused to comply with the AR-15 ban. He told MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe: I think just as, in any law that is not followed, or flagrantly abused, there have to be consequences, or else there is no respect for the law. In that case, I think there would be a visit by law enforcement to recover that firearm and to make sure that it is purchased, bought back, so that it cannot be, potentially used against someone else. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s confiscation plans did not translate into support in the polls and he dropped out of the race on Friday, November 1. Biden reacted to O\u2019Rourke\u2019s decision to pull out by tweeting\u00a0about O\u2019Rourke\u2019s \u201cleadership\u201d and specifically declaring that \u201chis passion for solving our gun crisis has been inspiring to anyone who has seen him.\u201d AWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News.

      "subtitle": "A round of swing state polling from the far-left New York Times explains why the establishment media are so desperate to see President Trump impeached.",
      "author": "John Nolte",
      "content": " Among likely voters, Trump is losing by only two points to Quid Pro Joe Biden in Florida, Arizona, and Wisconsin. In Pennsylvania and Michigan, Slow Joe is only up by a single point. Trump leads in North Carolina by two. Bernie Sanders only beats Trump in one of those states: Michigan, by three points. They are tied in Wisconsin. Trump beats Bernie by four points in both Arizona and North Carolina, by one in Pennsylvania, and two in Florida. As far as the current Democrat presidential frontrunner Elizabeth Warren, Trump leads from two to four points in all of those states, except Arizona, where they\u2019re tied. If that\u2019s not scary enough for the media, the latest polling has Trump winning Nevada, a state he lost in 2016, In other words, if Bernie or the Fake Indian (who is currently the favorite) win the nomination, at least according to these polls, Trump wins the electoral college and a second term. As far as Biden, the Great Slight Hope, who is considered Trump\u2019s most formidable opponent\u2026 Well, here\u2019s why the fake media are terrified and pushing for Trump\u2019s impeachment and removal: like the rest of us, the media know these four things for certain\u2026 The media are especially freaked because they know history is on Trump\u2019s side\u2026 Time and time and time again, when a sitting president runs for office, his polling numbers jump. This is just a fact. When a president gets himself out of the White House, out behind the Resolute Desk to make his case, to appeal directly to voters in the real world, his standing always improves. There are no exceptions in the modern presidency. Richard Nixon jumped from the mid-50s to over 60 percent while running for re-election in late 1972. In late 1979, Jimmy Carter\u2019s approval rating jumped about ten points in the months before he lost to Ronald Reagan. Reagan jumped about ten points in the months before he was sworn in for a second time in early 1985. George H.W. Bush zoomed from 30 percent to close to 50 percent in a matter of a few months before losing to Bill Clinton. Clinton gained at least ten points in the months before his \u201996 re-election. Due to the highs he hit after September 11, \u00a0George W. Bush is something an outlier, but the downward spiral that defined his two-term presidency, bumps up nearly 10 points in late 2004. Barack Obama spiked nearly ten points in the months leading up to his 2012 re-election. Anyone who\u2019s followed presidential politics knows that campaigns matter, that the incumbent will almost certainly benefit from campaigning, and if Trump is within striking distance of a second term while stuck in the White House and embroiled in the current media and political environment, our corrupt media know their best, and maybe only hope, is to rig the impeachment process. The media have no other choice\u2026 All their old tricks are not working. The Russia Collusion Hoax collapsed. Practically begging for a recession failed. Releasing the same scary-looking national polls that failed in 2016 only make us laugh. Freaking out over every little thing Trump does has only backfired to a point where no one outside of DC sees impeachment as anything unique or special. The media have failed entirely at separating Trump from his base. And no amount of shrieking about protecting norms and screaming Nazi! can change the fact that Trump is doing a good job. Here\u2019s the other thing\u2026 Nothing that\u2019s happening today matters. Not impeachment. Not Ukraine. Nothing. It\u2019s all kabuki. If Trump holds on to his base (and he will) and the GDP numbers for the first three quarters of 2019 are solid, chances are much better than not that he wins another four years, and will deserve to win another four years\u2026 Unless\u2026 The corporate media can gaslight 20 Republican senators into overturning a national election over a banal phone call made by a sitting president looking into Joe Biden\u2019s legitimate corruption.

      "subtitle": "Top Democrat candidates are trailing President Trump in a general election matchup in Texas, a\u00a0University of Texas/Texas Tribune Poll shows.",
      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " The survey, taken October 18-27, among 1,200 registered voters, found that none of the Democrats in the presidential race,\u00a0not even top candidates Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Joe Biden (D), or Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), would be able to defeat Trump in the Lone Star state. Respondents were asked, \u201cWho would you vote for in this possible general election matchup?\u201d The survey showed both Warren and Biden trailing Trump by seven points, 39 percent to Trump\u2019s 46 percent. Sanders, while still losing, suffers a defeat by a smaller margin, 40 percent to Trump\u2019s 45 percent. Even Texas native Beto O\u2019Rourke (D), who dropped out of the presidential race last week, lost to the president, with 41 percent to Trump\u2019s 47 percent. The survey also shows former San Antonio Mayor Juli\u00e1n Castro (D) falling to Trump in a head to head matchup by double digits, or 13 percentage points. The margin of error is +/- 2.83 percent. The results were as follows: Trump: 46 percent\n\nWarren: 39 percent Trump: 46 percent\n\nBiden: 39 percent Trump: 45 percent\n\nSanders: 40 percent Trump: 46 percent\n\nCastro: 33 percent Trump: 47 percent\n\nO\u2019Rourke: 41 percent However, the Texas Tribune notes that \u201csignificant numbers of Democrats are holding back their votes \u2014 possibly a sign that while they oppose the Republican incumbent, they favor a different Democrat\u201d: For instance, 89% of Republicans say they would support Trump over Biden, and 5% say they would favor Biden, leaving 6% unwilling to pick. But in the same race, 82% of Democrats favor Biden, and 4% favor Trump, leaving 14% who either like another Democrat more or don\u2019t want to pick yet. The biggest gap was in the Trump-Castro matchup, where 93% of Republicans have a definite choice and only 71% of Democrats do. Joshua Blank, research director of the Texas Politics Project at UT-Austin, does not necessarily believe the results will reflect what will happen in the general election, but he noted that the results become \u201cmore Republican\u201d as they \u201cmove from registered voters to likely voters in Texas.\u201d A blue shift scare has been on the mind of the GOP as Democrats continue in their attempts to flip Texas blue. Last year\u2019s Texas senate race, between\u00a0Sen. Ted Cruz (D-TX) and O\u2019Rourke, sparked concerns, as Cruz narrowly defeated his Democrat challenger\u00a050.9 percent to 48.3 percent. However, as Breitbart News pointed out, O\u2019Rourke lost despite \u201ctremendous support from Hollywood and\u00a0double\u00a0the campaign contributions\u2013 $70.2 million to Cruz\u2019s $33.4 million.\u201d Nonetheless, the results were still too close for comfort for the GOP, which has been beefing up resources in Texas ever since. \u201cWithout our 38 electoral votes, no Republican candidate has a path to victory for the foreseeable future. That is why we are asking for the support of people around the country,\u201d\u00a0Republican Party of Texas chairman James Dickey said\u00a0on Sirius XM\u2019s\u00a0Breitbart News Saturday in April. \u201cOne of the things that we face as a challenge in Texas is people assume that Texas always has been and always will be red. That\u2019s not true. It was only 16 years ago that Republicans even took the Texas House,\u201d Dickey continued. \u201cDemocrats have been pouring money and pouring resources into Texas to try and flip Texas,\u201d he added. Trump won Texas in 2016 with 52.2 percent to Hillary Clinton\u2019s 43.2 percent.",

      "content": " His comments came soon after the Democrats released the transcripts of the testimony provided by former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch on October 11 and Michael McKinley, a former senior advisor to the Secretary of State with no direct knowledge to Ukrain, on October 16. Jordan, the top Republican on the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, one of three panels conducting the impeachment probe, called on Democrats to release the full transcript of the deposition provided by former U.S. Special Envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker, the first witness of the inquiry. Echoing Jordan and other Republicans, Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), argued in early October that the full transcript of Volker\u2019s testimony would have already \u201cexonerated\u201d President Donald Trump of any wrongdoing. In the wake of the release of the first set of impeachment probe testimony transcripts, Jordan wrote on Twitter Monday, \u201cDemocrats cherry pick which transcripts they release and when. Why not release Ambassador Volker\u2019s testimony? He was the very first witness to testify!\u201d  The House Committees on Oversight and Reform, Intelligence, and Foreign Affairs are conduction the impeachment investigation. It appears Democrats are choosing first to release the transcripts of individuals who provided negative\u00a0information\u00a0about President Donald Trump. Meanwhile, they are holding on to the testimony of individuals who contradicted the quid pro quo claim at the center of the probe in which Trump allegedly pressured Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, in exchange for aid. Trump and Ukraine have denied the claim. A \u201cwhistleblower\u201d complaint accusing Trump of leveraging aid to pressure Ukraine to launch a probe into corruption allegations against the Bidens triggered the impeachment inquiry. Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-NY), a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee who has also witnessed the impeachment probe testimonies, noted via Twitter Monday that \u201cthere is nothing\u201d in the testimony provided by Yovanovitch and McKinley \u201cto impeach [Trump] for.\u201d  Since the probe began, Republicans have repeatedly called on Democrats to release all the transcripts of testimony provided so far \u2014 all behind closed doors. Republican lawmakers have blasted Democrats for cherrypicking and mischaracterizing evidence obtained during the private depositions. The partisan impeachment probe resolution, approved along partisan lines last week with two Democrats joining all Republicans in opposing it, authorizes the release of transcripts \u201cwith appropriate\u201d unilateral \u201credactions for classified and other sensitive information.\u201d However, the resolution does not compel the release of all transcripts, leaving it up to House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) to decide which ones to release and when.",

      "content": " John Eisenberg, the National Security Council\u2019s lawyer; his deputy, Michael Ellis; Robert Blair, a senior adviser to Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney; and Brian McCormack, the associate director for natural resources at the Office of Management and Budget, are all refusing to participate in their scheduled deposition Monday. House Democrats pursuing the partisan impeachment inquiry reportedly subpoenaed all four to testify in private. In a letter sent to White House Counsel Pat Cipollone on Sunday, the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s (DOJ) Office of Legal Counsel concluded that high-level presidential advisers like Eisenberg have \u201cabsolute immunity\u201d from congressional subpoenas for testimony, CBS News reported. Assistant Attorney General Steven Engel argued that\u00a0White House attorney Eisenberg is under no obligation to comply with the subpoena issued by House Democrats conducting the impeachment probe. \u201cYou have asked whether the Committee may compel Mr. Eisenberg to testify,\u201d Engel wrote in the November 3 letter.\u201d We conclude that he is absolutely immune from compelled congressional testimony in his capacity as a senior adviser to the President.\u201d Cipollone then informed William Burck, Eisenberg\u2019s lawyer, that President Donald Trump \u201cdirects\u201d the White House attorney \u201cnot to appear at the Committees deposition\u201d Monday. CNN noted: As more witnesses in the impeachment probe continue to refuse to give testimony, House investigators are signaling they are prepared to begin the next phase of their inquiry \u2014 even if their subpoenas are ignored across the board. A number of House Democrats told CNN that it\u2019s time for that next step, saying they\u2019ve already built enough evidence to advance the proceedings to the public stage. House Democrats pursuing the impeachment inquiry are supposed to be trying to determine if Trump abused his power by allegedly pressuring Ukraine to investigate corruption allegations against White House hopeful Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, in exchange for aid. There are signs, however, that the partisan probe may go far beyond Ukraine. Trump and Ukraine have denied the allegation at the center of the impeachment probe\u00a0\u2014 that the president leveraged aid to pressure the Eastern European country to investigate the Bidens.",

Predictably, more Democrats (69 percent) believe Trump\u2019s actions were illegal than Republicans (eight percent). Among Independents, however, nearly two-thirds (63 percent) believe Trump\u2019s actions amounted to something \u201cunethical but not illegal\u201d (43 percent) or \u201cnothing wrong\u201d (20 percent). Only 27 percent of Independents believe Trump\u2019s actions were illegal. The number (80 percent) of those who think Trump has neither done something illegal (66 percent) nor wrong (14 percent) is also high among the 13 percent who neither approve nor disapprove of the impeachment probe. Only 18 percent of those who are neutral on the impeachment inquiry believe Trump has done something illegal. House Democrat impeachment investigators are supposed to be trying to determine whether Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate corruption allegations against Joe Biden and his son Hunter in exchange for aid during a July 25 phone call. There are signs, however, that the Democrats are engaged in a fishing expedition that will likely expand the probe far beyond Ukraine. The recent poll finds that a vast majority (69 percent) of adults believe \u201cit was inappropriate for\u201d Hunter \u201cto have a role on the board of a Ukrainian energy company while his father was vice president. Only 27% think it was appropriate. Trump has urged his Ukrainian counterpart to launch a probe into corruption allegations against the energy company Burisma Holdings that employed Hunter Biden. While giving his deposition in the impeachment probe, top State Department official George Kent told House investigators that the Obama administration \u201crebuffed\u201d his warnings that Burisma was corrupt. That means the Obama administration cleared Hunter Biden to work at Burisma even though it knew the company was corrupt. The AP-NORC pollsters note: The nationwide poll was conducted October 24-28, 2019, using the AmeriSpeak\u00ae Panel, the probability-based panel of NORC at the University of Chicago. Online and telephone interviews using landlines and cell phones were conducted with 1,075 adults. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 4.1 percentage points. According to the poll, 47 percent of adults approve of the impeachment inquiry, compared to 38 percent who do not and 13 percent who neither approve nor disapprove. That means slightly more than half (51 percent) are either neutral or disapprove of the probe. Unsurprisingly, more Democrats (83 percent) support the probe than Republicans (11 percent). Meanwhile, more than half (58 percent) of Independents are either neutral (28 percent) or disapprove (30 percent) of the inquiry.",

The allegations stem from Zlochevsky\u2019s tenure as Ukraine\u2019s minister of ecology and natural resources in the early 2010s, where it is purported he used his position to approve oil and gas licenses for Burisma. In order to get the meeting with the State Dept., Burisma\u2019s representatives specifically invoked the former vice president\u2019s youngest son, Hunter, who sat on the company\u2019s board of directors. The documents, which were obtained through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit by John Solomon, do not indicate if the meeting ever took place. Solomon has indicated that there are more records forthcoming, subject to an ongoing FOIA lawsuit. Although the records can not confirm if an actual meeting took place, the timeline of events that transpired shortly afterwards were directly to Burisma\u2019s benefit. In March 2016, Biden issued an ultimatum to then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko: either the government fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, or the U.S. would rescind upwards of $1 billion in aid. According to Biden\u2019s official recollection of the incident, he issued the ultimatum on behalf of then-President Barack Obama, who had lost faith in Shokin\u2019s ability to root out corruption. Unofficially, though, it was well known that that Shokin was ramping up his investigation into both Burisma and Zlochvesky. Shokin\u2019s probe had progressed far enough that he was able to convince the Ukrainian courts in early 2016 to seize Zlochvesky\u2019s remaining assets in the country. The oligarch only evaded arrest because he was already hiding abroad after having fled Ukraine in 2014 when a pro-western uprising toppled his allies in the country\u2019s then-pro-Russian government. Adding to the appearance of conflicting interests behind the former vice president\u2019s decision to oust Shokin is that the prosecutor has claimed he was preparing to interview Hunter Biden about his Burisma tenure when he was fired. The revelations come into the spotlight as questions mount as to how Hunter Biden was able to secure an appointment to Burisma\u2019s board in the first place. As Peter Schweizer, senior contributor at Breitbart News,\u00a0detailed\u00a0in his book\u00a0Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends, Hunter Biden secured the position, which\u00a0paid\u00a0as much as\u00a0$83,000 per month, despite no having background in energy or Ukraine. Adding to the appearance of impropriety is the fact that\u00a0Hunter Biden joined Burisma at a time the company was seen as actively courting western leaders to prevent further scrutiny of its business practices. The same month the younger\u2019s Biden appointment was announced,\u00a0the government of Great Britain\u00a0froze\u00a0accounts belonging to Burisma founder Mykola Zlochevsky under suspicion of money laundering. Zlochevsky, a former Ukrainian minister of natural resources, would later be accused of\u00a0corruption\u00a0for using his office to approve oil and gas licenses to Burisma. A Ukrainian official with strong ties to Zlochevsky admitted in October the only reason that Hunter Biden secured the appointment was to \u201cprotect\u201d the company from foreign scrutiny. The claim has credence given that at the time Joe Biden, as the sitting vice president, was tasked with leading the Obama administration\u2019s policy towards Ukraine in response to Russia\u2019s invasion of Crimea. Hunter Biden, himself, admitted his father\u2019s political influence was the likely reason for his appointment to Burisma\u2019s board during a recent ABC News interview. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. Probably not, in retrospect,\u201d the younger Biden said when asked if he would have been tapped for the lucrative job had his father not been the sitting vice president. He quickly added, though, that\u00a0his family\u2019s political prominence had always played a large role in his dealings. \u201cBut that\u2019s\u2014you know\u2014I don\u2019t think that there\u2019s a lot of things that would have happened in my life if my last name wasn\u2019t Biden.\u201d",

      "author": "Haris Alic",
      "content": " A new\u00a0survey conducted by Harvard University and the Harris Poll found that 58 percent of registered voters nationally think the younger Biden exercised \u201cbad judgment\u201d by taking a seat on the board of directors of Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian oil and gas conglomerate, while his father was tasked with overseeing Obama administration policy in the region. Furthermore, 27 percent of voters believed Hunter Biden\u2019s decision to accept the position, which at times paid as much as $83,000 a month, may have broken U.S. laws regarding public corruption or conflicts of interest. Only 14 percent of those polled claimed the shadowy business dealing were \u201cnot an issue of concern.\u201d The results, which mirror a recent poll by the Associated Press showing that 69 percent of voters believe the Ukraine venture was \u201cinappropriate,\u201d do not bode well for either Hunter Biden or the former vice president, who has struggled on the campaign trail to explain his son\u2019s foreign dealings. In particular, both have failed to properly address how and why Hunter Biden secured an appointment to Burisma\u2019s board in the first place. As Peter Schweizer, senior contributor at Breitbart News, detailed in his\u00a0book,\u00a0Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends, Hunter Biden had no prior experience with either the energy industry or Ukraine before joining Burisma in April 2014. Adding to the appearance of impropriety is the fact that\u00a0Hunter Biden joined Burisma at a time the company was seen as actively courting western leaders to prevent further scrutiny of its business practices. The same month the younger Biden\u2019s appointment was announced,\u00a0the government of Great Britain\u00a0froze\u00a0accounts belonging to Burisma founder Mykola Zlochevsky under suspicion of money laundering. Zlochevsky, a former Ukrainian minister of natural resources, would later be accused of\u00a0corruption\u00a0for using his office to approve oil and gas licenses to Burisma. A Ukrainian official with strong ties to Zlochevsky admitted in October the only reason that Hunter Biden secured the appointment was to \u201cprotect\u201d the company from foreign scrutiny. The claim has credence given that at the time Joe Biden, as the sitting vice president, led Obama administration policy towards Ukraine in response to Russia\u2019s invasion of Crimea. The former vice president\u2019s influence was so immense that in 2016 he was able to force the Ukrainian government to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin. Officially, the former vice president has asserted his threat to withhold U.S. aid to Ukraine if Shokin was not fired came from the Obama administration, which had lost confidence in the prosecutor\u2019s abilities to\u00a0root out corruption. Unofficially, though, it was well known that Shokin was investigating both Burisma and Zlochevsky for wrongdoing. Regardless of the reason, Shokin\u2019s successor closed the probe into Burisma, allowing Zlochevsky to return to the country after having\u00a0fled\u00a0it in 2014. The Harvard/Harris poll found similar results when respondents were asked about a $1.5 billion deal Hunter Biden inked with a subsidiary of the state-owned Bank of China in 2013. The lucrative deal, which created the private equity firm Bohai Harvest RST (BHR), has come under scrutiny because it came only 12 days after the younger Biden visited China with his father aboard Air Force Two. Officially, the then-vice president was visiting the country amid escalating tensions over islands in the South China Sea and decided to bring his granddaughter and son along. During an\u00a0interview\u00a0with\u00a0Breitbart News Tonight\u00a0in March 2018, however, Schweizer detailed the political machinations that preceded Hunter Biden\u2019s venture with China: In December of 2013, Vice President Joe Biden flies to Asia for a trip, and the centerpiece for that trip is a visit to Beijing, China. To put this into context, in 2013, the Chinese have just exerted air rights over the South Pacific, the South China Sea. They basically have said, \u2018If you want to fly in this area, you have to get Chinese approval. We are claiming sovereignty over this territory.\u2019 Highly controversial in Japan, in the Philippines, and in other countries. Joe Biden is supposed to be going there to confront the Chinese. Well, he gets widely criticized on that trip for going soft on China. For basically not challenging them, and Japan and other countries are quite upset about this. Since its creation, BHR has invested heavily in energy and defense projects across the globe. Although Hunter Biden announced last month he was resigning from the company\u2019s board,\u00a0he is expected to keep his ten percent stake in BHR, which is\u00a0estimated\u00a0to be worth millions. When voters were asked about this particular venture, 51 percent said it constituted \u201cbad judgment\u201d but was likely not illegal. Another 33 percent believed it may have been illega, and only 16 percent claimed it was \u201cnot an issue of concern. Given\u00a0that a majority of respondents asserted the younger Biden exercised \u201cbad judgment,\u201d it was not surprising that 51 percent also believed he should return all funds received through his dealings in China and Ukraine. Meanwhile, 49 percent stated such an act was not necessary if Hunter Biden pledged to not seek out any such ventures if his father was to become president. The Harvard/Harris poll surveyed 1,810 registered voters from across the country between October 29 through October 31.",

Trump also reminded his supporters that Hunter Biden secured a $1.5 billion investment for his firm from the state-owned Bank of China in 2014, just days after visiting the country with his father while Biden was Vice President. \u201cHe\u2019ll make millions and millions on that,\u201d Trump said, referring to the investment, and added, \u201cThe Bidens got rich while America got robbed.\u201d The president again said that Chinese leaders would love to see Biden become the next president, so they could make an easier deal with the United States. \u201cThis is what China would love more than anything else,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen, folks, because we can\u2019t let our country go back to hell.

      "author": "Edwin Mora",
      "content": " It appears that Schiff wanted McKinley to say that politics drove Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, at the behest of President Donald Trump, to remove former Ukraine Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch from her post. Schiff insinuated that Pompeo had removed Yovanovitch to hide wrongdoing in Ukraine at the hands of the Trump administration. The California Democrat attempted to get McKinley to confirm his innuendo. Such a confirmation would have fueled the Democrats\u2019 impeachment agenda. Throughout his testimony, McKinley made it clear that he had no direct knowledge of the Ukraine matter that triggered the impeachment probe. He also stressed that he never discussed political issues with Pompeo. Republicans have accused Schiff, the leader of the impeachment inquiry, of \u201ccoaching\u201d witnesses while taking depositions. House impeachment investigators are trying to determine if Trump abused his power by allegedly pressuring his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky, to investigate corruption allegations against Joe Biden and his son Hunter in exchange for aid during a July 25 call. Trump and Zelensky have denied the accusation. McKinley accused Schiff of mischaracterizing his comments about a conversation he had with Pompeo over his concerns about the lack of support for Yovanovitch after he learned that Trump told Zelensky she was \u201cbad news\u201d during the call. The top State Department official, who served as a senior adviser to Pompeo until he resigned on October 11, did not learn about the contents of the call until the White House released the transcript on September 24. McKinley accused Schiff of trying to put words in his mouth while testifying on October 16. Although McKinley had already explained that he did not receive a direct response from Pompeo when he suggested that the State Department should release a statement in support of Yovanovitch, Schiff continued to pressure him to say what he wanted to hear. The exchange between McKinley and Schiff is described in the transcript as follows: Schiff: Can you go back and, as best you can, tell us exactly what you told the Secretary? McKinley: I said, are you aware of I\u2019m sure you\u2019re following what is happening. Wouldn\u2019t it be good if we put out a statement on Ambassador Yovanovitch? Schiff: When you said, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware of what\u2019s happening. McKinley: That\u2019s right. Of course he said, yeah. You know, it\u2019s that kind of exchange. I mean, to formalize it as something more. Schiff: No, no. I\u2019m just I\u2019m not trying to formalize it. I\u2019m just trying to get exactly what was said during the meeting. McKinley sought a statement from the State Department in support of Yovanovitch after she was removed her from her post in Ukraine. During her deposition, Yovanovitch explained that Trump pressured the State Department to remove her because he had \u201clost confidence\u201d in her, adding that she was told by a superior that she \u201chad done nothing wrong.\u201d The president has the right to remove any of his ambassadors, McKinley acknowledged. On October 11, McKinley resigned from his post at the State Department over the lack of support for Yovanovitch and concerns about the \u201cwhistleblower\u2019s\u201d claim that Trump had politicized aid to Ukraine. The \u201cwhistleblower\u2019s\u201d allegations are at the heart of the impeachment inquiry. McKinley wanted the State Department to put out a statement saying \u201cclearly that we respect the professionalism, the tenure of Ambassador Yovanovitch in the Ukraine.\u201d He ultimately dropped his quest for the statement after he learned from Morgan Ortagus, a State Department spokesperson, that Pompeo had decided \u201cit was better not to release a statement at this time.\u201d McKinley testified that Ortagus explained that Pompeo did not want to release a statement \u201cin part to protect Ambassador Yovanovitch [by] not draw[ing] undue attention to her.\u201d McKinley, however, testified that he subsequently talked to Yovanovitch, and she said she would welcome the statement.",

Volker testified that he believed that Ukraine did not become aware of the hold on U.S. aid until Politico published a story on the matter, based on leaked information, on August 28, more than a month after the July 25 call. House Democrat impeachment investigators are trying to determine if Trump abused his power by allegedly pressuring Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, and claims of tampering in the 2016 elections during the July 25 call. Trump, Zelensky, Volker, and other impeachment probe witnesses have denied those claims. House investigators asked Volker, \u201cDid President Trump ever withhold a meeting with President Zelensky or delay a meeting with President Zelensky until the Ukrainians committed to investigate the allegations that you just described concerning the [2016] presidential election?\u201d \u201cThe answer to the question is no \u2026. there was no linkage like that,\u201d Volker said.  Rep.

Volker\u2019s denial irked Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), the leader of the impeachment probe, who repeatedly pressured the former envoy to confirm his characterization of events suggesting a quid pro quo took place. Schiff declared: Ambassador, I find it remarkable as a career diplomat that you have difficulty acknowledging that when Ukraine learned that their aid had been suspended for unknown reasons, that this wouldn\u2019t\u00a0 add additional urgency to [an investigation] request by the President of the United States. I find that remarkable. Following weeks of Republican pressure, House Democrats pursuing the impeachment inquiry released the transcript of the Volker\u2019s October 3 deposition. Republicans have argued that Volker\u2019s testimony exonerates Trump of the allegations that triggered the impeachment probe.",

      "subtitle": "Former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s most conservative supporters say by a majority that they want fewer legal immigrants admitted to the United States every year to reduce foreign competition in the workforce.",
      "author": "John Binder",
      "content": " A comprehensive survey by the New York Times and Siena College reveals how Biden\u2019s most conservative supporters want less legal immigration to the U.S. \u2014 a potential inroad for President Trump and his \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda. The survey finds that 41 percent of Biden voters who do not support Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) say women running for president \u201cjust aren\u2019t that likable.\u201d These Biden voters, the survey finds, are mostly men and working class who align with Trump on a series of cultural and political issues. For example, of these Biden voters, a majority of 54 percent said they want to reduce legal immigration levels wherein currently the U.S. admits about 1.2 million mostly low-skilled legal immigrants every year who compete for jobs against working and middle class Americans.  About 55 percent of these conservative Biden voters said discrimination against white Americans is now as big of a problem as discrimination against minorities, and 79 percent said political correctness has \u201cgone too far.\u201d For years, Trump has pushed to decrease legal immigration levels to boost wages for American workers, open job markets for American graduates, and raise the quality of life for the working class. In his 2015 promise, Trump demanded a halt to all immigration in order to allow businesses to hire from the existing labor pool. Since then, Trump has endorsed the RAISE Act to cut legal immigration down to 500,000 admissions a year to raise wages and employment. While the big business lobby, corporate interests, and 2020 Democrats advocate for more legal immigration to the U.S. to increase foreign competition against Americans, about 11.5 million Americans remain either unemployed, underemployed, or out of the labor market \u2013 all of whom want full-time jobs. At the expense of working and middle class Americans, the nation\u2019s legal immigration system has driven the foreign-born workforce to the highest level in decades. Today, 17.5 percent of workers \u2014 or 3-in-17 \u2014 in the U.S. are immigrants. In 2018, foreign-born workers were cheaper to hire for employers, earning a median weekly salary of less than $760. At the same time, native- born American workers\u2019 median weekly salary was $910. The data, though, found that while native-born Americans\u2019 wages have been largely stagnant, foreign-born workers have seen their wages rise. Extensive research by economists like George Borjas and analyst Steven Camarota reveals that the country\u2019s current mass legal immigration system burdens U.S. taxpayers and America\u2019s working and middle class while redistributing about\u00a0$500 billion\u00a0in wealth every year to major employers and newly arrived immigrants. Similarly, research has revealed how Americans\u2019 wages\u00a0are crushed\u00a0by the country\u2019s high immigration levels. For every one-percent increase in the immigrant portion of American workers\u2019 occupations, their weekly wages are cut by about 0.5 percent, Camarota finds. This means the average native-born American worker today has his weekly wages reduced by perhaps 8.75 percent. John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

      "subtitle": "Former U.S. Special Envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker, during his impeachment inquiry deposition last month, highlighted some inaccuracies in the \u201cwhistleblower\u2019s\u201d complaint that sparked the probe, according to transcripts released Tuesday.",
      "author": "Edwin Mora",
      "content": " The complaint mentions Volker five times. Asked for his reaction to those references, Volker told House impeachment investigators, \u201cI thought that it was a fairly accurate characterization. He got some facts wrong.\u201d Under a subsection titled, \u201cOngoing Concerns,\u201d the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d claimed: On 26 July, a day after the call, U.S. Special Representative for Ukraine Negotiations Kurt Volker visited [the Ukraine capital] Kyiv and met with President [Volodymyr] Zelenskyy and a variety of Ukrainian political figures. Ambassador Volker was accompanied in his meetings by U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland. Based on multiple readouts of these meetings recounted to me by various U.S. officials, Ambassadors Volker and Sondland reportedly provided advice to the Ukrainian leadership about how to \u201cnavigate\u201d the demands that the President had made of Mr. Zelenskyy. Volker explained that his visit to Ukraine was unrelated to the call, noting that he did not even know when and if the July 25 call would take place. He also said that he had planned the meeting irrespective of the Trump-Zelensky conversation on July 25, noting: The whistleblower report says that I was dispatched to Ukraine after the president\u2019s phone call to meet with President Zelensky to talk about it. That\u2019s not accurate. I was planning a visit to Ukraine to fall after the 21st of July, which is when the parliamentary election was. I did not want to show up in Ukraine during an election campaign. Volker also suggested that the officials who provided information to the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d did not have their facts straight. \u201cHelping the Ukrainians\u2019 navigate,\u2019 was the word that he used, \u2018requests,\u2019 I believe he said from the President, if I\u2019m not mistaken. There are some mistakes in this,\u201d the former U.S. State Department official added. House investigators have been taking depositions to find out whether Trump abused his power by allegedly levering aid to Ukraine to pressure Zelensky into investigating Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. At the heart of the impeachment inquiry is the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d complaint that accuses Trump of pressuring Zelensky to launch a probe into the Bidens during the July 25 call. Trump, Zelensky, Volker, and other impeachment probe witnesses have denied the \u201cwhistleblower\u2019s\u201d characterization that a quid pro quo offer took place during the conversation. There are signs that House Democrats pursuing the impeachment inquiry are engaged in a fishing expedition that will expand the probe far beyond Ukraine. The \u201cwhistleblower\u201d does not have first-hand knowledge of the call. Some news reports have linked the leaker to Democrats, including Joe Biden. Supporters of the \u201cwhistleblower,\u201d including his lawyers, have not explicitly denied the most recent allegations, made last week.",

      "author": "Edwin Mora",
      "content": " In a new U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) memo that came to light on Tuesday, the Trump administration argued that Democrat impeachment investigators\u2019 attempt to compel testimony from executive branch officials are \u201clegally invalid\u201d unless they allow government attorneys to accompany the witnesses. \u201cThe assistance of agency counsel\u201d is needed because testimony has the potential to disclose information \u201cprotected by executive privilege,\u201d the DOJ Office of Legal Counsel noted in a memo dated November 1. Wells Griffith, a special assistant to Trump and energy adviser on the National Security Council (NSC), and Michael Duffey, associate director for national security programs at the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), did not appear for their Tuesday depositions. Their refusal to testify came a day after four White House officials defied subpoenas for testimony issued by House Democrat impeachment investigators. The White House has told House Democrat leaders it will not cooperate in the impeachment probe. Roll Call suggested that both Griffith and Duffey defied a subpoena to appear. According to the Washington Post, House Democrats are seeking testimony from Duffey because he \u201cwas allegedly involved in approving orders to hold back nearly $400 million in congressionally approved military aid for Ukraine.\u201d Democrats also want a deposition from Griffith because he allegedly \u201ctook part at a key meeting at the White House with Ukrainian officials in July,\u201d the Post\u00a0added. \u201cWe may infer by the White House obstruction here, that their testimony would be further incriminating of the President,\u201d House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) said Monday, referring to the four White House officials who defied their subpoenas that day. In its five-page memo, the DOJ argues that House Democrat\u2019s subpoenas that ask witnesses to appear without counsel are \u201clegally invalid,\u201d noting: The [House Intelligence Committee] could address this separation of powers problem by allowing agency counsel to assist the employee during the deposition. Should the committee not do so, however, a subpoena purporting to require a witness to appear without such assistance would be invalid and not subject to civil or criminal enforcement. The Democrat-led House Committees on Oversight and Reform, Intelligence, and Foreign Affairs are conducting the impeachment probe.",

      "subtitle": "CLAIM: Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland confirmed, contrary to earlier testimony, that there had been a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d between President Donald Trump and the Ukrainian government: military aid for \u201cdirt.\u201d",
      "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
      "content": " The House Intelligence Committee began releasing transcripts this week of its behind-closed-doors interviews with witnesses in the \u201cimpeachment inquiry.\u201d On Tuesday, it released the transcripts of the appearances of Sondland and former Special Representative for Ukraine Kurt Volker. Volker testified that there had never been a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d \u2014 that he had never heard one discussed, and that Ukrainian officials seemed unaware of any such arrangement at all. But Sondland, who had also testified earlier that there was no \u201cquid pro quo,\u201d had to amend that testimony after he was apparently contradicted by U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor, who testified last month that he\u00a0believed there was a \u201cquid pro quo,\u201d under which the Trump administration was withholding key military aid to Ukraine unless it investigated alleged corruption related to former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden. In a supplemental declaration filed with the committee, Sondland said that \u201cby the beginning of September 2019, and in the absence of any credible explanation for the suspension of aid,\u201d he \u201cpresumed that the [Ukraine] aid suspension had become linked to the proposed anti-corruption statement\u201d and the investigation of the Bidens. That led him to tell the Ukrainian government that \u201cresumption of U.S. aid would likely not occur\u201d until it complied. But there are two big logical leaps in Sondland\u2019s statement. The first is that he only \u201cpresumed\u201d there was a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d \u2014 that is, he did not have direct knowledge of one. The second is that he told the Ukrainians that a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d was \u201clikely\u201d \u2014 that is, he did not know with certainty. In their rush to accuse the Trump administration of wrongdoing, Democrats and the media have overlooked one other key fact: the crucial August 2019\u00a0Politico\u00a0article. The article, \u201cTrump holds up Ukraine military aid meant to confront Russia,\u201d dated August 28, was the first that the Ukrainians ever knew about any withholding of aid \u2014 five weeks after the phone call between Trump and Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky which supposedly prompted the so-called \u201cwhistleblower\u201d to approach Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) and the Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee. Sondland refers specifically to\u00a0September. Therefore what changed his \u2014 and others\u2019 \u2014 impression was not anything the administration (or its representatives) did or said. Rather, it was the media. Since Sondland consumes the same media that everyone else does \u2014 indeed, it is part of a diplomat\u2019s job to know what is being said \u2014 he drew his own conclusions. But when he asked President Trump\u00a0directly, Trump told him there was no \u201cquid pro quo\u201d: he just wanted Zelensky to do \u201cthe right thing.\u201d All of this presumes there is something wrong with a \u201cquid pro quo.\u201d But even that seems untrue. In fact, \u201cquid pro quo\u201d arrangements are normal in diplomacy. A House bill passed recently by Democrats would\u00a0establish a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d that bars Russia from access even to\u00a0private U.S. funds until it can be shown not to have interfered in U.S. elections. Trump, Democrats say, sought his personal or political interest; it also happened to be a national interest. For years, Democrats defended the investigations of President Barack Obama\u2019s administration into then-candidate Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign by arguing that the country had to know if a major candidate was corrupt or compromised by a foreign power. That investigation may have been conducted in an unlawful manner \u2014 and a grand jury is now on the case \u2014 but the logic they used then is even more appropriate to Ukraine and the Bidens. Hunter Biden\u2019s role as a go-between for Burisma \u2014 a Ukrainian gas company suspected of corruption \u2014 and his father\u2019s administration has never been fully investigated. The so-called \u201cwhistleblower\u201d worked for Biden at the time; that conflict of interest, too, has never been explored. If Trump had demanded a \u201cquid pro quo,\u201d he would have been\u00a0doing his job. As it is, there is no evidence of a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d \u2014 certainly not from Gordon Sondland.

RealClearInvestigations was the first media outlet to report that it is likely CIA analyst Eric Ciaramella. Ciaramella joined the National Security Council in 2015 and worked with former Vice President Joe Biden. He stayed on at the NSC until 2017, when he was suspected of leaks to the media. He reportedly returned to his home agency. Paul said during the rally on Monday: We also now know the name of the whistleblower. The whistleblower needs to come forward as a material witness because he worked for Joe Biden at the same time Hunter Biden was getting money from corrupt oligarchs. He told CNN\u2019s Suzanne Malveaux during a brief interview on Tuesday that it is not illegal to identify a whistleblower and that whistleblower laws only prevent the government from identifying a whistleblower. \u201cThe whistleblower statute protects the whistleblower from having his name revealed by the inspector general. Even the New York Times admits that no one else is under any legal obligation,\u201d he said. Paul went on to say: The whistleblower is actually a material witness completely separate from being the whistleblower because he worked for Joe Biden. He worked for Joe Biden at the same time Hunter Biden was receiving $50,000 a month. So the investigation into the corruption of Hunter Biden involves this whistleblower because he was there at the time. Did he bring up the conflict of interest? Was there discussion of this? What was his involvement with the relationship between Joe Biden and the prosecutors? There\u2019s a lot of questions the whistleblower needs to answer.

      "author": "Haris Alic",
      "content": " The former vice president, who was once the Democrat frontrunner but has been eclipsed by Warren in recent months, made the comments in a self-published Medium piece titled, \u201cI Have Fought for the Democratic Party My Whole Career.\u201d The piece, although not mentioning Warren by name, set out to repudiate not only her suggestion that Biden should be seeking the Republican nomination but also the \u201cangry unyielding viewpoint\u201d that those who \u201cdisagree with you \u2026 must be a coward or corrupt or a small thinker.\u201d \u201cSome call it the \u2018my way or the highway\u2019 approach to politics. But it\u2019s worse than that. It\u2019s condescending to the millions of Democrats who have a different view,\u201d the former vice president wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s representative of an elitism that working and middle class people do not share: \u2018We know best; you know nothing\u2019. \u2018If you were only as smart as I am you would agree with me.'\u201d Biden proceeded to argue such tactics were not conducive to getting \u201canything done\u201d or building a party that was capable of beating President Donald Trump in 2020. \u201cI learned a long time ago that if you question someone\u2019s motivations rather than their judgment you get nowhere,\u201d he stated. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to get past go if you start off by saying the other person is in the pocket of special interests or is corrupt.\u201d Despite the pleas for \u201ccompromise\u201d and \u201cunity,\u201d Biden spent a good deal of the piece highlighting his own policy prescriptions, many of which are directly in opposition to those being proposed by more liberal Democrats like Warren. In particular, the former vice president touted his proposal for expanding ObamaCare through a public option, which Warren and others have claimed will not be as efficient as Medicare for All. \u201cI stand with the Democratic Party of Barack Obama \u2014 the party that fought for and passed the Affordable Care Act \u2014 an historic transformation of our health care system that took a generation to achieve,\u201d Biden wrote. \u201cI\u2019m not walking away from ObamaCare \u2026 Maybe others want to walk away from ObamaCare \u2014 I don\u2019t.\u201d The medium piece comes as the Biden and Warren camps have traded barbs back and forth in recent weeks. Biden, specifically, has attacked Warren for lying about how she would pay for her Medicare for All proposal without raising taxes on the middle class. It was in response to such attacks last week that Warren suggested Biden was \u201crunning in the wrong presidential primary.\u201d Even though Biden had technically started the altercation, the former vice president\u2019s campaign manager used the opening to attack\u00a0Warren\u2019s prior Republican affiliation. Many have noted that the flare-up between the two camps underscores the ideological divisions raging within the Democrat Party at the moment. Biden, who claims to be the only Democrat to win back the white working class, is campaigning as something of a moderate that will bring forth incremental change. The strategy is evident by the former vice president\u2019s policy platform, which is full of ideas that were seen as too radical during the Obama years but are now considered tepid when compared to those advocated by progressives like Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY). Warren, on the other hand, is a proponent of radical change, as exhibited by her endorsements of a wealth tax and the Green New Deal. Adding to the antagonism between the camps is the precarious position Biden finds himself in three months away from the first nominating contest in Iowa. Although the former vice president started the race as the clear frontrunner, leading the field by as much as\u00a032 percentage points\u00a0at one point, his campaign has steadily declined. Biden\u2019s decreasing political fortunes have comes as Warren\u2019s have\u00a0only increased. The Massachusetts Democrat has leapfrogged Biden in the early primary and caucus states. One recent poll out of Iowa showed Warren leading the field with 28 percent support among Democrats, while Biden was relegated to fourth place\u00a0with only 12 percent. A similar situation has played out nationally, by which most polls show Warren leading Biden, albeit with a narrow margin. As Biden\u2019s campaign spins downward, his attacks on Warren, who many now acknowledge as the frontrunner, have only increased, culminating in his Medium piece on Tuesday. \u201cI have fought for the Democratic party my whole career. I know what we stand for, who we stand with and what we believe. And it\u2019s not just policies or issues. It\u2019s in my bones,\u201d the former vice president stated. \u201cThat\u2019s not something everyone in this primary can say.\u201d",

      "author": "Aaron Klein",
      "content": " That and other emails show Ciaramella interfaced about Ukraine with individuals who played key roles in facilitating the infamous anti-Trump dossier produced by Fusion GPS and reportedly financed by Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee. One of those individuals, then-Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs Victoria Nuland (pictured), received updates on Ukraine issues from dossier author Christopher Steele in addition to Nuland\u2019s direct role in the dossier controversy. Also part of the email chains was Christopher J. Anderson, who was a special adviser to former special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker. Anderson testified to the Democrat-led House committees running the impeachment inquiry. Ciaramella\u2019s name comes up in six Obama-era government emails that were released by the State Department as part of two previous Freedom of Information Act requests.\u00a0 At the time of the exchanges, Ciaramella served as the Director for Baltic and Eastern European Affairs for the Obama-era National Security Council, where he worked on Ukraine policy.\u00a0 He is now an analyst at the Central Intelligence Agency. One email, titled, \u201cLoan Guarantee,\u201d involved Nuland, who was reportedly a key champion of the Ukraine loan guarantee policy. \u201cHurray,\u201d a celebratory Nuland wrote in response to a translated Ukrainian government announcement about the signing of the $1 billion loan guarantee.\u00a0 The announcement singles out Joe Biden as being present for the conclusion of an agreement leading to the loan guarantee. Ciaramella was one of several people CC\u2019d in the email, which was sent from the U.S. ambassador at the time, Geoffrey Pyatt, who was another key champion of the loan guarantee to Ukraine along with Nuland. The email is one of several that shows Ciaramella in the loop with top officials such as Nuland working on Ukraine policy under the Obama administration. The loan guarantee was pushed through after Ukraine agreed to several reforms, especially the firing of the nation\u2019s top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin. This at a time that Shokin was reportedly investigating Burisma, the Ukranian natural gas company paying Hunter Biden.\u00a0 Joe Biden infamously boasted on video about personally threatening to withhold loan guarantees from Ukraine unless Shokin was removed. Another released email shows Ciaramella himself sending a message to Nuland and others. Most of the contents are blocked out, including the email\u2019s subject line. One non-classified section of that email shows a reply stating, \u201cEmbassy Kyiv \u2014 coordinated with our USAID mission folks \u2014 will have detailed input tomorrow.\u201d One email involving Nuland was sent two days before the loan guarantee was signed on June 3, 2016. \u201cCan you confirm who will be doing the actual signing for each side?\u201d the exchange asked. Nuland has come under repeated fire for her various roles in the anti-Trump dossier controversy. FBI notes also cite career Justice Department official Bruce Ohr as saying that Nuland was in touch with Fusion GPS co-founder and dossier producer Glenn Simpson. Sen. John McCain, who infamously delivered the dossier to then-FBI Director James Comey, reportedly first dispatched an aide, David J. Kramer, to inquire with Nuland about the dossier claims. In their book, Russian Roulette: The Inside Story of Putin\u2019s War on America and the Election of Donald Trump, authors and reporters Michael Isikoff and David Corn write that Nuland gave the green light for the FBI to first meet with Steele regarding his dossier\u2019s claims. It was at that meeting that Steele initially reported his dossier charges to the FBI, the book relates. Meanwhile, looped into email chains with Ciaramella was then-Secretary of State John Kerry\u2019s chief of staff at the State Department, John Finer. An extensive New Yorker profile of Steele named Finer as obtaining the contents of a two-page summary of the dossier and eventually deciding to share the questionable document with Kerry. Finer reportedly received the dossier summary from Jonathan M. Winer, the Obama State Department official who acknowledged regularly interfacing and exchanging information with Steele, according to the report. Winer previously conceded that he shared the dossier summary with Nuland. After his name surfaced in news media reports related to probes by House Republicans into the dossier, Winer authored a Washington Post oped in which he conceded that while he was working at the State Department he exchanged documents and information with Steele. Winer further acknowledged that while at the State Department, he shared anti-Trump material with Steele passed to him by longtime Clinton confidant Sidney Blumenthal, whom Winer described as an \u201cold friend.\u201d Winer wrote that the material from Blumenthal \u2013 which Winer in turn gave to Steele \u2013 originated with Cody Shearer, who is a controversial figure long tied to various Clinton scandals. In testimony last year, Nuland made statements about a meeting at the State Department in October 2016 between State officials and Steele, but said that she didn\u2019t participate. At a June 2018 hearing, Sen. Richard Burr (R-NC) revealed contents of the State Department\u2019s visitor logs while he was grilling Nuland. At the hearing, Burr asked: \u201cI know you talked extensively with our staff relative to Mr. Steele. Based upon our review of the visitor logs of the State Department, Mr. Steele visited the State Department briefing officials on the dossier in October of 2016. Did you have any role in that briefing?\u201d \u201cI did not,\u201d Nuland replied. \u201cI actively chose not to be part of that briefing.\u201d \u201cBut were you aware of that briefing?\u201d Burr asked. \u201cI was not aware of it until afterwards,\u201d Nuland retorted. Nuland did not explain how she can actively chose not to be part of Steele\u2019s briefing, as she claimed, yet say she was unaware of the briefing until after it occurred. Nuland was not asked about the discrepancy during the public section of the testimony, which was reviewed in full by Breitbart News. Nuland previously served as chief of staff to Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott under Bill Clinton\u2019s administration, and then served as deputy director for former Soviet Union affairs. Nuland faced confirmation questions prior to her most recent appointment as assistant secretary of state over her reported role in revising controversial Obama administration talking points about the 2012 Benghazi terrorist attacks. Her reported changes sought to protect Hillary Clinton\u2019s State Department from accusations that it failed to adequately secure the woefully unprotected U.S. Special Mission in Benghazi. Likely \u2018whistleblower\u2019 A RealClearInvestigations report by investigative journalist and author Paul Sperry named Ciaramella as best fitting the description of the so-called whistleblower. Officials with direct knowledge of the proceedings say Ciaramella\u2019s name has been raised in private in impeachment depositions and during at least one House open hearing that was not part of the formal impeachment proceedings. Federal documents show Ciaramella also worked closely with Joe Biden and worked under Susan Rice, President Obama\u2019s national security adviser. He also worked with former CIA Director John Brennan, an anti-Trump advocate who has faced controversy for his role in fueling the questionable Russia collusion investigation.\u00a0 Rice participated in Russia collusion probe meetings and reportedly unmasked senior members of Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. Sperry cites former White House officials saying Ciaramella worked for Biden on Ukrainian policy issues in 2015 and 2016, encompassing the time period for which Biden has been facing possible conflict questions for leading Ukraine policy in light of Hunter Biden\u2019s work for Burisma. Mark Zaid and Andrew Bakaj, the activist attorneys representing the so-called whistleblower, refused to confirm on deny that their secretive client is indeed Ciaramella. \u201cWe neither confirm nor deny the identity of the Intelligence Community Whistleblower,\u201d the lawyers told the Washington Examiner in response to an inquiry about Ciaramella. Zaid and Bakaj added, \u201cOur client is legally entitled to anonymity. Disclosure of the name of any person who may be suspected to be the whistleblower places that individual and their family in great physical danger. Any physical harm the individual and/or their family suffers as a result of disclosure means that the individuals and publications reporting such names will be personally liable for that harm. Such behavior is at the pinnacle of irresponsibility and is intentionally reckless.\u201d On Sunday, Trump responded to press reports naming Ciaramella, calling him a \u201cradical\u201d known for his close ties to Brennan and Rice. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll tell you what. There have been stories written about a certain individual, a male, and they say he\u2019s the whistleblower,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201cIf he\u2019s the whistleblower, he has no credibility because he\u2019s a Brennan guy, he\u2019s a Susan Rice guy, he\u2019s an Obama guy.\u201d Trump added, \u201cAnd he hates Trump. And he\u2019s a radical. Now, maybe it\u2019s not him. But if it\u2019s him, you guys ought to release the information.\u201d Aaron Klein is Breitbart\u2019s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

      "subtitle": "Republican lawmakers are quietly discussing whether to call Joe and Hunter Biden as witnesses in the event of an impeachment trial in the Senate, the\u00a0Washington Post reports.",
      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " House Democrats passed a partisan impeachment inquiry resolution last week aimed to outline the procedures in their inquiry moving forward \u2013 an inquiry that was never officially authorized by a full House vote. While House Democrats are moving forward with the inquiry under what Republicans say is the guise of transparency, Senate Republicans are quietly preparing for the possibility of a trial in the Senate and weighing if they should call the Bidens as witnesses, if it comes to that point. Per the Washington Post: Among a group of Trump\u2019s allies inside and outside Congress, there is intense and growing interest in countering the House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry with their own scrutiny of Hunter Biden\u2019s overseas business dealings in Ukraine and China. Because his father was vice president at the time, these allies believe it could be a way of explaining why Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a July 25 phone call to \u201clook into\u201d the Bidens, who have denied any wrongdoing. Democrats launched the inquiry after a so-called \u201cwhistleblower,\u201d believed to be\u00a0Eric Ciaramella, issued a complaint despite lacking firsthand knowledge of President Trump\u2019s July 25\u00a0phone call with Ukraine President\u00a0Volodymyr Zelensky. Ciaramella reportedly \u201cinterfaced about Ukraine with individuals who played key roles in facilitating the infamous anti-Trump dossier produced by Fusion GPS and reportedly financed by Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee,\u201d as Breitbart News reported. The \u201cwhistleblower\u2019s\u201d concerns and subsequent reactions from mainstream media outlets and Democrats prompted the White House to release transcripts of the phone call, which Democrats claimed proved quid pro quo. They used it as a catalyst to launch an impeachment inquiry, which they had been itching to initiate but were unable to do after the Mueller report indicated that there was no collusion or conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia. At the crux of the phone call is Trump\u2019s concern of the former vice president\u2019s actions, who appeared to engage in quid pro quo himself after threatening to withhold $1 billion in aid unless Ukrainian officials stopped a prosecutor\u2019s investigation into Burisma Holdings, where Hunter Biden was making $83k per month. \u201cI said, I\u2019m telling you, you\u2019re not getting the billion dollars. I said, you\u2019re not getting the billion. I\u2019m going to be leaving here in, I think it was about six hours. I looked at them and said: I\u2019m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you\u2019re not getting the money,\u201d Biden recalled during an appearance at the\u00a0Council on Foreign Relations last year. \u201cWell, son of a bitch. He got fired,\u201d\u00a0Biden triumphantly stated. Republicans are debating whether it would be wise to use the impeachment trial, if it comes to that point, to shine a light on the corruption of the Bidens in regards to their dealings in both Ukraine and China. According to the Post, Sens. Rand Paul (R-KY) and John N. Kennedy (R-LA) proposed the idea. According to the report: That effort gained steam on Capitol Hill last week at a private lunch where Republican Sens. Rand Paul (Ky.) and John N. Kennedy (La.) raised the idea of summoning Hunter Biden, according to two people familiar with the exchange who, like others in this article, spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Paul took his private push public at a campaign rally with the president Monday night in Kentucky. \u201cI say this to my fellow colleagues in Congress, to every Republican in Washington: step up and subpoena Hunter Biden and subpoena the whistleblower!\u201d Paul told the crowd, also referring to the unnamed intelligence official who first raised alarms about the president\u2019s Ukraine conduct. However, some GOP lawmakers remain skeptical. \u201cI think that\u2019s a sideshow,\u201d Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) said, according to the Post. \u201c[Impeachment] is a very solemn and serious constitutional process, and I just think that whatever the House decides to vote on .\u2009.\u2009. that\u2019s what we ought to consider and not make this any more of a reality show than it\u2019s likely to become,\u201d he continued. Senate Judiciary Committee Lindsey Graham (R-SC) did not explicitly say whether he would support calling the Bidens as witnesses in a Senate impeachment trial, but confirmed he would not call them to the Judiciary Committee. \u201cI don\u2019t have jurisdiction over Hunter and Joe Biden, so we\u2019re not going to call them at the Judiciary Committee,\u201d he said, according to the Post. \u201cThat\u2019s just not proper. I don\u2019t have jurisdiction and I\u2019m an institutional guy,\u201d he added. While the debate rages on, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) indicated on Tuesday that, if the trial were held today, the Senate would acquit the president. \u201cI will say I\u2019m pretty sure how it\u2019s likely to end,\u201d McConnell\u00a0told\u00a0reporters. \u201cIf it were today, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question \u2014 it would not lead to a removal.\u201d",

      "author": "Edwin Mora",
      "content": " The firm\u2019s overall efforts to secure a meeting with the State Department and improve Burisma\u2019s image in Washington came amid Ukraine\u2019s corruption investigations into the Ukrainian company and its founder, Mykola Zlochevsky. Hunter served on Burisma\u2019s board of directors from 2014 until April of this year. The Obama administration cleared Hunter to work for the Ukrainian company despite having received warnings that the company was corrupt from a top U.S. State Department official. According to the email exchanges between State Department staffers, Karen Tramontano, the chief executive of the firm Blue Star, mentioned Hunter\u2019s position within Burisma in trying to secure a meeting with a senior official at the State Department. The Wall Street Journal noted: In the contacts with the State Department, Ms. Tramontano said that Burisma hadn\u2019t engaged in corruption and wanted to change the view of the company in Washington. The former official said that Hunter Biden\u2019s position on the board wasn\u2019t the reason that [the State Department] took the meeting and that no further action was taken after it took place. State and Blue Star declined the Journal\u2019s request for comment. The government released the emails in response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request submitted by Southeastern Legal Foundation, a conservative public interest nonprofit, on behalf of John Solomon, who shared the obtained information with the Journal. On Tuesday, the Journal reported: The documents\u2014email exchanges between State Department staff members made public this week\u2014show that the consulting firm, Washington-based Blue Star Strategies, used Hunter Biden\u2019s name in a request for a State Department meeting and then mentioned him again during the meeting as part of an effort to improve Burisma\u2019s image in Washington. \u2026 It isn\u2019t clear whether the younger Mr. Biden knew his name was being used by Blue Star in its contacts with State Department officials on Burisma\u2019s behalf in early 2016. A lawyer for Mr. Biden didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. In 2015, the Obama administration \u201crebuffed\u201d warnings from the top State Department official who oversees policy towards Ukraine, George Kent, that Burisma was corrupt, the\u00a0Washington Post reported on October 18. Kent made the revelation while giving a deposition in the Democrat\u2019s impeachment inquiry on October 15. At the heart of the probe is a \u201cwhistleblower\u201d complaint accusing President Donald Trump of pressuring Ukraine to investigate Burisma-linked corruption allegations against the Bidens, allegedly in exchange for aid. Trump, Ukraine, and some impeachment probe witnesses have denied the existence of the alleged quid pro quo at the center of the inquiry in which Trump coerced Ukraine to investigate the Bidens in return for U.S. security assistance. Meanwhile, however, some witnesses have \u201cpresumed\u201d that a quid pro quo did take place, citing second-hand knowledge. Hunter worked for Burisma when his father, while serving as vice president, was charged with overseeing U.S. policy towards Ukraine, prompting corruption accusations by Republicans. Hunter\u00a0admitted\u00a0to ABC News that his father\u2019s political position helped him secure the lucrative appointment to Burisma\u2019s board of directors. Joe Biden gloated about pressuring Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor in 2016 who had been investigating corruption allegations against Burisma and its owner.",

      "author": "Edwin Mora",
      "content": " Taylor\u2019s October 22 depostion behind closed doors suggests Trump did not threaten to withhold aid during the infamous July 25 call between him and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky that ultimately triggered the impeachment inquiry. \u201cJuly 25th is a week after the hold was put on the security assistance. And [on] July 25th, they had a conversation between the two presidents, where it was not discussed,\u201d Taylor declared under questioning from Rep. John Ratcliffe (R-TX). Ratcliffe then asked, \u201cTo your knowledge, nobody in the Ukrainian Government was aware of the hold?\u201d \u201cThat is correct,\u201d Taylor replied. Ukraine did not find out there was a hold on U.S. aid until over a month after the call, Taylor testified. The U.S. ultimately released the aid on September 11 without Ukraine having to do anything as part the alleged quid pro quo. Ratcliffe explained to Taylor: So the idea of a quid pro quo is a concept where there is a demand for action or an attempt to influence action in exchange for something else. And in this case, when people are talking about a quid pro quo, that something else is military aid. So, if nobody in the Ukrainian Government is aware of a military hold at the time of the Trump-Zelensky call, then, as a matter of law and as a matter of fact, there can be no quid pro quo, based on military aid. Taylor did not dispute Ratcliffe\u2019s explanation of a qui pro quo, acknowledging that he is not a lawyer. The Ukraine ambassador was not even on the July 25 call at the center of the impeachment probe. Citing Ratcliffe, President Donald Trump tweeted on October 23, \u201cNeither he [Taylor] or any other witness has provided testimony that the Ukrainians were aware that military aid was being withheld. You can\u2019t have a quid pro quo with no quo.\u201d  House Democrats pursuing the impeachment inquiry are trying to determine if Trump\u00a0abused his power\u00a0by allegedly coercing Ukraine during the call to investigate corruption allegations against Joe Biden and his son Hunter in exchange for aid. Trump, Zelensky, and some impeachment inquiry witnesses have denied the existence of a quid pro quo. Meanwhile, however, other impeachment probe witnesses, including Taylor, have presumed that a quid pro quo did take place, citing second-hand information. Ratcliffe asked Taylor during his deposition, \u201cBased on your knowledge, nobody in the Ukrainian Government became aware of a hold on military aid until two days later, on August 29th.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s my understanding,\u201d Taylor replied. Taylor\u2019s concerns of a quid pro quo stem from conversations with other Trump administration officials, not the July 25 call. There are no transcripts of those conversations to confirm or contradict Taylor\u2019s characterization of what was said. In a complaint filed August 12, a \u201cwhistleblower\u201d accused Trump of making a quid pro quo offer to Zelensky on July 25 in which the U.S. president pressured his Ukrainian counterpart to launch a probe into the Bidens in exchange for aid. Hunter and Joe Biden have denied any wrongdoing. Although the complaint is at the heart of the impeachment inquiry, there are signs House Democrats are trying to move beyond the July 25 call on Ukraine.",

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) did not fall far behind, garnering 20 percent support. Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) came in fourth but down by double digits with just nine percent support. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), who is desperately attempting to revive her spiraling campaign by going \u201call-in on Iowa,\u201d came in fifth place, garnering five percent support. Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) and Andrew Yang (D) followed with three percent support each. The remaining candidates saw two percent support or less.

The poll, taken November 3-5, 2019, among 1500 individuals (1201 registered voters), showed Sanders in third place with 14 percent support, followed by Buttigieg with eight percent and Harris with six percent.

      "subtitle": "U.S. diplomat Bill Taylor, during his deposition last month, identified the New York Times as the sole source of his claim that President Donald Trump wanted Ukraine to help him get dirt on Joe Biden, transcripts released Wednesday show.",
      "author": "Edwin Mora",
      "content": " Taylor suggested that Trump wanted Ukraine to launch investigations into corruption allegations against the former vice president and his son Hunter and potential U.S. election interference only to get information on his political rival Joe Biden. The U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Taylor, revealed that the Times was the only source for his reasoning. Besides a New York Times article, \u201cI have no other information from what the [U.S.] president was thinking,\u201d he declared under questioning by Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-NY) during his October 22 deposition, given behind closed doors. The transcripts of his testimony described the Zeldin-Taylor exchange as follow: Zeldin: What was the goal of requesting investigations into 2016 election and [Ukrainian company that employed Hunter] Burisma? Taylor: As I understand it from one of the maybe the article in the New York Times about [Trump\u2019s private lawyer] Mr. [Rudy] Giuliani\u2019s interest in Burisma, in that article, he describes, and I think he quotes Giuliani at some length, that article indicates that Giuliani was interested in getting some information on Vice President Biden that would be useful to Mr.Giuliani\u2019s client. I think that\u2019s what he says. He says he\u2019s got one client, and he\u2019s useful to the client. Zeldin: And then it\u2019s your inference that Mr. Giuliani\u2019s goal would be the President\u2019s goal? Taylor: Yes. Zeldin: And your source is the New York Times? Taylor: Yes. Zeldin: So do you have any other source that the President\u2019s goal in making this request was anything other than the New York Times? Taylor: I have not talked to the president. I have no other information from what the President was thinking. Hunter Biden served on Burisma\u2019s board of directors from 2014 until April of this year. The Obama administration cleared Hunter to work for the Ukrainian company\u00a0despite\u00a0having received warnings that the company was corrupt from a top U.S. State Department official. The former vice president pushed Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor in 2016, who had been investigating Burisma, prompting corruption allegations. Zeldin highlighted his exchange with Taylor on Twitter.  House Democrats conducting the impeachment are trying to determine if Trump abused his power by allegedly coercing Ukraine into investigating Biden, his son, and potential 2016 U.S. election interference to benefit then-Democrat candidate Hillary Clinton. Taylor said he was not aware of news reports suggesting there was 2016 election interference at the hands of Ukrainian officials, adding that he did not even bother to seek out information to further his understanding of the allegations. When asked to read some of those news reports during his deposition, he acknowledged some Ukrainian officials likely engaged in U.S. election interference, echoing written testimony from former American special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing,\u201d Taylor testified on October 22, referring to the revelations in the news reports. At the heart of the impeachment probe is a \u201cwhistleblower\u201d complaint citing second-hand information accusing Trump of engaging in a quid pro quo in which he leveraged aid to Ukraine to pressure the country to investigate the Bidens. Trump, Ukraine, and some impeachment inquiry witnesses have denied the claims. Meanwhile, however, other impeachment probe witnesses, including Taylor, have presumed that a quid pro quo took place based on second-hand information.",

      "author": "John Nolte",
      "content": " This to me, from the far-left Politico, is a remarkable story. \u201cThe threat of California\u2019s progressive boo birds is reason enough for Joe Biden to skip the state\u2019s giant Democratic Party convention next week,\u201d reports Politico. \u201cBut the added layer of risk in getting onstage with Jorge Ramos, the immigration rights-crusading Univision news anchor and moderator of a candidate forum at the convention, also played a role in the campaign\u2019s discussions about skipping the largest single state gathering of Democrats.\u201d Politico adds. The story goes on to point out that, already in this primary, Ramos has \u201crepeatedly tripped up\u201d Biden in the past over the Obama administration deporting illegal aliens \u2014 as it was, you know, required to do by law. \u201cBiden\u2019s camp as well as some neutral Democratic observers are convinced Ramos would look for a similar moment at the convention, which will be packed with progressive immigration activists.\u201d Someone Politico describes as a \u201cDemocratic consultant familiar with the Biden campaign strategy\u201d explained Biden\u2019s cowardice this way, \u201cIt\u2019s not that we\u2019re scared. But we\u2019re not stupid.\u201d Right. The official Biden campaign excuse is scheduling conflicts. Elizabeth Warren is also not attending, and has not said why. Warren, however, did attend the Democrat\u2019s convention in June and a number of Democrat National Committee meetings over the summer. Biden did not show up for either. To ask the question is to answer the question: If Joe Biden is afraid of getting booed and knows he can\u2019t handle Jorge Ramos, if he\u2019s afraid of hostile voters and hostile open borders-advocates like Ramos, how will he handle North Korea or Russia or Syria \u2026 or Trump? A few days ago, on national television, we all watched President Trump walk into a Nationals baseball stadium filled with the predominantly-white, wealthy, big city leftists who hate his guts. He knew he would be booed. He showed up anyway. Almost every day, outside the White House, Trump confronts and mixes it up with a corporate media that despise him, plots with the Democrats and Deep State against him, lies about, smears him\u2026 No Republican president has ever been this accessible to the media. Hell, no Democrat president has, either. Remember when Jorge Ramos finally came right out and admitted he was an open borders extremist while heckling Trump during the 2016 primary? Sure, Trump booted Ramos out for heckling him, and should have, but then Trump allowed him back in and took multiple questions from him, faced him down, showed his mettle. If Biden, a former vice president for crying out loud, is afraid of getting booed and can\u2019t handle some tough questions from Ramos, how is he going to handle a Donald Trump who will never be cowed by the media (like McCain and Romney were) to lay off damaging subjects the media declare off limits. There is nothing Biden can do to avoid the boos or tough questions. But that\u2019s not the point. The point is that Biden needs to prove to voters that he can handle the boos and tough questions, that he can keep his composure in the face of adversity, be the alpha male, is unafraid of being challenged, and can at least beat a fanatic like Ramos to a draw. Running like a little girl, like a coward, is a terrible choice, a revealing choice from an old man, long past his prime, whose only hope of squeaking to a primary win is to hug the ball and run out the clock.

      "content": " David Hale, the undersecretary of state for political affairs, testified behind closed doors. His testimony echoed comments by his two superiors \u2014 Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\u00a0and Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan \u2014 who have denied the alleged quid pro quo at the center of the impeachment inquiry. Neither Pompeo nor Sullivan have testified in the impeachment inquiry. \u201cJust finished with Ambassador David Hale\u2019s testimony, the number 3 at the State Department, and a distinguished public servant,\u201d Meadows, who witnessed Hale\u2019s testimony, wrote on Twitter Wednesday. \u201cHe made a compelling case that there was absolutely no linkage between [the] suspension of military aid and political investigations.\u201d  House Democrats pursuing the partisan impeachment probe are trying to find out whether Trump abused his power by holding up military aid to Ukraine to allegedly pressure Kiev to launch investigations that could have benefited the U.S. president politically. White House hopeful Joe Biden and his son Hunter are linked to one of the corruption investigations sought by Trump. Both Joe and Hunter Biden deny any wrongdoing. The Trump administration ended up releasing the aid to Ukraine on September 11 without the Eastern European country having to do anything in return. Hale is the first witness to show up for his testimony in the impeachment probe this week. Several White House witnesses have refused to testify, even under subpoena, after the White House directed them to skip their deposition. Energy Secretary Rick Perry, Acting Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Russ Vought, and Ulrich Brechbuhl, the State Department counselor, declined to testify Wednesday. Hale reportedly testified for about six hours. Democrats are beginning to wrap up the closed-door portion of their investigation, saying they will hold public hearings next week. The impeachment inquiry came after a so-called \u201cwhistleblower\u201d\u00a0issued a complaint accusing Trump of coercing Ukraine to conduct the investigations in exchange for aid during a July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The \u201cwhistleblower\u201d lacked firsthand knowledge of the conversation. Trump, Zelensky, and some impeachment probe witnesses have denied the \u201cwhistleblower\u2019s\u201d allegation of a quid pro quo, considered the crux of the investigation. Citing second-hand information, however, other witnesses have presumed that a quid pro quo took place in which Trump pushed Ukraine to investigate the Bidens and 2016 U.S. election interference in exchange for aid. Pompeo has accused House Democrat impeachment investigators of harassing department employees by requesting their testimony. Some State Department officials, meanwhile, have accused Pompeo of not doing enough to protect department employees during the ongoing impeachment probe. On Wednesday, the Associated Press noted: People familiar with the matter said Hale, the highest-ranking career diplomat in the foreign service, planned to say Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and other senior officials determined that publicly defending ousted Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch would hurt the effort to free up U.S. military assistance to Ukraine. Some State Department officials have testified that they opposed the dismissal of Yovanovitch, which came at the behest of Trump. The U.S. president has the authority to remove any of his ambassadors.",

      "subtitle": "The Obama administration allowed former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter to continue working for Ukrainian company Burisma, even after learning that the firm and its owner were corrupt, top U.S. State Department official George Kent testified, according to transcripts released Thursday.",
      "author": "Edwin Mora",
      "content": " Hunter served on Burisma\u2019s board of directors from 2014 until April of this year. In 2014, the U.S. spent hundreds of thousands in American taxpayer funds on assisting an investigation into corrupt activities linked to Burisma owner Mykola Zlochevsky, Kent revealed. During his closed-door deposition on October 15, Kent told House impeachment investigators that he raised concerns about Biden\u2019s lucrative position in 2015. According to the transcripts, Kent, a deputy assistant secretary charged with overseeing U.S. policy towards Ukraine, testified: The first time I was in Ukraine as acting deputy chief of mission in the period of mid-January to mid-February 2015, subsequent to me going into the deputy prosecutor general on February 3rd and demanding who took the bribe and how much was it to shut the case against Zlochevsky I became aware that Hunter Biden was on the board. I did not know that at the time. And when I was on a call with somebody on the vice president\u2019s staff and I cannot recall who it was, just briefing on what was happening into Ukraine I raised my concerns that I had heard that Hunter Biden was on the board of a company owned by somebody that the U.S. Government had spent money trying to get tens of millions of dollars back and that could create the perception of a conflict of interest. The United States spent \u201croughly half a million dollars\u201d in support of a Zlochevsky-linked investigation in 2014 \u2014 the year Burisma hired Hunter, Kent revealed. Kent indicated that then-VP Biden\u2019s staff dismissed his concerns about Hunter\u2019s work in Ukraine. \u201cThe message that I recall hearing back was that the vice president\u2019s son Beau Biden was dying of cancer and that there was no further bandwidth to deal with family related issues at that time,\u201d he testified. \u201cThat was the end of that conversation\u201d about Hunter Biden\u2019s conflict of interest in Ukraine, Kent later added. Kent said he first visited the U.S. embassy in Ukraine in mid-January 2015. He indicated that he soon learned Burisma was corrupt. \u201cBurisma had a reputation for being, first of all, one of the largest private producers of natural gas in Ukraine but also had a reputation for not being the sort of corporate, cleanest member of the business community,\u201d the top State official said. He testified that he was so concerned about Burisma\u2019s reputation that he put the breaks on coordinated activity between the company and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). House Democrats pursuing the impeachment probe have accused Trump of abusing his power by pressuring his Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during a July 25 call to investigate corruption allegations against the Bidens, allegedly in exchange for aid. Trump, Zelensky, and some impeachment probe witnesses, including Kent, have denied the claim. Other witnesses, however, have presumed that a quid pro quo took place in which Trump leveraged U.S. aid to pressure Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. Kent testified that he had no \u201cdirect knowledge\u201d of the alleged link between America\u2019s security assistance to Ukraine and the Eastern European country opening of new investigations. He also told investigators that it is appropriate for the Trump administration to \u201clook at the level of corruption\u201d in foreign countries like Ukraine when determining whether to provide or withhold aid. The former vice president\u00a0threatened\u00a0to withhold aid himself to Ukraine to force the Eastern European country to fire its top prosecutor in 2016, who had investigated the owner of Burisma for possible corruption. Until recently, Hunter served on the board of Burisma for up to\u00a0$83,000\u00a0per month despite having no background in energy. His position prompted allegations of corruption. Hunter\u00a0admitted\u00a0to ABC News last weekend that his father\u2019s political position helped him secure the lucrative appointment to Burisma\u2019s board of directors. Based on Kent\u2019s testimony, Trump had reason to be concerned about corruption linked to Hunter Biden\u2019s position.",

      "content": " Last week, RealClearInvestigations reported\u00a0the alleged identity of the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d as a CIA analyst who had worked with Biden, and who had interacted at the White House with a person who approached Ukraine for dirt on Trump during the 2016 elections. The\u00a0Washington Examiner reported Thursday: Biden co-hosted the banquet with former Secretary of State John Kerry for then-Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi. [Eric] Ciaramella, who is of Italian heritage, was among the U.S. officials who accepted an invitation. \u2026 Ciaramella, 33, is listed among dozens of other people who were invited to the October 2016 event hosted by Biden under the category \u201cWH EOVP,\u201d or the White House Executive Office of the Vice President, in an unclassified State Department document released through the Freedom of Information Act. An \u201cA\u201d appears next to his name, indicating he accepted the invitation. \u2026 Besides inviting Ciaramella, Biden\u2019s office, as opposed to the State Department or another entity, sent invitations to more than thirty other people, including Obama press secretary Josh Earnest, Obama senior adviser Valerie Jarrett, Obama Homeland Security adviser Lisa Monaco, Obama speechwriter Ben Rhodes, and Obama national security adviser Susan Rice. RealClearInvestigations named Ciaramella as the whistleblower last week. The report cites U.S. officials who said the invite to Ciaramella, \u201ca relatively low-level GS-13 federal employee, was unusual and signaled he was politically connected inside the Obama White House.\u201d Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, left, reaches to tap glasses with Vice President Joe Biden, during a toast by Secretary of State John Kerry, center, during a luncheon in his honor, Tuesday, Oct. 18, 2016, in the Ben Franklin Room at the State Department in Washington.

The \u201cwhistleblower\u201d claimed the president had tried to force the Ukrainian government to dig up dirt on Biden during a phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

      "subtitle": "The United States Senate is probing whether a lobbying firm working on the behalf of Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian oil and gas conglomerate, leveraged the company\u2019s ties to Hunter Biden for access to the State Department.",
      "author": "Haris Alic",
      "content": " Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA), the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday asking his department to provide all records pertaining to Hunter Biden, Burisma, and any intermediaries. In particular, Grassley requested the State Dept. provide further information about meetings Blue Star Strategies, a Washington, D.C. based lobbying and public relations firm, sought with U.S. officials in 2016 to discuss public corruption allegations against Burisma. The letter comes after a Freedom of Information ACT (FOIA) lawsuit revealed representatives of Blue Star Strategies specifically invoked Hunter Biden, who at the time sat on Burisma\u2019s board of directors, when trying to secure the meeting. At the time, Burisma and its founder, Mykola Zlochevsky, were under suspicion for money laundering and public corruption. The allegations stem from Zlochevsky\u2019s tenure as Ukraine\u2019s minister of ecology and natural resources in the early 2010s, where it is purported he used his position to approve oil and gas licenses for Burisma. Grassley\u2019s letter was sent in conjunction with Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI), the chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee. Both men have taken a keen interest in Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings overseas and the potential conflicts of interest they may have posed for his father, former Vice President Joe Biden, throughout his tenure in the Obama administration. In this instance, Grassely and Johnson are investigating whether the meeting with Blue Star and U.S. officials ever took place and if it influenced Obama administration policy towards Ukraine. Only one month after the meeting request was made, then-Vice President Biden issued an ultimatum to then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko: either the government fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, or the U.S. would rescind upwards of $1 billion in aid. According to Biden\u2019s official recollection of the incident, he issued the ultimatum on behalf of then-President Barack Obama, who had lost faith in Shokin\u2019s ability to root out corruption. Unofficially, though, it was well known that that Shokin was ramping up his investigation into both Burisma and Zlochvesky. Shokin\u2019s probe had progressed far enough that he was able to convince the Ukrainian courts in early 2016 to seize Zlochvesky\u2019s remaining assets in the country. The oligarch only evaded arrest because he was already hiding abroad after having fled Ukraine in 2014, when a pro-western uprising toppled his allies in the country\u2019s then-pro-Russian government. Adding to the appearance of conflicting interests behind the former vice president\u2019s decision to oust Shokin is that the prosecutor has\u00a0claimed\u00a0he was preparing to interview Hunter Biden about his Burisma tenure when he was fired. The revelations come into the spotlight as questions mount as to how Hunter Biden was able to secure an appointment to Burisma\u2019s board in the first place. As Peter Schweizer, senior contributor at Breitbart News,\u00a0detailed\u00a0in his book\u00a0Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends, Hunter Biden secured the position, which\u00a0paid\u00a0as much as\u00a0$83,000 per month, despite having no background in energy or Ukraine. Adding to the appearance of impropriety is the fact that\u00a0Hunter Biden joined Burisma at a time the company was seen as actively courting western leaders to prevent further scrutiny of its business practices. The same month the younger\u2019s Biden appointment was announced,\u00a0the government of Great Britain\u00a0froze\u00a0accounts belonging to Burisma founder Mykola Zlochevsky under suspicion of money laundering. Zlochevsky, a former Ukrainian minister of natural resources, would later be accused of\u00a0corruption\u00a0for using his office to approve oil and gas licenses to Burisma. A Ukrainian official with strong ties to Zlochevsky admitted in October the only reason that Hunter Biden secured the appointment was to \u201cprotect\u201d the company from foreign scrutiny. The claim has credence given that at the time Joe Biden, as the sitting vice president, was tasked with leading the Obama administration\u2019s policy towards Ukraine in response to Russia\u2019s invasion of Crimea. Hunter Biden, himself,\u00a0admitted\u00a0his father\u2019s political influence was the likely reason for his appointment to Burisma\u2019s board during a recent ABC News interview. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. Probably not, in retrospect,\u201d the younger Biden said when asked if he would have been tapped for the lucrative job had his father not been the sitting vice president. He quickly added, though, that\u00a0his family\u2019s political prominence had always played a large role in his dealings. \u201cBut that\u2019s\u2014you know\u2014I don\u2019t think that there\u2019s a lot of things that would have happened in my life if my last name wasn\u2019t Biden.\u201d",

Elizabeth\u2019s wealth tax, which only impacts America\u2019s 75,000 wealthiest families, would generate enough revenue to cover universal child care, quality public education, forgive student loan debt, provide free public college, and help finance Medicare for All. As reported in October, Bloomberg and Hillary Clinton have been reportedly keeping an eye on the Democrat primary, although many Democrats believe neither would officially jump into the race unless Joe Biden (D) flounders.",

      "subtitle": "Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder is again considering running for the Democrat nomination for president in 2020 after previously ruling out a run, a move that comes as former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg has filed presidential primary paperwork in Alabama signaling he may be a late entrant to the race.",
      "author": "Matthew Boyle",
      "content": " All of this comes as speculation builds that former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, the failed 2016 Democrat presidential nominee, may run again in 2020 as well. Holder did very publicly flirt with running in 2020 before, even making the rounds to travel to some early presidential states for key speeches, but he ultimately announced earlier this year he would not run. In March 2019, he came out and said he would not be running in 2020 and that he planned to instead focus his efforts on redistricting efforts. But now, given how weak the rest of the Democrat presidential field is in 2020, and with other top talent showing that the water is definitely still warm, Holder appears to be reconsidering and thinking about getting into the race after all. Washington Post columnist Eugene Robinson reported late Thursday evening that Holder has been discussing a late entrance into the crowded Democrat field with a handful of close advisers and political consultants:  The news that Holder is reconsidering his decision to bow out on 2020 comes as Bloomberg has filed paperwork in Alabama, which has a Friday filing deadline, to run for president. He has not yet, according to multiple reports, made a decision on whether he will run for president or not, but filing paperwork in Alabama ensures he would have a shot at ballot access there should he mount a national campaign for the Democrat nomination. Politico reported Thursday night: Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is preparing to file paperwork to qualify for the Democratic presidential primary in Alabama, ahead of a Friday deadline. The move would be a first step toward a national campaign, though Bloomberg has not made a final decision to run. Bloomberg aide Howard Wolfson is quoted in the story as well, suggesting that Bloomberg is actively considering jumping into the still-crowded 2020 Democrat presidential primary field. Wolfson said: We now need to finish the job and ensure that Trump is defeated \u2014 but Mike is increasingly concerned that the current field of candidates is not well positioned to do that. If Mike runs he would offer a new choice to Democrats built on a unique record running America\u2019s biggest city, building a business from scratch and taking on some of America\u2019s toughest challenges as a high-impact philanthropist. All of this comes as Clinton, whom some have speculated may get in herself, again toyed with the idea publicly during an interview with Andrew Ross Sorkin this week and then tweeted video of the joke:  Clinton, Bloomberg, and now Holder all considering late entrances to the crowded 2020 Democrat presidential primary field comes as its onetime frontrunner, former Vice President Joe Biden, has proven particularly weak against his opponents. Biden\u2019s deep corruption concerns with regard to his son Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealing in Ukraine and China, and potentially elsewhere around the world in shoes yet to drop, have Democrats concerned that a much more radical leftist like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) or Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) could win the Democrat nomination. While the hard left of the Democrat Party led by the so-called \u201cSquad\u201d believes that nominating a leftist socialist like Sanders or Warren would energize the party\u2019s base and bring an army to take on President Donald Trump and his base in November 2020, more establishment Democrats are concerned that Warren or Sanders being the nominee would turn off battleground voters and cede the White House back to Trump in 2020. Most of the \u201cSquad,\u201d\u00a0Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY),\u00a0 Ilhan Omar (D-MN), and Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) endorsed Sanders since the last Democrat debate in October, while the freshman group\u2019s fourth member Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) endorsed Warren. Members have insisted there is no divide in the group. Biden\u2019s polling numbers have steadily sunk in recent months, to the point where he has lost the frontrunner status he enjoyed at the beginning of his campaign. Warren has replaced Biden as the frontrunner in many national polls, and especially in several key battleground states. Biden\u2019s numbers keep slipping as the public learns more and more about his son\u2019s position on the board of Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma Holdings, where he was paid more than $80,000 per month. Questionable Hunter Biden dealings in China, too, have put a spotlight on Biden corruption concerns, all of which in their totality are a nearly daily national news story given the fact that House Democrats have decided to proceed with an impeachment inquiry into President Trump over the fact that Trump asked Ukraine\u2019s new president to investigate corruption including what happened with Hunter Biden and Burisma. If Bloomberg or Clinton decided to launch national presidential campaigns in the next few weeks, they would have considerable resources at the ready. Bloomberg, a billionaire, has immense financial resources at his disposal, while Clinton as the party\u2019s nominee in 2016 and the former first lady, as well as a leader with a national profile and universal name identification among voters, would quickly be able to assemble the structures necessary to compete in the upcoming primaries and caucuses. Holder, though, may have a rougher go of it given that he\u2019s never run a national campaign before and does not have the financial resources of Bloomberg:  Holder does have deep ties to former President Barack Obama, however, and is considered a favorite among the Democrat base given the work he did to help Obama cover up a variety of scandals, including most notably the Operation Fast and Furious scandal. Holder\u2019s coverup of documents on behalf of Obama, who asserted executive privilege to withhold the information from Congress, led to him being the first-ever and only sitting Attorney General of the United States to be held in contempt of Congress. The U.S. House in 2012 voted Holder into both civil and criminal contempt of Congress over the Fast and Furious scandal, just one of many scandals that plagued Holder\u2019s Department of Justice.",

      "author": "John Nolte",
      "content": " Those of you looking for even more proof that the establishment media have almost no impact on public opinion need only read on\u2026 Keep in mind that this a poll of 835 registered voters taken between October 30 and November 2, 2019 \u2014 or while Democrats and their media allies are on a 24/7 crusade to impeach Trump. Favorable / Unfavorable Donald Trump: 44 / 54 percent Quid Pro Joe Biden: 43 / 50 percent Bernie \u201cThe Fossil\u201d Sanders: 41 / 54 percent Cherokee Princess Elizabeth Warren: 42 / 44 percent Dingbat Kamala Harris: 27 / 46 percent Mean Little Mayor Pete Buttigieg: 27 / 34 percent If that is not interesting enough for you, since this poll was taken in late September, Trump\u2019s numbers have improved\u2026 Previously, he was at 43 percent favorable, 56 percent unfavorable. And guess whose numbers got worse, and I mean a whole lot worse\u2026 Yep, Slow Joe Biden\u2019s\u2026 Which, once again, proves that the Ukrainian torpedoes aimed at the Bad Orange Man went off course and nailed Old Joe. In September, before we learned how Joe and his son Hunter looted at least two foreign countries, Joe sat at 46 percent favorable, 45 percent unfavorable. That\u2019s a loss of eight net points while Trump gained three points. Granted, Trump is more upside-down than Biden, but only by three points (10 to 7), which is well within the margin of error. Buttigieg is also upside down by seven points, while Bernie is buried by 13 points and Kamala by 19 points \u2014 which is an accurate reflection of just how awful she is. One warning sign for Trump is that only 42 percent of those polled believe he deserves reelection, while 55 percent do not want him reelected. But even on this point, since September, Trump has improved from a 39 to 57 percent response. So he has been gaining ground \u2026 during impeachment! But here\u2019s the other thing\u2026 Even if 55 percent of the country wants Trump replaced in 2020, they have to replace him with someone else. There has to be an acceptable alternative, and what we have here is a Democrat field so weak, so extreme and unappealing, Big Guns like Michael Bloomberg and Eric Holder are seriously considering jumping in at this very late date. As far as impeachment, despite 24/7 negative news coverage and selective leaks, this pig just isn\u2019t going to fly. \u201cIt\u2019s important not to read too much into differences within the margin of error. But the fact that there is no significant change in the current results suggests that the opening salvo of the House impeachment inquiry has had little impact on the overall 2020 dynamic. Voter opinion remains baked in,\u201d said Patrick Murray, director of the independent Monmouth University Polling Institute. Ya think? According to the Real Clear Politics poll of polls, Trump currently enjoys a relatively healthy job approval rating of 44 percent, and the polls gauging impeachment have either stalled or are losing altitude. Monmouth has Trump\u2019s job approval at 45 percent. Most telling, at least in my opinion, is that impeachment has not boosted the cable news ratings. Far-left CNN is actually attracting fewer viewers when compared to last year. This shows an extraordinary amount of voter indifference towards impeachment. Americans just don\u2019t see impeachment as a big deal, as anything more than just another partisan food fight. If voters believed there was an actual crime here, cable news ratings would be through the roof, and Trump\u2019s favorability, reelect, and job approval ratings would not be on the upswing. Bottom line: this is the media fail of all media fails. Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC. Follow his Facebook Page here.",

      "subtitle": "The elite class and Hillary Clinton, specifically, are unsatisfied with the current Democrat primary field and have signaled their dissatisfaction in a variety of ways in recent weeks, from refusing to endorse former Vice President Joe Biden (D) to dismissing the ultra-far-left candidates\u2019 radical agendas.",
      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " There is no shortage of candidates in the current Democrat primary field. Democrats have, on paper, everything they have claimed to want in terms of diversity in their lineup. They have multiple women \u2014 Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Kamala Harris (D-CA), Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI), and self-help guru Marianne Williamson (D). They have candidates who represent racial minorities \u2014 Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) and\u00a0Juli\u00e1n Castro (D) \u2014 as well as a candidate who embodies their self-proclaimed devotion to the LGBT community. Yet, despite that, Democrat elites like Clinton are unsatisfied, indicating a deepening divide within the Democrat Party. The first presidential primary is less than three months away, yet select Democrats are still mulling a last-minute run. On Thursday, reports indicated that former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg filed presidential primary paperwork in Alabama, with sources adding that he is \u201cclose\u201d to coming up with a final decision on a presidential bid. Similarly, former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder is reportedly considering a long-shot bid, and Hillary Clinton has been teasing a run for weeks, failing to use her recent interviews to quash the rumors. It has been widely believed among Democrats that Bloomberg and Clinton would not run unless Biden, who was long believed to be the unshakeable frontrunner, showed signs of wavering. Both Warren and Sanders have managed to put a dent in his support, keeping potential candidates like Clinton on the fence and prepared to pounce. Bloomberg\u2019s, Holder\u2019s, and Clinton\u2019s purported considerations speak volumes about the state of the current Democrat field. Democrat elites are unsatisfied with the choices, fearing Biden\u2019s lack of stamina in a general election matchup against Trump and questioning the electability of Warren and Sanders, who have unabashedly embraced far-left proposals and positions that strategic Democrats, like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), have long attempted to keep at bay. Clinton has openly criticized the positions of Warren and Sanders, causing some to wonder if she is subtly attempting to undermine the field or in the very least, influence the candidates\u2019 positions. She appeared at the\u00a0New York Times\u2019\u00a0DealBook conference this week and took aim at ultra-wealthy tax proposals and Medicare for All \u2014 two progressive plans both Warren and Sanders not only support, but champion. \u201cI just don\u2019t understand how that could work, and I don\u2019t see other examples anywhere else in the world where it has actually worked over a long period of time,\u201d Clinton\u00a0said of the wealth tax proposals, calling them \u201ccomplicated.\u201d \u201cIf you were going to do a wealth tax and it was on assets \u2026 how you would value it is, I think, complicated to start with,\u201d she said. \u201cBut assume you can get some system of evaluation, people would literally have to sell assets to pay the tax on the assets that they owned before the wealth tax was levied,\u201d she continued. \u201cThat would be incredibly disruptive, so I think there are other ways to raise the revenues,\u201d she added. Clinton also expressed doubt that Warren\u2019s $52 trillion Medicare for All plan would ever pass. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d Clinton replied when asked if she thought Warren\u2019s plan would pass. \u201cI don\u2019t, but the goal is the right goal. \u201d \u201cI believe the smarter approach is to build on what we have, a public option is something I\u2019ve been in favor of for a very long time. I don\u2019t believe we should be in the midst of a big disruption while we are trying to get to 100 percent coverage and deal with costs,\u201d she added. Clinton has also taken direct aim at candidates like Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI), calling her a \u201cfavorite of the Russians\u201d and suggesting that she is a \u201cRussian asset.\u201d \u201cThey [Republicans] know they can\u2019t win without a third-party candidate, and so I do not know who it\u2019s going to be, but I can guarantee you they will have a vigorous third-party challenge in the key states that they most need it,\u201d Clinton said on the Campaign HQ podcast with Barack Obama\u2019s former campaign manager David Plouffe last month. Time and time again, rather than encouraging Democrats to rally behind a candidate in the existing presidential primary field, Clinton has subtly hinted that she could jump in the race instead. In October, President Trump tweeted that \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d should join the race \u201cto try and steal it away from Uber Left Elizabeth Warren\u201d as long as she explains \u201call of her high crimes and misdemeanors including how & why she deleted 33,000 Emails AFTER getting \u2018C\u2019 Subpoena!\u201d Clinton replied, \u201cDon\u2019t tempt me. Do your job,\u201d and fueled further speculation during an appearance on\u00a0PBS NewsHour. \u201cMaybe there does need to be a rematch. I mean, obviously, I can beat him again,\u201d she said. \u201cBut, just seriously, I don\u2019t understand. I don\u2019t think anybody understands what motivates him, other than personal grievance, other than seeking adulation.\u201d Clinton kicked off an additional 2020 buzz on social media after posting a quote from\u00a0Beyonc\u00e9 about the need to \u201ctake\u201d power: The twice-failed presidential candidate\u2019s book tour has almost doubled as an outlet to express her views on the 2020 race. She dropped yet another doubtful analysis of the current 2020 field during an event at Portland\u2019s Revolution Hall last month, suggesting that it would be nearly impossible for anyone in the current field to unseat Trump in the next election in the event that he is not impeached. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know who\u2019s going to be the best candidate to beat this president, assuming this president is still running,\u201d she said. She continued: We have a number of very able, very admirable candidates who are vying for the nomination, but at the end of the day, there are a lot of forecasters who are saying, \u2018Look, if the economy stays in good shape and he\u2019s not impeached, or he\u2019s impeached but not convicted, it\u2019s going to be very, very hard,\u2019 because of all of the advantages that he will have on the stuff we were just talking about like suppression and everything else. Her husband, former President Bill Clinton, has done little to extinguish the mounting rumors, explaining that his wife \u201cmay or may not ever run for anything\u201d during an appearance at Georgetown Law\u2019s second annual Ruth Bader Ginsburg Lecture in Washington, DC, last month. Most recently, Clinton dodged a question on whether she is planning a last-minute jump into the race, reverting to jogging jokes at the New York Times\u2019 DealBook conference. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, to run? You know, I have always been a very, very slow runner. I am embarrassingly slow,\u201d she said, continuing her bit. \u201cThere\u2019s been some teasing and some hinting that, maybe, you\u2019re sitting off in the wings here and waiting for some moment,\u201d Andrew Ross Sorkin said. Clinton, however, refused to answer the question directly:  Look, I think I would have been a really good president. I think I could have been a very effective leader. We have real divides in the country over all kinds of things, but I certainly, in my time in the Senate and secretary of state, worked really hard, as you say, to actually solve problems, not exacerbate them or ignore them. I would have done everything I could to try to get us positioned for the future. That\u2019s what a leader is supposed to do. Elections are supposed to be about the future and leadership should be about the future. I think I could have done a really good job. I think the last election was deeply flawed and that there were so many unprecedented problems in that election that it\u2019s almost hard to make sense of. Sources for both the New York Times and Washington Post have said that Clinton has not ruled out a presidential bid and is actively keeping an eye on it, which is overwhelmingly evident to those who have been tracking her latest remarks. The possible late entrances \u2014 from Clinton, Bloomberg, and Holder \u2014 indicate the growing worry over not only the direction of the Democrat field but the Democrat Party\u2019s ability to defeat Trump in 2020. While Democrat voters are more open to radical policies, such as Medicare for All and multitrillion dollar proposals to combat climate change, there are growing concerns that those proposals will not bode well for the left in a general election matchup. Despite that, Sanders, who remains a top-tier candidate, is boldly running with his multitrillion-dollar, big government proposals and has garnered support from three individuals largely demonstrative of the ideological divide within the party: Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), and Ilhan Omar (D-MN). Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s infamous feud with Pelosi over the summer was almost a foreshadowing of the internal strife to be seen within the Democrat Party in the presidential primary. There is an ongoing, although largely unsaid, matchup between establishment Democrats and the unabashedly socialist \u201cnew\u201d left. Ultimately, the Democrat establishment worries the progressive flank will hand Trump, and his MAGA agenda, four more years in the White House.",

      "author": "Edwin Mora",
      "content": " Schiff, the leader of the impeachment inquiry, repeatedly interrupted the Republicans, ordering the witness not to answer questions, according to the transcripts of Vindman\u2019s October 23 testimony unveiled Friday. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Schiff and Vindman\u2019s lawyer prevented the witness from answering several questions, including whom he spoke to after listening to the July 25 call between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky that triggered the impeachment efforts. The Democrats\u2019 potential obstructions of justice by ordering Vindman to leave out details while testifying under oath suggest that the White House National Security Council (NSC) official focused on Ukraine may have shared information about the call with the so-called \u201cwhistleblower.\u201d Some Republicans have accused Schiff of coaching and coordinating with the \u201cwhistleblower,\u201d believed to be anti-Trump, to damage the U.S. President. The \u201cwhistleblower\u201d met with Schiff\u2019s office. Another question sidelined by the Democrats was whether Vindman intentionally worked to undermine Trump\u2019s policy. \u201cYou are interrupting us, and we have questions. He has counsel who can tell him he\u2019s not to answer that,\u201d Rep. Jim Jordan from Ohio, the top Republican on the House Oversight and Reform Committee, told Schiff. Republicans accused Schiff of obstructing the impeachment probe by \u201ccoaching\u201d Vindman on what he could and could not say. Vindman is the director of European Affairs at the National Security Council (NSC) official who listened in on the July 25 call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, which ultimately triggered the impeachment probe. Jordan asked Vindman, \u201cWho else did you talk to following the July 25th call?\u201d \u201cI reached out to a group of counterparts and informed them of a call. And, frankly, the reasoning behind it, I don\u2019t think I could talk about in this context,\u201d Vindman replied. Rep. Swalwell (D-CA), one of Trump\u2019s fiercest critics, ordered Vindman to stop answering Jordan\u2019s questions, citing protecting the \u201cwhistleblower\u2019s\u201d identity as the reason. \u201cChairman, I want to object that the question\u00a0calls to reveal the whistleblower,\u201d Swalwell interjected as Vindman was trying to respond to the question. \u201cI\u2019m not asking about that, I\u2019m just asking who this gentleman shared this information with,\u201d Jordan proclaimed. Justifying the blockade against specific Republican questions, however, the Democrats argued that they were merely trying to prevent Vindman from disclosing the identity of the whistleblower. Col. Vindman, however, explicitly said in his opening remarks that he did not know who the whistleblower is and would not speculate on his identity. Current law only prohibits the intelligence community inspector general (ICIG) who received the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d complaint from revealing the leaker\u2019s identity, National Public Radio (NPR) reported this week, citing legal experts. Although the left-wing mainstream media refuses to do so, some conservative news outlets have mentioned the name of a CIA analyst floating around as the \u201cwhistleblower.\u201d The leaker\u2019s lawyers refuse to confirm or deny the name. Vindman\u2019s lawyers appeared obstructive when they prevented their client from answering questions relevant to the impeachment probe. Lawyers are allowed to coach their witnesses to a certain extent, but the judge or a moderator, which appears to be the role Schiff is taking, is supposed to be neutral. Former federal prosecutor Dan Richman, a professor at Columbia Law School, explained in an article published by Slate in March 2006: Lawyers are under an ethical obligation to avoid coaching a witness in such a way that would distort his testimony. A prosecutor who violated this code might not face criminal and civil contempt citation \u2026 but she could find herself in front of a state ethics committee. Rep. Devin Nunes from California, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, indicated that Schiff\u2019s interference during Vindman\u2019s deposition was unprecedented on Fox News. Coaching witnesses to leave details out can amount to obstruction of justice, the Washington Post reported in January 1999, citing a memo from House prosecutors in President Clinton\u2019s impeachment trial. House Democrat impeachment investigators have accused Trump of engaging in a quid pro quo during the July 25 call in which he pressured Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, in exchange for aid. Trump, Ukraine, and some impeachment probe witnesses have denied the allegation. Other witnesses, however, presumed that a quid pro quo took place, citing second-hand knowledge.",

      "subtitle": "Former U.S. President Donald Trump adviser Charles Kupperman\u2019s lawsuit asking the courts whether he should testify in the House impeachment probe forced Democrats to rescind their subpoena.",
      "author": "Edwin Mora",
      "content": " \u201cThe subpoena at issue in this matter has been withdrawn, and there is no current intention to reissue it,\u201d Democrats wrote in court filings, the Hill reported. On October 25, Kupperman, who served as a top aide for White House national security adviser John Bolton at the White House National Security Council (NSC),\u00a0filed a lawsuit essentially asking the courts to rule on whether he should abide by the House Democrat\u2019s subpoena, citing concerns that his testimony would inflict Constitutional damage on either the House or executive branch. Acknowledging that the lawsuit may take so long to settle that Kupperman may not have to testify, Democrats who want to rush the partisan impeachment inquiry pulled the subpoena. Democrats have indicated they want to vote on impeachment by Christmas. The leaders of the House Committees on Oversight and Reform, Intelligence, and Foreign Affairs conducting the impeachment inquiry attributed Kupperman\u2019s subpoena defiance to \u201cWhite House obstruction,\u201d in an October 26 statement. The Hill quoted an unnamed House Intelligence Committee official as explaining their decision Wednesday: There is no proper basis for a witness to sue the Congress in court to oppose a duly authorized congressional subpoena. Nevertheless, given the schedule of our impeachment hearings, a court process that leads to the dismissal of Dr. Kupperman\u2019s flawed lawsuit would only result in delay, so we have withdrawn his subpoena. The White House has said it will not cooperate in the impeachment probe. In a November 1st U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) memo released to the public Tuesday, the Trump administration argued that Democrat impeachment investigators\u2019 attempts to compel testimony from executive branch officials are \u201clegally invalid\u201d unless they allow government attorneys to accompany the witnesses. The assistance of government counsel is needed because testimony has the potential to disclose information \u201cprotected by executive privilege,\u201d the DOJ Office of Legal Counsel noted in a memo. While some officials did show up for their testimony, several White House officials bucked the House Democrats\u2019 subpoena to testify in the impeachment inquiry this week. Democrats are urging Kupperman\u2019s attorneys to convince the former Bolton aide to testify if the court rules in a separate case involving former White House counsel Don McGahn, who is questioning the courts as to whether he should testify. In both cases, the defendants argue that they have \u201cabsolute immunity\u201d from complying with congressional subpoenas, as suggested by DOJ. Kupperman is considered a prominent witness since he was on the infamous July 25 call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, considered the crux of the impeachment inquiry. It appears that the approach employed by Kupperman and his lawyers could serve as a blueprint for individuals who are not willing to testify in the impeachment probe, as it ended up pressuring the Democrats to drop their subpoena. House Democrats have asked Bolton to testify, but his attorney told the House investigators the former White House official would take the matter to court if he is subpoenaed, echoing the actions of Kupperman. Saying they ware waiting for the court to rule on McGahn, the Democrats have not issued a subpoena to compel testimony from Bolton. Resembling the position of Kupperman, Bolton has indicated he will testify, defying the White House, if the court compels him to do so.",

      "subtitle": "A Gallup poll that has tracked voter enthusiasm since 2000 shows Republicans with a small but noteworthy lead.",
      "author": "John Nolte",
      "content": " As of today, Republican enthusiasm sits at 65 percent, compared to 64 percent for Democrats. You might argue that a single point lead is meaningless. But here\u2019s the rub\u2026 It\u2019s not supposed to be like this. The party with the incumbent president is almost always running behind in voter enthusiasm. The reasons for this should be obvious: the other side is more juiced to win back the White House. Back in 2000, when Democrats were coming off two terms of Democrat Bill Clinton, the GOP had a 51 to 39 percent enthusiasm edge \u2014 12 points. In 2004, when Republican George W. Bush ran for reelection, Democrats had a 73 to 62 percent lead \u2014 11 points. In 2008, after two Bush terms, Democrats were up 73 to 59 percent \u2014 14 points. In 2012, as Democrat Barack Obama sought his second term, Republicans were up 70 to 59 \u2014 11 points. In 2016, after two Obama terms, the GOP was up 51 to 43 \u2014 8 points. In every case since 2000, the party out of power did not just enjoy a lead in enthusiasm, with the exception of 2016; it enjoyed a double-digit lead. But here we are going into 2020, and the party in power, the GOP, is not only plenty enthusiastic; it is in the lead. What\u2019s more, we are seeing a big jump since the 2018 midterms, a jump from 51 to 66 for the Republicans and a jump from 48 to 65 percent for Democrats. So what\u2019s different this time? A number of things\u2026 Unlike Bush Jr., Trump is determined to hold on to his base. Clinton and Obama governed this way. Bush did not, and the results of that, during his second term (Katrina plus immigration reform), were catastrophic. Trump has wisely embraced the Clinton/Obama game plan that says you always dance with them that brung ya. Secondly, of course, is this absurd and outrageous impeachment, which is being exposed every day as a full-blown Deep State-Media-Democrat coup, a straight-up conspiracy, and this is almost certainly creating a rallying effect around Trump. Finally, the Democrat presidential field is in every way terrible. Former Vice President Joe Biden is too old, represents the past, and not very bright. Elizabeth Warren is a non-starter with her pledge to strip 160 million Americans of their private health insurance as she more than doubles the federal budget with her $52 trillion \u2014 with a \u201cT\u201d \u2014 Medicare for All fiasco. Bernie Sanders is a 198-year-old commie with a bum ticker. There is no Barack Obama in this field. There is no Ronald Reagan. There is no Bill Clinton. There is no Donald Trump. There is no superstar who screams This Is the Future \u2014\u00a0just a bunch of old socialists. Alphas win presidential elections, and there is not an alpha in the bunch. On paper, and until she opens her mouth, Kamala Harris looks every inch the superstar. But she flamed out as soon as the spotlight revealed her crippling flaws and lack of intelligence. A word of caution: we don\u2019t know what this poll will look like a year from now. Nevertheless, it is more than noteworthy now, and it is difficult to imagine a scenario, other than a deep recession, that changes these numbers. But with most economic indicators on the upswing, a recession seems less likely than it did three months ago when the media were literally begging for a recession. In fact, it is much easier to game out scenarios where enthusiasm for Trump actually increases, especially if Democrats jump off that cliff and vote to impeach. This impeachment process is such an outrageous and infuriating abuse of power, so obscenely anti-democratic, and Trump will continue to be effective at communicating that point. It is also worth pointing out that this enthusiasm poll did not predict the outcome of the 2004 and 2012 elections. Democrats had an 11-point lead in \u201904, and Democrat John Kerry still lost to Bush. Republicans also had an 11-point lead in 2012, and Republican Mitt Romney still lost to Obama. But this might also reveal a couple of things in Trump\u2019s favor:\u00a0 1) it is difficult to knock out an incumbent president and 2) candidates matter. Kerry and Romney were terrible candidates, unappealing elitists backed by terrible campaigns. Trump, on the other hand, is a terrific campaigner, and from the looks of it, his Democrat opponent will be another Romney or Kerry. Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " The outlet obtained a list of witnesses selected by Republican lawmakers \u2013 a list which includes Hunter Biden and the so-called \u201cwhistleblower.\u201d \u201cAmericans see through this sham impeachment process, despite the Democrats\u2019 efforts to retroactively legitimize it last week,\u201d House Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes (R-CA) wrote to House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA), arguing that it is essential that the American people hear from witnesses \u2013 like Biden, Biden\u2019s business partner\u00a0Devon Archer, and the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d \u2013 in order to \u201cprovide transparency\u201d to Schiff\u2019s \u201cotherwise opaque and unfair process.\u201d GOP lawmakers believe Archer, who sat on the board of Burisma Holdings, where Biden was taking in tens of thousands of dollars per month despite a stunning lack of experience, will help America understand \u201cthe nature and extent of Ukraine\u2019s pervasive corruption information that bears directly on President Trump\u2019s longstanding and deeply-held skepticism of the country.\u201d They also believe it is essential for the so-called \u201cwhistleblower\u201d to testify. Nunes\u2019 letter continued: Because President Trump should be afforded an opportunity to confront his accusers, the anonymous whistleblower should testify. Moreover, given the multiple discrepancies between the whistleblower\u2019s complaint and the closed-door testimony of the witnesses, it is imperative that the American people hear definitively how the whistleblower developed his or her information, and who else the whistleblower may have fed the information he or she gathered and how that treatment of classified information may have led to the false narrative being perpetrated by the Democrats during this process. The list of potential witnesses also includes\u00a0Ukrainian American consultant for the Democratic National Committee (DNC)\u00a0Alexandra Chalupa and Fusion GPS researcher\u00a0Nellie Ohr. This follows reports of GOP lawmakers mulling if they will call either of the Bidens as witnesses in a potential impeachment trial in the Senate, as the former vice president\u2019s role in the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor probing into Burisma \u2013 where Hunter Biden was making\u00a0$83k per month \u2013 remains the focus of the Democrats\u2019 concerns over Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with\u00a0Ukraine President\u00a0Volodymyr Zelensky. \u201cI said, I\u2019m telling you, you\u2019re not getting the billion dollars. I said, you\u2019re not getting the billion. I\u2019m going to be leaving here in, I think it was about six hours. I looked at them and said: I\u2019m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you\u2019re not getting the money,\u201d Biden recalled during\u00a0an appearance at the\u00a0Council on Foreign Relations in 2018. \u201cWell, son of a bitch. He got fired,\u201d\u00a0he added. As Breitbart News reported, \u201cRepublicans are debating whether it would be wise to use the impeachment trial, if it comes to that point, to shine a light on the corruption of the Bidens in regards to their dealings in both Ukraine and China.\u201d According to the Washington\u00a0Post, Sens. Rand Paul (R-KY) and John N. Kennedy (R-LA) floated the suggestion. As Breitbart News reported, the partisan impeachment resolution passed by House Democrats gives Schiff unprecedented power, granting him the ability to stiff-arm attempts to call the younger Biden as a witness. Nunes issued a warning to Schiff in the letter: Because the Democrats\u2019 resolution unfairly restricts Minority rights and because you have provided no information about which witnesses you may invite to testify at future hearings not yet scheduled, we reserve our right to request additional witnesses, if necessary, as you announce additional hearings. \u201cYour failure to fulfill Minority witness requests shall constitute evidence of your denial of fundamental fairness and due process,\u201d he added.",

Biden\u2019s campaign immediately shredded what it called the \u201cmathematical gymnastics\u201d used in the proposal.

It makes us unattractive to powerful men who want us to be quiet,\u201d Warren\u2019s email read. The former vice president denied the implication during an interview with CNN\u2019s Dana Bash on Friday. \u201cThe strong women in my life are angry \u2014 they get angry about things.

      "content": " Look Before You Leap One can only imagine some of the last words heard by George Armstrong Custer as he rode to his fate at the Little Big Horn on June 25, 1876: Uh, Colonel, it looks like there are more of \u2019em than we were expecting. More Lakota and Cheyenne, that is. Uh oh. On the battlefield, situational awareness is a life-and-death thing. Today, 143 years later, as they ride onto a political battlefield\u2014The Battle of Impeachment\u2014perhaps the Democrats are now wishing they had started their mission with more situational awareness. Because right now, their battle plan doesn\u2019t look promising. In fact, the numbers from a November 5 Monmouth University poll are hitting on the Democrats like the fusillade of Sioux arrows and bullets aimed at Custer and his men. According to the poll, just 44 percent of Americans agree that Trump should be impeached and removed from the presidency, while 51 percent disagree. We should keep in mind that impeachment in the House requires a simple majority, while conviction (removal) in the Senate takes a two-thirds vote. So how far are the Democrats going to get on the basis of just 44 percent of the public? Moreover, the \u201cinternals\u201d in the Monmouth poll\u2014that is, the deeper numbers that drive the top-line numbers\u2014suggest more trouble ahead for the Democrats, because the data show deep skepticism about the basic fairness of the impeachment process. In the polite phrasing of the Monmouth pollsters, \u201cThe public is not very confident with the process to date.\u201d Yes, the internals show that\u2014and then some. Just 24 percent of those polled say they have \u201ca lot of trust\u201d in the House impeachment inquiry, while 29 percent have \u201clittle trust,\u201d and 44 percent have \u201cno trust at all.\u201d To put it another way, 73 percent of Americans\u2014almost three-quarters\u2014have little or no trust in what Pelosi, Schiff, & Co. are doing. And we might ask: As the impeachment process plods along, are people likely to become more trusting, or less trusting? For instance, there\u2019s the ongoing question of \u201cThe Whistleblower,\u201d who was introduced to the world by the Washington Post on September 18. Immediately, of course, people were curious to hear from the Whistleblower, whoever he or she was, as to the allegations about Trump and Ukraine. That seems fair, right? Indeed, September 25, just a week after that first report, CNN told us that the Whistleblower was willing to testify. That was encouraging, in terms of letting the sunshine in, and yet as the weeks went by and\u2026nothing. Then, on October 25, the Whistleblower\u2019s attorneys announced that there was no need for testimony, after all. And why not? Because, the lawyers said, his/her testimony \u201cis no longer relevant.\u201d Does that strike you as fair? Virgil neither. And we can further ask: Since when does one party get to decide a question such as this\u2014to testify, or not to testify? Shouldn\u2019t the accused, and the defenders of the accused, get the chance to cross-examine the accuser? That\u2019s a fundamental pillar of American jurisprudence. Yes, it sure seemed that the Whistleblower has been trying to have it both ways; that is, make the accusation against Trump, and yet never have to own up personally to the accusation. Did the Whistleblower have, maybe, something to hide? And how about the House Democrats who seem to have been working with the Whistleblower\u2014do they, too, have something to hide? Some off-line collusion, perhaps? Such unanswered questions, of course, further undermine public confidence in the process. (In the meantime, we have learned,\u00a0to our non-surprise, that the Whistleblower\u2019s lawyers have been strongly anti-Trump for years.) In fact, the Whistleblower has almost certainly been identified, and here at Breitbart News, too. So now a lot of inquiring minds are trying to tie together the loose threads about this fellow. For instance, on November 5, Mike Huckabee, a pro-Trump stalwart, put in print an interesting theory: that the Whistleblower and Anonymous are the same person. You remember Anonymous. That\u2019s the individual who wrote the op-ed in the New York Times on September 5, 2018, in which he/she/they claimed to be a \u201csenior official\u201d working as part of the anti-Trump #Resistance. At the time, some thought that Anonymous must be a cabinet official or some equally big cheese\u2014while others, of course, thought that the whole thing was a hoax. Yet now, maybe we are about to discover that Anonymous is just a thirty-something junior staffer at the CIA. If so, then the Times, which printed the op-ed with the assurance that it was written by a top dog, was, in fact, hoaxing its readers. That is, if this is all the handiwork of a junior CIA careerist, then that\u00a0underling cannot fairly be called a \u201csenior official.\u201d Of course, it\u2019s the Times, so what would we expect? Indeed, a pattern is starting to emerge; as\u00a0Virgil has been writing since December 2016, the Deep State has been targeting the Trump administration, and so maybe Anonymous and the Whistleblower are just different heads of the same hydra. More recently, of course, we\u2019ve learned that Anonymous will soon be publishing a book, on November 18, to be exact\u2013with a first run of a half-million copies. In fact, early excerpts from the book are already out, and they are, of course, not flattering to Trump. Still,\u00a0we must ask ourselves: Amidst all the hype, what do we know to be true about this author, and this book? What can be verified? Answer: not much, or, really, nothing. For all we know, the Anonymous book is just a bunch of b.s., even as, of course, it\u2019s given credibility\u2014if that\u2019s the right word\u2014because the Democrats and the MSM say so. As cynical wits say, In Washington, if an assertion is repeated three times, it\u2019s true. So could it be that the real story of the last three is that Anonymous, the Whistleblower, the Deep State, and leading elements of the MSM have been working together all along, as a sort of hive-mind, out to destroy Trump? Or is what we are seeing just a really sneaky marketing plan to sell books, and soon, too, maybe snag a movie deal? After all, Watergate proved to be a pretty good gig for Bob Woodward, Carl Bernstein, and many others\u2013they\u2019ve been dining out on it ever since. Amidst these mounting suspicions, the Whistleblower\u2019s lawyers now say that their client is willing to answer written questions, as long as they aren\u2019t too inquisitive; you know what that means. \u00a0 Maybe Anonymous, in conjunction with a Deep Statist or two, will be answering the questions. Fortunately, Republicans, in the White House and on Capitol Hill, have rejected all this stubborn cloaking\u2014labeling it for what it is: a cover-up. The Secret of Republican Success We can see from the aforementioned Monmouth poll that Republicans are winning the argument. Yes, sure, Democrats will manage to leak, every day, some bit of information that supports their case, but it\u2019s a safe bet that Republicans, every day, will have a response. That is, for every attack on Trump, there will be a defense\u2014and most likely a counter-attack. The key moment for rallying Republicans came on October 31, when the House voted to proceed toward impeachment. The vote among Democrats was 232:2, and yet among Republicans, it was 0:194. That is, GOPers were unanimous in their opposition. And as they say, unity is power. The power, that is, to keep a united front against Democrat witch-hunting. As Virgil wrote back on September 28, when the Ukraine story first broke, Republicans could either hang together, or hang separately. As he put it, \u201cThere\u2019s more safety, as well as strength, to be found in unity\u2014including the unity of staying on message.\u201d Happily, that\u2019s what Republicans have done. And by sticking together, they can make sure that the Democrat/MSM narrative is always confronted by a GOP/conservative counter-narrative. That counter-narrative reminds the public that Joe Biden has already admitted to meddling in Ukraine at the time his son was doing business there. Moreover, new grimy details keep dribbling out; we have just learned that Hunter Biden\u2019s Ukrainian associates were actively lobbying the State Department during the Obama-Biden administration. In other words, the Bidens were demonstrably doing what the Democrats have accused Trump of doing. And yet congressional Democrats want to impeach Trump? Shouldn\u2019t they be impeaching Biden first? And since it\u2019s easier to defend than to attack, Republicans have the easier task. It still takes courage to defend, of course, but it\u2019s more fun to be a Republican, in a defensive trench, than it is to be a Democrat, charging up\u00a0Impeachment Hill. Meanwhile, the GOP keeps getting new supplies of political ammo. For instance, a\u00a0new Harvard/Harris poll finds that 58 percent of Americans think that Hunter Biden showed \u201cbad judgment\u201d in his Ukrainian dealings. In the meantime, an AP-NORC poll finds that just 38 percent think Trump did something illegal, while 59 percent say that his actions, whatever else they might have been, were not illegal. To be sure, the facts about Ukraine are still emerging\u2013or at least, the something has been emerging. And that something isn\u2019t necessarily favorable to the Democrats\u2019\u00a0prosecution. For instance, Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-NY), tweeted\u00a0on November 7 that Marie Yovanovitch, the Obama administration\u2019s ambassador to that country, was not truthful in her answer to a question from the House Intelligence Committee about her contacts with Democrat operatives. Why, some might even dare to speculate that Yovanovitch might have committed perjury. Indeed, it\u2019s a safe bet that the facts about Ukraine\u2014plus, of course, non-facts and pseudo-facts\u2014will still be emerging, many years from now. Based on such debatable evidence, it\u2019s darn hard to see how Democrats can win their fight to impeach and convict Trump in late 2019 or early 2020. That\u2019s if, of course, Republicans keep a solid front\u2013as they seem to be doing. And surely the Democrats won\u2019t want to put themselves in the ridiculous position of letting this issue stretch out, such that they would be trying to remove Trump, even as they are running a presidential candidate to defeat him next November. If so, they would look like fools. Already, House Republicans have demanded that Schiff & Co. invite Hunter Biden to testify. The Democrats, enjoying their majority power, will, of course, say no\u2013they have their dump Trump plan already written, and they don\u2019t wish to deviate from the script. Yet such a refusal to call an obvious witness is not a good look for the Dems. Moreover, in the Senate, which must acquit or convict after impeachment, it will be a different story. Republicans, defending Trump, will have the majority, and so they call any witness they wish. So, hello, Hunter, and, while they\u2019re at it, why not invite Joe Biden? He might still be running for president next year\u2013if old age, or Mike Bloomberg, hasn\u2019t gotten to him, but that\u2019s his problem, as well as, of course, a problem for the Democrats. And who else might get called? John Kerry? After all, he was secretary of state from 2013-2017. Barack Obama? He was president, after all. So what was his policy toward Ukraine? Who else might get called? That\u2019s up to such Machiavellians as Mitch McConnell and Lindsey Graham. In other words, the Senate trial would likely be a circus\u2013a circus that would have the reverberation of Brett Kavanaugh hearings, only times 100. It would be a circus, that is, that out-thunders the presidential race. We might ask ourselves, which story would reporters rather cover and shows want to lead with: some candidate making a speech on health care, or, say, Ted Cruz and Kamala Harris going at it on the Senate floor? The media have learned by now that anything with \u201cTrump\u201d in it rates better than anything else. (The president is absolutely right when he says that the media will miss him when he\u2019s gone\u2013he\u2019s the man they love to hate, sure, but most of all, he\u2019s the man they love to cover.) So how did the Democrats get themselves into this situation? After all, they were certainly warned; Nancy Pelosi, to name one warner, said that impeachment could cost the Democrats, big-time, in 2020\u2014and that\u2019s why she dragged her feet for so long. But the hotheads won, and so here we are, as Impeachment \u201920 threatens to crowd out Election \u201920. Indeed, even after the House impeachment vote, friendly voices were advising the Democrats to cool it. We might recall some headlines, just from the last few days: \u201c1 big thing: How an impeached Trump wins\u201d; \u201cCNN\u2019s S.E. Cupp Sees \u2018Early Warning Signs\u2019 in Impeachment: \u2018Will Impeachment Help Trump?\u2019\u201d; and \u201cImpeachment a winner for Democrats? Don\u2019t bet on it.\u201d So yeah, Democrats had plenty of warning. Of course, Custer was warned, too\u2014and look what happened to him.",

      "subtitle": "South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg is the candidate most hated by his rivals for the Democratic Party\u2019s 2020 presidential nomination, according to a profile Saturday by the\u00a0New York Times.",
      "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
      "content": " The\u00a0Times reports\u00a0that other candidates resent Buttigieg\u2019s \u201cknow-it-all\u201d attitude, given his experience \u2014 and are jealous of his star power and fundraising prowess. In the still-crowded Democratic presidential field, one man has triggered an outpouring of resentment and angst. It\u2019s not Donald Trump. As Mr. Buttigieg, the millennial mayor of a town smaller than a New York City Council district, rises in the polls, he has struck a nerve with his Democratic rivals. Many of their campaigns have griped privately about the attention and cash directed toward Mr. Buttigieg. They say he is too inexperienced to be electable and that his accomplishments don\u2019t merit the outsize appeal he has with elite donors and voters. His public punditry about the race has prompted eye rolls from older rivals who view him as a know-it-all. And in a field where most candidates find themselves strapped for cash, they snipe at his ability to raise more than anyone else in the primary field except for Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. The\u00a0Times notes that Buttigieg irritated fellow candidates recently when he described the campaign as a two-way race between himself and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). Other nuggets: former Vice President Joe Biden once greeted Buttigieg, sarcastically, as \u201cMr. President.\u201d Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) said that if other candidates had run with as little experience as Buttigieg, \u201cI don\u2019t think people would take us seriously.\u201d Warren said Buttigieg was running a \u201cconsultant-driven campaign\u201d; Former HUD Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro said he Buttigieg did not appeal to minorities; Gov. Steve Bullock of Minnesota noted that Buttigieg had only won \u201c9,000 votes in a college town [South Bend] that last voted for a Republican in 1964.\u201d And as other reports have noted, Buttigieg is considered too mainstream for some radical LGBT activists. Buttigieg\u2019s rise has been unusual, and rapid. He graduated from Harvard, won a Rhodes scholarship, and worked as a management consultant for McKinsey. Inspired by his work for Barack Obama\u2019s campaign in Iowa in 2008, he joined the U.S. Navy Reserve. He ran for state treasurer in Indiana, and lost. He won the race for mayor in South Bend, and deployed to Afghanistan while serving his first term (unlike rival Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI), who resigned from a city council seat when she was called up for duty in Iraq). He came out as gay relatively recently. He was re-elected mayor and ran for the chairmanship of the Democratic National Committee in 2017, buoyed by support from Silicon Valley donors, but lost to former Labor Secretary Tom Perez. He is the first openly gay presidential candidate, a fact that has boosted his profile and fundraising, even though he has said that he is not running \u201cto be president of gay America.\u201d Buttigieg is very sharp, but his style is sometimes perceived as condescending. One repeated criticism from the right is that he likes to lecture conservatives on their supposed lack of Christian principles for failing to support government policies like a minimum wage, for example. He has also contrived a fight with Vice President Mike Pence, accusing him of being a religious extremist, though Pence has a long record of treating him respectfully. Support for Buttigieg has surged in Iowa, as he attempts to repeat Obama\u2019s strategy of shocking more established rivals in the caucuses there, and using that momentum to win elsewhere, even though his national polls remain somewhat low. The\u00a0Times notes that Buttigieg has been able to set up field offices in early primary states, making him a competitive candidate. Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

      "subtitle": "The 2020 Democrat presidential field is about to get locked by filing deadlines and that is making a lot of Democrats nervous.",
      "author": "John Nolte",
      "content": " If you want to run for president, it is a 50 state process that requires filing papers and whatever else is required to get on the ballot. Alabama\u2019s filing deadline passed last week. New Hampshire and Arkansas expire this week. The heavy hitters of Illinois, California, and Texas are just weeks away. Ohio and North Carolina arrive before Christmas. In other words, unless someone gets off the pot, the current 2020 crop of tired, old extremists is locked in forever. Which means one of them will face Trump in 2020, and a quick look around shows that Democrats are not happy about that. There are rumblings about former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg seriously considering taking the plunge. There\u2019s even talk about former Attorney General Eric Holder. And because she\u2019s a vampire who keeps coming back in terrible sequels, there\u2019s Hillary. No one knows what\u2019s going to happen, but it was not supposed to be like this\u2026 For the last four years, Trump has been smeared by the media and Democrats (but I repeat myself) as a crazed rapist, racist, and traitor owned by the Russians who must be impeached\u2026 Gee, 2020 should be a lay-up for Democrats; after all, we have all those Fox News polls proving Trump is down something like 99 points to every Democrat politician in America, including Ted Kennedy\u2019s corpse. Why so nervous, Democrats? Why so nervous, media? Why this search for a last-minute ringer when the walls are closing in on Drumpf fer realsies this time? Well, if there\u2019s one thing Democrats and the media (but I repeat myself) remember, it\u2019s how meaningless those polls were in 2020\u2026 And what I mean by \u201cremember\u201d is \u201cstill haven\u2019t come to terms with or accepted.\u201d Former Vice President Joe Biden is the great slight hope, has the best chance against Trump, and he\u2019s not only a walking-talking example of the physical and mental deterioration that awaits those of us lucky enough to live so long, no matter how much the media scream HOAX on his behalf, this Ukraine-China-Hunter thing is a real problem. Biden was a terrible candidate before he started operating just a notch above \u201czombie.\u201d Today he\u2019s not just a mess, his son Hunter\u2019s appallingly mercenary, greedy, and unethical business practices, his shameless looting of two countries while his sitting-vice president father led American policy there, is something the Trump campaign is already exploiting. Remember how Barack Obama\u2019s 2012 re-election team looked at the lay of the Republican presidential field and correctly guessed Mitt Romney would come out on top? It was a gamble, but with an unlimited pile of money, it really wasn\u2019t, and that unlimited pile of money allowed Team Obama to define Romney as a corporate raider even before he secured the nomination. It was a brilliant play on Obama\u2019s part, and it worked, and now Team Trump is doing the same to Biden. The far-left Politico reports\u00a0the Trump campaign has spent $287,000 just in Iowa on ads that blast Biden over Ukraine, and this pales compared to the money spent on ads targeting Biden on Facebook and YouTube. Biden is already getting roughed up and defined by Trump, his numbers in Iowa and New Hampshire are cratering, and while he\u2019s still in the lead nationally, he\u2019s nowhere near the safe zone of 35 percent. Regardless, Iowa and New Hampshire matter. If you lose there, your national lead evaporates mighty quick. And if Biden loses the nomination, that leaves the socialists Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders, or Pete Buttigieg, the 11-year-old mayor black people can\u2019t stand. Help us, Michael Bloomberg, you\u2019re our only hope\u2026 The New York Post\u2019s Michael Goodwin is a smart political observer immune to the conventional wisdom that is always wrong, and he thinks Bloomberg is a good bet for Democrats. He makes some good points, but Bloomberg\u2019s biggest problem \u2014 by far \u2014\u00a0 is that he has no natural constituency. For all his own problems, Biden has the working class and blacks. Warren and Sanders have the far-far-left. Buttigieg is making a serious play for the same kind of young people who fell in love with Obama. Who does Bloomberg have? He\u2019s a billionaire businessman, a pushing 80 technocrat\u2026 He might be seen as a \u201cmoderate\u201d in the Democrat Party, a centrist, but that is where he stands politically, which has zero to do with winning votes. Amy Klobuchar is a centrist \u2014 she\u2019s polling at 1 percent. John Hickenlooper is a centrist governor from the swing state of Colorado, he\u2019s already been forced to drop out. The term \u201ccentrist\u201d is meaningless without a constituency. Sure, never bet against a guy who can write a check for $52 billion, but already Bloomberg has said he would not even try to win Iowa and New Hampshire, which I guess is a strategy \u2014 a BAD Strategy. We have decades of data proving Iowa and New Hampshire matter. You either get shot out of one of those cannons or you are doomed. Ask Rudy Giuliani about this strategy. One of the most beloved politicians in 2008 doomed himself under the belief he could ignore Iowa and New Hampshire as he sat on his national and Florida lead and waited for the campaign to come to him. But by the time it did, he had collapsed in the polls. Yes, Democrats have every reason to be nervous, and after Republicans turn these impeachment hearings into The Joe and Hunter Biden Looted Ukraine and China Show, they will have even more reason.

      "content": " \u201cIf they don\u2019t call the whistleblower [to testify] in the House, this thing is dead on arrival in the Senate,\u201d Graham warned on Fox News\u2019s Sunday Morning Features, adding: I consider any impeachment in the House that doesn\u2019t allow us to know who the whistleblower is to be invalid because, without the whistleblower complaint, we wouldn\u2019t be talking about any of this. I also see the need for Hunter Biden to be called to adequately defend the president and if you don\u2019t do those two things, it\u2019s a complete joke. \u2026 It\u2019s impossible to bring this case forward in my view fairly without us knowing who the whistleblower is and having a chance to cross-examine them about any biases they may have.  On Saturday, Republicans submitted a list to House Democrats of eight witnesses they would like to testify as part of the chamber\u2019s impeachment probe. Former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter and the unnamed \u201cwhistleblower\u201d are on the list. Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA), the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee who submitted the list via a November 9 letter to Democrats, argued, \u201cBecause President Trump should be afforded an opportunity to confront his accusers, the anonymous whistleblower should testify,\u201d adding: Burisma has a reputation in Ukraine for corruption. According to public reporting, Burisma recruited Mr. [Hunter] Biden to its board to improve its public image at a time when Mr. Biden\u2019s father, [then] Vice President Joe Biden, was the Obama Administration\u2019s point person for Ukraine policy. \u2026 Mr. [Hunter] Biden\u2019s firsthand experiences with Burisma can assist the American public in understanding the nature and extent of Ukraine\u2019s pervasive corruption, information that bears directly on President Trump\u2019s longstanding, and deeply-held skepticism of the country. In response to what he described as the GOP\u2019s \u201csham\u201d request for witnesses, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), the head impeachment inquisitor, ruled out testimony by the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d and Hunter Biden. Both the anonymous leaker and Hunter Biden are at the heart of the impeachment probe. The \u201cwhistleblower\u2019s\u201d testimony would be \u201credundant and unnecessary,\u201d Schiff proclaimed in arguing against the leaker testifying. An August 12 \u201cwhistleblower\u201d complaint about Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky spurred the House impeachment inquiry. The complaint accuses Trump of engaging in a quid pro quo during the conversation in which the U.S. president attempted to pressure Zelensky to investigate corruption allegations against the Bidens, in exchange for aid. The Bidens deny any wrongdoing, as do Trump and Zelensky. Some impeachment probe witnesses have denied that a quid pro quo took place. Others have presumed that Trump did attempt to coerce Ukraine to investigate corruption allegations against the former U.S. vice president and his son. A top U.S. State Department official George Kent testified on October 15 that he warned the Obama administration in 2015 that the Ukrainian company that had hired Hunter the previous year, Burisma, was corrupt. The Obama administration ignored Kent\u2019s concerns, however, and allowed Hunter to continue working at Burisma from 2014 until this year. Kent is expected to testify in public, while Hunter Biden is not. Breitbart News has repeatedly noted that there are signs Democrats are engaged in a fishing expedition, trying to expand the impeachment inquiry beyond the initial cause for launching the probe \u2014 the alleged\u00a0quid pro quo during the Trump-Zelensky July 25 call. Now, the Democrats are seemingly trying to impeach Trump over \u201cextortion\u201d and \u201cbribery.\u201d Naming the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d as a witness in the impeachment probe could grant the leaker additional protections under the obstruction statute\u00a018 USC \u00a7 1513(e), which makes it a crime to retaliate against a witness. Citing legal experts, various news outlets, including the New York Times, Reuters, CNN, and National Public Radio (NPR), have determined that the law only prohibits the office of the intelligence community inspector general from revealing the \u201cwhistleblower\u2019s\u201d identity. The law does not bar Trump and GOP lawmakers from outing the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d to the public. Under the law, it is illegal to retaliate against a whistleblower or make his or her work environment hostile, but proving retaliation can be difficult, the news reports noted. It is also illegal to out the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d if he or she is a covert agent. House Democrats pursuing the impeachment probe are expected to hold their first public hearing Wednesday.",

      "content": " The survey, taken\u00a0November 6 \u2013 10, 2019, among 1,134 New Hampshire likely Democratic primary voters, showed former Vice President Joe Biden (D) taking a surprising lead in New Hampshire with 20 percent support. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) came in second with 16 percent support, and Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D), who has been experiencing a surge in Iowa, bypassed Sanders, taking third place with 15 percent support. Sanders, who in recent weeks appeared to be bouncing back in the early primary state, fell to fourth place with 14 percent support. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) experienced a notable boost, seeing six percent support. Andrew Yang (D) followed with four percent support, and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Tom Steyer (D) saw three percent each. No one in the field garnered two percent, leaving the remainder of the field with one percent support or less. The\u00a0margin of error is +/- 3.8 percentage points:  \u201cNew Hampshire has mountains. Iowa has plains. They couldn\u2019t be more different except for the results of the last two Quinnipiac University polls, which both show 4 candidates in the top tier,\u201d Quinnipiac University Polling Analyst Tim Malloy stated, warning that the state\u2019s lineup is \u201cfar from rock solid.\u201d \u201cAlthough Biden has a slight lead in the Granite State, it\u2019s far from rock solid, and both states are clearly still up for grabs,\u201d Malloy added. Quinnipiac also asked 636 New Hampshire likely Democratic primary voters if they would support Michael Bloomberg. Only two percent signaled they would \u201cdefinitely\u201d support him, while 37 percent said they \u201cwould consider voting for him.\u201d The majority, 54 percent, said they \u201cdefinitely would not vote for him.\u201d The margin of error for that question is +/- 5 percent. \u201cIf he truly is in, there is a lot of work to do. But with vast resources to draw from, Michael Bloomberg\u2019s nascent campaign could morph from \u2018under construction\u2019 to \u2018full steam ahead\u2019 in a New York minute,\u201d Malloy said.",

      "author": "Edwin Mora",
      "content": " Even left-wing mainstream media outlets\u2014CNN, the New York Times, National Public Radio (NPR), and Reuters \u2014 determined that, certainly, no law prohibits President Donald Trump or members of Congress from disclosing the name of the leaker who sparked the impeachment inquiry. CNN acknowledged on November 8, \u201cIt is true no law explicitly prevents anyone, other than the IG [inspector general] and their staff, from revealing the name of a whistleblower.\u201d On November 6, National Public Radio (NPR) added: In recent days, President Trump and his allies have amplified their calls for the whistleblower who sparked the impeachment inquiry to be identified, presenting the question of whether it would be a crime for the president to unmask the anonymous whistleblower.\n\nAccording to four former top federal government officials who worked in intelligence and national security [even under former President Barack Obama], the answer is no. \u2026Similarly, if a news outlet, member of Congress or member of the public outed the whistleblower, legal experts said, no criminal law would be violated. \u201cThere is no overarching protection for the identity of the whistleblower under federal law,\u201d said Dan Meyer, a lawyer and the former executive director of the intelligence community whistleblower program. \u201cCongress has never provided that protection.\u201d Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA) acknowledged that much, threatening via Twitter on November 6 to introduce legislation to make identifying the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d illegal.  \u201cIt is completely clear that no one else has any legal obligation to protect the whistleblower\u2019s identity at all. Such would be a blatant violation of the First Amendment even past the lack of statutory requirement,\u201d Red State noted. On October 3, the New York Times acknowledged: The legal prohibition on disclosing the [\u201cwhistleblower\u201d] name applies only to [Intelligence Community IG Michael] Atkinson. It does not bar Mr. Trump and his allies from trying to identify him or disclosing his name if they figure it out. (It would be illegal under the Intelligence Identities Protection Act for any official to disclose his name if he is a covert agent, but no one has suggested that he is.) The Times goes on to note that the officials who gave information to the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d are \u201cprobably not\u201d guaranteed anonymity or protected from reprisals. Although it is not illegal to name the leaker behind the impeachment probe, there could be some repercussions for those who out the \u201cwhistleblower,\u201d NPR warned, adding: A member of Congress who reveals the whistleblower\u2019s identity could be removed from committees or face other legislative sanctions; a member of the public risks a civil lawsuit from the whistleblower\u2019s legal team, which has threatened to hold anyone who reveals the name personally liable if the disclosure results in harm to the whistleblower or the person\u2019s family. Workplace retaliation against the whistleblower following disclosure would constitute a federal crime. The bottom line is, Trump and members of Congress are exempt from criminal charges from revealing the \u201cwhistleblower\u2019s\u201d name, but Donald Trump Jr. may not. \u201cOnce the [\u2018whistleblower\u2019] complaint is out of the inspector general\u2019s hands the law does little to guarantee the whistleblower anonymity, said McClanahan, the executive director of National Security Counselors, a public interest law firm,\u201d according to Reuters. Trump outing the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d could be considered a form of retaliation. Still, it would not violate any laws, Robert Litt, the former general counsel for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence under Obama, told NPR. In 2014, American lawmakers formally put into law a directive from former U.S. President Barack Obama that supplemented the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act (ICWPA) of 1998 to protect IC \u201cwhistleblowers\u201d from workplace retaliation. However, John Cohen, a former official in the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), recently told Reuters the directive \u201cdoes not necessarily prevent disclosure of the identity of the whistleblower, which may subject the individual to retaliation from others.\u201d On August 12, the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d lodged a complaint with IG Atkinson about a July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate corruption allegations against his political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, in exchange for aid, the leaker claimed. The Bidens, Trump, and Zelensky have all denied any wrongdoing. Left-wing mainstream media outlets are refusing to release the name of the \u201cwhistleblower.\u201d On October 30, however, Real Clear Investigations suggested that anti-Trump CIA analyst Eric Ciaramella is the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d behind the complaint at the heart of the impeachment probe. The Washington\u00a0Examiner noted, however, that no one has been able to provide a definitive confirmation that Ciaramella is indeed the leaker, adding that other names have surfaced as possible suspects. Ciaramella\u2019s name appears in at least one of the transcripts of closed-door testimony provided by impeachment probe witnesses.",

      "author": "Charlie Spiering",
      "content": " The campaign mobilized against Los Angeles Times reporter Evan Halper for mistakenly quoting Buttigig as referring to the \u201cfailures of the Obama era\u201d on the campaign trail, a quote weaponized by his political rivals to damage his campaign. The snafu prompted Buttigieg to recommit his support for the former president on Twitter. \u201cMy appreciation of the great leadership of Barack Obama comes from a very personal place,\u201d he wrote on Twitter.  But Buttigieg\u2019s line about the \u201cfailures of the old normal\u201d include former President Obama, which he reminds political audiences, led to the Trump presidency. The South Bend mayor also spoke about Obama during a conversation with journalist John Heilemann about his campaign. \u201cI also don\u2019t believe we can go back, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s going back to Obama, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s going back to Clinton,\u201d he said in a clip posted by Mediaite\u2019s Tommy Christopher on Twitter.  In November, Buttigieg even claimed he had more executive experience than Obama did in 2007 when he ran for president. \u201cHe had more national exposure sooner than I did. But then I have the benefit of executive experience. So I guess we\u2019re just different,\u201d he told the Atlantic. Since announcing his presidential campaign, Buttigieg has tried to emphasize the contrast with former Vice President Joe Biden (and current senators) by arguing to voters they are part of a \u201cnormal\u201d political system that produced President Donald Trump. \u201cWe are not going to be able to meet this moment by recycling the same arguments, policies, and politicians that have dominated Washington for as long as I have been alive,\u201d Buttigieg said in the first night of the Democrat presidential primary debates in July. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to summon the courage to walk away from the past and do something different.\u201d The effort to appear \u201cdifferent\u201d was part of Obama\u2019s emphasis in the 2007 Democrat presidential primary until his campaign finally caught fire in Iowa and won him the state. Buttigieg even compared his improbable run for president to Obama\u2019s campaign for president, during a speech at the\u00a0Liberty and Justice Celebration dinner\u00a0in Iowa. \u201cThe first time I came to this state was as a volunteer, to knock on doors for a presidential candidate \u2013 a young man with a funny name,\u201d he said. \u201cWe knew the stakes were high then. The stakes are colossal now.\u201d Commentators have observed that Buttigieg is clearly a student of Obama\u2019s\u00a0upset run against failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, by echoing the same rhetoric and offering a break from the past. While Buttigieg wants to break from candidates like former Vice President Joe Biden, he does not want to break from the Obama legacy that he hopes to inherit. It\u2019s a strange paradox of running against the establishment while sounding like the establishment \u2014 at least the politics that Obama established in 2007.",

      "author": "Haris Alic",
      "content": " When the impeachment frenzy began in September, the former vice president was still leading his Democrat rivals by solid margins, according to national and state polls. Weeks of revelations about\u00a0influence peddling\u00a0in the Obama-era State Department and the conflicts of interest between the former vice president\u2019s office and the business interests of his youngest son, Hunter, however, have taken their toll. This was first evidenced by the Biden campaign\u2019s fundraising troubles and has more recently been exhibited by the former vice president\u2019s slippage in the polls. Since starting this campaign in late-April, Biden has\u00a0dropped\u00a0from leading his fellow 2020 Democrats by as much as double digits in Iowa, New Hampshire, and Nevada. A poll released from Iowa in late-October\u00a0showed\u00a0the former vice president in fourth place, trailing not only Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Warren (D-MA), but also South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Since that time, two other polls have also shown Biden firmly in fourth place, according to polling data compiled by Real Clear Politics. A similar situation has played out in New Hampshire,\u00a0where Biden once led by more than\u00a015 percentage points, the former vice president has been eclipsed by neighboring state rival, Warren. In fact, Biden had not led Warren in the first primary state in any poll taken between mid-September and November.\u00a0 That trend was only broken on Monday when a Quinnipiac Poll found the former vice president with a four percentage point advantage over Warren in New Hampshire. Although Biden\u2019s campaign was quick to laud the poll as proof their campaign was rebounding, they failed to mention that the former vice president\u2019s lead was exactly within the margin of error. Biden has also faltered nationally in the race for the Democrat nomination, although to less of a degree. In the weeks after Biden first announced his campaign, he led the field by as much as\u00a032 percentage points. In comparison, a Quinnipiac Poll from October\u00a0found\u00a0the former vice president trailing Warren, 21 percent to 28 percent, respectively. A similar Quinnipiac Poll taken just before the most recent Democrat presidential primary, which most\u00a0pundits\u00a0agreed was not Biden\u2019s best performance, had seen Warren\u00a0leading\u00a0the former vice president more narrowly, 30 percent to\u00a0 27 percent. Several national polls from the past week continue to show Biden in decline. A Monmouth University poll conducted between October 30 and November 3, found the former vice president in a statistical tie with Warren, with both Democrats pulling 23 percent of the vote. Likewise, a poll conducted by The Economist and YouGov between November 3 through November 5 showed Biden with narrow one point advantage, well within the margin of error, over Warren. Not only are Biden\u2019s fortunes dropping in the race for the Democrat nomination, but his viability for the general election is also taking a hit. When Biden first entered the 2020 race, most polls had him leading the president by wide margins. In June, alone, a Quinnipiac Poll had Biden leading Trump in a head-t0-head matchup by 13 percentage points, 53 percent to 40 percent. Now the former vice presidents leads Trump narrowly, often within the margin of error. An Emerson poll conducted in October, indicated Biden only had a one percentage point advantage over Trump, 51 percent to 49 percent, in a hypothetical general election. The Morning Consult found a similar trend in its national polling data. In between June and October, Trump was able to cut Biden\u2019s lead in a potential general election by half. In June, the Morning Consult\u2019s poll found Biden with an 11 point advantage over the incumbent. The same poll conduct at the end of October found the former vice president only leading Trump by five percentage points. The president\u2019s ability came from improved numbers among women and voters between the ages of 18-to-29 years of age\u2014two demographic groups essential to a Democrat\u2019s retaking the White House in 2020. Biden\u2019s drop in the polls has occurred as his son\u2019s wheeling and dealing in Ukraine has come to for-front of the impeachment inquiry. The controversy started when Trump\u00a0suggested\u00a0the Ukrainian government probe how Hunter Biden secured an appointment to the board of directors of Burisma Holdings, an eastern European oil and gas Ukrainian government probe Hunter Biden\u2019s role with Burisma Holdings. The younger Biden joined the company in 2014 around the same time his father was appointed to oversee Obama administration policy in Ukraine. As Peter Schweizer, senior contributor at Breitbart News,\u00a0detailed\u00a0in his book\u00a0Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends, Hunter Biden secured the position, which\u00a0paid\u00a0as much as\u00a0$83,000 per month, despite having no background in energy or Ukraine. Adding to concerns is the fact that at the time Hunter Biden joined Burisma, the company was seen as actively courting Western leaders to prevent further scrutiny of its business practices. The same month Hunter Biden was tapped for the group\u2019s board, the government of Great Britain froze accounts belonging to Burisma founder Mykola Zlochevsky under suspicion of money laundering. Not only had Zlochevsky had his assets frozen in Great Britain, but the former Ukrainian minister of natural resources was also facing suspicions of public corruption at home. Zlochevsky would later be\u00a0charged\u00a0with corruption for using his ministerial office to approve oil and gas licenses to companies under his control. It is in the context of Burisma and Zlochevsky\u2019s legal troubles that Joe Biden\u2019s political influence has raised the most red flags. The former vice president has particularly drawn questions over his conduct in demanding the Ukrainian government fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, in 2016. Joe Biden, who has publicly\u00a0bragged\u00a0about the firing, reportedly threatened to withhold more than one billion\u00a0dollars in U.S. aid if the Ukrainian government did not remove Shokin. He has claimed the demand came from then-President Barack Obama, who had allegedly lost faith in the prosecutor\u2019s ability to tackle corruption. Unofficially, though, it was known that Shokin was investigating both Burisma and Zlochevsky for public corruption. It is uncertain if the probe extended to Hunter Biden, although Shokin has recently admitted that prior to his ouster he was\u00a0warned\u00a0to back off the matter. Regardless of what occurred, Shokin\u2019s successor, who is now himself being\u00a0investigated\u00a0for public corruption,\u00a0dropped the investigation into Burisma and Zlochevsky. Although the former vice president and his son have denied any wrongdoing, voters do not seem to be buying their arguments. A recent poll by the Associated Press found that 69 percent of Americans believe Hunter Biden\u2019s work on behalf of Burisma was inappropriate. Furthermore, a Harvard/Harris poll taken at the same time showed that a 51 percent of Americans think the younger Biden should return any money he made through his ventures in Ukraine.",

      "author": "Haris Alic",
      "content": " Biden, who is one of the only 2020 Democrats to come out in opposition to the universal health care proposal, was asked during a televised CNN town hall in Iowa about criticisms he made regarding Warren\u2019s \u201celitist\u201d brand of politics. The former vice president made the remarks last week in a self-published Medium piece after Warren suggested he was running in the wrong presidential primary because he was unwilling to support Medicare for All. \u201cLet\u2019s get something straight, she attacked me,\u201d Biden said when asked about the dust up. \u201cShe went out and said\u2026Biden is a coward, Biden is\u2026and she went down the list of saying I should be in a Republican primary. What do you call that?\u201d The former vice president defended his decision to write the Medium piece, saying there was an \u201cattitude that exists\u201d in the country right now that \u201cif you disagree with me, you must be bad.\u201d Despite the pleas for civility and understanding, Biden proceeded to lambast Warren\u2019s views and attitude as \u201celitist\u201d and condescending once more. Although the moderator, CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett, attempted to push back against Biden\u2019s comments, what ended up being lost in the mix was that the former vice president had started the altercation over Medicare for All. Earlier this month, Biden accused Warren of lying about the true costs of Medicare for All and how she would pay for it during an interview with \u201cPBS News Hour.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s making it up,\u201d the former vice president said when asked about cost estimates Warren\u2019s campaign had released on the proposal. \u201cLook, nobody thinks it\u2019s $20 trillion. It\u2019s between 30 and $40 trillion. Every major independent study that\u2019s gone out there, that\u2019s taken a look at this, there is no way \u2014 even [Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT)], who talks about the need to raise middle-class taxes, he can\u2019t even meet the cost of it.\u201d Even prior to the interview, Biden\u2019s campaign had been pressuring Warren for months to explain how she would cover the costs associated from Medicare for All, which some estimate could run upwards of $32 trillion, without raising taxes on the middle class. When the Massachusetts Democrats did finally answer that question with a detailed proposal, Biden\u2019s campaign jumped to claim she was promising to raise taxes on middle class families, even though Warren expressly pledged in her plan there would be \u201cno middle class tax increases.\u201d \u201cFor months, Elizabeth Warren has refused to say if her health care plan would raise taxes on the middle class, and now we know why: because it does,\u201d Kate Bedingfield, the former vice president\u2019s deputy campaign manger, said at the time.\u00a0\u201cSenator Warren would place a new tax of nearly $9 trillion that will fall on American workers.\u201d Warren, herself, responded to the attack while campaigning in Iowa by accusing the former vice president of \u201crepeating Republican talking points\u201d on Medicare for All to the benefit of insurance companies and the pharmaceutical industry. \u201cIf anyone wants to defend keeping those high profits for insurance companies\u2026drug companies\u2026and not making corporations pay a fair share in taxes,\u201d the senator said, \u201cthen I think they\u2019re running in the wrong presidential primary.\u201d Warren, in part, was echoing her progressive rival from Vermont, Sanders, with the attack. In July, Sanders had publicly accused Biden of parroting\u00a0GOP talking points in an effort to undermine the credibility of Medicare for All. \u201cObviously what Biden was doing\u00a0is what the insurance companies and the pharmaceutical industries, Republicans, do: ignoring the fact that people will save money on their health care because they will no longer have to pay premiums or out-of-pocket expenses,\u201d\u00a0Sanders, who authored the initial Medicare for Al bill in 2017, told The New York Times over the summer. Regardless if the rebuke had partially been used before, Warren\u2019s suggestion that Biden should be running as a Republican sent the former vice president\u2019s team spinning. Biden\u2019s campaign manager, Greg Schultz, even\u00a0claimed Warren has no right to question his Democrat credentials since she herself was a Republican until the age of 47-years-old.  When that attack failed to get traction, Biden penned his Medium piece, accusing Warren of brandishing an \u201celitist\u201d and \u201ccondescending\u201d brand of politics that was eroding the national discourse. Although the former vice president never once mentioned Warren in the piece, his rigorous defense of expanding the Affordable Care Act through a public option left little to the imagination. The flare-up between the two camps underscores the precarious position Biden finds himself in three months away from the first nominating contest in Iowa. Although the former vice president started the race as the clear frontrunner, leading the field by as much as\u00a032 percentage points\u00a0at one point, his campaign has steadily declined in recent months. Biden\u2019s decreasing political fortunes have comes as Warren\u2019s have\u00a0only increased. The Massachusetts Democrat has leapfrogged Biden in the early primary and caucus states. One recent poll out of Iowa showed Warren leading the field with 28 percent support among Democrats, while Biden was\u00a0relegated\u00a0to fourth place\u00a0with only 12 percent. A similar situation has played out nationally, by which most polls show Warren leading Biden, albeit with a narrow margin. As the candidates standing in the 2020 field has reversed, with Warren being described as the frontrunner by even some of Biden\u2019s former Obama administration colleagues, the former vice president has only escalated his criticism, as exhibited at the CNN town hall on Monday. \u201cI\u2019m more of a Democrat from my shoe sole to my ears than about anybody running in this party,\u201d Biden claimed, before clarifying that also included Warren.",

The beef between the two escalated after Warren unveiled her $52 trillion Medicare for All plan \u2014 a plan which she claims will not require a middle class tax hike. Biden\u2019s Deputy Campaign Manager Kate Bedingfield remarked on the \u201cmathematical gymnastics\u201d used in Warren\u2019s proposal, and the Massachusetts senator suggested that Biden was guilty of using \u201cRepublican talking points.\u201d \u201cDemocrats are not going to win by repeating Republican talking points and by dusting off the points of view of the giant insurance companies and the giant drug companies who don\u2019t want to see any change in the law that will bite into their profits,\u201d she said. Biden\u00a0defended\u00a0his position in a Medium post last week, noting that Warren\u2019s attack reflects \u201can angry unyielding viewpoint that has crept into our politics,\u201d although he did not mention her by name. \u201cThe other day I was accused by one of my opponents of running in the wrong primary. Pretty amazing. On one level, it is kind of funny,\u201d he wrote. He continued: But at another level these kinds of attacks are a serious problem. They reflect an angry unyielding viewpoint that has crept into our politics. If someone doesn\u2019t agree with you \u2014 it\u2019s not just that you disagree \u2014 that person must be a coward or corrupt or a small thinker.

It makes us unattractive to powerful men who want us to be quiet,\u201d it continued.

      "author": "Edwin Mora",
      "content": " The GoFundMe page in question has raised over $227,000 so far.\u00a0In collaboration with impeachment whistleblower lawyers from the Compass Rose Legal Group, Whistleblower Aid helped start the GoFundMe page in question back in September. Filed on November 8, the complaint alleges that the leaker that sparked the impeachment probe is capitalizing on his position within the intelligence community to generate funds in violation of the law. \u201cA U.S. intelligence officer who filed an urgent report of government misconduct needs your help.\u00a0This brave individual took an oath to protect and defend our Constitution.\u00a0We\u2019re working with the whistleblower and launched a crowdfunding effort to support the whistleblower\u2019s lawyers,\u201d the GoFundMe page proclaims. The complaint claimed that donations from an estimated 6,100 individuals \u201cclearly constitute\u201d gifts to the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d that may be restricted because of the leaker\u2019s official position within the intelligence community pursuant to\u00a05 CFR 2635.203\u00a0and other statutes. On Tuesday, Fox News, which obtained the complaint,\u00a0revealed,\u00a0\u201cThe complaint also raised the possibility that some of the donations may have come from prohibited sources, and asked the ICIG to look into whether any \u2018foreign citizen or agent of a foreign government\u2019 contributed.\u201d Moreover, the complaint alleges that the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d and his lawyers, who helped create the GoFundMe page, appear to be exploiting their access to classified information. In the November 8 complaint letter to ICIG Michael Atkinson, the same watchdog who received the impeachment probe leaker\u2019s complaint, Anthony Gallo from Tully Rinckey PLLC, the law firm representing the new whistleblower, notes: [M]y client believes \u2026 that the federal employee you are protecting and their attorneys apparently have strategically weaponized their alleged whistleblowing activities into a very lucrative money-making enterprise using a charity incorporated under a different name than the trade name it is using for fund-raising purposes, which would appear to my client to be a clear abuse of the federal employee\u2019s authority and access to classified information. When alluding to a \u201ccharity,\u201d Gallo was referencing the nonprofit Whistleblower Aid, also\u00a0known as Values United, an organization co-founded by one of the activist attorneys \u2014 Mark Zaid\u00a0\u2014 representing the leaker that triggered the impeachment probe. Tax documents from Values United reportedly show that the organization paid over $250,000 for advertising and consulting services alone. Gallo concluded in the complaint: We are requesting you investigate whether [criminal statutes or regulations have] been violated by the federal employee you are protecting when they reportedly requested an investigation into a matter that they had no direct personal knowledge of, and on account of which they were able to obtain sizable gifts from unknown persons because of their official duty. Tully Rinckey PLLC is refusing to reveal the identity of their client. Fox News, however, learned that the new whistleblower \u201cis the holder of a top-secret SCI security clearance and has served in government.\u201d \u201cI have not seen anything on this scale,\u201d Gallo told Fox News, referring to the more than a quarter-million dollars raised so far. \u201cIt\u2019s not about politics for my client\u2014 it\u2019s whistleblower-on-whistleblower, and [my client\u2019s] only interest is to see the government ethics rules are being complied with government-wide.\u201d News reports have described the intelligence community \u201cwhistleblower\u201d at the heart of the impeachment inquiry and his lawyers as anti-Trump partisans. Although the GoFundMe page alleges that \u201cdonations will only be accepted from U.S. citizens,\u201d most of the donors are not named.

      "author": "Edwin Mora",
      "content": " Croft, a State Department specialist on Ukraine, testified behind closed doors on October 30. House investigators asked her how she came to learn that Hunter was serving on Burisma\u2019s board of directors. \u201cI think it just came up, yeah, in conversation somebody was sort of annoyed that that was the case, but I can\u2019t remember specifically who said it, or under what circumstance,\u201d Croft, who appeared under subpoena, responded. She went on to describe why the unnamed official, presumably from the State Department, was annoyed, saying it stemmed from \u201cjust sort of a general concern about the appearance of the vice president\u2019s son doing business in Ukraine.\u201d Croft said that then-Vice President Joe Biden was heavily involved in Ukraine at the time that the official sounded the alarm on Hunter\u2019s position at Burisma. \u201cThe vice president was very engaged in Ukraine policy,\u201d she declared. Hunter served on\u00a0Burisma\u2019s\u00a0board of directors from 2014 until April of this year. As vice president, Biden was in charge of U.S. policy towards Ukraine while his son was working for Burisma, prompting allegations of corruption. The Bidens deny any wrongdoing. Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), the leader of the impeachment inquiry, rejected Republicans\u2019 request for Hunter and the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d to testify. Croft testified for about five hours. In what appears to be a few hours after she told House lawmakers pursuing the impeachment inquiry that at least one person raised concerns about Hunter\u2019s work in Ukraine, she appeared to walk back her remarks. House investigators asked Croft, \u201cDo you have any recollection of whether there was a concern that given Hunter Biden\u2019s role with the Burisma company and the Vice President\u2019s engagement that there was a potential conflict of interest?\u201d \u201cNo, not that I was aware of,\u201d Croft declared under oath after telling investigators at least one official had raised concerns about Hunter\u2019s work with Burisma. Croft\u2019s testimony echoed the deposition given by top State Department official George Kent, who indicated behind closed doors on October 15 that the Obama administration allowed Hunter to continue working for Burisma, even after learning that the firm and its owner, Mykola Zlochevsky, were corrupt. Kent testified that the Obama administration ignored him when he raised concerns in 2015 that Hunter\u2019s work in Ukraine created \u201cthe perception of a conflict of interest.\u201d Croft told House impeachment investigators that the media narrative behind Hunter\u2019s dealings in Ukraine and President Donald Trump\u2019s private lawyer Rudy Giuliani\u2019s efforts to push the Eastern European country to investigate the former vice president\u2019s son \u201cmade me centainly a lot more trepidatious\u201d about taking her current role at the State Department. She made those comments before denying that there were concerns about a potential conflict of interest stemming from Hunter serving on Burisma\u2019s board of directors. When asked why she was apprehensive about taking the position at the State Department, Croft indicated that corruption might be behind Hunter getting a job at Burisma, noting: I knew from my experience on the Ukraine desk and from working at the NSC [National Security Council] that, like I said before, the nature of the corruption in Ukraine makes it a particularly difficult country to work on, because it is difficult to know at any given time what interests are behind what actions. But one of the reasons that I ultimately agreed to take the job was because I felt I was probably better positioned than most to help and advise the [State] Department to manage those tricky waters. Before working at the State Department assisting former Special Envoy for Ukraine Kurt Volker, Croft previously worked on Ukraine issues for the NSC at the White House. Despite having no background in energy, Hunter served on the board of Burisma for up to $83,000 per month, prompting allegations of corruption. He admitted\u00a0to ABC News that his father\u2019s political position helped him secure the lucrative appointment to Burisma\u2019s board of directors. House Democrats conducting the impeachment probe have accused Trump of pressuring Ukraine to investigate corruption allegations against the Bidens in exchange for aid, as part of an alleged quid pro quo. Trump, Ukraine, and some impeachment inquiry witnesses have denied the allegation gleaned from a \u201cwhistleblower\u201d complaint that triggered the probe. White House hopeful Joe Biden gloated about pushing Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor who had been investigating Burisma by withholding aid to the Eastern European country. Some impeachment probe witnesses have presumed that a quid pro quo did take place, citing second-hand information. There are signs Democrats are trying to move the impeachment investigation beyond Ukraine.",

According to the memo, the Intelligence panel leading the probe will not \u201cfacilitate any efforts by President Trump or his allies to threaten, intimidate, or retaliate against the whistleblower who courageously and lawfully raised concerns about the President\u2019s conduct.\u201d Under a section dubbed, \u201cWhistleblower Protection and Confidentiality,\u201d the memo stressed, The Committee has a long, proud, and bipartisan history of protecting whistleblowers\u2014including from efforts to threaten, intimidate, retaliate against or undermine the confidentiality of whistleblowers. \u00a0\u2026\u00a0The Code of Official Conduct for Members of Congress requires that every Member \u201cshall behave at all times in a manner that shall reflect creditably on the House.\u201d The Committee on Ethics has historically viewed this provision as \u201cencompassing violations of law and abuses of one\u2019s official position.\u201d Even left-wing mainstream media outlets, including CNN, the New York Times, and Reuters \u2014 have acknowledged that everyone but the intelligence community inspector general who took the complaint is allowed under current law to identify the \u201cwhistleblower.\u201d Schiff, however, is preventing members of the committees pursuing the impeachment inquiry from even mentioning the leaker, let alone identifying the \u201cwhistleblower.\u201d Last week, a different whistleblower filed a complaint with the ICIG accusing the Democrat\u2019s so-called courageous leaker of possibly breaking the law.\u00a0The impeachment leaker \u201cweaponized\u201d whistleblowing into a \u201cvery lucrative money-making enterprise,\u201d the complaint alleges. Schiff has rejected the Republican\u2019s request for the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d and former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter to testify. In his complaint, the Democrats\u2019 \u201cwhistleblower\u201d accused Trump of pressuring Ukraine during a July 25 call to investigate corruption allegations against Joe and Hunter in exchange for aid. Trump, Ukraine, and some impeachment probe witnesses have denied the allegations. Meanwhile, however, other witnesses have presumed that a quid pro quo did take place in which the U.S. President pressured Ukraine in exchange for aid. The partisan impeachment inquiry resolution, approved almost entirely along partisan lines with two Democrats joining all Republicans in opposing it, authorized public hearings, which are expected to begin Wednesday.",

      "content": " Buttigieg has been slowly working his way up in national and early-state polls in recent weeks. He made waves last month after jumping to third place in Iowa, as a Suffolk University/USA Today poll showed. The Monmouth University poll, taken\u00a0November 7 to 11, 2019, among 451 likely Democrat caucus-goers in Iowa, found Buttigieg leading the pack with 22 percent support. The former vice president came in second place with 19 percent support, causing Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) to drop to third and fourth place with 18 percent and 13 percent, respectively. While Warren\u2019s drop to third may seem significant, it is only a two percent drop from the 20 percent support she saw in Monmouth\u2019s previous poll. No other candidate came close to the top four. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) garnered five percent support, followed by Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), Tom Steyer (D), and Andrew Yang (D), all of whom saw three percent support each. The remaining candidates saw two percent support or less. The margin of error is +/- 4.6 percent, signaling a tight race among the top three \u2014 Buttigieg, Biden, and Warren:  According to Monmouth, Buttigieg \u201chas gained ground among every major demographic group since the summer.\u201d Per Monmouth: His support stands at 26% among voters who describe themselves as moderate or conservative, 23% among those who are somewhat liberal, and 15% among those who are very liberal. He is currently in the top tier for both women (24%, to 22% for Biden, and 20% for Warren), and men (20%, to 19% for Sanders and 16% for Warren).\u00a0 Looking at the poll results by age, Buttigieg (26%) is nipping at Biden\u2019s heels (29%) among voters age 65 and older. He has a slight advantage among those age 50 to 64 (24%, to 17% each for Biden and Warren), and is competitive among voters under the age of 50 (19%, to 24% for Warren and 19% for Sanders).\u00a0 Buttigieg leads among college graduates (24%, to 21% for Warren and 15% for Biden) and is in the top tier among those without a college degree (21%, to 21% for Biden, 18% for Sanders, and 16% for Warren). \u201cButtigieg is emerging as a top pick for a wide variety of Iowa Democrats,\u201d\u00a0Monmouth University Polling Institute Director Patrick Murray\u00a0said, noting that the presidential hopeful\u2019s support cannot be attributed to any one group. \u201cWhile he has made nominally bigger gains among older caucusgoers, you really can\u2019t pigeonhole his support to one particular group,\u201d he continued. \u201cHe is doing well with voters regardless of education or ideology.\u201d Additionally, Buttigieg is enjoying the highest favorability in the crowded field, with a 73 percent favorability rating from likely Democrat caucus-goers. Warren follows with 69 percent, followed by Biden with 65 percent and Sanders with 61 percent.",

      "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
      "content": " Kent already testified once, on October 15 \u2014 behind closed doors and long before an \u201cimpeachment inquiry\u201d was authorized. The transcript was only recently released. Democrats are making Kent one of their two leadoff witnesses because for two reasons. First, he comes across as a likable curmudgeon: while he has sharp criticism for President Donald Trump, he also has a quick wit. Second, he has many negative things to say about the role of former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani, acting as President Trump\u2019s personal lawyer and also as a player in U.S.-Ukrainian relations. Democrats will use Kent\u2019s testimony to lay the foundation for an attack on Giuliani that they hope will paint the president in the worst possible light as well. (Giuliani also published an op-ed on Tuesday evening in the\u00a0Wall Street\u00a0Journal, which will appear in print on Wednesday: \u00a0\u201cMy client\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president was innocent, and the House inquiry is a travesty.\u201d) Key Democratic Talking Points 1. Kent will testify that he believes that Giuliani, through dubious sources in Ukraine, was part of a \u201ccampaign of slander\u201d that led to President firing Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch. One of the key articles in the campaign was published by John Solomon in\u00a0The Hill, in which former\u00a0Ukrainian Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko claimed that Yovanovitch had given him a \u201cdo not prosecute\u201d list. She was alleged to be anti-Trump. She denies all of the claims. 2. In their summary of Kent\u2019s testimony, Democrats claim: \u201cWith respect to President Trump\u2019s request that Ukraine investigate former Vice President Biden, Mr. Kent stated: \u2018I do not believe the U.S. should ask other countries to engage in politically associated investigations and prosecutions.'\u201d He also said that Trump\u2019s actions were wrong. 3. Kent told the closed-door hearing that he had heard from Ambassador to the E.U. Gordon Sondland that \u201cPOTUS wanted nothing less than President Zelensky to go to microphone and say investigations, Biden, and Clinton.\u201d Another key point: Kent testified the U.S. has made aid to Ukraine conditional on reform in the past. For example, the U.S. made\u00a0sovereign loan\u00a0guarantees from 2014-2016 conditional on reform in the Ukrainian prosecution services. Asked whether he thought former Vice President Biden had used a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d in his now-infamous threat to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid unless Ukraine fired its chief prosecutor, Kent said he preferred the term \u201cconditionality for assistance,\u201d saying that governments use it, as well as the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

      "subtitle": "WASHINGTON, DC \u2014 Top State Department official George Kent told the House impeachment investigators Wednesday that some U.S. officials, including himself, pushed for reopening a \u201cscuttled investigation\u201d into the owner of Ukrainian company Burisma Holdings, which hired then-Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter in 2014.",
      "author": "Edwin Mora",
      "content": " That means Kent did what the Democrats are trying to impeach U.S. President Donald Trump over \u2014\u00a0urging Ukraine to investigate corruption allegations against the former vice president and his son, who worked for Burisma from 2014\u00a0until April of this year.  The testimony from Kent, a deputy assistant secretary of state charged with overseeing U.S. policy towards Ukraine, came during the first public impeachment inquiry hearing Wednesday. In his closed-door deposition on October 15, Kent indicated that the Obama administration allowed Hunter to continue working with Burisma even after learning that Ukraine, in collaboration with the U.S., were investigating corruption accusations against the firm and its owner, Mykola Zlochevsky. American officials wanted to hold responsible corrupt Ukrainian prosecutors who allegedly took bribes to bury the investigation into Burisma owner Zlochevsky, Kent testified Wednesday, adding: I did not witness any effort by any U.S. official to shield Burisma from scrutiny. In fact, I and other U.S. officials consistently advocated reinstitution a scuttled investigation of Zlochevsky, Burisma\u2019s founder, as well as holding the corrupt prosecutors who hold the closed the case to account. .. In early 2015, I raised questions with the deputy prosecutor general about why the investigation of Mr. Zlochevsky had been terminated based on our belief that prosecutors had accepted bribes to close the case. After, I became aware that Hunter Biden was on the board of Burisma. Soon after that in a briefing call with the national security staff of the office of the Vice President in February 2015, I raised my concern that Hunter Biden\u2019s status as a board member could create the perception of a conflict of interest. The Obama administration ignored Kent\u2019s concerns about Hunter\u2019s work in Ukraine. In 2014, the U.S. spent nearly half a million dollars in American taxpayer funds in support of an investigation into corrupt activities linked to Burisma owner Zlochevsky, Kent testified behind closed doors on October 15. \u201cThe pervasive and long-standing problem of corruption in Ukraine included exposure to a situation involving the energy company Burisma. The primary concern with the U.S. governments since 2014 was Burisma\u2019s owner, Mykola Zlochevsky, whose frozen assets abroad we had attempted to recover on Ukraine\u2019s behalf,\u201d Kent told lawmakers Wednesday. Kent went on to highlight the possibility of \u201ccriminal nexuses\u201d between activities in Ukraine and the United States. \u201cU.S. law enforcement should pursue the case. If we think there has been a criminal act overseas that violates U.S. law, we have the institutional mechanisms to address that,\u201d he added. \u201cIt could be through the Justice Department and FBI agents assigned overseas or through treated mechanisms such as the mutual legal assistance treaty.\u201d While his father was in charge of U.S. policy towards Ukraine, Hunter began serving on\u00a0Burisma\u2019s\u00a0board of directors in 2014. At the crux of the impeachment probe is an allegedly anti-Trump \u201cwhistleblower\u2019s\u201d complaint accusing the U.S. president of engaging in a quid pro quo in which he leveraged U.S. aid to Ukraine to pressure the country to investigate corruption allegations against the Bidens. Trump and Ukraine deny the claim. Echoing Kent, State Department specialist on Ukraine Catherine Croft told House impeachment investigators when she testified on October 30 that at least one unnamed official was \u201cannoyed\u201d and concerned about Hunter\u2019s position at Ukraine. The unnamed official\u2019s concerns stemmed from \u201cjust sort of a general concern about the appearance of the vice president\u2019s son doing business in Ukraine,\u201d Croft testified. Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), the lead impeachment inquisitor, has denied the Republican\u2019s request for testimony from Hunter and the \u201cwhistleblower,\u201d whose complaint triggered the probe to testify despite\u00a0the leaker and Hunter being at the center of the impeachment probe. Ukraine quashed the corruption investigation into Burisma before investigators reached any conclusions. The Bidens, nevertheless, have denied any wrongdoing. House Democrats\u2019 pursuing the partisan impeachment probe are trying to determine if Trump abused his power by urging Ukraine to investigate corruption allegations against Bidens in exchange for aid. Some impeachment probe witnesses have indicated that there is merit to claims of corruption potentially linked to Hunter Biden\u2019s interactions Ukraine. Schiff, however, is blocking Hunter from testifying, irking GOP lawmakers. In early October, Ukraine announced plans to review a probe into Burisma. \u201cProsecutor General Russian Ryaboshapka said his office will revisit 15 investigations, including ones involving the company, Burisma, and the owner of the company, former Ecology Minister Mykola Zlochevsky,\u201d United Press International noted. The House Intelligence Committee is leading the impeachment probe, collaborating with the panels on oversight and reform and intelligence.",

      "author": "Haris Alic",
      "content": " Testifying before the House Intelligence Committee on the opening day of the inquiry, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent admitted that U.S. officials had been urging the Ukrainian government for some time to explain why an investigation into Burisma Holdings, the eastern European oil and gas company that employed Hunter Biden on its board of directors, was shut down. \u201cWe\u2019ve continued to press Ukrainian officials to answer for why allege corrupt prosecutors had closed [the] case,\u201d Kent said. \u201cWe have until now got an unsatisfactory answer.\u201d Kent, who has claimed former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani engineered the firing of the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine through a \u201ccampaign of slander,\u201d is considered a key witness for congressional Democrats as they seek to prove the president\u2019s conduct rises to the level of impeachment. On Wednesday, however, Kent inadvertently strengthened the argument that Republicans and the president, himself, have made that Hunter Biden\u2019s conduct in Ukraine should be probed given his father\u2019s role overseeing policy in the region and the allegations of corruption lodged against Burisma and its founder, Mykola Zlochevsky. It was on the latter front that Kent\u2019s testimony proved particularly revealing. The state department official admitted he and his colleagues believed\u00a0Zlochevsky \u201chad stolen money\u201d and the Ukrainian prosecutor charged with investigating him shut down the case after taking a bribe. When asked if he was in favor of the Ukrainian government reopening the probe into Bruisma and Zlochevsky, Kent asserted he would \u201clove\u201d to see such an action so it could become clear who was bribed and to what extent. Kent also asserted that Burisma had a \u201cmixed business reputation\u201d and Hunter Biden\u2019s decision to join its board of directors had led him to raise concerns with former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s office in 2015. \u201cIn a briefing call with\u2026the office of the Vice President\u2026I raised my concern that Hunter Biden\u2019s status as a [Burisma] board member could create the perception of a conflict of interest,\u201d Kent testified. At the center of controversy is how and why Hunter Biden secured the appointment, which at times paid more than $83,000 a month. As Peter Schweizer, senior contributor at Breitbart News, detailed in his\u00a0book,\u00a0Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends, Hunter Biden had no prior experience with either the energy industry or Ukraine before joining Burisma in April 2014. Adding to concerns is the fact that at the time Hunter Biden joined Burisma, the company was seen as actively courting western leaders to prevent further scrutiny of its business practices. The same month Hunter Biden was tapped for the group\u2019s board, the government of Great Britain\u00a0froze\u00a0accounts belonging to Zlochevsky under suspicion of money laundering. Zlochevsky, a former Ukrainian minister of natural resources, would later be accused of\u00a0corruption\u00a0for using his office to approve oil and gas licenses to companies under his control. A Ukrainian official with strong ties to Zlochevsky admitted in October the only reason that Hunter Biden secured the appointment was to \u201cprotect\u201d the company from foreign scrutiny.",

      "author": "Edwin Mora",
      "content": " Rep. John Ratcliffe (R-TX) asked the witnesses whether the Ukrainians were aware of the security assistance freeze at the time of the July 25 call between President Donald Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky, a conversation that spawned the impeachment probe. \u201cNot to my knowledge,\u201d responded both witnesses \u2014 U.S. Acting Ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor and George Kent, a deputy assistant secretary of state charged with overseeing the U.S. policy towards the Eastern European country. Their denial suggests Trump could not have pressured Ukraine to investigate anyone by threatening to withhold an unknown during the July 25 call, the contents of which were the bulk of a complaint filed by a \u201cwhistleblower\u201d that ultimately triggered the impeachment inquiry. Ratcliffe has participated in the public and closed-door impeachment inquiry hearings. \u201cJuly 25 is a week after the hold was put on the security assistance. And [on] July 25, they had a conversation between the two presidents, where it was not discussed,\u201d Taylor told Ratcliffe during his closed-door deposition on October 22. Ukraine did not find out there was a hold on U.S. aid until\u00a0over\u00a0a month after the call by way of an August 28 Politico article, Taylor testified, echoing other witnesses. Other impeachment witnesses, however \u2013 namely Catherine Croft from State and Laura Cooper, a Ukraine expert at the Pentagon \u2013\u00a0told House impeachment investigators during their deposition last month that Ukrainians knew of the hold before the information became public. The Washington Post, which reported on the Cooper and Croft revelation, did not provide a specific date for when Ukrainians allegedly found out. At the heart of the impeachment probe is the \u201cwhistleblower\u2019 complaint accusing Trump of engaging in a quid pro quo in which the U.S. leader pressured Zelensky during the July 25 call to investigate his political rival Joe Biden and son Hunter in exchange for aid. House Democrats are trying to determine if Trump abused his power by making a quid pro quo offer to Ukraine to launch a corruption probe against the Bidens in return for security assistance. Ratcliffe and other Republicans argue that a quid pro quo would be impossible during the call without Ukraine knowing that the United States had frozen aid. \u201cYou can\u2019t have a quid pro quo without no quo,\u201d Trump cited Ratcliffe as saying afterward.  The U.S. ended up releasing the aid to Ukraine on September 11 without the Eastern European country doing anything in return. There are signs that Democrats are trying to expand the impeachment probe beyond the Ukraine-linked quid pro quo, which they and their backers now admit has evolved possibly into bribery and extortion. It appears Democrats are engaged in a fishing expedition to remove Trump at any cost, with the ultimate aim of overturning the 2016 elections about a year before U.S. voters go to the polls again. In an ironic twist, the Democrats\u2019 impeachment probe to find out if Trump attempted to interfere in the 2020 presidential race is already interfering in the presidential elections.",

      "content": " Graham added that he would not allow a trial of President Donald Trump in the Senate based on hearsay evidence alone, and without testimony from the \u201cwhistleblower.\u201d Graham was speaking after the close of the first day of public hearings in the House Intelligence Committee as part of the \u201cimpeachment inquiry\u201d authorized by Democrats in a House resolution that passed on party lines October 31. After the first two witnesses testified, Democrats on the committee voted along party lines to table a motion made by Republicans to call the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d \u2014 who admitted having no first-hand knowledge \u2014 to testify in person. Republicans \u2014 notably Rep. Mike Turner (R-OH) \u2014 pointed out that neither of the two witnesses would qualify to testify in court, since they only had \u201chearsay\u201d evidence, i.e. they did not see or hear anything relevant themselves. The Sixth Amendment, which guarantees the right to confront one\u2019s accuser, excludes hearsay evidence in most circumstances \u2014 especially when the direct evidence, in this case the transcript of the telephone call between the president and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. Graham, as chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and a former impeachment manager during the trial of former President Bill Clinton, would have considerable sway over the procedural rules the Senate would adopt for Trump\u2019s trial if the House impeaches the president. He declared that he would bar any case against the president based on hearsay alone, suggesting the prospects of a motion to dismiss. \u201cAny resolution setting up a trial in the Senate \u2014 I\u2019m going to make sure that hearsay cannot be the basis of an impeachment investigation,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you excluded hearsay, like every other court in the land, there\u2019s nothing there,\u201d he added. \u201cIf you invoked the hearsay rule, what would be left?\u201d He described impeachment based on hearsay as \u201ca threat to the presidency itself.\u201d Graham added that he would require that the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d testify. \u201cAny trial in the Senate must expose the whistleblower so the president can confront his accuser. I will not accept a trial in the Senate until I know who the whistleblower is,\u201d he said. Graham also said that Congress needed to satisfy questions about the whistleblower\u2019s potential motivations \u2014 and whether he had a role in former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s conflict of interest regarding his son Hunter\u2019s board position in a corrupt Ukrainian company, Burisma. Biden threatened to block $1 billion of U.S. aid unless Ukraine fired a prosecutor who was, theoretically at least, overseeing an investigation of the company\u2019s corruption. Some media reports have suggested that the whistleblower worked for Biden under the Obama administration. \u201cWas the whistleblower connected to Joe Biden in any way? \u2026\u00a0Here\u2019s the point: did the whistleblower engage in an effort to get the Ukrainian president [at the time, Petro] Poroshenko, to weigh in and stop the investigation of this gas company [Burisma]? Was there a connection between the whistleblower and Biden\u2019s effort to call the Ukraine? Graham also vowed that House Intelligence Committee chair Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) would be called to testify. Ordinarily, he said, he would not call a member of the House to testify, as a matter of mere oversight, but an impeachment trial was a special case. \u201cOne of the witnesses will be Adam Schiff because if he, in fact, did meet with the whistleblower, and coached the guy up, I think that\u2019s relevant to the impeachment inquiry itself,\u201d Graham said. Schiff denied having met the whistleblower, and denied knowing the whistleblower\u2019s identity, in the hearing on Wednesday \u2014 but he was not under oath. Joel B.

      "content": " The former vice president, who has seen his fundraising numbers shrink and his\u00a0position in the polls falter since the start of the inquiry, went on the offense Tuesday with a series of actions designed to showcase his foreign policy background. Most notably, Biden\u2019s campaign announced the launch of a new television ad in Iowa highlighting the candidate\u2019s tenure on the world stage over the past 40 years. The ad, which is entitled \u201cMoment,\u201d attempts to portray Biden as the only political figure able lead during this \u201cdangerous\u201d period in which \u201cdictators and tyrants are praised,\u201d while \u201cour allies [are] pushed aside.\u201d The ad states over photos of global crises intermixed with images of the former vice president over the span of tenure in the Obama administration: This is a moment that requires strong, steady, stable leadership. We need someone tested, and trusted around the world. This is a moment for Joe Biden, a president with the experience to lead on day one.  The 30-second ad, which started airing across Iowa\u2019s broadcast markets on Tuesday, is part of a previously announced $4 million media buy in the state. To accompany its launch, the campaign also released a list of endorsements from more than 130 former foreign policy and national security officials. Listed among the endorsers are a bevy of career bureaucrats\u00a0from the administration\u2019s of former Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama. Many of those backing Biden had signed letters in 2016 warning that Trump\u2019s election would be a disaster for America\u2019s national security. The former vice president\u2019s campaign stated when announcing the endorsements on Tuesday: The size and breadth of today\u2019s cohort of endorsers highlight both the extreme threat that Donald Trump poses to our nation and our world, and the widespread belief among those who\u2019ve devoted their lives to keeping America safe that Biden is the candidate best prepared to step in as commander in chief. It is unclear, though, if either the ad or the newfound support will be enough to reverse the damage done to Biden\u2019s campaign. From the moment it became public that Trump\u00a0suggested\u00a0the Ukrainian government probe Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings in the country, the former vice president has struggled to explain the appearance of conflicts of interest. At the center of the controversy is how the younger\u00a0Biden secured an appointment to the\u00a0board of directors of Burisma Holdings, a Ukranian oil and gas conglomerate. As Peter Schweizer, senior contributor at Breitbart News,\u00a0detailed\u00a0in his book\u00a0Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends, Hunter Biden secured the position, which\u00a0paid\u00a0as much as\u00a0$83,000 per month, despite having no background in energy or Ukraine. Adding to the appearance of impropriety is the fact that\u00a0Hunter Biden joined Burisma at a time the company was seen as actively courting western leaders to prevent further scrutiny of its business practices. The same month the younger Biden\u2019s appointment was announced,\u00a0the government of Great Britain\u00a0froze\u00a0accounts belonging to Burisma founder Mykola Zlochevsky under suspicion of money laundering. Zlochevsky, a former Ukrainian minister of natural resources, would later be accused of\u00a0corruption\u00a0for using his office to approve oil and gas licenses to Burisma. Not only had Zlochevsky had his assets frozen in Great Britain, but the former Ukrainian minister of natural resources was also facing suspicions of public corruption at home. Zlochevsky would later be\u00a0charged\u00a0with corruption for using his ministerial office to approve oil and gas licenses to companies under his control. A Ukrainian official with strong ties to Zlochevsky admitted in October the only reason that Hunter Biden secured the appointment was to \u201cprotect\u201d the company from foreign scrutiny. The claim has credence given that at the time Joe Biden, as the sitting vice president, was tasked with leading the Obama administration\u2019s policy towards Ukraine in response to Russia\u2019s invasion of Crimea. It is in the context of Burisma and Zlochevsky\u2019s legal troubles that Joe Biden\u2019s political influence has raised the most red flags. The former vice president has particularly drawn questions over his conduct in demanding the Ukrainian government fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, in 2016. Joe Biden, who has publicly\u00a0bragged\u00a0about the firing, reportedly threatened to withhold more than one billion\u00a0dollars in U.S. aid if the Ukrainian government did not remove Shokin. He has claimed the demand came from then-President Barack Obama, who had allegedly lost faith in the prosecutor\u2019s ability to tackle corruption. Unofficially, though, it was known that Shokin was investigating both Burisma and Zlochevsky for public corruption. It is uncertain if the probe extended to Hunter Biden, although Shokin has recently admitted that prior to his ouster he was\u00a0warned\u00a0to back off the matter. Regardless of what occurred, Shokin\u2019s successor, who is now himself being\u00a0investigated\u00a0for public corruption,\u00a0dropped the investigation into Burisma and Zlochevsky. The shadowy history, accompanied by revelations that Burisma sought to leverage its ties to Hunter Biden for access to the Obama-era State Department, has impacted the former vice president\u2019s credibility on the world stage. In the case of most candidates, that would not matter much, as a majority of those running for the Democrat nomination have barely any foreign policy experience. For Biden, however, his time on the international stage is a central selling point of his campaign. Biden, who once chaired the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has trumpeted himself as the only candidate ready to manage national security and geopolitics on his first day in office. In countless Democrat presidential primary debates, the former vice president has used his foreign policy experience to one-up his Democrat rivals. Biden was also the first 2020 Democrat to elaborate on how his global vision differs from\u00a0 Trump\u2019s \u2018America First\u2019 agenda. The former vice president said in July during a widely publicized foreign policy address: The challenge of following this disastrous presidency will not be just to restore the reputation of our credibility. It will be to enact a forward-looking foreign policy for the world as we find it today and as we anticipate it will be tomorrow and years to come. All of that, however, has evaporated in the face of the impeachment inquiry and the spotlight on his son\u2019s foreign ties, forcing the former vice president to try to salvage his image through measures like those witnessed on Tuesday.",

Taylor\u2019s information came from one of Taylor\u2019s staffers who claimed he overheard the president\u2019s phone call with Sondland. The New Jersey Democrat chastised Taylor over his assertion. \u201cIt\u2019s hearsay,\u201d Van Drew said after Wednesday\u2019s impeachment inquiry hearing. \u201cIt\u2019s really difficult dealing with this because it\u2019s he said-she said.\u201d Reps. Van Drew and Collin Peterson (D-MN) were the two House Democrats to vote against House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s (D-CA) resolution formalizing the rules and proceedings regarding their impeachment inquiry. Van Drew said he would need to see the stronger evidence such as verifiable documents or audio of President Trump\u2019s conversations to prove the allegations levied against him for him to back impeachment. \u201cFrankly the aid did flow, so that really isn\u2019t an issue at the end of the day,\u201d Van Drew added. \u201cThe aid flowed, and everything resolved.\u201d Van Drew\u2019s district represents one of the many districts that Democrats flipped during the 2018 midterm elections. President Trump and Republicans hope to flip red during the 2020 congressional elections. President Trump defeated Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential election in New Jersey\u2019s second congressional district. Other Democrats have continued to criticize the impeachment inquiry into President Trump as \u201chopelessly partisan.\u201d Rep. Collin Peterson (D-MN) said in October his constituents said this move to impeach the president has fractured the nation. \u201cI have been hearing from my constituents on both sides of this matter for months, and the escalation of calls this past week just shows me how divided our country really is right now,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout support from Senate Republicans, going down this path is a mistake. Today\u2019s vote is both unnecessary, and widely misrepresented in the media and by Republicans as a vote on impeachment. I will not make a decision on impeachment until all the facts have been presented,\u201d Van Drew added. In contrast to Peterson, Rep. Jarden Golden (D-ME), another freshman Democrat, claimed recently Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry will not pull \u201cthe country apart.\u201d Sean Moran is a congressional reporter for Breitbart News.

      "author": "John Nolte",
      "content": " Never before in the history of the modern presidential campaign have we seen such a thing. The news\u00a0former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick\u00a0has decided to pull the trigger on a late presidential run is nowhere near as interesting or consequential as the why behind his decision. At this point, there are really only two people who could scramble the board: Oprah Winfrey and Michelle Obama. Patrick is waaaay behind in the crucial areas of fundraising and field organization, and has no national name recognition. Nevertheless, Patrick, a popular two-term governor, has some things going for him. At 63, he\u2019s younger than 77-year-old Biden (But who isn\u2019t? \u2014 oh, yeah, Bernie Sanders.), he\u2019s not disintegrating mentally and physically like Biden, he\u2019s not a demented socialist like Bernie and Elizabeth Warren, he\u2019s older than 37-year-old Pete Buttigieg, and as a black man he can win those votes in South Carolina. In other words, had he launched his campaign months ago, he might very well be the frontrunner today. Granted, there are also some benefits to jumping in late. He\u2019s a clean slate without any gaffes, and he knows what the competition is up to. The deficits, however, are huge. On top of money and organizational issues, after leaving the governor\u2019s office in 2015, he went to work for *shuts off lights, places flashlight under chin* BBBBAAAAAIN CAAAAAAPITAL. You remember Bain Capital, the organization evil corporate raider Mitt Romney worked for, the organization Obama used to beat Romney senseless with during their 2012 presidential match, the organization that gives women cancer? Yep, same Bain. In a party openly embracing socialism, a party that turned the words \u201cBain\u201d and \u201cCapital\u201d into the Boogeyman\u2026 Well, let\u2019s just say Warren and Sanders are going to have a field day. And if the unexpected happens and Patrick does win the nomination, Trump will have countless clips of Obama and other high profile Democrats (not to mention the media) declaring Bain a disqualifier for the presidency. Patrick\u2019s late entry is a Hail Mary, but a calculated one\u2026 The question is, why? Well, Patrick and Obama are close. In fact, Obama tried to talk Patrick into running last year, but was turned down. Patrick feared the ugliness of the race, his wife was ill, and he was probably thrilled to be making a pile of money giving women cancer. But Patrick is getting in now, isn\u2019t he? And it is more than fair to assume he\u2019s getting in because Obama begged him to. The reasons are obvious\u2026 As is being reported everywhere, the smoke-filled-room fellas, the leaders of the Democrat Party, the money men, the Obamas, etc., are terrified of Warren\u2019s socialistic tendencies, know Buttigieg is too young and too gay\u2026 But most of all they know Old Joe Biden just doesn\u2019t have the stuff. To be fair, Slow Joe never had the stuff. He\u2019s always been a terrible presidential candidate, and there are reports Obama tried to discourage him from running. And then there\u2019s Joe and his son Hunter looting China and Ukraine, the two countries Obama put Biden in charge of. Although Democrats and the media are frantically trying to cover for Biden with this stupid impeachment crusade, Trump\u2019s numbers haven\u2019t moved, while Quid Pro Joe\u2019s have sunk. Don\u2019t forget Joe\u2019s looting reflects on Obama, on his legacy, and if impeachment hits the Senate for a trial, Republicans are in charge over there, which means any trial that takes place will be a referendum on Joe and Hunter Biden just as Iowa and New Hampshire get ready to vote. Obama is looking at his legacy, he is looking at the quality of a hapless Democrat field, and he is so concerned he just stabbed Biden, his ever-loyal vice president, right in the back, and is doing so with the \u00a0biggest vote of \u201cno confidence\u201d a frontrunner ever received in modern presidential politics. Sure, Patrick may swipe some New Hampshire voters from Warren and Bernie, but that\u2019s unlikely. The Democrats who back Bernie and Warren are in love. No, Patrick\u2019s beliefs align more closely with Biden, and the threat he represents is aimed right at Biden\u2019s Achilles heel: the black vote that is just barely keeping Biden above water.

      "author": "John Nolte",
      "content": " Obviously, it was not supposed to be this way. Democrats and their establishment media allies were certain they had crafted a silver bullet that would accomplish two things at once: 1) doom President Trump\u2019s re-election chances, and 2) shield Old Joe from the fact he and his son are guilty of looting China and Ukraine. What a fail. As of this writing, Trump sits at a relatively healthy job approval rating of 44.1 percent per the RealClearPolitics poll of polls. That\u2019s only a single point lower than when the media and Democrats launched their Impeachment Hoax. What\u2019s more, in less than three weeks, Trump\u2019s job approval has climbed almost four points. Oh, and Slow Joe\u2026? The Impeachment Hoax has backfired spectacularly on Slow Joe. As the media and Democrats attempt to find an impeachable offense, as they hold secret hearings, as they move the goalposts from a quid pro quo that can\u2019t be proved (and would not be impeachable if it were) to the crime of \u2014 LOL \u2014 bribery, as Democrats and the media founder around stepping on rakes, the Impeachment Hoax Spotlight is instead exposing the Biden Family Crime Syndicate. Barack Obama put his vice president in charge of diplomatic relations with Ukraine and China, and Biden thanked him by sending his son Hunter in to loot both countries. Unlike Trump asking Ukraine to investigate corruption, and tying federal aid to that request (which is appropriate), Joe and Hunter Biden\u2019s brazen looting is a very simple crime for the American people to understand. Hunter has no experience in the energy field, does not speak the language in Ukraine, and still he was awarded a seat on the board of the energy company Burisma, a company owned by a crooked oligarch who did not want to be investigated for corruption. While Burisma was in the middle of paying Hunter millions, Joe Biden used the threat of U.S. aid to force Ukraine to fire a prosecutor looking into Burisma. See how easy it was to explain the Biden\u2019s jaw-dropping corruption? Watch me do it again\u2026 Hunter hitched a ride on Air Force Two while Slow Joe visited China on behalf of the United States, and guess who secured a $1.5 billion \u2014 with a \u201cB\u201d \u2014 deal for his company while he was in China? Guess who secured that deal with the Chinese government through a state-owned bank? And we are talking about a deal that could be worth tens of millions of dollars to the Biden family. With Biden\u2019s corruption so brazen and easy to explain, the Impeachment Hoax is not working as intended\u2026 Trump\u2019s doing fine\u2026 Joe\u2026? Not so much. Joe\u2019s national lead in the Democrat field is sinking. He was up double digits pre-Impeachment Hoax. Now he\u2019s down to a five point lead in the RCP poll of polls and Elizabeth Warren beats him by three in the most recent polling. In Iowa, Biden has slipped to third place behind Warren and Pete Buttigieg. Pre-Impeachment Hoax, Slow Joe earned 29 percent support, and a ten point lead over second place. Now he\u2019s dropped to just 17 points and is less than a point ahead of fourth place Bernie Sanders. That is what you call a collapse. In New Hampshire, Biden was edged out the pack with support in the low-20s pre-Impeachment Hoax. Now he\u2019s at 19.7 percent support, tied with Warren and hardly a point ahead of Bernie. Biden appears to be hanging on in Nevada and South Carolina, but there has not been much polling out of there of late. That could change quite dramatically, though, now that Obama has slapped Slow Joe with the most humiliating vote of \u201cno confidence\u201d in the history of the modern presidential campaign. With former Gov. Deval Patrick joining the race (undoubtedly at Obama\u2019s request), Biden now has some serious competition for the black vote that has so far kept him competitive. The Impeachment Hoax is backfiring, is taking down the very guy who had the best chance of beating Trump in 2020. Meanwhile, over in MAGA Land, on the horizon is Trump\u2019s eventual vindication celebration when the Impeachment Hoax comes to its ignoble end, a roaring economy, a loyal base of support that can\u2019t wait to vote for him, and a Democrat field filled with socialists, morons, Fake Indians, and looters.

      "author": "Robert Kraychik",
      "content": " \u201cImpeachment does not center on legal-illegal,\u201d Akerman said during cross-examination with Pollak, who made the case against Democratic lawmakers\u2019 ongoing impeachment inquiry targeting President Donald Trump. The \u201cGreat Impeachment Debate,\u201d streamed by Mediaite and carried by SiriusXM, was moderated by Dan Abrams, ABC\u2019s chief legal analyst and founder of Mediaite. Akerman and Pollak clashed over allegations that President Donald Trump had leveraged foreign aid to Ukraine to assist his presidential reelection campaign by pressuring the Ukrainian government to investigate possible corruption on the part of Joe Biden and Hunter Biden. Akerman, a\u00a0former SDNY Assistant U.S. Attorney, revealed a weak point in the Democrats\u2019 case when he admitted \u2014 as\u00a0he\u00a0was questioning Pollak \u2014 that\u00a0the argument has little to do with whether Trump has broken any federal laws. This exchange occurred during the debate\u2019s question-and-answer phase (beginning at 51:41). A partial transcript follows: AKERMAN: Okay, Joel. Is it your position that it is proper for a President of the United States to condition military aid to a foreign country on the receipt of assistance with his campaign for reelection? POLLAK: Objection, counsel. That assumes facts not in evidence. AKERMAN: I\u2019m not assuming anything,\u00a0I\u2019m just asking you that particular question. Assuming that the facts are as such \u2014 POLLAK: \u2014 A hypothetical example? Is it proper to condition foreign aid on \u2014 AKERMAN: \u2014 to condition military aid to a foreign country on the receipt of assistance with the president\u2019s campaign for reelection. POLLAK: Well, I reject the hypothetical. It\u2019s a prejudicial hypothetical, and it\u2019s not what we\u2019re looking at, here. AKERMAN: Yeah, but do you think, let\u2019s say the facts came out that way. Do you think somebody should be impeached for that? POLLAK: Well, you used a very interesting word, which was \u2018improper\u2019 and that word has come up over and over again. AKERMAN: I used the word \u2018proper.\u2019 Is it proper for a \u2014 POLLAK: \u2014 \u2018Is it proper?,\u2019 but you didn\u2019t say, \u2018Is it illegal?\u2019, and I think that\u2019s very interesting \u2014 AKERMAN: \u2014 I\u2019m not asking you that, because \u2014 POLLAK: \u2014 Well, that\u2019s what we\u2019re here to talk about \u2014 AKERMAN: \u2014 But impeachment does not center on legal-illegal, it\u2019s a question of whether or not it\u2019s an impeachable offense under the Constitution. All I\u2019m asking you, \u2018Is it proper?\u2019 Forget even the Constitution. Is it proper for the President of the United States to condition military aid to a foreign country on the receipt of assistance with his reelection campaign? While arguing in favor of impeaching the president, Akerman accused Trump of having committed \u201cbribery,\u201d \u201cextortion,\u201d and \u201cconspiracy\u201d to open an investigation of Joe Biden by Ukrainian authorities. \u201cIt\u2019s so bad because it put a country at risk \u2014 Ukraine \u2013in terms of its funding, with Ukrainians being killed every day by the Russians,\u201d said Akerman. \u201cIt put us in a bad way with a country that is trying to get itself out of corruption, elected a new president that ran on a platform of not being corrupt, and here we are trying to corrupt him through this whole process. \u2026 If ever there was an issue that a president ought to be removed on, this is it.\u201d Pollak described Trump\u2019s conversation with Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky as illustrative of the president\u2019s execution of his presidential duties in relation to stewardship of U.S. foreign aid: Donald Trump was acting in the public interest. Even George Kent, the diplomat in the State Department, admitted in the first day of testimony, that it was in the public interest to have Ukraine investigate Burisma for corruption. The president was carrying out the proper discharge of official duty, and certainly it would be odd to solicit a bribe, and then tell the target of that solicitation, to handle the bribe through the attorney general of the United States \u2014 that\u2019s what [Donald Trump] says in the transcript, \u2018Talk to the attorney general.\u2019 You wouldn\u2019t solicit a bribe and then tell the person you want the bribe from to talk to the chief law enforcement officer of the United States. Trump previously withheld aid from Ukraine in 2017 due to concerns about corruption, Pollak noted: One of the witnesses, [Catherine Croft], talks about how this wasn\u2019t the first time President Trump had withheld assistance to Ukraine. [Donald Trump] also did it in late 2017, and one of the reasons he did it \u2014 among others \u2014 was because of concern about corruption in Ukraine under then-President Poroshenko. In fact, she testified [that] the President of the United States sat President Poroshenko down in front of everyone and gave him a lecture about corruption in Ukraine. So the interest in Burisma stems out of a longstanding and earlier interest in cprruption in Ukraine that led to an earlier suspension in aid.

This won\u2019t be easy and it shouldn\u2019t be. But I\u2019m placing my faith in the people who feel left out and left back who just want a fair shot at a better future.

      "author": "Haris Alic",
      "content": " Joe Biden\u2019s campaign is attempting to spin the narrative around his son\u2019s work in Ukraine with a hastily created website as the House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry continues to heat up. The former vice president, who is already trying to salvage his foreign policy credentials after revelations about Hunter Biden\u2019s wheeling and dealing overseas, launched a new website on Thursday to spin the narrative emanating from the inquiry. The site, in particular, attempts to push back on allegations that Hunter Biden\u2019s service on the board of directors of Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian oil and gas giant, intersected with the former vice president\u2019s political influence in eastern Europe.\u00a0To that end, the site aggregates news stories\u00a0from maistream media outlets such as NBC, ABC News, and The Washington Post\u00a0\u00a0portraying the Biden\u2019s conduct as ethical\u2014under a \u201cfacts\u201d header. The site, which is titled \u2018Just the Facts, Folks proclaims: There\u2019s a lot of misinformation and lies out there, so welcome to the one stop shop for the facts about Joe Biden. Stay informed about the truth Trump and his special interests are trying to distract from. Despite the lofty goal, the website has the appearance of a campaign ad rather than a fact sheet. Rather than addressing the alleged conflicts of interest between Hunter and Joe Biden head on, the site\u00a0attempts to pass off the opinions of partisan figures, like former Obama administration speechwriter Jon Favreau, as \u201cfacts.\u201d Added to the mix is that half the front page is devoted to television ads the Biden campaign has recently launched, most of which deal in generic campaign themes. The site also seems to have been thrown together hastily. An outside search by Breitbart News was able to confirm the website\u2019s domain was only purchased\u00a0on November 5, a little more than a week before the House Intelligence Committee was set to begin its impeachment inquiry. The quick timeline was evidenced by a number grammatical errors still visible hours after launch. The site reads when elaborating on why the former vice president is running: At this defining moment in our nation\u2019s history, it\u2019s going to take Joe Biden\u2019s strong leadership to defeat Donald Trump and unite America overseas, separating families at the border, protecting corporations and the wealthy over the middle class,\u00a0and threatening our democracy by pressuring foreign nations to interfere in our elections.  It is unclear what the Biden campaign was attempting to say with that paragraph. Requests for comment were not returned by press time. The website\u2019s launch comes only one day after the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump held its first first public hearing. Even though the hearing was built up as a history-making event\u2014only the fourth time in history Congress has weighed impeachment against a sitting president\u2014it largely backfired on Congressional Democrats. Most notably, one of the Democrats\u2019 star witnesses inadvertently made the argument that Hunter Biden\u2019s work for Burisma should be probed because of the appearance of conflicts of interest and the company\u2019s general perception of being corrupt. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent, who is vital to the Democrats proving Trump\u2019s conduct rose to the level of impeachment, admitted under oath that\u00a0U.S. officials had been urging the Ukrainian government for some time to explain why an investigation into Burisma was shut down. The state department official further admitted he and his colleagues believed Burisma\u2019s founder, Mykola\u00a0Zlochevsky, \u201chad stolen money,\u201d and the Ukrainian prosecutor charged with investigating him shut down the case after taking a bribe. Kent answered when asked if he was in favor of reopening the probe into Bruisma and Zlochevsky: I think since U.S. taxpayer dollars are wasted, I would love to see the Ukrainian prosecutor general\u2019s office find who the corrupt prosecutor was that took the bribe and how much was paid. Kent also asserted that Burisma had a \u201cmixed business reputation,\u201d and Hunter Biden\u2019s decision to join its board of directors had led him to raise concerns with former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s office in 2015. \u201cIn a briefing call with\u2026the office of the Vice President\u2026I raised my concern that Hunter Biden\u2019s status as a [Burisma] board member could create the perception of a conflict of interest,\u201d Kent testified. At the center of controversy is how and why Hunter Biden secured the appointment, which at times paid more than $83,000 a month. As Peter Schweizer, senior contributor at Breitbart News, detailed in his\u00a0book,\u00a0Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends, Hunter Biden had no prior experience with either the energy industry or Ukraine before joining Burisma in April 2014. Adding to concerns is the fact that, at the time Hunter Biden joined Burisma, the company was seen as actively courting western leaders to prevent further scrutiny of its business practices. The same month Hunter Biden was tapped for the group\u2019s board, the government of Great Britain\u00a0froze\u00a0accounts belonging to Zlochevsky under suspicion of money laundering. Zlochevsky, a former Ukrainian minister of natural resources, would later be accused of\u00a0corruption\u00a0for using his office to approve oil and gas licenses to companies under his control. A Ukrainian official with strong ties to Zlochevsky admitted in October the only reason that Hunter Biden secured the appointment was to \u201cprotect\u201d the company from foreign scrutiny. The claim has credence given that at the time, Joe Biden, as the sitting vice president, was tasked with leading the Obama administration\u2019s policy towards Ukraine in response to Russia\u2019s invasion of Crimea. It is in the context of Burisma and Zlochevsky\u2019s legal troubles that Joe Biden\u2019s political influence has raised the most red flags. The former vice president has particularly drawn questions over his conduct in demanding the Ukrainian government fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, in 2016. Joe Biden, who has publicly\u00a0bragged\u00a0about the firing, reportedly threatened to withhold more than one billion\u00a0dollars in U.S. aid if the Ukrainian government did not remove Shokin. He has claimed the demand came from then-President Barack Obama, who had allegedly lost faith in the prosecutor\u2019s ability to tackle corruption. Unofficially, though, it was known that Shokin was investigating both Burisma and Zlochevsky for public corruption. It is uncertain if the probe extended to Hunter Biden, although Shokin has recently admitted that prior to his ouster he was\u00a0warned\u00a0to back off the matter. Regardless of what occurred, Shokin\u2019s successor, who is now himself being\u00a0investigated\u00a0for public corruption,\u00a0dropped the investigation into Burisma and Zlochevsky. Biden\u2019s new website, though, made no mention of those facts on Thursday. Instead the website points to a handful of tweets backing up the former vice president\u2019s side of the story, including the one from Favreau. \u201cA reminder that Joe Biden\u2019s push to get the corrupt Ukrainian prosecutor fired, which was the position of the U.S. government and basically the entire global community, was a move that INCREASED the chances that Burisma would be investigated,\u201d the former Obama speech writer stated.",

The cause of the outburst is not immediately apparent, however\u00a0Biden\u2019s campaign released an ad this week condemning Trump\u2019s foreign policy, saying \u201cdictators and tyrants are praised, our allies pushed aside.\u201d The voiceover says the word \u201ctyrants\u201d at the exact moment a picture appears of U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un shaking hands at their Singapore summit last year. Despite just what drove the attack, Korth Korea was unsparing in its criticism of a man who seeks the highest office in the land. It called Biden, \u201ca profiteer, who ran for the two failed presidential elections, [who] is now going zealous in another presidential election campaign, wandering about like a starving wild dog. He must be a dotard maniac greedy for power.\u201d The rhetorical barbs did not end there.

Anyone who dares slander the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK, can never escape the DPRK\u2019s merciless punishment, whoever and wherever. And he will be made to see even in a grave what horrible consequences will be entailed by his thoughtless utterances. Such rabid dogs as Biden can hurt lots of people if they are allowed to run about. They must be beaten to death with a stick, before it is too late. Doing so will be beneficial to the US, too. It is not the first time the North has condemned Biden.

The rhetoric underscores its \u201cimpatience\u201d with any criticism of Kim, said Cheong Seong-Chang, a senior researcher at the private Sejong Institute. There is no record of Biden\u2019s response to the unprecedented attack as of Friday morning.",

      "subtitle": "Former Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, one of the star witnesses of the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry, on Friday undercut the defense Joe Biden and his allies have been making about the firing of Ukraine\u2019s top prosecutor.",
      "author": "Haris Alic",
      "content": " Yovanovitch, a self-described anti-corruption expert who most recently served as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine between 2016-2019, told the House Intelligence Committee there was an open probe into Burisma Holdings when Joe Biden demanded the firing. Burisma, which is Ukraine\u2019s only private oil conglomerate and until recently\u00a0counted Hunter Biden among its board of directors, is central to the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump. Democrats have argued Trump\u2019s suggestion that the Ukrainian government investigate the company and its ties to the younger Biden amount to an impeachable offense. During Friday\u2019s hearing, Yovanovitch was questioned about the allegations of public corruption that have dogged Burisma and its leadership since the early-2010s. In particular, she was asked about the status of a corruption probe Ukraine had into Burisma when Joe Biden pushed for the ouster of Viktor Shokin, the country\u2019s prosecutor general, in 2016. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t an active case, but it also was not fully closed,\u201d the former ambassador testified, before elaborating that at the time the Ukrainian government was opting to keep a \u201chook\u201d into Burisma and its founder, Mykola Zlochevsky. Yovanovitch\u2019s admission that Shokin was looking for a \u201chook\u201d with which to prosecute Burisma and Zlocvesky undermines a central argument Joe Biden has made to defend his conduct. Since the story became central to the impeachment inquiry, the former vice president and his allies have tried to argue that Shokin\u2019s investigation into Burisma was dormant at the time of his firing and therefore his ouster actually improved the chances that the company would face stricter scrutiny. Former Obama administration speechwriter Jon Favreu tweeted on the first day impeachment inquiry: A reminder that Joe Biden\u2019s push to get the corrupt Ukrainian prosecutor fired, which was the position of the U.S. government and basically the entire global community, was a move that INCREASED the chances that Burisma would be investigated.  The argument has taken on more importance as revelations continue to mount about potential conflicts of interest between Joe Biden\u2019s political influence and his youngest son Hunter\u2019s wheeling and dealing overseas. Specifically father and son have struggled to explain the timing of Hunter Biden\u2019s ascension to Burisma\u2019s board of directors. The younger Biden secured the appointment in 2014 around the same time his father was appointed to oversee Obama administration policy in Ukraine. As Peter Schweizer, senior contributor at Breitbart News,\u00a0detailed\u00a0in his book\u00a0Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends, Hunter Biden secured the position, which\u00a0paid\u00a0as much as\u00a0$83,000 per month, despite having no background in energy or Ukraine. Adding to concerns is the fact that at the time Hunter Biden joined Burisma, the company was seen as actively courting Western leaders to prevent further scrutiny of its business practices. The same month Hunter Biden was tapped for the group\u2019s board, the government of Great Britain froze accounts belonging to Burisma founder Mykola Zlochevsky under suspicion of money laundering. Not only had Zlochevsky had his assets frozen in Great Britain, but the former Ukrainian minister of natural resources was also facing suspicions of public corruption at home. Zlochevsky would later be\u00a0charged\u00a0with corruption for using his ministerial office to approve oil and gas licenses to companies under his control. A Ukrainian official with strong ties to Zlochevsky admitted in October the only reason that Hunter Biden secured the appointment was to \u201cprotect\u201d the company from foreign scrutiny. The claim has credence given that at the time Joe Biden, as the sitting vice president, was tasked with leading the Obama administration\u2019s policy towards Ukraine in response to Russia\u2019s invasion of Crimea. It is in the context of Burisma and Zlochevsky\u2019s legal troubles that Joe Biden\u2019s political influence has raised the most red flags. The former vice president has particularly drawn questions over his conduct in demanding the firing of Shokin, who was leading the probe into Burisma.

On Friday, Yovanovitch admitted during her testimony that convoluted history and the conflicts of interest between the former vice president and his youngest son were topics of concern for Obama administration officials during her confirmation as ambassador to Ukraine in 2016.",

      "author": "Charlie Spiering",
      "content": " Yovanovitch\u00a0demonstrated she was indifferent or even averse to any corruption concerns surrounding Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden and even denied that Ukrainians were meddling in the 2016 election. Yovanovitch dodged direct questions about whether she thought former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden serving on the board of the corrupt Ukrainian gas company Burisma was wrong. \u201cIt was not the focus of what I was doing in that six month period,\u201d she said when asked by\u00a0 Republican counsel Steve Castor about her understanding of Hunter Biden\u2019s role. She even denied that the issue was ever raised while she was the ambassador, pointing to Hunter Biden\u2019s decision to resign from the board after his father decided to run for president. While previous diplomatic officials testifying on Tuesday admitted that Hunter Biden\u2019s role on the Burisma board was problematic, Yovanovitch only admitted that it may have created the \u201cappearance\u201d of a conflict of interest. Twice, Yovanovitch stated that she did not believe that former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s demand that Ukraine fire a prosecutor investigating Burisma had anything to do with his son\u2019s role on the board. \u201cI actually don\u2019t,\u201d she replied, adding, \u201cI don\u2019t think that had anything to do with the Burisma case.\u201d Under additional questioning, she admitted that Hunter Biden\u2019s role on the board \u201ccould raise the appearance of a conflict of interest\u201d but that she did not agree that Biden\u2019s threat to force the prosecutor investigating Burisma was problematic. She also said that she did not ever speak about Hunter Biden\u2019s role with Burisma with the State Department, even after official George Kent raised concerns with the vice president\u2019s office. Rep. Elise Stefanik reminded Yovanovitch that she was even prepared by the Obama State Department on how to answer questions to Congress about Hunter Biden for her Senate confirmation hearing. Under questioning from Rep. John Ratcliffe, Yovanovitch admitted that she was in fact coached by Obama State Department officials to respond to questions about Hunter Biden by referring members of Congress to Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s office. Yovanovitch presented herself as a tough advocate against corruption in the opening of her testimony, even claiming that she was fired by Trump because of her efforts to clean up Ukrainian corruption and the \u201csmear campaign\u201d that followed, launched by former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani But when she was asked about whether it was proper for the president to investigate corruption in Ukraine, she suggested that it was not. \u201cI think it\u2019s appropriate as long as it\u2019s part of our national strategy,\u201d\u00a0 she said, adding that the \u201cproper channel\u201d for such investigations was through the Justice Department. Yovanovitch also appeared uninterested and even denied reports of Ukrainian officials participating in meddling in the 2016 presidential election, by cooperating with Democrat operative Alexandra Chalupa. She was unable to conclusively say whether or not she had ever met with Chalupa. \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d she replied to Castor. \u201cShe works with the Ukraine embassy, it\u2019s possible that I met her in a large group.\u201d Largely ignoring questions about Ukrainian meddling, Yovanovitch repeatedly reverted attention to the intelligence committee assessment of Russia\u2019s attempt to meddle in the Ukrainian election.",

      "subtitle": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) on Friday released her plan to transition the United States to her $52 trillion Medicare for All program, notably holding off on ending private insurance right off the bat and making it part of her second legislative push, which she claims will occur before the end of her first term.",
      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " Warren unveiled her Medicare for All plan in a Medium post this month, proclaiming, proudly, that the multitrillion-dollar plan would not require a tax hike on middle class Americans, even though experts state that it would. Rather, Warren claims she will pay for the plan, in part, via an additional tax hike on the wealthy, cuts on defense spending, and amnesty. The presidential hopeful added to her plan on Friday, explaining how she would transition the country to a Medicare for All system. While she claims the transition would occur entirely in her first term, its enactment would occur under two legislative pushes. She describes the first as a \u201cfast-track budget reconciliation legislation to create a true Medicare for All option that\u2019s free for tens of millions\u201d:  Her plan states: Coverage under the new Medicare for All option will be immediately free for children under the age of 18 and for families making at or below 200% of the federal poverty level (about $51,000 for a family of four). For all others, the cost will be modest, and eventually, coverage under this plan will be free for everyone. Then, \u201cno later\u201d than her third year in office, Warren would \u201cfight to pass legislation that would complete the transition to full Medicare for All,\u201d essentially eliminating the need for private insurance: By this point, the American people will have experienced the full benefits of a true Medicare for All option, and they can see for themselves how that experience stacks up against high-priced care that requires them to fight tooth-and-nail against their insurance company. Per the terms of the Medicare for All Act, supplemental private insurance that doesn\u2019t duplicate the benefits of Medicare for All would still be available. But by avoiding duplicative insurance and integrating every American into the new program, the American people would save trillions of dollars on health costs. Warren believes that the methodical, step by step approach will result in \u201cmillions\u201d of Americans paying less in health care and claims they will see the \u201cquality of their current health coverage improve.\u201d \u201cAnd millions more Americans will have the choice to ditch their private insurance and enter a high-quality public plan,\u201d her plan states, reiterating that it will not result in an increased tax burden for middle class families. \u201cAnd, at each step, the changes in our health care system will be fully paid for without raising taxes one penny on middle class families,\u201d her plan claims. \u201cLet\u2019s not kid ourselves: every Democratic plan for expanding public health care coverage is a challenge to these industries\u2019 bottom lines \u2013 and every one of these plans is already being drowned in money to make sure it never happens,\u201d Warren wrote, adding in a jab to two of her fiercest Democrat critics, Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) and former Vice President Joe Biden (D). \u201cAny candidate who believes more modest reforms will avoid the wrath of industry is not paying attention,\u201d she warned. Warren confirmed at a town hall meeting in Raleigh, North Carolina, this month that her Medicare for All plan will also cover illegal immigrants. \u201cMedicare for All, as I put this together, covers everyone, regardless of immigration status, and that\u2019s it,\u201d Warren told the crowd: ",

      "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/11/16/exclusive-white-houses-tony-sayegh-democrats-went-0-for-3-with-three-star-witnesses-on-impeachment/",
      "subtitle": "Democrats failed to present the public with any evidence that President Donald Trump should be impeached in their first round of public hearings this week, White House Senior Advisor for Strategy Tony Sayegh told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview on Saturday.",
      "author": "Matthew Boyle",
      "content": " Sayegh, who has been brought in by Trump to handle messaging in response to the Democrats\u2019 partisan impeachment inquiry alongside former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, made the case that the Democrats\u2019 three \u201cstar witnesses\u201d on Wednesday and Friday failed to bolster the Democrats\u2019 case for impeachment\u2014and instead actually helped the president\u2019s case and the GOP case against the inquiry. Sayegh\u2019s exclusive interview, his first in the new role in the White House as Trump\u2019s impeachment defender, aired live on Breitbart News Saturday on SiriusXM 125 the Patriot Channel on Saturday morning. In addition to being his first interview in the role as impeachment defender, Sayegh\u2019s interview is also the first and most in-depth commentary the White House has made since the Wednesday hearing with George Kent and Bill Taylor and the Friday hearing with ousted U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch. \u201cWell, look, the Democrats had a chance to present their three star witnesses and they went 0 for 3,\u201d Sayegh said. \u201cAll three witnesses made very clear that there was nothing impeachable that they were discussing that the president did. None of them had any contact or conversations or even knowledge, direct knowledge, of what the president said on the July 25 call, which is the call in question. All three of them confirmed that they thought the Trump administration had a better Ukraine policy ultimately than the Obama administration because of the deliverance of lethal military aid for Ukraine and they made clear, especially Taylor and Kent, that Ukraine received the military aid and the support unconditionally. So, they obviously helped debunk the entire baseless narrative Democrats have decided to base this impeachment inquiry on which is quid pro quo. So what do Democrats do? They are now trying to change the conversation, change the language\u2014they are now trying to call it a \u2018bribe.\u2019 That\u2019s laughable, I think you and I both know for something to be a \u2018bribe\u2019 you have to get something in return. We gave the Ukrainians more than they\u2019ve gotten from past administrations and it was all unconditional.\u201d Sayegh also said the weakness of the Democrats\u2019 case on substance was on display for the public, which proves why House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) has run most of the impeachment inquiry behind closed doors unnecessarily in order to collect and weaponize through leaks out of context information meant to create a narrative damaging to Trump even if it\u2019s not entirely true. Overall, though, Sayegh said the White House is pleased with how this week of hearings has gone because it shows the Democrat case to be \u201cclearly thin and weak,\u201d while the Democrats\u2019 star witnesses actually proved the White House\u2019s narrative and undermined the Democrat narrative. \u201cThe bottom line remains the president did nothing wrong, and I think these three \u2018star witnesses\u2019 detail that very clearly. It\u2019s the reason why Adam Schiff has to do this process first in private because the only way he could get even some energy behind these proceedings is by leaking selective parts of their testimony,\u201d Sayegh said. \u201cWe feel at the end of this week that the substance of the Democrats\u2019 case is clearly thin and weak, and we think their star witnesses actually proved our point, which we\u2019ve been making all along and the president has been saying all along, which is the president did nothing wrong.\u201d Sayegh pointed to two key moments from Wednesday and Friday, too, when all three of the Democrats\u2019 first public witnesses testified they did not have evidence of a crime or an impeachable offense by Trump. During questioning from Rep. John Ratcliffe (R-TX) on Wednesday, both Taylor and Kent were silent when he asked them if they had any evidence the president should be impeached. On Friday, even more damning for the Democrats, Yovanovitch testified in the negative answering a question from Rep. Chris Stewart (R-UT) \u201cno\u201d when he asked both if she had evidence the president committed a crime or if she had evidence the president committed an impeachable offense. Sayegh also ripped Schiff for silencing Republicans, including Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY), when they raise legitimate points of order or ask for unanimous consent to enter into the record documents and other pieces of evidence. \u201cThe moment especially with Ambassador Taylor and Mr. Kent on Wednesday when Congressman Ratcliffe just looked at the both of them and said, \u2018Hey you guys are the star witnesses, what\u2019s impeachable here?\u2019\u201d Sayegh said. \u201cThe silence was deafening, because it\u2019s very clear there is nothing there. When you see the way Adam Schiff has been conducting even the public hearings, it\u2019s embarrassing. This is not due process. This is not democracy. He shuts down Elise Stefanik, he tries to clash every time a Republican brings up a legitimate point of order in exposing how this process is completely controlled by him and only him. It\u2019s really not the way our democracy should be working.\u201d Sayegh also ripped into Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA) for at one point saying that Schiff is above being questioned. Sayegh argued this behavior from Swalwell on Schiff\u2019s behalf is not representative of the values the United States has in terms of the judicial process, and more proof this is a \u201csham\u201d impeachment inquiry. \u201cThere was a point in the deliberation on Wednesday, where I think it was Congressman Swalwell\u2014one of Schiff\u2019s minions and deputies\u2014who actually tried to say that the chair cannot be questioned, that that was not permissible,\u201d Sayegh said. \u201cCould you imagine we have a congressional proceeding, a hearing, in the United States of America\u2014not another country, not another time, but in 2019 in the United States of America\u2014where questioning the chair is not permissible? It\u2019s not permitted? I mean, this continues to expose what we\u2019ve been saying all along\u2014this impeachment process is a sham.\u201d Sayegh added, too, that the way to resolve disagreements with the executive branch is not through sham impeachment inquiries like the one the Democrats are running, but instead through elections\u2014and the next one is just a year away. \u201cLook, if you don\u2019t like what the president did or you don\u2019t like what the president said, you have an election,\u201d Sayegh said. \u201cIt\u2019s less than a year away. Run against him. That\u2019s what we did with Barack Obama. We didn\u2019t like Fast and Furious. We didn\u2019t like the IRS targeting scandal. We didn\u2019t like the fact he used the Department of Justice to spy on reporters. We ran against him. We lost. We didn\u2019t like how Hillary conducted the Benghazi raid. We ran against her on the issue. We won. That\u2019s how elections in democracies work. It\u2019s not circumventing the process and rigging the process so you get the outcome you want. It\u2019s about leaving it up to the voters. Don\u2019t forget what this is all about: This is about the fact that Democrats are still upset about the results of the 2016 election and have been on a focused crusade and witch hunt since that time to remove Donald Trump as president. What\u2019s accelerated this process is they know the president will win again in 2020 if they don\u2019t try to do something different. This is not interfering in just the 2016 election, this is trying to circumvent the 2020 election and I really think that\u2019s a huge injustice to the American people.\u201d What\u2019s more, with the president facing these impeachment hearings in the House of Representatives, the public has grown disinterested with the Democrats\u2019 tactics as evidenced by the low television ratings the hearings this week received. On Wednesday, just 13 million Americans watched the first hearing\u2014millions upon millions less than the Brett Kavanaugh hearings in 2018 and even less than the previous hearings with former FBI Director James Comey. \u201cAll along, we know the president\u2019s done nothing wrong so there\u2019s absolutely no concern on our part that the hearings were going to reveal anything or say anything,\u201d Sayegh said. \u201cThe concern is are they able to fool the public or are they able to create some sort of false narrative that gets hold in the country. Look, as you point out, the Comey hearings had over 20 million viewers, the Kavanaugh hearings had close to 20 million, around 19 million. They had just 13 million viewers on this thing. The country is clearly disinterested in this charade and the fact that the Democrats are playing impeachment while the president is trying to govern. People care more about what affects their lives. I\u2019ll tell you something: You know, Matt, we\u2019ve known each other for a few years now and most of my career has been spent in political strategy and media. I\u2019ll never forget a lesson I learned, actually from a Democrat strategist years ago, who actually ran a campaign\u2014and I\u2019ll leave the players out of this one\u2014but he ran a campaign against my candidate and my candidate won. He said to me, \u2018At the end of the day, you guys at least talked about the issues people care about, my guy would only talk about the issues he cared about.\u2019 That\u2019s how you lose: when you talk about what you care about, not what people care about. That\u2019s what I think we see the Democrats doing right now.\u201d Sayegh also made the case that he believes the Democrats very well could lose their majority in the House over these hearings, and that Trump will win re-election because of it all. The Democrats have zero big-picture legislative accomplishments since retaking the majority in last year\u2019s midterm elections, despite campaign trail promises to stand up for Americans\u2019 health care, to rebuild the nation\u2019s infrastructure, to help Americans on the economy, and to work with the president on a number of other fronts of bipartisan support. They have abandoned all of that, and any hope of serious big-picture legislation, to pursue the impeachment agenda they have fallen into. \u201cWednesday for me, if we\u2019re going to kind of fast forward and have a discussion a year ago from today, let\u2019s say November 16, 2020, and we say to ourselves, \u2018Wow, not only did the president win re-election, but the Democrats lost the House. Why?\u2019\u201d Sayegh said. \u201cIt\u2019s for all the reasons you said right now. The president has been focused on strengthening our economy, improving our trade deals, rolling back regulations, strengthening the military, trying to address the issues that prevent our workers from having a level playing field around the world. What have we seen? We\u2019ve seen strong wage gains, strong economic growth, people are seeing the benefits of the strongest economy in the world, which is very important for us, we wanted more people to be able to participate in our economy when they weren\u2019t able to prior. When you think about the fact that the president has been the most willing, certainly of any Republican president in my lifetime, to work with Democrats on so many issues, drug pricing, infrastructure, criminal justice reform\u2014so many issues that you could previously say were on partisan lines, you have President Trump who\u2019s always willing, always with an open door and an open mind. You have Democrats choosing, instead of working with him on these real issues, choosing to come up with these phony impeachment charges because they\u2019re so afraid he\u2019s going to have four more years. But you know who wants him to have four more years? The people in this country who have benefitted from the fact that you have a president who care more about them than the swamp, who cares more about them than any other special interest, his special interest are the people of the United States of America.\u201d Sayegh continued by noting that Trump\u2019s unprecedented transparency\u2014the release of the transcript of his call with Ukraine\u2019s President Zelensky is a good example\u2014contrasts with the Democrats\u2019 decision to just plow forward with impeachment proceedings regardless of the lack of factual support for their case. \u201cYou see his [Trump\u2019s] sincerity, his authenticity, at his rallies and anytime he speaks,\u201d Sayegh said. \u201cAnd, by the way, let me tell you something else as somebody who\u2019s been in media, who\u2019s been in politics, let\u2019s say a couple decades seeing presidents and how they operate. This is the most transparent president we have ever had bar none. Literally bar none, this is literally the most open, honest, and transparent president we have ever had. Think about the fact that the entire impeachment surrounds a phone call on July 25\u2014guess what the president did? He gave the American people the transcript of that phone call and said: \u2018Look at it and judge it for yourself.\u2019 Guess what Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff did? They launched an impeachment inquiry before they even had a chance to do that. So when you think about the opportunities we are given by being a part of this government and this great democracy, it\u2019s a sacred and and solemn opportunity to help the American people. So, how do you use that? How do you use that opportunity? We know how Donald Trump has used it. You talked about USMCA, over 100,000 jobs for our hardworking Americans. That\u2019s a massive economic opportunity for so many Americans. That\u2019s the biggest trade deal with our biggest trading partners, between Mexico and Canada. That\u2019s how he spends his time, that\u2019s how he spends his energy. What do the Democrats do? They give you pretty lame TV on trumped up impeachment charges that are never going to amount to a hill of beans in a hyper partisan unprecedented attack on the American presidency.\u201d When the Democrats finally held a floor vote a couple weeks ago officially cementing their impeachment inquiry that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) announced more than a month earlier via press conference, it was only Democrats\u2014not all of them, but most of them\u2014who voted for it. All Republicans in the House voted against it, and joining them were two Democrats Reps. Collin Peterson (D-MN) and Jeff Van Drew (D-NJ). That means the impeachment inquiry is purely partisan in nature, with bipartisan opposition to what Pelosi and Schiff are doing. Peterson and Van Drew both represent districts that Trump won in 2016. There are 29 more such Democrats in \u201cTrump districts\u201d across the country, and for the GOP to retake the House majority in 2020 they would need to retake a net 19 seats\u2014making retaking the House very possible for Republicans. Sayegh said those Trump district Democrats, given the weakness of Schiff\u2019s case for impeachment and the fact the Democrats\u2019 own witnesses are bolstering the case against impeachment, are likely to face enormous pressure to oppose articles of impeachment if the Democrat leadership ever does call such a vote. \u201cI kind of frame things by looking at things and turning them around. So I put myself in the position of, let\u2019s pretend I\u2019m a Democrat who doesn\u2019t like the president and wants to see him impeached,\u201d Sayegh said. \u201cI would be furious right now at the way Adam Schiff and Nancy Pelosi have conducted themselves. If I\u2019m one of these congressmen, don\u2019t forget\u2014I think we need about 16 or maybe you\u2019re right maybe it\u2019s 19, the math shifts depending on how many are there in the chamber at any time, 19 Democrats to vote against this. We already got two on the procedural vote because they know this thing was done so poorly, and without public support, without a justification and circumventing the president\u2019s due process rights. My colleague Pam Bondi who\u2019s joining me next week and preparing to be part of the president\u2019s team on strategy and communications in Washington and the White House. She\u2019s a former prosecutor. She said someone with a speeding ticket infraction has been given more due process rights than the president has by Adam Schiff in this situation. So, if I\u2019m a Democrat and I think this president legitimately needs to be held accountable, I hate the way they\u2019ve done it. They\u2019ve done it in such an underhanded and unethical way that I think it\u2019s ultimately going to be too much for a lot of these Democrats who are in these Trump districts to support. They\u2019ve not built a justification. They\u2019ve not built the legitimate foundation of a case that they would have to build to convince anybody who\u2019s objective, and I\u2019m for a moment that there\u2019s some objective people in the Democrat conference, to take that very risky vote. For what though? If you\u2019re a Democrat in a Trump district, I think Collin Peterson and Congressman Van Drew clearly made this calculation\u2014and I think there\u2019s a few others who will\u2014are you going to take a vote to impeach the president on such frivolous and weak grounds to only have it go to the Senate and die?\u201d Sayegh also said that Republicans are more unified than ever after the first two Democrat hearings, and he expects that GOP unity will continue and carry the party back into the House majority and Trump back into the White House next year. \u201cWe have ended this week, I think one of the most important things is as Republicans on both the House and the Senate side and in the White House, we have ended this week more unified than we have been for years,\u201d Sayegh said. \u201cThe Democrats in the way they\u2019ve proceeded, the way they\u2019ve conducted themselves in this impeachment jam, have only strengthened that unity. I think it\u2019s going to be extraordinarily difficult for a lot of these Democrats to take that vote in a way that leads to impeachment but look I also know how Washington works and I know how hyper partisan the dynamic is today that at the same time I would not be surprised to see people take such a blindly partisan vote. Speaker Pelosi, who frankly I have respect for and I think has been up until now a rather adroit leader of the opposition, but she was sold something and she took the bait for whatever reason. I\u2019m not exactly sure why, but maybe in the next few weeks we\u2019ll learn if this continues to go on what the real motive is, but I think it\u2019s a fool\u2019s errand and I think it\u2019s going to be the bedrock of why the Republicans will retake the House along with winning another term for Donald Trump.\u201d Sayegh concluded the interview by discussing the serious revelations the Democrat witnesses\u2019 testimony brought forth about former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden. Hunter Biden\u2019s position on the board of Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma Holdings has drawn significant scrutiny, and all three Democrat witnesses testified this week there were serious issues with it. Kent testified that he raised the concerns within the Obama administration, and Yovanovitch testified that she was briefed on the matter with talking points by the Obama State Department when she was facing Senate confirmation to be ambassador to Ukraine in 2016. Both Kent and Yovanovitch referred lawmakers back to former Vice President Biden\u2019s official office for more information. GOP lawmakers, who do not have subpoena power since they are in the minority in the House, have been trying to get more information about these concerns\u2014which all three Democrat witnesses confirmed are authentic\u2014and have tried to bring in Hunter Biden and his business business partner Devon Archer to testify in these impeachment inquiry hearings. But, Schiff and the Democrat leadership in the House majority are obstructing the investigation despite their own witnesses confirming the problems with regard to the conflicts of interest within the Biden family. Nonetheless, Sayegh said particularly Stefanik bringing up with Yovanovitch the Obama State Department confirmation hearing preparation materials on Hunter Biden and Burisma was a \u201cpowerful moment.\u201d \u201cThat was a really powerful moment that Congresswoman Stefanik\u2019s questioning presented,\u201d Sayegh said. \u201cWhen we watch these, as you pointed out before kind of boring hearings, there\u2019s a moment here or there that kind of jump off the chart and that was one of them. The idea that even the Obama administration\u2019s State Department was so concerned about the appearance of impropriety with Hunter Biden\u2019s contract with Burisma, an energy firm in Ukraine, when he has no prior knowledge of or experience in dealing with business in Ukraine, no prior knowledge or experience in the energy sector, yet somehow as the Vice President\u2019s son gets this kind of job. I think when you saw the Republicans asking Chairman Schiff during this testimony by Yovanovitch and as you said also kind of corroborated by Mr. Kent kind of requires Hunter Biden to come in and testify but Mr. Schiff completely, completely railroaded that idea and called them out of order and would not let them have the floor\u2014and I think that\u2019s because there\u2019s a lot of there there.\u201d LISTEN TO TONY SAYEGH ON BREITBART NEWS SATURDAY: ",

      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " The former president spoke to a group of liberal donors in Washington, DC, on Friday and suggested that the far-left ideas articulated and pursued by some of the candidates in the Democrat primary could turn away potential voters. \u201cEven as we push the envelope and we are bold in our vision we also have to be rooted in reality,\u201d Obama said, according to the New York Times. \u201cThe average American doesn\u2019t think we have to completely tear down the system and remake it.\u201d Obama refrained from naming a specific candidate, but he, according to the Times, \u201ccautioned that the universe of voters that could support a Democratic candidate \u2014 Democrats, independents, and moderate Republicans \u2014 are not driven by the same views reflected on \u2018certain left-leaning Twitter feeds\u2019 or \u2018the activist wing of our party.\u2019\u201d Obama\u2019s mention of \u201ccertain left-leaning Twitter feeds\u201d almost hints to the \u201cSquad\u201d \u2013\u00a0Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Ilhan Omar (D-MN) Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), and Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) \u2013\u00a0whose members frequently take to Twitter to express their unfiltered critiques of President Trump and offer their ultra-leftist, borderline socialist views. Ocasio-Cortez, Tlaib, and Omar eagerly endorsed Sanders, who has called for a \u201cpolitical revolution,\u201d promising massive proposals such as Medicare for All, a Green New Deal, and \u201cfree\u201d college and \u201cfree\u201d universal childcare. Pressley veered from her colleagues, throwing her weight behind Warren, who has also proposed ultra-far left proposals, including Medicare for All and an \u201cUltra-Millionaire\u201d tax. Obama continued, according to the Times: I don\u2019t think we should be deluded into thinking that the resistance to certain approaches to things is simply because voters haven\u2019t heard a bold enough proposal and if they hear something as bold as possible then immediately that\u2019s going to activate them. \u201cFor those who get stressed about robust primaries, I just have to remind you I had a very robust primary,\u201d Obama added. \u201cI\u2019m confident that at the end of the process we will have a candidate that has been tested.\u201d Obama has yet to throw his support behind any of the current Democrat candidates, including his former running mate and vice president Joe Biden (D). Obama ally Deval Patrick (D), former governor of Massachusetts, recently jumped into the race \u00ad\u2013 a move Breitbart News\u2019s John Nolte described as a slap in the face to Biden: Well, Patrick and Obama\u00a0are close. In fact, Obama tried to talk Patrick into running last year, but was turned down. Patrick feared the ugliness of the race, his wife was ill, and he was probably thrilled to be making a pile of money giving women cancer. But Patrick is getting in now, isn\u2019t he? And it is more than fair to assume he\u2019s getting in because Obama begged him to. The reasons are obvious\u2026 As is being reported everywhere, the smoke-filled-room fellas, the leaders of the Democrat Party, the money men, the Obamas, etc., are terrified of Warren\u2019s socialistic tendencies, know Buttigieg is too young and too gay\u2026 But most of all they know Old Joe Biden just doesn\u2019t have the stuff. To be fair, Slow Joe never had the stuff. He\u2019s always been a terrible presidential candidate, and there are reports Obama tried to discourage him from running. Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, another major Obama figure, is also reportedly considering a longshot presidential bid, further adding to the growing belief that establishment Democrats \u2013\u00a0Obama and Hillary Clinton included \u2013\u00a0are increasingly worried by what the current Democrat field has to offer.",

      "subtitle": "South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg is under fire for allegedly faking black support in a campaign email in late October that claimed 400 African-Americans in South Carolina had endorsed his \u201cDouglass Plan\u201d for equality.",
      "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
      "content": " The Douglass Plan, named for the (Republican) former slave and abolitionist, proposes a variety of policies aimed at helping black Americans, alongside a committee to study the issue of reparations, which Buttigieg also backs. The plan is partly aimed at addressing Buttigieg\u2019s persistent weakness among black voters, which is partly the result of difficulties in his relationship with the black community in South Bend. He fired the city\u2019s first black police chief, then faced criticism from the black community after an officer-involved shooting earlier this year. When he tried to make amends by accusing the police department of racism, he faced criticism from law enforcement as well. As The Intercept reported Friday (original links): When pressed on the lack of black support, Buttigieg and his campaign have made repeated references to the Douglass Plan, named for abolitionist Frederick Douglass. \u201cOur response to those who ask what our agenda for black America is, is the Douglass Plan.\u201d Buttigieg said recently on CNN. \u201cIt is the most comprehensive vision put forward by a 2020 candidate on the question of how we\u2019re going to tackle systemic racism in this country.\u201d \u2026 The campaign hasn\u2019t publicly claimed that every supporter of the plan listed is African American, though it wouldn\u2019t be hard to draw that implication: It was published in the HBCU Times, and the bylines and top-listed supporters are all black. To be sure, a multiracial coalition would be needed to push the Douglass Plan through Congress, but the campaign didn\u2019t say that, either. After publication, the Buttigieg campaign said it had sent the plan to the list of supporters and asked them to opt out if they did not want their name included on the list. That email also specified that the list was meant to represent \u201cover 400 Black South Carolinians.\u201d In an email sent by the campaign, Buttigieg touted support from 400 black South Carolinians, according to Slate. But as The Intercept reported, not all of those who signed on were black \u2014 and not all who signed on were aware that they had. Three of the signatories, one of whom has already endorsed Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), were shocked to see that the Buttigieg campaign was touting their support when they had not, in fact, backed the plan. Moreover: Whatever the intent, a review of the 422 names on the list of supporters finds that at least 297 of them appear in the South Carolina voter file. \u2026\u00a0But for 184 of them, the voter file lists either one name, or lists multiple people, all of whom self-identify as white \u2014\u00a0so\u00a0at least 42 percent of the entire list is white. And that means 62 percent of the 297 names that can be reliably checked are white. Other names, the Intercept reported, are repeated, or are from outside the U.S. Slate published the Buttigieg campaign\u2019s response to the story, claiming it never meant to mislead anyone \u2014 but revealing that it had used an \u201copt-out\u201d process, rather than specifically asking \u201csupporters\u201d to opt into the plan: In the HBCU Times op-ed and in communications with the press, we\u2019ve been clear that not every supporter of the plan is Black, and have never claimed otherwise in any public communication. We never gave the impression publicly that these people were endorsing Pete, only that they supported the plan. After they indicated their support, we reached out to people multiple times giving them the opportunity to review the language of the op-ed and the option to opt-out. We did hear from people who weren\u2019t comfortable being listed and we removed them. Moreover, according to the Intercept\u2019s Ryan Grim, the Buttigieg campaign used a stock photo from Kenya to promote the Douglass Plan:  The latest poll in South Carolina has Buttigieg in a distant fourth place, at 8%, behind former Vice President Joe Biden, who leads the field with 45%, followed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) at 17% and Sanders at 15%. Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

Still, the presidential hopeful stressed the importance of more scientific research to determine \u201cwhether or not there are any things that relate to whether it\u2019s a gateway drug or not.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez, a staunch support of Sen.

We are going to legalize it, expunge past convictions and invest in communities of color that have been devastated by the War on Drugs,\u201d he wrote:  Sanders unveiled a massive proposal to decriminalize marijuana in October, promising to do so via executive action within his first 100 days in office. He also vowed to \u201cexpunge past convictions of marijuana related offenses, and ensure that victims of the War on Drugs are not passed over by the burgeoning marijuana industry.\u201d Additionally, Sanders promised to reinvest in communities most impacted by the \u201cWar on Drugs.\u201d He said he will do that, in part, by creating a $10 billion federal program to help former convicts work in the marijuana industry. Per his plan, the program will \u201chelp disproportionately impacted areas and individuals who have been arrested for or convicted of marijuana offenses start urban and rural farms and urban and rural marijuana growing operations to ensure people impacted by the war on drugs have access to the entire marijuana industry.\u201d The federal programs will \u201cprovide formerly incarcerated individuals with training and resources needed to start their own businesses and worker owned businesses, and guarantee jobs and free job training at trade schools and apprenticeship programs related to marijuana businesses,\u201d according to his proposal.",

      "content": " It will feature ten candidates \u2014 including former Vice President Joe Biden and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, whose campaigns have been moving in opposite directions lately. Buttigieg is still in a distant fourth in the nationwide RealClearPolitics poll average, but has surged to the fore in Iowa and is doing well in other early primary states. Biden still holds a lead in South Carolina, where he is relying on strong support from African-American voters. However, he is no longer the clear nationwide frontrunner. One thing the two have in common, however, is that they both avoid post-debate spin rooms. Buttigieg made a brief appearance on a news set after the third debate, in Houston, in September, but barely ventured into the area where journalists were standing, and ignored questions.  Biden has avoided spin rooms entirely, sending surrogates instead. Most candidates use their time in the spin room to elaborate on points they made in the debate, and to generate additional media exposure. Donald Trump, notably, lingered in the spin room after Republican debates in the 2016 campaign. But there are risks: candidates can be caught off guard, and venture off message, in spin room clashes. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) has appeared occasionally in spin rooms; Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) spoke to reporters at length in the spin room after the first Democrat debate in Miami, Florida, and has been more reticent \u00a0since then. Neither, however, has avoided the spin room to the same extent that Biden and Buttigieg have done. Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

Biden made waves over the weekend after expressing skepticism of legalizing marijuana at the federal level, contending that there is \u201cnot nearly\u201d enough evidence to definitively determine if it acts as a \u201cgateway drug.\u201d \u201cThe truth of the matter is, there\u2019s not nearly been enough evidence that has been acquired as to whether or not it is a gateway drug,\u201d Biden told an audience in Las Vegas, Nevada, over the weekend. \u201cIt\u2019s a debate, and I want a lot more before I legalize it nationally.

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) \u2014 who has vowed to legalize marijuana within the first 100 days in the office via executive order and create federal programs designed to help former convicts secure jobs in the marijuana industry \u2014 and his supporter Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY).   Modine\u2019s remark encompasses the growing frustration among many Democrats \u2014 Democrats who are not excited about Biden or confident in his ability to go head-to-head with President Trump in a general election matchup. The sentiment has been reflected in recent polls, showing Biden, who was once believed to be the secure, almost unbeatable frontrunner, slowly slipping into political oblivion. A George Washington University Politics Poll released last month showed Biden dropping to third place, behind both Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Sanders. An Iowa poll released later in the month showed Biden flopping to fourth place in the Hawkeye State, behind Warren, Sanders, and Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D), who has experienced a significant surge in the state in recent weeks. The most recent Economist/YouGov poll\u00a0shows Biden trailing Warren with 23 percent to Warren\u2019s 26 percent, while the most recent Reuters/Ipsos poll shows the former vice president losing his once-held definitive lead, tying with Sanders with 19 percent support.   The Biden campaign\u2019s cash flow also speaks to the presidential hopeful\u2019s festering issues. His campaign only managed to raise $15.2 million in the third quarter \u2014 a number that paled in comparison to the $25.3 million raised by Sanders and $24.6 million touted by Warren \u2014 and reported just $9 million cash on hand. \u201cHis rivals, on the other hand, still have campaign coffers brimming with cash, especially Sanders who finished the reporting period with more than $33 million on hand,\u201d as Breitbart News noted.",

      "author": "Matthew Boyle",
      "content": " America First Policies, the president\u2019s official Super PAC, gave Breitbart News on Monday an exclusive sneak peek at findings from its focus group work nationwide in the last month. The organization has now conducted 18 separate focus groups in nine different American cities since late October. Those cities include Des Moines, Iowa, Orlando, Florida, Charlotte, North Carolina, Phoenix, Arizona, Miami, Florida, Atlanta, Georgia, Columbus, Ohio, Detroit, Michigan, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. America First Policies has gathered 36 total hours of focus group data from the participants, all of whom are independents or swing voters in their respective cities. The biggest takeaway from all the groups, including one in Pittsburgh thatwas conducted after the first House Intelligence Committee public impeachment hearing last Wednesday that featured State Department officials Bill Taylor and George Kent, is that swing voters are not being moved in the slightest against Trump by the impeachment narrative Democrats are offering. America First Policies screened footage from these focus groups for Breitbart News at their headquarters\u00a0 just outside the nation\u2019s capital on Monday afternoon, including the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, group that was filmed after that first Democrat impeachment hearing. When the moderator asked the room if anyone thinks Donald Trump should be impeached, not a single person in the room\u2014all independents, most of whom do not like Trump\u2019s personality\u2014said they did. After a moment of silence when the focus group conductor asked the room of independents if Trump should be impeached, a man finally said: \u201cNot even close.\u201d The man continued when asked why the Democrats are pushing for impeachment: This is their platform. This is all they got\u2014and what they got is nothing. They want to keep to politics and Trump is not a politician. They are going to do everything they can because he bucked the system. He exposed what the draining the swamp and everything means. That\u2019s the thing\u2014they don\u2019t even have anything close to valid. It\u2019s just nothing. Instead of focusing on policies, they\u2019re trying to do this to win the election. When the moderator asks another man how House Intelligence Committee chairman Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) has done handling the impeachment inquiry so far, he replies: \u201cI don\u2019t know because I can\u2019t believe half of what the media puts out because they\u2019re biased\u2014and there\u2019s been no proof on the table.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not all Trump\u2026 I\u2019m not a party voter,\u201d that man continues. \u201cBut he calls it like it is. He\u2019s a renegade\u2026 Do I respect the man? I don\u2019t. But I respect the office. But I don\u2019t see where they have enough to say he knew about it so\u2026\u201d Up next was a woman, who said she is not a Trump supporter but thinks the president is getting railroaded: I\u2019m not a Trump supporter by any means, but I totally disagree with what they\u2019re doing. I know he\u2019s not perfect, but by the same coin he\u2019s right there and he tells you how it is. I don\u2019t agree with all of the things. But at least he\u2019s trying to do things. After that another woman and another man\u2014both of whom are not Trump supporters\u2014made the case that Democrats\u2019 impeachment goals are meaningless because the Senate will clear Trump even if the House impeaches him. \u201cSadly, I don\u2019t feel\u2014just because they\u2019ll stick to party lines\u2014that this will go anywhere,\u201d the woman said. \u201cAnd they have to know that, so then you have to ask why they\u2019re doing this,\u201d the man added. \u201cCorrect,\u201d the woman concurred. \u201cIt\u2019s just a waste of the taxpayers\u2019 money.\u201d Another man said he thinks the Democrats are doing it so Trump \u201chas an asterisk next to his name going into the next election.\u201d He went on: But another thing is I think it shows a weakness, or a lack of confidence, in the Democrat field and concern that their eventual candidate can\u2019t beat Donald Trump. Otherwise, why would you be doing this a year out from the election? This dismissal of impeachment was a consistent theme throughout the focus groups that America First Policies conducted throughout the country. Generally speaking, most of the focus groups\u2014video from all of which Breitbart News reviewed in America First\u2019s northern Virginia offices\u2014had no supporters of even the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry. The handful of those that did support an actual inquiry\u2014because they want elected leaders like Trump to face scrutiny and they support investigations, not because they think he actually did anything wrong\u2014certainly do not think there is enough evidence to impeach, never mind convict Trump and remove him from office. A woman in the North Carolina focus group, for instance, said Democrats are \u201cwasting a lot of time and money\u201d pursuing Trump\u2019s impeachment and should instead \u201cget back to doing what they\u2019re supposed to be doing, passing laws.\u201d A man in that group also summed up what independents are thinking, dismissing the Democrats\u2019 impeachment agenda: When the news of this first broke, I was sitting there thinking okay these are conversations that mostly went on and then you step back and look what they are\u2014from what media outlet\u2014and you go, okay, his personality is arrogant. We\u2019ve all seen him say something stupid. However, on the flip side of that, all this secrecy\u2014the smoke and mirrors\u2014the unwillingness to unmask the whistleblower out of fears of safety. Come on. What are you hiding? These sentiments on impeachment were not the only thing that America First\u2019s focus groups uncovered. Another consistent theme is that while these independent swing voters like President Trump\u2019s policies and what he\u2019s accomplished for the country, they do not like his personality or his tweets. Generally speaking, the swing voters wish Trump would tweet less attacks on opponents\u2014and not say certain things sometimes. But they did also reveal that while the voters find Trump\u2019s abrasive personality off-putting at times, they do like that he is a \u201cstreet fighter\u201d in the words of one and that he has exposed corruption in the federal government. Perhaps most importantly for Trump, the voters do not see him as part of the political system\u2014they do not consider Trump a \u201cpolitician,\u201d despite the fact he\u2019s been in office for nearly three years now\u2014and they still consider him an outsider or \u201crenegade,\u201d in the words of one Pittsburgh-area independent. What\u2019s more, America First\u2019s focus groups also uncovered a lot of sentiment among independents about several of the top Democrat presidential candidates. Regarding former Vice President Joe Biden, top terms focus group participants used were \u201ctoo old,\u201d \u201cforgetful,\u201d and \u201cObama\u2019s second hand.\u201d They also described Biden as a \u201ccreep\u201d who makes unwanted advances against young women and as \u201cthe swamp,\u201d a sign that America First Policies officials believe demonstrates that attacks on Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden are breaking through to voters nationwide. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is described as a \u201csocialist,\u201d \u201coutspoken,\u201d a \u201cliar,\u201d and \u201cacademic.\u201d Warren\u2019s history of falsely claiming to be a Native American has broken through, as several of the independent voters in the focus groups across the country called Warren \u201cPocahontas.\u201d Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, meanwhile, was described as \u201ctoo old,\u201d \u201cangry,\u201d \u201ccrazy,\u201d and \u201csocialist.\u201d Another interesting finding from these focus groups is that these independent voters do not see much of a difference between any of the Democrats, even when there are actual policy-specific nuances separating them. For instance, when former Rep. Robert Francis \u201cBeto\u201d O\u2019Rourke (D-TX) called for door-to-door gun confiscation and mandatory government-controlled buybacks of Americans\u2019 firearms before he later dropped out of the presidential race, one woman in a North Carolina focus group expressed outrage at the whole Democrat field over it. She said: \u201cI watched ten minutes of the Democratic debate and when I heard somebody talking about taking your guns I thought \u2018you just fucking killed yourself.\u2019 What was he talking about when he was saying he was going to take our guns?\u201d \u201cNo way in hell are they getting our guns,\u201d another woman said. The woman did not use the name \u201cBeto O\u2019Rourke\u201d when expressing her frustrations with Democrats on gun confiscation, but just broadly spoke of all the Democrats like this. America First Policies officials told Breitbart News that generally speaking on issues like gun confiscation, illegal immigration, and healthcare\u2014particularly the backing of the government takeover of healthcare through \u201cMedicare For All\u201d\u2014these focus group voters do not see much nuance between the different Democrats\u2019 plans and policy visions, a problem for Democrats as swing voters are painting them all with a broad brush into radically leftist socialist positions. What\u2019s more, the only two Democrat candidates for president these focus group independent swing voters spoke highly of were Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) and businessman Andrew Yang. The swing voters, the America First Policies officials told Breitbart News, like Gabbard\u2019s military service and the fight she just got in with 2016 Democrat nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton. As for Yang, they said, the voters are intrigued by his different kinds of ideas like the universal basic income idea.",

      "author": "John Binder",
      "content": " The latest Pew Research Center survey finds that about six-in-ten moderate Democrat voters said they believe increased security along the United States-Mexico border is very or somewhat important \u2014 a policy that is opposed by leading 2020 Democrat presidential candidates like former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT). Among all Democrat and lean-Democrat voters, nearly half said they believe increased border and immigration controls are very or somewhat important \u2014 including nearly 40 percent of self-identified liberals. When it comes to deportations of illegal aliens, more than four-in-ten moderate Democrat voters said they support increasing the number of illegal aliens who are deported from the U.S. About 31 percent of all Democrat and lean-Democrat voters support increasing deportations. The findings are the latest instance where moderate and conservative Democrat voters have broken with 2020 Democrats\u2019 plans for opening the nation\u2019s borders to more illegal and legal immigration beyond the already historically high levels at which about 1.5 million foreign-born residents come to the U.S. every year. A New York Times/Siena College poll this month found that a majority of Biden\u2019s most conservative supporters want less immigration overall to the U.S. As Breitbart News reported, a majority of 54 percent of Biden voters who oppose Warren said they want legal immigration levels reduced. The Democrat Party\u2019s decades-long shift to support endless levels of immigration to the U.S. is primarily driven by white liberals who are plagued with \u201cwhite guilt\u201d and \u201cprivilege awareness,\u201d recent research has found. A July poll by\u00a0NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist showed that a plurality of moderate Democrats \u2014 47 percent \u2014 called providing free healthcare to all illegal aliens a \u201cbad idea.\u201d A majority of 56 percent of moderate voters said the same of the plan which has been endorsed by nearly all 2020 Democrat presidential candidates.

      "subtitle": "The race for the 2020 Democrat presidential nomination may be in flux, with new candidates entering the fray and old ones surging ahead of the Iowa Caucuses, but one thing has remained the same\u2014former Vice President Joe Biden is the undisputed favorite in South Carolina.",
      "author": "Haris Alic",
      "content": " A new CBS/YouGov survey released on Sunday confirmed as much, with the former vice president leading by nearly 30 percentage points in South Carolina.\u00a0Biden, who has led every single poll coming out of the Palmetto State since announcing his candidacy in April, commands 45 percent support among registered Democrats. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), who ranks higher than Biden in several national and early state polls, garnered second place with 17 percent. Her position, however, is extremely tenuous as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) is close behind in third place at 15 percent. South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) rounded out the top five in South Carolina at eight percent and five percent respectively. Biden\u2019s positions seemed to strike a chord with those polled, 59 percent of whom self-identified as somewhat liberal or moderate. When asked to describe the candidates by their qualities, 60 percent of South Carolina Democrats claimed Biden was \u201csafe,\u201d while 55 percent said the former vice president was \u201cdown to earth.\u201d\u00a0A further 71 percent believed Biden\u2019s policy stances were \u201cabout right for defeating [President] Donald Trump\u201d in 2020. Warren, meanwhile, despite being described as the most exciting candidate of the top three, was also seen as \u201crisky\u201d by 40 percent of South Carolina. Likewise, 42 percent of voters in the Palmetto state said the same thing about Sanders, a self-avowed Democrat socialist. The poll, which was conducted November 6 through November 13 by surveying 933 registered Democrats in South Carolina, had a margin of error of +/- 4.2 percentage points. Biden\u2019s commanding position in South Carolina is due in part to his support within the black community. In South Carolina, as across the entire South, black voters are a substantial portion of the Democrat electorate. A recent\u00a0survey\u00a0from Monmouth Poll estimated that\u00a0more than six-in-ten of South Carolina\u2019s likely Democrat primary voters will be black in 2020. Although the CBS/YouGov did not break down the candidates\u2019 level of support by race, a poll conducted by Winthrop University in October found Biden being the favorite of 46 percent of black Democrats\u00a0across South Carolina. Such support, which has remained in tact even after contentious revelations about the former vice president\u2019s position on race throughout the years, gives Biden an upper hand over his Democrat rivals as the primary contest is in flux. In recent weeks the Democrat primary has been upended by several high profile developments. Biden, who once led the field by double digits, has dropped to fourth place in Iowa and been eclipsed nationally by Warren since the start of the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry. In particular, Biden has seen his popularity dip amid revelations that his youngest son Hunter\u2019s wheeling and dealing overseas may have presented conflicts of interest for the former vice president\u2019s political position. Biden\u2019s faltering in the polls has coincided with fundraising troubles\u00a0that forced his campaign into jettisoning its pledge not to accept help from Super PACs. As Biden\u2019s campaign has struggled to remain viable, Buttigieg\u2019s momentum has begun soaring in Iowa. Several polls released from the state last week show the mayor has catapulted over Biden, Sanders, and Warren into first place. A Des Moines Register poll from Saturday had Buttigieg leading Warren, 25 percent to 16 percent. The mayor\u2019s newfound frontrunner status in Iowa opens up the possibility of a fractured race coming out of the early contests, provided Warren continues leading in New Hampshire and Biden remains atop in South Carolina. Shaking up the race further is the addition of more candidates, at the time when historically the field is supposed to winnow. Most notably, former Gov. Deval Patrick (D-MA), an intimate of President Barack Obama, announced his candidacy last week after having declined earlier entreaties to enter the race. Patrick, despite lacking national name recognition and a campaign apparatus, is seen as a prolific orator, with even Obama being known to occasionally lift lines from the governor\u2019s speeches. Another likely late\u00a0entrant is former New York City Michael Bloomberg, who has promised to spend \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to win the nomination. Although Bloomberg is still officially just mulling a bid, the former mayor\u2019s decision to file for the Alabama and Arkansas Democrat primaries, as well as a public mea culpa for stop-and-frisk, seem to imply he\u2019s already running. As both Bloomberg and Patrick are seen as establishment-friendly Democrats, their decisions to enter the 2020 race are likely to have the most impact on Biden. The former vice president has been viewed as the moderate alternative to progressive firebrands like Sanders and Warren. His success in the race to date has been because other candidates in the same lane have neither the resources nor the national attention to properly compete. It is unclear, though, if either Bloomberg or Patrick will present a credible threat to Biden given the fractured state of the 2020 field and the former vice president\u2019s position in South Carolina. When respondents in the CBS/YouGov survey were asked if Bloomberg\u2019s potential candidacy would have any impact on those they were already supporting, 36 percent said it would not, while 43 percent said they didn\u2019t know enough about him to answer. Since Patrick was not an announced candidate at the time the poll was taken, CBS/YouGov did not include him on its survey.",

They were based on moral, ethical, and policy differences. \u2026 To use your word. You said this was wrong. Not illegal, but wrong,\u201d he said, asking Vindman if he considered Biden\u2019s actions \u201cwrong\u201d as well. \u201cThere are dozens of corrupt nations in the world. Hundreds of corrupt government officials. Exactly one time did a vice president go to a nation and demand the specific firing of one individual and give a six-hour time limit and withhold or threaten to withhold a billion dollars in aid if not,\u201d Stewart said, referencing the video of Biden bragging\u00a0about his threat during an appearance at the\u00a0Council on Foreign Relations last year. \u201cIt was the one individual who was investigating a company who was paying his son. So I\u2019ll ask you, was that also wrong?\u201d Stewart asked. \u201cI frankly don\u2019t have any firsthand knowledge of that,\u201d Vindman began. \u201cDid you not see the video?\u201d Stewart asked. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the video,\u201d Vindman admitted. \u201cThat\u2019s all I\u2019ve described is the video. Everything I just said to you is in the video.

Once again, Vindman refused to describe Biden\u2019s action as \u201cwrong.\u201d \u201cI frankly don\u2019t know any \u2014 that much more about that particular incident,\u201d he said. \u201cI saw the snippet of the video, but I don\u2019t know if I could make a judgment off of that.\u201d The exchange centered around a video featuring Biden\u2019s braggadocious recount of threatening to withhold $1 billion in aid from Ukraine unless officials fired the prosecutor investigating Burisma, where Hunter Biden was making tens of thousands per month despite a stunning lack of qualifications for such a position on the board:  \u201cAnd so I got Ukraine. And I remember going over, convincing our team, our leaders to\u2014convincing that we should be providing for loan guarantees. And I went over, I guess, the 12th, 13th time to Kiev,\u201d Biden said on January 23, 2018. Biden continued: And I was supposed to announce that there was another billion-dollar loan guarantee. And I had gotten a commitment from Poroshenko and from Yatsenyuk that they would take action against the state prosecutor. And they didn\u2019t. So they said they had\u2014they were walking out to a press conference. I said, nah, I\u2019m not going to\u2014or, we\u2019re not going to give you the billion dollars.

I said, you\u2019re not getting the billion. I\u2019m going to be leaving here in, I think it was about six hours. I looked at them and said: I\u2019m leaving in six hours.

Trump and his allies, on the other hand, have claimed Hunter Biden\u2019s appointment, coming around the same time his father was tapped to lead Obama-era policy towards Ukraine, and his relative inexperience in the energy industry, warrant investigation. Vindman, who serves as the director of European affairs for the United States National Security Council, seemed to give credence to the president\u2019s concerns on Tuesday when appearing before Congress. \u201cAs far as I can tell he didn\u2019t seem to be [qualified],\u201d the lieutenant colonel said when asked about the younger Biden\u2019s role.  As Peter Schweizer, senior contributor at Breitbart News, detailed in his\u00a0book,\u00a0Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends, Hunter Biden had no prior experience with either the energy industry or Ukraine before joining Burisma in April 2014. In fact, his background in investment banking, lobbying, and hedge fund management paled in comparison to that of current and past members of the company\u2019s board of directors. Adding to concerns is the fact that, at the time Hunter Biden joined Burisma, the company was seen as actively courting western leaders to prevent further scrutiny of its business practices. The same month Hunter Biden was tapped for the group\u2019s board, the government of Great Britain\u00a0froze\u00a0accounts belonging to Zlochevsky under suspicion of money laundering. Zlochevsky, a former Ukrainian minister of natural resources, would later be accused of\u00a0corruption\u00a0for using his office to approve oil and gas licenses to companies under his control. A Ukrainian official with strong ties to Zlochevsky admitted in October the only reason that Hunter Biden secured the appointment was to \u201cprotect\u201d the company from foreign scrutiny. The claim has credence given that at the time, Joe Biden, as the sitting vice president, was tasked with leading the Obama administration\u2019s policy towards Ukraine in response to Russia\u2019s invasion of Crimea. It is in the context of Burisma and Zlochevsky\u2019s legal troubles that Joe Biden\u2019s political influence has raised the most red flags. The former vice president has particularly drawn questions over his conduct in demanding the Ukrainian government fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, in 2016. Joe Biden, who has publicly\u00a0bragged\u00a0about the firing, reportedly threatened to withhold more than one billion\u00a0dollars in U.S. aid if the Ukrainian government did not remove Shokin. He has claimed the demand came from then-President Barack Obama, who had allegedly lost faith in the prosecutor\u2019s ability to tackle corruption. Unofficially, though, it was known that Shokin was investigating both Burisma and Zlochevsky for public corruption. It is uncertain if the probe extended to Hunter Biden, although Shokin has recently admitted that prior to his ouster he was\u00a0warned\u00a0to back off the matter. Regardless of what occurred, Shokin\u2019s successor, who is now himself being\u00a0investigated\u00a0for public corruption,\u00a0dropped the investigation into Burisma and Zlochevsky. When asked about Biden orchestrating the pressure campaign on Ukraine to fire Shokin on Tuesday, Vindman refused to characterize\u00a0the former vice president\u2019s conduct as \u201cwrong.\u201d Vindman\u2019s refusal came despite the fact that another of the inquiry\u2019s star witnesses, former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, testified on Friday that Shokin\u2019s probe into Burisma was still open at the time of his dismissal. It wasn\u2019t an active case, but it also was not fully closed,\u201d Yovanovitc told lawmakers, before elaborating that at the time Shokin\u00a0was opting to keep a \u201chook\u201d into Burisma and Zlochevsky.",

      "author": "Edwin Mora",
      "content": " Volker\u2019s testimony once again undermined the quid pro quo claim contained in a \u201cwhistleblower\u2019s\u201d complaint that triggered the impeachment inquiry launched by House Democrats. GOP lawmakers have said Volker\u2019s October 3 deposition obliterated \u00a0the accusation against Trump at the center of the impeachment investigation and\u00a0\u201cexonerated\u201d him. Volker\u2019s October 3 deposition is consistent with his public testimony on Tuesday. The \u201cwhistleblower\u201d complaint accused Trump of abusing his power by leveraging U.S. aid during a July 25 call to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to launch an investigation into corruption allegations against the Bidens. Echoing his October 3 secret deposition almost verbatim on Tuesday, Volker testified alongside\u00a0former top European affairs official on Trump\u2019s National Security Council (NSC) Tim Morrison, the only two witnesses sought by the Republican minority and accepted by Democrats. At no time was I aware of or knowingly took part in an effort to urge Ukraine to investigate former Vice president Biden. As you know, from the extensive real-time documentation I have provided, Vice President Biden was not a topic of our discussions. I was not on the July 25 phone call between President Trump and President Zelensky. I was not made aware of any reference to Vice President Biden or his son by President Trump until the transcript of that call was released [by the White House] on September [24]. Volker provided \u201creal-time\u201d evidence in the forms of texts between U.S. State Department officials and Trump\u2019s private lawyer Rudy Giuliani. Characterizations by Democrats and impeachment witnesses, namely White House National Security (NSC) Director of European Affairs Lt. Col. Alexander\u00a0Vindman, allege that Trump \u201cdemanded\u201d that Ukraine investigate the Bidens. An unofficial transcript of the call released by the White House on September 24 shows that Trump urged Ukraine to carry out the investigation, without threatening to withhold aid if the country did not play ball. Volker and other current and former officials who testified, including U.S. diplomat Bill Taylor, deemed a \u201cstar witness\u201d by Democrats, acknowledged Ukraine did not even know the U.S. had frozen aid during the July 25 call, prompting Republicans to argue that a quid pro quo offer during the conversation would have been impossible at the time. You can\u2019t leverage an unknown to get something you want, which in this case would have been the investigations into the Bidens. \u201cI don\u2019t think\u201d Ukraine was \u201caware\u201d that U.S. aid was being withheld \u201cat the time\u201d of the call, \u201cso there was no leverage implied,\u201d Volker proclaimed during his October 3 deposition. The Trump administration ended up releasing the aid on September 11 without Ukraine having to launch investigations into the Bidens or possible interference in the 2016 U.S. elections or even participating in a meeting. Despite allegations to the contrary, Zelensky testified Tuesday that the Trump-Zelensky meeting was \u201cnot conditioned\u201d on Ukraine carrying out the so-called investigation into White House hopeful and Trump\u2019s political rival Biden. Trump, Zelensky, Volker, and other impeachment probe witnesses denied the existence of the quid pro quo allegations contained in the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d complaint and alleged by some impeachment witnesses, citing hearsay. On October 3, Volker explicitly denied that he \u201cdidn\u2019t think\u201d there was a quid pro quo during the July 25 call. Volker did not participate in the call and did not even know when it was going to take place. Democrats and their mainstream media allies attempted to paint Volker as a significant player in helping Trump push for so-called political investigations in return for aid, although he denied any involvement. On Tuesday, Volker made it clear that, unlike him, some of his colleagues did not see a distinction between an investigation into the Ukrainian company that hired Hunter Biden from 2014 to April of this year and the Bidens. Some U.S. officials and Democrats conflated the two, a move that benefited their impeachment agenda. Volker defended former VP Biden against corruption allegations, saying he is an honorable man. His defense of Biden on Tuesday and October 3 suggested he was not pushing for any investigation of the Bidens. The Democrat-led House Committees on Oversight and Reform, Intelligence, and Foreign Affairs are leading the impeachment inquiry. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA), the chief impeachment inquisitor, is hosting the public hearings, of which more are expected this week.",

      "author": "Edwin Mora",
      "content": " Nunes, the top ranking Republican on the House intel panel, accused Democrats of waging a \u201cscorched earth political warfare on the other party\u201d during his opening remarks, adding: The Democrats have exploited the intelligence committee for political purposes for three years culminating in these impeachment herrings and their mania to attack the president. No conspiracy theory is too outlandish for the Democrats. \u2026 Clearly, these ludicrous accusations don\u2019t reflect committee members who are honestly searching for the truth. They\u2019re the actions of partisan extremists who hijacked the intelligence committee, transformed it into the impeachment committee, abandoned its oversight functions, and turned it into a beachhead for ousting an elected president from office. His comments came during the public hearing during which U.S. ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland is expected to testify. There has been friction between Trump and the intelligence community since the Russia collusion hoax began, prompting allegations that there could be plenty of \u201cdeep state\u201d agents within the intel agencies. The allegedly partisan \u201cwhistleblower\u201d who sparked the impeachment inquiry hailed from the intelligence community. Nunes proclaimed during the hearing: The Democrats have zeroed in on an anonymous whistleblower complaint that was cooked up in cooperation with the Democrats on this very committee. They lied to the American people about that cooperation and refused to let us question the whistleblower and discover the truth. Meanwhile, the Democrats lash out to anyone who questions or lashes out on this [impeachment] spectacle. When Ukrainian President [Volodymyr] Zelensky denies that anything wrong happened on that [July 25] phone call, the Democrats call him a liar. When journalists report Ukraine election meddling and [former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son] Hunter Biden\u2019s position on the board of corrupt Ukrainian companies, the Democrats label them conspiracy theorists. When the Democrats can\u2019t get any traction for their allegations of quid pro quo, they move the goal post and accuse the president of extortion, the bribery, and at last resort obstruction of justice. During their public hearing on Tuesday, former National Security Council (NSC) Russia expert Tim Morrison and former U.S. Special Envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker denied that any extortion or bribery had taken place during Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine. The \u201cwhistleblower\u201d complaint that triggered the impeachment probe accuses Trump of abusing his power by pressuring Zelensky during a July 25 call to investigate corruption allegations against Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Trump, Zelensky, Volker, and other impeachment inquiry witnesses have denied the allegations. Other witnesses, however, have presumed that a quid pro quo did take place during the July 25 call. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA), the lead impeachment inquisitor, lied about meeting with the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d before he filed the complaint, a move that has raised concerns of coordination. Some news outlets have described the leaker as an anti-Trump partisan. The \u201cwhistleblower\u201d may have broken the law by meeting with Schiff and/or his staff. Some impeachment probe witnesses have said there are merits to corruption allegations linked to Hunter Biden, suggesting that Trump was right to ask for an investigation from Ukraine. Combating corruption in Ukraine is a significant component of U.S. policy. Hunter worked for allegedly corrupt Ukrainian company Burisma from 2014 to April of this year. At the time that Burisma hired him, former VP Biden was spearheading U.S. policy towards Ukraine. Biden pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor who had investigated the Burisma owner, prompting accusations of corruption. The Obama administration knew Burisma and its owner were corrupt but allowed Hunter to work there anyway.",

      "subtitle": "The House Intelligence Committee is expected to hear from Laura Cooper, the top Pentagon official overseeing U.S. policy towards Russia, Ukraine, and Eurasia, during an open hearing Wednesday afternoon.",
      "author": "Edwin Mora",
      "content": " She testified behind closed doors on October 23 despite the Pentagon saying it would not comply with the impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump. Cooper mainly focused on the Trump administration\u2019s decision to withhold the Congressionally-approved assistance to Ukraine despite the Pentagon\u2019s recommendation that the U.S. distribute it. House Democrats pursuing the impeachment probe are trying to determine if Trump abused his power by allegedly pressuring Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, in exchange for unfreezing the aid. Lawmakers will potentially question Cooper about what she knew about the holdup of military aid to Ukraine, and whether that decision was part of a scheme to pressure the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during a July 25 call into launching investigations that would have benefitted Trump politically. On September 11, the U.S. released the aid to Ukraine without having to do anything in return as part of a quid pro quo alleged in a \u201cwhistleblower\u201d complaint that triggered the impeachment probe. Key Democrat Talking Points Dozens of Republicans who were not part of the House panels conducting the probe famously interrupted the closed-door meeting in the basement of the capitol in protest to being excluded from the meeting. Democrats will likely try to play that up to make it seem they were trying to prevent Cooper from criticizing Trump. Cooper testified on October 23 that during a July meeting, many in the administration raised concerns that Trump may have lacked the legal authority to freeze aid after Congress had approved it.\u00a0She told House investigators that Trump had to notify Congress of the hold on aid. \u201cSo the comments in the room at the deputies\u2019 level reflected a sense that there was not an understanding of how this could legally play out,\u201d Cooper testified behind closed doors. \u201cAnd at that meeting, the deputies agreed to look into the legalities and to look at what was possible.\u201d Cooper described Trump\u2019s decision to hold aid as \u201cunusual\u201d during her closed-door deposition, noting that Ukraine was at war with Russia. Democrats will try to focus on Cooper\u2019s knowledge of discussions among various federal agencies about freezing the aid to Ukraine. They will try to grill her on answering who, exactly, directed that the U.S. withhold the security assistance and whether it was leveraged to pressure Ukraine to launch investigations into the Bidens. Cooper suggested she had a \u201cvery strong inference\u201d that the Ukrainians knew there was a hold on U.S. funding as of August 20, after the July 25 call between Trump and Zelensky at the heart of the impeachment probe. Democrats and their media allies claim that undercuts a vital defense of Trump: that there could be no quid pro quo because Ukraine did not know that the U.S. had withheld aid. Cooper\u2019s comments, however, suggest that Ukraine did not know the U.S. had frozen the aid at the time of the July 25 call, suggesting that there could be no quid pro quo during that conversation. What the Democrats Don\u2019t Want You to Hear Trump held the aid to Ukraine over corruption concerns. Combating corruption in Ukraine is a significant component of U.S. policy. Several impeachment inquiry witnesses have testified that there were merits to the corruption investigations into the company that hired Hunter Biden sought by Trump. While several impeachment witnesses have been dismayed by the decision to hold aid, the U.S. ultimately released the security without Ukraine doing anything in return. Democrats are trying to move beyond the quid pro quo narrative, claiming Trump engaged in extortion and bribing, but witnesses have denied the new allegation. Unlike his predecessor, Trump approved lethal aid to Ukraine to help them in their fight against Russia. On Wednesday, Intelligence Committee ranking member Rep. Devin Nunes (D-CA) noted that Democrats had not released the transcript of the closed-door deposition Saturday of White House Office of Management and Budget Mark Sandy, who told Congress the real reason the aid had ben withheld. Cooper, officially the deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia, Ukraine, and Eurasia testified last month that her role primarily focuses on the Pentagon\u2019s long-term strategy and current policy toward Russia. Regarding Ukraine, she mainly focused her work on fostering a strong relationship with the country\u2019s Defense Ministry and \u201cbuilding the capacity of the Ukrainian Armed Forces to resist Russian aggression.\u201d Trump\u2019s lethal assistance likely helped build that capacity. The Democrat-led House Intelligence Committee, one of three panels conducting the impeachment inquiry, is hosting the public hearings.",

      "content": " For the first time, President Trump\u00a0is taking the lead ahead of four top Democrat candidates in potential head to head match-ups, according to a Wednesday poll conducted by\u00a0Marquette University Law School. According to the survey, only 40 percent of registered voters in\u00a0Wisconsin believe that President Trump should be impeached and removed from office. That percentage has dropped since last month, when 44 percent answered that the president should be impeached and removed. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how this story is going to end,\u201d said Marquette Poll director Charles Franklin. \u201cAt the moment just over half think there was an ask.\u201d It was also noted that in October \u2014 before the public\u00a0testimony began \u2014 the Marquette poll showed that among the respondents who said the president should be impeached, only 44 percent said that Trump should be removed from office, with 51 percent saying that he should not be removed. When it comes to the head to head match-ups, the president led former vice president Joe Biden by 47 percent to 44 percent (within the\u00a0margin of error), which turns the tables from August\u2019s survey results that\u00a0 showed Biden leading Trump by 51 percent to 42 percent. As for the other top Democrat candidates, Trump led Sen.\u00a0Bernie Sanders (D-VT) by 48 percent to 45 percent, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) by\u00a048 percent to 43 percent, and South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg by 47 percent to 39 percent. \u201cCall it a small advantage to Trump,\u201d said Franklin. The survey also revealed that 52 percent of respondents believe President Trump asked Ukrainian President Zelensky to investigate his political rival, with 29 percent answering that he did not. Among those polled, 41 percent also said that they think President Trump withheld military aid to pressure\u00a0Zelensky, with 38 percent saying he did not. With regards to whether or not the president\u2019s alleged behavior had been erroneous, 42 percent thought President Trump did something seriously wrong, nine percent thought he did something wrong, and 38 percent believe that the president did not do something wrong. The poll was reportedly conducted using answers from 801 registered Wisconsin voters, and was taken through November 13 to 17, with the margin of error for the full sample being plus or minus 4.1 percent.

      "author": "Haris Alic",
      "content": " \u201cI\u2019m leaving the fifth Democratic debate now,\u201d the former vice president wrote supporters. \u201cI hope I made you proud out there and I hope I made it clear to the world why our campaign is so important.\u201d Biden proceeds in the rest of the email to highlight his \u201cability to reach across the aisle,\u201d before ultimately ending with an appeal for political contributions for his campaign. Some members of the media, like Jess Bidgood of The Boston Globe, speculated that Biden\u2019s appeal to bipartisanship in the email may indicate he plans to focus his attacks on Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) during Wednesday\u2019s debate.  Warren, until the recent rise of South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, has been seen as Biden\u2019s biggest rival for the Democrat nomination. As such, the two have sparred openly over the direction of the Democrat Party. Biden, who claims to be the only Democrat able to win back the white working class in 2020, is campaigning as something of a moderate who will bring forth incremental change. The strategy is evident in the former vice president\u2019s policy platform, which is full of ideas that were seen as too radical during the Obama years but are now considered tepid when compared to those advocated by progressives like Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY). Warren, on the other hand, is a proponent of radical change, as exhibited by her endorsements of a wealth tax and the Green New Deal. The differences between the two have been evident in their recent back and forth on Medicare for All. Biden, who opposes the universal healthcare plan in favor of expanding the Affordable Care Act through a public option, has accused Warren and other supporters of Medicare for All of being dishonest. In particular, the former vice president has claimed Warren is lying about the true costs of Medicare for All and how she plans to fund the program. \u201cShe\u2019s making it up,\u201d the former vice president\u00a0told\u00a0PBS News Hour earlier this month\u00a0when asked about cost estimates Warren\u2019s campaign had released on the proposal: Look, nobody thinks it\u2019s $20 trillion. It\u2019s between 30 and $40 trillion. Every major independent study that\u2019s gone out there, that\u2019s taken a look at this, there is no way \u2014 even [Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT)], who talks about the need to raise middle-class taxes, he can\u2019t even meet the cost of it. Warren has responded to such attacks by suggesting Biden was \u201crunning in the wrong presidential primary.\u201d",

      "author": "John Binder",
      "content": " The latest Harvard/Harris Poll reveals that about six-in-ten U.S. voters said they are more likely to support 2020 presidential candidates who vow to strengthen the southern border \u201cto reduce illegal immigrants,\u201d among other things. Only about four-in-ten U.S. voters said they are more likely to vote for presidential candidates who promise to\u00a0open \u201cour borders to many more immigrants,\u201d as all leading 2020 Democrat presidential primary candidates have promised to do. As Breitbart News has noted, former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) have similar immigration plans \u2014 all designed to open the U.S.-Mexico border to more illegal immigration, provide big business with an endless flow of cheaper foreign labor, and increase foreign competition against America\u2019s working and middle class with increased legal immigration levels. Across all issues facing the nation, U.S. votes continue to say that health care and immigration remain the two most important problems in the upcoming 2020 election. For years, Trump has committed to reducing overall immigration to the country to boost wages and decrease labor market pressures for American workers. While Trump\u2019s \u201cBuy American, Hire American\u201d economy has resulted in record employment for nearly all demographic groups, there remains about 11.5 million Americans who are either unemployed, underemployed, or out of the labor market but all of whom want good-paying full-time employment.  Extensive research by economists like George Borjas and analyst Steven Camarota has found that the country\u2019s current legal immigration system \u2014 wherein 1.2 million mostly low-skilled workers are admitted annually \u2014 burdens U.S. taxpayers and America\u2019s working and middle class while redistributing about $500 billion\u00a0in wealth every year to major employers and newly arrived immigrants. Camarota, director of research for the Center for Immigration Studies, has found that every one-percent increase in the immigrant composition of American workers\u2019 occupations reduces their weekly wages by about 0.5 percent. This means the average native-born American worker today has his weekly wages reduced by perhaps 8.5 percent because of current legal immigration levels. Every year, the U.S. admits about 1.2 million legal immigrants with the overwhelming majority, nearly 70 percent, coming through the process known as \u201cchain migration,\u201d whereby newly naturalized citizens are allowed to bring an unlimited number of foreign nationals to the country. The mass inflow of legal immigrants is in addition to the hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens who are added to the U.S. population annually. John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

      "content": " MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow and Andrea Mitchell will moderate the debate with NBC\u2019s Kristen Wekler and the Washington Post\u2019s Ashley Parker. Stay tuned to Breitbart News for live updates. All times eastern. Debate begins at 9 PM ET.  11:50 PM: Warren just not appealing to people like Peter Gammons\u2026. and David Gergen:  11:39 PM: MSNBC\u2019s Lawrence O\u2019Donnell says Biden\u2019s screw up re: Harris/Moseley Braun was unlike anything he has ever seen in a debate because he forgot that Harris existed. He said Biden had a great debate up until that point and said that gaffe was as bad as it could have gotten for the former vice president. 11:30 PM:  11:03 PM: Closing statements start. Booker says he has not qualified for the next debate and needs help. Booker says he saw John Lewis in the audience and says he is literally on the stage because a lawyer who decided to represent families who were discriminated against. \u00a0He says the lawyer told him he did so because he saw John Lewis being beaten by state trooper in Alabama. Booker says we have a \u201cmoral moment\u201d right now like in 1965 and he will cause, quoting John Lewis, \u201cgood trouble.\u201d He asks Americans to keep him on the stage. Steyer says everyone is more patriotic than the \u201ccriminal in the White House.\u201d He says he is different than everyone on stage because he knows government has been purchased by corporations and has spent a decade building coalitions to defeat those corporations. He says he is the only person talking about term limits. He says he has built international businesses and he is the only person who can say that \u201cMr. Trump\u201d is a fraud in his business dealings. He is making the electability argument. Gabbard talks about how everyone needs to be treated with respect\u2013 \u201cAloha\u201d values of inclusion, respect. She says Dr. Martin Luther King visited Hawaii in 1959 and expressed his appreciation for the \u201cAloha spirit\u201d when it comes to racial justice. Gabbard said King said he saw the face of the future in Hawaii and says \u201clet\u2019s make Dr. King\u2019s dream a reality.\u201d\n\nYang says he is here with his wife and two kids. He says our children are not all right right now because of all of the economic disruptions, etc. Yang said he did not want to run for president but the people in Washington DC did not want to talk about issues like automation they did not understand and did not have solutions for. He says he is not running for president because he fantasized about running for president. He says he is running for president because he is a parent and patriot and sees the future and will not accept what he sees right now. Klobuchar says the election is about economics but it is also about patriotism and decency. She says people turned out in Virginia, Kentucky and says Democrats must also appeal to moderates who can\u2019t stomach Donald Trump. She again seems very jittery. Harris says we\u2019re in a fight for our rule of law, for our democracy, and for our system of justice. She says to fight this fight, Democrats must have the ability to go toe to toe with Donald Trump. She says she has taken on Sessions, Barr, Kavanaugh. She says she has never represented a corporation or special interests\u2026 she says justice (economic, reproductive, education) is on the ballot and America\u2019s promise will be unlocked if we overcome these injustices. Buttigieg talks about former Atlanta Mayor Maynard Jackson and how he helped create the black middle class. He says he is not only running to beat Donald Trump but to also lead the era that comes after Trump. He says that era must be one of inclusion. He says he is inviting progressives, moderates, and future former Republicans to joint the movement he is building. Sanders says he is the son of an immigrant and stands with the undocumented immigrants. Says he spent a night in jail in the 1970s after protesting. He says he has received more campaign contributions at this point than any candidate in history. Warren says she hears a lot of great ideas. She says the majority of Americans are with Democrats on issues but corruption prevents issues from being solved. She says drug companies and big corporations benefits and talks about her anti-corruption plan. Biden says he hopes Warren wasn\u2019t talking about the \u201cspotless\u201d Obama administration when she was talking about corruption. Biden says we have the most productive workers and we are led by the power of our example. He says he is tired of people with the \u201cwoe is me\u201d attitude and repeats his stump speech. He talks about getting up and taking back the country: \u201cGet up and take it back.\u201d 11:02 PM: Steyer now talking about his Next Gen organization\u2019s ability to turn out voters in the 2020 so Democrats can have a \u201csweeping victory.\u201d 10:58 PM: Gabbard says Buttigieg\u2019s service is not enough for him to be Commander-in-Chief. Rips him for his \u201cinexperience\u201d and cites his recent \u201ccareless statement\u201d about how he would be sending troops to Mexico to fight to cartels. Buttigieg says his statement was taken out of context and was talking about U.S.-Mexico cooperation. He now rips Gabbard for sitting down with a \u201cmurderous dictator like that\u201d (Assad). Gabbard says Buttigieg was asked if he would send troops to fight cartels and his answer was yes. Gabbard, responding to Assad criticisms, says Kennedy met with Kruschev, Reagan-Gorbachev. 10:57 PM: Buttigieg and Klobuchar spar over \u201cWashington experience\u201d after candidates discuss voting rights issues. He says there is over 100 years of Washington experience on the stage right now and asks where has that gotten us. 10:51 PM: Warren says abortion is a \u201chuman right\u201d and an \u201ceconomic right\u201d when asked if there is a room for a person like pro-life Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards, who just won re-election. She punts and when asked if there is room for someone like Edwards, she says she is not here to drive anyone out of the party. Sanders says this is the moment when men must stand up with women on abortion. Sanders says he is tired of conservatives who want government off the backs of Americans and don\u2019t understand that women, and not politicians, control their own bodies. 10:49 PM: Debate now turns to abortion. Klobuchar says we should \u201ccodify Roe v. Wade into law.\u201d She rips Trump for having said women and then doctors should go to jail. She says abortion will be a big issue in the general election. 10:42 PM: Booker rips Biden for not wanting to legalize marijuana at the federal level and he wondered if \u201che was high\u201d when he said it. Booker says marijuana is already legalize for the privileged. He says there are more African-Americans in prisons than slaves in 1850. Booker says Democrats need a candidate who will inspire black voters. But Booker and Harris aren\u2019t those candidates. Biden says marijuana should be decriminalized. \u201cEveryone gets out, records expunged,\u201d Biden says. Biden says he \u201ccomes out of the black community\u201d in terms of support and cites his endorsements from African American elected officials. Biden, talking about former Seantor Moseley Braun, says he has the support of the only African-American woman ever elected to the Senate. Harris jumps in and says: \u201cNope\u2026 The other one\u2019s here.\u201d  10: 41 PM: Warren asked if she will use taxpayer money to take down parts of the border wall because she called the wall a monument to hate. Warren gives a confusing answer about taking parts down if they are not necessary and quickly shifts to children being caged in Amazon-like warehouses. 10:39 PM: Warren talking about student loan debt as an \u201ceconomic justice\u201d issue. She says black students are more likely to borrow money and more likely to be indebted. She says that is why everyone on the stage needs to embrace student loan forgiveness because it will \u201cclose the black-white\u201d income gap. 10:36 PM: Buttigieg says he his faith teaches him to care about those who are marginalized in society. He says though he does not have the experience of being a person of color, he sometimes has felt that he was a stranger in his own country. 10:35 PM: Harris given a chance to rip Buttigieg for his lack of support from black voters and she punts. Harris says Democrats for too long have taken black voters for granted. She says at some point, people get tired of being thanked for showing up and want politicians to show up for them. 10:32 PM: Biden asked about #MeToo. He says \u201cwe have to fundamentally change the culture\u201d re: how women are treated. He talks about the \u201cit\u2019s on us\u201d movement on college campuses that he help to spearhead to change the culture. Biden says no man has the right hit a women unless it is for self defense, which is rare. He then says we have to combat women\u2019s issues by keep \u201cpunching at it.\u201d 10:30 PM: Yang says white supremacist groups should be labelled as terrorist organizations so the federal government could get better data. Yang says we need to reach out boys who are susceptible to hate groups before they lose their way. 10:29 PM: Debate now turns to race. Candidates asked what they would do about white supremacism. Gabbard says leadership starts at the top and we \u201cset the record straight\u201d and correct the racial injustices that continue to exist. She says the war on drugs has disproportionately impacted people of color and the poor. She wants sentencing reforms and reforms to the money-bail system. 10: 23 PM: Warren, when asked about military issues, says she wants a force of 10,000 people to take care of and maintain national parks. 10:21 PM: Sanders says Saudi Arabia is not a reliable ally. He says we have to bring Iran and Saudi Arabia together in a room and tell them the country is tired of spending billions because of their problems. He says the same goes for Israel-Palestinians. He says we need to be rethinking who are allies are around the world. Says he is pro-Israel but \u201cit is no longer good enough for us to be simply pro-Israel.\u201d He says America must treat Palestinians with \u201crespect.\u201d 10:18 PM: Biden, when asked about Saudi Arabia, says the Crown Prince should be punished and held accountable for\u00a0Khashoggi\u2019s murder. He says Saudi Arabia should be sold weapons and should be made a pariah. Klobuchar says China is in it for the long game and we need a president who has a long-term strategy on China. 10:17 PM: Booker rips Trump\u2019s \u201ctransactional\u201d foreign policy. He says Trump\u2019s scorecard on China is not good since it has become more authoritarian under Trump. He wants to check Putin, China and other countries trying undermine democracy. 10:15 PM: Yang says what he would say to Putin during their first phone call if he wins the White House. Yang says he will say he is sorry that \u201cI beat your guy.\u201d He will also tell him the the days of meddling in America\u2019s elections are over. Yang says he will tell him he will strengthen NATO. He says he will propose a new world data organization\u2013like the WTO for data. Yang also calls out China for human rights abuses. 10:12 PM: Sanders asked if he would cut a deal with the Taliban. Sanders takes the opening to say one of the differences between himself and Biden is that Biden supported the \u201cterrible war in Iraq\u201d while he voted against it. Sanders says we have to rethink the war on terror and if it necessary to cut a deal with the Taliban, he will do so. 10:10 PM: Mitchell asks Biden what he would do re: North Korea that Obama did not do in his eight years. Biden says that Kim Jong Un says he was a rabid dog that needed to be beaten with a stick. Biden says America needs to make clear to China that the country will move up its defenses and if they \u201cview that as a threat, it\u2019s an easy thing to respond to\u201d by putting pressure on North Korea. He says Trump has no idea what he\u2019s re: Korea. 10:09 PM: Mitchell asks Harris about North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un and nuclear concessions. Harris uses the question to say:\u00a0\u201cDonald Trump got punked.\u201d 10:07 PM: Sanders, taking a page out of AOC\u2019s playbook, says we don\u2019t have decades to solve the climate change problem. He says \u201cclimate refugees\u201d will cause national security problems all over the world. He says the fossil fuel industry is \u201ccriminally liable\u201d for lying about climate change and \u201cmaybe we should prosecute them as well.\u201d 10:03 PM: Maddow tees up a climate change question for Steyer. He says he is the only person on stage who will say climate is the number one priority. He says Biden won\u2019t say it. Warren won\u2019t say it. He says he will declare a \u201cstate of emergency\u201d and use the emergency powers of the presidency to combat climate change. He says it should be the top priority in his foreign policy. Biden says climate change is \u201cthe existential threat to humanity.\u201d He says he doesn\u2019t need a \u201clecture from my friend\u201d on climate change issues. He now talks more gobbledygook and says Steyer was producing coal around the world than \u201call of Great Britain produces\u201d while he was passing climate legislation. Steyer says everyone needs to come to the same conclusion he did over a decade ago on climate. 10:02 PM: Gabbard talks about transitioning the country off of fossil fuels and ending the billions in subsidies given to the fossil fuel industry re: environmental threats. 10:01 PM: Buttigieg, asked if he would continue Trump\u2019s farm subsidies, says he has heard from many farmers that the subsidies are not making them whole. He rips Trump\u2019s \u201ctrade war\u201d that never should have been started. He talks about small refinery wavers that hurt ethanol producers. A very smart answer to appeal to Iowans. 9:54 PM: Booker now talks about gentrification and his ideas to use the tax law to empower renters as much as homeowners (mortgage interest deduction). 9:53 PM:\u00a0Warren says housing is how people build wealth and says the federal government has favored white people over blacks (redlining) and that still needs to be addressed. 9:50 PM: Julian Castro, who is not on the stage, said Democrats should talk about housing tonight. Welker asks Steyer why he is the best person to solve the housing crisis. Was he the best person to get this question? C\u2019mon. Steyer says resources need to be applied to build millions of units that are sustainable because it has a direct impact on climate. 9:46 PM: Klobuchar (proposing three months of paid family leave) and Harris (proposing six months) asked to explain their plans. Klobuchar says it is important that you pay for your plans because Trump lies and increases the debt while treating farmers and workers like \u201cpoker chips\u201d in a casino. She says Democrats have an obligation as a party to be fiscally responsible. Harris, when asked about her plan, tells people to go to her website to read all of her plans. She says it is no longer the case that people are not having children in their 20s. She says people are having kids in their 30s and 40s and they are now raising their kids and taking care of their aging parents. She says the burden falls on women to do that work and they have to make a difficult choice re: leaving good-paying jobs. She says six months is necessary for the reality of today. Liberal Democrats are going to love Harris\u2019s answer and was probably her best moment on policy in all of the debates. 9:45: Yang calls for paid family leave. He says the U.S. should not be on a list with Papua New Guinea (countries without paid family leave policies.) Yang takes the opportunity to tout his freedom dividend proposal that will allow families to pay for childcare or stay at home to raise their kids. 9:43 PM: Biden says Democrats should not say \u201clock him up\u201d because \u201cit\u2019s about civility\u201d and we need to restore the soul of the country. Sanders says more Americans are believing that Trump is in violation of the law after watching the impeachment hearings. Biden says Trump has \u201cindicted himself.\u201d Biden says there are two questions\u2013whether he should be impeached and removed and whether he should be prosecuted after he leaves office. He says the latter is a question for an attorney general. 9:41 PM: Maddow notes that people are now chanting \u201clock him up\u201d at the World Series and campaign events. She says that chant has been heard at two of Sanders\u2019 rallies and Maddow asks if Democrats should be okay with that. Sanders says nobody is above the law and if he did break the law, he should be prosecuted. 9:40 PM: Booker is asked if Trump communicated with Americans and tweeting all of his thoughts is a norm that should have been broken. Booker says Trump demeans and degrades the nation. A bizarre question that seemed to set up Booker to highlight that he used Twitter to communicated to citizens well before Trump but Booker whiffed. 9:39 PM: Biden basically says he will be a good president because he knows the names of all of the world\u2019s leaders. Sounds very establishment. 9:35 PM: Mitchell asks what Klobuchar meant when she implied Buttigieg would not be on the stage if he were a female. She says woman, though, are held to a higher standard and if not we would be able to play the game of naming our favorite female president. Klobuchar says she has passed over 100 bills and frames herself a consensus builder. It\u2019s misleading because she passes a lot of small bills that are often impossible not to get a consensus. Of course, moderators don\u2019t call her out on that. What huge bill is Klobuchar associated with? 9:33 PM: Buttigieg claims he has the right experience to take on Donald Trump. He says he \u201ccomes from the kind of communities\u201d that Trump claims he is helping. He says Trump claims to help people while traveling on private jets between golf courses. 9:32 PM: Yang finally gets a question. Parker says Yang has never served in the government and military and asks how he will be able to respond to terrorist attacks. Yang first praises Steyer for using his billions to fight climate change and says he should not criticized for doing so. Steyer replies: \u201cThank you, Andrew.\u201d Yang has says the next Commander-in-Chief should be focused on the threats of tomorrow. A good frame because Yang\u2019s whole campaign theme is that today\u2019s politician don\u2019t understand threat of the future like AI, etc. 9:31 PM: Klobuchar, contrasting herself with Steyer, says 9:30 PM: Worth noting that Yang is the only person who has not gotten a question. Bad form for MSNBC after a year of very strange omissions that has prompted even fairly neutral observers to call out the network:  9:29 PM: Steyer gets a question. He talks about a broken government that is purchased by corporations. He says he has taken on a defeated tobacco companies, utilities, drug companies, etc. Will MSNBC ask him about his private equity deals? 9:25 PM: Gabbard is asked about what the \u201crot\u201d she she\u2019s in the Democratic party. Gabbard says the party continues to be influenced by the \u201cforeign policy establishment\u201d in Washington that Clinton represents along with the military industrial complex. She slams the Bush-Clinton-Trump foreign policy doctrine. Interesting omission of Obama. Gabbard says as president she will end the regime-change wars and the new cold war. Harris is asked to respond and she says \u201cit\u2019s unfortunate that we have someone on this stage\u201d who wants to be the party\u2019s nominee who spent years on Fox News criticizing Obama and \u201cbuddying up to Steve Bannon.\u201d Harris is months late on this comeback\u2013and it shows how unprepared she and her team were when Gabbard telegraphed her attacks against Harris a couple weeks ago. A day late and a dollar short. 9:22 PM: Welker asks Sanders if Obama is right when he said Americans don\u2019t want to tear the system down. Sanders says he isn\u2019t and then talks about a health care system that is \u201ccruel and dysfunctional.\u201d He says \u201csome of the people up here\u201d think should not take on the insurance and pharmaceutical industries. He\u2019s talking about Mayor Pete and Biden and maybe Booker. But he doesn\u2019t mention them by name. Dunce moderators do not ask Sanders which candidates he is talking about. Piss poor job of following up by this team so far. Out to lunch. 9:20 PM: Warren defends he Medicare for all plan. She says when people have had a chance to \u201cfeel it\u201d and \u201ctaste it\u201d after the third year, people are going to want it. Sanders, when finally brought into the discussion, says: \u201cThank you, I wrote the damn bill.\u201d 9:18 PM: Buttigieg says we are in a different environment than when Obama was president and claims that Democrats now have a majority on issues like guns and immigration if they can \u201cgalvanize\u201d and not \u201cpolarize.\u201d He pitches his \u201cMedicare for all who want it\u201d plan and says Democrats should not be \u201ccommanding\u201d people to get Medicare. 9:14 PM: After Warren pitches her \u201ctwo cents\u201d wealth tax, Booker, backed by Wall Street, says he is for increasing the estate tax and does not agree with Warren\u2019s wealth tax. Booker says he wants a more just tax system and says the country needs to give more people opportunities to grow wealth. Booker, at the very end of the stage, gets a question before other candidates like Yang and Gabbard. It seems like MSNBC is trying its best to make Booker seem like the \u201cmoderate\u201d candidate Democrats should back. But there is a reason he is at the end of the stage. Warren says she is \u201ctired of freeloading billionaires\u201d and repeats her stump speech about everything a two-cent wealth tax can help accomplish. 9:11 PM: Harris is next and she says \u201cwe have a criminal in the White House.\u201d Harris is just a talking-point machine, re-upping some of her best anti-Trump lines from the trail. 9:08 PM: Mitchell asks Biden a good question. She mentions Biden has claimed Republicans will work again with Democrats if he becomes president. She asks how that will be possible when Republicans want him and his son investigated. \u201cDonald Trump doesn\u2019t want me to be the nominee,\u201d Biden says, adding that he also found out Putin doesn\u2019t want him to be president from the hearings. Biden keeps stressing that he is the best person to beat Trump but never answers Mitchell\u2019s question. Mitchell doesn\u2019t follow up and lets Biden slide. Expect someone like Sanders to whack Biden on this later if given an opportunity. 9:07 PM: Buttigieg, asked the same question, says Trump\u2019s conduct should be central and claims Trump has already confessed his crimes on television. He says he will confront Trump for his wrongdoings but says he is also running to govern after Trump. He says when Trump is defeated, it will be a \u201ctender\u201d moment in a country when the sun will come up. He says the country will be more divided than ever and big issues still need to be addressed. 9:06 PM: Sanders says Trump is a \u201cpathological liar\u201d who is the \u201cmost corrupt president\u201d in modern history when asked how central Trump\u2019s conduct should be in the campaign. Sanders, stealing a bit from Yang, says Democrats cannot be consumed with Trump or they will lose the election. He says the American people understand that Congress can \u201cwalk and chew bubble gum at the same time\u201d by dealing with Trump\u2019s corruption and standing up for working families and fighting the corrupt political system and the \u201crigged economy.\u201d 9:04 PM: For some reason, Klobuchar is now given air time. She says she is for an impeachment inquiry but the jury is still out on the evidence. Won\u2019t commit to convicting and removing Trump like Warren. Klobuchar seems a bit jittery. 9:02 PM: Maddow begins with an impeachment question. Maddow asks Warren if she is willing to convince her Republican colleagues to convict Trump. What a softball question. Warren says of course. Warren now segues to money in politics, putting her against Democrats backed by big-money donors like Biden without mentioning anyone. Warren says ambassadorships should not be for sale. 9:00 PM: All candidates on stage as the debate is about to get started. Mitchell says they will cover a lot of topics, including \u201cnational security, race, and climate.\u201d 8:50 PM: Candidates about to take the stage. Chris Matthews says the impeachment hearings have shown that the Democrats are simply, more than anything, an \u201canti-Trump\u201d party. He says Democrats are more interested in bringing Trump down than they are about any of the presidential candidates and their platforms. 8:45 PM: A late entry into the race who obviously did not qualify for the debate:  8:39 PM:\u00a0Can Mayor Pete take the heat tonight? Will his poll numbers hold after tonight\u2019s debate?   Yang creates an all-female playlist featuring a Taylor Swift album on the day Ariana Grande, a Scooter Braun client, expressed her support for Bernie Sanders.  Ariana Grande for Bernie:  Creative fundraising pitch from Yang\u2019s campaign:  Candidates will be debate on the Oprah Winfrey soundstage. Media in the Whoopi Goldberg Soundstage.  ",

      "subtitle": "WASHINGTON, DC \u2014 Former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Jeffrey Piatt in 2015 joined three impeachment probe witnesses in calling for an investigation into the corruption-linked Burisma company and its owner while then Vice-President\u2019s Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, was working at the Ukrainian company.",
      "author": "Edwin Mora",
      "content": " Piatt [or Pyatt], who preceded former U.S. Ukraine Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, is the fourth official who worked under former President Barack Obama to raise malfeasance concerns about Burisma. Piatt, however, is the only individual who has not testified in the ongoing impeachment probe to deem a corruption investigation into Burisma necessary. The four complainants against Burisma suggest there is merit to U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s concerns about Hunter Biden\u2019s work on the company\u2019s board of directors. Corruption concerns about Burisma began with allegations against the Ukranian company\u2019s owner, Mykola Zlochevsy. The United States spent hundreds of thousands helping to investigate Zlochevsy. Combating corruption in Ukraine has long been a significant component of American policy towards Ukraine. House Democrats, however, refuse to allow Hunter to testify, denying that he is at the center of the impeachment probe. During the public impeachment probe hearing Tuesday, featuring testimony from U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, testified Rep. Devin Nunes from California, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee hosting the hearing, declared: You wouldn\u2019t be the first ambassador to be interested in Burisma, did you know that in 2015, U.S. Amb. Jeffrey Piatt\u2019s as U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine privately called fro an investigation into Zlochevsky, the president of Burisma. This [Piatt] is the Ukrainian ambassador appointed by Obama in Ukraine.\n\n\u2026 You would not be the first one to be mentioning that investigations should be done into Burisma because it happened under the Obama administration. Did you know that financial records show Burisma routed more $3 million into the account of Hunter Biden. Sondland claimed he was not aware of Piatt\u2019s concerns about Burisma. He also claimed ignorance of the company\u2019s decision to route more than $3 million over five years to accounts linked to Hunter Biden. Hunter served on the Ukrainian company\u2019s board directors while his father was President Obama\u2019s head honcho for Ukraine policy. Impeachment probe witnesses \u2014\u00a0George Kent, Catherine Croft, and Christopher Anderson \u2014 all raised concerns about Burisma\u2019s potential affiliation to corruption, at times when Hunter was working there. Besides former Amb. Piatt, Kent, Croft, and Anderson still all work for the State Department. They did so when they expressed concerns about Burisma. Kent testified during his October 15 closed-door deposition that he raised concerns about Burisma and its owners, but VP Biden\u2019s office ignored him. U.S. Special Envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker\u00a0and Sondland had both called for investigations into Burisma and its owner, to no avail. Echoing Volker, Sondland said during his public testimony Tuesday that an investigation into corruption allegations against Burisma would be appropriate. Trump\u2019s private attorney Rudy Giuliani traveled to Ukraine to investigate Ukraine\u2019s possible efforts to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential elections. Democrats and their mainstream media allies argue there is no wrongdoing evidence against the Bidens. At the behest of VP Biden, however, information into the matter was buried. Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor Viktor Shokin who had investigated Burisma, threatening to withhold loan guarantees if it did not play ball. If that sounds familiar, you have been paying attention, because it sounds like the quid pro quo that Dems are trying to pin on Trump. \u201cShokin\u2019s replacement, Yuri Lutsenko, continued the investigation into Burisma and concluded there was no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe Biden or his son,\u201d the New York Post noted. Corruption, however, is prevalent in Ukraine and could have played a role in clearing the Bidens. Russian Ryaboshapka, the new prosecutor under Zelensky \u2014 who ran on combating corruption, has vowed to \u201creview all previous cases concerning [the Burisma] gas company at the heart of the impeachment inquiry into President Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine,\u201d the Washington Post reported on October 4. A U.S. intelligence community \u201cwhistleblower\u201d complaint filed August 12 accuses Trump of engaging in a quid pro quo during a July 25 call in which he allegedly pressured Zelensky to investigate the Bidens in exchange for aid, The testimony from four State officials shows that Obama knew of corruption concerns about Burisma. U.S. State testimony about corruption suggests there could be merit to Trump suggesting Ukraine investigate corruption allegations linked to the Bidens. Hunter admitted getting the lucrative job at Burisma because of his father\u2019s position. Even officials who have testified against Trump\u2019s interactions in Ukraine have said there was no pressure for the Eastern European country to investigate the Bidens. House Democrats are not allowing the Republicans to request the \u201cwhistleblower,\u201d whose complaint alleging a quid pro quo trigge\u00e5d the impeachment probe, and Hunter Biden to testify.",

Unlike the other Democrats, Biden\u2019s response was disjointed and punctuated by a stutter at certain points. The stutter, which Biden has previously discussed overcoming as a child, caught the notice of many on social media.     Since jumping into the presidential race, the 77-year-old former vice president has been known to stammer and slur his words on the campaign trail. Most notably, Biden slurred through his first speech as a candidate in April, often confounding his audience by using words like \u201cbaldanny,\u201d among others. \u201cI want to thank Rich Fritzgerald, the county executive for \u2014 the baladanny \u2014 the Allegheny County executive for being here,\u201d the former vice president said at the time, before proceeding to stumble over the words dignity, success, and hospitals.",

That\u2019s pretty clear,\u201d the 2020 Democrat presidential candidate said during his opening remarks at the Democrat debate in Atlanta, Georgia, hosted by MSNBC and the Washington Post. He continued: He held up aid to make sure that while [at] the same time innocent people in the Donbas were being killed by Russian soldiers. Secondly, I found out that Vladimir Putin doesn\u2019t want me to be president. So I\u2019ve learned a lot about these hearings early on, from these hearings that were being held. But the bottom line is, I think we have to ask ourselves an honest question, Who is most likely to do what needs to be done? Produce a democratic majority in the United States Senate, maintain the House, and beat Trump. In a November 1 interview with PBS\u2019s Judy Woodruff, Biden said he believed that President Trump was involved in a cover-up regarding his phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky. Biden stated: The idea that someone would invite a foreign power into our election and in the process withhold \u2014apparently the allegation by some within the administration who heard the conversations \u2014 withhold vital aid, military aid voted for by the Congress while Ukrainian are dying\u2026 is just one of the things that no president that I\u2019m aware of would ever thought of doing. However, President Trump quoted portions of the testimony by U.S. Ambassador to the EU, Gordon Sondland, Wednesday outside the White House that refuted Biden\u2019s claims. \u201cI want nothing. I want nothing,\u201d the president read.\u201dI want no quid pro quo.

In August, Biden compared Trump to the Ku Klux Klan, claiming the president had used \u201cdog whistle\u201d language to signal it was acceptable to be racist. \u201cThis is a president who has said things no other president has said since Andrew Jackson,\u201d Biden told Anderson Cooper during an interview on CNN. \u201cNobody\u2019s said anything like the things he\u2019s saying.\u201d \u201cWe went through it after the Civil War in terms of the Ku Klux Klan and white supremacy,\u201d the former vice president added. \u201cThis is about separating people into the good and bad in his mind.

Elise Stefanik (R-NY) while testifying before the House Intelligence about Hunter Biden\u2019s position on the board of directors of Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian oil and gas conglomerate. Stefanik, in particular, wanted to know if Sondland believed the younger Biden\u2019s work with Burisma had the appearance of a conflict of interest, especially because it began shortly after Joe Biden was tapped to lead Obama-era policy in Ukraine. \u201cClearly it\u2019s an appearance of a conflict,\u201d Sondland told lawmakers, echoing a sentiment expressed by other witnesses of the inquiry. Since the impeachment inquiry went public last week, five witnesses congressional Democrats claim are key to their impeachment case have told lawmakers that Hunter Biden\u2019s role had the appearance of a conflict. The admissions came from career foreign service officer former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanvitch, national security officials, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, and even political appointees like Theresa Williams, a foreign policy adviser to Vice President Mike Pence. On the first day of the inquiry, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent even admitted that the younger Biden\u2019s dealings with Burisma had troubled him so much that he had reached out to then-Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s office in 2015 about the matter. \u201cIn a briefing call with\u2026the office of the Vice President\u2026I raised my concern that Hunter Biden\u2019s status as a [Burisma] board member could create the perception of a conflict of interest,\u201d Kent testified. The admissions have undermined the argument Democrats are making that Trump\u2019s suggestion Ukraine investigate Hunter Biden and Burisma amounted to an impeachable offense. At the center of controversy is how and why Hunter Biden secured the appointment, which at times paid more than $83,000 a month. As Peter Schweizer, senior contributor at Breitbart News, detailed in his\u00a0book,\u00a0Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends, Hunter Biden had no prior experience with either the energy industry or Ukraine before joining Burisma in April 2014. In fact, his background in investment banking, lobbying, and hedge fund management paled in comparison to that of current and past members of the company\u2019s board of directors. Adding to concerns is the fact that, at the time Hunter Biden joined Burisma, the company was seen as actively courting western leaders to prevent further scrutiny of its business practices. The same month Hunter Biden was tapped for the group\u2019s board, the government of Great Britain\u00a0froze\u00a0accounts belonging to Zlochevsky under suspicion of money laundering. Zlochevsky, a former Ukrainian minister of natural resources, would later be accused of\u00a0corruption\u00a0for using his office to approve oil and gas licenses to companies under his control. A Ukrainian official with strong ties to Zlochevsky admitted in October the only reason that Hunter Biden secured the appointment was to \u201cprotect\u201d the company from foreign scrutiny. The claim has credence given that at the time, Joe Biden, as the sitting vice president, was tasked with leading the Obama administration\u2019s policy towards Ukraine in response to Russia\u2019s invasion of Crimea. It is in the context of Burisma and Zlochevsky\u2019s legal troubles that Joe Biden\u2019s political influence has raised the most red flags. The former vice president has particularly drawn questions over his conduct in demanding the Ukrainian government fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, in 2016. Joe Biden, who has publicly\u00a0bragged\u00a0about the firing, reportedly threatened to withhold more than one billion\u00a0dollars in U.S. aid if the Ukrainian government did not remove Shokin. He has claimed the demand came from then-President Barack Obama, who had allegedly lost faith in the prosecutor\u2019s ability to tackle corruption. Unofficially, though, it was known that Shokin was investigating both Burisma and Zlochevsky for public corruption. It is uncertain if the probe extended to Hunter Biden, although Shokin has recently admitted that prior to his ouster he was\u00a0warned\u00a0to back off the matter. Regardless of what occurred, Shokin\u2019s successor, who is now himself being\u00a0investigated\u00a0for public corruption,\u00a0dropped the investigation into Burisma and Zlochevsky. The situation only became more complicated in October when Hunter Biden, himself,\u00a0admitted\u00a0his father\u2019s political influence was the likely reason for his appointment to Burisma\u2019s board during a recent ABC News interview. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. Probably not, in retrospect,\u201d the younger Biden said when asked if he would have been tapped for the lucrative job had his father not been the sitting vice president. He quickly added, though, that\u00a0his family\u2019s political prominence had always played a large role in his dealings. \u201cBut that\u2019s\u2014you know\u2014I don\u2019t think that there\u2019s a lot of things that would have happened in my life if my last name wasn\u2019t Biden.\u201d",

However, the United States cosigned a letter with the United Nations this year, backing sanctions against North Korea, according to Breitbart News. The article continued: The Trump administration has insisted it will not ease sanctions\u00a0on Pyongyang\u00a0over its nuclear program until Kim can prove the nation has completely, irreversibly, ended it. The U.N. letter that\u00a0offended the North Koreans \u2013 reportedly also signed by France, Germany, and the United Kingdom \u2013 reiterated that commitment and urged\u00a0other nations to adhere to the sanctions. In July, the U.S. State Department denied reports from South Korea that said President Trump might ease the sanctions on North Korea and called them \u201ccompletely false.\u201d \u201c[W]hile we don\u2019t preview any sort of sanctions from the podium, whether it\u2019s adding new ones or taking them away, I will say that I did actually speak to Steve Biegun about that, and he categorically denied that,\u201d said State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus. In fact, a July report by the\u00a0Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency (KOTRA) said that North Korea\u2019s trade volume was cut in half last year as a result of the U.N. sanctions, according to Breitbart News. The report stated: The KOTRA report showed North Korea\u2019s trade volume falling to $2.84 billion in 2018, a 48.8 percent decline from the previous year.\u00a0Exports fell by a dizzying 86.3 percent, imports declined 31.2 percent, and the North Korean trade deficit rose by 17.5 percent. In October, the North Korean government\u2019s news agency called American officials \u201cstubborn\u201d for their refusal to ease the sanctions: It is an undeniable reality that denuclearization and sanctions are misused as tools for meeting party interests and strategies of the political forces within the U.S., not to solve bottleneck problems between the DPRK and the U.S. to even a certain extent. Finally, Trump did not cave to North Korean diplomat\u00a0Kwon Jong Gun\u2019s demands for the president to fire U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo after he refused to end the sanctions on the rogue nation.",

      "content": " Biden was speaking in the context of domestic violence and his track record of addressing the issue via legislation like the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), which he cosponsored and passed in 1994. His gaffe, that the problem of gendered violence must be solved by \u201cpunching at it and punching at it,\u201d has drawn a lot of attention on social media. But the factual inaccuracy of his claim that men \u201crarely\u201d need to defend themselves against women also deserves attention. In the context of domestic violence, which is what the VAWA sought to address, the claim is not accurate. Both late and recent studies of domestic violence show high rates of victimhood among men. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) statistics released in 2013 show 29 percent of heterosexual men reporting domestic abuse at the hands of a partner, compared to 35 percent for heterosexual women. A six-point percentage gap is not sufficient to declare the former \u201crare.\u201d An earlier meta-analysis of domestic violence studies in the United States, conducted in 2000, found that women were slightly more likely to commit acts of domestic violence but that men were more likely to cause injury. Nevertheless, the analysis still found that a \u201csubstantial minority of men were injured by a [female] partner. \u201cIt is therefore not the case \u2026 that women\u2019s violence\u00a0toward men severe enough to cause physical injury is negligible or\u00a0nonexistent,\u201d concluded the analysis. Another, more recent meta-analysis of 1,700 peer-reviewed studies on domestic violence encompassing cases from the U.S, Canada, and the U.K. found comparable rates of domestic violence victimhood for men and women (19.3 percent for men and 23 percent for women), as well as\u00a0higher\u00a0rates of female-perpetrated violence (28.3 percent female vs 21.6 percent male). All of the studies on domestic violence show varying rates of female-on-male violence vs male-on-female violence. But none of them support Joe Biden\u2019s contention that situations where men must defend themselves against women only \u201crarely\u201d occur.

One\u2019s true or the other\u2019s true, but they can\u2019t both be true, and they both said it with a straight face. It doesn\u2019t pass the smell test. \u2026\u00a0How can that be a true statement?\u201d Democrats\u2019 impeachment push against Trump is a function of their weak selection of aspiring presidential nominees, assessed Scalise. \u201cThey have no field of candidates to run against President Trump,\u201d remarked Scalise. \u201cMany Democrats have even said this is about bloodying up Donald Trump and making it harder for him to get reelected. There\u2019s no impeachable offense, but they just want to try to do damage, because their field is so weak. Last week, three high-profile Democrats talked about getting in the race for president this late in the game, including Deval Patrick.\u201d Scalise went on, \u201cThis is the most interesting. Deval Patrick said Barack Obama encouraged him to get in the race for president, last week. Now, isn\u2019t Barack Obama\u2019s vice president running for president? Why is nobody in the media asking Joe Biden, \u2018Why is your president, that you served under, encouraging other Democrats to get in when you\u2019re in?\u2019 That\u2019s a huge swipe at Joe Biden by Barack Obama.\u201d Trump has a legal obligation to prevent U.S. foreign aid from being lost to corruption, explained Scalise. \u201cThe law says that if you give taxpayer money \u2014 foreign aid \u2014 to a foreign country, and specifically, in other sets of law, if it\u2019s Ukraine \u2014 because they\u2019ve had a history of corruption \u2014 that by law, the president, through DoD, has to certify that [the recipient] country is rooting out corruption, and of course you just had a change of government [in Ukraine]. Zelensky had just gotten elected \u2026 on a platform of rooting out corruption. \u2026 So we were in the process of verifying that he was rooting out corruption, so the president had a legal requirement before he gave the aid to verify that they were cleaning up corruption.\u201d Witnesses asked by Republicans to \u201cname an impeachable offense\u201d committed by Trump have been unable to do so, concluded Scalise.

      "subtitle": "The Ukrainian oligarch who appointed Hunter Biden to the board of directors of Burisma Holdings is facing new allegations of public corruption and embezzlement in his native country.",
      "author": "Haris Alic",
      "content": " Ukrainian authorities announced on Wednesday they were widening their investigation into Burisma and its founder,\u00a0Mykola Zlochevsky, after coming across evidence seeming to suggest public funds were embezzled. Zlochevsky,\u00a0who previously served as Ukraine\u2019s minister of natural resources, is suspected\u00a0of having used his governmental office to approve oil and gas licenses to Burisma. The oligarch is also alleged to have violated Ukraine\u2019s tax and money laundering laws while scheming to hide his business empire, according to The Daily Mail. Although the Ukrainian prosecutor general\u2019s office did not elaborate on the extent of Zlochevsky\u2019s alleged crimes, three of the country\u2019s lawmakers leaked documents at a press conference on Wednesday indicating the oligarch was suspected of embezzling upwards of $33 million from the state-run bank. The news comes as Burisma and its relationship to Hunter Biden take center stage in the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump. The company became central to the proceedings when Trump suggested the Ukrainian government investigate how Hunter Biden was able to secure a seat on its board of directors in the first place. Democrats argue the president\u2019s suggestion to Ukraine likely amounted to an impeachable offense at the launch of their inquiry. Trump and his allies, on the other hand, have claimed Hunter Biden\u2019s appointment, coming around the same time his father was tapped to lead Obama-era policy towards Ukraine, and his relative inexperience in the energy industry, warrant investigation. As Peter Schweizer, senior contributor at Breitbart News, detailed in his\u00a0book,\u00a0Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends, Hunter Biden had no prior experience with either the energy industry or Ukraine before joining Burisma in April 2014. In fact, his background in investment banking, lobbying, and hedge fund management paled in comparison to that of current and past members of the company\u2019s board of directors. Adding to concerns is the fact that, at the time Hunter Biden joined Burisma\u2014where he was paid as much as $83,00-per-month\u2014the company was seen as actively courting western leaders to prevent further scrutiny of its business practices. The same month Hunter Biden was tapped for the group\u2019s board, the government of Great Britain\u00a0froze\u00a0accounts belonging to Zlochevsky under suspicion of money laundering. A Ukrainian official with strong ties to Zlochevsky admitted in October the only reason that Hunter Biden secured the appointment was to \u201cprotect\u201d the company from foreign scrutiny. The claim has credence given that at the time, Joe Biden, as the sitting vice president, was tasked with leading the Obama administration\u2019s policy towards Ukraine in response to Russia\u2019s invasion of Crimea. It is in the context of Burisma and Zlochevsky\u2019s legal troubles that Joe Biden\u2019s political influence has raised the most red flags. The former vice president has particularly drawn questions over his conduct in demanding the Ukrainian government fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, in 2016. Joe Biden, who has publicly\u00a0bragged\u00a0about the firing, reportedly threatened to withhold more than one billion\u00a0dollars in U.S. aid if the Ukrainian government did not remove Shokin. He has claimed the demand came from then-President Barack Obama, who had allegedly lost faith in the prosecutor\u2019s ability to tackle corruption. Unofficially, though, it was known that Shokin was investigating both Burisma and Zlochevsky for public corruption. It is uncertain if the probe extended to Hunter Biden, although Shokin has recently admitted that prior to his ouster, he was\u00a0warned\u00a0to back off the matter. Regardless of what occurred, Shokin\u2019s successor, who is now himself being\u00a0investigated\u00a0for public corruption,\u00a0dropped the investigation into Burisma and Zlochevsky. The timing and reason for the case\u2019s closure has generated scrutiny in Ukraine in recent months, especially as Shokin\u2019s successor is now under investigation himself for public corruption. In October, Ruslan Ryaboshapka, Ukraine\u2019s newly appointed prosecutor general, ordered a review of the case to ensure no illegal conduct was taken when closing the investigation. \u201cWe are now reviewing all the cases which were closed, fragmented or investigated earlier in order to make a decision on cases where illegal procedural decisions were taken,\u201d Ryaboshapka said when announcing the review.",

      "author": "Haris Alic",
      "content": " The former vice president, who has a history of refusing to discuss issues realting to his family, was asked by a reporter from Fox News to comment on court documents released Wednesday in an Arkansas paternity case lodged against Hunter Biden. The documents, which included a DNA test, indicated the younger Biden was the biological father of a child born in August 2018 to Lunden Alexis Roberts, a native of Batesville, Arkansas. Roberts, who claims to have been in a relationship with Hunter Biden, filed the suit in May, requesting paternity and child support. Hunter Biden, for his part, has denied fathering the child since the suit became became public. Despite the situation playing publicly, the former vice president was unwilling to acknowledge his newest grandchild on Thursday. \u201cNo. That\u2019s a private matter,\u201d Biden snapped at Peter Doocey, a reporter for Fox News, when asked to comment. The former vice president then proceeded to mock Doocey for even broaching the subject. \u201cBut only you would ask that, you\u2019re a good man. You\u2019re a good man. Classy,\u201d Biden said testily, in video captured by the Washington Examiner.  The paternity suit is only the latest headache Hunter Biden has caused his father\u2019s presidential campaign. Initially, the younger Biden was supposed to play a key role in the campaign, but such plans were\u00a0squashed\u00a0after Breitbart News\u00a0reported\u00a0on a 2016 incident in which a cocaine pipe was found in a car he rented in Arizona. News of the incident was enough to scuttle a planned appearance by Hunter Biden at his father\u2019s campaign launch in late April. Since then, every time the younger Biden\u2019s name has appeared in the news, it has been associated with controversy. Most notably, Hunter Biden has found himself the\u00a0center of the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry after President Donald Trump suggested the Ukrainian government look into his business dealings in the country.",

      "subtitle": "A majority of registered voters in Wisconsin oppose the impeachment and removal from office of President Trump, according to a poll released by Marquette University Law School Poll on Wednesday.",
      "author": "Michael Patrick Leahy",
      "content": " Fifty-three percent of poll respondents said they oppose the impeachment and removal from office of the president, while only 40 percent support it. The poll of 801 Wisconsin registered voters was conducted between November 13 and November 17. The poll of the key battleground state President Trump won in 2016 over Hillary Clinton by just 22,000 votes had more good news for the president. President Trump defeated five of the six 2020 Democrat presidential candidates polled against him in head-to-head matchups: former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Pete Buttigieg, and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN). Trump\u2019s lead ranged from three percent (against Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders) to five percent (Elizabeth Warren) to eight percent (against Pete Buttigieg) to 13 percent (against Amy Klobuchar). You can see the results of these five matchups here: President Trump 47 percent vs. Joe Biden 44 percent.\n\nPresident Trump 48 percent vs.\u00a0 Bernie Sanders 45 percent.\n\nPresident Trump 48 percent vs. Elizabeth Warren 43 percent.\n\nPresident Trump 47 percent vs. Pete Buttigieg 39 percent\n\nPresident Trump 50 percent vs. Amy Klobuchar 37 percent Surprisingly, Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ), who is not among the top tier of 2020 Democratic presidential contenders in any national poll, is the only Democrat candidate who currently leads the president in Wisconsin, but that lead is a very narrow one. Booker has the support of 45 percent of poll respondents, compared to the 44 percent who support President Trump in a head-to-head matchup. The poll also has some good news for former Vice President Joe Biden, who is the number one choice of likely Democrat primary voters. Among likely voters in the April 7 Wisconsin Democrat primary voters, 30 percent say they would vote for Joe Biden. Bernie Sanders is in a distant second place with 17 percent, followed by Elizabeth Warren in third place with 15 percent and Pete Buttigieg in fourth place with 13 percent. Cory Booker and Amy Klobuchar are tied for fifth place with three percent, while Andrew Yang and Kamala Harris are tied for seventh place with two percent. Wisconsin voters appear to not be all that interested in the details of the current impeachment investigation. Only 32 percent of respondents said they \u201cfollowed the news and testimony in the impeachment investigation by the House of Representatives\u201d very closely. Another 33 percent said they followed it fairly closely. Thirty-four percent said they followed it not closely or not at all. The Wisconsin poll was just the latest in a string of national and battleground state polls that have been favorable to the president. Wisconsin voters, though, appear to have a nuanced view of the president\u2019s conduct in office. Fifty-two percent of poll respondents believe President Trump asked the Ukrainian president to investigate his political rivals, while 29 percent do not, and 18 percent don\u2019t know. Forty-one percent of poll respondents believe President Trump\u00a0held up military aid to pressure the Ukrainian president to investigate his political rivals, while 38 percent do not believe he held up the aid. On the bigger question of whether he did something \u201cseriously wrong\u201d in his dealings with Ukraine, a plurality of Wisconsin voters give President Trump the benefit of the doubt. While 42 percent of poll respondents believe the president did something \u201cseriously wrong\u201d in his dealings with Ukraine, 38 percent believe he did nothing wrong,\u00a0 while nine percent believe he did something wrong, but not seriously so. The president\u2019s job approval rating remains slightly under water with Wisconsin voters. Fifty-one percent of poll respondents disapprove of the president\u2019s job performance either \u201cstrongly\u201d or \u201csomewhat,\u201d while 47 percent approve of his job performance \u201cstrongly\u201d or \u201csomewhat.\u201d The president gets good ratings for his handling of the economy, with 55 percent approving his performance on that front and 40 percent disapproving it. Forty-five percent of poll respondents identified as Republican, 44 percent identified as Democrat, and ten percent identified as Independent.",

The senator requested all documents and communications related to Joe Biden\u2019s phone calls with Poroshenko on Feb. 11, 18 and 19, and March 22, 2016, citing media reports that they discussed previous demands to dismiss Shokin for alleged corruption before he was removed from office on March 29, 2016. Graham also requested documents and communications between Joe Biden and his office and Poreshenko and his office between Feb. 2, 2016, when Burisma founder Mykola Zlochevsky\u2019s home was raided and Shokin\u2019s dismissal. Lastly, Graham sought all documents and communications related to a meeting between Devon Archer, a business partner of Hunter Biden, and then-Secretary of State John Kerry on March 2, 2016. Graham\u2019s request comes after two weeks of public testimony on the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, which centers around a whistle-blower\u2019s complaint that Trump withheld military aid from Ukraine in an attempt to pressure newly elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Burisma and the Bidens.",

      "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
      "content": " The\u00a0Examiner\u00a0reported: An investment firm linked to Hunter Biden received over $130 million in federal bailout loans while his father Joe Biden was vice president and routed profits through a subsidiary in the Cayman Islands, according to federal banking and corporate records reviewed by the Washington Examiner. \u2026 Rosemont Capital, an investment firm at the center of Hunter Biden\u2019s much-scrutinized financial network, was one of the companies approved to participate in the 2009 federal loan program known as the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, or TALF. \u2026 Biden, Heinz, and Archer incorporated Rosemont Seneca Partners in Delaware on June 25, 2009. The \u201calternative investment and market advisory firm\u201d was an offshoot of Rosemont Capital, which held a 50% stake in the new venture. Rosemont Seneca and Rosemont Capital shared the same office address in lower Manhattan and the same New York phone number, according to Securities and Exchange Commission documents. Three weeks after Rosemont Seneca was incorporated, a subsidiary of Rosemont Capital, called Rosemont TALF SPV, received $23.5 million in federal loans through the TALF program. This included $13.4 million to invest in student loans and $11.1 million to invest in subprime auto loans. Over five months, the company received a total of $130 million from the program in multiple installments for investments in subprime credit cards and residential mortgages. The timing is significant, the\u00a0Examiner notes, because then-Sen. Joe Biden (D-DE) backed the bailout: \u201cHe delayed his Senate resignation in January 2009 to cast his final vote to increase funding for the Troubled Asset Relief Program before taking office as vice president.\u201d Another point not mentioned by the Examiner is that President Barack Obama immediately put Vice President\u00a0Biden in charge of overseeing the federal government\u2019s disbursement of stimulus funds \u2014 which were a separate program from the bailout, but which were closely associated in the public mind. In a statement titled, \u201cVice President Biden to Oversee the Administration\u2019s Implementation of the Recovery Act\u2019s Provisions,\u201d the Obama administration announced that Biden would be in charge of making sure stimulus funds were being properly spent, and that there was transparency in the program, with updates posted at Recovery.gov. The website was soon mocked for listing grants that went to non-existent congressional districts, among other errors. Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

Rose said: Immediately when this Ukraine scandal hit, right out the door I said that this is alarming, a potential national security issue, something that we have to get to the bottom of, and all options are on the table. Over the course of several days thereafter, it became clear that this administration was going to practice pure and unadulterated obstruction and deflection and lying in the process, and it was at that point that I did make the decision to support this impeachment inquiry.

The fact that his son, Hunter Biden, was appointed to a lucrative board position at Burisma in 2014 while he himself was overseeing the Obama administration\u2019s policy toward Ukraine created a conflict of interest so problematic that Obama administration officials had to brief\u00a0Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch about it before her Senate confirmation hearing in 2016. (They did nothing to resolve it.) It seems Hunter Biden made a habit of enriching himself by exploiting his father\u2019s position. Even if Vice President Biden did the right thing in 2016 by demanding Ukraine fire an allegedly corrupt prosecutor, on pain of losing $1 billion in U.S. aid, and even if the investigation into Burisma was dormant at the time, he ought to have recused himself. Worse, Joe Biden has given confusing answers about whether he knew of his son\u2019s business activities. We do not yet know the truth about the Bidens \u2014 and, worse, we do not know what Ukraine knows (or China, where Hunter Biden also pursued business opportunities allegedly opened up by his father\u2019s political position). As Democrats have argued in the past, it would be a \u201ccounterintelligence nightmare\u201d if a \u201cforeign power\u201d had \u201ccompromising information\u201d or \u201cleverage\u201d over a president. We ought to know about that before Biden takes office. The same logic Democrats applied to investigating Trump\u2019s (imaginary) Russia ties justifies the investigation into Biden\u2019s (real) Ukraine links. When President Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in July to investigate the circumstances in which then-Vice President Joe Biden forced out the prosecutor \u2014 and his demand was limited to that \u2014 he was acting on what Democrats themselves have described often as an urgent national security interest. And unlike the Obama administration, which may have misled a FISA court to obtain surveillance warrants, Trump made the request lawfully, referring Zelensky to the Attorney General. There is a clear dilemma in both the Trump-Russia investigation and the Biden-Ukraine investigation: it is hard to separate the public interest from political motives, especially in an election year. Likewise with the investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s misuse of a private email server, which was marred by politics. Some of the FBI and CIA officials who investigated Trump, like Peter Strzok, clearly had partisan designs. But some appear to have believed, sincerely, they were acting in the best interest of the country. The inherent risk of partisanship in an election-year investigation is a puzzle that requires a legislative solution. Perhaps Congress could create a separate office in the Department of Justice, overseen by a bipartisan panel of legislators, to handle such sensitive investigations in future in a way that screens politics out of the process. But because Democrats believed so fervently in the Russia collusion hoax, they refused to see the potential abuses of power in the investigation. Now they will impeach Trump for doing what they said the government ought to do. Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " Warren, while still a top tier candidate, fell to third place in the latest Emerson poll, which was taken\u00a0November 17-20, 2019, among 1,029 registered voters. Both Sanders and Biden tied with 27 percent support each, followed by the Massachusetts senator, who garnered 20 percent support. The margin of error is +/- 2.9 percent, making her third-place status solid. The survey found that Sanders is continuing to hold on to his status as the preference for younger voters, as well as Hispanic or Latino voters. Per Emerson: Sanders continues to hold a strong lead with younger voters in the primary. Among voters under 50, Sanders received 37% support, followed by Warren with 22%, Biden with 15% and Yang with 7%. Among voters 50 and over, Biden continues to lead with 44% support, followed by Warren with 16%, Sanders with 13% and Buttigieg with 12%. \u2026 Sanders holds a lead among Hispanic or Latino voters with 36% support, followed by Biden with 23% and Warren with 22%. Sanders leads by a smaller margin with White voters with 29% support followed by Biden and Warren with 21%, and Buttigieg with 9%. Biden continues to lead with African American voters with 42% support, followed by Warren with 18%, Sanders with 17% and Buttigieg with 7%. No other candidate came close to Sanders, Biden, or Warren. Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D), who has been surging in early voting states like Iowa and New Hampshire, came in fourth with seven percent support. Andrew Yang (D) overtook Sen Kamala Harris (D-CA) for fifth place with four percent to her three percent. The remaining candidates saw two percent support or less:  \u201cBiden and Sanders continue to hold their bases, which should concern Warren, as she has waited for one of the front runners to slip these past few months \u2013 yet, their support seems to be crystalizing,\u201d Emerson Polling director Spencer Kimball said. The current Real Clear Politics average also reflects a steady Sanders surge, showing the socialist senator in second place with a 19.3 percent average compared to Warren\u2019s 18.5 percent. Notably, the Emerson poll was taken, largely, in the days leading up to Wednesday evening\u2019s Democrat presidential debate. It remains to be seen how much the debate shifted the needle among Democrat voters, although the debate saw the lowest ratings to date with just 6.5 million viewers tuning in.",

      "content": " Speaking at a campaign town hall in Greenwood, South Carolina, the former vice president was confronted by activists from a radical immigrant rights group called Movimiento Cosecha. Initially, a member of the group told Biden it was difficult as an immigrant to trust him because of\u00a0his defense of the three million deportations that occurred under President Barack Obama\u2019s tenure in office. The activist, who addressed Biden in Spanish through a translator, asked the former vice president if he would commit to ending such deportations through executive action on his first day in office. \u201cNo, I will not stop all deportations,\u201d Biden responded. \u201cI will prioritize deportations, only people who have committed a felony or a serious crime.\u201d The answer seemed not to please the Carlos Rojas, the activist who was translating for the initial questioner. Rojas, who claimed to have been a volunteer for Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign, began lecturing Biden about the deportations that occurred during his service in the vice presidency. Biden, for his part, seemed unwilling to indulge the activist. \u201cYou should vote for Trump,\u201d the former vice president cut off Rojas mid-sentence as the activist was laying out the Obama administration\u2019s record on immigration.\u201dYou should vote for Trump,\u201d Biden repeated mockingly. \u201cNo, I am not going to do that,\u201d Rojas responded, before demanding Biden pledge to end all deportations if elected in president. \u201cWe want to hear you say that.\u201d The former vice president tried to double down on his promise to not stop deportations for those that commit felonies, but was met with shouts of \u201cnot one more deportation\u201d by the crowd.  After the confrontation Movimiento Cosecha, issued a statement denouncing the former vice president\u2019s refusal to support a \u201cfull moratorium\u201d on deportations. \u201cBy now, it is clear that the immigrant community cannot trust Biden,\u201d Rojas said in the statement. \u201cWe won\u2019t accept empty promises of immigration reform, while our families are torn apart. We cannot allow history to repeat itself.\u201d This is not the first time that Biden has faced trouble over his immigration position on the campaign trail. In July, one day after his campaign headquarters was stormed by open borders protesters, the former vice president was confronted by an immigration activist in New Hampshire. The activist, who claimed to be undergoing deportation proceedings, demanded that Biden \u201capologize to the three million immigrants that were deported and separated from their families under the Obama years.\u201d The former vice president simply smirked\u00a0at the cameras taping the altercation, before telling the activist he would do no such thing. \u201cI will not apologize for the deportation of people who have committed a felony,\u201d Biden said at the time.",

They know he knows that if he comes out against Trump, he\u2019s got a real tough road for reelection, number one,\u201d the former vice president continued about the South Carolina senator. Biden then said he is \u201cangered\u201d by the probe because of his long friendship with Graham dating back to their time together in the Senate and suggested President Trump may have pressured him to launch the probe. \u201cHe knows me; he knows my son; he knows there\u2019s nothing to this,\u201d he vented. \u201cTrump is now essentially holding power over him that even the Ukrainians wouldn\u2019t yield to. The Ukrainians would not yield to, quote, \u2018investigate Biden\u2019 \u2014 there\u2019s nothing to investigate about Biden or his son.\u201d The senator requested all documents and communications related to Joe Biden\u2019s phone calls with Poroshenko on Feb. 11, 18 and 19, and March 22, 2016, citing media reports that they discussed previous demands to dismiss Shokin for alleged corruption before he was removed from office on March 29, 2016. Graham also requested documents and communications between Joe Biden and his office and Poroshenko and his office between Feb. 2, 2016, when Burisma founder Mykola Zlochevsky\u2019s home was raided and Shokin\u2019s dismissal. Graham is also seeking all documents and communications related to a meeting between Devon Archer, a business partner of Hunter Biden, and then-Secretary of State John Kerry on March 2, 2016. Graham\u2019s request comes after two weeks of public testimony on the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, which centers around a \u201cwhistleblower\u201d complaint that Trump withheld military aid from Ukraine in an attempt to pressure newly elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Burisma and the Bidens.

      "author": "Kristina Wong",
      "content": " Hurd, a moderate Republican who is retiring from Congress, has not shied away from criticizing President Trump in the past \u2014 giving hope to the left that he would break with his colleagues to support impeachment. However, he used his entire five minutes of questioning during the last hearing on Thursday to make a statement, rejecting the idea that there has been any evidence the president committed impeachable offenses. \u201cThroughout this process I have said I want to learn the facts so that we can get to the truth,\u201d he began. He said he believed the statements Trump made on the July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky were \u201cinappropriate.\u201d He also criticized the foreign policy that was being undertaken, saying that \u201cuncoordinated, confusing, and conflicting messages\u201d created uncertainty and doubt in Kiev at a time when a new reformist administration had taken office. However, he slammed Democrats\u2019 assertion that without U.S. assistance, Ukraine would not be able to function. \u201cUkraine\u2026is in a hot war with Russia and they are holding their own.We could benefit from the experience of the Ukrainians, not the other way around,\u201d he said. Then he slammed the impeachment inquiry. \u201cWhile I thought the intelligence committee would actually be engaged in oversight of the intelligence and national security communities, unfortunately we are not,\u201d he said, continuing: Over the past weeks, we have a few things. The officials on the July 25 call have many different opinions on whether the call was concerning or not, and just because Vice President Biden is running for president does not mean that corruption related to Burisma \u2014 Ukraine\u2019s largest natural gas company \u2014 and Americans\u2019 ties to it are not concerning. There\u2019s also a lot we don\u2019t know. We have not heard from Rudy Giuliani, we haven\u2019t heard from Hunter Biden. I\u2019d like to know more about both of their activities. Why they talked to whom, and to whom. Despite promises from Chairman Schiff, we have also not heard from the whistleblower \u2014 something that can occur in a closed setting without violating his or her anonymity. We need to understand the motivations and levels of coordination that happened prior to his or her complaint. He also noted that U.S. support for Ukraine was actually strengthened under the Trump administration and Ukraine is receiving all the assistance it needs, and Ukraine is undertaking important corruption reform. He said: The past few days and even today it\u2019s been reiterated in 2017 the Trump administration made the decision to provide lethal defensive aid to Ukraine after the Obama administration refused to do so. Ukraine is receiving all the security assistance as directed by Congress, President Zelensky has undertaken significant anti-corruption efforts, including eliminating the parliamentary immunity from prosecution\u2026Under President Zelensky\u2019s leadership, we have finally seen some progress at ending the Russian occupation of Ukraine. He said in conclusion: \u201cSo where does this leave us?\u00a0An impeachable offense should be compelling, overwhelmingly clear, and unambiguous, and it\u2019s not something to be rushed or taken lightly. I\u2019ve not heard evidence proving the president committed bribery or extortion,\u201d he said. Susan Hennessey, executive editor of Lawfare and CNN national security analyst, criticized Hurd for his stance: \u201cThe unfortunate reality is that people like Will Hurd looking at the evidence presented and deciding it doesn\u2019t support impeachment says more about Will Hurd than it does about the available evidence,\u201d she tweeted.

      "author": "Matthew Boyle",
      "content": " Two pieces recently published in both outlets\u2013one from Daily Beast earlier this week, and one from CNN published late Friday\u2013alleged that the Rudy Giuliani associate Lev Parnas, who is now indicted on unrelated charges, helped Nunes with a variety of matters when digging into Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election on behalf of Democrats. The Daily Beast story, from Betsy Swan (formerly Woodruff), alleges that Parnas helped Nunes set up a variety of meetings on Ukraine matters. The CNN story, from Vicky Ward, goes even further, alleging that Nunes arranged a secret trip to Vienna and met there with Victor Shokin, the Ukrainian prosecutor that former Vice President Joe Biden pushed to have fired when Shokin was investigating Burisma Holdings, the natural gas company paying Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden $83,000 per month. It is unclear at this time how much of these reports are blatantly false, but most of each of them appear to be inaccurate, according to sources familiar with the matter. As such, Nunes is planning to sue both the Daily Beast and CNN over each story. \u201cThese demonstrably false and scandalous stories published by the Daily Beast and CNN are the perfect example of defamation and reckless disregard for the truth,\u201d Nunes told Breitbart News late Friday night. \u201cSome political operative offered these fake stories to at least five different media outlets before finding someone irresponsible enough to publish them. I look forward to prosecuting these cases, including the media outlets, as well as the sources of their fake stories, to the fullest extent of the law. I intend to hold the Daily Beast and CNN accountable for their actions. They will find themselves in court soon after Thanksgiving.\u201d Nunes has had rocky relationships with both establishment media outlets, and he regularly refuses to work with\u2013or have his office cooperate with\u2013any outlet that engages in deliberate printing of inaccurate and fake information, as CNN and the Daily Beast regularly do. For instance, Nunes in this 2018 video, called CNN\u2019s Manu Raju\u2019s outlet the \u201cleading Democratic Party propaganda\u201d outlet:  CNN refused, then, to publish a Nunes quote about CNN\u2019s engagement in printing inaccurate information:  The CNN piece from Ward interestingly lays out how Nunes refuses to interact with the outlet: Over the past two weeks, CNN approached Nunes on two occasions and reached out to his communications staff to get comment for this story. In the Capitol on Nov. 14, as CNN began to ask a question about the trip to Vienna, Nunes interjected and said, \u201cI don\u2019t talk to you in this lifetime or the next lifetime.\u201d \u201cAt any time,\u201d Nunes added. \u201cOn any question.\u201d Asked again on Thursday about his travel to Vienna and his interactions with Shokin and Parnas, Nunes gave a similar response. \u201cTo be perfectly clear, I don\u2019t acknowledge any questions from you in this lifetime or the next lifetime,\u201d Nunes said while leaving the impeachment hearing. \u201cI don\u2019t acknowledge any question from you ever.\u201d The Daily Beast has similarly had a history of printing inaccurate information about Nunes, according to multiple reports detailing how the outlet has printed false and misleading stories about him. While media outlets like CNN and the Daily Beast are willingly printing this information and these allegations against people like Nunes, fed to them by Parnas\u2019 legal team, it appears to be part of a broader strategy by Parnas and his legal team to try to get out of the trouble he faces. The New York Daily News reported on Parnas attempting to curry favor with authorities in a story Friday morning: One of the Florida businessmen who worked with Rudy Giuliani on his hunt for Ukrainian dirt on Democrats has turned over a trove of \u201chard evidence\u201d to impeachment investigators \u2014 including photos and videos, one of his lawyers said Friday. Lev Parnas, who was criminally charged last month in a sweeping campaign finance scheme that overlaps with the House impeachment inquiry, had so much evidence it had to be sent to House probers in several batches, the attorney, Joseph Bondy, told the Daily News. Bondy said he has also tried to schedule a time for Parnas to testify under oath before the House Intelligence Committee about the \u201cfirst-hand knowledge\u201d he says his client has about President Trump\u2019s bid to pressure Ukraine into investigating Joe Biden\u2019s family and other Democrats before the 2020 election. It remains to be seen what will happen next, and how Nunes\u2019s lawsuit will come together. But Nunes is one of President Donald Trump\u2019s most ardent defenders, and he held the line for the last month plus among Republicans during the Democrats\u2019 \u201cimpeachment inquiry.\u201d The House Intelligence Committee, which is now chaired by Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) since Democrats took the majority in the midterm elections, just held seven total public impeachment hearings over the past two weeks.",

We\u2019ll start with my favorite numbers\u2026 By a \u00a0yuge margin of 62 to 22 percent, the all-important Independent voters who will decide the 2020 election, especially in key states, say that impeachment is \u201cmore important to politicians than it is to me.\u201d Get this\u2026 By another yuge margin, 61 to 23 percent, Independents say impeachment is more important to the media than it is to me.\u201d Vanity Fair concludes that these numbers can only mean \u201cImpeachment proceedings are viewed as bread and circuses for the anti-Trump crowd in Washington and the media.\u201d Ya\u2019 think? Another juicy number is that on the list of priorities Independents hold dear, only 27 percent describe impeachment as a top priority, which means it polls well below the deficit (74 percent), health care (72 percent), and infrastructure (70 percent) \u2014 and infrastructure is an issue Trump truly cares about, something he regularly talked about even in the years preceding his presidency. \u00a0Infrastructure is something that could have happened had Nancy Pelosi and the Democrat-run congress not become coup-obsessed, something I expected Trump and the Nervous Nancy to make a deal on. Wait, it gets better\u2026 Hilariously, as Vanity Fair is forced to acknowledge, \u201cEven Trump\u2019s absurd border wall scored as a higher priority for Independents.\u201d \u201cIndependents suffer from scandal fatigue and overall confusion,\u201d Vanity Fair adds. \u201cThey agreed with the statement \u2018[It is] difficult to tell all the investigations in Washington apart\u2019 by a roughly two-to-one margin.\u201d The left-wing publication blames part of this confusion on Trump: \u201cThis no doubt reflects a successful Trump strategy to sow confusion and spread blame. By constantly charging others with acting badly and by creating such a long litany of disputable acts, Trump has in effect led many voters to dismiss the whole mess as the type of bad thing that all politicians do.\u201d How absurd.

How are voters supposed to differentiate one hoax from another? \u00a0If it\u2019s not Trump\u2019s taxes, it\u2019s his charity, it\u2019s the emolument hoax, it\u2019s the hoax about Trump saying nice things about Nazis, it\u2019s strippers and Twitter and on and on and on until\u2026 ZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. When everything is a bombshell and everything is white supremacy and everything means the walls are closing in on Drumpf, then it all means nothing. Vanity Fair tries to close on a positive note, but it is an act of kidding one\u2019s self. \u201cThe news isn\u2019t all bad for Democrats. Independents are paying attention to the story at relatively high rates. Viewing numbers for the hearings are high, and in the polling, 50% of Independents say they heard a lot or some about the testimony of Ambassador Yovanovitch.\u201d Actually, this is terrible news for Democrats. It means voters are paying close attention and are still not convinced this impeachment proceeding is anything other just another stupid, partisan exercise performed by a Democrat Party and media (but I repeat myself) who still haven\u2019t come to terms with losing the 2016 election. The truth is this\u2026 The media\u2019s propaganda campaign failed. Badly. All the cable news outlets and all the broadcast networks hoped that airing the impeachment hearings live would give legitimacy to something that was totally illegitimate. On top of that, even as we watched the air go out of the Ukraine Hoax for two weeks as witness after witness admitted they had witnessed nothing, as witness after witness proved there could be no quid pro quo, no bribery, no extortion when Ukraine didn\u2019t know the aid had been put on hold, the fake media still screamed BOMBSHELL every 15 minutes \u2014 but no one was listening. Adam Schiff\u2019s Failure Theater launched with a pathetic 13 million viewers, and over the next two weeks that already humiliating number was cut by more than half. After three years of media hysteria, of BOMBSHELLS that never exploded, the American people know an over-cooked hoax when they see one. What\u2019s more, the American people also know that investigating Joe and Hunter Biden\u2019s looting of Ukraine for millions of dollars is \u201cinvestigating corruption,\u201d and no amount of media spin can decouple the two. When Trump asked Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, he was doing his job. He was looking out for American taxpayers. He was rooting out corruption. Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

      "content": " Reuters reported on the November 15 letter sent by Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley and Ron Johnson, chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, to Ken Blanco, the director of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network: The letter, seen by Reuters on Friday, seeks \u201csuspicious activity reports,\u201d or documents that financial institutions file with the department\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network when a case of money laundering or fraud is suspected. It was unclear if any such reports exist regarding Hunter Biden, the former vice president\u2019s son. There letter gave no evidence that Hunter Biden engaged in suspicious activity that would have been covered by such reports. The agency does not comment on the reports, a spokesman said. Fincen, as the network is known, collects more than 2 million such reports each year, and they are tipsheets that make no findings on whether illegal activity has occurred. The letter is part of an effort in Congress to defend President Donald Trump for what Republicans say is a partisan effort by Democrats to make a phone call between Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky where the Bidens\u2019 Ukrainian dealings were discussed an impeachable offense. The lawmakers set a Dec. 5 deadline for Treasury to respond to the request. Reuters noted in its report that Hunter Biden served on the board of directors for Burisima, which has been investigated for corruption. The younger Biden served on the board while Joe Biden was vice president of the United States. \u201cIn the letter, the senators said Burisma was paying Hunter Biden as much as $50,000 a month and their panels were investigating \u2018potentially improper actions by the Obama administration with respect to Burisma Holdings and Ukraine,\u2019\u201d Reuters reported. In the final paragraph of the Reuters report, another investigation is revealed: Grassley and Johnson have asked the U.S. National Archives and Records Administration for records of a 2016\u00a0White House meeting between Obama administration officials, representatives of the Ukrainian government, and officials from the Democratic National Committee.

      "subtitle": "WASHINGTON, DC \u2014 Dr. Fiona Hill, a former National Security Council (NSC) official, indicated to House impeachment investigators during a public hearing earlier this week that senior White House official Kash Patel did not try to misrepresent himself to President Trump as an all-knowing expert on Ukraine, as reported by\u00a0Politico.",
      "author": "Edwin Mora",
      "content": " In other words, Hill, during her November 21 testimony, undermined two Politico reports that Patel claimed the news outlet gleaned from false leaks from House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA), the chief impeachment inquisitor. In a defamation lawsuit filed November 18, Patel accused\u00a0Natasha Bertrand, a national security reporter for Politico, of\u00a0writing two false stories based on false information allegedly leaked by Schiff and his staff claiming the White House official\u00a0was feeding Trump negative information about Ukraine. Bertrand suggested Patel misrepresented himself as a sort of top Ukraine expert or director of U.S. policy towards the country. Hill\u2019s testimony appears to suggest Patel stayed out of Ukraine matters.\u00a0Patel is a former staffer for Rep. Devin Nunes from California, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee. After serving for Nunes, Patel later moved to the White House in the NSC to advise the president on national security and intelligence matters. Hill resigned as the deputy assistant to the President and senior director for European and Russian Affairs at the NSC days before the July 25 phone call considered the crux of the impeachment inquiry. Former Trump national security adviser John Bolton served as Hill\u2019s boss. Hill was very involved in U.S. policy towards Ukraine, so if Patel would have played any role in pushing any sort of narrative about the Eastern European country, she would have likely been aware. Schiff and/or members of his staff leaked false information to\u00a0Politico\u00a0as part of a \u201cscheme\u201d to advance efforts to impeach and remove Trump. Senior NSC counterterrorism official Patel filed a lawsuit last Monday accusing Politico of defaming him as it tried to fuel the House Democrats\u2019 impeachment probe with false information that was supposed to originate from closed-door testimony. To fit his narrative, Schiff allegedly provided altered information from the closed-door deposition obtained from Hill and NSC Director of European Affairs Lt. Col. Alexander\u00a0Vindman. Hill denied some of that information. During Hill\u2019s public hearing on Thursday, Daniel Goldman, the Democrat\u2019 Intelligence Committee lawyer, asked Hill, \u201cKash Patel did not work on Ukraine matters that you oversaw, is that right?\u201d \u201cNot that I oversaw, no,\u201d Hill responded, contradicting, at least in part, the claims made by Politico. Despite Hill\u2019s denial, Goldman pressed, \u201cSo the indication is that Kash Patel had provided some information directly to the President without your knowledge?\u201d \u201cThat seems to be the indication,\u201d she replied, apparently referring to news articles and hearsay by unnamed White House officials. In other words, Hill did not have first-hand knowledge that Patel provided negative Ukraine information to Trump. She only presumed that he did after the Politico stories, based on information allegedly leaked by Schiff and his staff, came to light. Via the\u00a0Politico articles \u2014 one of which was published aheadof Hill\u2019s public testimony\u00a0\u2014Schiff could have made it seem that Patel was providing negative Ukraine information to Trump to fit his impeachment agenda. It would have been unlikely for Hill, who was charged with Ukraine within the same office that employed Patel, not to know who was saying what about the Eastern European country to Trump. Under questioning by a Democrat lawmaker, Hill explicitly denied that Patel had attempted to represent himself to the president as the director of Ukraine, which is what the information provided by Schiff and his staff to Politico suggested. Attempting to put words in her mouth, Rep. Eric\u00a0Swalwell asked the witness, \u201cSo I want to walk you through something you told us earlier. You said that you have evidence that as recently as this year, President Trump believes someone named Kash was that Ukraine director. Is that right?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not really evidence. And look, I want to be very clear about this. I was asked a question about this in my [October 14 closed door] deposition. I did not raise it. And to be honest, I was surprised I was asked the question.\u201d During her deposition in October, Hill told investigators that Patel served in a\u00a0leadership post focusing on counterterrorism for the\u00a0NSC\u2019s Directorate of International Organizations and Alliances. When Daniel Noble, a senior counsel for the House Democrats pursuing the impeachment probe, asked Hill what appeared to be a leading question about Patel\u2019s role at the NSC, Hill stressed that he was not the Ukraine director. Echoing the Politico articles \u2014 again gleaned from allegedly false information provided by Schiff and his staff, Noble, not Hill, suggested that Trump relied on Patel as the NSC\u2019s Ukraine director. Noble said she was \u201cconfused\u201d when an unnamed White House official described Patel as the Ukraine director who was expected to debrief Trump on Ukraine in May, soon after the inauguration of the country\u2019s new President, Volodymyr Zelensky. Hill pointed out that she was \u201csurprised\u201d an official described Patel as the NSC Ukrainian director, because that title belonged to Col. Vindman. She noted that she found out that Patel had a role on Ukraine, but not as director. At Noble\u2019s behest, Hill made it clear that she did not know in what capacity Patel was working on Ukraine or what sort of materials he was providing to the president about the country, if any. Regarding the debriefing meeting, she added, \u201cI had never heard any information to suggest that [Patel] was there.\u201d\u00a0Vindman, however, did participate. Hill never brought up Patel during her October 14 deposition, as she indicated during her public hearing. Noble, however, asked, \u201cWhat was [Patel\u2019s] role as far as you know?\u201d The former senior director for European and Russian Affairs at the NSC responded, \u201cI thought, well, he is in our International 0rganizations Bureau and, you know, considerably he works on the U.N. and other related\u00a0issues but he\u2019s not the Ukraine director. It appears the Democrats made an attempt to make Hill say Patel served as a Ukraine director, bypassing Vindman, but they failed. Had Hill identified Patel as the Ukraine director, she would have confirmed the Politico articles, at least in part, that the NSC official was misrepresenting himself to Trump. Again, Schiff and his staff leaked the allegedly false info behind the Politico reports allegedly berating Patel. Patel filed a defamation lawsuit against\u00a0Politico, Bertrand, and\u00a0Robert Allbritton, the publisher and executive chairman of the media organization, all identified as defendants. In the lawsuit, Patel proclaims: Between October 14, 2019 and November 8, 2019, Politico and Bertrand colluded, collaborated and conspired with Schiff to defame Kash. Schiff, or members of his staff or aides acting at his direction, leaked to Bertrand the closed-door testimony that Hill and Vindman\u00a0gave in the subfloor of the Capitol Visitor Center. The leaks occurred in real-time. Schiff leaked the testimony to Bertrand because Schiff knew that it would be a violation of House Rules and Committee Rules for Schiff to publish the substance of the testimony himself. The joint collaborative purpose of the leaks was to publish Hill and Vindman\u2019s false and defamatory statements, including Hill and Vindman\u2019s egregious personal attacks on Kash, so as to further Schiff and\u00a0Politico\u2019s\u00a0interests in harming the President and advancing the impeachment inquisition. In furtherance of the conspiracy, Bertrand secretly communicated with Schiff or his staff via encrypted email, including proton-mail, and messaging services, such as Signal. The lawsuit identifies the two Bertrand Politico articles as \u201cNunes Protege Fed Ukraine Info to Trump\u201c\u2014 published on October 23, and \u201cTestimony: Nunes Acolyte Misrepresented to Trump as Ukraine Expert\u201d published on October 30. The articles suggest Patel tried to fill Trump\u2019s mind with bad thoughts about Ukraine. Patel is a former staffer for Nunes, who later moved to the White House in the NSC to advise the president on national security and intelligence matters.",

      "content": " Bloomberg, 77, was born on February 14, 1942, making him nine months older than former Vice President Joe Biden, 77, who was born in November 1942. However, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), 78, born in September 1941, remains the oldest candidate by about five months. President Donald Trump, 72, was born in 1946 and was 69 years old when he launched his presidential campaign. Democrats now have four major candidates in their seventies. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) turned 70 in June this year. In contrast, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg is only 37 years old \u2014 roughly half the age of the three national frontrunners. (He leads the latest polls in Iowa and New Hampshire, the two first states to vote in the primary process.) In an announcement on his campaign website, Bloomberg declared: We cannot afford four more years of President Trump\u2019s reckless and unethical actions. He represents an existential threat to our country and our values. If he wins another term in office, we may never recover from the damage. The stakes could not be higher. We must win this election. And we must begin rebuilding America. I believe my unique set of experiences in business, government, and philanthropy will enable me to win and lead. As a candidate, I\u2019ll rally a broad and diverse coalition of Americans to win. And as president, I have the skills to fix what is broken in our great nation. And there is a lot broken. Bloomberg is apparently going to skip the four early primaries and spend heavily on advertising in the hope of picking up a large number of delegates on Super Tuesday, March 3, 2020. Joel B.
