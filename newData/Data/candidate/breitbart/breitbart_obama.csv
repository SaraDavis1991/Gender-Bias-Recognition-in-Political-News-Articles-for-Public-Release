This happened despite the explosion of black social and economic dynamism that began to take form post-World War II. It is also true that we blacks have now spent several decades avoiding turning the spotlight on ourselves. We’ve too often blamed what’s clearly a genocidal self-destruction on racism and faceless societal woes. We’re overwhelmingly responsible for putting each other in body bags; sending each other to the morgue, our bodies riddled with bullets. Yet, the political left insists that we’re not supposed to ask how racism is responsible for that havoc? Black childbearing-aged women make up four percent of the population but account for over 35 percent of all abortions. Is this glaring disregard for the black unborn also the fault of racism? Democrats want us to believe it is. What about the 70 percent illegitimacy rate among blacks (90 percent in some inner cities)? This is self-sabotage. These failures are on us."
