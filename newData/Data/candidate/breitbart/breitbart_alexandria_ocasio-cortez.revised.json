      "content": " The Justice Democrats helped Ocasio-Cortez oust veteran Rep. Joe Crowley (D-NY) in a primary in New York\u2019s 14th congressional district earlier this year. In a tweet, she supported the Justice Democrats\u2019 new \u201c#OurTime\u201d campaign:  Since winning her election Nov. 6, Ocasio-Cortez has continued to challenge the Democratic Party leadership, joining a sit-in protest in the office of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) over climate change policy. Though she has not yet taken office, Ocasio-Cortez is already committing to replacing many of her colleagues \u2014 apparently on the basis of race and ideology. A press release from the Justice Democrats declared (original emphasis): After participating in sit-ins at Nancy Pelosi\u2019s office on Tuesday, Justice Democrats\u00a0officially launched the #OurTime project to repeat the organization\u2019s success in recruiting and electing Congresswoman-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The progressive grassroots organization will recruit the next generation of primary challengers to Democratic incumbents who are demographically and ideologically out-of-touch with their districts. The online conference call where the project was announced was\u00a0joined by Ocasio-Cortez, who voiced her support for the project. \u201cWe recruited and supported Ocasio-Cortez all the way to a historic victory and now we\u2019re going to repeat the playbook,\u201d said Justice Democrats Executive Director Alexandra Rojas. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of blue districts in this country where communities want to support a new generation of diverse working-class leaders who fight tirelessly for their voters and build a movement around big solutions to our country\u2019s biggest problems. We\u2019re creating an alternative pathway to Congress for grassroots candidates to become leaders in the Democratic Party.\u201d The #OurTime project is a grassroots candidate recruitment effort asking Democrats and progressives around the country to submit nominees for both potential candidates and districts where an Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez-style campaign might succeed. The organization will prioritize candidates who are women, represent the diversity of communities in their district, and support the major tenets of Justice Democrats platform: rejecting corporate PAC donations, Medicare For All, free college, dismantling mass incarceration and deportations, and a Green New Deal. Others backing the campaign include Palestinian American Representative-elect Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), whose views are so hostile to Israel that even the left-wing J Street organization withdrew its support for her campaign.

(Zimbabwe\u2019s ruling party and its recently-ousted dictator, Robert Mugabe, defined themselves as socialist.) Socialist @AOC discusses Venezuela.

Used by scholars,\u00a0activists and an increasing number of journalists, Latinx is quickly gaining popularity among the general public. It\u2019s part of a \u201clinguistic revolution\u201d\u00a0that aims to move beyond gender binaries and is inclusive of the intersecting identities of\u00a0Latin American descendants. In addition to men and women from all racial backgrounds, Latinx also makes room for people who are trans, queer, agender, non-binary, gender non-conforming or gender fluid. According to Google Trends data cited by HuffPost, the term was virtually unknown in Internet searches before 2016. Ocasio-Cortez is a big fan of the term, judging from her Twitter feed:       It is not clear whether Ocasio-Cortez herself identifies as gender-neutral. If so, she could become the first gender-neutral member of Congress, should she win the general election in November. Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

Epstein\u2019s body was found in his jail cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) around 7:30 a.m. Saturday, according to multiple reports. He reportedly died after hanging himself in his jail cell, despite being on suicide watch, the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0and\u00a0ABC News reported. The disgraced billionaire had been accused in July of multiple sex trafficking charges. The news of Epstein\u2019s suspected suicide comes weeks after prison officials found him unconscious in his jail cell with marks around his neck, indicating a possible suicide attempt. Epstein\u2019s death also follows a move by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York Friday to unseal thousands of documents related to Epstein\u2019s case. The documents alleged some of the inner workings of the operation, \u201cin which Virginia Roberts Guiffre [sic] \u2026 said Epstein forced her to have sex with powerful men, including former Maine Sen. George Mitchell, former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson and Prince Andrew,\u201d Fox Business\u00a0reported.",

      "author": "Haris Alic",
      "content": " The Intercept reported on Friday that Saikat Chakrabarti, the congresswoman\u2019s chief of staff since January, and Corbin Trent, her communications director, would be leaving her congressional office in the next few weeks. Chakrabarti, who masterminded Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s election to Congress, is heading to New Consensus, a nonprofit working to bolster the Green New Deal and other climate change initiatives. The congresswoman\u2019s office said in a statement: Saikat has decided to leave \u2026 to work with New Consensus to further develop plans for a Green New Deal. We are extraordinarily grateful for his service to advance a bold agenda \u2026\u00a0\u00a0Saikat\u2019s goal has always been to do whatever he can to help the larger progressive movement, and we look forward to continuing working with him to do just that. Trent, on the other hand, is transitioning to Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s reelection campaign, which has elicited a number of high-profile challengers. \u201cWith the Ocasio 2020 campaign beginning to ramp up, I\u2019ve asked Corbin to transition to the campaign full-time and he has agreed to do so,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez told The Intercept. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to growing the movement with him in Queens and the Bronx and across the country.\u201d The shakeup comes as the congresswoman\u2019s office has been engulfed in controversy\u00a0since\u00a0Chakrabarti attacked more moderate members of the House majority. In June, Chakrabarti took to social media to\u00a0air\u00a0his frustration with moderate Democrats for forcing Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) to\u00a0abandon\u00a0a\u00a0$4.6 billion emergency border appropriation bill favored by progressives. In a series of tweets, Chakrabarti\u00a0likened\u00a0the moderates to old Southern Democrats, many of whom were avowed segregationists. He stood by the comparison even when\u00a0a progressive activist noted Rep. Sharice Davids (D-KS), the first openly LGBT Native American woman elected to Congress, was one of the moderates that wavered on the bill. \u201cI think the point still stands. I don\u2019t think people have to be personally racist to enable a racist system. And the same could even be said of the Southern Democrats,\u201d Chakrabarti said\u00a0in a now deleted follow-up tweet. \u201cI don\u2019t believe Sharice is a racist person, but her votes are showing her to enable a racist system.\u201d Although Breitbart News\u00a0reported\u00a0on the controversial comments at the time, neither Ocasio-Cortez nor House leadership acknowledged that Chakrabarti may have crossed a line. The situation, though, changed sharply in July when Ocasio-Cortez\u00a0accused\u00a0Pelosi of \u201csingling out newly elected women of color.\u201d After the rebuke, Pelosi\u2019s\u00a0allies\u00a0within the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) moved simultaneously to\u00a0defend\u00a0the Speaker and\u00a0attack\u00a0the freshman congresswoman. A number of the CBC\u2019s members, including Rep. William Lacy Clay (D-MO), directed their anger at both Ocasio-Cortez and her chief of staff. \u201cIt shows you how ignorant and little history [Chakrabarti] knows, how ignorant he is to American history. How dare he,\u201d Clay told The Hill. The Missouri Democrat extended his criticism to Justice Democrats, the group started by Chakrabart to support left-leaning primary challenges to establishment Democrats. \u201cI find it juvenile, their tactics, I find their ignorance to be beyond belief about American history and about who are really segregationists,\u201d Clay said. \u201cAnd so how dare they try to play the race card at this point, it shows you the weakness of their arguments.\u201d Other moderates appeared to echo the sentiment, with some even anonymously calling for Chakrabarti\u2019s ouster.  Even prior to the broadside about moderates, Chakrabarti had come under fire for his tenure leading Justice Democrats. In March, a complaint was filed with the Federal Election Commission claiming he\u00a0funneled\u00a0more than $1 million in political donations to two of his private companies.",

With Kavanaugh sworn\u00a0into the Supreme Court as of Saturday evening, he is the fourth justice to be nominated by a president who did not win the popular vote. President Donald Trump, who beat his Democrat rival Hillary Clinton\u00a0by 77 electoral\u00a0votes (304-227) in the 2016 presidential election, has placed Neil\u00a0Gorsuch\u00a0and\u00a0now\u00a0Kavanaugh\u00a0on the\u00a0court. Both Justice\u00a0Samuel Alito and John Roberts were selected\u00a0by\u00a0President George W. Bush. Ocasio-Cortez joins a growing number of Democrats, including Clinton, calling for the electoral college to be replaced. In a September 2017 interview with CNN, Clinton told host Anderson Cooper that she believed the process was outdated and needed to be replaced.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve moved toward one-person, one-vote, that\u2019s how we select winners,\u201d said Clinton. \u201cI think it needs to be eliminated. I\u2019d like to see us move beyond it, yes.\u201d One year later, Clinton once again called for the electoral college to be eliminated in an opinion-editorial for the Atlantic, arguing President Donald Trump was a racist who was damaging\u00a0American democracy. \u201cYou won\u2019t be surprised to hear that I passionately believe it\u2019s time to abolish the Electoral College,\u201d Clinton wrote.\u00a0\u201cTrump has sunk far below the already-low bar he set for himself in his ugly campaign.\u201d \u201cHate speech isn\u2019t \u2018telling it like it is,\u2019\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s just hate.\u201d",

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who, like Sanders, is running on a platform of sweeping liberal change and who has emphasized her role as a female pioneer,\u201d notes the Post. Ocasio-Cortez\u00a0worked as a\u00a0volunteer\u00a0organizer for\u00a0Sanders\u2019s\u00a02016 campaign. The development comes after Sanders said that he \u201cmisspoke\u201d when he told reporters he may slow his frenetic campaigning pace after a recent heart attack. The Vermont senator backtracked in an interview with NBC News\u00a0just a day after\u00a0indicating that health concerns would force him to change \u201cthe nature\u201d of his campaign, in the short term, at least. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get back into the groove of a very vigorous campaign,\u201d Sanders told NBC, downplaying the impact of the heat attack, which required him to be rushed to the hospital where he received two stents to clear a clogged artery in his heart. \u201cPeople should think that I had a procedure which hundreds of thousands of people a year have,\u201d Sanders continued. \u201cPeople should think that according to the doctors I\u2019m on the way to a full recovery.\u201d The 78-year-old self-described democratic socialist was hospitalized after experiencing chest discomfort while campaigning in Las Vegas last week. His staff initially said the stents were inserted for a blocked artery, revealing only two days later that he had had a heart attack. Sanders told NBC it was \u201cnonsense\u201d to suggest his staff hadn\u2019t been forthright about his condition. He said he was still talking to doctors and trying to understand what was going on.

Where men all have sex with one women. Either at the same time or one after another. Two other non-sexual definitions refer to attacking people in video games. The context of Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s remark was an answer to a question about a fake nude photo, purporting to be of the congresswoman, that appeared on Reddit and was subsequently covered by other outlets, including Vice\u2019s Motherboard, the Daily Caller, and other outlets. Ocasio-Cortez claimed, without evidence, that \u201cRepublicans\u201d and \u201cconservative outlets\u201d had circulated the image. The relevant section of the interview is as follows: The Post: How did you feel when that hit yesterday? Ocasio-Cortez: I was surprised and I was annoyed because it was a new tack. They\u2019ve been for a very long time focusing on taking quotes out of context or manipulating them or making it seem as though I said things that I didn\u2019t say. This was different in that it was an outright fraudulent thing. You can tell that they\u2019re getting into hysterics because now you\u2019re getting into my actual body, which is definitely crossing a level, definitely crossing a line. I also think it\u2019s encouraging because this is my sixth day in Congress and they\u2019re out of all their artillery. The nude is supposed to be like the bazooka. You know, like, \u201cWe\u2019re going to take her down.\u201d Dude, you\u2019re all out of bullets, you\u2019re all out of bombs, you\u2019re all out of all this stuff. What have you got left? I\u2019m six days into the term, and you already used all your ammo. So enjoy being exhausted for the next two years while we run train on the progressive agenda.

Yes. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a question,\u201d the congresswoman told Yahoo News hours after she\u00a0toured\u00a0the detention facilities run by Customs and Border Protection. \u201cIf you actually take the time to study, and to look at the steps, and to see how government transforms under authoritarian regimes, and look at the political decisions and patterns of this president, the answer is yes.\u201d Last month Ocasio-Cortez sparked controversy when she described the migrant detention facilities as \u201cconcentration camps on our southern border.\u201d Her comment drew an immediate backlash from critics who accused her of trivializing Nazi concentration camps, while others, including some Holocaust survivors and scholars, said the comparison was a valid one. The freshman Democratic lawmaker from New York refused to back down from that comparison, and in her conversation with Yahoo News, Ocasio-Cortez argued that many things about President Trump echo that dark period in history. Read the full Yahoo! News article here. Also on Monday evening, National Border Patrol Council president Brandon Judd told\u00a0Breitbart News Tonight that Ocasio-Cortez had lied about conditions at facilities where illegal aliens are being held near the border, as well as about the behavior of officers at the facilities. \u201cHow can you have the moral high ground if you are going to throw facts out the window and spew falsehoods?\u201d he commented. Ocasio-Cortez was elected in November as part of a Democratic Party victory in the U.S. House of Representatives, matching a pattern throughout recent U.S. history in which the opposition fares well in the midterm elections. Since taking office, Ocasio-Cortez has proposed ambitious new policies that grant sweeping powers to the government over the U.S. economy, envisioning a highly controlled system in which the state controls private industry and steers it toward overarching utopian goals, such as a shift to 100% renewable energy and the elimination of fossil fuels.

      "content": " CNN is even trying to explain how Auschwitz wasn\u2019t all that bad. On Monday, Ocasio-Crazy, probably from that luxury apartment of hers, filmed a video that compared American migrant camps to \u201cconcentration camps.\u201d Nevermind that our migrant camps have been in use long before President Trump took office. Nevermind that these illegal migrants enjoy free food, healthcare, and sanitary conditions. Nevermind that if these illegal migrants simply agreed to return home where they belong, we would provide free transportation (translation: they are NOT prisoners). Nevermind that what was perfectly okay under Obama is a concentration camp because Orange Man Bad. Ocasio-Crazy\u2019s comparison is, of course, not only outrageous, it is yet another way to deliberately smear Trump as a Nazi, which is a sure way to embolden violence or an assassination attempt against him. The good news is that Ocasio-Crazy got some well-deserved blowback. Because on top of her mindless stupidity and dangerous rhetoric, there is the not-unimportant matter of her trivializing the Holocaust. Naturally, though, as soon as the backlash began, Ocasio-Crazy did what she usually does in these matters\u2026 She played dumb and lied. \u201cAnd for the shrieking Republicans,\u201d she tweeted on Tuesday, \u201cwho don\u2019t know the difference: concentration camps are not the same as death camps.\u201d In other words: My \u201cconcentration camp\u201d rhetoric had not-a-thang to do with the Holocaust. In fact, I wasn\u2019t even thinking about Nazi Germany and Auschwitz, you deplorable racists. Yeah, no. That\u2019s not only a lie, it\u2019s provable lie, because in her video, Ocasio-Crazy says, \u201c\u2018Never Again\u2019 means something.\u201d The phrase \u201cNever Again\u201d refers directly to the Holocaust, so the fact that she was comparing our migrant camps to the Holocaust is not even debatable, nor is the fact that she is now lying about it. But guess who do see it as debatable, who are making excuses for Ocasio-Crazy\u2019s inexcusable Holocaust comparison and\u00a0 just as inexcusable lies to cover\u00a0 it up? Yep, you guessed it: our useless, dishonest, fake newsers in the establishment media. Here\u2019s CNN\u2019s Manu Raju helping Ocasio-Crazy clean up this mess by allowing her to lie to his stupid face:  Weird how he never asks her to explain that \u201cNever Again\u201d remark, no? Oh, and here\u2019s CNN\u2019s favorite crybully, Andrew Kaczynski, breaking the fake news that Auschwitz wasn\u2019t all that bad: Aushwitz was a mixture of work and extermination camps. \u2014 andrew kaczynski (@KFILE) June 18, 2019  Hey, Kaczynski: Auschwitz also had roads, its own train station, offices, and kitchens\u2026 So Auschwitz was kinda like Six Flags, amiright? Not to be outdone, Dave Weigel, the far-left Washington Post\u2019s lead Democrat fluffer, is pretty sure that a world-class dingbat who just a few weeks ago found herself awed by the miracle of a garbage disposal, must have been referring to the Boer War:  And then there\u2019s MSNBC\u2019s Chris Hayes, who also chose to ignore the \u201cNever Again\u201d remark so he could yell at Liz Cheney: \u201cIf you spend a few minutes learning some actual history,\u201d Hayes harrumphed, \u201cyou will find out that concentration camps are different from death camps and have a history that both predates and extends far past the Nazis.\u201d  Now explain \u201cNever Again,\u201d pajama boy. So what we have here are three national news outlets so desperate to protect Ocasio-Crazy they are ignoring her \u201cNever Again\u201d reference, and we even have one CNN \u201creporter\u201d breaking the bombshell news that Auschwitz was nowhere near as bad as advertised. Is it just me or does this all qualify as \u201cenemy-of-the-people\u201d type behavior? Anyway, this has been today\u2019s episode of Democrats Sure Got It Good.

      "subtitle": "It can be painful to watch the government, media, and left lead America\u2019s young people, most especially millennials, astray. On top of being brainwashed into humorless censors and joyless puritans, the debt they are pressured to take on is beyond belief.",
      "author": "John Nolte",
      "content": " To begin with, there is college tuition. I graduated high school in 1984 (barely), and even during those saner times, when tuition was much more reasonable, I had no desire to go to college, primarily due to the cost. The idea of enslaving myself to a monthly payment before I even had the chance to be young and free was intolerable. Nowadays, though, tuition costs are not only insane, a number of degrees that once required four years of study, now require five. Talk about a scam. How sad to be in your early to mid-20s and already saddled with a six-figure debt. \u00a0It is even sadder if you hold a degree that will do you no good in the real world. And the entire American establishment is engineered to convince teenagers to jump into this financial abyss, but only because the entire American establishment benefits. In college, kids are politically brainwashed, which is why post-college, they are more likely than not to vote Democrat \u2014 to vote for a bigger and more intrusive government, to relish the idea of centralized control. As far as the insatiable tuition train, this is what funds these greedy left-wing universities and their staff. And then it all comes together when the crushing debt combined with the brainwashing radicalizes young people into believing government-subsidized anything (tuition, healthcare) has to be better than this. Obviously, though, that crushing misery is not enough for far-leftists like incoming Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), who is pressuring her fellow millennials to sign up for the con game that is Obamacare. In a tweet Monday, Ocasio-Cortez wrote: \u201cReminder to my fellow millennials to get your act together & buy insurance before tonight\u2019s deadline.\u201d \u201cIs open enrollment a pain? Yes. Is it expensive? Yes. But it\u2019s WAY better than being uninsured (been there) & reason enough to fight for #MedicareForAll.\u201d  At least she doesn\u2019t hide the true agenda behind Obamacare \u2014 t0 make health insurance so expensive people beg to put centralized government in charge of our health. Regardless, shame on her. Obamacare is nothing less than a con job that sucks young people dry for no valid reason. The young and healthy do need health insurance, much less the utterly useless insurance that is Obamacare. Not only are Obamacare\u2019s monthly premiums obnoxiously expensive (upwards of $1,000), so are the deductibles. The chances a young person will meet the deductible are extremely low, which means that on top of paying that crippling Obamacare premium, young people are paying for their own healthcare. Obamacare is only about wealth redistribution, to saddle the young and healthy with massive monthly premiums as a means to lower premiums for the old and sick. Originally, through the fascist mandate, the government forced you to buy health insurance. With the repeal of the mandate, you now have con artists like Ocasio-Cortez guilting and misleading young people into paying for a product they do not need. \u201c[I]t\u2019s WAY better than being uninsured.\u201d No, no, it is actually not \u201cWAY better than being uninsured.\u201d Being uninsured is WAY better because you are almost certainly going to waste thousands of dollars a year on a product you do not need. And it is worth repeating that on top of that, thanks to the deductible, you will also end up paying for whatever health care you do get. Of course there is always the unlikely (especially for the young) catastrophic situation \u2014 a cancer, heart attack, or car accident. If that is a concern, you can either look into a catastrophic health insurance plan (low monthly premium with a very high deductible) or take the risk. Me? I\u2019d take the risk, and I have taken the risk. After Obamacare outlawed my health insurance, as a grown man in my 40s, I took the risk for years. \u00a0These days, I have this as a catastrophic backup, but I still pay for all of my own healthcare out of pocket, which is a helluva lot cheaper than Obamacare. Sorry, but there is just no way I\u2019m going to allow the government to con or pressure me into paying for a lousy product I don\u2019t need. Wise up, millennails, you\u2019re not only being hoodwinked, you\u2019re being stripped of the joy and freedom that is supposed to come with being young. This country would be a lot better off if millennials stopped paying their Obamacare premiums and used that money instead to fund a wild, drunken toga party \u2014 complete with a live band and strippers. In fact, we should all do that.  Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC. Follow his Facebook Page here.",

Despite House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s (D-CA) efforts to stall the probe, she claims the party is united. \u201cI think you should characterize it [the resolution] for what it is,\u201d Pelosi\u00a0told\u00a0Fox News. \u201cIt\u2019s a continuation of what we have been doing. You know,\u00a0we all work together on these things.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez began calling for Trump\u2019s impeachment prior to taking office, telling\u00a0Real America with Jorge Ramos\u00a0last fall that impeachment was a \u201cno-brainer.\u201d The freshman lawmaker renewed her calls for impeachment over the weekend following reports of an inquiry into military spending associated with Trump\u2019s Turnberry resort: ",

Will Hurd\u2019s (R-TX) decision not to\u00a0seek reelection, leaving the 23rd Congressional District of Texas wide open. \u201cI have made the decision to not seek reelection for the 23rd Congressional District of Texas in order to pursue opportunities outside the halls of Congress to solve problems at the nexus between technology and national security,\u201d he wrote:  It is a tight district, as Hurd narrowly edged out Democrat challenger Gina Ortiz Jones in 2018, winning by less than one percent. Republican Texas Reps. Pete Olson and Mike Conaway also recently announced they will not seek reelection, sparking Democrat hopes of a series of congressional upsets in 2020:     Some, such as former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (D), believe Texas will be in play in the general election as well:  President Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in Texas by 9 points\u2013 52.2 percent to 43.2 percent. The current Real Clear Politics averages of hypothetical Texas general election matchups show Trump beating every candidate except for Joe Biden (D), who is up by 2.5 percent. As Breitbart News reported last month, the GOP is beefing up resources in Texas to prevent the blue shift Ocasio-Cortez and her counterparts predict: Donors are reportedly strengthening efforts in the state and primarily focusing on GOP voter registration efforts. The broad goal involves registering at least one million new Republican voters ahead of 2020. One specific group, Engage Texas, led by\u00a0Houston real estate developer\u00a0Richard Weekley, hopes to raise millions ahead of the presidential election. According to reports\u00a0from\u00a0the\u00a0Washington Examiner, Engage Texas was \u201cset up as a 501(c)4, political nonprofit organization and plans to raise and spend $25 million by Election Day next year.\u201d \u201cWithout our 38 electoral votes, no Republican candidate has a path to victory for the foreseeable future. That is why we are asking for the support of people around the country,\u201d Republican Party of Texas chairman James Dickey told\u00a0Breitbart Washington editor Matt Boyle on Sirius XM\u2019s\u00a0Breitbart News Saturday in April. \u201cOne of the things that we face as a challenge in Texas is people assume that Texas always has been and always will be red. That\u2019s not true. It was only 16 years ago that Republicans even took the Texas House,\u201d he continued. \u201cDemocrats have been pouring money and pouring resources into Texas to try and flip Texas,\u201d Dickey added.",

During another part of the live-stream, the 29-year-old freshman lawmaker warned her followers that \u201cwe are losing to an authoritarian and\u00a0fascist presidency.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t use those words lightly,\u201d she continued. \u201cI don\u2019t use those words to just throw bombs.\u00a0I use that word because that is what an administration that creates concentration camps is.

And it isn\u2019t for those fleeing violence in Central America.\u201d   Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s remarks came as\u00a0President Trump vowed to deport millions of illegal aliens in a series of tweets. Ahead of launching his 2020 re-election campaign, the president stated that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) will next week \u201cbegin the process of removing the millions of illegal aliens who have illicitly found their way into the United States.\u201d \u201cThey will be removed as fast as they come in,\u201d he added.

      "content": " The not-terribly-bright socialist was caught on video Friday patronizing the mostly black audience with a fake southern drawl at Rev. Al Sharpton\u2019s National Action Network conference. The humiliating video quickly made the rounds on social media, earning the criticism and ridicule it deserved. The video is as shocking as it is excruciating. All of a sudden, the Westchester socialist, who is famous for her Jerry the Mouse voice, starts talking like a black preacher. \u201cThis is what organizing looks like. This is what building power looks like,\u201d\u00a0Ocasio-Crazy said with her affected cadence. \u201cThis is what changing the country looks like. It\u2019s when we choose to show up and occupy the room and talk about the things that matter most, talking about our future.\u201d \u201cAin\u2019t nothing wrong with that. There\u2019s nothing wrong with working retail, folding clothes for other people to buy,\u201d she continued. \u201cThere is nothing wrong with preparing the food that your neighbors will eat. There is nothing wrong with driving the buses that take your family to work\u201d:  The moment is reminiscent of two-time presidential loser Hillary \u201cHot Sauce\u201d Clinton\u2019s similar attempt to condescend to a predominantly black audience with her \u201cAin\u2019t No Ways Tired\u201d remarks in 2007:  And let\u2019s not forget then-Vice President Joe \u201cThe Hair Sniffer\u201d Biden warning a black audience that Mitt Romney\u2019s going \u201cto put y\u2019all back in chains\u201d:  \u201cAin\u2019t.\u201d \u201cY\u2019all.\u201d More like\u2026 \u201cPhony.\u201d \u201cFreak.\u201d Anyway, using the Twitters, Ocasio-CowFart basically melted down over the ridicule, using the absurd argument that this is how Alex from The Block does her thang, and if you were from The Block, you\u2019d know that\u2019s how a thang is done, and y\u2019all need to forget Miss Thang grew up in, ahem, Westchester:  \u201cFolks talking about my voice can step right off,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cWomen\u2019s March & Kavanaugh speech, same. Any kid who grew up in a distinct linguistic culture & had to learn to navigate class enviros at school/work knows what\u2019s up. My Spanish is the same way.\u201d What a load of crap. Even though, at the time, I was younger than she is (she\u2019s currently 29 going on 14), I \u00a0managed to live, work, and go to school in Milwaukee\u2019s inner city for a total of five years. My whole \u201cclass enviro\u201d during those years was predominantly black, but the thought of affecting an accent never even crossed my mind \u2014 not because I was woke or sensitive, but because I didn\u2019t want to look like an asshole \u2014 because this is what Ocasio-Crazy looks like (NSFW):  What\u2019s more, she\u2019s lying\u2026 As Ryan Saavedra at the Daily Wire discovered, her claim that this is not the first time she\u2019s used a \u201cdistinct dialect,\u201d that she did the same during her \u201cWomen\u2019s March & Kavanaugh speech,\u201d simply isn\u2019t true. Below is video\u00a0footage of those two speeches, and all you hear is Jerry the Mouse:   In a second tweet, she lied again. \u201cAs much as the right wants to distort & deflect, I am from the Bronx. I act & talk like it, *especially* when I\u2019m fired up and especially when I\u2019m home,\u201d she tweeted. Except she\u2019s not from the Bronx. She\u2019s from Westchester. \u201cIt is so hurtful to see how every aspect of my life is weaponized against me, yet somehow asserted as false at the same time,\u201d she added, as though it wasn\u2019t hurtful for us to have to watch her patronize a mostly black audience as though they were babies who require baby talk.

The FEC complaint also alleged that Ocasio-Cortez and Chakrabarti created a limited liability company (LLC) to go around federal expenditure requirements, offering political consulting services to Ocasio-Cortez and other Democratic candidates at extremely low prices. Chakrabarti\u2019s group, Brand New Congress LLC, took on Ocasio-Cortez as a client and charged those clients \u201cfar below market value\u201d while using PAC money to subsidize the company\u2019s losses, according to the complaint. Dan Backer, a conservative attorney, filed the FEC complaint alleging that Ocasio-Cortez and Chakrabarti violated a group of FEC Advisory Opinions in place since the 1990s which state that campaigns have to pay full price for political consulting services or accept them as contributions. This is not the first FEC complaint filed against Ocasio-Cortez recently. The National Legal and Policy Center (NLPC) filed an FEC complaint against\u00a0Chakrabarti for allegedly using two different PACs to funnel $1 million to two private companies he owned to hide campaign finance expenditures.",

The 29-year-old congresswoman started off by saying that age often is used \u201cas a proxy\u201d for capacit, and there were certainly \u201csome folks of a certain age where you could question their capacity.\u201d When pressed, Ocasio-Cortez cited Trump was \u201ca perfect example,\u201d but admitted Biden\u2019s performance at the debate cast doubt on his own \u201ccapacity\u201d to be president. \u201cI think Joe Biden, his performance on the stage, kind of raised some questions in respect to that,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to say just because someone is 79, they can\u2019t or shouldn\u2019t run for president. I don\u2019t want to\u2026 use a number as a proxy for capacity.\u201d Remnick asked what it was about Biden that made Ocasio-Cortez think he was \u201cnot there\u201d and how progressives \u201cshould behave\u201d if the former vice president or any other centrist Democrat were to win the nomination. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about being centrist per se,\u201d the congresswoman responded. \u201cWhen you are struggling to talk about segregationists and you air on the side of discussing them in glowing terms, that is a big problem.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez went on to say Biden, who recently\u00a0flip-flopped\u00a0on the Hyde Amendment and has been accused by multiple females of\u00a0unwanted touching, appeared to have \u201csystemic\u201d problems with women. \u201cI think struggling and talking about women\u2019s rights is a big issue,\u201d she said. \u201cStruggling to convey respect for women in this day and age is a big issue. I think those are systemic issues, those are very deep, those are not gaffes, they are problems.\u201d At the Democrat debate last month, Biden was confronted\u00a0by Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) for having recently\u00a0praised\u00a0segregationists and long opposing\u00a0busing\u00a0to integrate public schools. \u201cI agree with you when you commit yourself to the importance of finding common ground,\u201d Harris said, \u201cbut I also believe and it\u2019s personal and it was hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built their reputations and career on the segregation of race in this country.\u201d Harris also criticized Biden for opposing busing to integrate public schools for the majority of his career in public office. \u201cIt was not only that, but you also worked with them to oppose busing,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools and she was bussed to school every day. That little girl was me. So I will tell you that on this subject, it cannot be an intellectual debate\u2026 we have to take it seriously.\u201d Biden tried to defend himself by claiming Harris had mischaracterized his record. Instead of providing evidence to dispute Harris\u2019s indictment, the former vice president only muddled\u00a0his position on\u00a0busing\u00a0and inaccurately claimed that he never offered\u00a0praised\u00a0for racists. After the debate, Biden\u2019s team was reportedly \u201cfreaking out\u201d about the his poor performance. Biden\u2019s team appeared to be correct to worry. Most political observers seemed to agree that Biden\u00a0underperformed\u00a0and was caught off the guard by Harris\u2019s criticism.",

To me, it\u2019s a no-brainer,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez replied to Ramos. \u201cWell, I believe that he has violated the law. Violated potentially many laws, whether it\u2019s the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution because he keeps his businesses open that foreign actors kind of participate in financial transactions with. Whether it\u2019s what we are seeing with potentially illegal buyouts of campaign, you know, FEC violations of women that he is trying to silence.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez also said impeaching Trump should not be \u201cbeyond the pale\u201d because of how Republicans impeached former President Bill Clinton for lying under oath. \u201cBut overall, you look at the bar that the Republicans held for impeaching Bill Clinton and somehow impeaching Donald Trump is supposed to be beyond the pale? It seems ridiculous to me,\u201d she added. Though Ocasio-Cortez said she believes Trump should be impeached because he committed a crime, other Democrats like Rep. Al Green (D-TX) have insisted that Trump \u201cdoes not have to commit a crime to be impeached.\u201d In fact, Green has argued that Trump could be impeached simply for \u201charming society.\u201d \u201cIn fact, the president is not likely to be indicted, which means he\u2019s not likely to be found guilty of a crime while he\u2019s sitting, which means that if this comes before the House, it won\u2019t come before the House as a president who has been found guilty, but rather as a president who is alleged to have committed certain offenses that are onerous to the Constitution and that harm society,\u201d Green said during an August Democracy Now interview. \u201cAnd what this president is doing is harming society.\u201d Top Democrats like House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), aware that impeachment is not a popular issue among Americans, has previously said that talk of impeachment before the midterms would be a \u201cgift\u201d to Republicans. But left-wing Democrats like Ocasio-Cortez, egged on by the party\u2019s left-wing base that may not settle for anything less than impeachment if Democrats take back the House, have been ignoring Pelosi\u2019s warnings to be disciplined and not talk about impeachment before Special Counsel Robert Mueller concludes his investigation.",

Although Ocasio-Cortez and other Democrats have strongly condemned the Trump administration for going after people who stay in the country illegally, their rhetoric did not match up to the reality of Trump\u2019s plan on border enforcement. Trump announced later on Saturday that he would be delaying the administration\u2019s effort to deport more illegal aliens until both political parties can work out a bipartisan solution to solve the problems at the southern border.",

      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " The New York lawmaker has been under fire for describing migrant detention centers as concentration camps and using phrases \u2013 like \u201cNever Again\u201d \u2013 commonly associated with the Holocaust. Despite the political backlash, she is not backing down. On Sunday, she wrote: Remember when the Bush administration bullied media into using their devised term \u201cenhanced interrogation\u201d instead of the accurate term \u201ctorture?\u201d Well, waterboarding was torture. And these are concentration camps. Journalism should be about the truth. And this is the truth. The tweet was in reference to an ABC News report featuring a physician,\u00a0Dolly Lucio Sevier, who witnessed a migrant detention center in person. She compared the conditions to \u201ctorture facilities\u201d and described it as \u201cworse than jail.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez seemed to agree with the general assessment. Sevier had access to the Ursula facility in McAllen and wrote, \u201cThe conditions within which they are held could be compared to torture facilities,\u201d ABC News reported. ABC News added:  After assessing 39 children under the age of 18, she described conditions for unaccompanied minors at the\u00a0McAllen facility\u00a0as including \u201cextreme cold temperatures, lights on 24 hours a day, no adequate access to medical care, basic sanitation, water, or adequate food.\u201d All the children who were seen showed evidence of trauma, Lucio Sevier reported, and the teens spoke of having no access to hand washing during their entire time in custody. She compared it to being \u201ctantamount to intentionally causing the spread of disease.\u201d In an interview with ABC News, Lucio Sevier said the facility \u201cfelt worse than jail.\u201d The report did not address the trauma that children experienced on their journey to the U.S.-Mexico border. Many enter facilities with existing physical and emotional issues \u2013 issues not created by the facility itself. More than 5,000 migrants were quarantined due to exposure to mumps and chicken pox in June alone. As Breitbart News reported:  And the immigrants are not the only ones affected \u2014 border officials are suffering too. \u201cTheir morale is impacted. They\u2019re tired. A lot of them have gotten sick. They\u2019ve been exposed to flu, chicken pox, measles, mumps \u2014 all kinds of challenges in terms of the medical care,\u201d Acting Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kevin McAleenan said. \u201cThey\u2019re spending time overnight in hospitals instead of patrolling the border.\u201d Overcrowding is a massive issue. In May, the Department of Homeland Security inspector general found\u00a0\u201cdangerous overcrowding\u201d at the\u00a0El Paso Del Norte Processing Center, particularly. \u201cBorder Patrol agents told us some of the detainees had been held in standing-room-only conditions for days or weeks,\u201d\u00a0the office of inspector general concluded. Breitbart News also\u00a0reported\u00a0that \u201can inspection of the facility revealed that a cell with a maximum capacity of 12 people held 76, one with a maximum capacity of eight held 41 and one with a maximum capacity of 35 held 155 people.\u201d Additionally, Breitbart News\u00a0highlighted\u00a0that facilities in the Rio Grande Valley Sector of South Texas were holding an average of 8,000 migrants per day. The overflow was so massive that Border Patrol requested\u00a0the construction of temporary shelters and began flying migrants to other processing centers in Del Rio, Texas. The GOP is placing much of the blame squarely on Democrats in Congress, who refuse to provide funding for additional bed space and other essential resources that would improve conditions. \u201cWe\u2019re doing a lot with what the Congress has given us, but again Congress refused to increase the bed space in the last appropriations bill,\u201d Vice President Mike Pence told\u00a0Face the Nation Sunday. \u201cThey continue to delay efforts on additional humanitarian support,\u201d he continued. On Saturday, Ocasio-Cortez accused the GOP of supporting the construction of \u201cmass concentration camps on the southern border.\u201d \u201cReminder this admin is CHOOSING to round up refugees seeking asylum, fighting to not give children toothpaste or soap & making people sleep on dirt floors,\u201d she tweeted, confirming the left\u2019s position on withholding money that could improve conditions of the overcrowded facilities. \u201cThey say it\u2019s bc of a lack of money,\u201d she wrote. \u201cYou know what saves money? Not putting masses of people in internment in the first place\u201d:  ",

      "author": "Joshua Caplan",
      "content": " \u201cWell, you know, the president is from Queens, and with all due respect \u2014 half of my district is from Queens \u2014 I don\u2019t think he knows how to deal with a girl from the Bronx,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said this week on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. She similarly told the Washington Post: \u201cI wasn\u2019t born to a wealthy or powerful family \u2014 mother from Puerto Rico, dad from the South Bronx. I was born in a place where your Zip code determines your destiny.\u201d The congressional candidate, who pulled off an upset win against high-ranking establishment Rep. Joe Crowley (D-NY), was indeed born in New York City\u2019s Bronx borough. She currently lives there, too. So what\u2019s the issue? Ocasio-Cortez omits that for most of her formative years, she was actually raised in one of the United States\u2019 wealthiest counties. Around the age of five, Alexandria\u2019s architect father\u00a0Sergio Ocasio moved the family from the \u201cplanned community\u201d of Parkchester in the Bronx to a home in Yorktown Heights, a wealthy suburb in\u00a0Westchester County. The New York Times describes her childhood home as \u201ca modest two-bedroom house on a quiet street.\u201d In a 1999\u00a0profile of the area, when Ocasio-Cortez would have been ten years old, the Times\u00a0lauded Yorktown Heights\u2019 \u201cdiversity of housing in a scenic setting\u201d \u2013 complete with two golf courses. The paper quoted\u00a0Linda Cooper, the town supervisor, describing Yorktown as \u201da folksy area where people can come, kick off their shoes, wander around, sit in a cafe, listen to a concert in the park, or go to the theater.\u201d In a fun coincidence, Yorktown, which contains Yorktown Heights, is also home to a 436-acre state park named after \u2013 yes, one Donald J. Trump. After high school,\u00a0Ocasio-Cortez studied international relations and economics at\u00a0Boston University and worked for Sen.\u00a0Edward M. Kennedy (D-MA). Only after college did\u00a0Ocasio-Cortez return to the Parkchester complex, where she launched\u00a0Brook Avenue Press, a publishing\u00a0group aimed at improving the public image of the Bronx. Westchester County \u2013 which the\u00a0Washington Post,\u00a0in a glowing profile on Ocasio-Cortez, describes as only \u201cmiddle class\u201d \u2013\u00a0ranks #8 in the nation for the counties with the \u201chighest average incomes among the wealthiest one percent of residents.\u201d According to the\u00a0Economic Policy Institute, the county\u2019s average annual income of the top one percent is a staggering $4,326,049. Yorktown Heights, specifically, offers a sharp contrast from Bronx living. According to USA.com, the town\u2019s population is 81 percent white, and\u00a0median household income is $96,413 \u2013 nearly double the average for both New York state and the nation, according to data from 2010-2014. The 28-year-old\u2019s far-left platform includes abolishing ICE, universal guaranteed employment, and Medicare for all. In an interview with CNN,\u00a0Ocasio-Cortez said she supports impeaching President Trump, despite warnings from Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) to avoid the issue.",

      "author": "John Binder",
      "content": " Last week,\u00a0Ocasio delivered an upset to establishment Democratic power player\u00a0Rep. Joe Crowley (D-NY) in the district\u2019s primary election, running on a platform that\u00a0promises\u00a0to abolish all immigration and border enforcement. Now, in an interview with AJ+, owned by the Al Jazeera Media Network, Ocasio says that not only should the U.S. abolish the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency \u2014 which is tasked with enforcing interior immigration laws \u2014 but that foreign nationals, border crossers, and illegal aliens\u00a0are entitled to enter the U.S. Ocasio said: I think that immigration should be safe. I think that we should grant people a safe and documented right of passage. Republicans try all these scare tactics. And they go \u2018Oh, open borders.\u2019 Because they\u2019re trying to incite fear. But what we really need to do is demilitarize a lot of what\u2019s going on in terms of the detention of people, which has been happening for a very long time by the way. [Emphasis added] So I think that when we talk about replacing it with a system, we talk about having a system that is safe, that documents people effectively, that is also not rooted in the discrimination that our immigration system was initially built on. [Emphasis added] The first immigration law in the United States was the Chinese Exclusion Act. The first law about immigration in the United States was about how do we exclude a specific type of people. And our immigration system has really kind of evolved from that initial root and I don\u2019t think it necessarily has to be that way. [Emphasis added]  Ocasio is increasingly shaping the Democratic Party\u2019s open borders platform ahead of the 2018 midterm elections. Since her beating of Crowley in the Bronx,\u00a0Democrats\u00a0in the House and Senate, along with progressive liberals like\u00a0Cynthia Nixon\u00a0in New York, have been demanding ICE be abolished and all immigration enforcement be ended. House Democrats are now\u00a0crafting\u00a0legislation that would officially abolish ICE, while Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) has been purged from the Democratic party for failing to endorse the \u201cabolish ICE\u201d campaign like his fellow left-wingers such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). The latest Harvard/Harris\u00a0Poll, though, reveals that swing voters are overwhelmingly opposed to the Democrats\u2019 plan to end all immigration enforcement across the U.S. Nearly 3-in-4 swing voters, about 73 percent, said they do not want ICE to be disbanded, as Breitbart News reported. Less than 30 percent of swing voters said they support the abolishment of ICE. Even Democrat voters are opposed to the abolishment of ICE.\u00a0Nearly 60 percent of Democrats said they do not want ICE to be disbanded. Abolishing the deportation agency, as\u00a0Breitbart News\u00a0reported, would have allowed more than 1.6 million illegal aliens to have gone free throughout the U.S. in the last five years.

      "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
      "content": " Her victory is a further sign of the Democratic Party\u2019s slide toward the extreme left \u2014 and toward the anti-Israel left in particular. During her primary election, Ocasio-Cortez tweeted passionately about an alleged Israeli \u201cmassacre\u201d of Palestinian \u201cprotesters\u201d at the Gaza border, citing an Al Jazeera article.  But those killed at the Gaza border were not \u201cprotesters.\u201d The vast majority \u2014 50 of 62 \u2014 were members of Hamas, a terrorist organization devoted to the destruction of Israel and the murder of Jews. They were not demonstrating against Israel. They were attempting to breach the border so they could carry out attacks against Israeli civilians. Far from carrying out a \u201cmassacre,\u201d Israeli forces showed extraordinary restraint, using pinpoint attacks to target the terrorists and avoid hitting the many human shields \u2014 including children \u2014 that Hamas marched to the fence. In the event, the so-called \u201cpeaceful\u201d protesters set fire to Israeli fields nearby using kites equipped with explosives. Ocasio-Cortez brought up the Gaza deaths again after a debate with a Crowley surrogate who claimed \u2014 bizarrely \u2014 that the incumbent supported the move of the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. (Like every other Democrat, Crowley failed to show up for the event, or for a party held to celebrate it in Washington, D.C.) That was too much for Ocasio-Cortez, who not only opposed the embassy move but also cited the Hamas dead in doing so:  The Jewish radicals of J Street will, no doubt, be thrilled to have another member of Congress who supports Hamas over Israel, and will rush to her defense. But for the few Democrats who still support Israel, her victory is worrying. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s anti-Israel views are of a piece with her radical policies in general \u2014 such as government health care for all, free college tuition, guaranteed federal jobs, and abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). (At least she is consistent: she does not believe in a border fence with Gaza or a border wall with Mexico.)\u00a0Her campaign even adopted the zombie-like \u201cmic check\u201d first seen at radical Occupy Wall Street protests in 2011. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s anti-Israel views, like her other socialist policies, are ill-informed and would have devastating consequences if enacted. She is not stupid: far from it, the Boston University graduate is whip-smart. But like other far-left millennials, she has mastered the finer details of a fictional universe. These are positions she will not easily walk back. Her victory has thrilled the Democratic base, but it spells trouble for the party, and for the country. Joel B.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) on Monday evening after she made incendiary claims about her visit earlier that day to several U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) sites housing migrants who crossed the U.S. border illegally.",
      "author": "Breitbart Texas",
      "content": " Ocasio-Cortez, who continues to refer to CBP facilities as \u201cconcentration camps\u201d despite being criticized by Jewish leaders, the U.S. Holocaust Museum, and Israel\u2019s Yad Vashem, tweeted that women had been forced to drink water from toilets, among other atrocities:     Judd, whose union represents U.S. Border Patrol agents, spoke to Breitbart News\u2019 Rebecca Mansour and Joel Pollak on Breitbart News Tonight on SiriusXM. He was furious at Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s claims, and pushed back passionately. He said that cameras that film the facilities would show that Ocasio-Cortez was lying: \u201cI\u2019m calling on CBP to release that footage so they clearly show that she was treated with the utmost dignity and respect,\u201d Judd said. \u201cNobody is forced to drink out of a toilet and nobody is told to drink out of a toilet,\u201d Judd explained. \u201cIts completely and totally a baseless and ridiculous allegation and frankly it needs to be investigated and she needs to be exposed.\u201d  Other reports suggested that Ocasio-Cortez had actually been rude and confrontational toward law enforcement personnel, and had misinterpreted or misrepresented information she learned. The\u00a0Washington Examiner specifically disputed Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s claims about a woman, or women, being forced to drink from a toilet. During the interview with Breitbart New Tonight, Judd mentioned a previous statement by Ocasio-Cortez in which she stated that she would rather be morally correct than factually accurate. Judd disagreed. \u201cHow can you have the moral high ground if you are going to throw facts out the window and spew falsehoods?\u201d he asked, adding: \u201cAnd that\u2019s what she is doing.\u201d He continued, \u201cShe gives absolutely no contexts to these allegations that she is making and by not giving context she is trying to paint a false narrative and a false picture and she needs to be held accountable for that.\u201d During the interview, Judd said Ocasio-Cortez was misleading the nation by painting a false picture of agents. When asked about Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s claim that migrants were subjected to \u201cpsychological warfare\u201d by agents who would wake them at odd hours and call them derogative names, Judd said, \u201cWhere is the proof? It\u2019s very easy to throw out these allegations and say this is what\u2019s happening.\u201d Judd continued: \u201cLet the cameras speak \u2026The cameras will prove her wrong and they will prove that she is being false.\u201d Breitbart News Tonight broadcasts live on the SiriusXM Patriot channel 125 weeknights from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern, or 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Pacific.",

      "content": " Last Monday evening, Ocasio-Cortez compared detention facilities for illegal aliens caught crossing the U.S.-Mexico border to \u201cconcentration camps,\u201d adding the phrase \u201cnever again,\u201d which commonly refers to the Nazi Holocaust. The remark drew outrage and criticism, even from fellow Democrats. Nevertheless, Ocasio-Cortez doubled down, first claiming that she had not been referring to Nazi Germany, then drawing parallels to the U.S. internment of Japanese-Americans during the Second World War. \u201cI will never apologize for calling these camps what they are,\u201d she tweeted. Alan Dershowitz, who recently said he would support Joe Biden over President Donald Trump in 2020, said Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s \u201cconcentration camp\u201d claim made her a \u201cHolocaust denier.\u201d Bill Maher, host of HBO\u2019s\u00a0Real Time\u00a0with Bill Maher, and a determined foe of President Trump, criticized her on his show Friday evening: \u201cIf you want to run a campaign based on reparations and concentration camps then it\u2019s going to be very hard to win the election.\u201d Rabbi Shmuley Boteach (who is also a Breitbart News contributor) published a full-page ad in the\u00a0New York Times:  Numerous Holocaust educational foundations, including Israel\u2019s Yad Vashem, offered to educate Ocasio-Cortez. Senior Yad Vashem historian Robert Rozett wrote in response to Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s use of the term \u201cconcentration camp\u201d: The term \u201cconcentration camps\u201d has become a commonly used term for an array of Nazi camps all characterized by profound inhumanity and suffering. Even Auschwitz-Birkenau \u2013 the most infamous of the Nazi camps where more than one million people were murdered\u2013 was officially termed a Konzentrationslager (Concentration camp) in German. One group, From the Depths, issued an open invitation Friday for Ocasio-Cortez to join it on a tour of Holocaust sites: We at From The Depths, would like to invite you as our guest during your summer recess from The United Congress, to join us along with Holocaust Survivor, United States Citizen and President of From The Depths, Mr. Edward Mosberg on an educational tour, specifically built for legislators, of the German Nazi Concentration Camps. The educational tour will visit Mauthausen, Auschwitz-Birkenau and Majdanek Concentration Camps, amongst many other educational sites. But Ocasio-Cortez refused the invitation, citing the fact that Rep. Steve King (R-IA) had been on a similar tour:  King was rebuked by the U.S. House of Representatives earlier this year for appearing to support white supremacy. The Washington Post reported last year that he had met with a far-right Austrian group after completing his tour of Holocaust sites with From the Depths, which denied any knowledge of his subsequent travel plans in Europe. In May, President Donald Trump sent the first-ever official U.S. government delegation to the March of the Living, an annual march between Auschwitz and the Birkenau death camp nearby that commemorates victims of the Holocaust.

But she kept doubling down and digging in, first insisting the detention camps met the definition of \u201cconcentration camps\u201d; then trying to draw a distinction between \u201cconcentration camps\u201d and \u201cdeath camps\u201d; then arguing that the U.S. had also used \u201cconcentration camps\u201d when President Franklin Delano Roosevelt (a Democrat) interned Japanese-Americans during the Second World War. She also spent hours retweeting supportive messages from those on the left who attempted to defend her use of the \u201cconcentration camp\u201d analogy.

John Avlon \u2014 no friend of President Donald Trump \u2014 said that Ocasio-Cortez had gone \u201cacross the line,\u201d adding: \u201cIt\u2019s not that hard to apologize. she should do it. It\u2019s unacceptable.\u201d House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (D-CA) likewise said that she should apologize. Ocasio-Cortez tweeted, apparently in response, that she would never apologize:  Ocasio-Cortez also thanked House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) for arguing that the phrase \u201cnever again\u201d could be interpreted more broadly. (Nadler told Breitbart News in 2016 that Democrats who used antisemitism to attack Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) should be fired.) On Wednesday morning, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) refused to condemn Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s statement. It was the second time in recent weeks that she has had to defend a member of her caucus accused of antisemitism: she also protected Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) after repeated antisemitic remarks. Joel B.

Joe Crowley (D-NY), a member of the party\u2019s leadership team under Pelosi, in last year\u2019s primary race. The latest spat began on Saturday, when columnist Maureen Dowd of the\u00a0New York Times reported that Pelosi had disparaged AOC and her allies on the left (original links): I asked Pelosi whether, after being the subject of so many you-go-girl memes for literally clapping back at Trump, it was jarring to get a bad headline like the one in HuffPost that day \u2014 \u201cWhat The Hell Is Nancy Pelosi Doing?\u201d The article described the outrage of the Squad, as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts are known. Pelosi feels that the four made themselves irrelevant to the process by voting against \u201cour bill,\u201d as she put it, which she felt was the strongest one she could get. \u201cAll these people have their public whatever and their Twitter world,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they didn\u2019t have any following. They\u2019re four people and that\u2019s how many votes they got.\u201d AOC responded on Twitter by calling out Pelosi for her past efforts to disparage the party\u2019s \u201cdemocratic socialist\u201d wing:  On Wednesday, Pelosi held a meeting with her caucus in which she reportedly insisted on party unity, and discouraged House members from tweeting criticisms of each other or the leadership. Asked by reporters whether she regretted criticizing AOC in public, Pelosi said: \u201cRegrets is [sic] not what I do.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez did not tweet. But she did talk to the\u00a0Washington Post, the newspaper of record in the capital city: \u201cWhen these comments first started, I kind of thought that she was keeping the progressive flank at more of an arm\u2019s distance in order to protect more moderate members, which I understood,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez told The Washington Post. \u201cBut the persistent singling out .\u2009.\u2009.\u00a0it got to a point where it was just outright disrespectful .\u2009.\u2009. the explicit singling out of newly elected women of color.\u201d The\u00a0Post noted that even though Pelosi had posed with AOC and other \u201cJustice Democrats\u201d on the cover of Rolling Stone earlier this year, the two have not spoken \u201cone-on-one\u201d since February.  Pelosi was apparently upset that Ocasio-Cortez had declined to serve on a select committee on climate change, preferring to launch her own \u201cGreen New Deal.\u201d Joel B.

She ran in 2018 on a pledge to end the war in Syria and elsewhere: \u201cAlexandria believes that we must end the \u201cforever war\u201d by bringing our troops home, and ending the air strikes that perpetuate the cycle of terrorism throughout the world,\u201d her 2018 campaign website\u00a0said: Since the invasion of Iraq in 2003, the United States has entangled itself in war and occupation throughout the Middle East and North Africa. As of 2018, we are currently involved in military action in Libya, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen, Pakistan, and Somalia. Hundreds of thousands of civilians in these countries have been killed either as collateral damage from American strikes or from the instability caused by U.S. interventions. Millions more have fled their broken countries, contributing to the global refugee crisis.\n\n\u2026 According to the Constitution, the right to declare war belongs to the legislative body, and yet many of these global acts of aggression have never once been voted on by Congress. In some cases, we\u2019ve even acted unilaterally, without the backing of the United Nations. America should not be in the business of destabilizing countries. While we may see ourselves as liberators, the world increasingly views us as occupiers and aggressors. Alexandria believes that we must end the \u201cforever war\u201d by bringing our troops home, and ending the air strikes that perpetuate the cycle of terrorism throughout the world. By bringing our troops home, we can begin to heal the wounds we\u2019re opening by continuing military engagement. We can begin to repair our image. We can reunite military families, separated by repeated deployments. We can become stronger by building stronger diplomatic and economic ties, and by saving our armed forces only for when they\u2019re truly needed. In addition, Ocasio-Cortez has repeatedly used her widely-followed Twitter account to attack U.S. wars in Syria and elsewhere:           Ocasio-Cortez did not provide an alternative solution for Syria, or for Kurdish security, or relations with Turkey.
