      "subtitle": "Sacha Baron Cohen\u2019s Showtime series\u00a0Who is America\u00a0ended without airing his interview with Sarah Palin\u00a0after the comedian purportedly posed as a disabled veteran to gain access to the former\u00a0Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate.",
      "author": "Ben Kew",
      "content": " According to\u00a0The Hollywood Reporter,\u00a0Palin\u2019s interview did not make the final cut of the show, which also features segments with O.J. Simpson and former Democratic congressman Barney Frank. Such a decision was hinted at by Showtime president of programming Gary Levine earlier this month after he said that Cohen has a \u201cvery high bar\u201d for what makes the final cut. \u201cAll I can say about that is that there are several people who have thrown themselves in front of buses that may not be heading their way,\u201d he told reporters at the time. News that Palin may be involved in the show emerged last month after she revealed that Cohen had duped her by posing as a disabled veteran eager to discuss issues facing the country. \u201cCohen pretended to be a disabled veteran from Kentucky who was a big fan of Governor Palin,\u201d a source close to Palin told Breitbart News at the time. \u201cHe was wearing a necklace made of bullets and had a laptop covered in InfoWars stickers.\u201d \u201cHis disguise was basically a caricature of a conservative middle-class Trump voter,\u201d they continued. \u201cHe was asking her absurd, racist, homophobic, and sexist questions that were all meant to mock Trump voters as a bunch of ignorant and offensive kooks.\u201d Eventually, Sarah Palin walked away from the interview after Cohen asked her a \u201chorrible\u201d question about whether Chelsea Clinton had been subject to a government-funded sex change.\u00a0She has since called on CBS and Showtime to \u201cdonate all proceeds to a charitable group that actually respects and supports American Vets.\u201d Since its debut last month,\u00a0Who is America\u00a0has received generally mixed reviews from critics. Other prominent figures duped by the 46-year-old British prankster include former vice-president Dick Cheney, Alabama Senatorial candidate Roy Moore, and former presidential candidate Bernie Sanders.

      "subtitle": "The\u00a0New York Times published an editorial Wednesday evening about the attack on Republicans\u00a0earlier that day in which it\u00a0claimed falsely that Sarah Palin incited the 2011 Tucson shooting, and that the killer\u00a0had political\u00a0motives.",
      "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
      "content": " The\u00a0Times\u2018 editorial, \u201cAmerica\u2019s Lethal Politics,\u201d\u00a0will appear in the print edition of Thursday\u2019s newspaper. It argues that political violence will continue unless President Donald Trump and the Republicans stop opposing gun control. Along the way, the\u00a0Times claims [original link]: Was this attack evidence of how vicious American politics has become? Probably. In 2011, when Jared Lee Loughner opened fire in a supermarket parking lot, grievously wounding Representative Gabby Giffords and killing six people, including a 9-year-old girl, the link to political incitement was clear. Before the shooting, Sarah Palin\u2019s political action committee circulated\u00a0a map of targeted electoral districts that put Ms. Giffords and 19 other Democrats under stylized cross hairs. However, there was no evidence of\u00a0political \u201cincitement.\u201d First of all, the Tucson killer, Jared Loughner, was mentally disturbed and had no political motivations. As even the left-wing HuffPost reiterated\u00a0Wednesday: \u201cPeople said Jared Lee Loughner was motivated by politics. Reporting proved them wrong.\u201d Second, Sarah Palin\u2019s map was virtually identical to those used by Democrats for years, depicting targets atop contested congressional districts. At the time, Palin called the false accusations against her a \u201cblood libel,\u201d and for good reason: it was a slander imputing responsibility to her for the deaths of innocents, with the sole purpose of punishing her for her beliefs. The\u00a0Times goes on to argue that \u201cthere\u2019s no sign of incitement as direct as in the Giffords attack\u201d in Wednesday\u2019s shooting. That statement is so completely false that it calls to mind George Orwell\u2019s\u00a0observation about journalism during the Spanish Civil War: \u201cI saw newspaper reports which did not bear any relation to the facts, not even the relationship which is implied in an ordinary lie.\u201d There is no evidence whatsoever\u00a0of political incitement in the Giffords case, while there is overwhelming evidence that James T. Hodgkinson, the now-deceased attacker\u00a0at the baseball diamond, nurtured a vicious hatred of Trump and Republicans\u00a0and was a fan of left-wing media. And according to eyewitnesses, he asked whether the players were Republicans or Democrats before attacking. That is not conclusive evidence of incitement \u2014 at least, not yet \u2014 but it is more persuasive than in any other recent case. The\u00a0Times\u2018 false equivalence between the\u00a0two shootings provides a sick excuse\u00a0for what Hodgkinson did by\u00a0making it appear to be partially Republicans\u2019 fault. That is worse than \u201cfake news.\u201d It is an effort to exploit a horrific act of violence for\u00a0the purpose of stoking political divisions, reinforcing the hysteria in which Hodgkinson\u00a0was steeped.

      "subtitle": "Sarah Palin, former Alaska governor and Republican vice presidential candidate, looked at the first one hundred days of President\u00a0Trump\u2019s administration on Thursday\u2019s Breitbart News Daily with SiriusXM host Alex Marlow.",
      "author": "John Hayward",
      "content": " \u201cI\u2019m extremely pleased, of course, that our new president is in there building the team that he believes he needs in order to fulfill promises to the American electorate, to make America great again, and I\u2019m very, very happy that he\u2019s there,\u201d said Palin. LISTEN:  She said she found the idea of giving a simplistic letter grade to the Trump administration annoying, preferring to say President Trump is doing \u201cvery well.\u201d \u201cRemember, those of you who maybe still aren\u2019t aboard the Trump Train but know that the Trump movement had to be ushered in, in order to get rid of the status quo that was harming America, keep doing your ABCs and remember what that was: it was Anybody but Clinton,\u201d she said. \u201cSo stick with your little alphabet analogy there. Those who are asking for a grade of this administration, just keep remembering it could have been Clinton.\u201d Palin applauded Marlow\u2019s point that arguing over\u00a0the fine points of Trump\u2019s policy, and even dealing with some disappointments, should be vastly preferable for conservatives over fighting for their political lives \u2013 and even basic constitutional freedoms, like free speech \u2013 under a Clinton presidency. She suggested imagining what sort of Supreme Court justice would currently be taking the late Antonin Scalia\u2019s place under President Hillary Clinton. Marlow noted that Palin has been \u201cquite critical in recent days\u201d of President Trump\u2019s pick for Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. \u201cShe said, \u2018Common Core now doesn\u2019t exist\u2019 or something, and you went buck wild on her,\u201d Marlow recalled. \u201cI sure did!\u201d Palin cheerfully agreed. \u201cShe said that, in fact, Common Core hasn\u2019t really existed for the past couple of years. I would ask, do these politicians, do these elitist bureaucrats, do they even send their children or grandchildren, are they in public schools? When our kids and our grandkids come home and we sit down with them each night, still to this day, and we work with them on their homework, the Common Core curriculum is alive and not well in the classroom.\u201d \u201cIf the leader now of the education sector of our country would deny that Common Core is in existence, she needs to try to tell that to our really, really great public school teachers, who still have to explain and kind of apologize to the public school parents \u2013 I\u2019m one of them \u2013 as to why the curriculum is as confusing and burdensome and less freeing for our teachers, who know what our students need best, as do the parents. Good schoolteachers still have to explain to us that under Common Core, these requirements are quite burdensome and nonsensical,\u201d she said. She accused DeVos of being \u201creally out of touch\u201d for denying all of this was happening. Palin followed up with some of the highlights of Trump\u2019s first hundred days, beginning with the confirmation of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. \u201cI\u2019m extremely thankful \u2013 we all should be \u2013 that he\u2019s in there now,\u201d she said. She also praised Trump\u2019s commitment to change President Barack Obama\u2019s \u201clead from behind\u201d foreign policy, \u201cwhich made the world a less safe place to be.\u201d \u201cTrump quashed that. He said no more leading from behind. America is that \u2018beacon of hope.\u2019 We are a country\u00a0\u2026 of just this perfect storm, if you will, with the natural resources to be developed, with the manpower, and with the intellect, and with the patriotism, the unity that a country needs in order to be so successful, to be great and to be a leader that other countries would wish to emulate. America has all that, and we can put it into play for the greater good of the world by leading, and not leading from behind, which is kind of Orwellian-speak,\u201d said Palin. \u201cLeading again on the global stage and the Supreme Court pick, those are two specifics \u2013 but Alex, we need to make sure to remind our friends, our supporters, people who are really tuned in to what\u2019s going on today and get frustrated under any administration. Maybe they\u2019re frustrated with what Trump does, some of the wrinkles that are certainly part of the agenda that we\u2019ve witnessed,\u201d she suggested. \u201cWe can never put our faith and our hope in man, in any one man, certainly not a politician,\u201d Palin counseled. \u201cMan is fallible. We\u2019re going to be disappointed if we put all of our hope and faith in one man \u2013 a politician, a government that cannot make us happy, healthy, wealthy, and wise. We need to look at the bigger picture here, as you suggested in your opening.\u201d Another highlight of the first hundred days for Palin was the \u201cquote-unquote massive tax cut proposals that will come from the White House.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m extremely happy about that. That\u2019s another promise fulfilled,\u201d she said. \u201cWe know that to allow us to be solvent and sovereign, we need to see jobs created. The way that jobs are going to be created and people will be productive again in this country is for tax cuts that will really benefit the middle class, especially the working class. More jobs will be created with tax cuts, so I\u2019m excited about that coming down the pike.\u201d \u201cWe have to cut taxes,\u201d she stressed. \u201cLook at that corporate tax rate we have that is, what, second highest in the developed world? Our corporate tax rate certainly is one of the job creation prohibiters that we\u2019re suffering under. So that has to be done, and certainly people with our income taxes, we realize it\u2019s taxation without representation. The government is taking from us the fruits of our labor, and we\u2019re not receiving the services in return that are on par with the amount that they\u2019re taking from us. It\u2019s a given: taxes must be cut in this country, and I would think that everybody knows that.\u201d \u201cBut as for it then contributing to an accumulation of debt \u2013 you\u2019re right: it\u2019s semantics, and it\u2019s bogus,\u201d Palin said to Marlow\u2019s point that the left controls the language of tax reform and treats tax cuts as an expensive indulgence that must be \u201cpaid for\u201d somehow. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to result in accumulation of debt,\u201d she argued. \u201cWe can\u2019t just hand that over to those in government who hold the purse strings and keep spending more and more money that we do not have. We need to ratchet down the size of government. This government overreach in every area of our life that\u2019s getting more and more expensive, we can\u2019t just swallow that and say, \u2018Oh, well, that\u2019s just the way it is, and wow, we\u2019re going to have to take more money from the people in order to pay for growing government.\u2019\u201d \u201cIt always killed me when I was a city council member, I was a mayor, I was a city manager, I was a governor, and I would watch every 12 months when the government\u2019s budget was due. I\u2019d either help craft it, or it would come across my desk. I would always ask the bureaucrats and the politicians creating these budgets, \u2018What\u2019s going on here? Just because 365 days have passed, you just automatically inherently believe that the budget amount has to increase? Why? Are people getting more for the money that you\u2019re taking from them? Has the population grown that much?\u2019\u201d she recalled. \u201cIn each level of government, it\u2019s just so inherent that oh, you know, government grows; that\u2019s just the way it is. It doesn\u2019t have to,\u201d Palin contended. Marlow asked Palin about the \u201cwar on free speech\u201d conducted by masked thugs at universities, prominently including Berkeley, where he was once a student. \u201cWell, first, it blows me away that you\u2019re from Berkeley. Talk about not drinking the Kool-Aid!\u201d Palin said with a laugh. \u201cThese Berkeley students, bless their hearts, they\u2019re hypocrites on steroids,\u201d she said on a more serious note. \u201cIt is amazing to me and anybody else with just an ounce of common sense in their veins to ever be able to believe that those who preach tolerance and diversity, and we\u2019re gonna embrace diversity \u2013 but Heaven forbid you say something that might hurt our little snowflakey feelings. You know, we\u2019ll melt there down in Berkeley if you say something that we can\u2019t agree with!\u201d \u201cIn the end, they\u2019re the most intolerant people if they are going to protest someone who is a bastion of free speech. Ann Coulter is on their side! When they are spewing the free speech rhetoric, she\u2019s saying, \u2018Exactly! And here, let\u2019s exercise it! Let me prove to you, you guys prove with me, that we\u2019re all for free speech!\u2019 And yet, they\u2019re so blinded by their hatred for anybody who does not agree just down the line with them on everything that they will not tolerate Ann Coulter speaking her mind,\u201d said Palin. Marlow advised President Trump to resist advice about \u201cmoderating\u201d his positions to secure the approval of left-wingers who will never stop hating him \u2013 something Palin is well positioned to understand, as the target of an unprecedented campaign of left-wing vilification in 2008. \u201cAmen. Preach it, brother,\u201d Palin agreed. \u201cPresident Trump needs to realize he can\u2019t win them over. You cannot. He can learn from our mistakes, those of us who have been in that position on a much smaller scale. We have tried to win them over, and it doesn\u2019t work. It bites you in the butt, and it harms those who you have promised to serve.\u201d \u201cRight on, too, in talking about the big tent,\u201d she said to Marlow\u2019s defense of an ideologically diverse Republican Party. \u201cYou know, most of us, we come from big-tent families. Our social circles even, and our communities, they\u2019re big tents, and really, we\u2019re better off for it. Talk about diversity and learning from other people\u2019s perspectives that are shared and all that \u2013 that\u2019s all great.\u201d \u201cBut no, when you are leading an agenda that people have put blood, sweat, and tears forth, to make sure that agenda finally is given an opportunity to be made manifest so that our lives can be made better, you have to surround yourself with people who are obviously going to help the cause and not hurt the cause,\u201d she added. \u201cYou cannot surround yourself, one, with a bunch of yes-men. That certainly harms the cause. You will never grow as a leader. You have to be growing as a leader as your constituents will be growing along with you. So you can\u2019t have a bunch of yes-men. Those of us who have been in business and been in politics certainly recognize that,\u201d said Palin. \u201cBut also, you have to have those who at least will share your vision. Maybe some of the idiosyncrasies, maybe some of the details in how you\u2019re going to get there, you can argue some of the ways to do that, but the vision has got to be the same,\u201d she emphasized. \u201cNow, do globalists, do big government professional politicians who are in it for a season, not a reason \u2013 they\u2019re in politics for a job, for a career, for the money, for the power \u2013 do they share the vision of average, hard-working, patriotic Americans who want government out of our lives so that we can be trusted as individuals to run our businesses the way that we know best and to raise our families the way that is best for our families?\u201d Palin asked. \u201cGovernment, faceless bureaucrats, they don\u2019t know how to do that. They keep screwing it up. Well, globalists and big government people, some in office today under Trump, they believe in that garbage of big government knowing best. That is the antithesis of the vision that those on the Trump Train have, and that Trump Train roared through this country so powerfully, so loudly and adamantly, that there was no stopping it. That\u2019s why I wasn\u2019t surprised when Trump won,\u201d she contended. \u201cSo those who don\u2019t share that vision, who are there, quote-unquote, serving our president and the vision, the mission that he is on, that is shared by the majority of the voters \u2013 it\u2019s frustrating to us because we do want to sound that warning bell that you can\u2019t win them over. They\u2019re certainly stuck in their ways, and if they give you lip service that they\u2019re there with you \u2013 those are the yes-men that we don\u2019t need around our president,\u201d Palin advised. In parting, Palin suggested a mission for Marlow: \u201cI wish you would take the opportunity to get down to Berkeley and speak with your alumni. Go down there and talk to the folks down there about what tolerance really is and how healthy diverse opinions really can be. Talk about the Second Amendment. You would be one, Alex \u2013 well, they\u2019d probably get really wee-weed up about it \u2013 but you could be a great spokesperson for the cause.\u201d Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m.\u00a0to 9:00 a.m.\u00a0Eastern.

      "author": "Tony Lee",
      "content": " A week after Palin called for Obama to be impeached over his lawlessness on immigration on the pages of Breitbart News, two-thirds of Republicans believed that impeachment is justified while a majority of independents felt that Obama has overstepped his Constitutional authority.\u00a0Speaking at the Western Conservative Summit in Colorado, Palin said \u201cconsidering articles of impeachment is the check\u201d against a lawless executive branch. Citing Obama\u2019s \u201cdereliction of duty\u201d in enforcing the country\u2019s immigration laws and securing the border, Palin said, \u201cif that\u2019s not impeachable, then nothing is. And if he\u2019s not impeachable, no one is.\u201d \u201cIt takes guts to hold them accountable,\u201d she said. \u201cIt takes political will.\u201d Palin told Republicans to \u201cdon\u2019t be afraid to raise\u201d the impeachment issue because Obama is making \u201chimself a ruler and not a president.\u201d Palin said America had a revolution because \u201cwe don\u2019t do kings.\u201d She observed that \u201cthese days you hear a lot of politicians denouncing Barack Obama,\u201d saying he\u2019s a lawless and imperial president who ignores court orders, changes laws by executive fiat, and refuses to enforce laws that he just doesn\u2019t like. Palin asked the politicians who are complaining, \u201cwhat are ya gonna do about it? \u201cLet\u2019s call their bluff,\u201d Palin said. \u201cI\u2019m calling their bluff because we need a little less talk and a lot more action.\u201d Declaring that Obama\u2019s lawlessness is \u201crocking us to our core,\u201d Palin said that \u201cno\u00a0serious person can deny that team Obama has not violated and abused the public trust and the Constitution.\u201d Palin listed Benghazi, Fast and Furious, NSA spying scandals, Obamacare lies, the IRS\u2019s targeting of conservatives, the administration\u2019s violation of religious rights, and the Department of Justice\u2019s wiretapping of reporters. \u201cThe\u00a0list of abuses goes on and on,\u201d she said. Palin also mentioned that \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d does not refer to today\u2019s ordinary criminal charges. She reiterated that the Framers referred to \u201ca dereliction of duty,\u201d and \u201cthe first duty of the president is to enforce\u00a0our laws and preserve and protect and defend our Constitution.\u201d She said\u00a0Alexander Hamilton said impeachable offenses refer to \u201cthe abuse or violation of some public trust.\u201d Hamilton called them \u201cpolitical offenses\u201d because they relate \u201cchiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself,\u201d Palin said, noting that impeachment is a check against a lawless executive. Palin announced in an op-ed on\u00a0Breitbart.com\u00a0that Obama\u2019s \u201cmany impeachable offenses\u201d can no longer be ignored. \u201cIt\u2019s time to impeach; and on behalf of American workers and legal immigrants of all backgrounds, we should vehemently oppose any politician on the left or right who would hesitate in voting for articles of impeachment,\u201d\u00a0Palin wrote. As Breitbart News noted, \u201cPalin specifically said Obama\u2019s lawlessness on illegal immigration was the tipping point because it impacted Americans \u2014 native-born and legal immigrants \u2014 of all backgrounds\u201d: The federal government is trillions of dollars in debt; many cities are on the verge of insolvency; our overrun healthcare system, police forces, social services, schools, and our unsustainably generous welfare-state programs are stretched to the max. We average Americans know that. So why has this issue been allowed to be turned upside down with our \u201cleader\u201d creating such unsafe conditions while at the same time obstructing any economic recovery by creating more dependents than he allows producers? His friendly wealthy bipartisan elite, who want cheap foreign labor and can afford for themselves the best \u201cborder security\u201d money can buy in their own exclusive communities, do not care that Obama tapped us out. Have faith that average American workers \u2013 native-born and wonderful legal immigrants of all races, backgrounds, and political parties \u2013 do care because we\u2019re the ones getting screwed as we\u2019re forced to follow all our government\u2019s rules while others are not required to do so. Many now feel like strangers in their own land. It\u2019s the American worker who is forced to deal with Obama\u2019s latest crisis with our hard-earned tax dollars while middle class wages decrease, sustainable jobs get more scarce, and communities become unrecognizable and bankrupted due to Obama\u2019s flood of illegal immigration. Who\u2019s looking out for the American workers? Who has their backs? Who fights for them? We should. Obama has also been reportedly concerned that his executive actions on immigration can lead to impeachment. He reportedly, in a half-joking manner, told pro-amnesty activists at the White House, \u201cYou\u2019re not going to get me impeached, are you?\u201d",

      "author": "Tony Lee",
      "content": "  \u201cThe Mississippi Senate race is a clear fight for the future of the Republican Party against the entrenched interests of the permanent political class in D.C. We desperately need new conservative leaders in the U.S. Senate who will serve with passion, intelligence, and integrity.\u201d UPDATE: McDaniel told Breitbart News that Palin\u2019s endorsement will help him and his campaign \u201cend the rule of the permanent political class in Washington, D.C.\u201d: \u201cGovernor Sarah Palin\u2019s endorsement is very important in the state of Mississippi. We Mississippians are conservatives, and we share Sarah Palin\u2019s passion for limited government, lower taxes, traditional values, and constitutional liberties. This is a grassroots movement driven by the people of Mississippi, so there\u2019s no question Gov. Palin\u2019s endorsement will help motivate people to get behind this campaign to end the rule of the permanent political class in Washington, D.C.\u201d Palin wrote that McDaniel was \u201cjust such a leader\u201d who is\u00a0\u201cin this race not for career, but for conservative change.\u201d\u00a0She said he \u201chas a proven record of fighting for conservative principles in the Mississippi State Senate\u201d and \u201cbeen a champion of limited government, free enterprise, civic participation, reduced tax rates, a strong national defense, and a return to the original checks and balances of the Constitution.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s a proven fighter for the rights of We the People. For example, he\u2019s taken on special interests in defense of our private property rights against the abuse of eminent domain, and he\u2019s introduced legislation to protect our 2nd Amendment rights against federal government overreach,\u201d Palin wrote. McDaniel said that he was \u201ctruly humbled that Governor Palin has honored my request for her to join my campaign in this fight for liberty in Mississippi.\u201d \u201cGovernor Palin is a true champion of conservative self-reliance that so many Americans and Mississippians identify with and admire,\u201d he said. \u201cWe knew we\u2019d need help in this uphill battle against entrenched incumbency in Washington, D.C. and we could not be more thrilled to have the governor\u2019s support.\u201d Cochran has said he was\u00a0unfamiliar\u00a0with the Tea Party movement, and he may now realize what that movement is about as Palin, considered the North Star for the conservative grassroots, can galvanize and boost candidates like no other, especially in what is expected to be a low-turnout primary on June 3. \u201cThe Tea Party is something I don\u2019t really know a lot about,\u201d Cochran recently told Mississippi television stations. \u201cIt\u2019s a free country. We have open opportunities for people to participate in the election process.\u201d Former South Carolina Senator and Heritage Foundation President Jim DeMint has said that Palin\u2019s endorsement has the\u00a0most impact\u00a0in GOP primaries. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) has said that\u00a0he would not be in the Senate were it not for Palin\u2019s endorsement, for instance. Palin urged conservatives to learn more about McDaniel on his website,\u00a0www.mcdaniel2014.com, and her endorsement is likely to rally conservatives against Cochran, who has been assailed as an appropriator who has not stood up Washington\u2019s fiscal irresponsibility. As Breitbart News has reported, Cochran \u201chas voted on at least 11 occasions to raise the debt ceiling by at least $7.7 trillion over the past 24 years.\u201d Cochran, who has been described by mainstream outlets as a \u201cseasoned appropriator\u201d who is a \u201cspitting image of the Republican establishment,\u201d\u00a0reportedly planned on retiring after his term but was convinced to run for another because he would gain control of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee should the GOP pick up six seats in the fall to take back control of the Senate. Even before an establishment PAC\u00a0associated\u00a0with former Mississippi Governor and lobbyist Haley Barbour had formed to try to save Cochran\u2019s candidacy by running attack ads against McDaniel statewide,\u00a0Palin\u00a0had indicated that she would be looking closely at the Mississippi GOP Senate primary. McDaniel has also been\u00a0endorsed by Heritage Action, the Senate Conservative Fund, the Club for Growth, and Freedomworks. Palin, after promising to start rolling out endorsements for candidates this week who would go to Washington to fight for conservative values, has\u00a0endorsed T.W. Shannon for Senate in Oklahoma and Ben Sasse\u00a0for Senate in Nebraska in addition to McDaniel.",

China\u2019s predatory pricing of steel and aluminum exports is designed to destroy the financial viability of America\u2019s domestic manufacturers of the metals, said Mansour: What China is doing, they are willing to take a loss on steel and dump steel below the price of what it costs them to make it simply because they want to destroy our industry for a strategic reason. They want the world to be dependent on them. They want to take the market; that\u2019s why they\u2019re dumping steel. This is an act of war. This is economic warfare. \u201cPOTUS isn\u2019t starting any trade war\u2026 it\u2019s been raging for decades and we keep losing,\u201d wrote Palin. \u201cPeople MUST understand our nation\u2019s solvency and sovereignty are at stake here.\u201d  The \u201cTrump Doctrine\u201d illustrates the president\u2019s wisdom via his \u201cprivate sector experience,\u201d wrote Palin: President Trump inherited this trade war, and he\u2019s an atypical politician determined to actually do something to fix the problem. The Trump Doctrine involves finally enforcing rules and standards to level the playing field \u2014 which proves the wisdom of private sector perspective brought to the White House. President Trump is consistent on tariffs. He\u2019s preached about fair competition via tariffs for decades, so why all this feigned shock at his recent proposal? No matter though, because middle class Americans concerned about our industrial demise \u201cget it.\u201d And we see the heads exploding over this issue sit atop career bureaucrats, globalists and typical politicians who\u2019ve done nothing to fix trade imbalances\u2026 which pretty much says it all. Mansour has praised President Donald Trump\u2019s\u00a0intention\u00a0to go \u201cfull economic nationalist\u201d by levying tariffs on China to \u201cprotect American industry\u201d from China\u2019s\u00a0dumping of steel and aluminum.

      "author": "Tony Lee",
      "content": " This week, Bernie Quigley observed that Palin \u201cwas prelude and harbinger\u201d to Trump\u2019s arrival. He\u00a0wrote in\u00a0The Hill that he was reading William Strauss and Neil Howe\u2019s The Fourth Turning when Palin appeared on the national stage. And he said then that \u201cit was possible to see the rise of new political archetypes and forms and they are now upon us.\u201d \u201cIt was not President Donald Trump that brought the age, although he turned the key. It was Palin. And it was she who brought the reawakened spirit of Andrew Jackson, today associated with the rise of Trump,\u201d Quigley wrote. In 2010, Quigley wrote that the \u201cchange that is rising now with Palin\u201d and the Tea Party movement \u201cresembles the rise of Andrew Jackson and the free people of the western regions demanding their place and coming into the country politically.\u201d \u201cNo wonder the New York press was afraid of her then. No wonder they are still,\u201d Quigley wrote while discussing Palin\u2019s defamation lawsuit against the New York Times. While others have foolishly and inaccurately written about how New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who never appealed to conservatives, was \u201cTrump before Trump,\u201d it was actually Palin who paved Trump\u2019s road to the GOP presidential nomination and 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. As someone who has followed Palin\u2019s political career as closely as anyone, I immediately saw in Trump\u2019s campaign many similarities to Palin. They shared the same enemies who loathed them because Palin and Trump did not need political hacks in the permanent political class\u00a0to get their message to the voters. In 2016, it\u00a0was indeed quite telling that Trump made the same enemies Palin did on the right while the legacy media underestimated him like they did Palin while, at the same time, doing all they could to destroy him just like they attempted to do with the\u00a0former Alaska governor. Here are the top nine ways Palin was a\u00a0prelude to Trump: On April 29, 2009, Alaska Governor Palin joined Twitter and promptly called out a distorted story\u2014in today\u2019s parlance, a \u201cfake news\u201d story\u2014in the establishment press about her administration. The politician I dubbed \u201cThe Great CommuniTweeter\u201d\u00a0would be immediately mocked and ridiculed by the legacy\u00a0media and the political establishment for communicating with voters on Twitter and Facebook instead of on their networks and with the help of overpriced consultants. Years later, the same media figures and establishment operatives, who are always light years behind the curve and\u00a0initially mocked Palin, would be addicted to Twitter and Facebook and use those platforms on a daily basis just like Palin the pioneer had in 2009. During the 2016 election, Trump, like Palin had figured out years before, used Twitter to influence the news cycle, create headlines, and, most importantly, go around the mainstream media\u2019s and the political establishment\u2019s filters to get information and opinions directly to voters. And as Trump has demonstrated with his CNN-WWE Tweet that went around the world, he is more than willing to use Twitter to get his message directly to the people, challenge and distract the \u201cfake news\u201d media, and make the establishment media look foolish and out of touch when they inevitably overreact and make the story all about them. In fact, Trump has said that his use of \u201csocial media\u201d is \u201cMODERN DAY PRESIDENTIAL.\u201d He\u00a0recently told the New York Times\u2019 Mark Leibovich that he will not stop communicating to voters via Twitter. \u201cIt\u2019s my voice. They want to take away my voice,\u2019\u2019 Trump told the reporter. \u2018\u2018They\u2019re not going to take away my social media.\u2019\u2019  When Fox News and other outlets released unfavorable polls about Palin leading up the 2012 election cycle, Palin famously dismissed them, saying that \u201cpolls are for strippers and cross-country skiers.\u201d She was right. What inside-the-box consultants and equally incurious legacy media dunces have never realized is the importance of \u201csocial desirability bias\u201d when\u00a0unconventional, controversial, or historical candidates are polled. To put it simply, voters may be reluctant to tell pollsters that they actually support someone like Palin or Trump when they actually do because they think such support will render them socially undesirable. Breitbart News\u2014based on interviews with voters around the country and this writer\u2019s personal \u201cfocus group\u201d of sorts of working-class friends and their family members whose opinions and impressions of candidates have been over the years uncannily representative of the Reagan Democrat swing voters who voted for Obama and then switched to Trump\u2014wrote extensively about\u00a0the potential for a \u201creverse-Bradley effect\u201d during the 2016 election cycle when national polls had Hillary Clinton out in front. Trump even alluded to Breitbart News\u2019 stories on the reverse-Bradley effect multiple times on the stump. Thomas Edsall actually wrote about social desirability bias\u2014 \u201cthe desire of respondents to avoid embarrassment and project a favorable image to others\u201d\u2014in the New York Times last year as well, concluding that \u201cthe simple fact that Trump has beaten the odds so far means that it is not beyond the realm of possibility that he could beat them again.\u201d \u201cIf he does take the White House, much, if not all, of his margin of victory will come from voters too ashamed to acknowledge publicly how they intend to cast their vote,\u201d Edsall wrote. And that is exactly what happened. Polls have underestimated the actual support for politicians like Barack Obama, Palin, and Trump, and it seems like their spouses were actually among the\u00a0few who understood the importance of social desirability bias in polling. Michelle Obama, for instance, knew that black voters who may not have felt comfortable telling pollsters they supported his candidacy would come home to Obama even when polls had him massively trailing Hillary Clinton in South Carolina in the early stages of the 2008 election cycle. Todd Palin also knew that if Palin had run, voters who did not want to tell properly-sounding pollsters that they supported Palin for fear that they would get ridiculed and ostracized would also swarm voting booths to support her. And Melania Trump also knew that Trump\u2019s low poll numbers with the GOP base would rocket up as soon as he actually announced his candidacy. While the mainstream media were mocking Palin, she delivered two of the most important and substantive speeches of the 2012 election cycle that pushed the GOP away from the cronyism and foreign policy interventionism associated with the Bush era. In Iowa, Palin threw down against\u00a0the corporatism and cronyism associated with the likes of Tom DeLay, Dennis Hastert, and the infamous \u201cK-Street\u201d project that contributed significantly to the GOP losing control of all three branches of government last decade. Palin injected ideas like \u201ccrony capitalism\u201d and fighting the \u201cpermanent political class\u201d into the political bloodstream in a way other reformers who lacked her wattage and star power could never do. In Indianola, Iowa, in August of 2011, Palin, explaining the important\u00a0difference between being pro-free markets and pro-big business,\u00a0said: This is not the capitalism of free men and free markets, of innovation and hard work and ethics, of sacrifice and of risk. No, this is the capitalism of connections and government bailouts and handouts, of waste and influence peddling and corporate welfare. This is the crony capitalism that destroyed Europe\u2019s economies. It\u2019s the collusion of big government and big business and big finance to the detriment of all the rest \u2013 to the little guys. It\u2019s a slap in the face to our small business owners \u2013 the true entrepreneurs, the job creators accounting for 70% of the jobs in America, it\u2019s you who own these small businesses, you\u2019re the economic engine, but you don\u2019t grease the wheels of government power. So, do you want to know why the permanent political class doesn\u2019t really want to cut any spending? Do you want to know why nothing ever really gets done? It\u2019s because there\u2019s nothing in it for them. They\u2019ve got a lot of mouths to feed \u2013 a lot of corporate lobbyists and a lot of special interests that are counting on them to keep the good times and the money rolling along. Three months before, in May of 2011, Palin went to Colorado Christian University in Lakewood, Colorado, and moved the GOP away from neoconservatism to realism.\u00a0In Colorado, Palin outlined her five-point plan that included: committing forces only when \u201cvital American interests\u201d are at stake; fighting to win with overwhelming force if America has to\u00a0go to war; having clearly defined goals and objectives before sending troops into war zones; making sure American soldiers are never put under foreign command; and ensuring that sending Americans soldiers is always the last resort. \u201cWe are not indifferent to the cause of human rights or the desire for freedom. We are always on the side of both,\u201d Palin said after laying out her doctrine. \u201cBut we can\u2019t fight every war. We can\u2019t undo every injustice around the world. But with strength and clarity in those five points, we\u2019ll make for a safer, more prosperous, more peaceful world because as the U.S. leads by example, as we support freedom across the globe, we\u2019re going to prove that free and healthy countries don\u2019t wage war on other free and healthy countries. The stronger we are, the stronger and more peaceful the world will be under our example.\u201d In 2016, Trump ran as a candidate who opposed George W. Bush\u2019s Iraq war and nonsensical interventions abroad. Even\u00a0Foreign Policy acknowledged\u00a0Trump\u2019s coherent realism: Trump has little time for either neoconservatives or liberal interventionists; he thinks they allow their belief in American virtue to blind them to both America\u2019s core interests and the limits of American power. He has even less time for multilateralist diplomats: They\u2019re too willing to compromise, trading away American interests in exchange for platitudes about friendship and cooperation. And he has no time at all for those who consider long-standing U.S. alliances sacrosanct. To Trump, U.S. alliances, like potential business partners in a real-estate transaction, should always be asked: \u201cWhat have you done for me lately?\u201d In his inimitable way, Trump is offering a powerful challenge to many of the core assumptions of Washington\u2019s bipartisan foreign-policy elite. And if mainstream Democrats and Republicans want to counter Trump\u2019s appeal, they need to get serious about explaining why his vision of the world isn\u2019t appropriate \u2014 and they need to do so without merely falling back on tired clich\u00e9s. Trump also self-funded his campaign during the primary to show voters that he would not be beholden to lobbyists and big-money influencers who got the better of many GOP lawmakers in the Bush era when Washington, D.C. officially became the country\u2019s \u201cBoomtown.\u201d Americans who were fed up with cronyism in D.C. and ill-advised adventures abroad that cost too many American lives gave Trump the benefit of the doubt and gave the outsider businessman a chance in 2016. But had the legacy media been paying attention to how much Palin\u2019s words were resonating, they would not have been so surprised and blindsided by Trump\u2019s popularity. Before Trump ran against the D.C. \u201cswamp,\u201d Palin eviscerated the permanent political class and politicians who came to D.C. looking to change it and instead saw the \u201ccesspool of corruption\u201d as a big \u201chot tub.\u201d Speaking at the Conservative\u00a0Political Action Conference (CPAC) in 2012,\u00a0Palin said: Yeah, the permanent political class \u2013 they\u2019re doing just fine. Ever notice how so many of them arrive in Washington, D.C. of modest means and then miraculously throughout the years they end up becoming very, very wealthy? Well, it\u2019s because they derive power and their wealth from their access to our money \u2013 to taxpayer dollars. They use it to bail out their friends on Wall Street and their corporate cronies, and to reward campaign contributors, and to buy votes via earmarks. There is so much waste. And there is a name for this: It\u2019s called corporate crony capitalism. John Hayward wrote at the time that after \u201cdenouncing the cesspool of corruption\u201d in D.C., Palin said it becomes \u201cmore like a hot tub\u201d for elected officials after a year or two. \u201cAnd they\u2019re hopping in and enjoying the Jacuzzi!,\u201d Palin said, adding that it was \u201ctime we drain the jacuzzi and throw the bums out with the bath water.\u201d Trump\u2019s promise to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d was one of his most effective catchphrases during the 2016 election cycle that earned him the trust of voters who for decades have distrusted establishment politicians from both political parties.  Establishment Republicans immediately saw Palin as a threat right after Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) lost the 2008 presidential election to Barack Obama. Here\u2019s video of a jealous and threatened then-Texas Governor Rick Perry cutting off Palin\u2019s press conference at a November 2008 Republican Governors Association event\u00a0when it was obvious Palin was outshining all of them. It took the\u00a0\u201cprofessional conservatives\u201d a bit longer (May, 2010) to know that Palin was a threat to them and their ability to influence elections. For months, Erick Erickson and Red State plodded along to help Nikki Haley win South Carolina\u2019s GOP gubernatorial primary in 2010. But Haley was stuck in third until Palin endorsed her in May of 2010. Haley then rocketed to the top of the field, won the nomination, and went on to be South Carolina\u2019s governor. \u00a0A Republican operative who worked on a rival campaign told Peter Hamby, who was then at CNN and is now directing news for Snapchat, that Palin\u2019s event alone generated \u201cover a million dollars\u201d in media coverage and \u201cthere was absolutely no way when that endorsement came down to break through the news cycle.\u201d \u201cIt was an earned media blowtorch,\u201d the GOP operative later\u00a0had to admit to Hamby. And just like that, the professional conservatives were both jealous and threatened and started to undermine Palin going forward.\u00a0Palin needed neither them nor the establishment to influence primary elections and raise money. As establishment Republican Haley Barbour told Hamby, Palin could have raised enough money to \u201cburn a wet mule\u201d without the help of consultants had she chosen to enter the 2012 presidential contest. Of course, as always, the GOP establishment and the legacy media were more than thrilled, just like they would be when nearly the exact same group of people who hated Palin became the \u201cNever Trump\u201d movement, when professional \u201cconservatives\u201d who, for various self-serving reasons, wanted Rick Perry to win the 2012 GOP presidential nomination did all they could to needlessly trash Palin and her supporters. When Trump entered the presidential\u00a0field,\u00a0the very same establishment Republicans and professional conservatives, proving how clueless they were about GOP voters they demeaned as \u201clow-information\u201d rubes because they were not versed in obscure D.C. minutiae, said Trump would not even get enough support to make the main debate stage. When Trump started to lead in every poll, they collectively lost their minds. Erickson and many of his \u201cRed State\u201d allies in the\u00a0\u201cprofessional conservative industrial complex,\u201d many of whom apparently had no issues shilling for Malaysia while not disclosing the payments they received to their readers\u00a0until they were caught red-handed, joined Glenn Beck and his minions to oppose Trump. Establishment Republican hacks like Ana Navarro and Rick Wilson made common cause with them to form the \u201cNever Trump\u201d movement. The \u201cNever Trump\u201d movement was more about the \u201cNever Trumpers\u201d scratching and clawing to find excuses to get on television and be quoted in legacy media outlets in order\u00a0for\u00a0the legacy media to use them as their useful idiots against Trump and his \u00a0working-class supporters, whom these professional so-called \u201cinfluencers\u201d have treated with nothing but disdain. It is fitting that National Review, which was essentially the outlet of choice for Paul Ryan\u2019s and Eric Cantor\u2019s brand of establishment Republicanism, published its foolish \u201cNever Trump\u201d issue, which diminished whatever influence the publication had left with working-class voters\u00a0after Trump got elected. For many of these professional operatives and \u201cinfluencers,\u201d many of whom try to relive their junior-high and high-school years in the political world among other dweebs and pipsqueaks, Trump\u2019s rise meant they would not matter as much anymore. And they were not going to lose whatever influence they may have had\u00a0without a fight. Trump, like Palin, did not need overpriced lemmings and \u201cgrundoons\u201d to help him get \u201cliked\u201d by voters. He did not need them to help him get on television or get his message to voters. All Trump had to was hit the \u201csend\u201d button on Twitter. Trump did not even need them for attack ads since Trump neutered his rivals all by himself by naming them \u201cLow-energy Jeb,\u201d \u201cLittle Marco\u201d and \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted.\u201d The Hoover Institution\u2019s Alvin Rabushka\u00a0explained why the professional \u201cinfluencers\u201d and operatives detested Trump so much. To put it simply, Trump\u2019s rise to the top of the polls without much campaign spending represented\u00a0an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to the \u201cpolitical election industry.\u201d \u201cYou see, it\u2019s not so much that he is running as a Republican that frightens the political establishment,\u201d Rabuska wrote. \u201cIt fears that if he wins, others could seek office in the same way. A Trump victory threatens to put the political industry out of business as it is now.\u201d As Breitbart News noted at the time, Rabushka pointed out that\u00a0\u201cthe political election industry is a multibillion dollar enterprise\u201d and \u201cits ranks include the following\u201d: Consultants.\n\nCoaches.\n\nHandlers.\n\nAd Producers.\n\nFocus Groups.\n\nMedia Pundits.\n\nDonors.\n\nLobbyists. He added that\u00a0\u201cthe industry is used to dominating presidential elections\u201d and \u201cit is the go-to crowd that determines who deserves to be a candidate, win each party\u2019s nomination and ultimately secure the presidency. The industry regards itself as uniquely qualified to determine who is qualified to participate in the political process.\u201d Rabushka said they were particularly livid at Trump because he bypassed this exclusive \u201cclub\u201d: How dare he intrude in the \u201cclub?\u201d How dare he campaign for the presidency without the blessing of the \u201cclub?\u201d\u2026How dare he expose his critics? How dare he use social media to bypass the political industry? How dare he draw large, enthusiastic crowds? How dare he speak the language of the American people instead of the prepped, canned language of the political class? Rabushka continued: How did Claudius become emperor of Rome? After the assassination of Caligula, the Praetorian Guard anointed Claudius emperor. \u201cWhy,\u201d asked Claudius? \u201cBecause,\u201d said the head of the Guard,\u201d without an emperor, there is no need for the Praetorian Guard. Without traditional candidates like Clinton, Bush, Kasich, Huckabee, Christie, Santorum, Pataki and others, there is no need for the Political Establishment\u2019s Praetorian Guard. Trump threatens to undermine the political establishment order of things. To show that \u201cNever Trumpers\u201d are hardly oh-so-principled, it is worth noting\u00a0that the disastrous vehicle they used (the milquetoast Evan McMullin) to get on television, consultant fees, and quotes in legacy media outlets during the 2016 general election is still in debt. As of May of 2017, McMullin\u2019s campaign owed nearly\u00a0$700,000\u00a0to various political professionals. Before Trump started attacking the \u201cfake news\u201d media, Palin effectively branded the legacy media as the \u201clamestream media.\u201d The \u201clamestream media\u201d\u00a0tried to blame Palin for the assassination attempt on then-Rep. Gabby Giffords (D-AZ), mock her supporters, delegitimize her, harass her family, and work with the usual band of usual idiots in the GOP establishment to falsely try to create a narrative that she was losing her influence. Never mind that every Republican who wanted to run for office was begging for her endorsement behind the scenes while Republicans in elected officer were pleading with her camp behind the scenes to not criticize them. No wonder working-class Americans who supported Palin\u2013\u00a0the most \u201cbox office\u201d figure on the right before Trump\u2013began to see the media as even more of a joke as purportedly \u201cobjective\u201d hosts and anchors could not even pretend to hold back the disdain they had for Palin and her supporters. As mentioned above, Palin even used one of her first tweets in 2009 to correct a story in the legacy media that mischaracterized her administration in Alaska. And she ramped up her criticisms against the media as they became more vicious. Palin gave Trump the baton, and Trump has taken it to another level. \u201cThe media should be embarrassed and humiliated and keep its mouth shut and just listen for a while,\u201d Trump\u2019s chief strategist Steve Bannon told the New York Times earlier this year. \u201cI want you to quote this. The media here is the opposition party. They don\u2019t understand this country. They still do not understand why Donald Trump is the president of the United States.\u201d Trump, in addition to tweeting the WWE-CNN meme that went around the world, has routinely called out the \u201cfake and fraudulent\u201d media who nitpick at everything and try to find anything they can to delegitimize him. \u201cTheir agenda is not your agenda,\u201d Trump recently said of the \u201cfake news\u201d media. \u201cThe fake media is trying to silence us but we will not let them. The people know the truth. The fake media tried to stop us from going to the White House, but I\u2019m president and they\u2019re not.\u201d    Before Trump waged his war against Fox News and Megyn Kelly, Palin clashed with the late Roger Ailes and \u201cBush\u2019s Brain\u201d Karl Rove. Though Palin was a\u00a0Fox News contributor, Ailes, who favored candidates like New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and Mitt Romney in the 2012 election cycle, strangely went out of his way to undercut his network\u2019s own star while Palin was deciding whether to enter the 2012 presidential contest. Ailes tried to diminish Palin, publicly saying that he hired her solely because Palin was \u201chot and got ratings.\u201d\u00a0And according to New York magazine\u2019s Gabriel Sherman, Ailes reportedly said behind the scenes that Palin was an \u201cidiot\u201d and \u201cstupid\u201d and did nothing to \u201celevate\u201d the conservative movement even though she had been actively moving the movement away from the corporatism and neoconservatism associated with the Bush dynasty. When Palin decided not to run for president, she returned the favor to Ailes, effectively giving him the middle finger and making her much-anticipated announcement in October of 2011 on Mark Levin\u2019s radio show, royally pissing off Ailes in the process. During the 2016 election cycle, Ailes was just as threatened by Trump. Ailes, according to Sherman, thought Trump was \u201cunelectable\u201d and felt as if he had a duty to \u201csave the country\u201d from Trump. When Megyn Kelly, the talent whom\u00a0Ailes had inexplicably tried to promote as the network\u2019s face, tried to sandbag Trump during the first GOP presidential debate, all hell broke loose. And it was as if Fox News\u2019 viewers who reluctantly gave the network the benefit of the doubt when it attacked Palin, supported amnesty, and hired CNN retreads said, \u201cENOUGH!\u201d As\u00a0Sherman reported, \u201cvirtually 100 percent of the emails were against Megyn Kelly\u201d after the debate, and Ailes was \u201cnot happy\u201d that \u201cmost of the Fox viewers were taking Trump\u2019s side.\u201d Fox News\u2019 battle with Trump showed how out of touch the network\u2019s complacent executives\u00a0were with their core viewers, many of whom watched the network because it was simply the least offensive channel on television where they could get news. As some have semi-jested, Fox News viewers\u00a0even kept their televisions on after Bill O\u2019Reilly\u2019s show and before Sean Hannity\u2019s while they were doing laundry, dishes, housework, or taking out the trash. And in an age when more Americans were getting news from online outlets, Trump showed that Fox News was nowhere near as influential\u00a0as it had been during the last decade before new and social media\u00a0gave voters more ways to get their news In 2010, when the GOP establishment feared Palin would run away with the nomination without having to kowtow to any of them, Barbara Bush threw shade at Palin when she said she hoped Palin would stay in Alaska. \u201cI sat next to her once, thought she was beautiful and I think she\u2019s very happy in Alaska \u2014 and I hope she\u2019ll stay there,\u201d Barbara Bush said. Palin, never afraid to take on the party\u2019s sacred cows, slammed the Bushes for being \u201cblue bloods who want to pick and chose their winners instead of allowing competition to pick and choose the winners.\u201d Radio host Laura Ingraham pointed out then that the \u201celites\u201d like the Bushes were trying to kneecap Palin. Palin also immediately clashed with \u201cBush\u2019s Brain\u201d Karl Rove, Bushism\u2019s top public advocate who reportedly had not \u201cbeen very nice\u201d to Palin \u201cfrom day one\u201d at Fox News, according to Sherman. Make no mistake about it. The Bushes saw Palin as a threat because they knew she would do exactly what Trump ended up doing\u2013eviscerating Bushism. \u00a0In 2016,\u00a0\u201clow energy\u201d and pro-amnesty Jeb Bush\u2019s $100 million war chest could not get him any traction against Trump, who symbolically pummeled him while\u00a0eviscerating any notion that Bushism would be the future of the GOP. While some \u201cNever Trumpers\u201d who never understood Ronald Reagan\u2019s true appeal want to convince people that Trump moved the GOP away from Reaganism, what Trump\u2019s 2016 GOP primary victory and White House victory effectively did was finish what Palin started by driving a stake straight through the heart of Bushism.   After Mitt Romney lost the 2012 election because Reagan Democrats who voted for Obama in 2008 but were disillusioned with Obama four years later could not get themselves to even vote for Romney while holding their noses, the geniuses at Reince Priebus\u2019 and Sean Spicer\u2019s Republican National Committee commissioned a terribly-named \u201cautopsy\u201d report in which the only policy recommendation was amnesty for illegal immigrants. Palin, like Breitbart News, fiercely opposed this nonsense. And she slammed the Gang of Eight\u2019s efforts to pass comprehensive amnesty legislation. She\u00a0was fiercely critical of Obama\u2019s executive amnesties as well. Palin was so lived that she penned an exclusive column for Breitbart News in July of 2014 in which she called for Obama\u2019s impeachment. \u201cNo mas,\u201d she said of Obama\u2019s executive amnesties. On the pages of Breitbart News, Palin blasted Obama\u2019s friendly wealthy bipartisan elite, who she said want \u201ccheap foreign labor and can afford for themselves the best \u2018border security\u2019 money can buy in their own exclusive communities,\u201d for not caring about working-class Americans. \u201cIt\u2019s time to impeach; and on behalf of American workers and legal immigrants of all backgrounds, we should vehemently oppose any politician on the left or right who would hesitate in voting for articles of impeachment,\u201d Palin declared. Palin also said in that Breitbart News column that \u201cwithout borders, there is no nation\u201d and mentioned that many in America now \u201cfeel like strangers in their own land.\u201d As Breitbart News Editor-at-Large Joel Pollak has pointed out, not only did Trump highlight illegal immigration during his presidential launch, Trump rocketed to the top of the GOP field nearly a week after Trump met with the victims of illegal immigrant families after an illegal immigrant murdered Kate Steinle in San Francisco, a city the murderer sought out because it was a sanctuary city. Trump never looked back and his promise to build the wall helped him win over working-class voters in the Rust Belt. In 2015, Breitbart News reported on polling that found that a majority of Americans felt like \u201cstrangers in their own country.\u201d And a post-election study published in the Atlantic magazine found that nearly half of white working-class voters feel like \u201cstrangers in their own land.\u201d Repeatedly on the stump, Trump says that America will not be a country if it does not have borders. Trump won the election while not compromising on illegal immigration, and he even did better among minorities than Romney. In addition, he galvanized working-class white voters, many of whom had either voted for Obama or had not voted in a long time. In fact, a post-election Atlantic/Public Religion Research Institute\u00a0study found that\u00a0that these voters who felt like \u201cstrangers in their own land,\u201d who also felt the \u201cU.S. needs protecting against foreign influence,\u201d were 3.5 times more likely to favor Trump than those who did not share these concerns.  Trump\u2019s celebrity made him a much more powerful candidate than Palin and allowed him to get his message across more effectively and to a wider audience than Palin could have had. It also insulated him better from attacks and criticism while allowing him to more ruthlessly\u00a0attack\u00a0the legacy media. But make no mistake about it, opposing illegal immigration allowed Palin and Trump to galvanize voters who wanted to send a loud and clear message about the importance of melting-pot Americanism (instead of salad-bowl separatism). By supporting Palin and voting for Trump, they were loudly\u2013or silently\u2013voting for E Pluribus Unum (\u201cOut of many, one) instead of Al Gore\u2019s Ex Uno Plures\u00a0(\u201cOut of one, many\u201d).",

We never ever, ever intended it to be gun sights,\u201d SarahPac spokeswoman Rebecca Mansour, now senior West Coast editor at Breitbart News, told ABC News at the time. Palin blasted the media and the Left for trying to smear her as an enabler of a mass-murderer. \u201cIf you don\u2019t like a person\u2019s vision for the country, you\u2019re free to debate that vision.

But, especially within hours of a tragedy unfolding, journalists and pundits should not manufacture a blood libel that serves only to incite the very hatred and violence they purport to condemn. That is reprehensible,\u201d Palin said. Despite further Democratic backlash against Palin\u2019s use of the term\u00a0\u201cblood libel,\u201d then-Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz said Palin\u2019s comments were not at all \u201cimproper.\u201d \u201cThere is nothing improper and certainly nothing anti-Semitic in Sarah Palin using the term [blood libel] to characterize what she reasonably believes are false accusations that her words or images may have caused a mentally disturbed individual to kill and maim,\u201d Dershowitz told Breitbart News\u2019 Big Government. \u201cThe fact that two of the victims are Jewish is utterly irrelevant to the propriety of using this widely-used term.\u201d Griffin said she does \u201cnot condone\u201d violence Tuesday while joking about displaying the president\u2019s severed, bloodied head. \u201cI caption this \u2018there was blood coming out of his eyes, blood coming out of his\u2026 wherever\u2019 Also @tylershields great Photog/film maker,\u201d Griffin tweeted Tuesday.",

      "author": "John Hayward",
      "content": " \u201cI think many of us have called for America to really step up and consider what it is that we are funding and supporting via the UN, and how it works so hard really against U.S. interests, and just saying \u2013 look what the U.K. just did,\u201d Palin said, referring to the Brexit vote. \u201cThis is such an encouraging time, where it\u2019s not just us, but those across the pond, too, are understanding that their nation\u2019s sovereignty and security are on the line here, with the ties that bind us to interests that really don\u2019t further our agendas,\u201d she declared. \u201cSo when the U.K. made its move, it was just another reason to call yet again for the U.S. to get the heck out of the UN and get the UN out of the U.S. Let\u2019s get going on putting America first\u00a0so that we can sweep our own porch before telling other nations how to sweep theirs,\u201d she advised. Palin said it was unnecessary for the United States to import the dysfunctional bureaucracy of the United Nations since homegrown bureaucracy is already doing such a good job of messing up American life. \u201cThey can spy from anywhere, so they don\u2019t need to be right underfoot, the UN, for us to spy on them. We\u2019ll know what they\u2019re doing,\u201d she jovially assured Kassam. \u201cUnfortunately, the UN\u2019s presence even, in the U.S. \u2013 all that has done is said to people like John Kerry and his desire to essentially cave to other countries, he essentially is inviting other countries to exercise veto power over us, over U.S. national security measures,\u201d Palin continued on a more serious note. \u201cHe said during a debate some years ago, he said that our security measures must pass a \u2018global test.\u2019 So the presence of the UN here, unfortunately, just creates more fertile ground for leftist globalists like John Kerry to grow in their desire to make the U.S. continue to fund the lion\u2019s share of this globalist circus \u2013 where bad players, including dictators, they\u2019re going to keep griping, and complaining, and whining, and attacking us for not bending over backwards enough for their liking. Unfortunately, that\u2019s what the UN presence here has been doing,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat does it say about the United States in 2016, at the tail end of 2016, that you have an administration not just willing to stab one of its most important global allies, Israel, in the front, but is being led, supposedly \u2013 listen, I\u2019m going by what they\u2019re saying; they said they didn\u2019t lead, so they have to have been led \u2013 by countries like Venezuela?\u201d Kassam asked. \u201cThat\u2019s a great point,\u201d Palin replied. \u201cI don\u2019t think people have been understanding that \u2013 that either our leaders, unfortunately, are caught lying in regards to orchestrating this non-supportive measure \u2013 to say the least \u2013 of Israel, or yeah, we\u2019ve been led by bad characters that certainly do not have America\u2019s nor Israel\u2019s interests at heart.\u201d \u201cSpeaking of Israel, it\u2019s almost laughable, if it weren\u2019t so dangerous, that the Left now is so obsessed with national borders, obsessed with Israel\u2019s borders,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cTheir defense of what they have just done, in stabbing Israel, is based on their supposed desire to see borders enforced. Since when? They never have seemed to understand the concern that we have, nor the purpose of a nation\u2019s borders. They don\u2019t care about America\u2019s porous borders continuing as is.\u201d Palin said there were two ways to look at how the incoming Trump administration should handle the United Nations. \u201cOne is, I called for our next president, Donald Trump, to call for the unshackling of the political bands tying us to the UN,\u201d she said. \u201cBy exiting the UN, where injustice is actually rewarded, we then will be able to uphold America\u2019s reputation as the leader, and as the kind and compassionate and generous nation that we are \u2013 as the nation sharing values that, when emulated by any other nation, can bring justice and equal rights to any other nation.\u201d \u201cSo I call upon President-elect Trump to lead that charge. But the other way to look at this is, is it really going to be one person, one leader\u2019s responsibility to do so? Or is this going to be part of the revolution that we have just seen, that did elect Trump?\u201d she continued. \u201cIt\u2019s We the People needing to step up and do it. It\u2019s our government. It\u2019s our money funding the lion\u2019s share of the globalist circus. It\u2019s We the People needing to rise up and make this a part of the revolution that we have just so benefited from.\u201d Palin said this urgent need for the people to regain control of national affairs was her most important message at the close of 2016. \u201cOur government, our bureaucrats and our elected leaders, work for us,\u201d she stressed. \u201cWe are the ones that need to call for this, that the UN shackles be next on the chopping block.\u201d \u201cThings that have really resonated with me and I\u2019m sure so many other Americans \u2013 remember back some years ago, when our troops were required to wear the UN insignia on our U.S. uniforms in the military, how really appalling that was?\u201d she recalled. \u201cBecause we know what it is that our troops and our vets have sacrificed for, in order to put America first, so that we can be that bright shining light \u2013 all the good things that America is for the world.\u201d \u201cTo have symbolically an insignia even on our uniforms required, sends that message or paints that picture that we are underneath globalist rule,\u201d Palin argued. \u201cThings like that resonate with me, and I think other average everyday Americans. Things like that are really coming to the forefront now. We\u2019re remembering those things. We\u2019re understanding that there is something we can do about this, in directing our government to get out of an organization that would require such a thing.\u201d Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m.\u00a0to 9:00 a.m.\u00a0Eastern.

      "author": "John Hayward",
      "content": " SirusXM host Alex Marlow asked Palin if she thought divine providence played a role in the election outcome. \u201cNo doubt, divine providence played a huge role in this election,\u201d she replied. \u201cI will boldly proclaim that. I saw it first-hand. I was there on the campaign trail. I saw how things were changing. I saw more and more people\u2019s eyes open, and I think so much of that was based on the church in general, those people of faith who were praying to God that people would wake up.\u201d LISTEN:  \u201cRemember, our Founders dedicated this land, this new country that would be America, this idea of America, dedicated it to God,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cIf I were President, I\u2019d re-dedicate us to God. When I was governor I proclaimed that, the state of Alaska, this is yours, Lord. May your will be done here. We need to do that again in America.\u201d \u201cPrayer warriors across the country, people who perhaps had never expressed their faith in a higher being before, knew that Jeez, we got to\u00a0be on our knees asking for a change here, because we\u2019re going down the wrong road. I was so grateful to see so many people step up in that realm,\u201d Palin said. She added a personal note, something she said she\u2019s never talked about in public before: \u201cI was very grateful to see that the church stepped up, because eight years ago, I felt that they didn\u2019t. Besides the attacks on my family and supporters, the most hurtful thing about the election, the vilification, the marginalization, the ridicule that hit us \u2013 my family and me, eight years ago \u2013 was that I didn\u2019t feel that the church did circle the wagons and step up boldly and say, \u2018What? No, that\u2019s not what she\u2019s saying,\u2019 or \u2018That\u2019s not what she represents.\u2019 Because some of them knew me.\u201d \u201cA lot of these famous pastors, and people all over the country, right after the election were sending me their secret confidential little love notes about, \u2018Oh, you know, my heart was with ya, and you know if there\u2019s ever anything I can do for you, just let me know, because I believe in you, and I believed in you during the election, I\u2019m so sorry what you went through.\u2019 And would sit there reading this stuff, saying, \u2018Well, where were you? Why didn\u2019t you step up? You\u2019re going to\u00a0have to step up next time, or that next person is going to\u00a0go down too,\u201d she remembered sadly. \u201cSo yes, thank God. Literally, I\u2019m thanking God that this go-around, enough pastors, enough congregations, enough people who don\u2019t even ever get in the four walls of a church, but know there is greater purpose in our lives and there is a greater being who has everything in His hands \u2014 more of the Church stepped up, prayed about this very hard (and they need to keep praying about it). They did their job,\u201d Palin concluded. She thought it was fair to ask if there should be career consequences for pundits and analysts who got everything wrong in the long prelude to the 2016 election, especially given their enthusiasm to \u201ccrucify those who get it right.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s just accept that it\u2019s going to go on, and allow then our strength to be made manifest when we realize, okay, they\u2019re going to\u00a0keep getting it wrong, and they\u2019re going to keep trying to crucify us,\u201d she recommended. \u201cSo what? Life\u2019s not fair. There are more of us than there are of them. There really are.\u201d \u201cThey are very vocal, those who want to transform America and take away your freedom of speech. They\u2019re not the majority. The majority of Americans are right on target in where we want to go with liberty and all of our freedoms. So let\u2019s hang on to that, knowing that good, that\u2019s a tool for empowerment right there, is knowing what the numbers are,\u201d she urged.

Adding to\u00a0that assertion, Palin stated, \u201cWhat needs to be discussed is the failure of the FBI. This kid who murdered all these innocent people could not have waved more red flags in front of law enforcement\u2019s face \u2013 all those things that he did with posts, with his threats. Law enforcement called 39 times in the last number of years at his family\u2019s home. There were so many red flags. I\u2019m embarrassed for the FBI. The rank and file guys and gals, they work so hard. It\u2019s the top brass. It\u2019s a matter of priorities in the FBI, and that\u2019s where I think the discussion needs to go.\u201d Since 2010, local law enforcement\u00a0had been called to the family home of shooter Nikolas Cruz, according to CNN: Broward sheriff\u2019s deputies were called to the Cruz family home 39 times since 2010, according to documents obtained by CNN. The sheriff\u2019s office received a range of emergency calls that included reports of a mentally ill person, child/elderly abuse, a domestic disturbance and a missing person. Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel said Friday there were 20 calls for service over the past \u201cfew years\u201d pertaining to Nikolas Cruz. Cruz regularly expressed his interest in violence and mass murder, both online and in person. One acquaintance who knew Cruz from elementary school spoke with Miami\u2019s CBS affiliate: \u201cHe recalled Cruz stealing peoples\u2019 [sic] mail, throwing rocks at cars and tormenting animals. He described one incident in which he said Cruz \u201ccornered a squirrel and was trying to throw rocks at it and kill it.\u201d Cruz also regularly introduced himself to people as \u201ca school shooter.\u201d His online comments include,\u00a0\u201cI wanna shoot people with my AR-15\u201d and \u201cIm going to be a professional school shooter.\u201d Florida Gov. Rick Scott called on FBI Director Christopher Wray to resign for \u201cfailure to take action\u201d to prevent Cruz\u2019s mass murder, issuing\u00a0a\u00a0statement: The FBI\u2019s failure to take action against this killer is unacceptable. The FBI has admitted that they were contacted last month by a person who called to inform them of Cruz\u2019s \u201cdesire to kill people,\u201d and \u201cthe potential of him conducting a school shooting.\u201d Seventeen innocent people are dead and acknowledging a mistake isn\u2019t going to cut it. An apology will never bring these 17 Floridians back to life or comfort the families who are in pain. The families will spend a lifetime wondering how this could happen, and an apology will never give them the answers they desperately need. We constantly promote \u201csee something, say something,\u201d and a courageous person did just that to the FBI. And the FBI failed to act. \u201cSee something, say something\u201d is an incredibly important tool and people must have confidence in the follow through from law enforcement. The FBI director needs to resign. \u201cThis is such a failure. There are\u00a017 people dead, and it could have been prevented,\u201d said Mansour.

      "author": "Joshua Caplan",
      "content": " \u201cHey @LisaMurkowski \u2013 I can see 2022 from my house\u2026,\u201d Palin tweeted.  In one of the most stunning upsets in Alaska political history, Palin defeated the senator\u2019s father Frank Murkowski to become the state\u2019s governor in 2006. Frank Murkowski, a former two-term senator who was elected governor of Alaska, served one term before Palin defeated him in the Republican gubernatorial primary. Palin, who had been appointed to Alaska\u2019s powerful oil and gas commission board by Frank Murkowski, won broad public support from Alaskans due to her record as a reformer and whistleblower who called out the corruption in the Murkowski administration for cronyism with the big oil companies, an action which led to the largest ethics fine in Alaska history. Frank Murkowski also faced criticism for nepotism when he appointed his daughter, Lisa Murkowski, to his vacant U.S. Senate seat. In 2010, Palin, then the former Republican vice-presidential candidate, backed Tea Party Senate challenger Joe Miller over Sen. Lisa Murkowski. Prior to voting against advancing Kavanaugh, Murkowski suggested that she will oppose President Donald Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee this weekend. \u201cI believe that Brett Kavanaugh is a good man. It just may be that in my view he\u2019s not the right man for the court at this time,\u201d Murkowski told reporters on Capitol Hill. She said she respected her colleagues\u2019 support for Kavanaugh, adding, \u201cI also think we\u2019re at a place where we need to think about the credibility and integrity of our institutions.\u201d After remaining undecided on whether Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination should move forward, Murkowski rendered her decision Friday in dramatic fashion. As the clerk read the names in alphabetical order, all eyes were on Murkowski. Senators stood up in their chairs and voted, some of them loudly. But when it came to Murkowski, she stood up, paused, and whispered \u201cno,\u201d her voice barely audible. Then she took her seat, looking down with a stone-faced expression. As the end of the vote neared, Maine Sen. Susan Collins, who sits next to Murkowski, leaned over and put her hand on the arm of Murkowski\u2019s chair. The two huddled in deep conversation. A spokeswoman for Murkowski could not immediately confirm that the senator will oppose Kavanaugh on the final vote expected Saturday, but indicated it appeared that way. Kavanaugh could still win confirmation if Murkowski is the only Republican to oppose him. Murkowski claimed she agonized over her vote, telling reporters she didn\u2019t make up her mind until she walked into the Senate chamber. \u201cThis has truly been the most difficult evaluation of a decision that I\u2019ve ever had to make, and I\u2019ve made some interesting ones in my political career,\u201d she said.

      "author": "Robert Kraychik",
      "content": " \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for Breitbart, so much of our commonsense defense wouldn\u2019t have gotten out there, because I was working for Fox News at the time, and I was not allowed to go on the air to defend myself for days,\u201d Palin said, speaking publicly about this for the first time, during a Friday interview on SiriusXM\u2019s Breitbart News Tonight with Breitbart\u2019s Senior Editor-at-Large Rebecca Mansour. The media firestorm surrounding the 2011 Giffords shooting actually began during the 2010 midterm elections, when Democrats accused Palin of inciting violence\u00a0because her political action committee (PAC), SarahPAC, circulated a map with crosshairs over congressional districts that the\u00a0Republican Party\u00a0hoped to win\u00a0that year. Palin\u2019s graphic highlighted 20 specific swing districts\u00a0that she\u00a0and Sen. John McCain (R-AZ)\u00a0carried in the 2008 presidential race but were represented by a Democrat in Congress. With Palin\u2019s help, Republican candidates successfully won 19 of those 20 districts in the 2010 midterms. The one seat that did not swing to Republicans was held by\u00a0Gabby Giffords, who was shot on January 8, 2011, a few months after winning her re-election bid, when a mentally ill gunman, Jared Loughner, opened fire at a Tucson, Arizona, constituent gathering, wounding Giffords and killing six others. Democrats and their establishment\u00a0media allies cast blame on Palin for the mass shooting. However, as Breitbart Senior Editor-at-Large Joel Pollak reported, the public eventually learned that Giffords\u2019 shooter \u201cwas mentally disturbed and had no political motivations,\u201d and Palin\u2019s map graphic \u201cwas virtually identical to those used by Democrats for years, depicting targets atop contested congressional districts.\u201d \u201cThere is\u00a0no evidence whatsoever\u00a0of political incitement in the Giffords case,\u201d concluded Pollak. Fox News\u2019s\u00a0management denied Palin\u2019s requests to defend herself on the cable\u00a0network\u00a0against the aforementioned slander. And Palin, a Fox News contributor at the time, was also prevented by her strictly enforced employment contract from doing any rival media appearances without prior authorization from Fox management. \u201cI think that that time was our toughest time in this last decade of being out there on a public platform, [with] false accusations that we were to blame for the Gabby Giffords shooting,\u201d said Palin. \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for Breitbart, so much of our commonsense defense wouldn\u2019t have gotten out there, because I was working for Fox News at the time, and I was not allowed to go on the air to defend myself for days, and finally I bucked management of Fox News\u2014I never even talked about this publicly\u2014I bucked management and said, \u2018I\u2019ll do my own video, and I\u2019ll post it, and I\u2019ll explain to people that, no, we are not to blame.\u2019 My relationship with Fox was never the same after that.\u201d Palin noted Ailes\u2019 repeated refusal to allow\u00a0her a platform to defend herself from a barrage of media attacks falsely accusing her of inciting mass murder. \u201cI had asked [Roger Ailes], \u2018How many days do we have to go listening to this with no defense articulated at all? May I please go on the air?\u2019 And he wouldn\u2019t let me,\u201d said Palin. \u201cSo that was a tough time.\u201d Mansour, who worked as a senior aide and speechwriter for Palin at the time, reflected on how Democrats and their news media allies sought to lay blame for the mass murder and attempted assassination of Giffords at the feet of Palin and her staff. \u201cThat whole Gabby Giffords thing,\u201d said Mansour. \u201cIt was one of the worst moments, and we felt like we were besieged by people accusing us falsely, and your heart was just broken, too, because you\u2019re a mom, and you\u2019re watching the people suffering. I know this hits you really hard at home, because you have a big heart. What was interesting, when you look back, is that you have had instances like this again and again with the media, with a vicious media that just targets you and your family and just goes after you for these things.\u201d \u201cAnd I look at President Trump, right now, and the stuff that he faces\u2014and believe me, it\u2019s just awful, the fake news crap\u2014but\u00a0here is my take,\u201d Mansour continued. \u201c[Trump] always had connections with other media figures, he had a lot of money, and an organization defending him. But when you came on the scene, you were just an ordinary American, your family was very middle-class, just ordinary folks, you had risen up from the grassroots as a corruption-buster who was elected governor of Alaska, and you did not have a giant megaphone of people in the establishment media back east [defending you]. So when these people just came at you, it was really very scary, it was like being surrounded. Till this day, I still hear people repeat lies about you, and I\u2019m like, \u2018You have no idea that that\u2019s completely bogus.\u2019 How do feel about this now and what were the lessons learned?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t live by the praise of man so I know I\u2019m not going to die by their criticisms,\u201d said Palin. \u201cSo whatever they say, I don\u2019t care what the critics say.\u201d Palin described the period as trying for her and her family, noting that the intensity and hostility of biased media attacks\u00a0take a toll on even the strongest family. \u201c[I wish] people understood what it does to a family, how it potentially could rip apart a family because everybody has a different idea of how to react to the circumstances around you, and that causes some stress,\u201d said Palin. \u201cI thank God every day that I have a strong family, and we\u2019re doing great. Hopefully our story could inspire people to know that whatever they\u2019re facing, the sun will come out tomorrow and things can get better. It\u2019s just a matter of how you react to sometimes horrible circumstances around you.\u201d \u201cStill to this day, the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0has still alluded to\u00a0[the Giffords shoot] and placed blame,\u201d Palin noted, alluding to a\u00a0New York Times\u00a0op-ed in June of 2017 that again blamed Palin for the 2011 mass shooting in Arizona.\u00a0Palin then\u00a0filed a defamation lawsuit against the Times for\u00a0falsely accusing her of inciting Loughner to shoot Giffords. Mansour recounted how she met Andrew Breitbart and a person the Breitbart News founder described as \u201cone of his really smart friends\u201d for the first time in 2011 when they offered to help Palin and her team. \u201cThat was the first time I met Andrew Breitbart,\u201d said Mansour. \u201cIt was during that time. It was a very troubled time. Our PAC was being falsely implicated in something that had absolutely nothing to do with us \u2026 and it was Andrew Breitbart who offered to help us. He basically came to me and said, \u2018Hey, how can I help? And I want to introduce you to one of my really smart friends who\u2019s going to help you, too, and by the way, his name is Joel Pollak.\u2019 And that was how I first met Joel Pollak.\u201d Seven years later, Pollak would become Mansour\u2019s co-host on SiriusXM\u2019s Breitbart News Tonight.

      "author": "Robert Kraychik",
      "content": " \u201cIt really makes me nervous that there seems to be some enthusiasm for the U.S. to interject ourselves again in a foreign country\u2019s battles when no one has articulated yet what our interest is there,\u201d\u00a0Palin said. \u201cWe should have learned our lesson with Iraq and Afghanistan. I look at it as the blood, the sweat, the toil that has been spent on our end when you can\u2019t really see what the gain is in a lot of respects. We just can\u2019t allow ourselves get back in that mode with Syria.\u201d LISTEN: Palin warned of advocacy for military operations in Syria rooted in financial self-interest. She stated, \u201cI hate to say it, but a lot of the talk that\u2019s enthusiastic about war, unfortunately, comes from people with strong ties to defense contractors and have strong ties to those who ultimately can make money on the operations. So often you got to follow the money and that leads you to what the root is of some of these arguments.\u201d Palin called for an articulation of the American national interest in Syria prior to any military operations within the Levantine state: So those making this point that we need to insert our power and get in there and get rid of Assad, I\u2019m not comfortable with it and American citizens should not be comfortable with this until there is very focused articulated reasons provided to us and Congress \u2014 and Congress need to be a part of this, too, not just the administration \u2014 until we find out what the heck we would be doing there.\u00a0There has to be avoidance of the short-sighted decision-making. Palin continued, \u201cUntil we are given the reasons why it\u2019s in America\u2019s best interests, why in the world we would be willing to sacrifice even one of our sons or daughters who will be sent over there? It\u2019s like that old saying, the old men call war, and they send the young men to go fight them. No. I see what war does to an individual, to a family. I guess there\u2019s a lot of humanity that I\u2019m considering at this point.\u201d Palin added, \u201cYeah, America is the strongest fighting power on the globe \u2014 and we should be \u2014 but being prepared with that, being the strongest, should create an environment of peace. That\u2019s what Reagan used to preach.\u201d On Monday, Fox News Channel\u2019s Tucker Carlson similarly questioned the wisdom of calls to oust Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Also on Monday, Pat Buchanan dubbed Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), John McCain (R-AZ), and Marco Rubio (R-FL) \u2014 advocates of toppling Assad \u2014 as members of \u201cthe war party.\u201d Breitbart News Tonight\u00a0broadcasts live\u00a0Monday through Friday on SiriusXM\u2019s Patriot channel 125 from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern (6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Pacific).

      "subtitle": "On Tuesday evening, former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin hired Hulk Hogan\u2019s lawyers and sued the New York Times for defamation for falsely accusing her in a June 14 editorial of inciting Jared Lee Loughner to shoot Rep. Gabby Giffords (D-AZ). The Times\u2019 editorial was published on the day that James Hodgkinson shot House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA) while he was practicing for the Congressional Baseball Game with his GOP teammates.",
      "author": "Tony Lee",
      "content": " \u201cToday, Sarah Palin took a stand against The New York Times Company by filing a lawsuit which seeks to hold The Times accountable for stating that Governor Palin is part of a \u2018sickeningly familiar pattern\u2019 of politically motivated violence and that she incited the horrific 2011 shooting of Representative Gabby Giffords, a tragedy where the gunman seriously wounded numerous people and killed 6, including a federal judge and a 9-year-old girl,\u201d Palin\u2019s lawyers\u2014Ken Turkel, Shane Vogt, and S. Preston Ricardo\u2014said in a statement. The complaint, filed in Manhattan federal court in the Southern District of New York, states that \u201cat the time of publication, The Times knew and had published pieces acknowledging that there was no connection between Mrs. Palin and Loughner\u2019s 2011 shooting.\u201d \u201cIn doing so, The Times violated the law and its own policies,\u201d it reads. Messrs. Turkel, Vogt, and Ricardo said Palin \u201cseeks to hold The Times to its November 13, 2016, pledge [\u2018to rededicate itself to reporting facts honestly and holding power to account\u2019], and to face both journalistic and financial accountability for the false statements that it published about Mrs. Palin.\u201d As Breitbart News previously noted, Palin indicated on Twitter that she was \u201cconsidering suing the New York Times for libel\u201d the day after the Times published its editorial even though \u201cit has long been established that there has never been any evidence whatsoever linking Palin to the attempted assassination.\u201d   Here is what the Times originally wrote in its editorial: Was this attack evidence of how vicious American politics has become? Probably. In 2011, when Jared Lee Loughner opened fire in a supermarket parking lot, grievously wounding Representative Gabby Giffords and killing six people, including a 9-year-old girl, the link to political incitement was clear. Before the shooting, Sarah Palin\u2019s political action committee circulated a map of targeted electoral districts that put Ms. Giffords and 19 other Democrats under stylized cross hairs. The Times, after much public backlash from even Palin\u2019s harshest\u00a0critics on the left and right, then issued two subsequent corrections. After adding that \u201cno connection to the shooting was ever established\u201d to its original editorial, the Times issued this correction on June 15: An earlier version of this editorial incorrectly stated that a link existed between political incitement and the 2011 shooting of Representative Gabby Giffords. In fact, no such link was established. But the Times never corrected that it had falsely stated that Palin had put \u201cGiffords and 19 other Democrats under stylized cross hairs\u201d when Palin did no such thing. Later in the day on June 15, the Times edited its editorial again to note that Palin\u2019s map \u201cshowed the targeted electoral districts of Ms. Giffords and 19 other Democrats under stylized cross hairs.\u201d It then issued its second correction: The editorial also incorrectly described a map distributed by a political action committee before that shooting. It depicted electoral districts, not individual Democratic lawmakers, beneath stylized cross hairs. Yet, in a statement to CNN, the Times insisted that their errors did not \u201cundercut or weaken the argument of the piece.\u201d Palin\u2019s lawyers pointed out that \u201cdespite recognizing that its statements about Mrs. Palin in the June 14, 2017 column \u2018America\u2019s Lethal Politics\u2019 are not true, The Times repeatedly failed to meaningfully retract or correct its column and apologize to Mrs. Palin for publishing it. Rather, The Times issued a statement affirming that its \u2018error doesn\u2019t undercut or weaken the argument of the piece.\u2019\u201d To prove that the Times had \u201cample facts available that established that there was no connection between Mrs. Palin and Loughner\u2019s crime,\u201d the lawyers point to an article the Times published on January 15, 2011, that \u201crecognized that no direct or clear link between political rhetoric and Loughner\u2019s actions could be claimed.\u201d In addition, the lawyers point out that New York Times columnist Charles Blow once wrote that \u201cthe only problem is that there was no evidence then, and even now, that overheated rhetoric from the right had anything to do with the shooting\u201d of Giffords. The lawyers also refer to Blow\u2019s column, \u201cShe Who Must Not Be Named,\u201d\u00a0that was critical of the left\u2019s and the establishment press\u2019s continued coverage of Palin. In Blow\u2019s column, he asks, \u201cWhat purpose does it serve other than inflaming passions to drive viewership and Web clicks?\u201d The complaint points out that Blow\u2019s \u201ccolumn acknowledges that there is existing hostility held toward\u00a0Mrs. Palin, and also recognizes that her name and attacks upon her inflame passions and thereby drive viewership and Web clicks to media companies.\u201d \u201cThe Times published the Palin Article with actual knowledge that stories attacking Mrs. Palin inflame passions, which drives viewership and Web clicks,\u201d the complaint further reads. \u201cThus, The Times knowingly and voluntarily exploited and retained a benefit conferred by Mrs. Palin, in special circumstances particular to this case in which it would be inequitable for The Times to retain that benefit without paying the value thereof to Mrs. Palin.\u201d Palin\u2019s attorneys argue that the Times\u2019\u00a0\u201cconduct was committed knowingly, intentionally, willfully, wantonly and maliciously, with the intent to harm Mrs. Palin, or in blatant disregard of the substantial likelihood of causing her harm, thereby entitling Mrs. Palin to an award of punitive damages.\u201d Two of Palin\u2019s lawyers\u2013Messrs. Turkel and Vogt\u2013successfully represented Hulk Hogan in his $140 million invasion of privacy suit against Gawker after Gawker published Hogan\u2019s sex tape. As noted on the firm\u2019s website, they \u201cconvinced a Pinellas County jury to award Terry Bollea, professionally known as Hulk Hogan, $55 million in economic damages and another $60 million in damages for emotional distress. The jury awarded an additional $25.1 million in punitive damages, making the verdict one of the largest contested verdicts in Pinellas County history.\u201d 01 \u2013 Complaint W-o Exhibits (00125593xBEB76) by Breitbart News on Scribd ",

      "content": " The GOP establishment in Congress is our abuser. We can\u2019t hide the black eyes any more. The whole neighborhood knows. The Democrats are\u00a0gloating. Obama\u00a0thanked\u00a0Paul Ryan\u00a0effusively \u2013 and why shouldn\u2019t he? Nancy Pelosi couldn\u2019t have given him more. And where was the famed House Freedom Caucus \u2013 those stalwart conservatives who spearheaded Boehner\u2019s ouster? They were\u00a0shrugging\u00a0and handing us a bag of frozen peas to put on our black eye. If we\u2019re lucky, maybe they\u2019ll call 911 for us when\u00a0the beating starts up again. This is shameful, and it has to end.\u00a0No mas! For the last seven years, grassroots conservatives rallied to action under the belief that change starts at the ballot box. As I\u2019ve said many times: there is nothing wrong with this country that a good old-fashioned election can\u2019t fix. People put their own lives on hold to send these Republicans to Congress to take back control of the House and Senate, to get a handle on our bankrupt federal government, and put America on the right track. I think of all the cross-country redeye flights I took away from my young son in order to campaign for Republican candidates, so full of promises, over the years. Others gave up a lot more than I did to elect a \u201cconservative\u201d majority. Together, we grassroots conservatives gave the GOP historic electoral victories because they promised us they would stop Obama\u2019s \u201cfundamental transformation of America.\u201d Instead, they\u00a0abetted\u00a0it. They are Obama\u2019s accomplices. With this omnibus bill, they broke every promise they made to us.\u00a0Every single one. They\u2019ve reached a level of brazen duplicity previously known only to Democrats. Obamacare? It\u2019s fully funded. Planned Parenthood, which was caught red-handed haggling over the sale of dead babies? It\u2019s funded too. Obama\u2019s illegal executive amnesty? Funded. Illegal alien sanctuary cities? Funded. Visas for un-vetted Muslim migrants (\u201crefugees\u201d) to resettle in America? Funded. Obama\u2019s green energy crony capitalism? Funded. Tax credits for illegal aliens? Funded. H-2B visas to replace American workers with cheap unskilled foreign workers? Yep, that\u2019s in there too. What about funds for the fence that we so desperately need on our southern border? Nope, sorry, they couldn\u2019t find any money for that. Basically, everything commonsense conservatives\u00a0despise \u2013\u00a0and Republicans promised to put an end to if elected \u2013 was funded by this omnibus. They weren\u2019t worried about the promises they made to us. This omnibus was written by lobbyists for lobbyists and passed by corrupted\u00a0politicians fulfilling promises to these cronies with deep pockets. They campaigned one way, then governed another way. This is why people hate politics and politicians. This is why they tune out and stay home. Reading\u00a0through chunks of this bloated spending bill that drives us further into bankruptcy I steamed, \u201cThat\u2019s it. They can\u2019t be trusted. I\u2019m outta here because they do not stand on the planks of the GOP platform, not one iota.\u201d But you know what, my fellow conservatives \u2013\u00a0that\u2019s what the GOP establishment wants us to do! They want us to leave the Party or just sit out elections. Without us around, their handpicked puppets can be elected in gerrymandered districts without any pesky conservative primary challengers. The Congressional GOP establishment doesn\u2019t care about winning national elections. As far as they\u2019re concerned, Hillary can have the White House \u2013 just so long as they can keep their cushy jobs on Capitol Hill. In fact, having a Democrat in the White House is probably good for business. They don\u2019t want to have to lead on anything \u2013 they\u2019ve had ample opportunity to do so! \u2013 \u00a0and a Democrat president is a nice foil for them. They can enjoy the status quo, enjoy all the crony capital cash, enjoy the perks of office, and as the country continues to crash and burn, they can tell the folks back home it\u2019s all President Hillary\u2019s fault. Thankfully, not everyone with an \u201cR\u201d after their name is happy with the corrupt status quo. And there are a lot more good guys in Congress now thanks to the Tea Party. So, no, it\u2019s not time\u00a0to leave the GOP. We\u2019re going to make our abusers leave. We\u2019re not going to let them hit us again. It\u2019s time to kick our abusers out of the House, change the locks, and keep a loaded shotgun next to the bed.",

      "author": "Sarah Palin",
      "content": " Marion Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen is the new deserved \u201cIt Girl\u201d of French politics and a clear voice of courage and common sense in a country and continent in need of both. In 2012, she earned the distinction of being France\u2019s youngest elected Member of Parliament. Last week she handily won the first round of a race for the leadership of a large important region in southeastern France that\u2019s home to the beautiful port city of Marseilles. Unfortunately, she lost the run-off election today because the two establishment Parties joined forces to defeat her. But despite today\u2019s tough losses, Marion and her aunt Marine Le Pen, the leader of the National Front (FN) Party, have established themselves and their supporters as a force to be reckoned with in France\u2019s 2017 presidential race, in which Marine is sure to be a contender with her talented niece right behind her. For some time now, I\u2019ve admired the bold style of Marine Le Pen, who wrestled control of the leadership of her populist party in order to purge it of any trace of anti-Semitism, which it had unfortunately been tainted with in the past. But I\u2019m especially impressed with the courage of her young niece who is a devout Catholic and unapologetically pro-life \u2013 not an easy thing for a politician to be in a country that\u2019s aggressively secular. More importantly, young Marion Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen is unashamed to champion France\u2019s Judeo-Christian identity and heritage as something worth preserving and fighting for. She publicly proclaims it, setting an example for even American politicians to be so bold. With France (and indeed all of Europe) caught up in an existential crisis against radical Islam, these are the sentiments they need in their leadership. The Charlie Hebdo attacks last January and the Paris attacks last month were a tragic wake up call for France. The forces of civilization are engaged in a great war against the Death Cult that is radical Islam. This year the conflict reached the shores of France, which has become the Western Front of this Great War, thanks in part to the migrant crisis overwhelming the European Union. Was anyone surprised that the mastermind of the Paris attacks entered the country by posing as a Syrian \u201crefugee\u201d? The Islamic State bragged that they were going to exploit Europe\u2019s open borders! Is this not the clearest warning to politically correct pundits and politicians in our own homeland who think we can filter the nefarious out from the future flood of young, strong, able-bodied immigrants claiming \u201crefugee\u201d status? It\u2019s common sense to encourage these young men to stay and fight for their countries and families during this time made tumultuous in part by our utter lack of border security and vetting processes. The migrant crisis has made a mockery of any idea of national sovereignty. The EU\u2019s open border policy means that all of Europe is now forced to bear the burden of Germany\u2019s insane decision to welcome in those untold millions of mostly fighting age young Muslim men who have zero interest in assimilating to secular western values, as heretofore mentioned. To this, Marion Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen declares that France is not an Islamic land, but Muslims are welcome to become French citizens \u201conly on condition that they bend to the customs and the way of life that Greek, Roman and 16 centuries of Christianity fashioned.\u201d What she\u2019s saying should not be controversial. It\u2019s common sense. The western values enjoyed by every French citizen regardless of their religion are necessarily rooted in those 16 Christian centuries. Our understanding of human rights and human dignity comes from the Judeo-Christian worldview that shaped modern Europe. If you transplant to your shores a foreign population that\u2019s hostile to the very things your country stands for, you won\u2019t have a country for very long. This is the hard truth. You can\u2019t maintain a peaceful liberal democracy with people who want to impose Sharia law on you. But for some reason saying this out loud is considered \u201chate speech\u201d or xenophobia in Europe. They can even press criminal charges against you for it! We see members of a Death Cult gun down Parisians in a\u00a0caf\u00e9 and concert hall, slaughter cartoonists at their desks, shoot up a Jewish market, sell women and girls into sexual slavery, stone gays to death, crucify and behead Christians, and declare their intention to infiltrate and destroy western countries. But the Left reserves its harshest criticism not for the murderous Death Cult, but for any leader offering commonsense solutions to curtail the terrorists\u2019 ability to wage war on the innocent. The Left wraps itself in political correctness and multiculturalism like a suicide vest. They\u2019d rather blow up the whole country than admit the stupidity of thinking a nation can remain the same after inviting in millions of people who despise its values. I guess it\u2019s not surprising really. The Left in Europe and America has always had a self-destructive hatred for the things that make a country great and worth living in: free markets, free speech, a civil society grounded in Judeo-Christian values, a strong national defense, and sovereign borders. They\u2019re constantly attacking every one of these things. That\u2019s undeniable. But their dangerous ideology is being \u201cmugged by reality.\u201d People are waking up. Young Marion Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen built her electoral win last week by going to the rural small business owners \u2013 the average French citizens who have been ignored by their elite politicians and have had enough. We see the same thing happening here in America. Call it the rise of the populists. Pundits are already seeing the similarities between Marion and Marine Le Pen, Donald Trump, and Ted Cruz. All are non-establishment candidates taking on corrupt, entrenched, and detached political elites who are more interested in preserving their own power than in defending their countries. It\u2019s time to wake up, America. Nowhere in Europe or America is safe from this Great War against the Death Cult. San Bernardino wasn\u2019t a one-off phenomenon. ISIS is already here. According to a House Homeland Security report, over 250 people in the U.S. have attempted to join ISIS (that we know about), and 82 have been caught in ISIS plots. Meanwhile, the FBI has nearly 1,000 open cases involving ISIS that we know of. We don\u2019t have a handle on this situation now, but our insane politicians want to import more so-called \u201crefugees.\u201d Forgive me if I\u2019m a little skeptical about the refugee part. We just learned that ISIS is forging fake Syrian passports, and we already know that two of the Paris attackers entered Europe posing as refugees. We have no way to vet anyone coming to our country. This is why we need to seal the borders. And we must\u00a0speak candidly about the need for those coming here to assimilate to our values, as immigrants have always done in the past. Our country isn\u2019t 16 centuries old, but our Founders were under the influence of nearly\u00a018 centuries\u00a0of Judeo-Christian thought and time-tested truths when they drafted our Constitution. We would do well to remember that our Constitution is incompatible with Sharia, and anyone who wants to live under Sharia should settle elsewhere. When Marion Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen speaks of France\u2019s 16 centuries of Judeo-Christian history and heritage, her rhetoric isn\u2019t about \u201chate\u201d or xenophobia. It\u2019s about love \u2013 that deep love of country we call patriotism. Mark Twain believed patriotism was personified in the story of a young French woman who \u201cfound a great nation lying in chains, helpless and hopeless\u201d and led it \u201cfrom victory to victory\u201d until it was free. \u201cWith Joan of Arc love of country was more than a sentiment \u2013 it was a passion,\u201d Twain wrote. \u201cShe was Patriotism embodied.\u201d As Marion faces the political battles ahead, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she says a prayer to France\u2019s Patron Saint, for Marion is a reminder of her \u2013 Joan of Arc.",

      "author": "Patrick Howley",
      "content": " A former Republican congressman tells Breitbart News that top Wisconsin Republican power brokers, including Scott Walker and Reince Preibus, are using Cruz to beat Trump here so that they can broker the convention to pick Wisconsin\u2019s own Paul Ryan as the nominee. With 72 hours to go until Tuesday\u2019s primary, Trump and Palin braved the April snow to speak with urgency about their mission to defeat Cruz, who is backed by conservative movement activists as well as out-of-state Establishment types.\u00a0The Cruz campaign says that they\u2019ve seen no visible evidence of a Trump ground game or volunteer operation in the state. So Trump is relying on big rallies in front of packed crowds in auditorium halls. \u201cPeople say, I like Trump and I like Cruz. It\u2019s not even a fair comparison. I\u2019m so much better,\u201d Trump said at a rally in Wausau, mocking Washington lobbyists with \u201cCruz\u201d tattoos on their foreheads as he stood in front of a group of teenage guys in faux-Pink Floyd T-shirts bearing\u00a0the slogan \u201cTrump\u2019s Wall.\u201d \u201cBelieve me, they have him. They have him, folks,\u201d Trump said of Cruz\u2019s lobbyists. Both Trump and Palin made a fair share of Green Bay Packers references, telling anecdotes about Packers legends Jerry Kramer and Vince Lombardi (and reminding this reporter of Hunter S. Thompson\u2019s classic assessment upon meeting popular Silent Majority president Richard Nixon:\u00a0\u201cIt wasn\u2019t his factual knowledge of football that stunned me; it was his genuine interest in the game.\u201d) Trump also made kids in the audience raise their hands and promise never to do drugs. \u201cI won\u2019t say no alcohol, but take it easy on the alcohol,\u201d he added. \u201cOnce you get hooked on the alcohol or the drugs, it makes your life very hard. And if you never start taking it, you won\u2019t get hooked.\u201d  \u201cI hope I have some good years left, and I want to give back to the country. I just want to give something back. That\u2019s all it is\u2026This is an opportunity that is so awe-inspiring, to be president of the United States \u2026 If we don\u2019t make the country rich again, you\u2019re going to have your Social Security cut by Cruz and Kasich.\u201d \u201cWe have some areas that look like it\u2019s just uniform Trump, and we have others that we\u2019re actually campaigning in a little bit to see if we can get them over,\u201d Trump said. In Racine, Trump stood on stage, reading off numbers from a page of Wisconsin budget and job statistics, and said of himself, rather tellingly, \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s self-funded really since Ross Perot.\u201d \u201cWisconsin has to keep wages very depressed, if you don\u2019t keep wages depressed you\u2019re not going to hold your jobs. Which tells you, you have the wrong kinds of jobs, folks, I hate to tell you. We\u2019ll bring the jobs back that you\u2019re going to want to make a little money with.\u201d \u201cThe people get it. The people, the people, the people, really understand. The people really understand.\u201d Palin, meanwhile, took dead aim at Cruz. \u201cThese paid political hacks and consultants running these other guys\u2019 campaigns who have a track record of losing and losing and losing. But somebody\u2019s such a sucker, they keep hiring the guys and paying them hundreds of thousands of dollars to advise them on campaigns. Well, it\u2019s not going to do him any good.\u201d Will these rallies help Trump gain on Cruz, who is leading by ten points? Only time will tell. But other signs around the state are pointing to very positive things for Cruz: The Establishment Is Teaming Up With Cruz \u2014 At Least For Now Trump is fighting against Wisconsin\u2019s governor Scott Walker, who endorsed Cruz, but the problem for Trump is bigger than Walker. \u201cI think this is a three-corner bank shot. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s that much of a lovefest for Ted Cruz, but they\u2019re just using him to keep Trump below 1,237 delegates so they can broker the convention for Paul Ryan,\u201d former congressman Scott Klug told Breitbart News. \u201cReince is very close to Ryan, and Walker is very close to Ryan, so I think it starts there. I know Wisconsin politics well and I know the players well and I think this is well orchestrated,\u201d Klug said. \u201cThey had the opportunity to volunteer for the Cruz campaign for a long time, but it\u2019s only happened in the last couple days.\u201d The Washington-based Club for Growth PAC is running a TV ad in the state that makes perfectly clear why Ted Cruz is all of a sudden getting the support of Mitt Romney, Lindsey Graham, Jeb Bush, and other people who never would have endorsed him in a million years had Trump not gotten into the race. If people vote for Ted Cruz, then the party can stop Trump from getting 1,237 delegates, and then the Republicans can broker the convention in Cleveland, where Cruz will be on his own on the second ballot. Cruz is already racing to win a second-ballot majority among delegates in order to stave off an Establishment power play that could see Paul Ryan or another candidate step in to take the nomination. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVNOu00vYpM Trump attacked the Club for Growth\u2019s numbers-minded antics. Trump challenged the group\u2019s math.   Cruz Has A Highly Organized Ground Game \u201cCruz is doing well in the Milwaukee suburbs, where about 40 percent of the raw numbers in Wisconsin come out of,\u201d former Republican congressman Scott Klug told Breitbart News. \u201cThe northern towns, the rural part of the state, that\u2019s where Trump\u2019s strength is \u2026 I\u2019d be stunned if Cruz doesn\u2019t win the First, which is Ryan\u2019s district.\u201d Milwaukee-area conservative radio hosts like Charlie Sykes are hammering away at Trump, and activists are hitting the ground. Heidi Cruz and Carly Fiorina have teamed up to barnstorm around the state, riling up volunteers at the campaign\u2019s more than thirty makeshift offices in the state. On a snowy day this week in Wausau, Heidi and Carly showed up to greet about fifty people in a crowded rental unit on the outskirts of town. Heidi was professional to a tee, doggedly going from handshake to handshake with the predominately elderly and older middle-aged group. \u201cTed is so great at standing up for what we believe in,\u201d Heidi said when asked casually if she was getting tired of the campaign trail, adding that Ted\u2019s passion keeps them both energized. Another woman told Heidi that she was praying for Ted. Heidi thanked her. \u201cAnd thank you for putting action to all these prayers too, because we have packed offices all over the state,\u201d Heidi added, concluding that she believes her husband will win Wisconsin. The people there were perfectly friendly but also symptomatic of the Midwestern distaste for coastal outsiders, mocking among themselves Donald Trump\u2019s orange face. A particularly entrepreneurial 17-year-old volunteer named Bethany Torstenson said that she aspires to one day be a \u201clittle like\u201d each of the more constitutionally-inclined Republican candidates, \u201cexcept for Trump.\u201d She says, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be part of the circus.\u201d Trump\u2019s East Coast Style\u00a0Does Not Adapt Easily Here Let\u2019s say you\u2019re a reporter from the East Coast (a fiscally conservative one) and you show up to a bar in Madison, Wisconsin wearing a suit sans tie. A guy might look at you and say \u201cI hear the [stock] market is up!\u201d while other people in the bar look away from you. The bartender might not come over to serve you right away. And then you take the hint and leave. No, Wisconsin is not filled to the brim with such mean-spirited hipsters, but people throughout the state \u2014 like in Iowa \u2014 do\u00a0have a fundamental distrust for people from the East Coast. Who from the deep Midwest can try to deny it? Fast-talking New Yorkers are viewed with suspicion at best. A candidate talking about his \u201cwinning\u201d poll numbers all the time is considered tacky. A lot of people in Wisconsin \u2014 from the well-represented Bernie Sanders Left to the pro-Cruz Religious Right \u2014 really, really, really don\u2019t like Donald Trump. Consider the states where Trump has won his most significant victories. Trump, the redheaded Scots-Irish candidate, won New Hampshire as well as Alabama, Massachusetts alongside South Carolina. These are East Coast people, and whether they\u2019re in New England or the Deep South, many of them are Catholics or at least rooted in the fiery Scotch-Irish tradition. Trump has consistently led the Republican field among Catholics. Trump\u00a0leads Hillary Clinton among Catholics,\u00a0even though a substantial plurality of Catholics are Democrats. The Germanic Protestants of Wisconsin, raised in a modest culture like in Iowa (where Trump only got 24 percent in a loss), are wary of Trump. They don\u2019t like the bombast. They don\u2019t like the ego. They don\u2019t like the circus. And they really don\u2019t like New York. How about Lutherans, whose presence in Wisconsin makes it one of the top Lutheran states alongside Minnesota and North and South Dakota? Forget it. Trump draws Lutheran peace protesters. It\u2019s not his personality type. Also,\u00a0Wisconsin is a predominately white state that has very few Mexicans in it (as of 2008, Hispanics made up only five percent of the state and were mostly found in clusters). Therefore, the idea of a border wall with Mexico is removed from the experience and concerns of most of these people. Don\u2019t expect immigration to have anywhere near the impact in Wisconsin that it had in Arizona, where Trump won in a landslide. Breitbart News will continue to monitor all of the events leading up to Tuesday\u2019s Wisconsin primary.",

      "author": "Matthew Boyle",
      "content": " Ryan introduced what he calls the \u201cAmerican Health Care Act,\u201d a bill that does not repeal Obamacare but only amends it. For the last several days, senior Republicans ranging from members of the House Freedom Caucus to other House Republicans to Sens. Tom Cotton (R-AR), Rand Paul (R-KY), Mike Lee (R-UT), and more have raised serious concerns with the bill. Some call it Obamacare 2.0, others call it Obamacare Lite or Ryan-care, and now Palin\u2014in her first interview on the topic, coming on Breitbart News Saturday on SiriusXM 125 the Patriot Channel this weekend\u2014calls it \u201cRINO-Care.\u201d \u201cI do want to speak about this, but I am tempted to say not another word from our fearless leaders about this new form of Obamacare that I\u2019m going to call RINO-care\u2014not another word from them until we are definitively told that there is no provision whatsoever allowing Congress to exempt itself whatsoever with this law,\u201d Palin said. \u201cAs with anything else mandated by Congress, every single dotted I and crossed T better apply to them, too, and not just the people who they are lording this thing over because remember this is government-controlled health care, the system that requires enrollment in an unaffordable, unsustainable, unwanted, unconstitutional continuation of government-run medicine, and even in this new quasi-reformed proposal, there is still an aspect of socialism. That\u2019s the whole premise here.\u201d Palin expressed serious concern with the fact that Ryan\u2019s healthcare bill does not eliminate Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate. It just shifts the mandate\u2014which requires all Americans to purchase a health insurance plan even if they do not want one. Under Obamacare, those who do not comply, pay a tax to the federal government. Under Ryan\u2019s plan, those who not comply, pay a fee to the insurance companies. \u201cThis 30 percent additional fee will be collected by some in the private sector, which will mean politicians are allowed again to pick the winners and losers, and it makes you wonder who\u2019s lobbying hardest for aspects of this new bill because obviously there are special interests involved. Otherwise, certain private sector segments of our economy wouldn\u2019t be rewarded as they will be with this fee, instead of going to the IRS going to private companies,\u201d Palin said. \u201cIt would be really helpful if every single one of these politicians would do like the NASCAR drivers do\u2014and it\u2019s been said before\u2014but let them wear their sponsors plastered all over their three-piece suits when they show up so we know what side they\u2019re on and who they\u2019re actually doing their bidding for.\u201d At this time, House GOP leadership officials are refusing to answer which lobbyists specifically were involved in writing the bill and which lobbyists wrote which parts of the legislation. Palin told Breitbart News that it\u2019s a \u201cgreat question\u201d for leadership officials that they should answer because the public deserves to know. \u201cThat\u2019s a great question. That\u2019s a great question,\u201d Palin said when informed of the fact that House GOP leaders have refused to answer which lobbyists were involved in writing the legislation. \u201cThe people want to know with this RINO-Care, we know that it helps Big pharma and big lobbyists who need big government to stay in business. We want to and have the right to know who\u2019s actually putting pen to paper and writing this because we know the politicians don\u2019t write the laws.\u201d Palin also praised Cotton and Paul and Rep. Dave Brat (R-VA), among others, who are standing up and pushing back on this rush from leadership on this bill. She says that they are \u201cright\u201d in pushing to make sure the process is not rushed in the way that Ryan has been rushing it through the House so far. In fact, this past week, the House Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means Committees stayed in session all night to ram the bill down to the next stages, rather than taking input from the American people and slowly deliberating the process of healthcare reform. \u201cCotton is right. Dr. Rand Paul is right. Dave Brat is right. Some of these public servants are right in saying, \u2018Let\u2019s do it right this time\u2019 because, remember, the rush job under Obamacare gave us what we\u2019re having to deal with today, which is the devastating system that is again lorded over us,\u201d Palin said. \u201cThey passed it with their rushed-through process of theirs. It\u2019s very important that the people are allowed to see what\u2019s in the bill before its first draft so we know what their thinking is, so we know what the difference is between Obamacare and RINO-Care.\u201d \u201cBut we can\u2019t lose sight of the entire premise between the whole pro-Obamacare and the pro-RINO-care arguments,\u201d she continued. \u201cIt\u2019s so wrong because it\u2019s still so unconstitutional. It\u2019s still taxation without representation. It still picks winners and losers because some corporations get to opt out of the requirements that hit everyone else. It still infringes on states\u2019 rights, and it still weaponizes the IRS against Americans who just simply seek freedom and choices and sensibility in their families\u2019 health care. The IRS will be taxing aspects of this without representation because we have no choice. We\u2019re shackled to politicians\u2019 whims and special interests\u2019 bullying interests, which does violate the Constitution, and it actually allows government to have a lien on our health.\u201d \u201cPeople need to know it\u2019s the foundation, it\u2019s the premise,\u201d Palin said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why we\u2019re still even giving an inch on aspects of socialized medicine via this new RINO-care proposal. Is that okay with conservatives, with Republicans in office? They say they want the patient first. They say they want freedom. They say they want a free market to drive the insurance system that we have in America. But no, government is still in control. Government actually has a lien on our health because they lord over us penalties if we want to opt out of a big government mandate.\u201d When asked what she would say to Ryan if he were on Breitbart News Saturday with her this weekend\u2014Ryan has refused to come on the program to discuss these matters and will not answer Breitbart News\u2019s questions about the\u00a0bill \u2014Palin said she has lots for Ryan to explain here. But she also noted that Republicans party-wide agree that Obamacare is awful and needs to be repealed. \u201cThere is much that we agree on,\u201d Palin said. \u201cThank the Lord, we all agree that Obamacare is devastating one-sixth of our economy. That\u2019s what health care encompasses. Once the government took it over\u2014it obviously is unaffordable, unsustainable and unwanted. So, from the get-go, thank the Lord we all have that in common, and we want to do away with Obamacare. I would ask Paul Ryan\u2019s forgiveness if I come across sounding like I\u2019m just whining and complaining about a problem without proposing a solution. Like Teddy Roosevelt said, that is the definition of whining. So I want to propose solutions, and I want Paul Ryan to listen to the people who are suggesting that, okay, if government is going to be this involved in our healthcare system and choices, then allow the states to take this over. Get it out of big government\u2019s hands. The most responsive level of government is that which is closest to the people. If you\u2019re not going to allow individuals to have the freedoms and the autonomy and the choices provided in their health care, at least let it be a states\u2019 rights issue. So that\u2019s one.\u201d \u201cAnd then let\u2019s talk about the tort reform that I still don\u2019t see in the new proposal,\u201d Palin continued. \u201cI\u2019d like Paul Ryan to address that more clearly. I\u2019d like him to really talk about how he proposes to tackle the waste and the fraud in the healthcare system. I\u2019d really like him to talk about the interstate commerce allowance now because we know that that has caused a lack of competition, and I really want him to address just that good old American freedom of choice. How can he convince the American people that this isn\u2019t just still big government in bed with big pharma and big Wall Street and sticking it to the people with all its globaloney that was part of Obamacare. How is this RINO-care any different?\u201d Palin concluded the interview by noting that she has the utmost confidence that President Trump will move to scrap Ryan\u2019s bill and fix this whole process before this gets out of hand. \u201cHe will step in and fix it,\u201d Palin said. \u201cI have great faith that President Trump is one who will fulfill campaign promises. He already has a track record of doing so well in these first months, I\u2019m just really proud to have been part of the constituency that wanted him in there and worked hard to get him in there. So, yeah, I\u2019m sure that President Trump is going to do the right thing and listen to all sides, of course, but understand, especially, that as a businessman, he\u2019s going to understand whether this makes sense in his vision of how to grow businesses and how to get government off our back and back on our side. How will we create a smaller, smarter government with a proposal like this that basically allows for the continuation of a growth of government? That\u2019s what any aspect of Obamacare or RINO-care does. So asking President Trump specifically about how running a business, not a Wall Street business, but mom-and-pop main street business, how does RINO-care help their business get to grow and drive and survive in this economy?\u201d LISTEN TO FORMER ALASKA GOV.

Cruz\u2019s broken pledge to support the will of the people tonight was one of those career-ending \u201cread my lips\u201d moments. I guarantee American voters took notice and felt more unsettling confirmation as to why we don\u2019t much like typical politicians because they campaign one way, but act out another way. That kind of political status quo has got to go because it got us into the mess we\u2019re in with America\u2019s bankrupt budgets and ramped up security threats. It\u2019s commonplace for politicians to disbelieve their word is their bond, as evidenced by Cruz breaking his promise to endorse his party\u2019s nominee, evidently thinking whilst on the convention stage, \u201cAt this point, what difference does it make?\u201d We\u2019ve been burned so horribly by that attitude that voters won\u2019t reward politicians pulling that \u201cwhat difference does it make\u201d stunt again.

      "author": "Ian Mason",
      "content": "  The line may seem familiar. It was a popular catch-phrase of a woman so-called \u201cprogressives\u201d have loved to mock and reveled in ridiculing since her explosion onto the national political scene in 2008: former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin. Imitation may\u00a0be the sincerest form of flattery, but when Governor Palin learned of Warren cribbing her line, she told Breitbart News, \u201cI don\u2019t know. Coming from liberals who urge women to claim victimization, \u2018Fight like a girl\u2019 just doesn\u2019t sound the same as when legit fighters for equality say it, mean it, live it, and will never give it up.\u201d Warren delivered the line electronically, standing beside the art installation \u201cFearless Girl,\u201d a copper figure of a small girl in a pouty pose. The little statue has caused a big stir on the left-wing since it was installed on Wall Street in front of the much more famous 1987 work \u201cCharging Bull\u201d by Italian artist Arturo Di Modica. While supporters of the \u201cFearless Girl\u201d see it as a symbol of feminist resistance to the greed of institutional finance, they might be surprised to learn the little statue was bankrolled by multinational finance giant State Street Global Advisors, the world\u2019s third largest asset manager with over $2.4 trillion \u2014 with a T\u2014 under its authority. State Street Global claims their motive in funding the addition was to promote its ongoing \u201cCampaign for Enhancing Gender Diversity in Corporate Leadership Roles.\u201d Professional feminist activists, politicians like Senator Warren, and their friends in the mainstream media were quick to seize on the diminutive statue as an important symbol of female empowerment. Di Modica, for his part, explained to Marketwatch how embarrassing he finds the whole episode. Di Modica spent $350,000 of his own money crafting \u201cCharging Bull\u201d and risked legal sanction by covertly dumping the statute in front of the New York Stock Exchange as a symbol of economic vitality and virility in the aftermath of 1987\u2019s devistating stock-market crash. He compared this corporate addition to his work to someone putting an AR-15 rifle in the hands of Michelangelo\u2019s David. \u201cThat is not a symbol! That\u2019s an advertising trick,\u201d he told Marketwatch. As for those who think it\u2019s a symbol of feminine achievement? \u201cThey made a mistake,\u201d Di Modica said. Senator Warren, however, seems not to think so. She even channels the \u201cFearless Girl\u2019s\u201d hands-on-hips stance on the cover of her new book on \u201cthe battle to save America\u2019s middle class.\u201d The multi-millionaire Massachusetts senator, however, is far less able to channel governor Palin\u2019s fiery appropriation of the age-old tease \u201cfight like a girl.\u201d In more\u00a0than a mere tweet, the self-described \u201chockey mom\u201d belted the phrase out in front of the Wisconsin State Capitol in Madison, Wisconsin after thousands of public sector union members threatened to shut the state down over measures designed to curb their outsized influence in Wisconsin politics. She spoke to ordinary Wisconsinites after their refusal to give in to leftist thuggery yielded a historic victory. Rather than fit in nicely with her party\u2019s latest fad, as Warren has done with feminists\u2019 favorite new statue, when Palin used \u201cfight like a girl\u201d in the \u201cTea Party Spring\u201d of 2011, she did so to call out her own party\u2019s establishment, drawing contrast between her and the populist-nationalist grassroots\u2019 tenacity and Washington Republicans\u2019 refusal to engage in political combat with the entrenched leftist interests. \u201cMaybe I should ask some of the Badger women\u2019s hockey team, those champions \u2026 \u201d she told the crowd, \u201cIf we should be suggesting to GOP leaders they need to learn how to fight like a girl!\u201d Breitbart News\u2019s own founder, the Pioneer of Populist Political Pugilism, the irreplaceable Andrew Breitbart, introduced Palin\u2019s 2011 speech, calling out big labor leader Richard Trumka of the AFL-CIO for siding with cartelized state employees over ordinary private sector taxpayers who make up traditional union membership and have deserted unions in droves. He appealed to the \u201csilent majority\u201d against these forces of division hawking race and class. He hit the left on its constant tone-policing patronization. And he called out the \u201ccommunity organizer in chief,\u201d setting the stage for Palin to deliver her stirring address.  In the lead-up to \u201cfight like a girl,\u201d Palin appealed to traditional union families and other groups commonly forgotten by the Republican establishment. She talked \u201creal solidarity.\u201d She spoke for a \u201ccommon good\u201d and fair solutions, and against special interests, left and right, teachers\u2019 union and Wall Street. Palin used \u201cfight like a girl\u201d to exhort, from everyone in the Wisconsinite populist grassroots, the stubborn determination to win so characteristic of the middle-American woman and so absent from the \u201cconservative\u201d class in Washington.  By contrast, Warren used the phrase as a cheap piggy-back on an even cheaper corporate ode to gender warfare. The example she cites of the phrase in her National Public Radio interview was even more telling. Warren describes seeing a little girl riding on her father\u2019s shoulders at an anti-Trump so-called \u201cwomen\u2019s march,\u201d complete with knit pink \u201cpussy hat.\u201d She held a sign emblazoned with that phrase, \u201cfight like a girl,\u201d once so subversive, so apt to unify, but now \u2014 in its obviously written-by-her-parents-and-put-in-her-hand guise \u2014 so easily dismissed, so calculated to divide, and so utterly unoriginal.",

      "subtitle": "Nebraska state Senator Deb Fischer rocketed out of nowhere to win the GOP senate primary on Tuesday, sending shockwaves across the political world from Nebraska to Washington, D.C.",
      "author": "Tony Lee",
      "content": "  The Republican establishment spent nearly $3 million to support state attorney general Jon Bruning. The Washington conservative establishment spent nearly $3 million to prop up their candidate, Don Stenberg, who never got traction despite all of his endorsements. But it took just 135 words from former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin to propel Fischer to the head of the pack and give her the momentum, buzz, and name identification to capitalize on some of the groundwork she had diligently laid. The message was clear: the conservative grassroots are fed up and candidates favored by both the Republican and the Washington conservative establishment are not safe. Fisher received 41 percent of the vote to Bruning\u2019s 36 percent and Stenberg\u2019s 19 percent. \u201cI never planned to run for the United States Senate, and most of you are the reason why I jumped in,\u201d Fischer said in her victory speech on Tuesday night. \u201cI wasn\u2019t happy with what was happening in Washington, and I don\u2019t think anyone is.\u201d Until Palin endorsed Fischer by writing her a note, nobody thought Fischer had a chance of entering the general election to become Nebraska\u2019s next Senator. \u201cAs recently as a week ago, Deb Fischer was dismissed by the establishment. Why? Because she is not part of the good old boys\u2019 permanent political class,\u201d Palin wrote in a Facebook note. \u201cThe message from the people of Nebraska is simple and powerful: America is looking for real change in Washington, and commonsense conservatives like Deb Fischer represent that change. \u201cI applaud Moms like Deb Fischer who are bold enough to step up and run on a conservative platform to restore America and protect our children\u2019s future,\u201d Palin continued. \u201cCongratulations to the people of Nebraska. As the Huskers\u2019 fight song goes: \u2018The eyes of the land, upon every hand, are looking at you. Fight on for victory!'\u201d Fischer was also helped when The Ending Spending Action Fund, an independent group focused on electing \u201ccommon-sense fiscal conservatives who understand the need to fundamentally reform our government,\u201d ran $200,000 worth of ads for Fischer last weekend. Brian Baker, president of the Ending Spending Action Fund, told Breitbart News, \u201cThe lesson here is simple: the people are in charge and they are sick of business as usual.\u201d And She-PAC, the new conservative group that was recently formed to help elect more women to Congress, seeded the ground for Fischer. ShePAC was her first national endorsement, and the group made two ads on behalf of Fischer and also promoted the ads with social networking buys that were smartly micro-targeted toward conservative women in Nebraska. Suzie Terrell, a co-chair of She-PAC, told Breitbart News\u00a0that her organization \u201clearned of the ranching mom from the Nebraska Sandhills\u201d when she was at 2 percent in the polls. Terrell noted that Fischer\u2019s \u201cpositive, issue-based grassroots campaign represented the exact type of conservative woman we helped to promote \u2013 and we are proud to have been her 1st national endorsement.\u201d \u201cAs the other candidates quarreled over trivial issues like who\u2019s following whose teenage daughter on twitter, Deb focused on voters and the issues and won,\u201d Terrell said. \u201cWe look forward to continuing to support Deb Fischer and the four other conservative women who will Stop Harry Reid in 2012.\u201d Fischer will now face Democrat Bob Kerrey, who won his party\u2019s primary, in the general election. Kerrey had been Nebraska\u2019s Senator before leaving the state to take on various ventures, such as being president of a liberal university in New York. Fischer alluded to this in her victory speech when she said, \u201cwe don\u2019t need the same type of person who supposedly is going to represent Nebraska.\u201d She said she would be a \u201cdifferent,\u201d \u201ctough\u201d and \u201ceffective\u201d Nebraskan who represents Nebraska in Congress. Last week, Fischer\u2019s campaign manager Aaron Trost told Breitbart News that because the could not match Bruning and Stenberg dollar for dollar, they laid a grassroots foundation, hoping they could surge in the final weeks of the campaign. Fischer was also helped by former Nebraska Gov. Kay Orr and Congressman Jeff Fortenberry. Her final surge began, though, when Palin single-handedly leveled the playing field with her endorsement and proved her endorsement effectively wipes out the financial advantages and the endorsements other candidates have. To be fair, had Fischer lost, the mainstream media and political establishment would have spun it as a defeat for Palin. And this is why a Fischer victory should be noted as more proof that Palin \u2014 and the Tea Party \u2014 have not faded, and their influence is only growing. \u201cYou can\u2019t quit yet,\u201d Fischer told the audience at her victory party, noting that the general election starts on Wednesday. Like Fischer, Palin and the Tea Party are just getting started.  ",

      "author": "Ken Klukowski",
      "content": " \u201cThis case is ultimately about the First Amendment, but the subject matter implicated in this appeal is far less dramatic: rules of procedure and pleading standards,\u201d began the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Judge Jed Rakoff of the Southern District of New York, appointed by Bill Clinton, had dismissed Palin\u2019s complaint for failing to state a plausible claim. A three-judge panel of the Second Circuit disagreed, reinstating the lawsuit. The lawsuit arose in the aftermath of depraved Tucson shooter Jared Loughner\u2019s murderous rampage in Tucson in 2011 \u2013 killing six people, including a federal judge, John Roll \u2013 and seriously wounding Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-AZ). Palin\u2019s political committee, SarahPAC, had run ads surrounding Congress\u2019s voting on the Affordable Care Act (aka, \u201cObamacare\u201d), with \u201ca map that superimposed the image of a crosshairs target over certain Democratic congressional districts.\u201d \u201cIn the wake of the Loughner shooting, some speculated that the shooting was connected to the crosshairs map,\u201d the Second Circuit continued. \u201cNo evidence ever emerged to establish the link,\u201d Judge John Walker wrote for the panel. \u201cIn fact, the criminal investigation of Loughner indicated that his animosity toward Representative Giffords had arisen before SarahPAC published the map.\u201d When left-wing fanatic James Hodgkinson opened fire in 2017 in an effort to assassinate Republican congressmen, severely wounding conservative Steve Scalise (R-LA), the New York Times\u00a0ran an editorial citing SarahPAC\u2019s ad from 2011, commented that the \u201clink to political incitement was clear\u201d to the Loughner shooting, then went on to discuss Hodgkinson\u2019s act of domestic terrorism. \u201cThe Times\u00a0faced an immediate backlash for publishing the editorial,\u201d Walker continued, noting that the paper later published a correction which admitted that in fact, \u201cno such link was established.\u201d Palin sued the Times\u00a0for defamation in federal court 12 days after the editorial ran, and the Times\u00a0filed a motion to dismiss the case. The case then \u201ctook an unusual procedural turn,\u201d the New York City-based appeals court observed, when the judge \u201cheld an evidentiary hearing on the motion to dismiss.\u201d Under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a district court must generally accept the facts alleged by a plaintiff as true, and cannot dismiss a case for failing to make a claim unless, even if all the claimed facts are true, the law would still be on the side of the defendant. \u201cOn August 29, 2017, the district court, relying on evidence adduced at the hearing, granted the Times\u2019 motion to dismiss,\u201d the panel recounted. The appellate court noted that a district court cannot consider evidence outside a plaintiff\u2019s complaint in a motion to dismiss, and instead must convert that motion to one for summary judgment if the judge wants to decide the case at that stage. However, once a court moves into summary-judgment territory, both sides must have the opportunity to present their evidence and argument. \u201cEven if the plaintiff had been given notice and the court had explicitly converted the motion to one for summary judgment,\u201d the Second Circuit reasoned, \u201cwe would still have to vacate because the district court\u2019s opinion relied on credibility determinations not permissible at any stage before trial.\u201d The Second Circuit concluded that Palin stated a plausible claim of defamation, and must now be given an opportunity to present evidence to make her case. The panel in question was comprised of two Republican-appointed judges and one judge appointed by Barack Obama. The decision in Palin\u2019s favor was unanimous. \u201cThis is \u2013 and always has been \u2013 a case about media accountability,\u201d Palin\u2019s lawyer Libby Locke told Breitbart News. \u201cWe are pleased with the court\u2019s decision, and look forward to starting discovery and ultimately proceeding to trial.\u201d The case is Palin v. New York Times Co., No. 17-3801-cv in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, and No. 17-cv-4853 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.

      "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
      "content": " Breitbart News has independently confirmed an earlier report in\u00a0People magazine, which reported that Palin was not sent an invitation and was told through intermediaries to stay away from the ceremony. McCain fundraiser\u00a0Carla Eudy confirmed to\u00a0People that Palin had not been invited \u2014 possibly,\u00a0People speculated, at the behest of the McCain family. The news comes on the tenth anniversary of the date in 2008 when Palin was announced as McCain\u2019s pick for vice president. Palin now joins President Donald Trump on the list of those barred from the funeral. But unlike Trump, Palin never feuded with McCain and never criticized him. When news broke on Saturday of McCain\u2019s passing, Palin said, \u201cToday we lost an American original. Sen. John McCain was a maverick and a fighter, never afraid to stand for his beliefs. John never took the easy path in life \u2014 and through sacrifice and suffering he inspired others to serve something greater than self. \u201cJohn McCain was my friend. I will remember the good times. My family and I send prayers for Cindy and the McCain family.\u201d Last year, when McCain was reported to have\u00a0said that he regretted choosing Palin instead of Sen. Joe Lieberman (I-CT), Palin described the news as a \u201cgut punch\u201d but refused to blame McCain personally, telling the UK\u00a0Daily Mail that she blamed his \u201cghostwriters\u201d for such reports. When McCain selected Palin as his running mate, the two had both built reputations as corruption-busting \u201cmaverick\u201d leaders who were not afraid to buck their own parties. After the 2008 election, they moved in separate political directions. Palin became an inspirational figure for the Tea Party and for grassroots conservatives in general. McCain campaigned as a conservative border hawk in his 2010 re-election race but became a harsh critic of the Tea Party, calling Sens. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Rand Paul (R-KY) \u201cwacko birds.\u201d Many in the Beltway blamed Palin for McCain\u2019s loss in 2008 \u2014 even though Barack Obama had benefited from a sudden financial crisis and a biased press corps. That view seemed to have seeped into McCain\u2019s own thinking. Still, Palin never took offense and always honored McCain. Even after being excluded from the funeral, she declined to criticize him. People quoted a source close to the Palin family: \u201c[O]ut of respect for Sen. McCain and his family we have nothing to add at this point. The Palin family will always cherish their friendship with the McCains and hold those memories dear.\u201d McCain will be laid to rest on Sunday in Annapolis, following several days of memorial events and ceremonies.

Palin was incredulous at Behar\u2019s mock outrage over being called a bitch especially considering all the names she has called others. \u201cBuckle up,\u201d Palin wrote on her Facebook page. \u201cSave the crocodile tears @joyvbehar \u2013 if you can dish it out you sure as heck better be ready to take it in.\u201d Palin went on saying, \u201cYou sat idly by, downright giddy, as guests on YOUR show called my daughter a hooker? You\u2019ve said worse about me (and other women), but I\u2019ve got other things to do than spend precious time googling it all.\u201d \u201cJoyless B \u2013 suck it up, cupcake,\u201d Palin jabbed before adding a link to a report citing the time her daughter was called a \u201chooker\u201d on The View.  Palin\u2019s comments were sparked by a Friday interview where Rock made to criticize political correctness and brought Behar into the conversation. On Live TV, Rock told Fox & Friends host Steve Doocy, \u201cGod forbid you say something a little bit wrong you\u2019re racist, homophobic, Islamophobic\u2026 people need to calm down, a get a little less politically correct, and, I would say love everybody. Except I\u2019d say screw that Joy Behar bitch, everybody but that.\u201d Rock later apologized for using the curse word but did not apologize for the sentiment he was trying to relay to viewers. \u201cBehar has been an outspoken critic of President Donald Trump, and when myself, Sarah Palin and Ted Nugent visited the White House last year, Behar called it \u2018the saddest day in the history of the White House since the British burned it to the ground in 1814,'\u201d Rock said in a statement released later on Friday. \u201cToday I said \u2018Screw that Joy Behar b\u2014h.\u2019 Mess with the bull, you get the horns. End of story. I apologized for cursing on live TV, I will not for my sentiment nor do I expect an apology from her or anyone else who has choice words for me or doesn\u2019t like me. God Bless America.\u201d Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston.",

      "content": " Am I describing the 45th President\u2019s effort to buy Greenland from Denmark? Nope, I\u2019m describing the\u00a017th\u00a0President\u2019s successful effort to buy Alaska from Russia in 1867. It was one of the best bargains America ever struck. If President Trump can pull off another deal like that, I say God bless him! Greenland\u2019s vast arctic expanse\u2014which, at over 800,000 square miles, is more than a quarter the size of the U.S. Lower 48\u2014is surely another Alaska in terms of untapped wealth. The media would do well to chill with mocking President Trump and instead learn some U.S. history. Our country\u2019s desire to purchase Greenland predates the purchase of Alaska. Back in 1867, the effort to buy Alaska was the brainchild of then-Secretary of State William Seward, who had originally been appointed to the post by Abraham Lincoln. Under President Lincoln, Seward steered America\u2019s diplomacy during the Civil War, and that experience gave him a deep appreciation of the importance of territory as a source of both wealth and security.\u00a0 He understood that the possession of a given piece of land can be used as a forward military base for the United States, and therefore not as launching pad for a potential foe. Those were the days, after all, when the great powers of the era\u2014Britain, France, Russia, and soon Germany and Japan\u2014were sending their gunboats around the world looking to snap up colonies.\u00a0 So as a simple matter of self-defense, the United States had little choice but to muscle up geographically. With that in mind, Seward\u2019s first idea was to purchase \u2026\u00a0Greenland. That\u2019s right, he pursued Greenland\u00a0first. But the Danes wouldn\u2019t sell. Seward also wanted to buy islands in the Caribbean from, again, Denmark. And once again, the Danes wouldn\u2019t sell, although in that instance the sale finally did go through in 1917, and that\u2019s how Uncle Sam came to own the U.S. Virgin Islands. In the meantime, Seward kept searching. Seeking the most strategic location and vast natural resources, he cast his eye on the beautiful territory that would become our Last Frontier, Alaska. The Russians had been here\u2014where I stand today\u2014for centuries, easily hopping across the 50-mile-wide Bering Strait from Siberia to \u201cRussian America.\u201d (And,\u00a0yes, that body of water is so narrow you really can stand in Alaska and actually see Russia. So Tina Fey can suck it.) The Russians weren\u2019t smart enough to do much with Alaska beyond over-whaling and over-hunting.\u00a0 So when Seward offered the Tsar two-cents an acre\u2014$7.2 million for the whole kit and caboodle\u2014the art of this deal created a bigger, better, safer, and richer America. Of course, then as now, the critics did what they always do\u2014huddle up, sit on their heinies, and\u00a0criticize.\u00a0 The Alaska purchase was lampooned as \u201cSeward\u2019s Folly\u201d and \u201cSeward\u2019s Ice Box.\u201d But Alaska wasn\u2019t an \u201cice box\u201d\u2014it was an absolute gold mine \u2026\u00a0literally. The critics stopped laughing in 1896 when gold was discovered in the Yukon, and soon the Klondike Gold Rush established Alaska as a major magnet. The rich veins even attracted a young German immigrant named Frederick Trump\u2014President Trump\u2019s grandfather\u2014who struck it rich up north and later settled in New York City. Perhaps the Trumps have\u00a0always had their eye on valuable \u201cglacierfront\u201d real estate. Today, Alaska is home to more than 700,000 hardy Americans, generating an annual economic output of around $50 billion. \u00a0Seward\u2019s \u201cfolly\u201d really is Seward\u2019s windfall. Now let\u2019s go back to the place Seward eyed first. Greenland is economically valuable because of its immense natural resources. Aside from\u00a0yuge\u00a0oil and gas development possibilities and enormously rich fisheries, Greenland has iron ore, lead, zinc, gold, and uranium. But perhaps most importantly, the arctic region, and Greenland in particular, is full of rare earth elements, a crucial material necessary for manufacturing just about everything from computer chips to fiber optics to missiles to tanks and you name it. We need rare earth elements to sustain our manufacturing sector and equip our military. And, as shocking as it is to say this, our country is currently dangerously dependent on China to supply our rare earth metals. Since when is it a good idea to be totally dependent on your strategic enemy for an essential resource? China knows they have us over a barrel on this. In fact, as Breitbart\u2019s John Carney reported last May, Beijing has threatened to \u201cweaponize\u201d our dependence on their rare earths as leverage against us in their trade fight. So, is it any wonder that China also has eyes on Greenland? In fact, China already has a large commercial presence there, as they\u2019ve been scooping up rare earth mining rights. No doubt they would love to get control over\u00a0all\u00a0of its resources. They are quite open about their\u00a0plans to make Greenland a key part of what they call their \u201cPolar Silk Road.\u201d They\u2019re eagerly offering to build international airports, which, of course, they will control. China understands that Greenland is strategically\u00a0vital. Up there at the top of the world, it has a commanding position on the Arctic Ocean, not far from Russia. \u00a0I, and others, predict the Arctic Ocean will become a\u00a0key\u00a0international seaway, with an incalculable advantage going to Greenland. It\u2019s precisely because of Greenland\u2019s strategic location that we put our northernmost military base there. The Thule Air Force base is crucial to our nation\u2019s missile defense system. Again, is it any wonder why China is so eager to get a foothold in Greenland? As William Seward knew when he purchased Alaska from the Russians, controlling a strategic location allows the United States to establish a forward base and prevent our enemies from doing the same. So, as a matter of national security as well as economic prosperity, it makes sense for the United States to have a strong footprint in Greenland. So, go for it, Mr. President. America can help Make Greenland Great Again! And a Trump Tower up there could be very cool. Sarah Palin is the former governor of Alaska and the 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee.",

      "content": " Without borders, there is no nation. Obama knows this.\u00a0Opening our borders to a flood of illegal immigrants is deliberate.\u00a0This is his fundamental transformation of America. It\u2019s the only promise he has kept. Discrediting the price paid for America\u2019s exceptionalism over our history, he\u2019s given false hope and taxpayer\u2019s change to millions of foreign nationals who want to sneak into our country illegally. Because of Obama\u2019s purposeful dereliction of duty an untold number of illegal immigrants will kick off their shoes and come on in, competing against Americans for our jobs and limited public services. There is no end in sight as our president prioritizes parties over doing the job he was hired by voters to do. Securing our borders is obviously fundamental here; it goes without saying that it is\u00a0his job. The federal government is trillions of dollars in debt; many cities are on the verge of insolvency; our overrun healthcare system, police forces, social services, schools, and our unsustainably generous welfare-state programs are stretched to the max. We average Americans know that. So why has this issue been allowed to be turned upside down with our \u201cleader\u201d creating such unsafe conditions while at the same time obstructing any economic recovery by creating more dependents than he allows producers? His friendly wealthy bipartisan elite, who want cheap foreign labor and can afford for themselves the best \u201cborder security\u201d money can buy in their own exclusive communities, do not care that Obama tapped us out. Have faith that average American workers \u2013 native-born and wonderful legal immigrants of all races, backgrounds, and political parties \u2013\u00a0do care\u00a0because we\u2019re the ones getting screwed as we\u2019re forced to follow all our government\u2019s rules while others are not required to do so. Many now feel like strangers in their own land. It\u2019s the American worker who is forced to deal with Obama\u2019s latest crisis with our hard-earned tax dollars while middle class wages decrease, sustainable jobs get more scarce, and communities become unrecognizable and bankrupted due to Obama\u2019s flood of illegal immigration. Who\u2019s looking out for the American workers? Who has their backs? Who fights for them? We should. President Obama\u2019s rewarding of lawlessness, including his own, is the foundational problem here. It\u2019s not going to get better, and in fact irreparable harm can be done in this lame-duck term as he continues to make up his own laws as he goes along, and, mark my words, will next meddle in the U.S. Court System with appointments that will forever change the basic interpretation of our Constitution\u2019s role in protecting our rights. It\u2019s time to impeach; and on behalf of American workers and legal immigrants of all backgrounds, we should vehemently oppose any politician on the left or right who would hesitate in voting for articles of impeachment. The many impeachable offenses of Barack Obama can no longer be ignored. If after all this he\u2019s not impeachable, then no one is.",
