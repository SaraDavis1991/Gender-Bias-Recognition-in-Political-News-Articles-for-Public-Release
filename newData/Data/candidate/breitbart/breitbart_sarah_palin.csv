Critics hate the idea and mock it as absurd and wasteful. But the President makes the deal, and the purchase proves to be one of the most brilliant geopolitical deals in history—a huge boon to American strength and prosperity.","","22 Aug 2019","It’s precisely because of Greenland’s strategic location that we put our northernmost military base there. The Thule Air Force base is crucial to our nation’s missile defense system. Again, is it any wonder why China is so eager to get a foothold in Greenland? As William Seward knew when he purchased Alaska from the Russians, controlling a strategic location allows the United States to establish a forward base and prevent our enemies from doing the same."

I’ve been fighting that since I was 18 years old and first registered to vote against the Republican Party in my own state, bless their hearts, running against them when they were not believing in smaller, smarter government and they weren’t exercising Reaganomics. Running against them, winning, and it’s helpful to see it wasn’t just little old Wasilla, Alaska, that had those types of battles. Those battles have been going on all across this country, and finally enough people stood up and said ‘enough is enough’ and that’s the movement. It’s all good, it’s all positive.

Then they had me read about this four-year-old child in Israel, who when a terrorist entered his classroom, somehow he grabbed the terrorist’s gun and held the terrorist at bay.

Greenland’s vast arctic expanse—which, at over 800,000 square miles, is more than a quarter the size of the U.S. Lower 48—is surely another Alaska in terms of untapped wealth. The media would do well to chill with mocking President Trump and instead learn some U.S. history. Our country’s desire to purchase Greenland predates the purchase of Alaska."
