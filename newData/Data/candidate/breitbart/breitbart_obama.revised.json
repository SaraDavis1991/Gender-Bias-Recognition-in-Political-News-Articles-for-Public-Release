      "content": "Sunday on New York AM 970 radio\u2019s \u201cThe Cats Roundtable,\u201d former House Speaker Newt Gingrich argued that it is not \u201cconceivable\u201d for neither former President Barack Obama nor his Attorney General Loretta Lynch to not know the FBI was spying on the Donald Trump campaign. Gingrich told host John Catsimatidis after the recent release of the Department of Justice\u2019s inspector general report that it is \u201cclear\u201d the fix was in and those involved will not be prosecuted. \u201cWith everything we\u2019re learning from the inspector general\u2018s report, how is it conceivable that the attorney general and the president didn\u2019t know about it?\u201d asked Gingrich. \u201cSo, part 1 is to go back and look at 2015, 2016, and ask, given what a hands-on and dynamic president that Barack Obama was, do you really believe all these things happened and the attorney general and the president didn\u2019t know it?\u201d He continued, \u201cPart 2 \u2026 there\u2019s a story that the woman who tried to bribe her son into a university, that she and her husband got caught, that they\u2019re now facing 40 years in jail. Now, how can we not prosecute Comey? How can we not prosecute McCabe? How can we say that they\u2019ve done all the terrible things that the inspector general said they did, but they\u2019re somehow above the law? People are not going to have any faith in the system until people who are guilty are prosecuted and are treated like everybody else. People are not going to have any faith in the system. \u2026 It\u2019s clear that no matter how bad they were, the fix is in and they\u2019re not going to be prosecuted.\u201d Follow Trent Baker on Twitter\u00a0@MagnifiTrent",

      "subtitle": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) belittled working Americans during a\u00a0campaign stop in Hampton Falls, New Hampshire, Monday, suggesting that those who worked hard for their wealth or success did not make it happen on their own.",
      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": "Warren campaigned in the Granite State on Labor Day, delivering a classic stump speech at a backyard event. She repeated typical portions of her life story to enthusiastic supporters, decried the influence of the Koch brothers in politics, and vowed to weed out corruption in Washington. Warren also talked about her plan to implement a monstrous \u201cwealth tax\u201d and belittled Americans who have worked hard to enjoy the fruits of their success, echoing former President Barack Obama\u2019s infamous \u201cyou didn\u2019t build that\u201d remarks circa 2012. \u201cWe need more power in the hands of workers. We need to make it easier to join a union and give the union smart power when they negotiate. Unions built America\u2019s middle class and they will rebuild America\u2019s middle class,\u201d Warren said, echoing tweets she penned earlier in the day. \u201cIt is time for a wealth tax in America,\u201d she continued before seemingly dismissing the hard work of individuals who enjoy the fruits of their labor. \u201cI\u2019m not proposing a wealth tax because I\u2019m cranky. Some of these guys say, \u2018I worked hard. I had a great idea. I worked late\u2019\u2013 oh yeah, unlike anybody else,\u201d she sarcastically stated. \u201cBut \u2018I worked late or\u00a0inherited wealth, and so this is mine.'\u201d She continued: And the answer is yeah, you did. Good for you. You did have a great idea and you did work hard. No one is angry about that, but here\u2019s the deal. You built a great fortune here in America. I guarantee you built it at least in part using workers all of us help pay to educate. Yeah. You built it at least in part, getting your goods to market on roads and bridges all of us helped pay to build. Yep. You built it at least in part, protected by police and firefighters all of us help pay their salaries. And we\u2019re are glad to do it. These are the investments we make as Americans. Warren\u2019s remarks were eerily\u00a0reminiscent of the sentiment pushed by Obama in 2012. He told a group at a campaign event in Roanoke, Virginia, that successful Americans \u201cdidn\u2019t get there\u201d on their own. Obama\u00a0said (emphasis added): There are a lot of wealthy, successful Americans who agree with me \u2014 because they want to give something back. They know they didn\u2019t \u2014 look, if you\u2019ve been successful, you didn\u2019t get there on your own. You didn\u2019t get there on your own. I\u2019m always struck by people who think, well, it must be because I was just so smart. There are a lot of smart people out there. It must be because I worked harder than everybody else. Let me tell you something \u2014 there are a whole bunch of hardworking people out there. If you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help. There was a great teacher somewhere in your life. Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system that we have that allowed you to thrive. Somebody invested in roads and bridges. If you\u2019ve got a business \u2014 you didn\u2019t build that. Somebody else made that happen. The Internet didn\u2019t get invented on its own. Government research created the Internet so that all the companies could make money off the Internet.  Warren has championed herself as one of the most pro-worker, pro-union Democrats in the crowded presidential field, but it remains unclear why she would espouse such a dismissive message toward hard-working Americans, particularly on Labor Day.",

      "subtitle": "A key revelation in the report released last week by the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general raises questions about the roles played by Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Susan Rice and other senior members of the Obama administration in disgraced former FBI Director James Comey\u2019s infamous classified briefing to then President-elect Donald Trump about \u201csalacious\u201d material inside the anti-Trump dossier.",
      "author": "Aaron Klein",
      "content": "As Breitbart News reported, the IG report relates that prior to the briefing, FBI members on Comey\u2019s team discussed the need to memorialize the exchanges between Comey and Trump during the private January 6, 2017 briefing in Trump Tower just in case Trump made statements relevant to the agency\u2019s controversial Russia probe. In other words, they plotted to stealthily use statements Trump said to Comey in a private briefing to inform their Russia collusion investigation. The IG further relates that Comey went on to do just that. He had a laptop waiting for him in the car, where he immediately began memorializing his private talk with Trump. He also immediately provided a \u201cquick download\u201d of the Trump briefing to members of \u201cCrossfire Hurricane\u201d \u2013 the FBI\u2019s compartmentalized Russia collusion team \u2014 via a secured video conference. The revelation that Comey immediately fed the details of his private meeting with Trump to the FBI team investigation unsubstantiated Russia collusion raises questions about what Obama, Biden, Rice and other Obama-era officials knew about the intent to use the planned briefing to fuel the questionable Russia investigation and surreptitiously pass the contents of the private talk to the FBI. In his book, A Higher Loyalty, Comey writes that he told Obama, Biden and Rice about his plans to have the private briefing with Trump.\u00a0 He did this on January 5, 2017 in a White House briefing with Obama one day before he met Trump and underhandedly sent the details of their one-on-one to the FBI\u2019s \u201cCrossfire Hurricane\u201d team handling the Russia collusion claims. Comey writes: After an extended discussion on the intelligence assessment, the president asked what the plan was for further briefings. Director Clapper explained that we were to meet the Gang of Eight the next morning\u2014the top officials in Congress, both Democrats and Republicans, briefed on intelligence matters\u2014and then we would go immediately to New York City to brief the president-elect and his senior team. Clapper explained to Obama that there was an unusual matter that needed to be brought to Mr. Trump\u2019s attention: additional material\u2014what would become commonly called \u201cthe Steele dossier\u201d\u2014that contained a variety of allegations about Trump. Comey writes that Obama specifically asked about the details of the \u201cplan\u201d to brief Trump: Obama did not appear to have any reaction to any of this\u2014at least none he would share with us. In a level voice, he asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the plan for that briefing?\u201d With just the briefest of sidelong glances at me, Clapper took a breath, then said, \u201cWe have decided that Director Comey will meet alone with the president-elect to brief him on this material following the completion of the full ICA briefing.\u201d The president did not say a word. Instead he turned his head to his left and looked directly at me. He raised and lowered both of his eyebrows with emphasis, and then looked away. I suppose you can read whatever you want into a wordless expression, but to my mind his Groucho Marx eyebrow raise was both subtle humor and an expression of concern. It was almost as if he were saying, \u201cGood luck with that.\u201d I began to feel a lump in my stomach\u2026 That same day, Comey writes, he received a call from Obama\u2019s Homeland Security Secretary, Jeh Johnson, further inquiring about the plan to brief Trump. Johnson was present at Comey\u2019s White House meeting with Obama earlier in the day. The ex-FBI chief relates: Later that day, I received a call from Jeh Johnson, the secretary of Homeland Security, who had been a friend since we were federal prosecutors together in Manhattan in the 1980s. He had been in the Oval Office that morning for the briefing.\u00a0 I have no idea whether he was calling me at President Obama\u2019s suggestion, or if the two even spoke about the matter, but he gave voice to how I viewed the Oval Office eyebrow raise. \u201cJim, I\u2019m worried about this plan for you to privately brief the president-elect,\u201d he said. \u201cMe, too,\u201d I replied. \u201cHave you ever met Donald Trump?\u201d he asked. \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cJim, please be careful. Be very careful. This may not go well.\u201d I thanked Jeh for the concern and the call. In their book, Russian Roulette: The Inside Story of Putin\u2019s War on America and the Election of Donald Trump, reporters Michael Isikoff and David Corn write about the briefing with Obama one day before Comey met with Trump. They document: On Thursday, January 5, 2017, the day before its public release, the intelligence chiefs briefed Obama and his senior staff. White House officials were taken aback. It was \u201cthe first time all the pieces came together for us,\u201d one senior official said. \u201cIt seemed a much grander conspiracy than it was during the election. This was an intelligence failure and a failure of the imagination.\u201d And when Biden was briefed about intelligence reports on the connections between various players in the Trump orbit and the Kremlin, he had a visceral reaction. \u201cIf this is true,\u201d he exclaimed, \u201cit\u2019s treason.\u201d A few days earlier, Rice had encouraged Clapper during the daily intelligence briefing to tell Obama about the \u201cgolden showers\u201d allegation. Obama turned to Rice and said, \u201cWhy am I hearing this?\u201d He was incredulous. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d he asked. Rice said the intelligence community had no idea if this story was true but that Obama needed to be aware the allegation was circulating. \u201cYou don\u2019t really expect to hear the term \u2018golden showers\u2019 in the President Daily Brief,\u201d a participant in this meeting later said, \u201cor that the guy who is going to become president may be a Manchurian candidate. Biden, Rice Involved in Early Stages of Russia Probe Biden and Rice were reportedly involved in the Russia probe since the early inception of the investigation.\u00a0Attorney General William Barr\u00a0 made a series of public comments that the U.S. administration\u2019s early handling of the Russia investigation may itself raise questions. He noted that it was first handled at a \u201cvery senior level\u201d and then by a \u201csmall group.\u201d Barr recently appointed a U.S. attorney to investigate the origins of the Russia collusion claims. Breitbart News previously reported that Biden was reportedly one of the few Obama administration officials who participated in secretive meetings during the early stages of the Obama-era intelligence community\u2019s initial operations regarding suspected Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign. Separately, Isikoff and Corn wrote in their book that Colin Kahl, who served as Biden\u2019s national security adviser, participated in highly compartmentalized early principals\u2019 meetings that took place at the White House to discuss the\u00a0 early stages of the Russia investigation. Biden was also documented as being present in the Oval Office for a conversation about the Russia probe between Obama, Comey, Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates and other senior officials, including Rice. In an action characterized as \u201codd\u201d last year by then-Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, Rice memorialized the confab in an email to herself describing Obama as starting \u201cthe conversation by stressing his continued commitment to ensuring that every aspect of this issue is handled by the Intelligence and law enforcement communities \u2018by the book.\u2019\u201d Grassley, in a letter to Rice, commented: \u201cIt strikes us as odd that, among your activities in the final moments on the final day of the Obama administration, you would feel the need to send yourself such an unusual email purporting to document a conversation involving President Obama and his interactions with the FBI regarding the Trump/Russia investigation.\u201d Grassley noted the unusual timing of the email sent by Rice to herself more than two weeks after the January 5, 2017 White House meeting on the Russia investigation, but mere hours before she vacated the White House for the incoming Trump administration. The email, Grassley documented, was sent by Rice to herself on Trump\u2019s inauguration day of January 20, 2017. Grassley wrote that \u201cdespite your claim that President Obama repeatedly told Mr. Comey to proceed \u2018by the book,\u2019 substantial questions have arisen about whether officials at the FBI, as well as at the Justice Department and the State Department, actually did proceed \u2018by the book.\u2019\u201d An attorney for Rice responded to Grassley\u2019s letter saying Rice wrote the email to herself with the goal of \u201cmemorializ[ing] an important national security discussion,\u201d since \u201cPresident Obama and his national security team were justifiably concerned about potential risks to the Nation\u2019s security from sharing highly classified information about Russia with certain members of the Trump transition team, particularly Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn.\u201d The attorney denied that the Steele dossier, financed by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign, was discussed in the Oval Office meeting. Regarding the time stamp on the email, the attorney said that noon was not accurate and that the email was sent in the morning \u201csince Ambassador Rice departed the White House shortly before noon on January 20.\u201d Still, Rice waited two weeks after the meeting to memorialize the conversation and sent the memo as one of her final acts in the White House on the last day. The attorney said that Rice waited until the last minute \u201cbecause that was the first opportunity she had to do so, given the particularly intense responsibilities of the National Security Advisor during the remaining days of the Administration and transition.\u201d Comey Passed Private Conversation with Trump to FBI Team Investigating Russia Hoax Meanwhile, addressing the revelation in the IG report that Comey immediately fed the details of his private briefing with Trump to the FBI\u2019s \u201cCrossfire Hurricane,\u201d Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif) charged on Fox News that what Comey was \u201creally doing\u201d was \u201cinterrogating the president and then using that information and feeding it right back into the \u2018Crossfire Hurricane\u2019 team at a time when \u2026 [Neither] Congress nor the president-elect knew he was under investigation.\u201d Until now, Comey and other former Obama administration officials presented the unusual briefing as a courtesy to Trump to warn him about the news media possibly publically releasing embarrassing claims about the newly elected president. \u00a0Questions have been raised on the need to include the dossier\u2019s wild and unsubstantiated charges in the classified briefings. It is not the usual job of the intelligence community to warn politicians about possible pending negative publicity. The IG report, based on interviews with Comey and other FBI \u201cwitnesses\u201d, documents that prior to Comey\u2019s briefing the FBI discussed utilizing Comey\u2019s classified private talk with Trump to inform the controversial Russia collusion probe. The report relates: Witnesses interviewed by the OIG also said that they discussed Trump\u2019s potential responses to being told about the \u201csalacious\u201d information, including that Trump might make statements about, or provide information of value to, the pending Russian interference investigation. That FBI counterintelligence investigation, known as \u201cCrossfire Hurricane,\u201d concerned whether individuals associated with the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election were coordinating with, or had been unwittingly co-opted by, the Russian government. Multiple FBI witnesses recalled agreeing ahead of time that Comey should memorialize his meeting with Trump immediately after it occurred. Comey told the OIG that, in his view, it was important for FBI executive managers to be \u201cable to share in [Comey\u2019s] recall of the\u2026salient details of those conversations.\u201d Another reason Comey provided for taking notes on his conversation with Trump was to \u201ccapture his\u2026contemporaneous recollection\u201d because there were \u201cmillions of ways that [the FBI] could get follow-up questions, or criticism\u2026and [Comey] wanted to recollect exactly, from his perspective, how it had taken place.\u201d Right after his briefing with Trump, Comey immediately updated the FBI team probing Russia collusion claims about his private talk with the incoming president, the IG documented: Comey told the OIG he began writing Memo 1 immediately following his meeting with Trump on January 6, 2017. Comey said he had a secure FBI laptop waiting for him in his FBI vehicle and that when he got into the vehicle, he was handed the laptop and \u201cbegan typing [Memo 1] as the vehicle moved.\u201d He said he continued working on Memo 1 until he arrived at the FBI\u2019s New York field office, where Comey gave a \u201cquick download\u201d of his conversation with President-elect Trump to Rybicki, McCabe, Baker, and supervisors of the FBI\u2019s Crossfire Hurricane investigative team via secure video teleconference (SVTC). Comey said he probably told the SVTC participants that he would send them his \u201cdetailed notes\u201d of the interaction. James Rybicki was Comey\u2019s chief of staff; Andrew McCabe was FBI deputy director; and James Baker was FBI counsel. A footnote in the report further relates: On January 7, 2017, Comey wrote a classified email to the other Intelligence Community Directors to let them know that his \u201cfollow-up session with [the President-elect] went well\u201d and provided them a brief summary of the conversation that was less detailed than Memo 1). Besides failing to inform Trump that he would be taking notes on his private briefing or that he would pass those notes to the FBI team investigating the Russia claims, Comey also used the briefing to assure Trump that he was not a subject of the FBI probe. In previous testimony, Comey admitted that he did not inform the incoming president about who financed the dossier.\u00a0 He also admitted in testimony that he was aware at the time that the dossier authored by former British spy Christopher Steele was financed by Democrats who opposed Trump.\u00a0 The dossier was paid for by Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign and the Democratic National Committee. Comey also previously stated that he pushed back against a request from Trump to possibly investigate the origins of \u201csalacious material\u201d \u2013 meaning the dossier \u2014 that the agency possessed in the course of its investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign.\u00a0 This even though Comey admitted to knowing it was financed by Trump\u2019s political opponents. Comey\u2019s classified briefing was subsequently leaked to the news media, with CNN on January 10, 2017 breaking the story that the contents of the dossier were presented during classified briefings one week earlier to Trump and then-President Barack Obama. Prior to CNN\u2019s report leaking the briefings, which was picked up by news agencies worldwide, the contents of the dossier had been circulating among news media outlets, but the sensational claims were largely considered too risky to publish. Comey\u2019s briefing seems to have provided the news media with the hook to publish a story on the controversial dossier containing the infamous \u201cRussian prostitute\u201d claims as well as unsubstantiated charges of collusion between Russia and members of Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign. Just after CNN\u2019s January 10 report on the classified briefings about the dossier, BuzzFeed infamously\u00a0published\u00a0the dossier\u2019s full unverified contents. The\u00a0New York Times\u00a0used CNN\u2019s story to report some contents of the dossier the same day as CNN\u2019s January 10 report on the briefings.

      "content": "Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi made the offer ahead of a looming deadline set by Iran to further reduce its commitments under the nuclear accord. The agreement \u2014 known formally as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) \u2014 has been in abeyance since the United States withdrew\u00a0in May last year\u00a0as part of a campaign promise kept by U.S. President Donald Trump. It was the product of protracted negotiations led by then-Secretary of State John Kerry and was widely viewed as the Obama administration\u2019s signature foreign policy achievement. By the terms of the agreement, Iran would\u00a0accept\u00a0restrictions to and inspections of its nuclear program designed to prevent them from developing a nuclear weapon in exchange for the cessation of the western sanctions crippling their economy. The accord is still backed by Britain, France and Germany. France has since been trying to convince the U.S. to offer Iran some sort of relief from sanctions it has reimposed on the Islamic republic since its pullout. \u201cIran\u2026 will return to full implementation of the JCPOA only if it is able to sell its oil and to fully benefit from the income from these sales,\u201d said Araghchi. \u201cThe French proposal goes in that direction,\u201d he was quoted as saying by state news agency IRNA. Araghchi, speaking days after leading an economic delegation to France, ruled out any renegotiation of the JCPOA, but said Iran was open to talks on how to implement it better in return for U.S. dollars. \u201cReturning to full implementation of the JCPOA is subject to receiving $15 billion over a period of four months, otherwise the process of Iran reducing its commitments will continue,\u201d he said. But Araghchi cast doubt on the likelihood of an agreement being reached before the deadline set by Iran. \u201cI don\u2019t think the European countries will be able to take an effective step before Friday,\u201d he said.

      "subtitle": "NEW YORK \u2014 Barack Obama was so radical in his views about Israel that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu emerged shellshocked, ashen faced and traumatized after his first White House meeting with the newly-elected president in May 2009, according to an adviser who was present.",
      "author": "Aaron Klein",
      "content": "The detail was contained in an extensive New York Times Magazine story titled \u201cThe Secret History of the Push to Strike Iran.\u201d The story says it is based on accounts with \u201cdozens of current and former American, Israeli and European officials,\u201d including many top officials cited on the record such as Netanyahu himself. One section cites Uzi Arad, a former top Netanyahu adviser, describing the scene after Netanyahu emerged from his first private Oval Office meeting with Obama. The section also quotes Netanyahu confirming that Obama \u201cadopted most of the Palestinian narrative.\u201d The Times reported: During their first meeting in the White House in May 2009, anxious aides waited outside the Oval Office as the two leaders met alone. It was an interminable meeting, and some may have figured that the savvy, experienced Israeli prime minister was lecturing the young American president about the Palestinians and the hard truths of Israeli security. But when the door opened, it was Netanyahu who appeared shellshocked, Arad recalls: \u201cBibi did not say anything, but he looked ashen.\u201d It was hours later when he told aides that Obama had attacked him and implored him \u2014 actually demanded him, in Netanyahu\u2019s view \u2014 to freeze Israel\u2019s settlements in the West Bank right away, with \u201cnot a single brick\u201d added in the future, according to an Israeli official with direct knowledge of the meeting. \u201cBibi left that place traumatized,\u201d Arad says. Speaking now, Netanyahu says that \u201cObama came from another direction, one that adopted most of the Palestinian narrative,\u201d and ruefully cites the \u201cnot a single brick\u201d line to argue that the American president was against him from the very beginning. (A former Obama-administration official with knowledge of the White House meeting says that Obama did not in fact use that phrase.) It is instrumental that the ex-Obama official only denied using the \u201cnot a single brick\u201d phrase in relation to Israeli settlements but did not deny that the former president, as Netanyahu put it, \u201cadopted most of the Palestinian narrative.\u201d Nor did the ex-Obama official deny the description of Obama using the meeting to demand a complete halt to all Jewish construction in Judea and Samaria, which houses historic Jewish communities. After their meeting, it was widely reported that Obama pressed for a total halt to Jewish construction in the West Bank. \u201cThe demand for a total stop to building is not something that can be justified and I don\u2019t think that anyone here at this table accepts it,\u201d Netanyahu was quoted as telling his cabinet one week after the Oval Office meeting.

      "subtitle": "Joe Biden appeared to forget that his former running mate, Barack Obama, was America\u2019s \u201clast president\u201d during a speech in New Hampshire on Friday.",
      "author": "Haris Alic",
      "content": "The former vice president, who has worried even the staunchest of allies\u00a0with his frequent lapses on the campaign trail, made the slip-up when arguing there were \u201cnatural limits\u201d on constitutional rights like the Second Amendment. \u201cI\u2019m the only guy that\u2019s beaten the NRA, and my state is a big gun-owning state because of hunting,\u201d Biden told voters in Laconia, New Hampshire, before touting decades-long support for gun control. In particular, Biden highlighted his work authoring the initial assault weapons ban, which was part of his controversial 1994 crime bill. \u201cI\u2019m the only guy that\u2019s beaten them twice. I got assault weapons banned for ten years, it had to be reauthorized because of hanging chads in Florida,\u201d he said. \u201cThe last president said no, I\u2019m not going to reauthorize it.\u201d The statement struck many as confusing, since the most recent former occupant of the White House, Obama, was an avid supporter of gun control, especially prohibitions on firearms utilizing high-capacity magazines. Biden was likely referencing President George W. Bush, who in 2004 signaled he would not make renewing the 10-year-old ban a priority in an election year. Despite having publicly supported the ban in the past, Bush\u2019s lack of enthusiasm doomed efforts at reauthorization in the then-Republican controlled Congress.  This is the second time in less than a month that Biden has appeared to forget Obama, a man he has often fondly called his \u201cbrother,\u201d while campaigning. In August, Biden could not remember Obama\u2019s name when invoking his administration\u2019s legacy in dealing with Russia. \u201cThey invaded a significant portion of another country and annexed a significant portion of it called Crimea,\u201d Biden said when discussing Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine with voters in South Carolina. \u201cHe\u2019s saying it was President \u2014 my boss \u2014 it was his fault.\u201d The 76-year-old former vice president has also shown an inability to recollect\u00a0dates and places to the chagrin of some of his most prominent backers. Earlier this summer, Biden shocked the media establishment when he\u00a0claimed\u00a0to be vice president at the time of the\u00a0mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. \u201cThose kids in Parkland came up to see me when I was vice president,\u201d Biden said during a huddle with reporters in Iowa, before claiming that when the survivors visited Congress, lawmakers were \u201cbasically cowering, not wanting to see them. They did not want to face it on camera.\u201d The statement was quickly disproved as the shooting,\u00a0which resulted in 17 fatalities and over a dozen injuries, actually occurred on February 14, 2018 \u2014 more than a year after Biden left office. In response, Biden\u2019s team claimed the candidate had simply misspoken and pivoted to attacking the media for pushing it\u2019s own \u201cnarrative\u201d around the gaffes. \u201cThis is a press narrative, not a voter narrative,\u201d Biden\u2019s spokeswoman, Symone Sanders, asserted during an appearance on MSNBC. Sanders even went to the extent of lecturing the media on what it should and should not prioritize to \u201celevate the conversation\u201d surrounding the election. \u201cWe cannot allow this election to devolve in a tit for tat over name-calling and \u2018gaffes,\u2019 something that does not matter,\u201d she said. That argument, however, did not appear to sway many, including some of the left\u2019s most venerated journalists. Some, like Jamil Smith, a senior writer for\u00a0Rolling Stone\u00a0magazine, have even called on the former vice president\u2019s campaign to \u201cstep forward\u201d and explain \u201cwhat is going on with him.\u201d  In the last week alone, such suggestions have flourished as Biden\u2019s campaign struggles to dismiss controversy surrounding his fabrication of an emotional story about the war in Afghanistan. The controversy began when Biden told a story to more than 400 New Hampshire voters last month about how\u00a0he was asked\u00a0to travel to Afghanistan to honor a Navy captain during his tenure as vice president. As Biden recollected, he was asked by a four star general to travel to Kunar province in Afghanistan \u2014 \u201ca dangerous foray into \u2018godforsaken country\u2019\u201d \u2014 to honor an officer that \u201crappelled down a 60-foot ravine under fire and retrieved the body\u201d of a fallen comrade. When some suggested it might be too dangerous to send a sitting vice president into a war zone, Biden brushed away concerns for his own safety. \u201cWe can lose a vice president,\u201d he claimed to have said in response to such worries. \u201cWe can\u2019t lose many more of these kids. Not a joke.\u201d Apart from Biden supposedly putting his own life in jeopardy, the story was made more complicated as the officer in question did not want the honor being bestowed by his superiors. According to Biden, the captain was refusing the medal, a Silver Star, because he felt like a \u201cfailure\u201d because the comrade he was attempting to save died during the mission. \u201cHe said, \u2018Sir, I don\u2019t want the damn thing!\u2019\u201d Biden, his jaw clenched and nearly shouting, relayed to the audience in New Hampshire. \u201c\u2019Do not pin it on me, Sir! Please, Sir. Do not do that! He died. He died!\u2019\u201d Biden\u2019s emotional telling of the story left those in the audience \u201csilent\u201d and visibly moved. Unfortunately for the former vice president, though,\u00a0The Washington Post\u00a0found \u201calmost every detail of the story\u201d to be \u201cincorrect\u201d upon closer investigation. Biden visited Kunar province in 2008 as a U.S. senator, not as vice president. The service member who performed the celebrated rescue that Biden described was a 20-year-old Army specialist, not a much older Navy captain. And that soldier, Kyle J. White, never had a Silver Star, or any other medal, pinned on him by Biden. At a White House ceremony six years after Biden\u2019s visit, White stood at attention as President Barack Obama placed a Medal of Honor, the nation\u2019s highest award for valor, around his neck. In fact, the paper concluded that Biden had conflated three separate stories, including one in which he actually \u201cdid pin a medal on a heartbroken soldier, Army Staff Sgt. Chad Workman, who didn\u2019t believe he deserved the award.\u201d \u201cIn the space of three minutes, Biden got the time period, the location, the heroic act, the type of medal, the military branch and the rank of the recipient wrong, as well as his own role in the ceremony,\u201d the\u00a0Post\u00a0reported. Upon the story breaking, Biden\u2019s team immediately sought to downplay and dismiss the controversy. Biden, himself, asserted the central points of his story were accurate, even if the details were not. He even went to\u00a0 claim details are not an important part within the confines of the presidency. \u201cThe details are irrelevant in terms of decision-making,\u201d Biden explained to NPR this past week when asked if his fuzziness with specifics was problematic for anyone aspiring to be commander in chief. All of this has left Biden\u2019s surrogates and allies wondering if the former vice president would be benefited by fewer public appearances and less speaking time on the stump. \u201cI think Vice President Biden needs to speak less, and listen more, and let people talk,\u201d Iowa State Senator Tony Bisignano, one of the former vice president\u2019s top backers, told Politico on Friday.",

      "author": "Penny Starr",
      "content": "Barr asked one of the witnesses, Jason D. Delisle, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a series of questions about the companies that issue federal student loans. \u201cSome of your colleagues on the panel seem to be blaming the student loan servicing industry for the $1.5 trillion student loan crisis in this country,\u201d Barr said. \u201cDo student loan servicers advise students as to which school to attend or which degree to pursue?\u201d Barr asked. \u201cNo,\u201d Delisle said. \u201cThe servicer isn\u2019t involved in the front end of the loan dispersant at all.\u201d \u201cDo student loan servicers set tuition rates?\u201d Barr asked. \u201cNo,\u201d Delisle said. \u201cDo student loan servicers advise a student as to how much money to borrow?\u201d Barr asked, \u201cNo,\u201d Delisle responded, \u201cDo student loan servicers underwrite student loans at origination?\u201d Barr asked. \u201cNo,\u201d Delisle said. Barr then asked if these servicers \u201cactually issue debt to students?\u201d And whether they \u201cset the terms of the loan?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d Delisle answered both questions. Barr asked if they set the loan interest rate or \u201ccreate the income-based repayment plan.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d Delisle said. \u201cWho did that?\u201d \u201cCongress did and the Department of Education,\u201d Delisle said, \u201cDid they create the graduated repayment plan?\u201d Barr asked. \u201cIt\u2019s in statute, so Congress,\u201d Delisle said. Barr went on to lay out the case that student loan debt has become even worse since Barack Obama was president: Since the Democrat Congress and the Obama administration orchestrated the government takeover of student loans in 2010 the total amount of student loan debt has exploded. The federal government is now the largest consumer lender and owns or guarantees 92 percent of the more than $1.5 trillion in student loans. \u201cThe remaining roughly $100 billion are private loans,\u201d Barr said. \u201cThe number of federal student loan borrowers has exploded by 50 percent since the government takeover,\u201d Barr said. \u201cAt the end of 2018, 70 percent of college students graduated with student loan debt.\u201d Barr went on to say: Private loans, in contrast, with underwriting standards that actually involve underwriting that allows lenders to determine whether or not a borrower has the ability to repay have a repayment rate of 98 percent. Meanwhile data from the Federal Reserve suggests that approximately 20 percent of federal borrowers are either seriously delinquent or in default. Barr asked Delisle about the difference between private loans and federal loans and got a stunning answer. \u201cFederal loans are open access,\u201d Delisle said. \u201cSo, for example, if you lose your job and become unemployed you become an excellent candidate for a federal student loan.\u201d \u201cI think all of this is Exhibit A of not just the total incompetence of the federal government but the victimization of students by Congress, by the federal government, by the U.S. Department of Education,\u201d Barr said. \u201cI know everyone wants a boogeyman,\u201d Barr said. \u201cAnd the student loan servicers are a convenient boogeyman.\u201d \u201cBut guess what? Look in the mirror Congress,\u201d Barr said. \u201cCongress created this crisis.\u201d Barr said the federal government \u201cgave loans to students and didn\u2019t even care whether or not they had the ability to repay.\u201d \u201cMeanwhile, we have a dramatic shortage in the skilled trades,\u201d Barr said. \u201cWe have a dramatic shortage of nurses. We have a dramatic shortage of welders.\u201d Barr said that rather than scapegoat an industry that is just following laws created by Congress, they should be helping young people get good-paying jobs through a trade training education. \u201cLet\u2019s graduate these people with $100,000 a year jobs with no student debt,\u201d Barr said. \u201cThat might be a better solution than trying to blame an industry that\u2019s just following federal law created by Congress.\u201d The other witnesses at the hearing shared story after story about how Americans are struggling to pay off student loans, with many having to delay getting married, buying a home, and having children. \u201cLast year more than one million borrowers defaulted on a student loan,\u201d Seth Frotman, executive director of the Student Borrower Protection Center said at the hearing. \u201cThat\u2019s more than the population of each of your districts.\u201d \u201cIn fact, every 28 seconds another borrower defaults,\u201d Frotman said. \u201cThat\u2019s every 28 seconds of every hour, every day, every week, every year.\u201d Frotman called the student loan debt crisis \u201ca trillion-dollar black hole.\u201d Follow Penny Starr on Twitter",

      "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
      "content": "The 9th congressional district includes part of the Charlotte metropolitan area. While it is difficult to extrapolate lessons from a special election to a general election \u2014 much less a presidential one \u2014 a win Tuesday by Democrat Dan McCready would have been interpreted widely as a warning for President Donald Trump. The president bet heavily on the special election, holding a large rally there on Monday evening with Vice President Mike Pence. Bishop\u2019s win \u2014 which exceeded the margin by which McCready lost the district in the 2018 midterm elections \u2014 suggests that Trump still enjoys strong support among his base, and also that there could be a backlash against Democrat control of the U.S. House of Representatives, given the left-wing drift of the party. Charlotte has also provided a boost to presidential campaigns in the recent past. When President Barack Obama ran for re-election in 2012, the Democratic Party held its convention in the city. While Obama lost North Carolina and Indiana, after winning both in 2008, he held onto enough electoral votes elsewhere to win. North Carolina is an important battlefield for other reasons: it has been targeted by Obama and his former attorney general, Eric Holder, in their effort to wrest control of congressional re-districting from elected politicians and draw districts more amenable to Democrats. As in California, these efforts claim to be non-partisan but in effect set the system up to be gamed by well-organized Democrats. Bishop\u2019s win will allow Trump to tell a story of resurgence against the \u201cresistance\u201d in North Carolina and elsewhere. Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

      "subtitle": "Seven years after the September 11, 2012 attacks on the U.S. Special Mission in Benghazi, it is instructive to recall the Obama administration\u2019s altering of the now infamous talking points utilized to essentially mislead the American public about the coordinated assault that resulted in the deaths of Ambassador to Libya J. Christopher Stevens and three other US. Citizens.",
      "author": "Aaron Klein",
      "content": "The controversy surrounded the removal of references to terrorism while stressing an obscure anti-Islam film despite knowing it had little to nothing to do with the motivation for the assault. \u00a0The Obama administration\u2019s decision to publicize and even use taxpayer dollars to apologize for the Muhammad film while deceptively blaming it for the attacks likely helped to stir riots across the Islamic world by drawing attention to the previous unknown anti-Muhammad film. Some of the same personalities involved in the Benghazi talking points scandal would later play central roles in the Obama-era intelligence community\u2019s controversial investigation into collusion claims between Russia and President Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign. The curious tale of the talking points began when U.S. intelligence officials testified behind closed doors in early November 2012 and were asked point blank whether they had altered the points on which then-United Nations Ambassador Susan Rice based her original statements to the public about the Benghazi attacks. On Sunday, Sept. 16, 2012, Rice had appeared on five morning television programs to offer the official Obama administration response to the Benghazi attacks. In nearly identical statements, she asserted that the attacks were a spontaneous protest in response to a \u201chateful video.\u201d Other Obama administration officials made similar claims. Four days after Rice\u2019s misinformation, Obama himself was questioned on Sep. 20, about whether the Benghazi attack was carried out by terrorists.\u00a0 He Obama responded, \u201cWhat we do know is that the natural protests that arose because of the outrage over the video were used as an excuse by extremists to see if they can also directly harm U.S. interests.\u201d He was pressed at a town hall event hosted by Univision about whether al Qaeda was behind the assault, replying, \u201cWell, we don\u2019t know yet.\u201d It would later emerge the talking points were edited to remove references to \u201cterrorism\u201d and \u201cal-Qaeda\u201d in the attacks. The administration also removed information about at least five other previous attacks against foreign interests in Benghazi. An original draft stating, \u201cWe do know that Islamic extremists with ties to al-Qa\u2019ida participated in the attack\u201d was changed to \u201cwe know that they [Islamic extremists] \u00a0participated in the protests.\u201d\u00a0 Another bullet changed the word \u201cattack\u201d to \u201cviolent demonstrations.\u201d Surveillance video from the mission later showed there were no significant popular protests on September 11, 2012. Greggory Hicks, the No. 2 U.S. official in Libya at the time of the Sept. 11, 2012, attacks, testified that he knew immediately the attacks were terror strikes, not a protest turned violent. According to Hicks, \u201ceverybody in the mission\u201d believed it was an act of terror \u201cfrom the get-go.\u201d Two congressional sources who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity said Mike Morell, then acting CIA director, along with Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, and National Counterterrorism Center Director Matthew Olsen each testified behind closed doors that they did not alter the talking points.\u00a0 On Nov. 16, 2012, former CIA director David Petraeus testified before the same congressional intelligence committee and also replied no to the question of whether he had changed the talking points, three congressional sources told Reuters. Then on Nov. 27 the CIA reportedly told lawmakers that it had in fact changed the wording of the unclassified talking points to delete a reference to al-Qaida, according to senators who met with Morell that day. That Nov. 27 meeting was between Morell, Rice and Sens. Lindsey Graham and Kelly Ayotte and the late John McCain. A statement by McCain, Graham and Ayotte specifically related that Morell told the senators during the meeting that the FBI had removed references to al-Qaida from the talking points \u201cand did so to prevent compromising an ongoing criminal investigation\u201d of the attack on the U.S. mission. The senators\u2019 joint statement specifically reads: \u201cAround 10:00 this morning in a meeting requested by Ambassador Rice, accompanied by acting CIA Director Mike Morell, we asked Mr. Morell who changed the unclassified talking points to remove references to al-Qaida. In response, Mr. Morell said the FBI removed the references and did so to prevent compromising an ongoing criminal investigation. We were surprised by this revelation and the reasoning behind it.\u201d Morell\u2019s likely misleading claim was repeated to the news media. On Nov. 28, 2012, Sharyl Attkisson, then at CBS News, quoted the CIA stating the edits to the talking points were made \u201cso as not to tip off al-Qaida as to what the U.S. knew, and to protect sources and methods.\u201d\u00a0 That same report quoted a source from the Office of the Director for National Intelligence, aka James Clapper, telling CBS News\u2019 Margaret Brennan that Clapper\u2019s office made the edits as part of the interagency process because the links to al-Qaida were deemed too \u201ctenuous\u201d to make public. Meanwhile, a few hours after his meeting with the senators, Morell\u2019s office reportedly contacted Graham and stated that Morell \u201cmisspoke\u201d in the earlier meeting and that it was, in fact, the CIA, not the FBI, that deleted the al-Qaida references. \u201cThey were unable to give a reason as to why,\u201d stated Graham of the strange about face.\u00a0 \u201cCIA officials contacted us and indicated that Acting Director Morell misspoke in our earlier meeting. The CIA now says that it deleted the al-Qaida references, not the FBI. They were unable to give a reason as to why,\u201d Graham said in a statement. An intelligence official called Morell\u2019s change \u201can honest mistake and it was corrected as soon as it was realized. There is nothing more to this.\u201d\u00a0 A U.S. intelligence official further told CBS News there was \u201cabsolutely no intent to misinform.\u201d The official claimed the talking points \u201cwere never meant to be definitive and, in fact, noted that the assessment may change. The points clearly reflect the early indications of extremist involvement in a direct result. It wasn\u2019t until after they were used in public that analysts reconciled contradictory information about how the assault began.\u201d Graham at the time went so far as to suggest he would hold up the nomination of Morell if Obama had nominated him to be the CIA director, a position ultimately filled by John Brennan. All of the sudden, in June 2013, Morell announced he was stepping down to spend more time with his family. In a statement, Morell acknowledged that his reason for stepping down may seem somewhat difficult to swallow, but \u201cwhen I say that it is time for my family, nothing could be more real than that.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 Morell served 33 years in the agency and was a frontrunner for CIA director.\u00a0 Morell later reemerged as a counselor to Beacon Global Strategies, a consult group particularly close to Hillary Clinton.\u00a0 The firm is led by Philippe I. Reines, who served from 2009 to 2013 as Clinton\u2019s Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Strategic Communications and Senior Communications Advisor. In February 2014 a bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee report revealed that Morell was in receipt of critical information on Sep. 15, 2012, one day before Rice used the talking points publically. The report said that Morell and others at the CIA received an email from the CIA\u2019s Libya station chief stating the attacks were \u201cnot/not an escalation of protests.\u201d\u00a0 So on the same day Morell helped to edit the talking points by calling the attacks a \u201cdemonstration,\u201d he received information from his own station chief clearly contradicting this claim. FoxNews.com quoted Sam Faddis, an expert on the U.S. intelligence community, explaining, \u201cThe chief of station is the senior intelligence officer for the entire United States government\u2026You would really have to have some incredibly overwhelming factual evidence to disregard that and there is no indication of that in the report at all.\u201d In perhaps one of the most damning sections of a Republican House Interim Progress Report on the events in Benghazi, lawmakers who penned the investigation wrote they were given access to classified emails and other communications that prove the talking points were not edited to protect classified information but instead to protect the Clinton State Department\u2019s reputation. \u201cEvidence rebuts administration claims that the talking points were modified to protect classified information or to protect an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI),\u201d the report states, directly contradicting Morell\u2019s claims. The report charges that the talking points were \u201cdeliberately\u201d edited to \u201cprotect the State Department.\u201d It is instructive to briefly quote the report: To protect the State Department, the administration deliberately removed references to al-Qaida-linked groups and previous attacks in Benghazi in the talking points used by [United Nations] Ambassador [Susan] Rice, thereby perpetuating the deliberately misleading and incomplete narrative that the attacks evolved from a demonstration caused by a YouTube video. Senior State Department officials requested \u2013 and the White House approved \u2013 that the details of the threats, specifics of the previous attacks, and previous warnings be removed to insulate the department from criticism that it ignored the threat environment in Benghazi. The report authors said that they went through email exchanges of the interagency process to scrub the talking points. They wrote the emails do not reveal any concern with protecting classified information. \u201cAdditionally, the bureau (FBI) itself approved a version of the talking points with significantly more information about the attacks and previous threats than the version that the State Department requested. Thus, the claim that the State Department\u2019s edits were made solely to protect that investigation is not credible.\u201d In a particularly stinging accusation, the report states that when draft talking points were sent to officials throughout the executive branch, senior State Department officials requested the talking points be changed \u201cto avoid criticism for ignoring the threat environment in Benghazi.\u201d \u201cSpecifically, State Department emails reveal senior officials had \u2018serious concerns\u2019 about the talking points, because members of Congress might attack the State Department for \u2018not paying attention to agency warnings\u2019 about the growing threat in Benghazi. Deceiving the American public is bad enough. Adding insult to injury, the Obama administration\u2019s decision to blame the Muhammad film for alleged protests served to further inflame the Islamic world against the U.S., leading to deadly rioting. The administration even spent $70,000 in taxpayer funds on an ad campaign denouncing an anti-Muhammad film. The ads reportedly aired on seven Pakistani networks. They also came in response to protests in Pakistan that were reportedly a reaction to the film. However, it was the claim of popular protests in Benghazi at the time that garnered the biggest public reaction from the White House. The Sept. 19, 2012, ads featured Obama and Hillary Clinton making statements against the film in the wake of the Benghazi attacks. \u201cSince our founding, the United States has been a nation of respect, that respects all faiths. We reject all efforts to denigrate the religious beliefs of others,\u201d Obama says in the ad, which was stamped \u201cpaid content.\u201d Clinton then denies any official U.S. involvement in producing the \u201cInnocence of Muslims\u201d video. \u201cWe absolutely reject its contents,\u201d she says. Meanwhile, some of the same personalities involved in the Benghazi talking points scandal played key roles in perpetuating the Russia collusion narrative. Clinton\u2019s campaign, of course, funded the anti-Trump dossier produced by GPS and reportedly utilized by the FBI as a \u201croadmap\u201d for its questionable collusion probe. Brennan\u2019s CIA reportedly convened a \u201csecret task force at CIA headquarters composed of several dozen analysts and officers from the CIA, the NSA and the FBI\u201d that formed the early stages of the Russia probe, stages now under investigation by the Trump administration. Brennan and Clapper were among the few Obama-era officials originally allowed access to the Russia intelligence, according to the Washington Post. Disgraced ex-FBI Director James Comey, Brennan and Clapper are the subjects of a dispute over which top Obama administration officials advocated for the infamous, Clinton-funded Steele dossier to be utilized as evidence in the Russia collusion investigation. The argument recently erupted into the open with a Brennan surrogate being quoted in the news media opposing Comey not long after Attorney General William Barr appointed a U.S. attorney to investigate the origins of the Russia collusion claims. Rice, also involved in the talking points scandal, was documented as being present in the Oval Office for a controversial briefing about the Russia probe. In an action characterized as \u201codd\u201d last year by then-Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, Rice memorialized the confab in an email to herself describing Obama as starting \u201cthe conversation by stressing his continued commitment to ensuring that every aspect of this issue is handled by the Intelligence and law enforcement communities \u2018by the book.\u2019\u201d In actions connected to the Russia investigation, Rice reportedly unmasked senior members of Trump\u2019s presidential campaign.

The pair left Perth, Western Australia, in June 2017 by off road vehicle bound for the UK, planning to travel for two years driving across 36 countries. They\u00a0have been documenting their travels on Instagram and Youtube with a stated aim of going to countries less likely to fall on the average traveller\u2019s radar due to unsympathetic media coverage. \u201cOur biggest motivation behind making the vlogs is to hopefully inspire anyone wanting to travel, and also try to break the stigma around travelling to countries which get a bad wrap (sic) in the media,\u201d they said\u00a0in a post on crowd-funding platform Patreon. The young British-Australian woman and her Australian partner were arrested 10 weeks ago, as Breitbart News reported. King and Firkin have frequently used a drone in photos and videos published of their travels through Australia, Asia and the Middle East, with nearly 19,000 people following their adventures on their Instagram page. \u201cOur families hope to see Mark and Jolie safely home as soon as possible,\u201d their families said in a statement Thursday, issued by the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. \u201cWe have no further comment to make at this stage and ask that the media respects our privacy at this difficult time.\u201d There was no immediate comment on the matter either from Iranian officials, nor state media.  Cases involving dual nationals typically end up in closed-door hearings of Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Court, where former detainees say they had no opportunity to defend themselves against spying charges or offer evidence. Analysts and family members of dual nationals and others detained in Iran long have said hard-liners in the Islamic Republic\u2019s security agencies use the prisoners as bargaining chips in negotiations with the West. A U.N. panel in 2018 described \u201can emerging pattern involving the arbitrary deprivation of liberty of dual nationals\u201d in Iran, which Tehran denied. Deals can be made with Iran for the release of prisoners however this often involves the transfer of large amounts of cash to the Islamic republic. Just such a prisoner exchange was brokered by former U.S. President Barack Obama in January 2016 that freed Washington Post journalist Jason Rezaian and three other Iranian-Americans. It saw the U.S. make a $1.7 billion cash delivery to Iran the same day the hostages were allowed to walk free. The Obama administration defended the payment to Iran as a \u201ca very good deal for U.S. taxpayers.\u201d It\u2019s unclear what Australia would offer \u2013 if anything \u2013 in return for the release of the pair of its nationals languishing in the infamous Evin jail in the capital of Tehran.",

That Jefferson Davis was a Democrat; that Stonewall Jackson strongly identified with the Democratic Party; that secessionists in the South saw themselves as Democrats and were Democrats; that so much of the Democratic Party\u2019s history, since it is our nation\u2019s oldest political party, has its roots in slavery.\u201d Rep.\u00a0Lee said her party is \u201cbuilding the political will\u201d to jumpstart the reparations commission. But Democrats never possessed more political will than they did a decade ago. During Barack Obama\u2019s first two years in office, Democrats held majorities in the House and a filibuster proof majority in the Senate. Democrats could have easily passed any bill they wanted and no reparations bill ever made its way to Obama\u2019s desk. The Texas Congresswoman says her new bill \u201cis not symbolic.\u201d Of course it is. The reparations bill is a symbol, a political bludgeon meant to beat decent people over the head with, to assure racial healing can never happen in America. Democrats know and count on the fact that a relationship cannot be repaired without forgiveness, without the injured party agreeing to move on. Democrats choose to pick at this scab, even 150 years after America\u2019s first Republican president led the abolishment of slavery. Democrats don\u2019t want racial healing. What Democrats want is to use reparations as one more wedge issue to continue to castigate America as an unrelentingly\u00a0racist country, where non-whites must live in a state of constant fear that the bigotry bogeyman is lurking around every corner. So goes the logic on the political left:\u00a0Yes white America is racist because they don\u2019t want to pay for the sins of their great-great-great-great-great-great grandparents, for something they had nothing to do with, for something no black person born this\u00a0century suffers from. If this resurgent push for reparations and Rep. Lee\u2019s new bill is not symbolic, it smacks of stupid.\u00a0Which brings us back to the pro-reparations Democrats running for president. \u201cWhen I am elected president, I will sign that bill,\u201d Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) said in April at an Al Sharpton-led political event.\u00a0Harris\u2019 ancestors owned slaves.\u00a0Sen.\u00a0Cory Booker (D-NJ) introduced a Senate version of Rep. Lee\u2019s bill. White House hopefuls Sens. Harris, Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Bernie Sanders (D-VT), and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) have all co-sponsored Booker\u2019s bill. Other 2020 candidates, Mayor of South Bend, Indiana,\u00a0Pete Buttigieg, former HUD secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, and entrepreneur Andrew Yang have all endorsed studying reparations. Self-help guru Marianne Williamson proposed a plan to spend $200 billion to $500 billion for reparations. Former Vice President Joe Biden wants to \u201chave\u00a0conversation about reparations.\u201d He spent the summer defending and then apologizing for his record of working with segregationist senators in the 1970s. Biden\u00a0said in 1975 that he\u2019d be \u201cdamned\u201d to feel \u201cresponsible to pay for something that happened 300 years ago.\u201d Apparently \u201cdamned\u201d no more, the Democrat front-runner stood on the debate stage on Thursday night and was asked \u201cwhat responsibility do you think that Americans need to take to repair the legacy of slavery in our country?\u201d Biden, his teeth literally falling out of his mouth, detailed a plan to address his party\u2019s centuries of enforcing racial oppression on black people that essentially boiled down to\u00a0sending social workers into black homes \u201cto help them deal with how to raise their children,\u201d because, as he put it, \u201cthey don\u2019t know quite what to do.\u201d Robert Francis \u201cBeto\u201d O\u2019Rourke \u2014\u00a0whose family (and his wife, Amy\u2019s family) owned slaves \u2014\u00a0supports paying reparations. The former Texas Congressman said he\u00a0\u201creached out\u201d to Bryan Stevenson who directed him to\u00a0the National Memorial For Peace And Justice in Montgomery, Alabama, which is\u00a0dedicated to the enslaved black people and those terrorized by lynching and Jim Crow segregation in America. \u201c[Stevenson] said stories like these need to\u00a0be told in every single community,\u201d O\u2019Rourke explained. I agree. Americans in every community in this country should know that the world\u2019s largest lynching memorial is a testament to the Democratic Party\u2019s legacy of racism. Indeed, an era of terror in America between 1830 and 1960 saw several thousand lynchings of both blacks and whites. A breathtaking brutality, furiously enforced first by pro-slavery zealots and later by segregationists to intimidate and subdue civil rights activists and abolitionists. Research compiled by various organizations from the Tuskegee Institute to the Equal Justice Initiative documents more than a century of savagery. This torment, while racially inspired, was inflicted for political ends. Lynchings in America peaked precisely at the dawn of the Ku Klux Klan\u2019s inception. As Pulitzer Prize-winning historian and professor at Columbia University Eric Foner notes, \u201cFounded as a Tennessee social club, the Ku Klux Klan spread into nearly every Southern state, launching a \u2018reign of terror\u2019 against Republican leaders \u2014 black and white.\u201d The pro-slavery KKK, writes University of North Carolina emeritus professor of history Allen W. Trelease, \u201cbecame in effect a terrorist arm of the Democratic party.\u201d A sculpture commemorating the slave trade greets visitors at the entrance National Memorial For Peace And Justice on April 26, 2018 in Montgomery, Alabama. The memorial is dedicated to the legacy of enslaved black people and those terrorized by lynching and Jim Crow segregation in America. Conceived by the Equal Justice Initiative, the physical environment is intended to foster reflection on America\u2019s history of racial inequality. (Bob Miller/Getty Images) Ed Sykes, 77, visits the National Memorial For Peace And Justice on April 26, 2018 in Montgomery, Alabama. Sykes, who has family in Mississippi, was distraught when he discovered his last name in the memorial, three months after finding it on separate memorial in Clay County, Mississippi. (Bob Miller/Getty Images) Let me be the first to invite this horde of millionaires and political elites, standing on debates stages, sprinting across the country, half of them white-\u2018splaining black oppression, to apologize for the their party\u2019s historic, centuries-long legacy of expanding slavery, lynchings, black codes, and Jim Crow laws throughout America. They can also lead by example and start writing checks to their favorite black philanthropic organization. Is there any wonder than why Democrat.org is missing more than 100 years of history from its history page?\u00a0The history highlighted on the Democrat\u2019s official party website begins in 1920! What\u2019s more? Democratic presidential candidates were against reparations before they were for them. Indeed, Barack\u00a0Obama never supported reparations. He\u00a0said in 2004 that a one-time payoff\u00a0\u201cwould be an excuse for some to say we\u2019ve paid our debt.\u201d He also recently\u00a0addressed\u00a0the inherent unfairness of forcing millions of Americans to compensate for sins that occurred one hundred years before their parents immigrated to this country. Democratic voters are split on the issue of paying cash reparations to\u00a0the descendants of slaves. Just 49 percent\u00a0of Democrats endorse the idea. Thankfully, over two-thirds of all Americans reject it. Politically, reparations is a wildly unpopular idea. Practically, its merits are nearly nonexistent. A paper published by Social Science Quarterly estimated cash reparations payments could cost between $5.9 trillion and $14.2 trillion. Who exactly would be on the hook, 150 years later, to pay a $14 trillion debt? Would\u00a0ancestors of the more than 642,000 Union soldiers who died to abolish slavery be exempt? What about the\u00a02\u00a0million men who risked their lives during the war? The United States became home to more immigrants in the three decades after the Civil War than during the previous\u00a0three centuries combined. They and their ancestors had nothing to do with slavery.\u00a0By 1907\u00a01.3 million people had entered the country through Ellis Island alone. Again, they and their ancestors had nothing to do with slavery.\u00a0More than 50 million more people immigrated here over the next four decades. They and their ancestors had nothing to do with slavery.\u00a0Would we exclude these innocents from paying reparations? What about the more than 8 million Americans who in the 2010 census identified as two or more races. There are 3.1 million African-Americans who identify themselves as mixed race. Another 1.8 million people self-identified as\u00a0white and black. What happens to them? This nonsense is why I wrote\u00a050 Things They Don\u2019t Want You to know. The legacy of Black America is one of great accomplishment in the face of incalculable evil. At a time when most blacks were constantly told to feel inferior to whites, many performed to the contrary. At the turn of the century, former slaves showed a Herculean hunger to learn how to read and write. In just a few decades after gaining freedom, black literacy rates skyrocketed from around 20 percent to roughly 70 percent. Chattel slavery destroyed countless family units and an untold number of lineages were lost. But something remarkable happened from 1890 to 1940; a slightly higher percentage of black adults had married than white adults, according to census data. What\u2019s more? The first public high school for blacks in America sent gradates to Harvard and other Ivy League schools as early as 1903. These achievements occurred despite\u00a0the Democratic Party\u2019s political terrorism after Reconstruction, when wanton lynchings, rape, and arson of black people and their property persisted. This long campaign of racial savagery by Democrats and the Ku Klux Klan before and during the Civil Rights Movement cast a long shadow over African Americans in this country. Today, too many Democrat-run inner cities are black-on-black killing fields. This happened despite the explosion of black social and economic dynamism that began to take form post-World War II.\u00a0It is also true that we blacks have now spent several decades avoiding turning the spotlight on ourselves. We\u2019ve too often blamed what\u2019s clearly a genocidal self-destruction on racism and faceless societal woes. We\u2019re overwhelmingly responsible for putting each other in body bags; sending each other to the morgue, our bodies riddled with bullets. Yet, the political left insists that we\u2019re not supposed to ask how racism is responsible for that havoc? Black childbearing-aged women make up four percent of the population but account for over 35 percent of all abortions. Is this glaring disregard for the black unborn also the fault of racism? Democrats want us to believe it is. What about the\u00a070 percent illegitimacy rate among blacks (90 percent in some inner cities)? This is self-sabotage. These failures are on us. We all know Democrats run the governments in the cities that routinely fail to protect their people. What have decades of punditry, political grandstanding, and civil rights posturing done to lift legions of poor blacks out of their plight? After decades of oppressing us and then proving utterly impotent and useless in fixing the cultural cancers that continue to vex our communities, Democrats are now dangling reparations in our faces. It\u2019s time black America left the party of slavery for good.

      "author": "Breitbart Jerusalem",
      "content": "Politico\u2019s anonymously sourced article, which claims Israeli intelligence under Netanyahu\u2019s administration spied on the Trump administration, was released just days before a critical election in Israel. The wild claim does not cite any U.S. government agency but instead relies upon \u201cthree former senior U.S. officials with knowledge of the matter\u201d who purport to know that the \u201cU.S. government concluded within the past two years that Israel was most likely behind the placement of cellphone surveillance devices that were found near the White House and other sensitive locations around Washington.\u201d The Israeli government has strongly denied the allegations. A senior U.S. official was quoted as saying the Politico story \u201cis completely false. Absolutely false. I checked.\u201d President Trump himself said of the story: \u201cI find that hard to believe.\u201d Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Trump further said, \u201cI don\u2019t believe that. No, I don\u2019t believe that the Israelis are spying on us.\u201d On Friday, Netanyahu released a campaign ad promoting a Fox News segment from last week in which radio star and weekend cable host Mark Levin said Joel Benenson was behind the Politico piece. Benenson was a strategist for Obama\u2019s 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns and served as chief strategist for Hillary Clinton\u2019s failed 2016 campaign. He is currently advising Netanyahu\u2019s main opponent, Benny Gantz, and Gantz\u2019s Blue and White party. \u201cYesterday you heard the lies that Israel tried to spy on the White House, a complete lie,\u201d Netanyahu began in the Hebrew-language campaign video. Netanyahu cited Levin as saying \u201cthis is exactly like the tricks carried out by Joel Benenson. He was an adviser to Obama and now he is the adviser to [Blue and White leaders Benny] Gantz and [Yair] Lapid.\u201d \u201cFor them everything is kosher,\u201d added Netanyahu. \u201cThey are willing to do anything\u00a0 and don\u2019t care if they damage this valuable asset, our relationship with the United States and my relationship with the president.\u201d \u201cEverything is kosher to garner an extra few votes and bring in a left-wing government. Don\u2019t believe these lies,\u201d Netanyahu stated. Blue and White co-founder Yair Lapid strongly rejected the charge about Benenson and claimed that Netanyahu had \u201cgone off the rails.\u201d \u201cYesterday we supported Bibi over the eavesdropping allegation, today he said we instigated it. Never mind being a liar, what about some national responsibility? The man has gone off the rails,\u201d tweeted Lapid. Breitbart\u2019s Aaron Klein took a closer look at the Politico story, writing that the alleged plot \u201creveals glaring red flags.\u201d The Politico story by Daniel Lippman charges: The miniature surveillance devices, colloquially known as \u201cStingRays,\u201d mimic regular cell towers to fool cellphones into giving them their locations and identity information. Formally called international mobile subscriber identity-catchers or IMSI-catchers, they also can capture the contents of calls and data use. The devices were likely intended to spy on President Donald Trump, one of the former officials said, as well as his top aides and closest associates \u2014 though it\u2019s not clear whether the Israeli efforts were successful. Klein noted that a reader needs to scroll down a full 28 paragraphs to arrive at the detail that such IMSI-catchers can also be made by \u201csophisticated hobbyists\u201d or those willing to pay more than $150,000 for each device. Lippman allows: IMSI-catchers, which are often used by local police agencies to surveil criminals, can also be made by sophisticated hobbyists or by the Harris Corp., the manufacturer of StingRays, which cost more than $150,000 each, according to Vice News. Writes Klein: \u201cSo we are to believe that technology behemoth Israel, with some of the most capable and proven minds in high-tech, risked blowing up its relationship with its closest and most important ally by recklessly planting physical spying devices near the White House that \u201ccan also be made by sophisticated hobbyists.\u201d A simple Google search under \u2018IMSI catcher\u2019 turns up less sophisticated devices for as low as $249.95 and countless websites describing how to make IMSIs.\u201d \u201cThe improbable plot gets even more absurd,\u201d continued Klein. The Breitbart Jerusalem bureau chief pointed to a story from September 2014 in which CNBC first exclusively reported about a technology company that discovered \u201cas many as 15 cellphone interception devices secretly operating in the nation\u2019s capital, capable of illicitly identifying the movements of prominent people, recording audio from mobile phones, listening to calls and reading email.\u201d CNBC reported on the IMSI-catchers and even spent an afternoon driving around Washington with experts \u201cwhose devices registered several malicious attempts to probe the phones.\u201d The news agency related that they contacted the FBI and Department of Justice to seek comment on the discovery of the devices. The CNBC reporter who authored the story, Eamon Javers, tweeted on Thursday that Politico\u2019s Lippman \u201cprovides a likely answer to a mystery I first reported on back in 2014 \u2013 Who\u2019s hacking DC\u2019s cell phones?\u201d Lippman himself retweeted Javers\u2019 tweet linking his 2014 article on IMSI-catchers in D.C. to Politico\u2019s story citing former officials as claiming that Israel was operating such devices in America\u2019s capital to spy on Trump. Klein posited: So we are to believe that Israel risked spying on the Trump administration using devices that were not only planted in the open but similar to or even the same as the IMSI-catchers in D.C. first reported in the news media five years ago. And, according to this outlandish narrative, Israel continued to deploy such easily discoverable devices for years even after CNBC revealed those attempts and publicly reported that it alerted the FBI about the IMSI-catchers. We are to further believe that Israel has been spying in D.C. using devices so unsophisticated that civilian experts cited by CNBC in 2014 discovered similar snooping attempts with just one afternoon drive around the Capital.

      "author": "Robert Kraychik",
      "content": "Pollack joined Monday\u2019s edition of SiriusXM\u2019s Breitbart News Tonight to discuss with hosts Rebecca Mansour and Joel Pollak his recently published book,\u00a0Why Meadow Died: The People and Policies that Created the Parkland Shooter and Endanger America\u2019s Students. \u201cThis is what led to my daughter getting killed, these policies of not holding kids accountable,\u201d said Pollack, addressing last week\u2019s passage of SB 419 in California, which\u00a0bans suspensions of willfully defiant students from kindergarten to grade eight. \u201cThe bill that got passed, it\u2019s illegal in the state of California to suspend or expel a disruptive child, and that just went into law,\u201d Pollack said. \u201cHow is it going to affect them when there\u2019s no consequence of discipline in the classroom? When the teacher has to spend 10 [or] 15 minutes per class [or] learning session on handling disruptive kids.\u201d LISTEN: Pollak commented, \u201cThis bill is signed as some sort of social justice measure.\u201d \u201cThat ideology, for someone to think that way, it\u2019s the exact opposite, okay?\u201d replied Pollack. \u201cYou need to hold children accountable when they\u2019re juveniles and teach them right from wrong so you set them up for success when they\u2019re over 18 and adults.\u201d \u201cThis liberal ideology of not holding kids accountable [is not] going to work,\u201d Pollack added. Pollack recalled the implementation of the Obama administration\u2019s PROMISE Program\u00a0(Preventing Recidivism through Opportunities, Mentoring, Interventions, Supports & Education), which was\u00a0oriented around racial and ethnic quotas\u00a0for application of disciplinary measures in schools. The program\u2019s advocates marketed it as a manifestation of \u201crestorative justice.\u201d Pollack said, \u201cIn Broward County, felonies from 18 to 25 have risen since they implemented these policies. So if you\u2019re a parent and you\u2019re in California, you can\u2019t put your ideology ahead of your kids\u2019 safety.\u201d \u201cThese people that also implemented this stuff, they\u2019re guilty, too,\u201d added Pollack. \u201cThey killed my daughter. That\u2019s what I say. It\u2019s not just [the murderer]. They all did it. I owe it to my daughter to hold every single one of these people accountable.\u201d Left-wing broadening of the \u201cspecial needs\u201d category of students began to include violent and \u201cemotionally disturbed\u201d children, Pollack said. \u201cWhen they have a kid [who is] emotionally disturbed, and they label him \u2018special needs,\u2019 it gives them more rights, and it makes them untouchable in the school,\u201d explained Pollack. \u201cThat\u2019s what happened with my daughter\u2019s murderer. He was in the school, and they labeled him \u2018special needs,\u2019 but for violence. It wasn\u2019t like he was just a kid with a learning disability. That\u2019s one of the horrible policies.\u201d Pollack went on. \u201cAnother one is this PROMISE Program, which is restorative justice, that came out with the Obama administration that wanted to end the school-to-prison pipeline, and when you think about it, in actuality, instead of ending it, it creates the school-to-prison pipeline. These liberals that put it in place, they don\u2019t realize it, that by not holding these kids accountable, they create the school-to-prison pipeline when these kids become adults.\u201d Breitbart News Tonight airs Monday through Friday on SiriusXM\u2019s Patriot channel 125 from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern (6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Pacific).

Thunberg \u2014 who led a global \u201cFridays for Future\u201d school walkout for climate change \u2014 told The Guardian\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s insane that a 16-year-old has to cross the Atlantic in order to take a stand, but that\u2019s how it is. It feels like we are at a breaking point.\u201d What\u2019s insane is our sycophantic media and political elites bending over backwards to prop up a girl who was a toddler when Al Gore began ringing the climate alarm bells; a child whose solution to our looming doom is to rely on world leaders to \u201ccome up with some sort of solution.\u201d Americans don\u2019t need or want a carefully crafted lecture from a 16-year-old about carbon emissions when that the U.S. has constantly led the world in reductions. As I uncover in my newly released book,\u00a0U.S. carbon emissions output stands in sharp contrast with major polluters like Russia, Iran, the European Union, and China, whose greenhouse gas emission increases are more than three times the U.S.\u2019s decreases. Even if we pared our emissions to absolute zero \u2014 ground every plane, parked every car, leveled our cities, mandated mud huts to live in, and made subsistence farming law \u2014 it\u2019s already too late according to Andrew Yang, who admitted during the second Democratic presidential debate that America only contributes 15 percent of the world\u2019s carbon emissions.  Greta testified before the U.S. Congress on Wednesday. It was a snoozfest. But I dare the teen activist to take her climate alarmism tour to Communist China or Iran or unabashed polluter North Korea. These countries are the driving force behind a world where carbon emissions continue to rise. But the teen\u00a0Nobel Peace Prize nominee won\u2019t do that, I\u2019m sure. Her handlers won\u2019t let her go near the borders of those countries because they know it won\u2019t end well: Greta will either be shown the door or thrown in a cell. Greta Thunberg is all panic and no plan. That\u2019s why she came to America, where like-minded Democrats are already peddling trillion dollar plans to tax the U.S. economy into the pre-industrial era.",

      "content": "Ginsburg, who has faced a number of medical battles in recent years, appeared at an event in New York City Wednesday with\u00a0NPR\u2019s Nina Totenberg and addressed the critics who say she should have taken the opportunity to retire when Obama was in office and in a position to appoint a progressive judge in her place. \u201cWhen that suggestion is made, I ask the question: Who do you think the president could nominate that could get through the Republican Senate, who you would prefer on the court than me?\u201d Ginsburg said, according to CNBC. The 86-year-old Supreme Court justice was recently treated for pancreatic cancer, which was discovered during a blood test in July. Ginsburg underwent radiation therapy at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City last month:  Doctors said at the time the rest of her body is cancer-free, and the justice told a crowd at the National\u00a0Book Festival in Washington D.C. she is on her way to being \u201cvery well\u201d:  That has not been Ginsburg\u2019s only health battle. As Breitbart News reported: Ginsburg, the liberal face of the Supreme Court, has fought cancer on and off for roughly two decades. She underwent a procedure to remove malignant nodules from her left lung on December 21st of last year. The cancerous growths were discovered while receiving treatment for a fall in her office. Ginsburg missed the court\u2019s oral arguments for several days in February, participating in cases using transcripts \u2014 a first in the justice\u2019s 25-year tenure on the bench. Ginsburg has experienced several health issues in recent years. The justice underwent cancer surgeries in 1999 and 2009 and broke her ribs in at least two separate occasions. In 2014, Ginsburg had a stent inserted into her heart. Despite her health issues, Ginsburg signaled no signs of retiring, telling Totenberg that her job keeps her going. \u201cThis is my fourth cancer bout, and I found each time that when I am active I am much better than when I am just lying about feeling sorry for myself,\u201d Ginsburg explained. \u201cThe necessity to get up and go is stimulating. And somehow, all these appearances I\u2019ve had since the end of August, whatever my temporary disability is, it stops, and I\u2019m okay for the event,\u201d she continued, echoing the remarks she made at D.C\u2019s\u00a0National\u00a0Book Festival in August. \u201cIt\u2019s the best and the hardest job I\u2019ve ever had.

      "author": "Jack Montgomery",
      "content": "Mr Cameron claimed that the American national populist won the contest to become Republican candidate in the 2016 presidential race through \u201cprotectionist, xenophobic, misogynistic interventions\u201d in his memoirs, according to The Guardian. While the U.S. leader has acted to prevent American jobs from being outsourced to sweatshop economies, expressed a desire to curb illegal immigration, and declined to describe himself as a \u201cfeminist\u201d, Cameron as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom grovelled to the Chinese Communist Party, presided over record levels of mass migration, and endorsed social justice dogma on issues such as the likely fictitious gender pay gap.  Mr Cameron, like many other so-called \u201cliberal conservatives\u201d, also denounced President Trump\u2019s rhetoric, particularly as it pertained to radical Islamic terrorism. \u201cI always tried to speak about \u2018Islamist extremism\u2019 and \u2018Islamist extremist violence\u2019 rather than just use the label \u2018Islamist\u2019,\u201d the politically correct former prime minister wrote. \u201cDonald Trump doesn\u2019t bother with that distinction. Indeed, he goes in the other direction, frequently referring to \u2018Islamic terrorism\u2019 which in my view is extremely unhelpful,\u201d he complained, confirming that his tendency to equivocate on the subject was indeed deliberate, as more forthright conservatives always believed. Cameron, who was prime minister at a time when, to quote The Guardian, \u201cBritish and American hostages were being beheaded by [Islamic State] fighters\u201d, also expressed his bitterness that the terror network\u2019s physical caliphate was destroyed after President Trump took office. \u201cFor all the subsequent bluster and boasting of Donald Trump, he was given a war that was well on its way to being won,\u201d Cameron whined, attempting to discredit the President\u2019s claims that the erstwhile caliphate \u2014 which reached its greatest extent under the premierships of Cameron and Obama \u2014 was defeated after he took office because he \u201ctotally changed the rules of engagement\u201d.  Cameron\u2019s signature foreign policy intervention prior to backing the Syrian rebel movement which later spawned the Islamic State was in Libya \u2014 a costly fiasco which\u00a0transformed the North African country into a failed state where warlords, slavers, people-smugglers, and radical Islamic terrorists thrived, and which\u00a0soured relations with the Obama administration he had worked so hard to ingratiate himself with. A damning report by the House of Commons Home Affairs Committee found that the self-styled \u201cHeir to Blair\u201d was \u201cultimately responsible\u201d for the debacle \u2014 but unlike his New Labour role model there have been few calls for him to be impeached or otherwise sanctioned over the disastrous consequences of his foreign policy. This is perhaps due to the fact that journalists largely withdrew from the country after its disintegration, and because British forces were,\u00a0for the most part, not embroiled in ground operations as they were in Iraq, leading to lesser scrutiny.

You know, everybody\u2019s got their role to play.\u201d White House staff at the time suggested that the former president was particularly frustrated during the campaign. \u201cYou had primarily donors but others, too, who would get fixated by cable and get freaked out and start calling,\u201d former press secretary Robert Gibbs told Politico in 2009.",

      "author": "Haris Alic",
      "content": "Neil Bluhm, a billionaire casino magnate and former Obama bundler, made the comment during a ritzy fundraiser hosted on Biden\u2019s behalf at his Chicago, Illinois home. The former vice president did not correct Bluhm, according to The Chicago Sun Times, choosing instead to deliver a standard stump speech about Americans needing to be more optimistic.  Shortly after Bluhm\u2019s comments broke on social media, the Sanders campaign responded by rebuking the billionaire donor and, in effect, Biden as well. \u201cMr. Bluhm is right \u2014 the Democratic Party I represent is the party of the working class, not billionaires. That\u2019s why we\u2019re going to win,\u201d the Sanders campaign said in a statement.  Bluhm\u2019s criticism and the response it triggered underscores the internal divisions plaguing the Democratic Party ahead of the 2020 presidential election. Biden, despite having one of the most left-wing platforms of any Democrat frontrunner,\u00a0is considered a moderate in comparison to the rest of the field. The image stems from the triangulation Biden has done over the\u00a0span of his more than 40-year political career, especially on issues important to progressives like race, financial deregulation, and criminal justice. The former vice president has also done little to appease the increasingly powerful left-wing of his party by aligning himself with the establishment in opposition to radical proposals like Medicare for All. Even Biden\u2019s attempts to find common ground with progressives on climate change \u2014 by calling for an outright ban on coal \u2014 has been met with\u00a0derision for not going far enough. Sanders and Warren, on the other hand, are seen\u00a0as progressive firebrands pushing the Democratic Party away from the Neoliberal policies of Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama and towards the more centralized economies of Northern Europe. Along those lines, Warren and Sanders have championed a series of policies \u2014 ranging from free higher education, increased Wall Street regulation, and higher taxes on the wealthy, among others \u2014 to remake the American economy. The divergence between the former vice president and Sanders and Warren has been no clearer than on the issue of Medicare for All. Biden has consistently attacked the universal healthcare plan, which is authored by Sanders, as overly ambitious and impossible to implement. The former vice president, who is trumpeting his own healthcare proposal centered on strengthening Obamacare and providing a public health insurance option, has also lambasted the proposal\u2019s backers for not being upfront about its costs and consequences. \u201cBernie\u2019s been very honest about it. He said you\u2019re going to have to raise taxes on the middle class. He said it\u2019s going to end all private insurance. I mean, he\u2019s been straightforward about it. And he\u2019s making his case,\u201d Biden told CNN in July, adding other Democrats have not been as transparent. Sanders, Warren, and their allies have responded to such criticisms by accusing Biden of parroting Republican talking points on Medicare for All. \u201cThe charge that he\u2019s making is exactly what the Republicans are saying,\u201d Sanders told the New York Times in July while excoriating Biden for siding with \u201cinsurance companies and the pharmaceutical industries\u201d on the issue. Many, however, have noted that the battle for Medicare for All is really just a proxy battle between the establishment, which is averse to change, and the grassroots. Biden, himself, seemed to hint at this when he promised at a June fundraiser that \u201cnothing would fundamentally change\u201d if he was elected president.",

      "author": "Haris Alic",
      "content": "The former vice president, who for months has refused to discuss the business dealings of his youngest son, Hunter Biden, has undertaken with foreign governments, accused Trump of misusing his authority while attending the Polk County Steak Fry in Des Moines, Iowa. \u201cThis appears to be an overwhelming abuse of power,\u201d Biden told reporters at the event. \u201cTo get on the phone with a foreign leader who is looking for help from the United States and ask about me and imply things \u2026 this is outrageous.\u201d The former vice president\u2019s comments come one day after the Wall Street Journal reported\u00a0that Trump allegedly asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to look into Hunter Biden\u2019s ties to Burisma Holdings. The younger Biden joined the natural gas company\u2019s board of directors in April 2014, where he was purportedly paid more $83,000 a month, despite having no prior background in the energy industry. At the same time, the then-vice president was the Obama administration\u2019s point-man on Ukraine in the wake of Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea. More troubling is the fact that at the time of\u00a0Hunter Biden\u2019s appointment, Burisma was actively seeking to curry favor with western leaders, especially those in the U.S., after its business practices had come under scrutiny. In April of 2014 \u2014 the same month that Hunter Biden joined Burisma\u2019s board of directors \u2014 the government of Great Britain froze accounts belonging to the company\u2019s founder, Mykola Zlochevsky, under suspicion of money laundering. Zlochevsky, a former Ukraininan minister of natural resources, would later be accused of\u00a0corruption for using his official position\u00a0to issue oil and gas licenses to companies under his control. The controversy surrounding Hunter Biden, Burisma, and Zlochvesky only grew more muddy in 2016 when the then-vice president pressured Ukraine to fire the prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin, overseeing the investigation into the company. Officially, Biden claimed the threat to withhold more than $1 billion in U.S. to Ukraine came from President Barack Obama, who was worried Shokin had lost credibility with western leaders. Regardless of the reasoning, Shokin\u2019s successor closed the investigation into Burisma and Zchlovesky, allowing the oligarch to return to the country after having fled\u00a0in 2014. Biden even bragged about the effectiveness of his threat during an event at the Council of Foreign Relations in 2018. \u201cI looked at them and said, \u2018I\u2019m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you\u2019re not getting the money,'\u201d Biden said. \u201cWell, son of a bitch. He got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time.\u201d The former vice president, however, did not mention the context of his or his son\u2019s dealing with Ukraine while campaigning in Iowa on Saturday. Instead, Biden swiveled between attacking Trump for allegedly asking Ukrainian authorities to investigate the situation to denouncing the media for covering the story. \u201cYou should be looking at Trump,\u201d Biden told reporters when discussing the topic. \u201cEverybody looked at this and everybody who\u2019s looked at it said there\u2019s nothing there. Ask the right question.\u201d As Peter Schweizer, a contributing editor at Breitbart News and the author of a book detailing Hunter Biden\u2019s ties to both China and Ukraine, noted on Friday, the former vice president\u2019s line of attack shows he wants \u201cthe issue to go away.\u201d \u201cThe Bidens are not disputing that he got paid all this money,\u201d Schweizer told Breitbart News Tonight. \u201cThey\u2019re not disputing that Hunter Biden had no background in this area. They just simply want the issue to go away, and what apparently President Trump did was have a conversation with the now-Ukrainian president, saying, \u2018You need to investigate this. I think you need to investigate this,\u2019 and that\u2019s something we\u2019ve been calling for for a long time.\u201d",

The contradicting stories between father and son only underscore the multiple unanswered questions already plaguing the situation. At the center of controversy is how and why Hunter Biden was asked to join the Bursima board of directors in April 2014, despite not having any experience with Ukraine or the energy industry. Even more concerning to ethics watchdogs is the fact that at the same time Hunter Biden was tapped for the $83,000 a month job, his father was the Obama administration\u2019s point man on Ukraine. As Breitbart\u2019s contributing editor Peter Schweizer noted in his book on the scandal, Hunter Biden joined Burisma at time when the company was seen as actively courting western leaders after its business practices came under scrutiny.

Despite the shadowy entanglements that seem suggest a conflict of interest, neither Joe Biden\u00a0nor his son have been willing to address the topic until earlier this week when news broke that Trump had requested Ukrainian authorities to probe the matter. The president defended his decision on Sunday, pointing out there were too many unanswered questions, especially given the Ukraine\u2019s long history of public corruption. \u201cThe conversation I had was largely congratulatory, with largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place and largely the fact that we don\u2019t want our people like Vice President Biden and his son creating the corruption already in the Ukraine and Ukraine has got a lot of problems,\u201d Trump told reporters before departing the White House for Houston, Texas. Trump added that Joe and Hunter Biden had damaged their credibility by contradicting each other. \u201cThis is a very dishonest thing that Joe Biden did, and then he said he never spoke to his son,\u201d the president said. \u201cDoes anybody believe that one?

      "subtitle": "The hefty salary that Hunter Biden, former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s youngest son, drew while serving on the board of directors of a Ukrainian oil and gas giant is raising questions not only about his role with the company, but also if he profited from his father\u2019s political influence.",
      "author": "Haris Alic",
      "content": "The younger Biden, who has a history of getting rich from entities tied to his father, is at the center of controversy after President Donald Trump suggested the Ukrainian government look into his business dealings in the country. Although the former vice president has attempted to paint the issue as an abuse of power on Trump\u2019s part, many have noted the unanswered questions surrounding his son\u2019s tenure at Burisma points to serious conflict of interests, if not outright corruption. The most prominent and perplexing question is how and why Hunter Biden was appointed to the company\u2019s board of directors in the first place. As Peter Schweizer, senior contributor at Breitbart News, detailed in his book, Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends, Hunter Biden had no prior experience with either the energy industry or Ukraine before joining Burisma in April 2014. In fact, his background in\u00a0investment banking, lobbying, and hedge fund management paled in comparison to that of current and past members of the company\u2019s board of directors. At the time of his appointment, ethics watchdogs highlighted the younger Biden\u2019s lack of qualifications but were more concerned about the appearance of a conflict of interest. In particular, many worried Hunter Biden\u2019s ascension to the board of directors, a position that paid at times more than $83,000 per month, was related to his father\u2019s position as the Obama administration\u2019s point man on Ukraine. The poor optics not only raised flags among ethics watchdogs, but also with Hunter Biden\u2019s own business partners.\u00a0Christopher Heinz, the stepson of former Secretary of State John Kerry and co-owner of an investment firm with Hunter Biden in 2014, rushed to play damage control with\u00a0State Department officials at the time of the appointment, according to internal emails obtained by the Washington Examiner. Adding to concerns is the fact that at the time Hunter Biden joined Burisma, the company was seen as actively courting western leaders to prevent further scrutiny of its business practices. The same month Hunter Biden was tapped for the group\u2019s board, the government of Great Britain\u00a0froze\u00a0accounts belonging to Burisma founder, Mykola Zlochevsky, under suspicion of money laundering. Zlochevsky, a former Ukrainian minister of natural resources, would later be accused of\u00a0corruption\u00a0for using his office to approve oil and gas licenses to companies under his control. Joe Biden\u2019s role in the entire matter has only increased suspicions of conflicting interests. As the sitting vice president, Joe Biden led the Obama administration\u2019s response to the Russian invasion of Crimea in 2014. In that role, he pushed billions of dollars in aid to the Ukrainian government, some of which allegedly was filtered to Burisma. More troubling, however, is an episode that took place in 2016, when Joe Biden pressured the Ukrainian government to fire Viktor Shokin, the country\u2019s top prosecutor. Officially, the former vice president has claimed his threat to withhold U.S. aid to Ukraine if Shokin was not fired came from the Obama administration, which had lost confidence in the prosecutor\u2019s abilities to\u00a0root out corruption. Unofficially, though, it was well known that Shokin was investigating both Burisma and Zlochevsky for wrongdoing. Regardless of the reason, Shokin\u2019s successor closed the investigation into Burisma and Zlochevsky, allowing the oligarch to return to the country after having\u00a0fled\u00a0in 2014. The appearance of impropriety on the part of the Bidens has also been underscored by the inability of father and son to get their stories straight. Last week the former vice president claimed to never have discussed his son\u2019s business ties with Ukraine during a campaign appearance in Iowa. \u201cI have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings,\u201d Joe Biden\u00a0angrily said, before pivoting the conversation to Trump\u2019s alleged misuse of power. The former vice president\u2019s claim, though, directly contradicts his son\u2019s on the topic. The younger Biden admitted during a series of candid interviews for a\u00a0New Yorker\u00a0profile published in June that he in fact had discussed his foreign business interests with his father on at least one occasion. \u201cDad said, \u2018I hope you know what you are doing,\u2019 and I said, \u2018I do,\u2019\u201d Hunter Biden\u00a0told\u00a0the magazine. Since making his initial statement in Iowa, Joe Biden has reverted back to his long held position of refusing to discuss his son\u2019s dealings publicly. The silence has left a lot of unanswered questions about Hunter Biden\u2019s role at Burisma. \u201cAgain the question is, what was [Hunter Biden] being paid for?\u201d Schweizer said during a recent appearance on SiriusXM\u2019s Breitbart News Tonight. \u201cThese entities were not giving the money away. They were paying Hunter Biden for something. He\u2019s not selling his expertise, so what exactly was he selling? And that\u2019s what needs to be investigated.\u201d The question is all the more important given Hunter Biden\u2019s history of profiting from his father\u2019s political connections. As Breitbart News reported, the younger Biden scored a job fresh out of law school with his father\u2019s top campaign contributor. In 1996, Hunter Biden was hired for an undisclosed position with MBNA, which at the time was one of the nation\u2019s largest credit card companies. The job raised eyebrows from good government groups as MBNA employees had just donated $63,000 to Joe Biden\u2019s reelection campaign in what appeared to be a\u00a0coordinated\u00a0manner to sidestep federal campaign finance regulations. Hunter Biden would continue working for MBNA in one capacity or another until the mid-2000s, while his father was writing bankruptcy legislation favored by the company.",

      "content": "In a State Department announcement on Thursday, officials said that the annual refugee resettlement ceiling would be lowered from its current 30,000 to 18,000 for Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 \u2014 which runs from October 1, 2019, to September 30, 2020.\u00a0This is merely a numerical limit and not a goal federal officials are supposed to reach. State Department officials said they expect to process more than 350,000 foreign nationals in new asylum cases next year; thus, a reduction in refugee resettlement offsets this historically high humanitarian immigration level. \u201cThe proposed FY 2020 refugee ceiling, as outlined by the president, takes into account our existing and anticipated humanitarian workload on all fronts and fulfills our primary duty to protect and serve U.S. citizens,\u201d Acting Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Ken Cuccinelli said in a statement. The lowering of the refugee resettlement cap to a maximum of 18,000 admissions next year will be at least a 78 to 80 percent decrease of the inflow of refugees that Obama allowed into the country in his last full fiscal year. For example, for FY 2016, Obama\u2019s State Department admitted close to 85,000 refugees into the country. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s State Department is set to admit less than 30,000 refugees this fiscal year, reducing the burden that the refugee resettlement program has placed on America\u2019s working and middle class, as well as on small U.S. communities that have been forced to absorb enormous levels of refugees since 1980. As Breitbart News has reported, the U.S. has permanently resettled more than 1.7 million foreign nationals and refugees through a variety of humanitarian programs \u2014 a foreign population larger than the size of Philadelphia, which has 1.5 million residents. These 1.7 million foreign nationals and refugees do not include the roughly\u00a0445,000 foreign nationals who have been allowed to remain in the U.S. through the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program. Refugee resettlement costs American taxpayers nearly $9 billion every five years, according to the latest research. Over the course of five years, an estimated 16 percent of all refugees admitted will need housing assistance paid for by taxpayers. John Binder is a reporter\u00a0for Breitbart News.

      "content": "McCarthy notes the double standard \u2014 that Democrats want to impeach Trump for doing what Obama did \u2014 and which they have been telling the world for years was necessary to do to protect American national security. As House Intelligence Committee chair Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) told\u00a0NBC News in March, his investigation into Trump dealt with\u00a0\u201ca present threat to our national security \u2014 whether the president and anybody around him are compromised by a foreign power.\u201d If Trump colluded with Russia, or if the Russians had compromising information about him, they could hold enormous influence over the Trump administration \u2014 hence the need for investigation. That is how Democrats defended the decision by intelligence and law enforcement officials under President Obama to conduct surveillance of Trump campaign associates \u2014 without warning Trump himself in a \u201cdefensive\u201d briefing. McCarthy notes that \u201cthe Obama administration\u2019s law-enforcement agencies pressured their Ukrainian counterparts to revive a dormant corruption investigation of Paul Manafort\u201d in the middle of the 2016 presidential election. He cites his recent book,\u00a0Ball of\u00a0Collusion: The Plot to Rig an Election and Destroy a Presidency, recently excerpted on Fox News, which reports that Obama administration officials urged Ukrainian prosecutors to investigate Manafort \u2014 which amounted to \u201ceffectively meddling in the American presidential election.\u201d The results were soon clear: leaks about Manafort\u2019s activities in Ukraine began to appear in the U.S. media, spun in the worst possible light. He was replaced at the Trump campaign and became a target in the phony \u201ccollusion\u201d narrative. McCarthy notes the glaring double standard: \u201cWhen the Obama administration leans on Ukraine for help in an investigation of political opponents, the Democrats and the media say, \u201cBut look how corrupt Paul Manafort was!\u201d When the Trump administration leans on Ukraine for help in an investigation of political opponents, the Democrats and the media say, \u201cAbuse of power \u2014 impeach him!\u201d Two key differences: there is\u00a0actual evidence of former Vice President Joe Biden extorting the Ukrainian government; and Trump has released the transcript of his conversation with the new Ukrainian president.

      "subtitle": "A remarkable story is taking place in Florida and the mainstream media has missed it. It deals with the political recovery of the Cuban-American community in its decades-long struggle to free Cuba from a brutal Communist dictatorship.",
      "author": "Orlando Gutierrez-Boronat",
      "content": "Barely three years ago, it seemed that the Cuban Communist regime had finally outflanked freedom forces within Cuba and in the Cuban-American enclaves in the United States. On December 2014, Ra\u00fal Castro and Barack Obama announced the normalization of diplomatic relations between the United States and Cuba\u2019s Communist Regime. The Obama Administration initiated a unilateral process of political and economic concessions. Serious efforts were made by the administration and Congress to repeal the Cuban Liberty Act, which places democracy and human rights at the top of U.S. relations towards the island. Sadly, even some prominent businessmen in Miami\u2019s Cuban-American community had endorsed these questionable efforts. Media outlets in the U.S. had bought into the narrative of a supposedly reformist Ra\u00fal Castro as a legitimate ruler who was willing to hand over power and unveil a new constitution. The regime\u2019s multiple crimes against humanity and its persistent repression were cast aside as inconvenient. It appeared as if the Cuban resistance had finally been defeated. Today, the Cuban Communist regime, now bereft of its Pharaonic founder and maximum leader, is beset by economic sanctions that have affected its main sources of income and by growing internal unrest, which shows no sign of abating. Cruise tourism from the U.S. to the island has ended, and many whose properties were unlawfully confiscated by the regime are now able to sue third-party exploiters of these properties in U.S. courts. Ra\u00fal Castro and his brood have been designated as gross violators of human rights and sanctioned by the U.S. government as legislatures in at least three Latin American countries are today considering the unprecedented possibility of prosecuting the Castro regime for its crimes against humanity. This initiative has also been supported by the Organization of American States (OAS) and the Centrist International, one of the largest networks of political parties in the world. What happened then? The Castro regime continued to be what it is, and the free Cubans did not give up. In December 2014, the official policy of the United States towards the island was replaced by a confusing and ambiguous economic agenda that relegated the issues of human rights and democracy. The regime never had any interest in taking a substantial step towards the United States. Instead, Cuba\u2019s totalitarian regime targeted and injured U.S. diplomats with what appear to be microwave weapons, deepened and consolidated its control over Venezuela, and intensified its internal repression.\n\nRather than seeing in the U.S. opening a possibility of substantial internal and external transformations of its systems, opening up the island politically and economically to its own citizens, the Castro regime heightened and prolonged political and cultural controls. It found in the U.S. opening an opportunity to prolong its monolithic control of power and not the moment to begin national reconciliation and democratic reconstruction. Aware of the nature of the beast, the Cuban-American community came together in a broad coalition that, from the U.S. Congress to the streets of Miami, mobilized citizens, legislators, and local, national, and international political leaders. Capable Cuban-American legislators prevented the Cuban Liberty Act from being repealed by Congress. The Assembly of the Cuban Resistance, a broad coalition of Cuban American freedom organizations within Cuba and in the United States, persistently mobilized the community. Through petitions, protests, and rallies, the community came together in advocacy of significant sanctions against the Castro dictatorship. In what observers thought was a movement against all odds, committed activists focused on ending cruise tourism to the island and in favor of full implementation of Title III of the Cuban Liberty Act, which permits rightful owners of confiscated properties in the island to sue third party exploiters in U.S. courts. Continued courageous resistance inside Cuba and the plight of political prisoners inspired these efforts. The continuous and diverse public events demonstrated sufficient numbers and intensity that showed that the key Cuban-American core vote was opposed to Obama\u2019s policy towards Cuba. The civic organizations, which make up the core of the community, supported the Bay of Pigs Veteran\u2019s Association in its endorsement of Donald Trump as the candidate with the most coherent policy proposal towards Cuba. The massive vote of the Cuban diaspora for Trump, which was key for his victory in Florida, was in many ways primarily a plebiscite on Obama\u2019s policy towards Cuba. Blinded by ideology, made to order boutique polls and mainstream media spin, most presidential campaigns missed the point in 2016: The cause of Cuba\u2019s freedom will not disappear until it is achieved. It is an intergenerational struggle that has continued unabated for 60 years. The rejection of the Castro regime is deep and resolute for a majority of the Cuban population inside and outside the island. Above all, it is a serious political error to underestimate the level of conviction of the Cuban diaspora. It constitutes an intergenerational commitment imbricated with the community\u2019s very identity. It will neither wither nor dilute while the repressive conditions that caused the separation of thousands of Cuban families from their homeland remain.

      "content": "A new book claims that Obama endorsed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton instead of Biden in 2016 because he was \u201cjust another white guy.\u201d \u201cJoe, despite his many virtues, was just another white guy, one in a long line of American presidents \u2014 hardly the symbol of the Teutonic change that Obama hoped would mark his place in the history books,\u201d wrote author Steven Levingston in a new book, according to the Daily Mail. Levingston is the nonfiction editor of the Washington Post,\u00a0and has authored books about former President John F. Kennedy.

Biden was also stung by the fact that Obama was meeting with potential presidential candidates such as former Rep. Robert Francis \u201cBeto\u201d O\u2019Rourke, according to Livingston. The New York Times also reported in August that Obama told Biden, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this, Joe,\u201d referring to a conversation he had with his former vice president, and asked Biden\u2019s aids to not let the former vice president embarrass himself.

      "author": "Neil Munro",
      "content": "Nationwide, homicides spiked to 15,195 in 2016, up from 12,278 murders in 2014 when Obama and his progressive and media allies began blaming police forces for multiple episodes in which young black men were killed. Since then, Trump has ended the White House support for the Black Lives Matter movement, and the number of murders was forced down to 14,123 in 2018, according to new FBI data.\u00a0The murder rate dropped by 6.8 percent from 2017 to 2018. The combined reduction in murders in 2017 and 2018 adds up to roughly 1,318 Americans who did not die from murder since Obama\u2019s departure in early 2017. The savings amount to approximately two fewer dead each day.\u00a0A large percentage of the people who did not die are African-American. If Obama had kept the murder rate at the 2014 level, 9,304 Americans would not have been murdered from 2015 to 2018. Overall, the violent crime rate fell by 3.3 percent\u00a0from 2017 to 2018, after rising by 4.7 percent from 2014. The violent crime rate is down nine percent from 2009, despite Obama\u2019s crime increase. The FBI data provides details about national arrests\u00a0and city arrests\u00a0by race and ethnic group. But the FBI did not provide easy access to data about the number of white, black, or Latino victims. In late 2017, crime expert Heather McDonald\u00a0blamed\u00a0the extra dead on the Democrats\u2019 \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d campaign to stigmatize and regulate cops. The campaign began when Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder intervened in the 2014\u00a0Ferguson riots, shortly before the 2014 midterm elections. Who is killing these black victims? Not whites, and not the police, but other blacks. In 2016, the police fatally shot 233 blacks, the vast majority armed and dangerous, according to the\u00a0Washington Post. The\u00a0Post\u00a0categorized only 16 black male victims of police shootings as \u201cunarmed\u201d \u2026 The reason for the current increase is what I have called the\u00a0Ferguson Effect. Cops are backing off of proactive policing in high-crime minority neighborhoods, and criminals are becoming emboldened. Having been told incessantly by politicians, the media, and Black Lives Matter activists that they are bigoted for getting out of their cars and questioning someone loitering on a known drug corner at 2\u00a0AM, many officers are instead just driving by. Such stops are discretionary; cops don\u2019t have to make them. And when political elites demonize the police for just such proactive policing, we shouldn\u2019t be surprised when cops get the message and do less of it. Seventy-two percent of the nation\u2019s officers say that they and their colleagues are now less willing to stop and question suspicious persons, according to a Pew Research\u00a0poll\u00a0released in January 2016. The reason is the persistent anti-cop climate. Local police chiefs and former FBI Director James Comey also complained about the political and media pressure on street cops.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know whether that explains it entirely, but I do have a strong sense that some part of the explanation is a chill wind that has blown through American law enforcement over the last year,\u201d James Comey in a 2015\u00a0speech at the University of Chicago Law School. \u201cWe have allowed our Police Department to get fetal, and it is having a direct consequence,\u201d Chicago\u2019s Democratic Mayor, Rahm Emanuel,\u00a0said\u00a0during an October 2015 event.\u00a0\u201cThey have pulled back from the ability to interdict \u2026 they don\u2019t want to be a news story themselves, they don\u2019t want their career ended early, and it\u2019s having an impact,\u201d\u00a0he added. \u201cThe media, academia, and some police officials are again twisting themselves into knots to deny that de-policing is responsible for the ongoing violent-crime increase,\u201d \u00a0McDonald\u00a0reported. She continued: The strong version of what\u00a0I have called the Ferguson Effect\u2014a drop in proactive policing leading to rising crime\u2014is the only explanation for the crime increase that matches the data. The country has just elected a new president who\u00a0understands that the false narrative about the police\u00a0has led to the breakdown of law and order in inner cities. If the crime situation improves in the coming year, it will be because Black Lives Matter calumnies no longer have an echo chamber in the White House and because cops on the beat believe that they will now be supported for trying to restore order where\u00a0informal social control has broken down. Read the FBI data here\u00a0and here.",

      "content": "Members of the Obama administration also reportedly\u00a0retaliated against whistleblowers, namely those linked to the federal government\u2019s gun-walking scandal known as Operation Fast and Furious. Until Obama took power, the government had almost entirely reserved the Espionage Act for spies. Referring to the former president on January 13, 2017, the Washington Times noted, \u201cWhen he entered office in 2009 and waged a war against this community.\u201d Meanwhile, other apparent leaks, made by individuals described by the Guardian as \u201cadministration insiders\u201d in March 2015, went \u201centirely unpunished or\u201d were \u201ctreated, as in\u00a0the case of General David Petraeus, as misdemeanors.\u201d As of late June, President Donald Trump\u2019s administration had indicted three potential whistleblowers under the Espionage Act. At least two of the defendant\u00a0whistleblowers\u00a0pleaded guilty to violating the Espionage Act, the Reporters Without Borders group noted in May. The Obama administration, however, is known for normalizing the use of the statute against journalists\u2019 sources in the government. Even the liberal Washington Post noted early in the Trump administration, \u201cTrump rages about leakers. Obama quietly prosecuted them.\u201d Nevertheless, Democrats have blasted Trump for lambasting intelligence community information leakers that triggered House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry as spies. On Wednesday, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) told reporters that Trump\u2019s attack on the CIA \u201cwhistleblower\u201d that triggered the impeachment investigation is unacceptable. Trump\u2019s comparison of the \u201cwhistleblower\u2019s\u201d source as a \u201cspy\u201d amounts to an \u201cincitement of violence,\u201d Schiff said. In a joint press conference with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), Schiff added that Trump wants to characterize the whistleblower as \u201ctreasonous,\u201d adding: Let\u2019s not make a mistake here, the president wants to make this all about the whistleblower and suggest that people come forward with evidence of his wrongdoing are somehow treasonous and should be treated as traitors and spies. Schiff, who came into office in 2013, has been silent about Obama using the Espionage Act to target whistleblowers. Individuals prosecuted under Obama include U.S. Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning. In May 2017, the government released Manning after serving only seven out of a 35-year sentence for leaking thousands of military and U.S. Department of State documents to WikiLeaks in 2010. Obama also used the Espionage Act to charge Edward Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor, who remains in Russia. Under Obama, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) targeted whistleblowers for leaking information to journalists and even attempted to prosecute the reporters who received and published the data. The Washington Times pointed out: Mr. Obama\u2019s Department of Justice and FBI spied on The Associated Press, secretly wading through their reporters\u2019 phone records, in an effort to chill potential federal whistleblowers. His administration targeted Fox News reporter James Rosen as a criminal co-conspirator under the Espionage Act for simply talking to one of his sources in the State Department and reporting on it. Near the end of his administration, it appeared the former president had a change of heart and showed an interest in protecting government whistleblowers and other official leakers. He implemented executive-branch directives and signed a bill into law to protect whistleblowers and members of the inspector general community.",

Hunter Biden\u2019s reemergence on the campaign coincides with heightened scrutiny over his role at Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian oil and natural gas conglomerate, and if it intersected with his father\u2019s political influence.\u00a0The controversy began when President Donald Trump\u00a0suggested\u00a0the Ukrainian government look into Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings in the country, as there are multiple red flags concerning conflicts of interest. In particular, the most\u00a0prominent and perplexing concern is how and why Hunter Biden secured an appointment to Burisma\u2019s board of directors, a position which purportedly paid as much as\u00a0$83,000 per month, in 2014.\u00a0As Peter Schweizer, senior contributor at Breitbart News, detailed in his\u00a0book,\u00a0Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends, Hunter Biden had no prior experience with either the energy industry or Ukraine before being tapped for the position. The lack of experience, coupled with the fact that Joe Biden at the time had just been made the Obama administration\u2019s point man on Ukraine,\u00a0immediately raised questions from ethics watchdogs in both the U.S. and Europe. Adding to the ethical cloud surrounding the appointment is that at the time of Hunter Biden\u2019s appointment, the company\u2019s founder, Mykola Zlochevsky, had his assets\u00a0seized\u00a0in Great Britain on suspicion of money laundering. Many believe Hunter Biden\u2019s position resulted from an attempt by Zlochevsky to curry favor with western leaders to prevent further scrutiny of his business dealings. Such an attempt would not be all that out of character for Zlochevsky. The Burisma founder is rumored to be one of eastern Europe\u2019s richest oligarchs and was known for cultivating strong\u00a0political ties\u00a0to former Ukrainian President\u00a0Viktor\u00a0Yanukovych \u2014 a staunch ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\u00a0He is also a former Ukrainian minister of natural resources who is widely\u00a0believed\u00a0to have used\u00a0his office to further Burisma\u2019s oil and gas interests. It is in the context of Burisma and Zlochevsky\u2019s legal troubles that Joe Biden\u2019s conflicting interests have drawn the most suspicion. The former vice president has particularly drawn concerns over his conduct in demanding the Ukrainian government fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, in 2016. Biden has officially claimed his demand and the threat to withhold more than one billion in U.S. aid came from then-President Barack Obama, who allegedly had lost faith in Shokin\u2019s ability to root out corruption. Unofficially, though, it was well known that Shokin was investigating both Burisma and Zlochevsky for wrongdoing and public corruption. It is unclear if the probe extended to Hunter Biden, although Shokin has recently admitted that prior to his firing he was told to\u00a0back off\u00a0the matter. Regardless of what exactly occurred, Shokin\u2019s successor closed the investigation into Burisma and Zlochevsky, allowing the oligarch to return to the country after having\u00a0fled\u00a0it in 2014. Since Trump\u2019s suggested the matter be looked into by Ukraine\u2019s newly-elected president, an action that\u00a0launched\u00a0an impeachment inquiry by the Democrat controlled House of Representatives, Biden has worked to minimize his role in the proceeding. To that end, the former vice president has claimed neither nor his son acted inappropriately and an impeachment probe will prove as much. \u201cI\u2019m also confident the American people know me, and they know my son,\u201d the former vice president told the Gazette Journal on Thursday.",

At the same time Iran\u2019s state TV reported Iranian scientist, Reza Dehbashi, who was detained for 13 months in Australia for purchasing a defense system for his country from the United States, had returned home. Dehbashi had been a research student at the University of Queensland. Attorney General Christian Porter confirmed Dehbashi would not be extradited to the United States but refused to comment on speculation of an apparent prisoner swap. \u201cThe Australian government does not comment on the details behind its consideration of particular cases,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cAnd while it is likely that because of Mr Dehbashi Kivi\u2019s nationality some will speculate regarding this matter, consistent with prior practice I do not intend to comment further on the particular details of this case, particularly when any such response from me may diminish our government\u2019s capacity to deal with future matters of this type in Australia\u2019s best interests,\u201d he said. King and Firkin thanked the Australian government and released a statement, saying: \u201cWe are extremely happy and relieved to be safely back in Australia with those we love. While the past few months have been very difficult, we know it has also been tough for those back home who have been worried for us.\u201d The couple requested privacy as they try to \u201cget back to [our] normal lives.\u201d The pair originally left Perth, Western Australia, in June 2017 by off road vehicle bound for the UK, planning to travel for two years driving across 36 countries. They\u00a0have been documenting their travels on Instagram and Youtube with a stated aim of going to countries less likely to fall on the average traveller\u2019s radar due to unsympathetic media coverage. \u201cOur biggest motivation behind making the vlogs is to hopefully inspire anyone wanting to travel, and also try to break the stigma around travelling to countries which get a bad wrap (sic) in the media,\u201d they said\u00a0in a\u00a0post\u00a0on crowd-funding platform Patreon. Deals can be made with Iran for the release of prisoners however this often involves the transfer of large amounts of cash to the Islamic republic. Just such a prisoner exchange was brokered by former U.S. President Barack Obama in January 2016 that freed\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0journalist Jason Rezaian and three other Iranian-Americans. It saw the U.S. make a $1.7 billion cash\u00a0delivery\u00a0to Iran the same day the hostages were allowed to walk free. The Obama administration defended the payment to Iran as a \u201ca very good deal for U.S. taxpayers.\u201d",

Throughout this entire Ukraine Hoax, Schiff has lied to the media, misled the media with selective leaks, over-promised on supposed bombshells \u2014 like what we would learn from the Ukraine call transcript that ended up being a big dud \u2014 and Schiff is right now working in the kind of partisan secrecy that literally reeks of a banana republic. And still\u2026 Our corrupt media do not care. In fact, they are aiding and abetting this fascist secrecy. A legitimate media would be screaming from the rafters for all witness transcripts to be released, not just to them but to the public. A legitimate media that truly believed in \u201cnorms\u201d and \u201cdemocracy\u201d would demand that witnesses testify in public, would demand that the name of the phony whistleblower be released, would demand that a \u00a0process as serious as impeachment be every bit as transparent and public as previous impeachment efforts in the television age \u2014 meaning the impeachment will be televised. How did our media become so corrupt and so un-American that they are facilitating this secret coup attempt, not only with their silence in the face of this unprecedented secrecy, but with propaganda-nonsense about how dangerous it would be for the whistleblower to be identified. We all know why Democrats and the media want the whistleblower to be allowed to hurl rocks and tomatoes from behind a mask\u2026 This removes the right of the accused to question the motives and integrity of his accuser. Imagine if we had never met Julie Swetnick and Christine Blasey Ford, the two liars who accused then-Supreme Court Nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault. Without the opportunity to question them and learn about their histories, the phony charges they leveled probably would have brought Kavanaugh down. That\u2019s what Democrats want to avoid, and no one can blame them. Politics is tough stuff. I get that\u2026 But what we are seeing from the media is a total abdication of every journalistic standard as they defend the secret proceedings behind a presidential coup orchestrated by a man who has made a cottage industry out of lying to the media about having the goods on Trump. Can you imagine Chuck Todd and Jake Tapper, or anyone else who pretends to be a journalist, if some anonymous whistleblower downloaded on Barack Obama and Republicans responded with secret hearings where Democrats were not even allowed to question the accuser? Can you imagine Republicans holding secret impeachment proceedings to take down Obama using secret testimony? The media would literally be on television jumping up and down on their desks demanding transparency. And they would be 100 percent right. But we no longer have a media. All we have is a mob of coup plotters frustrated as hell over the failure of the Russia Collusion Hoax, backed by billions of corporate dollars, and who are willing to do everything in their sinister power to facilitate the removal of a duly elected president in almost total secrecy, willing to be serially lied to by an Adam Schiff, willing to violate every norm that makes our Constitution, our judicial and political system the envy of the world \u2026 just to get Drumpf.

      "author": "Edwin Mora",
      "content": "CNN contributor Clapper served as former U.S. President Barack Obama\u2019s DNI from August 9, 2010, to January 20, 2017, when Donald Trump took office. On Wednesday, the Federalist linked one of the lawyers representing the so-called \u201cwhistleblowers\u201d to Clapper. The revelation came a day after the Washington Examiner reported that the intelligence community (IC) inspector general (IG) told congressional investigators the first \u201cwhistleblower\u201d had a previous \u201cprofessional relationship\u201d with an unnamed 2020 Democrat candidate. News reports have also identified the original \u201cwhistleblower\u201d as a \u201cregistered Democrat.\u201d Moreover, that \u201cwhistleblower\u201d reportedly shared his complaint with the Democrat-led House Intelligence Committee before reaching out to the IC IG, a move that suggests he violated the law. Two \u201cwhistleblowers\u201d have surfaced accusing President Donald Trump of coercing Ukraine into investigating former Vice President Joe Bide and his son, Hunter, by threatening to withhold aid. The first \u201cwhistleblower\u201d is a member of the intelligence community. The same lawyers represent both leakers. Citing the attorney\u2019s biography published by his current employer, the Federalist revealed that the lawyer used to report directly to Clapper, adding: Charles McCullough, an attorney now representing the whistleblowers with Andrew Bakaj, a former staffer for Sens. Chuck Schumer and Hillary Clinton, was previously the inspector general of the intelligence community (ICIG) at the height of the Clinton email scandal. Now a partner at the Compass Rose Legal Group, McCullough\u2019s professional biography on the law firm\u2019s website notes that he reported directly to Clapper as ICIG and \u201coversaw intelligence officers responsible for audits, inspections, investigations.\u201d Clapper, who joined CNN as a national security analyst after leaving government in 2017, was a central figure in perpetuating the Russia hoax against Trump and lied to Congress about mass surveillance on Americans. In an interview with Fox 5 last December, McCullough commended the former DNI, saying, \u201cI enjoyed a very good relationship with Jim Clapper, we got along fabulously.\u201d Clapper is a retired lieutenant general in the U.S. Air Force. The former intelligence community chief\u00a0is one of Trump\u2019s fiercest critics. The \u201cwhistleblowers\u201d claim that Trump threatened to withhold aid from Ukraine if it refused to investigate corruption allegations against Biden, and his son is at the center of the impeachment probe. According to the \u201cwhistleblowers,\u201d Trump made the so-called quid pro quo offer during a July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. However, both Trump and Zelensky have denied the \u201cwhistleblowers\u201d characterization of their conversation. Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, has also said there was not quid pro quo during the call. Michael Atkinson, the IC IG, noted in an August 26 letter that the first \u201cwhistleblower\u201d was found to have harbored \u201cpolitical bias\u201d in favor of a rival political candidate to President Trump. Atkinson did not name the rival.",

      "subtitle": "A California judge is crippling the nation\u2019s immigration enforcement system, amid the myriad examples of murders and crimes committed by illegal migrants, ICE director Matt Albence said at a White House press conference.",
      "author": "Neil Munro",
      "content": "Immigration enforcement is \u201cbeing singled out and marginalized in ways that no other federal law enforcement organization has to tolerate,\u201d he said. \u201cTying our hands from the bench does not make our country any safer.\u201d \u201cWe will continue to put our lives on the line to protect the American public, despite the best efforts of those who like to see no enforcement or open borders,\u201d he said. The judge\u2019s action was prompted by an ACLU lawsuit, which argued that some U.S. citizens were being misidentified as migrants by police databases. The judge announced September 27 he would end ICE\u2019s authority to detain individuals \u2014 including illegals who are arrested and held in state or county jails \u2014 when arrests are based solely on evidence in databases. Once arrested, migrants are not deported until a judge orders their deportation. The California judge is Andr\u00e9 Birotte Jr. He is the son of Haitian immigrants and was nominated by President Barack Obama. His ruling applies just to actions in Southern California, but that is where ICE has one of its major data centers, the\u00a0Pacific Enforcement Response Center, in Laguna Niguel, California. Pro-migration groups rejoiced at their success: The PERC issues detainers 24-hours a day within California and after-hours to 41 other states. The ruling means that ICE may not issue any detainer request from the PERC to any state that does not expressly authorize local law enforcement to make immigration arrests in state law, and it may not issue a detainer without something more than database information to support a probable cause determination.  Albence described the problem: This decision issued by a single judge in Los Angeles will impact at least 43 states, threatening communities far beyond the one in which this judge [sits]. I wish I could say this is an isolated occurrence, it is but the latest example of judicial overreach targeting immigration enforcement and the application of laws already passed by Congress, often decades ago. The Department of Justice may ask the Supreme Court to suspend the judge\u2019s decision. Albence slammed the progressives\u2019 massive resistance to immigration laws: This decision will threaten public safety, as it will lead to the release of criminal aliens back onto the street \u2013 criminals that we won\u2019t find before they hurt. Or worse, more innocent victims that could have been spared their pain and suffering. If only ICE had been allowed to do its job \u2026 Time and again, DHS has been prevented from exercising the authority granted to it by Congress, because of the decisions of unelected judges who substitute their judgment for that of our legislators, or the government officials and trusted with enforcing our laws. \u201cA recent case, in a litany of tragic, tragic examples, clearly illustrates this danger,\u201d Albence said: Carlos Daniel Carillo-Lopez\u00a0entered this country illegally as an unaccompanied alien child in 2015 [from Guatemala].\u00a0He was arrested no less than four times in the past seven months in the state of Washington for charges including criminal trespass, theft, malicious mischief, and failure to appear. Each time ICE lodged a detainer [request to local jails]. Each time the detaining entities \u2014 [which are] proud sanctuary jurisdictions \u2014 release him without notifying ICE [in time for ICE to arrest the illegal].Tragically, on September 30th, 2019, he was arrested for homicide. His victim [was] another young man.  Albence said: ICE made approximately 140,000 arrests this year [and] about 75 percent of those arrests came from working with the jails and prisons. The other 25 percent are made by ICE at-large teams. It is critically important work. But it takes a lot more time and resources to make those arrests and a much greater risk to our officers, the public, and the subjects themselves. And we could have apprehended those criminal aliens from the safe confines of a jail upon their release. Pro-migration groups jeered at Albence\u2019s plea for enforcement of the law. NDLON, a group which represents illegal migrants, declared: The eerie retrograde\u00a0racism on display from the White House podium this morning makes a case for \u2013 rather than against \u2013 sanctuary cities\u2026\u00a0 The Trump Administration is a threat to local public safety.\u00a0 This is a fact.\u00a0\u00a0And no amount of Mexican-bashing, Central American-bashing, or Muslim-bashing will change the truth that recently arrived immigrants \u2013 documented and undocumented \u2013 are now taking the historical baton and defending bedrock constitutional values for everyone. \u201cThe oath of office taken by the men and women of ICE means something to us, which is why we will adapt like we always do, why we will persevere like we always do,\u201d Albence said. He added: We will continue to put our lives on the line to protect the American public despite the best efforts of those who like to see no enforcement or open borders. But make no mistake, rulings from any individual federal court, sitting in a single judicial district purporting to cripple ice authorities on a nationwide basis puts people at risk, innocent victims whose lives will be forever changed for the worse, all across our great country. And we could have stopped it. ",

      "author": "John Nolte",
      "content": "While it\u2019s true that Trump\u2019s approval rating was climbing, and climbed to 45 percent in the Real Clear Politics poll of polls prior to the media and Democrats launching their coordinated impeachment blitzkrieg, as of now it sits at 43.4 percent, not even two points lower. What\u2019s more, Trump disapproval rating has barely increased, from 52 percent to 53.6 percent. And as of late, in fact, Trump\u2019s numbers have actually improved slightly: a half point increase in approval and a half point decrease in disapproval. Overall, what you have here, with such a small amount of movement, is Trump holding remarkably steady during yet-another full-throated media and political assault, the likes of which we have not seen since, you know, the last one. What\u2019s especially fascinating is that during the Russia Collusion Hoax, Democrats and their media allies were able to drive Trump\u2019s numbers down into the 30s, to as low as 37 percent back in December of 2017. This time, even with the hysteria of impeachment added to the menu, not so much. What I think this tells us is the voters are no longer jolted into dropping their support for Trump by a media that has cried wolf nearly once too often four years. In the past, the media could gin up enough hysteria to drive down Trump\u2019s approval numbers, at least until the public figured out it was all fake news. In fact, in the Rasmussen daily tracking poll, the most accurate poll of the 2016 presidential election, shows Trump\u2019s job approval rating has not only climbed from 45 to 49 percent over the last four days, his approval rating is four points higher than Barack Obama\u2019s was on this same day during his failed presidency. Obviously, these numbers can change, but we are now in the second week of Ukraine Hoax Hysteria, so as these numbers stand today, they are worthy of note. One conclusion you might make from them is that time is not on the side of the media and Democrats, is not on this side of this absurd impeachment inquiry. The plan, obviously, was to blitzkrieg the public into backing impeachment, which would force Republicans to go along with public opinion. For days and days and days we were hit 24/7 with screaming headlines and secret testimony that resulted in damaging (and selective) leaks\u2026 There is just no question the media and Democrats thought they had learned from the mistakes of the Russia coup and the plot to destroy Brett Kavanaugh: 1) Move fast, 2) hide your accuser\u2019s (the whistleblower\u2019s) true identity, and 3) do as much as possible in secrecy. Trump, though, outsmarted them by releasing the transcript of his call with the Ukrainian president, which none of his enemies expected him to do because they were sure it was a smoking gun. Well, it wasn\u2019t, but watching the media roll out their game plan as though the president had not released the transcript is more than a little amusing. I mean, now that we\u2019ve seen the transcript, stories, like this, that were obviously written two weeks ago under the assumption Trump would never give up the transcript, actually make me laugh out loud. Trump is also outsmarting the Democrats and the media by refusing to cooperate with what he correctly refers to as a kangaroo court. Good grief, this so-called whistleblower, who we already know is a registered Democrat, who we already know colluded with Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) to create the complaint, who we already know benefited by a sudden Deep State rule change to facilitate his complaint, who we already know is a crony of Joe Biden\u2019s(!!!), wants to testify in secret \u2014 which is the stuff of banana republics. This is not a legitimate inquiry, not even close. Somehow the media and Democrats came up with something that is even more of a partisan witch hunt than the Russia Hoax, and I just don\u2019t see the American people seeing something so toxically partisan and perversely secretive as legitimate. Furthermore, if Democrats actually had the goods on Trump, if the media actually had the goods on the Orange Bad Man, they wouldn\u2019t have to play all these games in secret and spread all these lies. If anything, Trump\u2019s remarkably steady approval rating show us the public is in wait-and-see mode. Democrats might be consolidating their own voters to push up the polls backing impeachment, but the public at large appears to be waiting for the evidence\u2026 And since there is none, Trump is smart to obstruct and delay, smart to treat this coup with the contempt it deserves, because the longer the public is forced to stare at this Potemkin Impeachment, the more they will see it is based on bluff, hysteria, media bias, a desire to meddle in the 2020 election, and stark-raving fear of what the upcoming Inspector General reports are going to say about the Obama administration\u2019s appalling, illegal, and unprecedented spying on Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign.

      "subtitle": "Andrew Bakaj, the attorney representing the so-called whistleblower at the center of the impeachment movement targeting President Donald Trump, previously was a whistleblower witness whose public allegations scuttled the confirmation of the Trump administration\u2019s nominee for CIA inspector general.",
      "author": "Aaron Klein",
      "content": "Bakaj\u2019s original complaint against Trump\u2019s nominee was filed with the office of the Inspector General for the U.S. Intelligence Community. The IG at the time was Chuck McCullough, who is currently working at Bakaj\u2019s three attorney law firm representing the so-called whistleblower. Like Bakaj, the so-called whistleblower against Trump also filed his \u201cDisclosure of Urgent Concern form\u201d with the IG for the intelligence community, albeit with the new IG, Michael Atkinson. Bakaj founded the Compass Rose Legal Group, which is representing the central so-called whistleblower on the matter of Trump\u2019s phone call with the Ukrainian president. Bakaj confirmed that his law firm is also representing \u201cmultiple whistleblowers in connection to the underlying August 12, 2019, disclosure to the Intelligence Community Inspector General.\u201d Bakaj previously interned for Hillary Clinton and did work for other Democrats. At the CIA, Bakaj helped to develop a whistleblower reprisal investigation program. Breitbart News reported that a search of Bakaj\u2019s Twitter account finds rabid anti-Trump posts such as repeated advocacy for Trump cabinet members to invoke the 25th Amendment of the Constitution to remove Trump as president over claimed competency issues. Missing from major news media coverage of Bakaj and his high-profile clients is that he was one of two former CIA employees who went public as whistleblowers to contradict the testimony of Christopher Sharpley, Trump\u2019s CIA IG nominee. As part of the confirmation process, Sharpley testified to Congress in October 2017 that he was unaware of the existence of pending complaints filed against him alleging he and others may have retaliated against CIA workers who lobbed allegations of misconduct at the agency. The exchange came when Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) asked him about published reports of pending complaints against him. \u201cIf there are complaints, if there are investigations out there, I\u2019m unaware of it,\u201d Sharpley replied. The published reports referenced by Feinstein originated with an investigation from the Project On Government Oversight (POGO), which first revealed the allegations against Sharpley just before the Feinstein\u2019s questioning. Feinstein read at length from POGO\u2019s article and even entered the POGO piece into the Congressional Record. The POGO is financed by billionaire George Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundations as well as the Open Society Policy Center. As part of its recommended resources for whistleblowers, POGO promotes the Compass Rose law firm as well as Whistleblower Aid. Sharpley said it was possible he might not know about complaints due to a process that gives confidentiality to government whistleblowers but claimed to have been unaware of the filings. That\u2019s when Bakaj and another ex-CIA employee, Jonathan Kaplan, stepped in and went public by sending letters to the Senate saying that Sharpley was one of the CIA officials listed by name in pending complaints that they both filed in 2014 and 2015. \u00a0Bakaj said that his security clearance had been suspended and that was placed on administrative leave as part of alleged retaliation for an internal CIA complaint alleging wrongdoing. It was also reported that the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s inspector general had asked to interview Sharpley on the pending complaints prior to his testimony leading to some lawmakers questioning his sincerity in denying knowledge of the complaints from Bakaj and Kaplan. CIA spokesman Ryan Trapani told reporters, \u201cMr. Sharpley has had a sterling 5-year career at CIA and there have never been any findings of wrongdoing or misconduct of any sort by Mr. Sharpley during his tenure here.\u201d The complaint from Bakaj alleged a conflict between the CIA\u2019s IG office and the Office of the Intelligence Community Inspector General. Like the current so-called whistleblower against Trump being represented by Bakaj, the attorney\u2019s own complaint involving Sharpley was filed in 2015 as an \u201cUrgent Concern\u201d form with the IG for the Intelligence Community. After his nomination stalled in the Senate over the issue, Sharpley eventually resigned from his position. In the 2017 case against Sharpley during the confirmation process, Bakaj was represented by Mark Zaid, who is senior counsel with the Compass Rose Legal Group where Bakaj now works. Zaid in 2017 co-founded Whistleblower Aid, a small nonprofit that blasted advertisements around D.C. actively seeking whistleblowers during the Trump administration. Kaplan, the other ex-CIA employee who went public against Sharpley, was represented by Whistleblower Aid itself. Whistleblower Aid took public credit for Sharpley\u2019s downfall:  The avalanche of news media reports about the so-called whistleblower clients of Bakaj and Zaid fails to inform the public that at the beginning of Trump\u2019s presidency Zaid co-founded Whistleblower Aid. The group is heavily tied to far-left activist organizations and Democratic politics. In his twitter profile, Zaid describes himself as a \u201cnon-partisan\u201d attorney \u201chandling cases involving national security, security clearances, govt investigations, media, Freedom of Information Act, & whistleblowing.\u201d Zaid\u2019s twitter profile doesn\u2019t mention that he co-founded Whistleblower Aid. That detail is also not mentioned in Zaid\u2019s bio on his attorney website. This even though Whistleblower Aid has been actively helping the first whistleblower also being represented by Zaid by setting up a GoFundMe page seeking to raise funds for the purported whistleblower\u2019s defense. The page already brought in some $210,066 with a goal of raising $300,000. Whistleblower Aid was founded in September 2017 in the wake of Trump\u2019s presidency to encourage government whistleblowers to come forward. The group did not sit around waiting for whistleblowers. Upon its founding, Whistleblower Aid actively sought to attract the attention of Trump administration government employees by reportedly blasting advertisements for its whistleblower services on Metro trains, using mobile billboards that circled government offices for 10 hours a day, and handing out whistles on street corners as a gimmick to gain attention. When Whistleblower Aid was first formed, the main banner for the mission statement of its website contained clearly anti-Trump language. \u201cToday our Republic is under threat. Whistleblower Aid is committed to protecting the rule of law in the United States and around the world,\u201d read the previous statement which can still be viewed via the Internet Archive Wayback Machine. That part of the mission statement received attention in the conservative media. The sentence \u201ctoday our Republic is under threat,\u201d has since been scrubbed from the website.\u00a0 The mission statement now only reads, \u201cWhistleblower Aid is committed to protecting the rule of law in the United States and around the world.\u201d Speaking to the Washington Post just after Whistleblower Aid\u2019s founding, John Tye, who co-founded the organization with Zaid, claimed, \u201cThis is not a partisan effort,\u201d and then went on to express seemingly partisan alarm about Trump. Tye continued, \u201cAt the same time, yes, the rule of law starts with the office of the president. Like many other people, we are definitely concerned about things that are happening in the administration. The decision to fire [FBI Director] James Comey. The lack of transparency. A lot of people have questions about whether this administration respects the rule of law.\u201d Far-left ties, Democrat links Zaid doubles as Executive Director and founder of the James Madison Project, which says it seeks to promote government accountability.\u00a0 The Project features on its four-person advisory board John Podesta, who led Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, served as Chief of Staff to Bill Clinton and founded the Soros-funded Center for American Progress pushing a progressive agenda. Whistleblower Aid co-founder Tye himself is a whistleblower. He is a former State Department official who went public in 2014 about U.S. government electronic surveillance practices. Tye\u2019s bio on Whistleblower Aid\u2019s website brandishes his work for far-left groups. The bio reads: Mr. Tye has worked at the Southern Poverty Law Center, Avaaz, and also Southeast Louisiana Legal Services as a Skadden Fellow. He was on the board of directors of the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana. The Southern Poverty Law Center is known for its anti-conservative stance and controversially publishes a \u201chate map\u201d listing groups that warn about radical Islam such as Jihad Watch, the Clarion Project, the Center for Security Policy. On that same \u201chate map\u201d are racist extremist organizations like Global Crusaders: Order of the Ku Klux Klan and United Klans of America. Tye\u2019s other former employer, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), is financed heavily by billionaire activist and Democratic Party mega-donor George Soros and is known for its hyper-partisan liberal activism. Avaaz, a radical group where Tye served as campaign and legal director, describes itself as a \u201cglobal web movement to bring people-powered politics to decision-making everywhere.\u201d The group has repeatedly engaged in anti-Israel activism. Channeling the mantra of radical community organizer Saul Alinsky, Avaaz says it aims to \u201corganize citizens of all nations to close the gap between the world we have and the world most people everywhere want.\u201d Avaaz was founded in 1997 by the Soros-funded, partisan MoveOn.org organization and by the Soros-funded Res Publica activist group. Tax forms from Soros\u2019s Open Society document donations to Res Publica specifically earmarked for support to Avaaz. Res Publica oversees Avaaz activism. The same year that Whistleblower Aid was founded, Avaaz\u2019s former general counsel and campaign director, Ian Bassin, in 2017 formed United to Protect Democracy. The latter is a grouping of former top lawyers for the Obama administration working to utilize legal advocacy methods to oppose Trump\u2019s policies. Bassin\u2019s United to Protect Democracy works in partnership with the Brennan Center for Justice, located at NYU School of Law. The Brennan Center is heavily financed by Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundations and is the recipient of numerous Open Society grants.

      "content": "During an appearance on Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cJustice\u201d on Saturday, President Donald Trump speculated as to why former President Barack Obama has remained silent as allegations have unfolded regarding wrongdoing by former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden that occurred during his presidency. Trump said he thought Obama was \u201chiding\u201d and raised the possibility that Obama was aware of the efforts from former FBI agents Lisa Page and Peter Strzok to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. Partial transcript as follows: you know, I want to ask a question that I haven\u2019t heard you answer. And that is, where is Barack Obama in all this? Why haven\u2019t we heard from him? I mean, in the beginning of your administration, he wouldn\u2019t stop talking. And now, he\u2019s nowhere to be heard. Where is he? TRUMP: I think he\u2019s hiding. PIRRO: Why? TRUMP: I think he knows all about it. And we are talking about investigate the investigators. We\u2019re talking about the beginning. And it was really before I took office. It was \u2014 if you look at the insurance policy with Strzok and Page, just in case she should lose, we\u2019ve got an insurance policy. That\u2019s what all this stuff has been about, the insurance policy. These are bad people. These are evil people. And this was the insurance policy. The two lovers, Strzok and Page. Two beauties. (LAUGHTER) PIRRO: Well, you know \u2026 TRUMP: And it\u2019s a terrible thing, what they do to this country. Terrible. But we are winning. And we\u2019re winning big. And the American public knows it. And that\u2019s why I think they want to stay away. But they can do whatever they want. But they want to stay away. If you look at what\u2019s happening, Jeanine, if you take a look, the electricity for the Republican Party, they are so angry at what has taken place. Because, as an example, everybody knows that Schiff \u2014 we call him \u201cshifty Schiff\u201d \u2014 he made up the story. He made up my phone call. PIRRO: Right. TRUMP: And based on that phone call, this is what this whole thing is about. It\u2019s all about a phone call. And the call is perfect. I have given that call to everybody to read it. In fact, Lindsey Graham made a statement. He said, I never knew you were so nice. Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor",

      "author": "Haris Alic",
      "content": "The Committee to Defend the President, which is distinguishing itself as one of the top outside spending groups of the 2020 cycle, told\u00a0Breitbart News it is launching a five-figure ad buy on national television and social media highlighting the former vice president\u2019s ethical vulnerabilities\u00a0relating to his son\u2019s business dealings in Ukraine. That ad, which is\u00a0titled \u201cSend Quid Pro Joe Into Retirement,\u201d will air on CNN Tuesday\u2014at the same time the network hosts the fourth Democrat primary debate. \u201cWhen his son\u2019s company was investigated for corruption, Joe Biden used his office to crush the case,\u201d a narrator in the ad states, before showing the former vice president bragging about pressuring the government of Ukraine to fire its prosecutor general. \u201cIt\u2019s time to drain the swamp, send \u2018Quid Pro Joe Biden\u2019 into retirement.\u201d  The ad comes as Hunter Biden\u2019s foreign business dealings have spilled out into the open amid an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump.\u00a0The controversy started last month when Trump\u00a0suggested\u00a0the Ukrainian government look into how the younger Biden secured an appointment to the board of directors of Burisma Holdings. Hunter Biden\u00a0joined the Ukrainian oil and gas giant in 2014, around the same time his father was appointed to oversee Obama administration policy in the region. As Peter Schweizer, senior contributor at Breitbart News, detailed in his book\u00a0Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends, Hunter Biden secured the position, which paid as much as\u00a0$83,000 per month, despite his having no background in the energy industry or Ukraine. Hunter Biden\u2019s lack of experience, coupled with his father\u2019s influence over Ukraine,\u00a0immediately raised questions from ethics watchdogs in both the U.S. and Europe about a conflict of interest. Furthering the ethical cloud over the appointment is that it came during the same month that\u00a0Mykola Zlochevsky, Burisma\u2019s founder,\u00a0had his assets\u00a0seized\u00a0in the United Kingdom for suspicion of money laundering. Some have speculated Hunter Biden\u2019s ascension to Burisma\u2019s board was an attempt by Zlochevsky to curry favor with western leaders to prevent further scrutiny of his business dealings. A brazen attempt would not be totally ill-suited for Zlochevsky. The Burisma founder is rumored to be one of eastern Europe\u2019s top oligarchs, a position obtained while serving in the Ukrainian government under former President\u00a0Viktor\u00a0Yanukovych \u2014 a staunch ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin. It was during his tenure in government as Ukraine\u2019s minister of natural resources that Burisma\u00a0received\u00a0a large portion of its oil and gas licenses. It is in the context of Burisma and Zlochevsky\u2019s legal troubles that Joe Biden\u2019s political influence has raised the most red flags. The former vice president has particularly drawn questions over his conduct in demanding the Ukrainian government fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, in 2016. Biden, who has publicly\u00a0bragged\u00a0about the firing, reportedly threatened to withhold more than one billion dollars in U.S. aid if the Ukrainian government did not remove Shokin. He has claimed the demand came from then-President Barack Obama, who had allegedly lost faith in the prosecutor\u2019s ability to tackle corruption. Unofficially, though, it was known that Shokin was investigating both Burisma and Zlochevsky for public corruption. It is uncertain if the probe extended to Hunter Biden, although Shokin has recently admitted that prior to his ouster he was warned to back off the matter. Regardless of what occurred, Shokin\u2019s successor dropped the investigation into Burisma and Zlochevsky, allowing the oligarch to return to the country after having\u00a0fled\u00a0in 2014. Since Trump suggested Ukraine investigate the matter last month, the former vice president has\u00a0sought to minimize his role in the entire proceeding, especially the firing of Shokin. Part of that strategy has been to pivot the conversation away from Hunter Biden and Burisma by accusing Trump of abusing his power. That tactic, however, does not seem to be working. A new poll released\u00a0this month indicates 57 percent of Americans support the Department of Justice opening an investigation into Hunter Biden\u2019s work abroad. Nor does the situation appear likely to improve any time soon, especially with groups like the Committee to Defend the President pointing out to voters the instances in which politics and business seemed to intersect for Joe Biden and his son.",

      "subtitle": "The Department of Justice is backing President Barack Obama\u2019s award of work permits to roughly 800,000 \u2018DACA\u2019 illegal immigrants.",
      "author": "Neil Munro",
      "content": "The government buried its support for Obama\u2019s DACA work permits on page 15a of the legal brief submitted to the Supreme Court last November by Solicitor General Noel Francisco. The plea says that work permits for DACA migrants are allowed under \u201cSection 1324a\u201d of the federal law. The administration\u2019s August 19, almost final, submission to the court, echoes that claim by ignoring the issue. Some anti-DACA legal pleas are spotlighting the government\u2019s low profile support of the 1324a claim. \u201cThe Government has never said which benefits it does not believe it may lawfully confer [to DACA recipients] \u2026 Nor has the Government explained whether or to what extent it now believes the DHS work-authorization regulation is unlawful,\u201d said a legal brief from several unions. The near silence about DACA work permits shows that government lawyers are ignoring the best argument against Obama\u2019s DACA, said John Miano, a lawyer with the\u00a0Immigration Reform Law Institute. But the work permit issue hides a massive economic landmine: The government awards more than one million work permits each year using the same legal 1324a claim that Obama used in the DACA case. If the court rejects 1324a work-permit claim, investors could lose millions of migrant workers \u2014 and so face even more pressure to raise Americans\u2019 wages. \u201cClearly, the parties do not want to discuss the question of how 1324a conferred on DHS [Department of Homeland Security] unlimited power to grant alien employment,\u201d said Miano. He continued: Both the government and the [pro-DACA] plaintiffs simply claim it is exists \u2026 Few amici [pleas] supporting the [DACA migrants] raised the issue and those that did claimed 1324a created or ratified this unlimited power with no explanation. Apple CEO Tim Cook says DACA illegals are 'as American as any of us.' So Cook & his investor class peers claim the power to rewrite immigration law & create new Americans for work, consumption, and elections.\nBTW, progressives & estb. media are applauding. https://t.co/MIY1uBcwMd \u2014 Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) October 3, 2019  The Obama administration took two steps during the 2012 DACA amnesty. It provided a controversial blanket get-out-0f-deportation card for 800,000 younger migrants \u2014 and it also quietly provided official, legal work permits for those migrants. The Obama administration said the blanket no deportation policy was justified by \u201cprosecutorial discretion.\u201d Obama\u2019s deputies claimed the award of work-permits for foreign migrants was legal because of an obscure corner of federal code, called Section 1324a. Obama\u2019s deputies argued that the first and last paragraphs of Section 1324a say presidents can award as many work permits as they wish: It is unlawful for a person or other\u00a0entity\u00a0to hire, or to recruit or refer for a fee, for employment in the United States an alien knowing the\u00a0alien\u00a0is an unauthorized alien\u00a0(as defined in subsection (h)(3)) \u2026 [which says] As used in this section, the term \u201cunauthorized alien\u201d means, with respect to the employment of an alien at a particular time, that the\u00a0alien\u00a0is not at that time either (A) an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence,\u00a0or (B) authorized to be so employed by this chapter or by the Attorney General. Before Obama, President George W. Bush used the same 1324a claim to justify the \u201cOptional Practical Training\u201d program. The OPT program has been used by Microsoft, Intel, Cisco, and many other companies to hire foreign graduates instead of American graduates. The administration has repeatedly refused to discuss the 1324a claim with Breitbart News. But the DACA case has forced officials to respond. In November 2018, Trump\u2019s Solicitor General wrote in a plea to the court: pre-existing DHS regulations allow all deferred-action recipients to apply for employment authorization, enabling them to work legally and pay taxes. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324a(h)(3) (empowering the Executive Branch to authorize the employment of noncitizens); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 274a.12(c)(14) (providing that \u201c[a]n alien who has been granted deferred action\u201d is eligible for work authorization upon a showing of \u201ceconomic necessity for employment\u201d). Indeed, \u201cDACA recipients are required to apply for employment authorization, in keeping with the Executive\u2019s intention that DACA recipients remain \u2018productive\u2019 members of society.\u201d The administration\u2019s August 19, 2019 plea includes this supporting claim: Under DHS regulations, aliens granted deferred action may receive certain benefits, including work authorization for the same period if they establish economic necessity, 8 C.F.R. 274a.12(c)(14). But a Texas appeals court has already struck down the 1324a work-permit claim when it blocked Obama\u2019s follow-on amnesty \u2014 the 2014 DAPA amnesty for the illegal immigrant parents of U.S.-born children. The Texas court said: For the authority to implement DAPA, the government relies in part on 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324a(h)(3), a provision that does not mention lawful presence or deferred action, and that is listed as a \u201c[m]iscellaneous\u201d definitional provision expressly limited to \u00a7 1324a, a section concerning the \u201cUnlawful employment of aliens\u201d\u2014an exceedingly unlikely place to find authorization for DAPA. If the Supreme Court upholds the Texas court\u2019s rejection of the DACA work permits, it will bar work permits for the DACA illegals and many other foreign workers, said Miano. Immigration reform groups are trying to spotlight the issue, amid media silence. For example, Miano\u2019s Immigration Law Reform Institute submitted a plea saying: if \u00a7 1324a(h)(3) permitted DHS to give work authorization to DACA beneficiaries, it could only be because that provision allowed DHS to authorize work for any class of alien it chose; the provision contains no limiting language. If Congress had granted the\u00a0executive branch such vast discretion, it would have done so clearly, not through \u201cvague terms or ancillary provisions\u2014it does not, one might say, hide elephants in mouseholes.\u201d Whitman v. Am. Trucking Ass\u2019ns, 531 U.S. 457, 468 (2001). It is not reasonable to suppose that Congress, without any clear statement that it was doing so, granted to DHS the unrestricted power to overthrow Congress\u2019s own grants of employment protection to American workers. The 1324a claim is a huge economic issue because it justifies the award of work permits to many foreign migrants, students, and graduates. For example, Bush\u2019s OPT and pre-graduation \u201cCurricular Practical Training\u201d program has ballooned to 430,000 active work permits in 2017. That army includes tens of thousands of foreign graduates who were invited to take jobs at prestigious U.S. firms \u2014 so denying those jobs to the children of the U.S. professional class. The minimal media coverage of the OPT program also helps to hide the OPT fraud, which cheats the sons and daughters of middle-class Americans. GAO warns DHS to do more to prevent the smuggling of Indian and Chinese graduates into U.S. white-collar careers, such as software, healthcare, accounting, etc. Most smuggling takes place via the universities' 'OPT' work-permit giveaway to foreign grads. https://t.co/NSUIVQDO4m \u2014 Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) August 27, 2019  But the OPT program is especially important to universities because it allows them to market their expensive credentials to foreign students with promises of work permit that last up to three years. In 2018,\u00a0143,000 foreign customers of U.S. post-graduate colleges received the work-permits. The OPT program is just one corner of the huge work-permit economy created by the 1324a claim. In 2018, at least 1.97 million\u00a0work permits\u00a0\u2014 mostly lasting one year\u00a0 \u2014 were issued to foreigners, according to data provided by the Department of Homeland Security. The wave of work permits was issued via a diversity of mandatory and discretionary programs, including many programs justified by the 1324a claim. The huge total provides roughly two work permit workers for every four Americans who turned 18 that year. This gusher of foreign workers has sidelined many young and old Americans, suppressed their wages and salaries, and boosted stock-market returns by preventing a bidding war for American employees in a growing economy. The 2018 work permit total includes 328,000 work permits for DACA migrants, 54,000 permits for the wives of Indian H-1B visa-workers, 245,000 work permits for resident foreigners who merely ask for green cards \u2014 dubbed \u201cAdjustment of Status\u201d \u2014\u00a0 and 345,000 permits for migrants who ask for asylum. The work permit total does not include at least 150,000 new visa-workers each year, such as the 100,000 new H-1B workers who joined the existing population of roughly 750,000 H-1B workers. Census data shows how huge numbers of American software graduates have been replaced by Indian & Chinese visa-workers in N.J., California, N.C., Georgia, N.Y., Texas, Virginia, Florida, and other states. Next: Healthcare professionals. @S386 https://t.co/qH9p4Ynd34 \u2014 Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) October 3, 2019  In the 2016 election, Trump denounced the H-1B visa program, which keeps roughly 800,000 foreign graduates in U.S. jobs. But Trump has also repeatedly said he welcomes the movement of foreign graduates into the U.S. economy. On October 11, for example, he told reporters: We\u2019re going to be very good to Chinese students.\u00a0 Nope.\u00a0 I\u2019ve heard this question many times before, including from our own security people.\u00a0 We want all the people that want to come over from China.\u00a0 We have the greatest university system in the world, and we\u2019re going to keep it that way.\u00a0\u00a0 And one of the reasons it\u2019s great is we have a lot of students from China.\u00a0No, we\u2019re not going to make it tough.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to make it like for everybody else.\u00a0 Okay?\u00a0 We\u2019re going to make it \u2014 I think that\u2019s important. \u2026 I want them coming here.\u00a0 We want the greatest talent in the world coming to our great universities \u2014 to Harvard, Yale, Princeton, the great Wharton School of Finance \u2014 to Stanford, all of these great schools.\u00a0 We want them \u2014 we want them coming here.\u00a0 And that\u2019s what we have.\u00a0 And that\u2019s one of the reasons we have the great system.\u00a0And there have been discussing about [stopping] that \u2014 not by me, because I ended them very quickly.\u00a0 I want to let you know, I end those discussions very quickly. Pro-DACA groups try to minimize media coverage of the legality of the 1324a claim. But some of the pro-DACA legal briefs briefly endorse the 1324a claim. The main plaintiff, the University of California, wrote: Beginning with President Eisenhower, every administration has exercised this authority to grant deferred action to groups of otherwise removable immigrants. Congress has expressly recognized that the Executive Branch possesses this authority. It did so knowing that longstanding regulations confer benefits, such as work authorization, on individuals granted deferred action. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324a(h)(3). In 2017, the University of California had more than 40,000 foreign students, and more than 10,200 OPT graduates. The top law officers in California, Maryland, Maine, and Minnesota argued for the preservation of the work-permit claim as they wrote: By regulation, the Attorney General (and now the Secretary) have exercised statutory authority to confer certain limited benefits on individuals who receive deferred action. Petitioners do not question these \u201clongstanding regulations.\u201d \u2026\u00a0 Congress confirmed the Attorney General\u2019s authority to adopt this regulation in the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, which made it unlawful for an employer to hire an \u201cunauthorized alien,\u201d defined as one who is not either a lawful permanent resident or \u201cauthorized to be so employed by [the INA] or by the Attorney General.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324a(h)(3) (emphasis added). The OPT program was created at the request of Microsoft and is widely used by many companies to hire foreign graduates instead of American graduates. In 2017, the company employed roughly 1,000 OPT graduates.\u00a0Lawyers for Microsoft Corp. wrote: the statute prohibiting employment of any \u201cunauthorized alien\u201d defines that term to exclude persons \u201cauthorized to be so employed by [the INA] or by the [DHS Secretary].\u201d 8 U.S.C. 1324a(h)(3) (emphasis added). Since 1987, the Secretary has exercised this authority to permit employers to hire numerous categories of noncitizens\u2014ranging from certain persons with pending asylum applications, to non-immigrant students who face unforeseen economic hardship. New York\u2019s top lawyers argued, \u201cCongress has both recognized the existence of deferred action and confirmed the DHS Secretary\u2019s authority to make deferred action recipients eligible for work authorization, see 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1154 (deferred action); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324a(h)(3) (work authorization).\u201d A group of 165 colleges and universities claimed \u201cwork authorization is not unique to DACA. Rather, it is a product of federal regulations that predate DACA by decades, that have been invoked by administrations of both parties since the 1970s, and that Congress has approved since 1986.\u201d The establishment media have ignored the huge 1324a work-permit issue\u00a0amid favorable coverage of DACA illegals, the \u201cH4EAD\u201d wives of H-1B workers, and the Central American migrants. Donald Trump's OMB again delays promised end of Obama's @H4EAD work permits for 100K spouses of 800K H-1B visa-workers who take jobs from American college grads. Big giveaway to pro-Dem Silicon Valley investors though T. needs more whte-collr votes in 2020 https://t.co/hPqGWtUW1t \u2014 Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) September 18, 2019  \u201cNo-one wants to talk about it,\u201d said Miano. But \u201cif you say DACA is legal, it is legal for any president to wipe out [numerical] protections for American workers in the immigration system.\u201d \u201cIt is astonishing they are defending a provision that has been most abused by the [presidential] Executives \u2026 to get around the [annual] limit on immigration that Congress has created,\u201d said Jessica Vaughan, policy director at the Center for Immigration Studies. \u201cDefending this [claimed 1324a] authority is giving the [White House] executive branch control over the number of foreign workers in our country, and that authority should rest with Congress.\u201d This is amusing: The US biz estb. sign a legal plea to SCOTUS saying the economy shrinks if the 660K DACA workers & consumers go home. But 2 studies cited by biz to justify this obviousness also say Americans' wages go up if the judges strike DACA down. https://t.co/cCXsToIfGh \u2014 Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) October 5, 2019  Immigration Numbers: Each year, roughly four million young\u00a0Americans join the workforce after graduating from high school\u00a0or a university. This total includes about 800,000 Americans who graduate with skilled degrees in business or health care, engineering or science, software, or statistics. But the federal government then imports about 1.1 million legal immigrants and refreshes a resident population of\u00a0about 1.5 million white-collar visa workers \u2014 including approximately one million H-1B workers and spouses \u2014 and about 500,000 blue-collar visa workers.\u00a0The government also prints more than one million work permits for new foreigners and rarely punishes companies for employing illegal migrants. This policy of inflating the labor supply\u00a0boosts\u00a0economic growth and stock values for\u00a0investors. The stimulus happens because the extra labor ensures that employers do not have to compete for American workers by offering higher wages and better working conditions. The federal policy of\u00a0flooding\u00a0the market with cheap, foreign white-collar\u00a0graduates\u00a0and blue-collar\u00a0labor\u00a0shifts wealth from\u00a0young\u00a0employees toward older investors. It also\u00a0widens\u00a0wealth gaps,\u00a0reduces\u00a0high-tech investment,\u00a0increases\u00a0state and local tax burdens, reduces\u00a0marriage\u00a0rates, and hurts children\u2019s schools and\u00a0college\u00a0educations. The cheap-labor economic strategy also\u00a0pushes\u00a0Americans away from high-tech careers, and it sidelines millions of\u00a0marginalized\u00a0Americans, including many who are now\u00a0struggling\u00a0with drug addictions. The labor policy also\u00a0moves\u00a0business investment and wealth from the\u00a0Heartland\u00a0to the\u00a0coastal\u00a0cities,\u00a0explodes\u00a0rents and housing\u00a0costs, undermines suburbia,\u00a0shrivels\u00a0real estate values in the Midwest, and rewards investors for creating low-tech,\u00a0labor-intensive\u00a0workplaces. But President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cHire American\u201d policy is boosting wages by capping immigration within a growing economy. The Census Bureau\u00a0said\u00a0September 10 that men who work full-time and year-round got an average earnings boost of 3.4 percent in 2018, pushing their median salaries up to $55,291. Women gained 3.3 percent in wages, bringing their median salaries to $45,097 for full time, year-round work. GOP Sen. Perdue flops, so Sen. Mike Lee likely gets Senate & GOP vote on Thursday for a huge green-card giveaway to S-Valley investors. Lee's @S386 shows US biz is converting the immigration system to target white-collar salaries & boost US-India trade. https://t.co/zQPRJgObQQ \u2014 Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) September 26, 2019  ",

      "subtitle": "Hunter Biden admitted over the weekend that his father\u2019s political position helped him secure a lucrative appointment to the board of directors of a Ukrainian oil and gas company.",
      "author": "Haris Alic",
      "content": "The younger Biden,\u00a0who has a history of profiting from entities tied to his father, was asked during an interview with ABC News\u2014which is set to air on Tuesday\u2014if he would have been asked to join the board of Burisma Holdings in 2014 had his father not been the sitting vice president. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. Probably not, in retrospect,\u201d Hunter Biden said, before admitting his family\u2019s political prominence played a large role in all of his dealings. \u201cBut that\u2019s\u2014you know\u2014I don\u2019t think that there\u2019s a lot of things that would have happened in my life if my last name wasn\u2019t Biden.\u201d He further added that there is \u201cliterally nothing, as a young man or as a full grown adult\u201d that his \u201cfather in some way hasn\u2019t had influence over.\u201d The interview with ABC News comes as Hunter Biden\u2019s foreign business dealings have spilled out into the open, causing a serious problem for his father\u2019s presidential campaign.\u00a0The controversy started last month when President Donald Trump\u00a0suggested\u00a0the Ukrainian government probe into how the younger Biden secured an appointment to Burisma\u2019s board, shortly after his father was made\u00a0the Obama administration\u2019s point man on Ukraine. As Peter Schweizer, senior contributor at Breitbart News, detailed in his book\u00a0Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends, Hunter Biden secured the position, which paid as much as\u00a0$83,000 per month despite no background in energy or Ukraine.\u00a0In fact, his background in\u00a0investment banking, lobbying, and hedge fund management paled in comparison to that of current and past members of the company\u2019s board of directors. The timing of the appointment not only raised flags among ethics watchdogs, but also with Hunter Biden\u2019s own business partners.\u00a0Christopher Heinz, the stepson of former Secretary of State John Kerry and co-owner of an investment firm with Hunter Biden in 2014, rushed to play damage control with\u00a0State Department officials at the time of the appointment, according to internal emails obtained by the Washington Examiner. Adding to concerns is the fact that at the time Hunter Biden joined Burisma, the company was seen as actively courting western leaders to prevent further scrutiny of its business practices. The same month Hunter Biden was tapped for the group\u2019s board, the government of Great Britain\u00a0froze\u00a0accounts belonging to Burisma founder, Mykola Zlochevsky, under suspicion of money laundering. Zlochevsky, a former Ukrainian minister of natural resources, would later be accused of\u00a0corruption\u00a0for using his office to approve oil and gas licenses to companies under his control. It is in the context of Burisma and Zlochevsky\u2019s legal troubles that Joe Biden\u2019s political influence has raised the most red flags. The former vice president has particularly drawn questions over his conduct in demanding the Ukrainian government fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, in 2016. Joe Biden, who has publicly\u00a0bragged\u00a0about the firing, reportedly threatened to withhold more than one billion dollars in U.S. aid if the Ukrainian government did not remove Shokin. He has claimed the demand came from then-President Barack Obama, who had allegedly lost faith in the prosecutor\u2019s ability to tackle corruption. Unofficially, though, it was known that Shokin was investigating both Burisma and Zlochevsky for public corruption. It is uncertain if the probe extended to Hunter Biden, although Shokin has recently admitted that prior to his ouster he was warned to back off the matter. Regardless of what occurred, Shokin\u2019s successor dropped the investigation into Burisma and Zlochevsky, allowing the oligarch to return to the country after having\u00a0fled\u00a0in 2014. During the interview with ABC over the weekend, Hunter Biden expressed regret over his \u201cpoor judgement\u201d and the appearance of impropriety but maintained that nothing he or his father did was illegal. \u201cIn retrospect, look, I think that it was poor judgment on my part. Is that I think that it was poor judgment because I don\u2019t believe now, when I look back on it\u2014I know that there was\u2014did nothing wrong at all,\u201d the younger Biden said. \u201cHowever, was it poor judgment to be in the middle of something that is \u2026 a swamp in many ways? Yeah.\u201d \u201cDid I make a mistake? Well, maybe in the grand scheme of things, yeah,\u201d he added.\u00a0\u201cBut did I make a mistake based upon some ethical lapse? Absolutely not.\u201d",

      "content": "\u201cWe have an erratic, crazy president who knows not a damn thing about foreign policy and operates out of fear for his own reelection,\u201d Biden said, proceeding to attack President Donald Trump for his decision to pull U.S. troops out of northern Syria. Biden said: It has been the most shameful thing that any president has done in modern history in terms of foreign policy. The fact of the matter is [that]\u00a0I have never seen [such] a time and I\u2019ve spent thousands of hour in the situation, I\u2019ve spent many hours on the ground in those very places in Syria. Despite Biden\u2019s tough rhetoric and his positioning as an expert on international matters, the former vice president has long been castigated by members of the military and national security officials over his foreign policy credentials. In particular, Biden has faced consternation for supporting the Iran Nuclear Agreement, proposing a controversial agenda for partitioning Iraq, and downplaying the threat posed by China. Some of the former vice president\u2019s biggest critics have been Defense Secretaries Robert Gates and James Mattis, two men beloved by the international affairs experts. Gates, who led the Pentagon under both George W. Bush and Barack Obama, asserted during a May interview with CBS\u2019s Face the Nation\u00a0he stood by statements made in his 2014 memoir that Biden had \u201cbeen wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades.\u201d The show\u2019s host, Margaret Brennan, looped Gates\u2019 prior comments into a broader question about whether Biden had the ability to\u00a0\u201cbe an effective commander-in-chief.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Gates said. \u201cI stand by that statement. He and I agreed on some key issues in the Obama administration, we disagreed significantly on Afghanistan and some other issues.\u201d \u201cI think that the vice president has some issues with the military, so how he would get along with the senior military and what that relationship would be,\u201d Gates continued. \u201cI just think it would depend on the personalities at the time.\u201d Mattis, a former general who served as Trump\u2019s first defense secretary, echoed a similar sentiment in his newly released book. Biden \u201cexuded the confidence of a man whose mind was made up, perhaps even indifferent to considering the consequences were he judging the situation incorrectly,\u201d Mattis wrote when discussing the former vice president\u2019s strategy for the Iraq War.",

      "content": "This whole impeachment-in-search-of-a-high-crime charade going on in the House of Representatives today has nothing to do with actually removing President\u00a0Trump\u00a0from office. If that is all Democrats wanted to do, then they would just field a candidate against him whom voters find slightly less detestable than they found Hillary Clinton. That way, when they boot President\u00a0Trump\u00a0from office, they will have voters on their side. And Vice President Mike Pence won\u2019t be left sitting in the Oval Office. So, what is this all about? It is a cover-up, plain and simple. Whom, you ask, are they trying to cover for? Their next political savior who can take down\u00a0Mr. Trump? Certainly not former Vice President Joseph R. Biden. If anything, Mr. Biden has been set ablaze atop the altar as a sacrifice in this massive international cover-up by Democrats. The sleaze and dishonesty and self-dealing that oozes from the Biden name these days will leave a permanent stain on his nearly half-century political career. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know,\u201d said Hunter \u201cThe Leech\u201d Biden, when asked whether he could have gotten a job making $50,000 a month from a Ukrainian gas company if his last name hadn\u2019t been \u201cBiden\u201d at a time when his daddy was vice president of the United States.  \u201cProbably not, in retrospect,\u201d The Leech allowed. \u201cBut that\u2019s \u2014 you know \u2014 I don\u2019t think that there\u2019s been a lot of things that would have happened in my life if my last name wasn\u2019t Biden.\u201d Game. Set. Match. That is all anybody needs to know about the Biden family and whether they were open for bribery in Ukraine or China or anywhere else in the world. The key to understanding House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s coup conspiracy against the president has nothing to do with\u00a0Mr. Trump\u2019s phone call with the president of Ukraine. Instead, it has everything to do with all the fake Russia nonsense they have been barking about for the past three years \u2014 but are suddenly very quiet about today. When was the last time you heard any major Democratic persecutor in Congress utter the word \u201cRussia\u201d? As Sherlock Holmes would say, it is the dog that DIDN\u2019T bark. Which brings us to the \u201cwhom\u201d that Democrats are sacrificing all in an effort to protect: former President Barack Obama. Currently, there are a handful of very, very serious probes by nonpartisan prosecutors bound by rules of fairness and due process looking into the origins of the Obama administration\u2019s spying operation on the campaign of a political opponent at the height of the 2016 election season. This is and always has been the most gravely serious matter in the whole fake Russia \u201ccollusion\u201d saga. People go to jail for doing things like this in America. And it\u2019s not just former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper or ex-CIA Director John Brennan and dirty FBI agents like Peter Strzok who face devastating consequences if it can be proved they used their massive government powers in an effort to destroy a political opponent. It could reach deep into the White House. It could reach the top. This is why Mrs. Pelosi has dropped Russia and collusion and stopped talking about the Mueller report or all the fantasies laid out in the \u201cdirty dossier\u201d that Democrats paid foreign agents to dig up on\u00a0Mr. Trump\u00a0from Russian sources. It is also why Mrs. Pelosi refuses to run the current impeachment \u201cinquiry\u201d with even a hint of due process or fairness. If the minority \u2014 or the executive branch \u2014 were afforded the fairness that attended past impeachments, Republicans would gain subpoena powers to call witnesses. Do you think Republicans might like to question Mr. Brennan or Mr. Clapper under oath about who authorized espionage against political opponents during the height of a presidential campaign? Of course they would. But Mrs. Pelosi will never let them get that close to Mr. Obama. So \u2026 Ukraine! Joe Biden be damned. \u2981\u00a0Contact Charles Hurt at\u00a0churt@washingtontimes.com\u00a0or on Twitter @charleshurt.",

      "content": "\u201cTuesday night\u2019s debate was one more reminder that we are living through the death of the Democratic Party,\u201d Gingrich declares, as we watch it mutate before our eyes into the \u201cDemocratic-Socialist Party.\u201d We are living in \u201ca historic moment in which a once-great American party is transformed into an anti-American engine of radical change,\u201d Gingrich observes. \u201cIn 2020, every Democratic candidate will be faced with the challenge of defending a national party which is now the Democratic-Socialist Party.\u201d In Tuesday\u2019s debate, candidates were falling over each other to establish their far-left creds, leaving behind the platforms of the last two Democrat administrations as a vestige of relative moderation. \u201cImagine that any candidate last night had had the courage (or lack of sense) to actively defend President Bill Clinton\u2019s policies on welfare reform, capital gains tax cuts, balanced federal budgets, or his 1996 State of the Union assertion that \u2018the era of Big Government is over,\u2019\u201d Gingrich muses. The same goes for Barack Obama\u2019s original 2008 position that \u201cI believe marriage is between a man and a woman\u201d or his stated opposition to \u201cany limitation on the right to buy private insurance.\u201d \u201cWhen the last two Democratic presidents are no longer defendable, something profound has happened,\u201d Gingrich observes. Imagine further that one of the candidates had said he or she were against abortion, Gingrich continues. \u201cThe result might have been a riot \u2013 and at a minimum an expulsion of the heretic.\u201d Or imagine if one of the candidates had argued that our schools \u201cshould not be centers of anti-American indoctrination dictated by left-wing unions,\u201d he asserts. \u201cThey would be booed off the stage.\u201d Almost overnight the Old Democratic Party has given way to an almost unrecognizable radical caricature of itself, which is more and more overtly socialist and less and less democratic. \u201cAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez is now the spiritual leader of House Democrats, and every major Democratic presidential candidate has endorsed radical Green New Deal-type proposals that would expand government, destroy the energy industry, radically change America, and plunge the economy into a depression,\u201d Gingrich notes. \u201cThe Democratic-Socialist Party wants to outlaw private health insurance, punish the successful (especially the wealthy), and expand government control over virtually everything,\u201d he says. Their proposals range from \u201cwanting to confiscate guns\u201d to \u201cforcing the radical California gender curriculum in every state\u201d to \u201cremoving the tax exception for every church, synagogue, and mosque that defines marriage as between a man and a woman,\u201d he notes. They also include providing taxpayer-funded health care to people living in the country illegally, open borders, and tax-paid sex-change operations in prison, he adds. The dizzying pace at which the party has been revolutionized calls for thoughtful Americans to pause and ponder the historical significance of what is happening before our eyes, Gingrich suggests. It is \u201ca wrenching, defining moment for the party of FDR and JFK as it is conquered by the party of AOC, Sanders, and Warren,\u201d he concludes. ",

      "subtitle": "Netflix saw disappointing domestic subscriber growth for the third quarter, signaling rougher waters ahead as the streaming giant braces itself for competition from the Walt Disney Company and Apple. This is the second straight quarter in which Netflix has missed its subscriber growth projections.",
      "author": "David Ng",
      "content": "The streaming giant said Wednesday that it signed up 517,000 new subscribers for the quarter ending in September, significantly off from the more than 800,000 that analysts had been expecting. Wall Street investors look to Netflix\u2019s subscriber base as the key metric for the company\u2019s future profitability. As Netflix continues to borrow billions of dollars to finance its growing slate of original programming, it will depend on a growing customer base to eventually pay off that debt. But the Netflix juggernaut is facing stronger headwinds. The streamer shocked Wall Street last quarter when it lost domestic subscribers for the first time in eight years, shedding a whopping 126,000 customers in the U.S. Some subscribers were turned off by higher prices. Netflix announced its highest price hike ever in January, raising the price of its most popular subscription package to $12.99 from $10.99. \u201cSince our U.S. price increase earlier this year, retention has not yet fully returned on a sustained basis to pre-price-change levels, which has led to slower U.S. membership growth,\u201d the company said in an investor note on Wednesday. Consumers will soon have cheaper streaming options at their fingertips. Disney+, which is set to launch next month, will only cost $6.99 a month and will feature movies and TV shows from the combined power of Disney and the recently acquired Fox. Apple TV+ will cost even less at $4.99 a month, and is also set to launch next month, creating more competition for Netflix, which for years has easily dominated the streaming universe. Netflix has also alienated many conservative and right-of-center consumers with its close ties to former President Barack Obama, who signed a production deal with the streamer last year. Susan Rice, Obama\u2019s national security advisor, recently joined Netflix\u2019s board of directors. A survey last year by the research firm YouGov found that\u00a0Netflix\u2019s positive impression rating with Republicans plummeted 16 percent since the beginning of 2018. Meanwhile, the company\u2019s positive impression rating among Democrats rose by 15 percent in the same period. Despite disappointing subscriber results, Netflix shares rose in after-hours trading Wednesday after the company reported quarterly earnings that exceeded guidance. Netflix said that upcoming releases including Martin Scorsese\u2019s acclaimed mob epic\u00a0The Irishman and Noah Baumbach\u2019s intimate drama Marriage Story will help to strengthen its fourth-quarter results.

      "subtitle": "The Obama administration dismissed warnings raised by top State Department official George Kent in 2015 that the Ukrainian company that was employing then-Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter at the time was corrupt, the Washington Post confirmed Thursday.",
      "author": "Edwin Mora",
      "content": "The Post\u2019s report suggested the Obama administration allowed Hunter Biden to continue serving on Burisma Holdings\u2019 board of directors although it knew the company was corrupt. Echoing a report from NBC News issued earlier this week, the Post noted: A career State Department official overseeing Ukraine policy told congressional investigators this week that he had raised concerns in early 2015 about then-Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son serving on the board of a Ukrainian energy company but was turned away by a Biden staffer, according to three people familiar with the testimony. George Kent, a deputy assistant secretary of state, testified Tuesday that he worried that Hunter Biden\u2019s position at the firm Burisma Holdings would complicate efforts by U.S. diplomats to convey to Ukrainian officials the importance of avoiding conflicts of interest, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of confidentiality rules surrounding the deposition. Kent said he had concerns that Ukrainian officials would view Hunter Biden as a conduit for currying influence with his father, said the people. But when Kent raised the issue with Biden\u2019s office, he was told the then-vice president didn\u2019t have the \u201cbandwidth\u201d to deal with the issue involving his son as his other son, Beau, was battling cancer, said the people familiar with his testimony. \u2026 The Washington Post has previously reported that there had been discussions among Biden\u2019s advisers about whether his son\u2019s Ukraine work would be perceived as a conflict of interest, and that one former adviser had been concerned enough to mention it to Biden, though the conversation was brief. Kent\u2019s comments came during his closed-door deposition in the House Democrats\u2019 impeachment probe on Tuesday. When Kent raised his concerns about Burisma, the Obama administration had already cleared Hunter to serve on the company\u2019s board of directors. Hunter joined Burisma\u2019s board of directors in 2014. The former vice president was leading U.S. efforts to crack down on corruption at the time. The State official explicitly warned the Obama administration that Burisma was \u201ccorrupt,\u201d NBC News revealed near the end of its article on Kent\u2019s testimony, noting: During his nearly 10 hours of testimony, Kent also told members of Congress and their staff that Burisma, the energy company where Hunter Biden was a board member, was corrupt, according to a separate person who was present in the room. Kent said he told the Obama administration in 2016 that they should not hold an event with Burisma because of the company\u2019s extensive corruption in Ukraine. In the July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that triggered the impeachment probe, Trump urged his counterpart to investigate corruption allegations against Biden and his son Hunter. As vice president, Biden threatened to withhold aid to Ukraine to force the Eastern European country to fire its top prosecutor in 2016, who had investigated the owner of Burisma, Mykola Zlochevsky, for possible corruption. Hunter had been serving on the board of Burisma for up to $83,000 per month at the time despite having no background in energy, prompting allegations of corruption. He admitted to ABC News last weekend that his father\u2019s political position helped him secure the lucrative appointment to Burisma\u2019s board of directors. A \u201cwhistleblower\u201d allegation that during the July 25 call Trump attempted to pressure Ukraine into investigating the Bidens by withholding aid triggered the impeachment probe. Trump and Ukraine have denied the allegations. The Democrats\u2019 impeachment probe is primarily seeking to determine whether Trump withheld aid to Ukraine in a bid to get dirt on White House hopeful Biden. Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), the leader of the probe, has said, however, that there does not need to be a quid pro quo to impeach Trump.",

      "author": "Edwin Mora",
      "content": "Democrats can impeach Trump even if his Ukraine-related actions are not criminal, Douglas Letter, the lawyer, argued before a federal judge last week. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) handpicked Letter in January to serve as the general counsel for the Democrat-led House of Representatives. Since then, he has been at the center of strategizing the House Democrats\u2019 impeachment fight against the president, CNN reported Thursday. Letter does not talk to the press. CNN, however, quoted him as telling a federal judge last week that the impeachment probe may extend beyond Ukraine. \u201cI can\u2019t emphasize enough: It\u2019s not just Ukraine. If it\u2019s criminal, but even if it\u2019s not \u2014 President Trump can clearly be impeached if he was obstructing justice,\u201d the lawyer reportedly said. CNN added: Letter also said that even simply lying to the American public could prompt impeachment. In the court proceeding, Letter was fighting on behalf of House Democrats to obtain the FBI memos from interviews with key White House witnesses that\u00a0Robert Mueller conducted\u00a0as part of his two-year probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and whether anyone from President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign was involved. The lawyer, who reportedly spent four decades at the U.S. Department of Justice, is reportedly working on behalf of House Democrats with a team of nine attorneys. The impeachment probe is supposed to focus on determining whether Trump abused his power as president by withholding aid to Ukraine in a bid to get dirt on Joe Biden. A \u201cwhistleblower\u2019s\u201d allegation that Trump made a quid pro quo offer to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during a call on July 25 triggered the impeachment probe. The \u201cwhistleblower\u201d claimed Trump demanded Zelensky\u2019s cooperation in investigating Biden and his son Hunter in exchange for aid. Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), the leader of the probe, has also said, however, that there does not need to be a Ukraine-linked quid pro quo to impeach Trump. House Democrats have accused President Trump of obstruction of justice for refusing to cooperate with their impeachment probe, particularly for not relinquishing documents. Former President Barack Obama refused to cooperate with congressional investigators seeking information on his administration\u2019s fatal gun-running operation known as Fast and Furious. Nevertheless, neither Republicans nor Democrats sought to impeach him for it. Under Fast and Furious, the Obama administration allowed criminals in Mexico to buy hundreds of guns. Some of the weapons were used to kill U.S. Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry. They were also used to kill or wound an estimated 300 Mexicans. In 2012, some Democrats joined their Republican colleagues in\u00a0voting\u00a0in favor of holding then-Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress for refusing to cooperate with their investigation into the fatal operation. The courts, not the threat of impeachment, forced the administration to hand over tens of thousands of pages, but the subpoena fight for documents did not end until after Obama\u2019s presidency ended.",

      "content": "The Daily Mail says Obama, wearing a black suit with dark sunglasses, was seen entering the\u00a0Greenwich hotel ahead of his dinner with\u00a0De Niro. The pair is said to have dined at\u00a0Yves Restaurant in\u00a0Tribeca. Robert De Niro has longed supported Obama, having campaigned for him in 2008. As the Daily Mail notes, the dinner comes after Barack and Michelle Obama\u2019s production company,\u00a0Higher Ground,\u00a0 signed a whopping $90 million deal to produce a\u00a0Netflix\u00a0series regarding calls to impeachment President\u00a0Donald Trump.\u00a0De Niro has long urged House Democrats to begin proceedings to remove the president, contending he \u201cshould not be president, period.\u201d In addition to their Netflix deal, the Obamas production company is teaming up with Spotify to produce exclusive podcasts for the platform. Under the partnership announced, the former president and first lady will develop and lend their voices to select podcasts. \u201cWe\u2019ve always believed in the value of entertaining, thought-provoking conversation. It helps us build connections with each other and open ourselves up to new ideas,\u201d a statement via former\u00a0President Obama\u00a0read at the time. \u201cWe\u2019re excited about Higher Ground Audio because podcasts offer an extraordinary opportunity to foster productive dialogue, make people smile and make people think, and, hopefully, bring us all a little closer together.\u201d The Obamas launched Higher Ground in 2018 with an initial partnership with Netflix. The idea was to raise new, diverse voices in the entertainment industry. The Spotify partnership seeks to expand the conversation. The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

      "author": "Robert Kraychik",
      "content": "Under James Comey\u2019s former directorship of the FBI, the federal government surveilled Trump\u2019s political associates as early as 2015, ostensibly as a \u201ccounterintelligence\u201d operation on alleged Russian \u201cinterference\u201d in 2016\u2019s presidential election. In May, Attorney General William Barr appointed U.S. attorney John Durham to head the aforementioned investigation of the Obama administration\u2019s surveillance of Trump\u2019s campaign, including the use of surveillance warrants via the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), Von Spakovsky said, \u201cIf these CIA analysts were providing false information or false and fraudulent assessments in order to get a counterintelligence operation started against the president, then boy, they\u2019d better get lawyers, because they not only engaged in an abuse of their authority, but they probably broke federal law in what they were doing.\u201d LISTEN:  \u201cWe know there\u2019s a problem in the intelligence agencies,\u201d said von Spakovsky of political and partisan functionaries within the intelligence agencies. \u201cAll you have to do is look at the ridiculous whistleblower complaint filed by the non-whistleblower against the president in a phone call in the Ukraine to understand that there is a lot of bias inside of our intelligence agencies, which does not give one a great deal of confidence in the accuracy and credibility of the work they\u2019re supposed to be doing, which is analyzing the national security threats to the United States.\u201d Von Spakovsky contrasted Durham\u2019s investigation with a forthcoming report from the Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz regarding\u00a0possible abuses of power by the FBI in its obtainment of a surveillance warrant on former Trump campaign official Carter Page. \u201cThe inspector general only has the power to report on any wrongdoing, fraud, [or] abuse that he finds,\u201d von Spakovsky stated. \u201cAn inspector general can make a recommendation at the end of the report [that] the Justice Department prosecute someone, but he has no power to do it. John Durham, on the other hand, as a U.S. attorney, can also issue a report just like the IG did, but if he finds criminal wrongdoing, he can impanel a grand jury and criminally prosecute anyone that he believes may have broken the law.\u201d Von Spakovsky added, \u201cEveryone should remember it is against the law for the CIA to operate domestically, and if they were engaging in domestic operations to spy on American citizens, including people working inside the Trump campaign, then they did break federal law and they are in a lot of trouble, or they should be in a lot of trouble.\u201d \u201cIf [the CIA] discovers foreign espionage going on inside the United States, they have to turn that over to the FBI,\u201d continued von Spakosvky. \u201cThe FBI has a huge counterintelligence division whose only job it is to stop foreign espionage going on inside the United States. The CIA cannot do that. Their task is to operate abroad and to gather intelligence for the United States. Counterintelligence [is] the FBI\u2019s responsibility.\u201d Von Spakovsky went on, \u201cIf the CIA handed over false information or information they had not checked and verified to the FBI, then the CIA people are potentially in trouble, as would be the FBI if they then did not verify or check the information they were getting from the CIA. We know they didn\u2019t do that when it came to the Steele dossier. The FBI didn\u2019t check any of that information.\u201d \u201cI think \u2026 maybe folks in the intelligence agencies [are] very scared and very worried about the investigation that John Durham is doing, and hoping that this distracts the public and distracts Congress,\u201d estimated von Spakovsky. Comey has mocked concernsabout the FBI\u2019s surveillance of Trump\u2019s campaign as \u201cconspiracy theories.\u201d He also denied that the FBI \u2014 under his directorship \u2014 \u201cspied on the Trump campaign\u201d or engaged in \u201ccorruption.\u201d Breitbart News Tonight broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot channel 125 weeknights from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern or 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Pacific.

      "subtitle": "The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), a London-based NGO tracking abuses in the country, published a video Tuesday showing jihadis allied with Turkey shouting \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d and kicking around the dead body of a Kurdish woman fighting the Turkish invasion.",
      "author": "Frances Martel",
      "content": "In the video, reproduced by the Kurdish outlet Rudaw, a man apparently holding a cell phone films himself celebrating over the bodies of several Kurdish \u201cpigs\u201d and introduced the body of the woman by shouting \u201cthis is one of your prostitutes you sent us.\u201d Several others join him in circling the woman\u2019s body, apparently kicked around and bloodied, and shouting \u201cAllahu akbar,\u201d the common jihadi battle cry that roughly translates to \u201cAllah is superior.\u201d \u201cThe corpses of PKK (Kurdistan Worker\u2019s Party) and PYD (Democratic Union Party) pigs under the feet of the Mujahideen of Faylaq (Corps) al-Majd,\u201d the jihadist says in the video. The PKK is a U.S.-designated Marxist terrorist organization; the PYD is the civilian political Kurdish party running Syrian Kurdistan, or Rojava. The female fighter is believed to have been a member of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), an umbrella coalition of mostly-Kurdish forces allied with the United States before President Donald Trump withdrew U.S. forces from the region this month. The SDF includes members of the Kurdish People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG) and Women\u2019s Protection Units (YPJ). The YPG includes soldiers of both sexes; the YPJ is an all-female unit. [Warning: graphic images]  The man filming the video reportedly identifies himself and his peers as members of the\u00a0\u201cMujahideen of Faylaq al-Majd,\u201d a jihadist group now allied with Turkey. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan launched an invasion of Syria named \u201cOperation Peace Spring\u201d this month aimed at eradicating the indigenous Kurdish presence of northern Syria (Rojava) and replacing it with mostly Arab refugees currently in Turkey. Erdogan openly stated that Turkish soldiers would fight alongside the Free Syrian Army (FSA), a coalition of mostly Sunni fighters created during the height of the Syrian Civil War to take down dictator Bashar al-Assad. The FSA includes several jihadist elements, including the\u00a0al-Mahdy fighters seen in the video. The SOHR did not offer a definitive date for when the video was taken, only that the events recorded occurred amid the \u201cOperation Peace Spring\u201d invasion. Rudaw sites the Kurdish Hawar news agency as dating the woman\u2019s death to Tuesday and the location of the video to be somewhere outside Kobani, a Syrian-Kurdish border town that Erdogan had agreed to leave untouched in his invasion. Rudaw reported Wednesday that other videos of jihadist desecrating the bodies of women fighting on the front lines have surfaced from \u201cOperation Peace Spring.\u201d In another video obtained by Rudaw, another YPJ fighter seems to have been captured in Tuesday\u2019s attack by the 3rd Corps of the Faylaq al-Majd, by the Ahrar Dar Ta\u2019azah battalions. \u201cI took this female pig prisoner!\u201d a fighter is heard saying, as they surround a confused female, with indistinct shouts of \u201cbeautiful\u201d being heard in the background. It is not clear if they are referring to the captured YPJ fighter. Rudaw also highlighted the killing, confirmed by the SDF this week, of Hevrin Khalaf, a woman\u2019s rights advocate and\u00a0Secretary General of the Future Syria Party, a party active in Rojava. \u201cShe was taken out of her car during a Turkish-backed attack and executed by Turkish backed mercenary factions on the International Road between Qamishlo and Manbij, where her driver who was also martyred,\u201d the Syrian Democratic Council, the civilian organization tied to the SDF,\u00a0said in a statement in which it accused the Turkish government of targeting and killing \u201cunarmed civilians.\u201d \u201cProfessor Hevrin Khalaf, was the Secretary General of the Future Syria Party, a party with a political orientation towards Syria in general, is far from military agendas, equally approaches all Syrian parties since the past one and a half years to establish a pluralistic society that Syria lacked;\u201d the SDF said. Kurds in both Syria and Iraq have long accepted women among their rank and file soldiers and have sent the YPJ to the front lines. Kurdish women were particularly effective fighters against the Islamic State at the height of its \u201ccaliphate\u201d in 2014-2016, as ISIS jihadis feared that being killed by a woman would deny them the full rewards of martyrdom in Heaven. \u201cThey are so scared of us! If we kill them they can\u2019t go to heaven,\u201d\u00a0Haveen, a 22-year-old YPJ fighter, told\u00a0the\u00a0Independent\u00a0in 2016. \u201cWe make loud calls of happiness when we see them to let them know we are coming. That\u2019s when they become cowards.\u201d The YPJ have for years been among the most effective anti-jihadist militias on the ground in Syria. Erdogan, an avowed Islamist, is seeking to destroy the YPJ and its co-ed fellow Kurdish militia, the YPG, because he claims they are indistinguishable from the PKK. The Syrian Kurdish fighters have not publicly disavowed the largely Turkish-Kurdish PKK, but have also not openly aided any terrorist PKK activity within Turkish borders, focusing primarily on fighting ISIS. Erdogan\u2019s government has, in contrast, done little to prevent ISIS sympathizers from entering the Syrian fray through the Turkish border. \u201cTurkey has been hosting ISIS for years,\u201d Can D\u00fcndar, a Turkish journalist forced into exile in Germany for exposing Erdogan\u2019s ties to jihadist militias in Syria, said this week. \u201cEveryone knows it in the region.\u201d The Free Syrian Army responsible for the video posted by the SOHR was a U.S. ally under President Barack Obama. According to Obama\u2019s former special envoy against ISIS, Brett McGurk, the Obama administration \u201cinvested significant amounts of time, significant American resources, to build a force that was known as the Free Syrian Army.\u201d Follow Frances Martel on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0and\u00a0Twitter.",

      "subtitle": "Acting U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor, who provided key testimony to the Democrats\u2019 controversial impeachment inquiry yesterday, has evidenced a close relationship with the Atlantic Council think tank, even writing Ukraine policy pieces with the organization\u2019s director and analysis articles published by the Council.",
      "author": "Aaron Klein",
      "content": "The Atlantic Council is funded by and works in partnership with Burisma, the natural gas company at the center of allegations regarding Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden. In addition to a direct relationship with the Atlantic Council, Taylor for the last nine years also served as a senior adviser to the U.S.-Ukraine Business Council (USUBC), which has co-hosted events with the Atlantic Council and has participated in events co-hosted jointly by the Atlantic Council and Burisma. Another senior adviser to the USUBC is David J. Kramer, a long-time adviser to late Senator John McCain. Kramer played a central role in disseminating the anti-Trump dossier to the news media and Obama administration. Taylor participated in events and initiatives organized by Kramer. The links may be particularly instructive after Breitbart News reported that itinerary for a trip to Ukraine in August organized by the Burisma-funded Atlantic Council for ten Congressional aides reveals that a staffer on Rep. Adam Schiff\u2019s House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence held a meeting during the trip with Taylor.\u00a0 The pre-planned trip took place after the so-called whistleblower officially filed his August 12 complaint and reportedly after a Schiff aide was contacted by the so-called whistleblower. Multiple U.S. media outlets yesterday obtained Taylor\u2019s full opening statement to the House Intelligence, Oversight and Foreign Affairs committees. In the leaked pre-written full opening statement, Taylor alluded to work he said he did for a \u201csmall Ukrainian non- governmental organization\u201d but he omitted the name of the organization. \u201cIn the intervening 10 years, I have stayed engaged with Ukraine, visiting frequently since 2013 as a board member of a small Ukrainian non- governmental organization supporting good governance and reform,\u201d he said. The name of the organization is the U.S.-Ukraine Business Council (USUBC), where Taylor served for nine years as senior advisor. The USUBC has co-hosted or participated in scores of events with the Atlantic Council. Taylor has also authored numerous analysis pieces published by the Atlantic Council itself and has co-authored opeds written together with the Atlantic Council\u2019s director. Burisma is a key financial backer of the Atlantic Council. In 2017, Burisma and the Atlantic Council signed a cooperative agreement to develop transatlantic programs with Burisma\u2019s financial support reportedly to focus \u201con European and international energy security.\u201d Burisma specifically finances the Atlantic Council\u2019s Eurasia Center. Besides funding the Atlantic Council, Burisma also routinely partners with the think tank. Only four months ago, the company co-hosted the Atlantic Council\u2019s second Annual Kharkiv Security Conference. \u00a0Burisma advertises that it committed itself to \u201c15 key principles of rule of law and economic policy in Ukraine developed by the Atlantic Council.\u201d In March, three months before he became Trump\u2019s ambassador to Ukraine, the Atlantic Council featured an oped co-authored by Taylor in which the diplomat argued Ukraine \u201chas further to travel toward its self-proclaimed European goal\u201d of reformation. In 2017, Taylor wrote a piece for the Atlantic Council about a Ukrainian parliament vote on health care reform. Last year, he participated in an online Atlantic Council Q & A on the Crimea. In November 2011, the Atlantic Council hosted Taylor as the featured speaker at a discussion event when he was appointed that year as Special Coordinator for Middle East Transitions at the State Department. In March 2014, Taylor co-authored an analysis piece at Foreign Policy magazine written together with John E. Herbst, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine who serves as director of the Eurasia Center for the Atlantic council \u2013 the same Eurasia Center that is specifically funded by Burisma. That same year, Taylor also co-authored a New York Times op-ed with the Atlantic Council\u2019s Herbst on Ukraine. The duo co-authored another Times op-ed one year later on the future of Ukraine.\u00a0 The op-ed was reprinted on the USUBC\u2019s website. The USUBC, where Taylor was a senior adviser for nine years along with Kramer, has hosted Herbst for briefings and other events. Kramer of the USUBC, infamous for his role in disseminating the anti-Trump dossier, also held a November 2011 event at the Atlantic Council\u2019s D.C. offices for a group that he heads called Freedom House. \u00a0Taylor was one of six featured speakers at Kramer\u2019s event. The Atlantic Council published what it deemed a 24-point plan for ending the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. In conjunction with the plan, Kramer, in his role as director of Freedom House, organized a letter by American and European experts and former officials urging Russia to end its conflict with Ukraine. Signatories of the letter, published on the Burisma-funded Atlantic Council\u2019s website, include Taylor, Kramer and the Atlantic Council\u2019s Herbst. As late as this past March, Taylor was listed as one of nine members of the Friends of Ukraine Network Economic Security Task Force. Another member is Kramer. When he deployed to Ukraine as Trump\u2019s ambassador in June, the USUBC authored a piece in the Kyiv Post welcoming him In the USUBC piece welcoming Taylor to Ukraine, Kramer himself commented about Taylor\u2019s ambassador position. \u201cHe\u2019s a great choice for now,\u201d Kramer gushed. The USUBC\u2019s piece noted that the \u201cUSUBC has worked closely with Ambassador Taylor for many years,\u201d touting his role as the business group\u2019s\u00a0senior adviser. On June 26, just nine days after arriving in Ukraine as ambassador, the USUBC already hosted Taylor for a roundtable discussion about his new position. Vadym Pozharskyi, adviser to the board of directors at Burisma Holdings, was also previously hosted as a USUBC featured speaker. Geysha Gonzalez is the sponsoring Atlantic Council officer listed on the Congressional disclosure form for the Schiff staffer\u2019s trip to Ukraine in August. She is deputy director of the Atlantic Council\u2019s Eurasia Center. Gonzalez is also one of eleven members of the rapid response team for the Ukrainian Election Task Force, which says it is working to expose \u201cforeign interference in Ukraine\u2019s democracy.\u201d Another member of the team is Kramer. Kramer revealed in testimony that he held a meeting about the anti-Trump dossier with a reporter from BuzzFeed News, who he says snapped photos of the controversial document without Kramer\u2019s permission when he left the room to go to the bathroom. That meeting was held at the McCain Institute office in Washington, Kramer stated. BuzzFeed infamously published the Christopher Steele dossier on January 10, 2017, setting off a firestorm of news media coverage about the document. The\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0reported last February that Kramer received the dossier directly from Fusion GPS after McCain expressed interest in it. In a deposition taken on December 13, 2017, and posted online earlier this year, Kramer revealed that he met with two Obama administration officials to inquire about whether the anti-Trump dossier was being taken seriously. In one case, Kramer said that he personally provided a copy of the dossier to Obama National Security Council official Celeste Wallander. In the deposition, Kramer said that McCain specifically asked him in early December 2016 to meet about the dossier with Wallander and Victoria Nuland, a senior official in John Kerry\u2019s State Department. Taylor testimony and Burisma In his testimony to the Democrats secretive impeachment inquiry yesterday, Taylor said that he \u201cunderstood\u201d from U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland that a White House meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky \u201cwas dependent on a public announcement of the investigations.\u201d Taylor was referring to the announcement of an investigation that included Burisma, as well as alleged Ukrainian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Taylor\u2019s testimony was characterized by CNN as \u201cexplosive\u201d and was similarly hyped by other news media outlets despite it not being unusual for the U.S. to condition aspects of relations on participation in ongoing American investigations involving the foreign country in question. Still, Taylor conceded that there was no quid pro quo. \u201cAmbassador Sondland said that he had talked to President Zelensky and Mr. Yermak and told them that, although this was not a quid pro quo, if President Zelensky did not \u2018clear things up\u2019 in public, we could be at a \u2018stalemate.\u2019 I understood \u2018stalemate to mean that Ukraine would not receive the much-needed military assistance,\u201d Taylor testified. Document: Adam Schiff Staffer Met with Impeachment Witness on Ukraine Trip As Breitbart News reported, Thomas Eager, a staffer on Schiff\u2019s House Intelligence Committee, took a trip to Ukraine in August billed as a bipartisan \u201cUkraine Study Trip\u201d in which ten Congressional staffers participated. Eager is also currently a fellow at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Eurasia Congressional Fellowship, a bipartisan program that says it \u201ceducates congressional staff on current events in the Eurasia region.\u201d The pre-planned Ukraine trip was part of the fellowship program. A closer look at the itinerary for the August 24 to August 31 trip shows that the delegation\u2019s first meeting upon arrival in Ukraine was with Taylor. Spokespeople for Schiff\u2019s office did not reply to multiple Breitbart News requests for comment on Eager\u2019s meeting with Taylor. When Breitbart News first reported on Eager\u2019s visit to Ukraine, Schiff\u2019s office quickly replied to several comment requests, denying any impropriety related to Eager\u2019s association with the Atlantic Council or the trip. The unanswered Breitbart email requests to Schiff\u2019s office about Taylor\u2019s meeting with Eager posed the following question: While in Ukraine, did Mr. Eager speak to Mr. Taylor about the issue of reports about any representatives of President Trump looking into alleged Biden corruption in Ukraine? The dates of the pre-planned trip are instructive. Eager\u2019s visit to Ukraine sponsored by the Burisma-funded Atlantic Council began 12 days after the so-called whistleblower officially filed his August 12 complaint. Schiff and his office have offered seemingly conflicting statements on the timeline of the California Congressman\u2019s initial contact with the so-called whistleblower. Speaking on September 17, Schiff told MSNBC, \u201cWe have not spoken directly with the whistleblower. We would like to.\u201d Schiff\u2019s spokesperson, Patrick Boland, was quoted on October 2 saying, \u201cAt no point did the committee review or receive the complaint in advance.\u201d Boland said Schiff\u2019s committee received the complaint the night before it publicly released the document. On October 2, however, the New York Times reported that Schiff received some of the contents of the complaint through an unnamed House Intelligence Committee aide initially contacted by the so-called whistleblower, described as a CIA officer. The Times reported the aide \u201cshared some of what the officer conveyed to Mr. Schiff.\u201d \u00a0The referenced officer refers to the so-called whistleblower. The newspaper also reported: By the time the whistle-blower filed his complaint, Mr. Schiff and his staff knew at least vaguely what it contained. Speaking to CBS\u2019s Face the Nation on Sunday, Schiff conceded that he was not clear enough about his contact with the so-called whistleblower. \u201cI should have been much more clear,\u201d Schiff said. Schiff signed form Schiff\u2019s signature appears on the required post-travel disclosure form filed with the House Committee on Ethics documenting the visit to Ukraine. The form signed by Schiff says that Eager\u2019s trip to Ukraine was paid for by the \u201cAtlantic Council\u2019s Eurasia Center.\u201d  The form bearing Schiff\u2019s signature (above) describes the visit thusly: Series of meetings and visits with gov\u2019t officials, party officials, civil society and private sector reps in Ukraine to learn about ongoing political and military issues, including conflict in the East. The costs for Eager\u2019s visit listed on the form are $2202.91 for transportation, $985.50 for lodging, and $630.15 for meal expenses. Speaking to Breitbart News, Gonzalez confirmed that Eager started his one-year fellowship with the organization in January and that Eager is still a fellow. Gonzalez said the pre-planned trip was part of the fellowship program, which also includes a full year of round tables and other educational events. She said it was not within her portfolio to comment on issues of funding from Burisma or other donors. Common funding themes Besides Burisma funding, the Atlantic Council is also financed by billionaire activist George Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundations, Google, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, Inc., and the U.S. State Department. Google, Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundations, the Rockefeller Fund, and an agency of the State Department each also finance a self-described investigative journalism organization repeatedly referenced as a source of information in the so-called whistleblower\u2019s complaint alleging Trump was \u201cusing the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country\u201d in the 2020 presidential race. The charges in the July 22 report referenced in the so-called whistleblower\u2019s document and released by the Google and Soros-funded organization, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), seem to be the public precursors for a lot of the so-called whistleblower\u2019s own claims, as Breitbart News documented. One key section of the so-called whistleblower\u2019s document claims that \u201cmultiple U.S. officials told me that Mr. Giuliani had reportedly privately reached out to a variety of other Zelensky advisers, including Chief of Staff Andriy Bohdan and Acting Chairman of the Security Service of Ukraine Ivan Bakanov.\u201d This was allegedly to follow up on Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky in order to discuss the \u201ccases\u201d mentioned in that call, according to the so-called whistleblower\u2019s narrative. The complainer was clearly referencing Trump\u2019s request for Ukraine to investigate the Biden corruption allegations. Even though the statement was written in first person \u2013 \u201cmultiple U.S. officials told me\u201d \u2013 it contains a footnote referencing a report by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP). That footnote reads: In a report published by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) on 22 July, two associates of Mr. Giuliani reportedly traveled to Kyiv in May 2019 and met with Mr. Bakanov and another close Zelensky adviser, Mr. Serhiy Shefir. The so-called whistleblower\u2019s account goes on to rely upon that same OCCRP report on three more occasions. It does so to: The OCCRP report repeatedly referenced is actually a \u201cjoint investigation by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) and BuzzFeed News, based on interviews and court and business records in the United States and Ukraine.\u201d BuzzFeed infamously also first published the full anti-Trump dossier alleging unsubstantiated collusion between Trump\u2019s presidential campaign and Russia. The dossier was paid for by Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign and the Democratic National Committee, and was produced by the Fusion GPS opposition dirt outfit. The OCCRP and BuzzFeed \u201cjoint investigation\u201d resulted in both OCCRP and BuzzFeed publishing similar lengthy pieces on July 22 claiming that Giuliani was attempting to use connections to have Ukraine investigate Trump\u2019s political rivals. The so-called whistleblower\u2019s document, however, only mentions the largely unknown OCCRP and does not reference BuzzFeed, which has faced scrutiny over its reporting on the Russia collusion claims.

Trump touted surging U.S. natural gas and crude oil output and his efforts to roll back regulations on energy industries as underpinning his administration\u2019s intention to pull the United States from the 2015 international climate agreement. \u201cThe Paris accord would have been shutting down American producers with excessive regulatory restrictions like you would not believe, while allowing foreign producers to pollute with impunity,\u201d said Trump, who shared the stage with dozens of workers wearing hard hats. \u201cWhat we won\u2019t do is punish the American people while enriching foreign polluters,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cI\u2019m proud to say it, it\u2019s called America First.\u201d U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during the 9th Shale Insight Conference at the David L. Lawrence Convention Center on October 23, 2019, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. ( BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty Images) The first day he can officially start the process has not yet arrived. According to the terms of the agreement, Trump can submit a letter on Nov. 4 to the United Nations to start the clock to withdraw the United States formally from global climate pact. Withdrawing takes one year, which would mean the United States would leave the agreement one day after the Nov. 3, 2020, presidential election. As Breitbart News reported, as far back as June, 2017 Trump said he was looking forward to exiting the agreement. The president spoke then of following through on his commitments to the American people. \u201cIn order to fulfill my solemn duty to protect America and its citizens, the United States will withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord,\u201d Trump declared. Compliance with the accord could have cost the U.S. \u201cas much as 2.7 million lost jobs by 2025 according to the National Economic Research Associates,\u201d said Trump. \u201cThis includes 440,000 fewer manufacturing jobs \u2014 not what we need\u2026\u201d Leaving the Paris climate agreement was a key part of Trump\u2019s message as he campaigned for the presidency in 2016. Former President Barack Obama\u00a0unofficially entered\u00a0the United States into the accord, which was adopted in December 2015 as the United Nations Climate Change Conference came to a close.",

      "author": "Neil Munro",
      "content": "\u201cWe are especially concerned that the Department has yet to intervene in this matter where a mother is using alleged medical professionals to fundamentally alter her son\u2019s physiology,\u201d said Jeffrey Mateer, the first assistant Attorney General. He continued: The children at the center of this dispute are in immediate and irrevocable danger. We ask that you open an investigation this matter as soon as possible and act pursuant to your emergency powers to protect the boy in question [from] permanent and potentially irreversible harm by his mother. The letter spotlighted the broader childcare problems raised by the claim that children can be converted into members of the opposite sex by medical interventions such as pills, hormones, and surgery. The letter says: We have been made aware that last year, during an earlier hearing in the case \u2014 which was attended by a [state] Department caseworker \u2014 the mother admitted multiple times under oath that she intends to transition the boy to a girl. The mother also intends to administer puberty blocking drugs to the child and start that process as early as next year. The social worker that the mother is using to transition the child, who operates Dallas Rainbow Counseling, wrote a letter recommending that the child to be admitted to a \u201cclinic\u201d at Dallas Children\u2019s Hospital that will facilitate the child\u2019s transition. One of the counselors who testified for the mother admitted that there is virtually no peer-reviewed research on the transitioning of a child from one gender to another.\u00a0But the mother refuses to get any second opinions from other doctors or counselors recommended by the father.\u00a0The end goal of the mother is to affirm her seven-year-old boy\u2019s gender dysphoria by socially transitioning him to a girl now, and administer puberty blocking drugs in a year so that he subsequently can undergo hormone therapy and explore surgery to physically and permanently alter his body. An increasing number of children are facing this medical \u201ctransition\u201d ordeal.\u00a0But there are a growing number of reports about the biological and mental harms of the treatment, and an increasing number of adults who \u201cdetransition\u201d by rejecting the claim that they can solve their problems by changing their sex. The AG\u2019s request is likely to be followed, even though a divorce judge gave the father veto power over the mother\u2019s sex change plans after the letter was sent. Any investigation of the state\u2019s \u201ctransgender\u201d industry is likely to face furious opposition from the clinics and drug companies that claim the ability to change people into members of the opposite sex.  Transgender Facts In general, the transgender ideology says a person\u2019s legal and civic recognition as a man or a woman must be determined by their \u201cgender identity,\u201d not by their biology. The ideology also insists that men and women are more or less interchangeable, and it objects to the public\u2019s view of the two sexes as simultaneously different, complementary, and equal. The transgender advocates want to impose their ideology on Americans by establishing \u201ctransgender rights\u201d laws, which would require the Department of Justice to penalize individuals and groups who insist that biology determines each person\u2019s male-or-female status \u2014 and also shapes peoples\u2019 likely political, civic, and personal priorities. Polls show the transgender ideology is deeply\u00a0unpopular, especially among\u00a0women and\u00a0parents. In 2017, former President Barack Obama told NPR that his promotion of the transgender ideology made it easier for Donald Trump to win the presidency. Multiple\u00a0polls\u00a0show that most Americans reasonably\u00a0wish\u00a0to help and comfort people\u00a0who think they are a member of the opposite sex, even as they also\u00a0reject\u00a0the transgender ideology\u2019s claim\u00a0that people\u2019s legal sex is determined by their feeling of \u201cgender identity,\u201d not by biology. A U.K. survey\u00a0shows\u00a0a similar mix of sympathy for people who say they are transgender alongside lopsided opposition to the ideology. The transgender movement is diverse, so its different factions have competing goals and priorities. It includes sexual liberationists,\u00a0progressives, feminists who wish to\u00a0blur\u00a0distinctions\u00a0between the two sexes, and people who glamorize the\u00a0differences\u00a0between the two sexes. It includes high-profile\u00a0children, people who are\u00a0trying\u00a0to live as members of the opposite sex, troubled teenage girls trying to\u00a0flee\u00a0womanhood, and people trying to \u201cdetransition\u201d\u00a0back\u00a0to their biological sex. It also includes men who\u00a0demand\u00a0sex from\u00a0lesbians, masculine\u00a0autogynephiles\u00a0who say they are entitled to women\u2019s rights,\u00a0alpha males\u00a0who insist they are the natural leaders of women,\u00a0parents\u00a0eager\u00a0to support their children\u2019s\u2019 transgender claims, wealthy\u00a0donors,\u00a0politicians, political\u00a0professionals,\u00a0revenue-seeking drug companies,\u00a0surgeons, and medical service\u00a0providers. Transgender advocates claim that two million Americans say they are transgender to a greater or lesser extent. But very few\u00a0people\u00a0who describe themselves as transgender undergo cosmetic surgery of the genitals. Only about 4,118\u00a0Americans\u00a0surgically altered their bodies in hospitals from 2000 to 2014 to appear like members of the opposite sex, according to a pro-transgender medical study.\u00a0A Pentagon\u00a0report\u00a0commissioned by former Defense Secretary James Mattis said that \u201crates for genital surgery are exceedingly low- 2% of transgender men and 10% of transgender women.\u201d The progressive push to bend Americans\u2019 attitudes and their male-and-female civic society around the idea of \u201cgender identity\u201d has already attacked and cracked many popular social rules. Those rules help Americans manage cooperation and competition among and between complementary, different, and equal men and women. These pro-gender claims have an impact on different-sex bathrooms,\u00a0shelters\u00a0for battered women,\u00a0sports\u00a0leagues for girls,\u00a0hiking\u00a0groups for boys,\u00a0K-12\u00a0curricula, university speech\u00a0codes,\u00a0religious\u00a0freedoms, free\u00a0speech, the social status of\u00a0women, parents\u2019\u00a0rights\u00a0in childrearing, children\u2019s\u00a0safety, practices to help\u00a0 teenagers,\u00a0 health outcomes, women\u2019s\u00a0ideals of\u00a0beauty, culture and civil\u00a0society, scientific\u00a0research, prison\u00a0safety, civic\u00a0ceremonies, school\u00a0rules, men\u2019s\u00a0sense\u00a0of masculinity, law\u00a0enforcement, military\u00a0culture, and children\u2019s sexual\u00a0privacy.

      "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
      "content": " Trump\u2019s full statement emphasized the need to put country ahead of party as the nation celebrated, as follows: I want to personally congratulate President Obama and the men [and] women of the Armed Forces for a job very well done. I am so proud to see Americans standing shoulder to shoulder, waving the American flag in celebration of this great victory. We should spend the next several days not debating party politics, but in remembrance of those who lost their lives on 9/11 and those fighting for our freedom. God Bless America. Moreover, Trump congratulated Obama even though the president had infamously mocked him mercilessly just hours before the raid, at the 2011 White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner (WHCD). Obama said\u00a0on that occasion: And I know just the guy to do it -\u2013 Donald Trump is here tonight!\u00a0 (Laughter and applause.)\u00a0 Now, I know that he\u2019s taken some flak lately, but no one is happier, no one is prouder to put this birth certificate matter to rest than the Donald.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 And that\u2019s because he can finally get back to focusing on the issues that matter \u2013- like, did we fake the moon landing?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 What really happened in Roswell?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 And where are Biggie and Tupac?\u00a0 (Laughter and applause.) But all kidding aside, obviously, we all know about your credentials and breadth of experience.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 For example \u2014 no, seriously, just recently, in an episode of Celebrity Apprentice \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 at the steakhouse, the men\u2019s cooking team cooking did not impress the judges from Omaha Steaks.\u00a0 And there was a lot of blame to go around.\u00a0 But you, Mr. Trump, recognized that the real problem was a lack of leadership.\u00a0 And so ultimately, you didn\u2019t blame Lil\u2019 Jon or Meatloaf.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 You fired Gary Busey.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 And these are the kind of decisions that would keep me up at night.\u00a0 (Laughter and applause.)\u00a0 Well handled, sir.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Well handled. Say what you will about Mr. Trump, he certainly would bring some change to the White House.\u00a0 Let\u2019s see what we\u2019ve got up there.\u00a0 (Laughter.) (Screens show \u201cTrump White House Resort and Casino.\u201d) Other Republicans were generous to Obama, too, putting patriotism ahead of politics. As the\u00a0New York Times noted: WASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama drew praise from unlikely quarters on Monday for pursuing a risky and clandestine mission to kill Osama bin Laden, a successful operation that interrupted the withering Republican criticism about his foreign policy, world view and his grasp of the office. Former Vice President Dick Cheney declared, \u201cThe administration clearly deserves credit for the success of the operation.\u201d New York\u2019s former mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, said, \u201cI admire the courage of the president.\u201d And Donald J. Trump declared, \u201cI want to personally congratulate President Obama.\u201d The\u00a0Times observed that Republicans praised Obama even though it was clear the raid would help him politically. Later in 2011 and 2012, Trump walked back his praise for Obama somewhat:   As of Sunday morning, former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), and former HUD Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro had congratulated U.S. forces while pointedly excluding President Trump from their congratulations. Joel B.

      "author": "Haris Alic",
      "content": "\u201cI congratulate our special forces, our intelligence community, and all our brave military professionals on delivering justice to the terrorist Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi,\u201d the former vice president said shortly after the White House announced it had successfully killed the ISIS leader during an overnight raid in Syria. \u201cIt is thanks to their courage and relentless determination to carry out their mission that ISIS has suffered a vital loss.\u201d Biden, in his short statement, followed the trend of other presidential candidates, such as Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-VT) and former Housing Secretary Julian Castro, by not once mentioning Trump. The snub came despite the fact that Trump gave the order to go after al-Baghdadi, who led ISIS since 2014 and was responsible for most of the group\u2019s terrorist activities in the past few years.  The president confirmed on Sunday that al-Baghdadi was killed during a daring nighttime raid on a compound in northwestern Syria\u2019s Idlib Provence. The raid, which was led by a group of U.S. special forces, killed a \u201clarge number\u201d of ISIS forces, culminating in al-Baghdadi being cornered in a tunnel beneath the compound. Instead of being captured by the approaching U.S. forces, the ISIS leader detonated a suicide vest killing himself and three children. \u201cHe died like a dog, he died like a coward,\u201d Trump said when announcing the news. \u201cThe world is now a much safer place.\u201d No U.S. troops were wounded in the operation, according to the president, except for \u201ca beautiful\u201d and \u201ctalented dog\u201d that was part of the canine unit brought along for the mission. Biden, in his own statement on Sunday seemed to agree\u00a0with the president, even if he refused to mention him by name, when he said the \u201cworld is better and safer without\u201d al-Baghdadi. Biden\u2019s reluctance to congratulate the president for successfully taking out the ISIS leader stands in stark contrast to a\u00a0message Trump sent to then-President Barack Obama upon the death of Osama bin Laden in May 2011.

The former Obama White House aide is\u00a0looking to take 76-year-old Jos\u00e9 E. Serrano\u2019s (D-NY) seat for the 15th district of New York in 2020.

      "subtitle": "The parents of murdered American humanitarian worker Kayla Mueller gave media interviews on\u00a0Sunday and Monday in which they thanked President Donald Trump and the U.S. military for tracking down and killing Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi \u2013 the man who enslaved, raped, and killed their daughter.",
      "author": "John Hayward",
      "content": "The Muellers, who have long been critical of how the Obama administration handled Kayla\u2019s captivity from 2013 to 2015, praised Trump for being more \u201cdecisive\u201d than former President Barack Obama. \u201cWhat this man did to Kayla \u2013 he kidnapped her,\u201d an emotional Carl Mueller told the Arizona Republic. \u201cShe was held in many prisons. She was held in solitary confinement.\u201d \u201cShe was tortured. She was intimidated. She was ultimately raped by al-Baghdadi himself. He either killed her or he was complicit in her murder,\u201d Carl said, stressing a point somehow overlooked by certain media organizations. \u201cI\u2019ll let people who read this article make up their own mind how a parent should feel,\u201d Carl concluded. His wife Marsha lamented that not all of the details of Kayla\u2019s death have been revealed, including the precise circumstances of her death. The Islamic State claimed she was killed when Jordanian airstrikes on the ISIS \u201ccapital\u201d of Raqqa collapsed the building she was held prisoner in, but the Jordanians and U.S. military officials disputed that account, and few would be willing to absolve ISIS and Baghdadi of full responsibility for Kayla\u2019s death even if it was true. \u201cI still want to know, \u2018Where is Kayla?\u2019 and what truly happened to her and what aren\u2019t we being told. Someone knows, and I\u2019m praying with all my heart that someone in this world will bring us those answers,\u201d Marsha Mueller said. \u201cWe are so grateful for them,\u201d she said of the American troops who carried out the Baghdadi raid and President Trump for giving the order. The Muellers expressed gratitude that no American soldiers were killed in the operation. \u201cI still say Kayla should be here, and if Obama had been as decisive as President Trump, maybe she would have been,\u201d Marsha added. \u201cHe knows her story. He\u2019s been briefed on it, and he knows, and that\u2019s important to me. I don\u2019t think anything would have stopped him from getting this guy,\u201d Carl said of Trump, expressing confidence that the U.S. military is \u201cgoing to get them all.\u201d The Muellers were optimistic that the Trump administration would discover and reveal more details of Kayla\u2019s captivity and murder. \u201cI think this administration truly might help us. I don\u2019t think they are as closed about what happened,\u201d said Marsha. The Muellers expressed similar sentiments in other interviews on Sunday and Monday. Carl Mueller told the local CBS News affiliate on Monday it was a \u201cshock\u201d to learn of Baghdadi\u2019s confirmed death at last after years of false reports about the elusive ISIS leader\u2019s fate. \u201cOne minute you\u2019re sitting here watching a movie, and the next minute you get the news the man that raped and possibly murdered your daughter has been killed,\u201d he said. Marsha noted to CBS that Kayla\u2019s remains have never been recovered, so she cannot help nursing the faintest hope that her daughter might still be alive and lost in Syria. In any event, she said the Mueller family hopes to bring Kayla home. \u201cBecause of that one percent possibility, how do you completely give up until you have her home? We want Kayla home, and I know that sounds like an impossible task, but after what we\u2019ve been through, the things that pop up and happen I believe we might just find her,\u201d she said. \u201cWe feel this is the moment,\u201d Carl said. \u201c[Baghdadi\u2019s] been killed, some of his lieutenants have been captured, and who else would know what happened to Kayla but these people close to him? Somebody, and it may be one of these people who were captured yesterday, knows what happened and know who killed her.\u201d Marsha Mueller told CNN on Sunday she and her husband were \u201cdeeply touched\u201d by President Trump\u2019s statement on Sunday, which mentioned Kayla Mueller by name. \u201cWe were grateful that they didn\u2019t mess around and went right in,\u201d she said. \u201cI just want to say how grateful we are to this administration, to the military, and to the special forces that went in. My hope is that this will help us get answers to what really happened to Kayla and get her home,\u201d she said. Carl told ABC News on Sunday it was \u201cvery touching\u201d to learn the operation that took Baghdadi down was named after Kayla. \u201cPresident Trump mentioned her today in his statement and he mentioned that he deserved what he got for what he did to Kayla,\u201d Carl said. \u201cShe\u2019s not forgotten, and that\u2019s important.\u201d The Muellers revealed during the ABC interview they once traveled to Iraq and met with Umm Sayyaf, the imprisoned wife of Islamic State financier Abu Sayyaf, killed by U.S. special forces in 2015. \u201cWhen we talked to Umm Sayyaf, we found we got more information out of her, not just us, the people backing us \u2013 they got information from her that neither the Kurds or the US government had got in the two days that we were there,\u201d Carl said of the trip to Iraq. \u201cWe learned from women that were ransomed out by their governments that she said she was held in many cold, dark places, she was raped by al-Baghdadi, we know that to be a fact. She was murdered by him or someone in his organization. That\u2019s what we\u2019re pursuing and that\u2019s what we hope that President Trump will help us with,\u201d he said.",

      "content": "A partial transcript is as follows: MARGARET BRENNAN: What is your reaction to the death of\u00a0al-Baghdadi? SUSAN RICE: Obviously, it\u2019s a major milestone and it\u2019s one we all should be welcoming quite plainly, but it doesn\u2019t mean that the fight against ISIS is over. And it doesn\u2019t mean that we can declare mission accomplished and just walk away. What we\u2019ve seen time and time again in this part of the world is that when the pressure is relieved on terrorist organizations, whether al-Qaeda\u00a0or ISIS, they are able to reconstitute. So we need to be vigilant. We need to maintain a minimal presence in order to ensure that the pressure stays on ISIS and they don\u2019t come back roaring. MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0Was President Obama informed of the death of al-Baghdadi by the administration? Did you know before the news today? RICE: No, there\u2019s no reason why I should know. There is a tradition of common courtesy of presidents informing their predecessors of things of significance like this. Since the White House seemingly didn\u2019t feel it necessary to inform the leadership of the intelligence committees on a bipartisan basis, I\u2019m quite confident that they didn\u2019t do the normal protocol with respect to predecessors either.",

      "content": "Whereas, Trump congratulated former President Obama\u00a0after he announced the raid that resulted in the death of Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in 2011. The president announced the death of\u00a0al-Baghdadi on Sunday, praising U.S. Special Operations forces, who \u201caccomplished their mission in grand style.\u201d \u201cThe thug who tried so hard to intimidate others spent his last moments in utter fear, in total panic and dread \u2014 terrified of the American forces bearing down on him,\u201d Trump said, detailing the moment the terrorist ignited his suicide vest after finding himself entrapped by U.S. forces. While 2020 candidates reacted to the news, many omitted any mention of the president\u2019s role, despite the fact that \u2013 as Trump noted \u2013 \u201ccapturing or killing Baghdadi has been the top national security priority\u201d of his administration. \u201cI congratulate our special forces, our intelligence community, and all our brave military professionals on delivering justice to the terrorist Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The world is better and safer without him in it,\u201d former Vice President Joe Biden (D) wrote, omitting any mention of Trump:  \u201cAbu Bakr al-Baghdadi led a campaign of mass violence and terror that devastated the region and threatened the world. His death is a setback for ISIS and a victory for justice,\u201d Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) wrote. \u201cI am grateful for the skill and courage of our special operations and intelligence professionals,\u201d she continued, noting that his death is \u201cnot the end of our fight against terrorism\u201d:  \u201cThe removal of al-Baghdadi from the battlefield is a credit to our armed forces & intelligence community who have committed years of service in the fight against ISIS & violent extremism,\u201d Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CO) wrote. \u201cWe\u2019re grateful to them, the Kurds & other allies & partners as we continue the fight ahead,\u201d he added:  Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), in his initial response, thanked the \u201cKurds and other U.S. allies\u201d but failed to mention Trump or U.S. troops:  \u201cISIS has caused immeasurable suffering & destruction; the death of Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi was an important, much needed action to defeat it,\u201d Marianne Williamson (D) said. \u201cPraise and thanks for the military bravery and brilliance that carried out the mission\u201d:  \u201cAl-Baghdadi was a dangerous terrorist who committed heinous crimes. As I said this morning, getting rid of him was good for America and the world. But as I discussed today on @FaceTheNation many challenges remain,\u201d Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) wrote:  \u201cA ruthless murderer has been brought to justice. I\u2019m grateful to our military and intelligence community. Their courage and dedication inspire us all,\u201d Juli\u00e1n Castro (D) said, also omitting any mention of the president. \u201cAbandoning our Syrian and Kurdish partners remains a disastrous decision that will make the fight against ISIS harder,\u201d he added:  \u201cThank you and congratulations to our special operations forces and others involved in tracking and getting rid of ISIS/Daesh leader Baghdadi,\u201d Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) responded, actively bashing what she calls Trump\u2019s \u201cshort-sighted policies\u201d in the remainder of her statement:  Andrew Yang (D) and Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) were among the most generous in their responses, although neither directly congratulated the president. \u201cThe death of al-Baghdadi is a major blow to ISIS and a testament to our armed forces. It will make the world safer,\u201d Yang wrote. While he did not mention Trump by name, he extended his congratulations to the special ops team \u201cthat executed the mission and everyone in the chain of command\u201d:  \u201cThis is a blow against ISIS and an important step in the fight against stateless terrorism. Credit should go to all who were involved; above all to the brave Americans in uniform and intelligence professionals who risked their lives to complete this mission,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cToday, we honor them,\u201d he added:  As Breitbart News pointed out, Trump openly acknowledged former President Obama following the raid that resulted in the death of Osama bin Laden in May 2011, offering personal congratulations after Obama mocked him at the 2011 White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner (WHCD) hours prior to the raid: ",

      "subtitle": "(AP) \u2014 When President Barack Obama was reelected in 2012, a Saudi tycoon and his business associate sent hundreds of thousands of dollars to the U.S. to help pay for the inaugural celebration and get a picture with the president, according to court documents and an analysis of campaign finance records by The Associated Press.",
      "author": "Breitbart News",
      "content": "U.S. election law prohibits foreign nationals from making those sorts of political contributions. But the donations Sheikh Mohammed Al Rahbani tried to send to Obama\u2019s inaugural committee were funneled through a seasoned straw donor, the records and the AP analysis show. That intermediary, Imaad Zuberi, agreed this month to plead guilty to making illegal campaign contributions to several American political candidates on behalf of foreign nationals. He is also set to plead guilty to concealing his work as a foreign agent as he lobbied high-level U.S. government officials. The prosecution by the U.S. attorney in Los Angeles is the latest in a string of cases that highlight the prevalence of banned foreign money in American politics and the often lax approach campaigns take in vetting contributions. Zuberi, a jet-setting fundraiser and venture capitalist, has raised millions of dollars for Democrats and Republicans alike over the years. Prosecutors say he has worked on behalf of several foreigners, not just Rahbani. He served as a top fundraiser for both Obama and Hillary Clinton during their presidential runs, including stints on both of their campaign finance committees, before switching his support to President Donald Trump immediately after his 2016 victory, pumping nearly $1 million into the Republican\u2019s inaugural committee. Federal Election Commission records show hundreds of donations from Zuberi and his family to Republican and Democratic national committees, the presidential campaigns of Trump and Clinton, and dozens of congressional candidates across the political spectrum. Zuberi-linked donations often went to lawmakers who are influential or outspoken on foreign policy issues, like Sen. Lindsey Graham and Democratic Rep. Eliot Engel, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Only Zuberi has been charged in the case, and prosecutors have not alleged that any campaign that received money from him was aware that at least some of his donations were financed by foreigners. Zuberi\u2019s case raises questions about the degree to which political committees vet donors. One campaign, not identified by name, accepted donations made in the name of one of Zuberi\u2019s dead relatives, prosecutors said. Another political committee took donations from a person Zuberi invented. Some donations reported by political campaigns were made in Rahbani\u2019s and others\u2019 names but were paid for with credit cards belonging to Zuberi or his wife, prosecutors said. Requests for comment were sent to representatives for Graham, Clinton and Engel. Steve Kerrigan, CEO of Obama\u2019s 2013 inauguration committee, said it had a very thorough vetting process that included requiring donors to certify that their contributions complied with the law. He declined to comment further on the specifics of Zuberi\u2019s donations. As a middleman, Zuberi was deeply flawed. Zuberi, 49, admitted in a plea agreement that only $97,500 of the $850,000 that he was supposed to deliver to the Obama inaugural committee on Rahbani\u2019s behalf actually made it into the committee\u2019s hands. The rest, he skimmed for himself. Rahbani declined to comment through an assistant. Zuberi\u2019s attorneys and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Los Angeles all declined to comment. The case shares similarities with others recently filed against people accused of channeling banned foreign donations to U.S. candidates. Two associates of Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, pleaded not guilty Wednesday to federal charges they used foreign money to make unlawful campaign contributions to several U.S. candidates and committees. Prosecutors said the donations orchestrated by Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman included a $325,000 contribution to a group supporting Trump\u2019s reelection, made at a time when the pair were lobbying U.S. politicians to oust the country\u2019s ambassador to Ukraine. In April, a Washington political consultant was sentenced to three years of probation after admitting he made a $50,000 straw donation on behalf of a wealthy Ukrainian client who wanted tickets to Trump\u2019s inauguration. Like Zuberi, W. Samuel Patten also was charged with to failing to register as a foreign lobbyist. The FEC earlier this year fined a super PAC that supported Jeb Bush\u2019s failed 2016 Republican presidential bid for accepting $1.3 million in illegal donations from Chinese nationals. Zuberi has also been under scrutiny by federal prosecutors in New York after he donated $900,000 to Trump\u2019s inaugural committee and $100,000 to a Republican campaign committee. Those donations occurred around the time Zuberi accompanied Qatar\u2019s foreign minister to a meeting at Trump Tower. Trump\u2019s inaugural committee has not been accused of wrongdoing in connection with the money it received from Zuberi. It says it has cooperated with the federal inquiry. Rahbani is named in the charging documents in Zuberi\u2019s case only as \u201cPerson A,\u201d but the AP was able to identify him through biographical details in the court filing and by matching the timing and amounts of donations mentioned in the court filing to publicly available campaign finance records. For instance, prosecutors in court filings said \u201cPerson A\u201d and his wife made four donations of $2,700 to \u201cCampaign J\u201d on Sept. 28, 2016, while one of Rahbani\u2019s business associates donated $400 to the same campaign on that date. FEC records indicate that Rahbani, his wife, Kate Rahbani, and one of Rahbani\u2019s business associates made donations in those amounts on that date to Graham\u2019s Senate campaign. Those donations, unlike others in the case, were listed in the FEC records with the Rahbanis\u2019 names and address in London. Graham\u2019s campaign returned some of those donations in 2017, and when doing so listed them as going to Zuberi\u2019s address, FEC records show. Those are just a few of several donations mentioned by prosecutors that the AP was able to match with public campaign records that listed Rahbani and people associated as the donors. Prosecutors also described Person A as having dual citizenship in Saudi Arabia and the United Kingdom, a residence in Switzerland and an American wife. In media profiles, Rahbani has talked about owning homes in London and Switzerland. His wife is an American. The criminal case against Zuberi doesn\u2019t explain why Rahbani would have wanted to contribute to American political campaigns. His company SAFID \u2014 a manufacturer of air conditioning-related products \u2014 is active throughout the Middle East and says on its website that it has worked on projects financed by the Saudi government. Rahbani, in a few past interviews, has talked about his support of Obama. He posted pictures on his website of himself and his wife standing with Obama, former Vice President Joe Biden and their spouses at a 2013 inaugural event. The website was taken down shortly after Zuberi\u2019s plea was made public. Prosecutors said $100,000 from Rahbani\u2019s company meant for the inaugural committee was earmarked for \u201cphotos.\u201d It isn\u2019t unusual for political fundraisers to offer photo sessions with candidates in exchange for donations and such practices are legal \u2014 although the ban on donations from foreign nationals would apply. Zuberi, however, tried to get Rahbani and one of his business associates to donate even more money by falsely claiming they had taken too many people to a photo session with Obama and Biden and owed more money as a result, prosecutors said. \u201cI\u2019m deeply concerned about foreigners trying to intervene in our elections, and I don\u2019t think we\u2019re doing enough to try to stop it,\u201d FEC chairwoman Ellen Weintraub told the AP. \u201cThey don\u2019t get a say in who we elect \u2014 or at least they\u2019re not supposed to.\u201d ___ Suderman reported from Richmond, Virginia.

The world is messy. There are ambiguities. People who do really good stuff have flaws,\u201d Obama said. The failed president singled out the following as a \u201cdanger\u201d for young people\u2026 \u201cAnd I think one danger I see among young people, particularly on college campuses \u2026 and this is accelerated by social media,\u201d he explained, \u201cis this sense sometimes of, \u2018The way of me making change is to be as judgmental as possible about other people, and that\u2019s enough.'\u201d Obama used the example of someone using the wrong \u201cverb,\u201d although he probably meant pronoun, meaning how people are being destroyed for referring to a biological male who thinks he\u2019s a woman as a \u201che.\u201d \u201cLike, if I tweet or hashtag about how you didn\u2019t do something right, or used the wrong verb \u2026 then I can sit back and feel pretty good about myself. \u2018Cause man, you see how woke I was? I called you out.'\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s not activism,\u201d Obama added. \u201cThat\u2019s not bringing about change. If all you\u2019re doing is casting stones, you\u2019re probably not going to get that far.\u201d Before we put a MAGA hat on President Bitter Clinger, what\u2019s important to keep in mind is that if the Fascist Woketard Movement was effective at furthering the left\u2019s agenda, does anyone doubt Obama would be all for it? Listen, this guy lost a brutal re-election campaign in 2016. No, he wasn\u2019t on the ballot, but make no mistake, he was out there next to Hillary promising America a third Obama term, and lost to a man he personally despises, a man who promised to reverse Obama\u2019s entire legacy. Everything Obama spent eight years building, including ISIS *teehee,* Trump has either completely or nearly unraveled or considerably weakened, from the Iran Deal to the Paris Accords to the Obamacare mandate. Unlike his vice president, though, Obama is no dummy. He might not like everyday Americans, but he is not out of touch, and he proved that by winning two national elections by pretty safe margins. In other words, Obama understands that one of the primary reasons Trump won was due to a backlash against increasingly stifling political correctness, which has only gotten worse while Trump has been in office. Obama knows how unattractive this movement is, how it turns off most Americans, and that it plays into the hands of the political right. To Obama\u2019s credit, though, his argument against these puritan fascists is a good one, a moral one, especially what he says at first about how their demand for purity denies the fact that good people can have honest differences, that different ideas about the world, and that ambiguities over absolutes, even flaws, do not equal PURGE THE WITCH!!! Woke is what happens when a large part of our culture rejects the Judeo-Christian ideals of tolerance, a path to redemption, and forgiveness, and instead embraces a secular religion that demands rigid conformity, celebrates intolerance of dissent, and punishes individualism and intellectual diversity.

During a Tuesday appearance at the Obama Foundation Summit in Chicago, she said, \u201cBut unbeknownst to us, we grew up in the period \u2014 as I write \u2014 called \u2018white flight.\u2019 That as families like ours, upstanding families like ours \u2026 As we moved in, white folks moved out because they were afraid of what our families represented.\u201d \u201cAnd I always stop there when I talk about this out in the world because, you know, I want to remind white folks that y\u2019all were running from us.\u201d She went on, \u201cThis family with all the values that you\u2019ve read about. You were running from us. And you\u2019re still running, because we\u2019re no different than the immigrant families that are moving in \u2026 the families that are coming from other places to try to do better.\u201d Did I mention that Michelle and Barry just purchased a $15 million estate in Martha\u2019s Vineyard, which is 95 percent white? Oh, and did I mention the Obamas own a second home, an $8 million mansion, in the exclusive DC neighborhood of Kalorama, which is 80 percent white and just four percent black. Oh, and did I mention the Obamas have a third home, a $5.3 million mansion, in Rancho Mirage, California, which is 89 percent white and just 2.6 percent black. Oh, sure, the Obamas still own their Chicago home in Hyde Park, which is at least 26 percent black. But you would think they could do better than 26 percent! I like Michelle Obama. I have always liked Michelle Obama. I\u2019ve never said an unkind word about her, quite the opposite, and while I find her politics ignorant, she was a terrific first lady. But this is nuts\u2026 Not only is she attacking white people for seeking a better standard of living, which I can assure you (as I will explain below) has little to do with racism, she is also attacking whites after she herself \u201cfled\u201d to 95 percent white Martha\u2019s Vineyard (I will never stop repeating this point) and two other homes in areas where the black population is less than 5 percent. Worse still, she is putting white people in a position where they can never win, where they are damned if they do or don\u2019t, where they are always and forever racist. If white people move out of a black neighborhood, they\u2019re racists engaging in white flight. But\u2026 And this is important\u2026 If white people move into a minority neighborhood, they are also racists for either engaging in gentrification \u2014 which is just another form of cultural genocide, donchaknow \u2014 or cultural appropriation. Now I\u2019m going to tell you a little something about white flight, from my own \u00a0experience\u2026 Because I was poor, back in the mid-eighties, I lived in the inner-city of Milwaukee for two years. My wife and I did not flee (my wife is not white, by the way) because of \u201cicky minorities\u201d (did I mention my wife is not white?), we fled because it was not safe to live there. It was never safe. Over those two years, we had been mugged, robbed, and had our car stolen. That\u2019s why we left. And when we fled, it was to a community that was still not as white as *ahem* Martha\u2019s Vineyard. In 2002, my wife and I moved to California for nine years and lived in an East Los Angeles neighborhood that was just four percent white. For nearly a decade, I was outnumbered 96-4 and never gave it a thought because I was not outnumbered. A darker skin tone, an accent, and different religious traditions did not make my neighbors any less American than me, and when I am among Americans I am among my own. We left because predominantly white leftists are destroying California. Then there\u2019s my poor dad\u2026 He moved to the Northside of Milwaukee in 1980, and spent decades, a lot of money, and a ton of sweat, remodeling his home, building a garage, and paying that home off. He intended to retire there. And yes, there were black people in his neighborhood when he moved in, and for most of his adult life he worked in predominantly black institutions. He never intended to move, and held on for as long as he could\u2026 He didn\u2019t flee because of black people. He was not forced to start all over at age 67 because he suddenly decided he didn\u2019t like blacks. He left because he was robbed, because gangs started tagging his house and garage, because it was no longer safe to live there. You know\u2026 If we\u2019re going to shame people for such things, what does it say to black people when other black people, especially the first black president and his family, reject them? What the hell kind of message is this to send to black Americans, especially when the Obamas can afford the security to live safely in any neighborhood they choose? And if the Obamas wanted to live in Southern California, why choose Rancho Mirage over Ladera Heights, the Black Beverly Hills, a predominantly black neighborhood as swank as any in America? Shame on Michelle and Barack Obama. They have the money and profile to make an important statement on this issue, but they obviously prefer to live in overwhelmingly white neighborhoods.

      "content": "On October 23, Federal Judge Christopher Cooper from the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ordered State to provide the documents to the organization American Oversight within 30 days. The State Department reportedly agreed on Wednesday to provide the information to American Oversight by November 22. American Oversight filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) to get the documents. Cooper\u2019s October 23 ruling came amid the House Democrats\u2019 partisan impeachment inquiry. Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine are at the center of the investigation. It appears that American Oversight is helping its Democrat allies with their efforts to impeach and remove Trump. So far, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has refused to produce documents sought by House Democrat impeachment investigators. On Wednesday, McClatchy reported: According to a brief filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on Wednesday night, the State Department settled on terms for the records release with American Oversight, an ethics watchdog that sued for a swift release of the records in court. The records will also include communications from Pompeo\u2019s inner circle with [President Donald Trump\u2019s private lawyer Rudy] Giuliani or with any other individuals outside of government related to Giuliani\u2019s Ukraine efforts. \u2026 According to its joint filing with American Oversight updating the court, the State Department agreed to release communications \u2013 including text messages, e-mails, and electronic calendar entries \u2013 \u201cwith the appropriate redactions\u201d regarding the president\u2019s efforts to pressure the Ukrainian government to investigate the family of former Vice President Joe Biden. That effort is currently the subject of a House impeachment inquiry. \u2026 The State Department will also search for and release \u201cfinal directives\u201d \u2013 from either the White House or State Department leadership \u2013 to recall the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, and accompanying explanations. Wednesday\u2019s brief came in response to Judge Cooper\u2019s October 23 request for a status update. Pompeo has vowed to fulfill his department\u2019s legal obligations in the impeachment probe but has refused to release documents requested by investigators. The secretary has said the State Department would take a cue from the White House, which is refusing to cooperate with House Democrats pursuing the impeachment inquiry. Last week, Pompeo declared that he saw \u201cno reason\u201d for State to refuse abiding by the October 23 ruling.",

      "author": "Michael Patrick Leahy",
      "content": "It was a warmup for the evening\u2019s Democrat Party Liberty and Justice Celebration and fundraiser at the Wells Fargo Arena, where thousands of rank-and-file Democrats are expected to listen to 14 of the candidates vying for the 2020 Democrat presidential nomination explain why Iowa Caucus attendees should back them. Breitbart News spoke with two of the Buttigieg volunteers, one from Santa Barbara and another from San Diego, who said they were part of 150 volunteers who paid their own way to come to Iowa to support the Buttigieg campaign. One volunteer said that a total of 1,200 Buttigieg volunteers from around the country flew to Des Moines to lend their support to Buttigieg. \u201cI\u2019m strictly a volunteer. I absolutely paid for my travel here myself,\u201d Laurie from Santa Barbara told Breitbart News. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be at least 150 to 200 people from California for Pete tonight,\u201d she added. Laurie had a succinct explanation for why she made the trip to Des Moines. \u201cThis is a big deal for the Democratic Party to be participating in this event. As we all know, this is the event tonight that turned around the polls and the momentum for Barack Obama. And we see the same thing happening for Pete,\u201d she said. Laurie was also optimistic about Buttigieg\u2019s chances of winning the Iowa Caucuses outright, saying, \u201cIf you look at the polls released this morning from CNN it basically shows a four-way tie for first place.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re here as part of the barnstorming effort for Pete. It\u2019s a group of volunteers who feel so inspired by Pete running for president that we paid our own way to fly to Iowa to meet with the folks here and get visibility for Pete and explain our personal stories as to why we feel Pete is the most qualified person to be president,\u201d George, who said he is a deputy city clerk from San Diego, told Breitbart News. \u201cI feel like Pete speaks to the division in the country, and why we need to have a candidate to bring everyone together. He speaks about the day after the election how divided the country will be, regardless of who the next president is, and how important it will be to everyone in the country to feel that the person that\u2019s been elected speaks to them. So he\u2019s staking out a ground that speaks to, not either side, but to both sides of the country,\u201d George added. When pressed by Breitbart News to explain how Buttigieg\u2019s support for the ongoing impeachment inquiry of President Trump by Democrats in the House of Representatives\u2014which many Republicans have characterized as a grossly unfair and un-American partisan witch hunt\u2014would unite the country, George was unable to provide a compelling response. \u201cEach of these individual candidates has a position as to whether the president has committed a high crime or misdemeanor. That\u2019s the position they\u2019re taking. I feel that, for a lot of folks, an inquisition, or an inquiry is important for everybody to look into,\u201d George said Breitbart News spoke with two Buttigieg volunteers from Indiana at another venue in Des Moines on Friday morning who confirmed that volunteers have flown in to Des Moines from around the country at their own expense, but could not confirm the number of such volunteers. As many as 200,000 Iowa Democrats are expected to gather across the state on February 3 for a first-in-the-nation electoral contest to determine the party\u2019s presidential nominee for the November 2020 general election. Blue and yellow \u201cPete 2020\u201d campaign signs are widely visible in downtown Des Moines, a clear indication that the presidential campaign of the 37-year-old two-term mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is well organized on the ground in advance of the evening\u2019s event. Other campaigns, including those of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), former Vice President Joe Biden (D), and Andrew Yang (D), also had street signage visible in Des Moines on Friday, but most of that was within a thousand feet of the Wells Fargo Arena. In advance of the evening, all the major presidential campaigns hosted meet and greet events near the Wells Fargo Arena on Friday afternoon in hopes of creating volunteer enthusiasm and support for their candidate at the evening\u2019s event. The Buttigieg campaign is clearly hoping that the candidate\u2019s speech this evening\u2013where each candidate is limited to a ten minute address\u2013will give him the same kind of boost that Obama received when he addressed the same event 11 years earlier in 2007.",

Buttigieg also ridiculed the president for organizing a military parade, boasting that he served in Afghanistan and had seen the \u201cdust of a war zone.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t have to throw myself a military parade to see what a convoy looks like, \u2018cause I was driving in one around Afghanistan right about the time this president was taping Season 7 of Celebrity Apprentice,\u201d he said. He claimed that Americans were hungry to end the division in their country and bring an end to the Trump presidency, which he promised would be \u201can end to the chaos, and the corruption, and the tantrums and the tweets.\u201d The South Bend mayor promised a new coalition of progressives, moderates, and \u201cRepublicans of conscience\u201d who wanted a change in the Oval Office. He promised to fight Trump in the 2020 election, arguing that the president\u2019s political playbook would not work on him. Trump, he argued, was more focused on promoting his own victories than trying to united the country. \u201cWe know that the purpose of the presidency is not the glorification of the president, it is the unification of the American people,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is why we have the office.\u201d",

      "subtitle": "A newly launched super PAC backing former Vice President Joe Biden is turning to one of his son\u2019s lobbying colleagues to help run its operation.",
      "author": "Haris Alic",
      "content": "Earlier this week, a high-powered lobbyist and Biden family confidant established Unite the Country, a super PAC aimed at bolstering the former vice president\u2019s flailing campaign.\u00a0The group, which can raise and spend unlimited funds, was formed after Joe Biden\u2019s campaign dropped its official opposition to such help in the face of anemic fundraising and sinking poll numbers. Although much attention has been paid to Unite the Country\u2019s formation and the fact that its treasurer, Larry Rasky, is registered as a foreign agent for the government of Azerbaijan, few have been able to ascertain who else might be implicated in the endeavor. One individual, in particular, seems to be heavily involved in the group, yet has escaped public mention, likely because only his email appears on official filings Unite the Country made with the Federal Election Commission. That individual, as Breitbart News has been to able to confirm, is William J. Farah,\u00a0a lobbyist with longstanding ties to both the former vice president and his youngest son, Hunter.\u00a0Even though it is unclear what Farah\u2019s role will be at Unite the Country\u2014requests for comment were not returned by the super PAC\u2014his lobbying work may shed some light on the matter. Farah, who touts himself as a campaign finance and anti-corruption expert, is\u00a0the principal partner at Berke Farah LLP, where he advises \u201cclients on the applicability of the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA).\u201d Prior to starting his own firm, Farah developed a reputation as one of D.C.\u2019s top lobbyists, catering to corporate giants like\u00a0Pfizer Inc. Part of that career was built at Oldaker, Biden & Belair, LLP, a lobbying firm started\u00a0by Hunter Biden and one of his father\u2019s top campaign operatives, William Oldaker. Upon its founding in 2001, the firm was noted for its strong connections to then-Sen. Joe Biden, who at the time was one of the most senior and influential members of Congress. Apart from employing the younger Biden as a named partner, despite his inexperience with lobbying, the firm also counted among its clientele several organizations whose interests intersected with the senator\u2019s influence. Those interests came in varied forms.\u00a0Some clients, like the consumer credit reporting agency Equifax, had a vested stake in legislation that the senator was pushing to tighten bankruptcy regulations. An analysis of Oldaker, Biden\u2019s financials indicates Equifax paid the firm as much $240,000 a year between 2003 and 2005 while Joe Biden was writing the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005. The sum fell to $120,000 in 2006 after the bill had become law. Other clients, as the Washington Examiner recently revealed, were able to benefit directly from the senator\u2019s political position. One such client was the Industrial Safety Training Council (ISTC), a trade association that promotes safety and security in industrial worksites. The ISTC signed on as a client with Oldaker, Biden in 2007, as it was seeking to pressure the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to adopt regulations \u201cregarding security clearance and credentialing for chemical\u201d facilities. Shortly after ISTC paid the firm the first installment of what would amount to more than $160,000 throughout 2008, Joe Biden reached out to DHS to express his concern over the issue. The senator purportedly argued that a recently\u00a0passed law regarding security clearances at chemical plants was not sufficient and that DHS should consider requiring enhanced background checks. The argument, even if unconnected to ISTC, was directly out of its lobbying handbook. Around the same time that Joe Biden contacted DHS, he also reached out to the Department of Justice (DOJ) on another issue his son\u2019s firm was being paid lucratively to lobby on. In January 2007, the senator requested a meeting with then-Attorney General Alberto Gonzales to discuss expanding the federal database that crosschecks fingerprints with criminal records. The same day the letter was sent, SEARCH\u2014The National Consortium for Justice Information and Statistics\u2014passed a resolution calling on Congress to expand and improve its fingerprint background check infrastructure. The group, which is a coalition of state-based criminal justice organizations, hired Oldaker, Biden in 2002 to lobby Congress in favor of funding for justice information sharing programs. Although SEARCH was one of the firm\u2019s smaller clients when it first signed on,\u00a0by 2006 it had grown to be Oldaker, Biden\u2019s most consistent stream of revenue. Even though the senator was not successful with the DOJ in 2007, SEARCH re-upped its contract with Oldaker, Biden in 2008 but specifically tasked the firm to lobby in favor of a national fingerprint background check system. The group\u2019s efforts were aided in March 2008 when the senator introduced the \u201cChild Protection Improvement Act\u201d that sought to create a national fingerprint background check system for individuals that volunteer with children. Upon the bill\u2019s introduction, Oldaker, Biden proceeded to lobby Congress for its passage. The appearance of conflicts of interest between the senator and Oldaker, Biden were strong enough to force Hunter Biden\u2019s resignation from the firm in 2008, shortly after his father was tapped as the Democrat\u2019s vice presidential nominee. Despite the younger Biden\u2019s resignation, other members of the firm continued to move easily between the senator\u2019s inner-circle and the lobbying world of Washington, DC. Farah was one such individual. As a partner at the firm specializing in campaign finance law, Farah was tapped in 2007 to serve as the general counsel for Joe Biden\u2019s failed presidential bid that cycle. Even though the senator dropped out of the race in January 2008 after a poor showing in the Iowa Caucuses, Farah continued to serve as the campaign\u2019s general counsel. Via the role, Oldaker, Biden was paid more than $150,000 for his services throughout October 2008. Farah did not respond to requests for comment on this story. His ties to both Unite the Country and Hunter Biden come into the spotlight as the former vice president and his son deny any conflict of interest over their respective positions in business and government. The controversy started in September when President Donald Trump\u00a0suggested\u00a0the Ukrainian government probe into how the younger Biden secured an appointment to Burisma Holdings\u2019 board, shortly after his father was made\u00a0the Obama administration\u2019s point man on Ukraine. As Peter Schweizer, senior contributor at Breitbart News,\u00a0detailed\u00a0in his book\u00a0Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends, Hunter Biden secured the position, which\u00a0paid\u00a0as much as\u00a0$83,000 per month, despite no background in energy or Ukraine. Adding to concerns is the fact that at the time Hunter Biden joined Burisma, the company was seen as actively courting Western leaders to prevent further scrutiny of its business practices. The same month Hunter Biden was tapped for the group\u2019s board, the government of Great Britain froze accounts belonging to Burisma founder Mykola Zlochevsky under suspicion of money laundering. Not only had Zlochevsky had his assets frozen in Great Britain, but the former Ukrainian minister of natural resources was also facing suspicions of public corruption at home. Zlochevsky would later be charged with corruption for using his ministerial office to approve oil and gas licenses to companies under his control. It is in the context of Burisma and Zlochevsky\u2019s legal troubles that Joe Biden\u2019s political influence has raised the most red flags. The former vice president has particularly drawn questions over his conduct in demanding the Ukrainian government fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, in 2016. Joe Biden, who has publicly\u00a0bragged\u00a0about the firing, reportedly threatened to withhold more than one billion\u00a0dollars in U.S. aid if the Ukrainian government did not remove Shokin. He has claimed the demand came from then-President Barack Obama, who had allegedly lost faith in the prosecutor\u2019s ability to tackle corruption. Unofficially, though, it was known that Shokin was investigating both Burisma and Zlochevsky for public corruption. It is uncertain if the probe extended to Hunter Biden, although Shokin has recently admitted that prior to his ouster he was\u00a0warned\u00a0to back off the matter. Regardless of what occurred, Shokin\u2019s successor, who is now himself being\u00a0investigated\u00a0for public corruption,\u00a0dropped the investigation into Burisma and Zlochevsky. The matter is only likely to become bigger as the House of Representatives weighs whether Trump\u2019s initial urging for Ukraine to investigate Hunter Biden\u2019s dealings with Burisma was an impeachable offense. The younger Biden, himself, has not done much to allay concerns over his conduct, even\u00a0telling\u00a0ABC News recently that he regretted getting\u00a0entangled \u201cin the middle of something that is a \u2026 swamp in many ways.\u201d",

      "content": "President Trump has signed off on the refugee resettlement program\u2019s cap for Fiscal Year 2020, the Associated Press confirmed. For the year, no more than 18,000 refugees will be resettled in the U.S. \u2014 an at least 80 percent reduction to former President Obama\u2019s refugee inflow.\u00a0This is merely a numerical limit and not a goal federal officials are supposed to reach. Compared to this year, Trump will be reducing refugee admissions by at least 40 percent. For Fiscal Year 2019, which ran between October 1, 2018, and September 30, 2019, a total of 30,000 refugees were resettled across the U.S. More than 12,900 refugees resettled this year came from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Another 4,900 arrived from Burma, and more than 4,400 arrived from Ukraine. The majority of these refugees are either Christians, Catholics, Protestants, or other sects of Protestantism.\u00a0Meanwhile, the nearly 1,200 refugees who arrived from Afghanistan this year are Muslim. More than half of all refugees resettled this year arrived in 12 states. Texas absorbed the most refugees with nearly 2,500 being resettled there. Washington, New York, California, Ohio, Kentucky, North Carolina, Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Illinois each absorbed more than 1,000 refugees this year. As Breitbart News has reported, the U.S. has permanently resettled more than\u00a01.7 million\u00a0foreign nationals and refugees through a variety of humanitarian programs \u2014 a foreign population larger than the size of Philadelphia, which has 1.5 million residents. Refugee resettlement costs American taxpayers nearly\u00a0$9 billion\u00a0every five years, according to the latest research. Over the course of five years, an estimated 16 percent of all refugees admitted will need housing assistance paid for by taxpayers. John Binder is a reporter\u00a0for Breitbart News.

He reminded voters that Biden said that China was not a threat to the United States, after allowing the communist country to commit economic\u201dpiracy and plunder\u201d against the United States when he was vice president. Trump also reminded his supporters that Hunter Biden secured a $1.5 billion investment for his firm from the state-owned Bank of China in 2014, just days after visiting the country with his father while Biden was Vice President. \u201cHe\u2019ll make millions and millions on that,\u201d Trump said, referring to the investment, and added, \u201cThe Bidens got rich while America got robbed.\u201d The president again said that Chinese leaders would love to see Biden become the next president, so they could make an easier deal with the United States. \u201cThis is what China would love more than anything else,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen, folks, because we can\u2019t let our country go back to hell.

For 50 years NRDC has stood up for the protection of our environment and the health of people. \u201cThe climate crisis is the central challenge of our time,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cThe stakes have never been higher, and NRDC has never been stronger.\u201d \u201cNRDC was built for this moment,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cIt was built for this mission.\u201d \u201cI am excited to work to expand NRDC\u2019s reach and strengthen our capacity to drive needed change,\u201d McCarthy said. NRDC praised McCarthy\u2019s work as head of EPA under Barack Obama, including her help on the Paris Climate Accord. The announcement of her hiring comes on the same day that President Donald Trump announced the official departure \u00a0of the U.S. from the climate agreement: In her role as U.S. EPA Administrator, McCarthy oversaw some of the most consequential work in the agency\u2019s history, including strengthening safeguards for clean water and air, setting the first-ever limits on carbon pollution from power plants and advancing the U.S. environmental diplomacy that helped produce the landmark 2015 Paris climate agreement. The announcement does not mention McCarthy\u2019s role in the disastrous toxic spill into Colorado\u2019s Animas River, which Breitbart News reported on in August 2015: The same environmental groups who called for severe penalties against companies and industry executives responsible for similar environmental catastrophes are singing a different tune now that the EPA has caused a toxic waste blowout into Colorado\u2019s Animas River. A spokesperson for the NRDC elaborated on the organization\u2019s views in an interview with Breitbart News. \u201cEPA Administrator Gina McCarthy said on Tuesday everyone at EPA was very sorry for the spill and would work to make sure this tragedy never happens again,\u201d NRDC spokesperson and director of strategic engagement Bob Deans tells Breitbart News. Deans says NRDC thinks the EPA should be \u201cheld accountable\u201d for the spill, but was unable to say what \u201cholding them accountable\u201d actually means. He declined to call for the firing of any EPA executives, when asked specifically whether EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy or EPA Region 8 Administrator Sean McGrath should be fired. \u201cWe want to withhold comment until all the facts are in. You know, when the BP oil rig blew out in the Gulf Coast a few years ago, it took months to find out what happened.\u201d \u201cMcCarthy will be taking the helm of NRDC at the most critical time in the environmental movement\u2019s history,\u201d the press release said. \u201cShe will support NRDC\u2019s work to defend bedrock natural resources and public health protections, while advancing vital solutions to our climate crisis across the world.\u201d Follow Penny Starr on Twitter",

      "author": "Matthew Boyle",
      "content": "Republicans had held one-seat majorities in both chambers until Tuesday, when Democrats in the Tuesday elections flipped a number of competitive seats from GOP to Democrat control. In the State Senate, Democrats now have at least 21 seats, while Republicans have at least 18 seats, and the GOP leads in one final yet-to-be-called race. In the House of Delegates, Democrats won 53 seats and Republicans won 43 seats. Democrats lead one yet-to-be-called delegate race, and Republicans lead two such races. Democrats already have control of the governor\u2019s mansion, the lieutenant governor\u2019s office, and attorney general\u2019s office\u2013these three offices were not on the ballot in 2019 and won\u2019t be again until 2021\u2013but Tuesday\u2019s sweep into majorities in both chambers of the legislature marks the first time since 1993 Democrats have consolidated complete control in Richmond.  It also comes as Democrats control both U.S. Senate seats in Virginia, as Republicans have fallen short in recent years on that front, and now a majority of the U.S. House seats from the state after the 2018 midterm elections. A Republican has not won a statewide election in Virginia since 2009, according to the Washington Post, and the last time a Republican won the state in a presidential election was George W. Bush\u2019s 2004 re-election campaign. Democrats outspent and outgunned Republicans in the state this cycle, blowing away the GOP in the Old Dominion state, according to the Post: Democrats consolidated power in Richmond for the first time in a generation, completing the political evolution of a Southern state on Washington\u2019s doorstep from red to blue. Both U.S. Senators, a majority of the congressional delegation and all three statewide office holders are Democrats and the state went Democratic in the last three presidential elections. Republicans have not won a statewide contest since 2009. National Democratic organizations and interest groups \u2013 from gun control to women\u2019s rights to clean energy \u2013 carpeted the state with money, boosting suburban legislative races to the spending level of congressional elections. What\u2019s more, former President Barack Obama and other top Democrats were engaged at an usually microscopic level\u2013the former president personally endorsed a number of state legislative candidates for both the House of Delegates and the State Senate\u2013in a way nominal leaders of a political party usually do not:  Now that Democrats have complete control in Richmond, it remains to be seen what exactly they will do with that power. But the Democrat Party in Virginia has been rocked by scandals all year, as earlier this year photographs of Gov. Ralph Northam from his yearbook showing a man in blackface and another in a Ku Klux Klan outfit emerged. Northam has admitted to wearing blackface on other occasions, as has Attorney General Mark Herring. Meanwhile, Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax has fended off accusations from women that he sexually assaulted them, something that resurfaced in nasty campaign ads for the state legislature in the final days of this campaign.",

      "author": "Aaron Klein",
      "content": "That and other emails show Ciaramella interfaced about Ukraine with individuals who played key roles in facilitating the infamous anti-Trump dossier produced by Fusion GPS and reportedly financed by Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee. One of those individuals, then-Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs Victoria Nuland (pictured), received updates on Ukraine issues from dossier author Christopher Steele in addition to Nuland\u2019s direct role in the dossier controversy. Also part of the email chains was Christopher J. Anderson, who was a special adviser to former special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker. Anderson testified to the Democrat-led House committees running the impeachment inquiry. Ciaramella\u2019s name comes up in six Obama-era government emails that were released by the State Department as part of two previous Freedom of Information Act requests.\u00a0 At the time of the exchanges, Ciaramella served as the Director for Baltic and Eastern European Affairs for the Obama-era National Security Council, where he worked on Ukraine policy.\u00a0 He is now an analyst at the Central Intelligence Agency. One email, titled, \u201cLoan Guarantee,\u201d involved Nuland, who was reportedly a key champion of the Ukraine loan guarantee policy. \u201cHurray,\u201d a celebratory Nuland wrote in response to a translated Ukrainian government announcement about the signing of the $1 billion loan guarantee.\u00a0 The announcement singles out Joe Biden as being present for the conclusion of an agreement leading to the loan guarantee. Ciaramella was one of several people CC\u2019d in the email, which was sent from the U.S. ambassador at the time, Geoffrey Pyatt, who was another key champion of the loan guarantee to Ukraine along with Nuland. The email is one of several that shows Ciaramella in the loop with top officials such as Nuland working on Ukraine policy under the Obama administration. The loan guarantee was pushed through after Ukraine agreed to several reforms, especially the firing of the nation\u2019s top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin. This at a time that Shokin was reportedly investigating Burisma, the Ukranian natural gas company paying Hunter Biden.\u00a0 Joe Biden infamously boasted on video about personally threatening to withhold loan guarantees from Ukraine unless Shokin was removed. Another released email shows Ciaramella himself sending a message to Nuland and others. Most of the contents are blocked out, including the email\u2019s subject line. One non-classified section of that email shows a reply stating, \u201cEmbassy Kyiv \u2014 coordinated with our USAID mission folks \u2014 will have detailed input tomorrow.\u201d One email involving Nuland was sent two days before the loan guarantee was signed on June 3, 2016. \u201cCan you confirm who will be doing the actual signing for each side?\u201d the exchange asked. Nuland has come under repeated fire for her various roles in the anti-Trump dossier controversy. FBI notes also cite career Justice Department official Bruce Ohr as saying that Nuland was in touch with Fusion GPS co-founder and dossier producer Glenn Simpson. Sen. John McCain, who infamously delivered the dossier to then-FBI Director James Comey, reportedly first dispatched an aide, David J. Kramer, to inquire with Nuland about the dossier claims. In their book, Russian Roulette: The Inside Story of Putin\u2019s War on America and the Election of Donald Trump, authors and reporters Michael Isikoff and David Corn write that Nuland gave the green light for the FBI to first meet with Steele regarding his dossier\u2019s claims. It was at that meeting that Steele initially reported his dossier charges to the FBI, the book relates. Meanwhile, looped into email chains with Ciaramella was then-Secretary of State John Kerry\u2019s chief of staff at the State Department, John Finer. An extensive New Yorker profile of Steele named Finer as obtaining the contents of a two-page summary of the dossier and eventually deciding to share the questionable document with Kerry. Finer reportedly received the dossier summary from Jonathan M. Winer, the Obama State Department official who acknowledged regularly interfacing and exchanging information with Steele, according to the report. Winer previously conceded that he shared the dossier summary with Nuland. After his name surfaced in news media reports related to probes by House Republicans into the dossier, Winer authored a Washington Post oped in which he conceded that while he was working at the State Department he exchanged documents and information with Steele. Winer further acknowledged that while at the State Department, he shared anti-Trump material with Steele passed to him by longtime Clinton confidant Sidney Blumenthal, whom Winer described as an \u201cold friend.\u201d Winer wrote that the material from Blumenthal \u2013 which Winer in turn gave to Steele \u2013 originated with Cody Shearer, who is a controversial figure long tied to various Clinton scandals. In testimony last year, Nuland made statements about a meeting at the State Department in October 2016 between State officials and Steele, but said that she didn\u2019t participate. At a June 2018 hearing, Sen. Richard Burr (R-NC) revealed contents of the State Department\u2019s visitor logs while he was grilling Nuland. At the hearing, Burr asked: \u201cI know you talked extensively with our staff relative to Mr. Steele. Based upon our review of the visitor logs of the State Department, Mr. Steele visited the State Department briefing officials on the dossier in October of 2016. Did you have any role in that briefing?\u201d \u201cI did not,\u201d Nuland replied. \u201cI actively chose not to be part of that briefing.\u201d \u201cBut were you aware of that briefing?\u201d Burr asked. \u201cI was not aware of it until afterwards,\u201d Nuland retorted. Nuland did not explain how she can actively chose not to be part of Steele\u2019s briefing, as she claimed, yet say she was unaware of the briefing until after it occurred. Nuland was not asked about the discrepancy during the public section of the testimony, which was reviewed in full by Breitbart News. Nuland previously served as chief of staff to Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott under Bill Clinton\u2019s administration, and then served as deputy director for former Soviet Union affairs. Nuland faced confirmation questions prior to her most recent appointment as assistant secretary of state over her reported role in revising controversial Obama administration talking points about the 2012 Benghazi terrorist attacks. Her reported changes sought to protect Hillary Clinton\u2019s State Department from accusations that it failed to adequately secure the woefully unprotected U.S. Special Mission in Benghazi. Likely \u2018whistleblower\u2019 A RealClearInvestigations report by investigative journalist and author Paul Sperry named Ciaramella as best fitting the description of the so-called whistleblower. Officials with direct knowledge of the proceedings say Ciaramella\u2019s name has been raised in private in impeachment depositions and during at least one House open hearing that was not part of the formal impeachment proceedings. Federal documents show Ciaramella also worked closely with Joe Biden and worked under Susan Rice, President Obama\u2019s national security adviser. He also worked with former CIA Director John Brennan, an anti-Trump advocate who has faced controversy for his role in fueling the questionable Russia collusion investigation.\u00a0 Rice participated in Russia collusion probe meetings and reportedly unmasked senior members of Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. Sperry cites former White House officials saying Ciaramella worked for Biden on Ukrainian policy issues in 2015 and 2016, encompassing the time period for which Biden has been facing possible conflict questions for leading Ukraine policy in light of Hunter Biden\u2019s work for Burisma. Mark Zaid and Andrew Bakaj, the activist attorneys representing the so-called whistleblower, refused to confirm on deny that their secretive client is indeed Ciaramella. \u201cWe neither confirm nor deny the identity of the Intelligence Community Whistleblower,\u201d the lawyers told the Washington Examiner in response to an inquiry about Ciaramella. Zaid and Bakaj added, \u201cOur client is legally entitled to anonymity. Disclosure of the name of any person who may be suspected to be the whistleblower places that individual and their family in great physical danger. Any physical harm the individual and/or their family suffers as a result of disclosure means that the individuals and publications reporting such names will be personally liable for that harm. Such behavior is at the pinnacle of irresponsibility and is intentionally reckless.\u201d On Sunday, Trump responded to press reports naming Ciaramella, calling him a \u201cradical\u201d known for his close ties to Brennan and Rice. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll tell you what. There have been stories written about a certain individual, a male, and they say he\u2019s the whistleblower,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201cIf he\u2019s the whistleblower, he has no credibility because he\u2019s a Brennan guy, he\u2019s a Susan Rice guy, he\u2019s an Obama guy.\u201d Trump added, \u201cAnd he hates Trump. And he\u2019s a radical. Now, maybe it\u2019s not him. But if it\u2019s him, you guys ought to release the information.\u201d Aaron Klein is Breitbart\u2019s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

      "subtitle": "Finally, we may have solved the mystery of how former President Obama managed to drag the U.S. into the Paris Climate Accord \u2013 effectively a form of binding international treaty \u2013 without the necessary Congressional ratification.",
      "author": "James Delingpole",
      "content": "According to a lawsuit filed Monday, the Obama administration fudged the issue by misrepresenting U.S. Senate instructions set forth in 1992 to pretend that what was a treaty somehow wasn\u2019t a treaty. The implication is that the Obama administration lied in order to railroad through a policy that it feared might get vetoed by Congress. The case, brought by the public interest law firm Government Accountability & Oversight, centres on an Obama-era State Department Circular 175 memo. The suit, on behalf of the nonprofit group Energy Policy Advocates (EPA), seeks records requested in June 2019, including the memorandum setting forth State\u2019s \u201cworking law\u201d claiming that the U.S. could enter Paris \u2013 what the Obama White House called \u201cthe most ambitious climate agreement in history\u201d \u2013 without obtaining Senate approval required of treaties. The complaint notes that EPA has come into possession of a document purporting to be theObama State Department\u2019s \u201cCircular 175\u201d memo, a required legal justification which State has been improperly hiding from the public. GAO\u2019s Chris Horner, co-author of a 2017 paper \u201cTheLegal and Economic Case Against the Paris Treaty\u201d, notes that: If this document EPA has obtained is in fact the actual Circular 175 memo, it represents a major political and legal scandal with significant implications for U.S. participation in Paris, and the effort to bind the U.S. without following the Constitution. This memo demonstrates the Obama administration\u2019s unlawful entry into the Paris treaty. Under the\u00a0Constitution\u2019s Article II, Section 2, no president can commit the U.S. to treaties without Senate advice and consent. But on the previous occasion the U.S. was offered the chance to enter an international climate agreement under these Senate ground rules \u2013 the 1997 Kyoto Protocol \u2013 the Senate did not ratify it. The Obama administration was anxious to avoid the Paris Climate Accord meeting the same rejection \u2013 and so sought ways to disguise the fact that what was billed as\u00a0\u201cthe most ambitious climate change agreement in history\u201d was also a treaty. It did this, Government Accountability & Oversight\u2019s Chris Horner argues, by sleight of hand: This 18-page memo bases its argument that Paris need not face Article II, Section 2 \u201cadvice and consent\u201d in key part on a gross and material misrepresentation of the history of prior climate agreements supposedly authorizing Pres. Obama\u2019s unilateral \u201cratification\u201d of Paris. The memo falsely asserts that the U.S. Senate, in ratifying the UN Framework Convention in 1992, limited agreements that \u201cwould need to be submitted to the Senate for advise and consent (Exec. Rept. 102-55, p. 14)\u201d to those that claim to have \u201clegally binding targets and timetables\u201d. This is demonstrably false, and likely related to the secrecy with which State has treated this document. Damningly, on this one point the advocacy-heavy \u201cMemorandum of Law\u201d curiously avoids quoting the cited page 14 of Exec. Rept. 102-55, \u201cReport to Accompany Treaty Doc. 102-38\u201d, which in fact says something very different. There the Senate clearly set forth two, distinct hypothetical agreements requiring Senate approval, one of which is any decision \u201cto adopt targets and timetables\u201d \u2013 not just those purporting to be \u201clegally binding\u201d (e.g., Kyoto, Paris).[1] The mystery since 2015 of how the Obama administration skirted this reality is now solved: the memo legally justifying U.S. participation in the Paris Agreement without Senate approval misrepresents the U.S. Senate position. It did so by sleight-of-hand, in a parenthetical invention: \u201c\u2018targets and timetables\u2019 [was] understood in that context to mean legally binding targets\u201d[2]. This is unsupported, and in Rept. 102-55 the Senate used both terms deliberately, to describe two distinct scenarios: first, any decision \u201cto adopt targets and timetables would have to be submitted to the Senate for its advice and consent before the United States could deposit its instruments of ratification for such an agreement\u201d, which of course describes Paris; \u201cfurther\u201d, any attempt to convert the UNFCCC\u2019s non-binding promise then before the Senate into \u201clegally binding targets and timetables \u2026would alter the \u2018shared understanding\u2019 of the Convention between the Senate and the executive branch and would therefore require the Senate\u2019s advice and consent.\u201d In short, the Obama administration misrepresented the facts to involve the U.S. in Paris, and to avoid a repeat of the Kyoto \u201caccord\u201d which died when the Senate refused to even consider it. President Trump confirmed last month that the U.S. is definitely pulling out of the Paris Accord. As is so often the way with these arrangements \u2013 see also: Brexit \u2013 it\u2019s a lot easier to enter them than it is to exit them. As Daily Caller reports: Trump can\u00a0finally\u00a0make the pullout official Monday. The terms stipulate that a partnering country cannot withdraw within the first three years of submission. Trump can send a letter to the United Nations Monday announcing his intention. It won\u2019t become official until one day after the 2020 election.",

      "subtitle": "Former President Barack Obama may live a stone\u2019s throw away from Virginia now, but his sway over the state\u2019s political landscape came up short on Tuesday.",
      "author": "Haris Alic",
      "content": "Obama, who lives in the elite Washington, DC, enclave of Kalorama, has taken an interest in Virginia politics since leaving the White House. In 2017, the former president endorsed a slate of Democrat candidates running for Virginia\u2019s top three statewide offices. The following year, Obama actively actively hit the campaign trail to see Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA),\u00a0\u00a0a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee and failed vice presidential candidate, reelected. This year was no different, especially with control of the Virginia General Assembly up for grabs. Last weekend, as election day neared, Obama issued an endorsement of 17 legislative candidates, he claimed were ready to advance a slew of liberal priorities in Virginia. Most of the candidates were first time office seekers, with a few incumbents thrown into the mix. \u201cProud to endorse an outstanding group of Virginia Democrats in Tuesday\u2019s election\u2014candidates who\u2019ll not only advance the causes of equality, justice, and decency, but help ensure that the next decade of voting maps are drawn fairly,\u201d the former president wrote on social media. \u201cThat\u2019s good policy\u2014and good for our politics.\u201d  Despite the former president\u2019s rousing endorsement, along with a hefty cash infusion from his allies across the country, a majority of the candidates failed to be elected on Tuesday. The losses by Obama\u2019s preferred candidates came even as Democrats Virginia swept to power in both chambers of the Virginia legislature, setting themselves to control all three branches of state government for the first since 1993. Such an accomplishment, while significant, cannot be attributed to Obama. Of the six Democrats the former president endorsed for the Virginia State Senate only two succeeded in garnering support at the ballot box, while three lost outright. One of the races is still too-close to call, but Republicans maintain a strong lead. Obama endorsed the Democrat candidates in Virginia Senate races in the 7th, 8th, 10th, 11th, 12th, and 13th districts, and lost the 7th, 8th, and 11th districts. The 12th district has the Republican leading by two percent but has not yet been called, meaning Obama only won in the 10th and 13th districts. That means the former president went two for six in state Senate races, a measly 33 percent win rate. Obama had a slightly better, but far from perfect, track record in House of Delegates races.\u00a0In the House of Delegates races, Obama endorsed the Democrat candidates in the 21st, 27th, 28th, 40th, 51st, 66th, 83rd, 84th, 85th, 94th, and 100th districts. Democrats won the 21st, 28th, 40th, 51st, 85th, and 94th districts, and lead a not-yet-called race in the 83rd. Republicans won the 66th and 100th, and currently lead not-yet-called races in the 27th and 84th. Assuming those final margins hold, that means of the 11 candidates Obama endorsed for the House of Delegates, Obama won 7 of them\u2013and the GOP won 4\u2013and went just over 60 percent there. The losses by the Obama-endorsed candidates came even as\u00a0many led their Republican opponents handily in campaign contributions. Missy Cotter Smasal, a small business owner from Virginia Beach, Va., raised $550,000 more than the incumbent Republican she was vying to unseat, according to the Virginia Public Access Project (VPAP). Some of those funds came from top Obama donors like Michael Bills, who along with his donated more than $130,000 to Smasal\u2019s campaign, and groups allied with the former president, including Everytown for Gun Safety.\u00a0The cash lead did not translate to votes tough, as Rodman lost to the incumbent by five percentage points. There is also some evidence that victories by the two Obama-endorsed senate candidates result from factors beyond the former president\u2019s control. In Senate District 10, Ghazala Hashmi defeated incumbent Republican Sen. Glen Sturtevant by slightly more than 8,000 votes after an expensive campaign in which both candidates raised more than two million each. Sturtevant, who won the seat in 2015, was considered the Senate\u2019s most vulnerable Republican because his district, which includes portion of the city of Richmond, is heavily Democratic. According to the VPAP, the 10th Senate District voted for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton over President Donald Trump by a margin of 53 percent to 41 percent in 2016. The district has only grown to favor Democrats in the years since, voting for Gov. Ralph Northam (D-VA) by a 15 percentage points in 2017 and for Kaine by 24 percentage points in 2018. A similar situation played out in Senate District 13 where Obama\u2019s endorsed candidate, John Bell, won an open seat. Bell, who represented portions of the district in the Virginia House of Delegates, easily bested his Republican opponent, the Trump-endorsed Geary Higgins, by more than 7,000 votes. The results were not that surprising given Bell\u2019s fundraising advantage\u2014$2.1 million to Higgins\u2019 $1.3 million\u2014and the district\u2019s Democrat lean. In 2016, Clinton carried it by a margin of six percentage points. Meanwhile, Northam carried it by 11 percentage points on his way to the governorship in 2017 and Kaine won it overwhelmingly by 18 points last year. Although both victories helped ensure Democrat control of the state senate, losses by the four other Obama-endorsed candidates, like Smasal, means the party is likely to only have a one seat majority in the chamber. The former president had more luck with the candidates he endorsed for the Virginia House of Delegates, albeit still failed to see them all elected. In total, six of the 11 Democrats that Obama backed won, while four lost. One race is still outstanding, but the Republican candidate is leading. As with the senate races, there were a bevy of factors behind the results. Two of the candidates Obama threw his support behind, Delegates Hala Ayala and Kelly Convirs-Fowler, were incumbents running for reelection. Both women led the money race by heavy margins, with Ayala raising nearly a million dollars more than her Republican challenger, and were running in territory favorable to Democrats. In fact most of the districts Obama-endorsed candidates won and lost were carried by Clinton in 2016 and Kaine in 2018. Some, like House District 28 in Northern Virginia, were carried by Democrats on Tuesday by small margins than in prior years. In 2016, Clinton won the district by four percentage points, before Kaine carried it by 12 points on his way to reelection last year. On Tuesday, though, the Obama-endorsed Joshua Cole only won the district by a slim margin of roughly four percentage points. A comparable political environment existed in House District 100 on Virginia\u2019s eastern shore, an area that has become increasingly friendly to Democrats in recent years. Even though Kaine won the district by 12 points in his 2018 reelection bid, the Obama-endorsed candidate, Phil Hernandez, failed to unseat the longtime Republican incumbent, Rob Bloxom. Hernandez\u2019s three point loss was especially surprising given that he had out-raised\u00a0Bloxom by more than $500,000. The failure of Obama-backed candidates like Hernandez\u2019s ensures that Democrats will have a slim majority in the Virginia House of Delegates next session. In a twist of irony, the Democrats narrow majority could end up slowing the very advancements in \u201cequality, justice, and decency\u201d the former president invoked when issuing his endorsements last week.",

      "author": "Matthew Boyle",
      "content": "Businessman Eddie Rispone, the GOP candidate for governor, is experiencing a surge of support from Republicans statewide unifying behind his candidacy as he rises in the polls in what is shaping up to be a tight photo finish on the bayou. After getting into the runoff back in the October 12 jungle primary, Rispone has quickly unified Republicans in Louisiana behind his campaign, bringing in most of the senior team behind his chief GOP rival Rep. Ralph Abraham (R-LA) during that round. Abraham quickly endorsed Rispone that night as he conceded the race, and now,\u00a0his team is working to ensure Rispone is victorious in the Louisiana gubernatorial runoff on Saturday, November 16. Incumbent Democrat Gov. John Bel Edwards, meanwhile, has turned to national Democrats like former President Barack Obama and failed 2016 Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2019s team for help. Edwards\u2019 team is also internally fighting, sources with knowledge of the matter say, over control of the message and reins of the campaign as these new national Democrats with Clinton ties fly into Louisiana to work for his team in the home stretch after he underperformed expectations back on October 12. As Breitbart News reported, Edwards has brought in veteran Hillary Clinton Democrat staffer Scott Arceneaux in the runoff to help with his campaign in the final home stretch. What\u2019s more, former President Obama recorded a robocall for Edwards on election day back on October 12 urging Louisiana voters to \u201cget out and vote for Gov. John Bel Edwards.\u201d Lionel Rainey, a top adviser previously to Abraham who is now working for the Republican Governors Association (RGA) to elect Rispone as the GOP unifies in the state, told Breitbart News that the contrast between both sides could not be clearer.\n\n\u201cConservatives are uniting and Democrats are infighting over who\u2019s getting paid,\u201d Rainey said. \u201cJohn Bel\u2019s team is fractured and in full-blown panic mode. They\u2019re desperate. It\u2019s almost sad to watch it happening. You could see it in the governor\u2019s performance during the debate. \u201cConfident\u201d would not be an adjective I would use to describe it. They know it\u2019s coming to an end, and they can\u2019t handle it. And President Trump hasn\u2019t even come back in yet for the runoff. They might have a seizure when he takes the stage before Election Day. There\u2019s a red wave coming in Louisiana. We\u2019re going to take back the governor\u2019s seat and have a supermajority of conservatives in the Statehouse and Senate. The days of Louisiana finishing last are coming to an end. It\u2019s exciting.\u201d President Donald Trump is headed to Louisiana on Wednesday night to campaign again for Rispone. He appeared before the October 12 jungle primary alongside both Rispone and Abraham back then, urging Louisiana voters to back either one in the October 12 race to keep Edwards under 50 percent and force this runoff. Rispone made it to the runoff, lining up the battle that is coming up next week. Trump has been very active in the race, weighing in repeatedly to help Rispone too:     One of the key strategies of Edwards\u2019 team in the home stretch has been to try to divide Abraham and Rispone supporters in the runoff, to keep Rispone from coalescing enough support to get over the top. On October 12, Edwards finished with an abysmal 46.6 percent, Rispone got 27.4 percent, and Abraham got 23.6 percent\u2014for a combined GOP total of 51 percent. But Edwards\u2019 strategy is not working particularly well, GOP sources in the state say, because of how quickly and swiftly Abraham and his team have rallied behind Rispone. Part of the reason why Trump is heading to Monroe, Louisiana, in the northern part of the state\u2014Abraham\u2019s congressional district and his turf\u2014on Wednesday night is that Abraham personally called the president and asked him to come there specifically to help Rispone. Abraham confirmed this in a tweet last week when the rally was announced:  With Tuesday\u2019s likely loss in Kentucky\u2019s governor\u2019s race\u2014the Associated Press still has not called the race, but Republican incumbent Gov. Matt Bevin trailed by several thousand votes to Democrat Attorney General Andy Beshear in a race Bevin has as of now not conceded\u2014the stakes in Louisiana get higher heading into next week. The Louisiana race offers Republicans an opportunity for redemption and the ability to legitimately claim that Kentucky was a one-off and not a trend nationally against Republicans.",

Family Under Media Scrutiny And as if it were not enough for this family to face, the tides turned against Richard and Audrey when they attempted to change state law to put into place due process in Title IX investigations, including allowing those facing sexual misconduct charges to have an attorney and access to case findings. \u201cWe don\u2019t want another family to have to go through this,\u201d Audrey told Breitbart News. Ironically, it was the parents\u2019 effort to help their son that led to what they said amounted to the university and local media vilifying the whole family. The story includes Audrey and Richard\u2019s vocations, which allowed them \u2014 more easily than most parents \u2014 to try to bring change to the Title IX process in Missouri; she is a judge on the state\u2019s Administrative Hearing Commission, and he is a lobbyist who works with members of the State House and Senate. The next chapter of the story is Washington University sharing confidential information with lawmakers. Then the media claimed that House Bill 573 was crafted and promoted solely to help their son even though his fate was sealed, including the rejection of his appeal of the Title IX decision. Media reports claimed a retroactive component of the bill, had it become law, would have benefited their son, who by that time had already enrolled in another school. Local and eventually national media blew up the story, reporting that the McIntoshes had only personal reasons for backing the bill. The Kansas City Star reported: Had McIntosh\u2019s 2018 amendment been enacted, it would have allowed his son to appeal the result of his Title IX hearing to the state Administrative Hearing Commission, where his mother and McIntosh\u2019s wife, Audrey Hanson McIntosh, is the presiding and managing commissioner. The initial version of McIntosh\u2019s House bill from this session would have allowed those suspended or expelled for Title IX violations, including those like his son, whose case had already been decided, to appeal their punishments to the same administrative court where McIntosh\u2019s wife sits. The Associated Press (AP) distributed a story nationwide based on a Freedom of Information Act request that produced emails between Richard and lawmakers. Like the Star, AP claimed the bill was designed to help his son: The emails, obtained through an open-records request, show that lobbyist Richard McIntosh sent detailed edits last year to legislative staffers writing the House version of the Title IX overhaul. One edit that appears to be from McIntosh recommends adding \u201cspecific language allowing decisions prior to this legislation to be reviewed.\u201d That would enable McIntosh\u2019s son to appeal his expulsion to a state panel on which his mother sits. Legislation Explained Richard provided the facts for inclusion in this report: The bill as originally filed contained two distinct and difference aspects related it to the Administrative Hearing Commission\u2019s authority on Title IX cases.The bright line for the application of this authority was for Title IX decisions issued by a university before August 28, 2019 and for Title IX decisions issued after August 28, 2019.\u00a0 Under the Missouri Constitution, new legislation takes effect August 28 in the year that it was passed. For Title IX case decisions which were handed down by a university before August 28th, the respondent in a Title IX case could ask the Administrative Hearing Commission to review whether due process was applied in the case and a correct decision was reached based on all available evidence.\u00a0 The Administrative Hearing Commission was limited to issuing a ruling regarding the propriety of the decision.\u00a0 This opinion did not have the force and effect of law, so this opinion could not change the decision, discipline or outcome of an existing Title IX case.\u00a0 It only allowed the respondent to be able to say that an independent third party had reviewed the case and determined that due process was or was not applied in the case.\u00a0This statutory provision allowed those students whose family did not have $250,000 to spend on a federal lawsuit the ability to at least raise the issue that due process had not been applied and that perhaps the correct decision was not reached.\u00a0 Because Missouri constitution does not allow retroactivity, the Administrative Hearing Commission opinion was only advisory. For Title IX case decisions which were handed down by a university after August 28th, either party to the case could ask the Administrative Hearing Commission to review the case and determine if the correct decision was reached based on all evidence and subsequently if due process had been applied in the case.\u00a0 The Administrative Hearing Commission could render a decision overturning the university\u2019s Title IX decision based on the evidence presented to them or could uphold the decision.\u00a0Under this provision, the Administrative Hearing Commission\u2019s decision would have the full force and effect of law.\u00a0 Once again, the Administrative Hearing Commission was a much less expensive option for providing oversight on Title IX decisions reached by a university without the need to go to federal court. \u201cAs the bill language relates to the McIntosh family, in either circumstance, before or after, there was no way for the McIntosh family to bring a case in front of the Administrative Hearing Commission,\u201d Richard said.\u00a0\u201cFirst, under the rules of ethics for attorney\u2019s there was no way for Audrey to hear a family members case.\u201d \u201cFurthermore, because of her relationship with the other Administrative Hearing Commissioners, they would have to recuse themselves from any case brought in front of the Administrative Hearing Commission related to the McIntosh family,\u201d Richard said. \u201cThe McIntosh family literally has no remedy available to it front of the Administrative Hearing Commission for any type of case, whether it was Title IX or any other decision rendered by an administrative body of Missouri state government,\u201d Richard said. \u201cFor instance, if the Department of Revenue issued a finding against a member of the McIntosh family, no one on the Administrative Hearing Commission could hear the case.\u201d The McIntoshes told Breitbart News that the bill they supported, which never made it past committee, is rendered dead unless or until it or some version of it is introduced in the next state legislation session, which begins in January. Moreover, the McIntoshes want changes made to the Title IX process to make it more accountable and transparent for all parties. Thousands Face Title IX Cases And, in fact, their son\u2019s case is anything but unique. There is a massive online subscription-based database, Title IX for All, that\u2019s devoted to keeping track of the \u201c1,000 plus\u201d lawsuits filed by respondents in higher education Title IX proceedings. Nicholas H. Wolfinger,\u00a0 a professor of Family and Consumer Studies and Adjunct Professor of Sociology at the University of Utah, wrote about his own experience with Title IX: Much of the emerging backlash concerns false accusations of sexual misconduct. Consider some of the campus rape cases to have received the most media attention over the past decade: the Duke lacrosse players (2006), the University of Virginia assault reported in Rolling Stone (2014), Emma Sulkowicz, the Columbia University \u201cmattress girl\u201d (2012), and the Baylor athletic department sexual assault cover-up scandal (2015-2016). The Duke lacrosse and Rolling Stone accusations have been incontrovertibly debunked; the Sulkowicz accusation is almost certainly unfounded. Only the Baylor case, in which the football coach, athletic director, and university president were all fired for systematically suppressing rape allegations, actually reflected sexual misconduct. Colleges and universities are themselves contributing to the proliferation of false accusations. Ironically, these false accusations have ensued from a misguided policy intended to protect the interests of rape survivors: the 2011 Department of Education directive known as the \u201cDear Colleague\u201d letter. My own Title IX investigation was also largely based on words. In 2016, I was brought up on charges that included, most memorably, telling a few colleagues that I\u2019d proposed to my now ex-wife at a strip club. The complaint also cited various instances of \u201cpotty mouth\u201d and bawdy conversation. Wolfinger concluded his commentary with the same plea as the McIntoshes: \u201cA civilized society has no place for men (and, occasionally, women) who abuse their power by abusing their subordinates. Accusations of sexual misconduct must always be taken seriously. At the same time, anyone who is accused deserves due process, not an internet lynch mob.\u201d And on Wednesday the Daily Wire reported on an autistic student, Marcus Knight, who was attending Saddleback College in California and was suspended in 2018 for giving a female student a \u201cfist bump\u201d and for taking a selfie with another women: His mother, Aurora Knight, started a GoFundMe account in an attempt to raise money for legal fees to fight Marcus\u2019 suspension. The suspension ended up being overturned, but the negative marks still appear on his transcript. As Aurora has said, Marcus never received a fair hearing. The investigator in his case had no formal training (though Title IX training is designed to find students responsible, so formal training likely would not have helped Marcus). No one testified against Marcus, yet he was found responsible. Marcus has resumed classes at the school but his mother said he has \u201cbeen robbed of two first years in college\u201d and that Marcus\u2019 \u201cdreams have crashed.\u201d As for the McIntoshes, their son is now in law school, a career that he may otherwise not have chosen if not for his own traumatic experience. This may not be the final chapter of the McIntosh story. They have a five-year window to sue Washington University. According to Dean Dohrman, Missouri state representative, he plans to introduce another bill to reform Title IX in the next session. Audrey said the university and the media failed to present the truth in her son\u2019s case. \u201cThey were making it about our son, not the political conversation about what\u2019s right to do and what\u2019s wrong,\u201d she said.

      "content": "President Barack Obama put DACA in place through executive action allowing hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants to remain and work in the United States if they were brought to the United States illegally by their parents, dubbed Dreamers. The \u201cCommon Ground\u201d exhibit, a joint effort of the Koch brothers-funded Americans for Prosperity, the Libre Institute and Stand Together, uses ten videos behind ten doors to send messages about how immigrants make America stronger. Behind Door Seven the video features U.S presidents promoting immigration, but Donald Trump is not one of them. \u201cYou can go to leave in France but you can\u2019t become a Frenchman,\u201d President Ronald Reagan says in the video. \u201cYou can go to live in Germany or Turkey or Japan but you can\u2019t become a German, a Turk or Japanese.\u201d \u201cBut anyone from any corner of the Earth can come to live in America and become an American,\u201d Reagan says. \u201cOur economy in stronger when we harness the talents and ingenuity of striving, hopeful immigrants,\u201d President Barack Obama says in the video. \u201cWe are a nation of immigrants but we are also a nation of laws,\u201d President Bill Clinton says in the video. \u201cAmerica can be a lawful society and a welcoming society at the same time,\u201d President George W.

The \u201cCommon Ground\u201d public art exhibit visited Washington, DC, last week to promote more immigration in the United States and in support of amnesty for those in the country illegally. (Penny Starr/Breitbart News) The messaging point in the exhibit are taken from various polls, which do not always reflect all factors about the role immigration plays in the United States, including impacts on the job market. Door 1: Meet Dreamers \u2013 3 in 5 Americans support both a solution for Dreamers and a more secure border Door 2: Outdated system \u2013 Nearly 70 percent of Americans believe we should improve our immigration system Door 3: American Hero \u2013 More than 60 percent of Americans agree that immigrants make the U.S. stronger Door 4: How Miami are You \u2013 A majority of Americans say that immigrants help the economy Door 5: Friendships and Bonds \u2013 93 percent of Americans agree that welcoming people from different cultures is an important aspect of the American way of life Door 6: Fighting to Stay \u2013 Americans are frustrated with our immigration system, with 65 percent saying it is broken Door 7: Shared Values \u2013 Over 75 percent off Americans believe that immigration is a good thing \u2014 a record high Door 8: We all benefit \u2013 2 out of 3 Americans say illegal immigration should stay or increase from current levels Door 9: The Nashville Way \u2013 Immigrants in Tennessee contributed $527,400,000 to the state economy Door 10: Nation\u2019s Capitol \u2013 75 percent of Americans believe that immigration is good for our country \u201cEveryone knows our immigration system isn\u2019t working. The American public wants to fix it and Common Ground: Immigration serves as a platform for productive dialogue,\u201d the exhibit website says. \u201cThe premise is simple yet profound: If we focus on areas of common ground, rather than areas of division, we bridge divides, build respect for one another, and unite to solve the most pressing problems of our time.\u201d The High Court hears oral arguments on DACA on Tuesday with a ruling expected in 2020.

      "subtitle": "Businessman Eddie Rispone, the GOP candidate for governor in Louisiana in next Saturday\u2019s runoff election, ripped leftist Democrat Gov. John Bel Edwards as \u201cbeholden\u201d to \u201ctrial lawyers\u201d in an exclusive interview with Breitbart News this weekend.",
      "author": "Matthew Boyle",
      "content": "Appearing on Breitbart News Saturday on SiriusXM 125 the Patriot Channel ahead of the all-important LSU-versus-Alabama football game that President Donald Trump is attending, Rispone laid out his case for why Louisiana should reject Edwards\u2019 leftist Democrat vision and instead install him\u2014a conservative businessman, like Trump\u2014as the state\u2019s next governor. \u201cIt\u2019s extraordinarily important. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to turn our state around,\u201d Rispone said. \u201cWe\u2019re last\u2014we\u2019ve been last now for several years. The governor doesn\u2019t want to admit that, but we\u2019ve been ranked last for the last three years in a row. It\u2019s an opportunity we can\u2019t pass up. We\u2019re going to have a conservative House and a conservative Senate, and what we need is a governor who\u2019s conservative\u2014an outsider, someone with serious business skills. Just as important, we need someone who\u2019s not beholden to special interests. This governor is completely beholden to the trial lawyers. He was one. He can\u2019t get anything done. He\u2019s killing thousands of jobs, literally thousands of jobs in the oil and gas industry. We have the second highest auto insurance in the country. It\u2019s killing jobs, and it\u2019s also just really hurting the middle and lower income families\u2014they can\u2019t pay the premiums. You have to make choices between rent and utilities and things of that nature. This just has to be done, it\u2019s an opportunity we can\u2019t pass up.\u201d President Trump has already done two rallies with Rispone\u2014one before the Oct. 12 runoff where Rispone edged out Rep. Ralph Abraham (R-LA) to face off against the Democrat Edwards in the Nov. 16 runoff, and the other last week during early voting\u2014and he is planning lots more to help Rispone. The topic is almost certainly going to come up during Trump\u2019s appearance at the LSU-Alabama game on Saturday afternoon, and Trump is likely headed back to Louisiana next week for another rally with Rispone. Rispone said that Edwards, through his Democrat policies, has been blocking the people of Louisiana from experiencing the full effect of the booming Trump economy because the state has been struggling under Edwards. Just this weekend, an editorial in the Wall Street Journal blasted Edwards for protecting trial lawyers like Edwards was before he was elected\u2014something that\u2019s been crushing economic opportunity in the state. \u201cThe president does really care about Louisiana and he\u2019s been here, that\u2019s why he\u2019s down here. He does want us to share in what I call the Trump wave,\u201d Rispone said. \u201cOur economy is the slowest in the south. I don\u2019t want to go through the litany of those things, but you asked what I\u2019m going to do\u2014immediately after I\u2019m sworn in, I\u2019m going to let the job creators know that we have someone who knows how to create jobs and has worked with job creators for 40 years and bring those jobs back but keep the jobs we have here. Our governor and his trial lawyer friends are killing thousands of jobs in the oil and gas industry alone. Twenty thousand jobs have left here, and we\u2019ve had over 70,000 citizens leave our state.\u201d If and when he is sworn in as governor, Rispone said, he\u2019s going to let industry know there\u2019s a \u201cdifferent sheriff in town\u201d who will stand up for jobs and the state\u2019s economy against special interests. \u201cSo, immediately, I\u2019m going to let the oil and gas industry know they\u2019ve got a different sheriff in town, someone who\u2019s going to go after these trial lawyers who are killing these thousands of jobs,\u201d Rispone said. \u201cI\u2019m not beholden to trial lawyers like he is. And we\u2019re going to fix this insurance that\u2019s killing thousands of jobs as well as costing our citizens a tax. I mean they\u2019re paying a thousand to two thousand dollars a year more, and it\u2019s really hurting the lower and middle income families. Immediately, we\u2019re going to go after this lawsuit abuse and fix that, and let them know we have a governor who understands job creation and is going to work for them to create jobs for our citizens. We should be number one in the south when it comes to jobs and opportunities, and we are last. I use this analogy: If LSU was last in the SEC, we\u2019d fire everyone from the president of the university down to the poor water boy. It\u2019s time we do the same thing in our state government. We\u2019re going to have a very conservative House and Senate, we need someone in the governor\u2019s seat who can work with them and move our state forward. That\u2019s very simple.\u201d Rispone added that he considers this trial lawyer \u201cabuse\u201d to be a force \u201cdestroying\u201d opportunity for hardworking families in Louisiana. \u201cIt\u2019s not only blocking [economic success],\u201d Rispone said. \u201cThey\u2019re destroying it. This lawsuit abuse, I\u2019m telling you, has driven out thousands of jobs in the oil and gas industry and cost us to lose hundreds of millions of dollars in tax revenues because we\u2019re not getting the oil and gas out of the ground.\u201d Rispone, a successful businessman who\u2019s hired thousands of people over his career, said he considers this election to be like a \u201cjob interview.\u201d \u201cYou mentioned something earlier comparing us. This is a job interview,\u201d Rispone said. \u201cWe have a $30 billion plus operation here in the state government. We have a liberal, tax-and-spend trial lawyer as our CEO. It\u2019s time to get someone who understands how to be a CEO, someone with serious business skills, and someone who knows how to recruit talented people. Someone who can get a plan together. Someone who can make it accountable, and understands all these things. It\u2019s time to do something different. He keeps appointing these political cronies over at these agencies, and they\u2019re not functioning like they should. They\u2019re not giving the citizens what they pay for. So, it\u2019s very easy: Just look at it like a resume. See which one you want as your CEO of a $30 billion operation\u2014it\u2019s someone who\u2019s not beholden to these special interests, and it\u2019s certainly not someone who\u2019s beholden to these trial lawyers who are killing thousands of jobs. I think it\u2019s a very simple observation to make.\u201d On top of all of Edwards\u2019 radical leftist policies standing in the way of economic success, Rispone said, he is \u201cone of them\u201d\u2014a card-carrying member of the institutional left and hard-left wing of the Democrat Party. \u201cHe was a super delegate for Hillary Clinton, right off the bat,\u201d Rispone said of Edwards. \u201cThen, what did he do? He allows New Orleans to be a sanctuary city. He does\u2014he says it\u2019s not, but they have a protest against ICE and he supports it and didn\u2019t come out against it. We all know that sanctuary cities encourage illegal immigration and we know we have crisis with illegal immigration and he just sits there and allows that to happen\u2014and then when they protest ICE, he didn\u2019t say a word. Sanctuary cities encourage illegal immigration and it\u2019s a threat to our safety and it eats up our hard-earned tax dollars. These people, he paid over $16 million in benefits to illegal immigrants. This guy is a liberal. Believe me, when it comes time next year to endorse whoever the idiot running against\u2014the lunatic, the leftist, socialist running against our president, he\u2019s going to endorse them. He is one of them. Then, on top of that, he\u2019s taking millions of dollars from all these socialist Democrats from around the country\u2014millions\u2014and he\u2019s going to say he\u2019s not one of them? Go tell somebody else that.\u201d As governor, if he is elected, Rispone said he will stop the taxpayer-funded welfare payments to illegal aliens and he will work to pass a law with the legislature to ban sanctuary cities like New Orleans in the state\u2014a law that every other state in the south has passed except for Louisiana because Edwards blocked the efforts to pass it. \u201cIt\u2019s very simple. Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Texas all have laws that if a city within the state does not cooperate with the immigration laws, they cut off state funding to that city,\u201d Rispone said. \u201cThey\u2019ve passed the laws. What they all have in common is a Republican governor. Our governor helped kill a bill that we tried to pass in a session, I don\u2019t know which one it was in the previous session, but we will have the same law. He supports sanctuary cities. He\u2019s a liberal. He\u2019s a radical liberal who tries to project that he\u2019s not. He cozies up to the president but then he\u2019s going to support whoever runs against this president, whichever liberal. He says he\u2019s not tied to the national party, but then he takes millions of their dollars to run for governor. Between the trial lawyers and the liberal Democrats, they have given him over $10 million for this campaign. Don\u2019t tell me he\u2019s not a liberal. He\u2019s completely beholden to them and he\u2019s one of them.\u201d Edwards has also brought in senior former Hillary Rodham Clinton campaign staff to run his campaign, used robocalls from former President Barack Obama\u2014who may be appearing in Louisiana for him in the home stretch\u2014and associated with people like House Financial Services committee chairwoman Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) and \u201cSquad\u201d member Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI). \u201cHe keeps doing that, and tries to get it out, but then when he\u2019s caught on it he says \u2018oh no, I didn\u2019t do that,\u2019\u201d Rispone said when asked about Edwards\u2019 association with such Democrats. \u201cIt\u2019s just like taxes. He had several special sessions to raise our taxes $5 billion. Thank God we fought him through seven special sessions\u2014it would have been $10 billion. But he\u2019s going to say that was a bipartisan situation. He sent letters to the elderly and the nursing homes, very confusing threatening letters that they would be kicked out of the nursing homes if we didn\u2019t raise taxes. That\u2019s the kind of guy this is. It\u2019s all about the fear mongering tactics to raise taxes. This is a typical, typical, liberal tax-and-spend playbook. Fear monger, fear monger, fear monger, fear monger, make promises and then once you get elected do nothing to make the state better. That\u2019s the way he\u2019s been doing it.\u201d What\u2019s more, Edwards released a whole bunch of career criminals\u2014including several violent ones\u2014from prison. \u201cThe whole process he went through, he wasn\u2019t interested in lowering the recidivism rate,\u201d Rispone said. \u201cHe was interested in getting as many people out of there so he could say he lowered the number incarcerated. He just rode it out terribly so. But the telling thing, on top of that, he had over 200 pardons and over 100 of those were violent criminals\u201416 of them were murderers, two of them were child molesters, and one of them was a rapist. One of those murderers he let out, the daughter of the victim had sent him a letter requesting that he do not do that\u2014he never responded to her. He never even reached out to the family of the victim. On the night of the debate, he kept denying it and saying \u2018I didn\u2019t do that, I didn\u2019t do that.\u2019 It\u2019s a fact. Sixteen murderers, two child molesters, and a rapist. He pardoned those, and got them out of prison. You can\u2019t deny that. That\u2019s what he is, he\u2019s a liberal.\u201d LISTEN TO BUSINESSMAN EDDIE RISPONE ON BREITBART NEWS SATURDAY: ",

Since then, Greta has sailed across the Atlantic and spoken at the U.N. about climate change, both events Clinton claims add to the mystification of male political leaders,\u00a0repeating a message she delivered in September when she gushed over Thunberg\u2019s emotional speech at the United Nations\u2019 Climate Action Summit, calling it \u201crequired viewing for every lawmaker.\u201d Now she has returned to the topic. \u201cIt\u2019s been fascinating to watch how scared a lot of grown up male leaders are of this young 16-year-old girl who speaks up about the threat of climate change,\u201d Clinton said in London. \u201cShe is a young women, so the idea that she is standing up and speaking out as effectively as she has just rattles all of the paradigms that people still live with.\u201d Clinton pointed to what she called, \u201cancient DNA imprinting\u201d that determines \u201c\u2018This is what women are supposed to do and this is what they are supposed to look like\u2019 and you are not supposed to be so pushy and aggressive \u2026 it is maddening how much that still operates.\u201d Elsewhere in the discussion, Clinton said she had \u201calways admired Britain\u201deven if the current state of politics confuses her. She added: \u201cI am, as a great admirer, concerned because I can\u2019t make sense of what is happening.\u201d she also said she found the same bafflement with U.S. politics. \u201cIn my own country as well. I don\u2019t understand it\u2026. It\u2019s hard to figure out exactly where you\u2019re headed.\u201d As for her own political heroes, Clinton said former U.S. President Barack Obama is a role model for modern men. \u201cI think Barack Obama was a very gutsy person but who worked so, so hard not to let it show,\u201d she said. \u201cHe knew the undercurrents that were working against him and he\u2019s been a great defender of women\u2019s rights and opportunities.\u201d",

      "author": "Neil Munro",
      "content": "\u201cIf the [judges] make a decision, it would have a huge impact,\u201d said John Miano, a lawyer who is seeking to end two of the many work-permit programs.\u00a0Prior presidents created the two programs, which allow U.S. companies and Indian managers in the United States to annually hire roughly 150,000 Indians for technology jobs sought by American graduates. The invite is on page 19 of a\u00a0\u201cReply Brief\u201d that DOJ sent to the Supreme Court on October 28. The court will hear the DACA case on November 12. The DOJ\u2019s brief narrows the department\u2019s prior 2018 claim that Section 1324a of federal law allows the administration to approve an unlimited number of work permits for foreigners: Section 1324a may have ratified extending work authorization to aliens who received deferred action on an individualized basis or pursuant to interstitial class-based deferred-action policies. \u2026 But it cannot reasonably be interpreted to have \u201cbr[ought] about [the] enormous and transformative expansion\u201d in the Secretary\u2019s authority that would be required to support conferring work authorization in conjunction with a deferred-action policy like DACA. The \u201cmay have ratified\u201d admission is a huge step back from a 2018 plea where the solicitor general wrote that the 1324a section permits: pre-existing DHS regulations [to] allow all deferred-action recipients to apply for employment authorization, enabling them to work legally and pay taxes. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324a(h)(3) (empowering the Executive Branch to authorize the employment of noncitizens). The new DOJ language threatens the many administration programs, which award more than one million work permits each year to foreigners. If the court strikes down those programs, it will open up many technology jobs to the American graduates who are now locked out by managers\u2019 favoritism for Indian workers.  \u201cThe government has given conflicting statements on what its authority is to grant aliens employment,\u201d said Miano, a lawyer with the Immigration Reform Law Institute. Miano\u2019s group favors less government inflation of the annual labor supply. He continued: The story keeps on changing whether they have the [1324a] authority to grant aliens work authority. That authority does not exist \u2014 Congress has never granted this vast authority, and even if it did, it would be unconstitutional because Congress is supposed to be the legislative body. We basically know the executive is now inventing immigration law. The Supreme Court needs to clarify the authority of the agencies. It is long overdue [because] the agencies just run amok and Congress does not do anything about it, and the courts do not do anything about it. A Texas appeals court blocked the 1324a work-permit claim when it blocked President Barack Obama\u2019s 2014 Deferred Action for Parents of Americans (DAPA) amnesty for the illegal-immigrant parents of U.S.-born children. The Texas court\u00a0said: For the authority to implement DAPA, the government relies in part on 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324a(h)(3), a provision that does not mention lawful presence or deferred action, and that is listed as a \u201c[m]iscellaneous\u201d definitional provision expressly limited to \u00a7 1324a, a section concerning the \u201cUnlawful employment of aliens\u201d\u2014an exceedingly unlikely place to find authorization for DAPA. The Supreme Court\u2019s DACA decision could settle the work-permit issue, especially if the judges recognize the weak legal claim, which justified the award of work permits to the DACA illegals, Miano said. The work programs were created or expanded by officials working for President George W. Bush and Obama. For example, Bush\u2019s secretary for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) expanded the Optional Practical Training (OPT) program, which allows hundreds of thousands of foreign students to get work permits by enrolling in U.S. colleges and universities. The OPT program and the companion Curricular Practical Training (CPT) program ballooned to\u00a0430,000 active work permits in 2017. That army includes tens of thousands of foreign graduates who were invited by Indians managers to take jobs at prestigious U.S. firms\u00a0\u2014 so cheating children of the U.S. professional class.\u00a0The minimal coverage of the OPT labor inflow by the established media program also helps to hide the massive scale of OPT fraud. Obama\u2019s deputies expanded the OPT program and also created the H4 EAD program in 2015, which offers \u201cEmployment Authorization Documents\u201d to the spouses of H-1B workers. The spouses are called \u201cH-4s\u201d because of the H-4 visa given to the spouses of H-1B visa workers. Most of the roughly 100,000 H4 EADs have been given to Indian spouses, allowing them to be hired by Indian managers \u2014 even when Americans are seeking the same jobs.\u00a0The program worsens job competition for U.S. tech professionals, a federal court decided November 8. In 2018, at least 1.97 million\u00a0work permits\u00a0\u2014 most lasting one year\u00a0 \u2014 were issued\u00a0to foreigners, according to data provided by DHS. The wave of work permits was issued via a diversity of mandatory and discretionary programs directed by Congress \u2014 but also by many\u00a0programs justified by the 1324a claim. The huge total provides roughly two work permit workers for every four Americans who turned 18 that year. The 2018 work permit total includes 328,000 work permits for DACA migrants, 54,000 permits for the wives of Indian H-1B visa-workers, 245,000 work permits for resident foreigners who merely ask for green cards \u2014 dubbed \u201cAdjustment of Status\u201d \u2014\u00a0 and 345,000 permits for migrants who ask for asylum. The work permit total does not include at least 150,000 new visa workers each year, including the 100,000 new H-1B workers who joined the existing population of roughly 750,000 H-1B workers. (USCIS) The courts are reluctant to protect Americans employees from the flow of cheap overseas workers, Miano said. For example, he has been fighting to overturn the OPT program for more than ten years, but the cases have been passed back and forth by various judges, he said. In his H4 EAD case, Miano just won an appeal that sends the case back to a judge to decide if the 1324a section allowed Obama\u2019s officials to create the H4 EAD program. Business groups have fought against every effort to reduce the inflow of foreign workers into Americans\u2019 jobs. For example, a group of companies sent a letter to DHS on November 8 protesting a proposal to delay the award of work permits to Central American migrants. Reuters reported the business groups\u2019 demand: \u201cWe are concerned that the proposed rule would hurt our ability to attract and retain talent,\u201d they wrote. \u201cMany of the undersigned companies already have asylum seekers in our workforce and many will have need to hire members of this population in the months ahead.\u201d \u2026 Christopher Miller, an activism manager with Ben & Jerry\u2019s, said in a statement that the company opposed the fee changes. \u201cThese policies are disappointing but not surprising from an administration that is doing everything it can to build walls and keep people out,\u201d he said. The Reuters article did not mention the corporations\u2019 interest in cheap labor or the migrants\u2019 impact on American employees and their families. In 2017, roughly 400,000 border-crossing migrants got work permits. The flood of new workers helps to suppress wages for Americans, boost revenue for real estate investors, and spur sales by retail companies. The letter was sent by Ben & Jerry\u2019s, DoorDash, Airbnb, Chobani, Western Union, and several other companies. The potential loss of the OPT and CPT programs is a big issue for the investors who formed FWD.us. The investors gain higher stock values because the program inflates the supply of workers, renters, and consumers.\u00a0In a November 5 post denouncing criticism of the OPT program, FWD.us wrote: Optional Practical Training (OPT) allows graduates to gain valuable hands-on experience and begin contributing their education and training to the U.S. immediately. Without OPT, most international graduates would have no choice but to leave the U.S. and contribute their skills to our global competitors. Protecting the option of OPT for international graduates is critical to attracting, educating and retaining promising talent from around the world. The loss of foreign labor would sharpen employers\u2019 competition for U.S. graduates and blue-collar workers, so boosting salaries and opportunities for Americans.  FWD.us employs ten DACA illegals to help its advocacy. Miano laughed when the FWD.us post was pointed out to him. \u201cThey\u2019re scared that we\u2019re reaching the endgame in the [OPT and H4 EAD] lawsuits,\u201d he said, adding that FWD\u2019s prior silence showed \u201cthey did not want to give credibility to them.\u201d FWD.us is helping to fund a media campaign and demonstrations that feature attractive DACA migrants. That sentimental bait has been snapped up by reporters around the country, so helping them avoid covering DACA\u2019s huge economic redistribution from American workers to investors and their migrant workers. Todd Schulte, the executive director of FWD.us, declined to respond to Breitbart News. The OPT program was expanded in 2008 by Bush\u2019s DHS secretary, Michael Chertoff,\u00a0according to Miano: Microsoft proposed this scheme to the Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff at a dinner party at the home of the owner of the Washington Nationals baseball team. (See pp. 229-230 in my book\u00a0Sold Out, co-authored with Michelle Malkin.) From there, DHS worked in absolute secrecy with industry lobbyists to craft regulations implementing Microsoft\u2019s plan. In a classic example of Washington cronyism, the first notice that DHS was even considering such regulations came when they were promulgated as a\u00a0fait accompli, without notice and comment, on April 8, 2008 (73 Fed. Reg. 18,944). Microsoft\u2019s founder, Bill Gates, is one of the founders of FWD.us, along with Brad Smith, Mark Zuckerberg, and a host of other wealthy West Coast investors. The company has joined the DACA lawsuit to protects its access to imported workers, according to an article\u00a0co-written by Smith, now Microsoft\u2019s president: Microsoft aims to make technology that empowers every person on the planet, and to do that, we need to better reflect the world we seek to serve. Our innovations thrive on diverse voices, experiences and perspectives. Attracting and retaining talented people from all over the country and the world helps our company and our economy grow. One of our Microsoft employees came to this country when he was only 4 months old. He has never known a home other than the United States. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science from California Polytechnic State University. Today, he works on one of the most important products that we create \u2014 our cloud computing service, Microsoft Azure. Microsoft and Princeton\u2019s challenge to the federal government\u2019s termination of DACA is part of our institutions\u2019 long-standing support of sound immigration policies. In a world where talent is mobile, we need to do everything we can to ensure that those who want to contribute and innovate are welcome here in the United States. In 2017, the company\u00a0employed roughly 1,000 foreign OPT workers in place of American technology graduates.  Immigration Numbers: Each year, roughly four million young\u00a0Americans join the workforce after graduating from high school\u00a0or a university. This total includes about 800,000 Americans who graduate with skilled degrees in business or health care, engineering or science, software, or statistics. But the federal government then imports about 1.1 million legal immigrants. It also adds replacement workers to a resident population of more than 1.5 million white-collar visa workers \u2014 including approximately one million H-1B workers and about 500,000 blue-collar H-2B, H-2A, and J-1 visa workers.\u00a0The government also prints more than\u00a0one million\u00a0work permits\u00a0for new foreigners, and it rarely punishes companies for employing illegal migrants. This policy of inflating the labor supply\u00a0boosts\u00a0economic growth and stock values for\u00a0investors. The stimulus happens because the extra labor ensures that employers do not have to compete for American workers by offering higher wages and better working conditions. The federal policy of\u00a0flooding\u00a0the market with cheap, foreign white-collar\u00a0graduates\u00a0and blue-collar\u00a0labor\u00a0shifts wealth from young\u00a0employees toward older investors. It also widens wealth gaps,\u00a0reduces\u00a0high-tech investment,\u00a0increases\u00a0state and local tax burdens, reduces\u00a0marriage\u00a0rates, and hurts children\u2019s schools and\u00a0college\u00a0educations. The cheap-labor economic strategy also\u00a0pushes\u00a0Americans away from high-tech careers, and it sidelines millions of marginalized Americans, including many who are now struggling\u00a0with drug addictions. The labor policy also\u00a0moves\u00a0business investment and wealth from the\u00a0Heartland\u00a0to the\u00a0coastal\u00a0cities,\u00a0explodes\u00a0rents and housing\u00a0costs, undermines suburbia,\u00a0shrivels\u00a0real estate values in the Midwest, and rewards investors for creating low-tech, labor-intensive\u00a0workplaces. But President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cHire American\u201d policy is boosting wages by capping immigration within a growing economy. The Census Bureau\u00a0said\u00a0September 10 that men who work full-time and year-round got an average earnings gain of 3.4 percent in 2018. The gain pushed their median salaries up to $55,291. Women gained 3.3 percent in wages, bringing their median salaries to $45,097 for full-time, year-round work.  ",

      "author": "Charlie Spiering",
      "content": "The campaign mobilized against Los Angeles Times reporter Evan Halper for mistakenly quoting Buttigig as referring to the \u201cfailures of the Obama era\u201d on the campaign trail, a quote weaponized by his political rivals to damage his campaign. The snafu prompted Buttigieg to recommit his support for the former president on Twitter. \u201cMy appreciation of the great leadership of Barack Obama comes from a very personal place,\u201d he wrote on Twitter.  But Buttigieg\u2019s line about the \u201cfailures of the old normal\u201d include former President Obama, which he reminds political audiences, led to the Trump presidency. The South Bend mayor also spoke about Obama during a conversation with journalist John Heilemann about his campaign. \u201cI also don\u2019t believe we can go back, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s going back to Obama, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s going back to Clinton,\u201d he said in a clip posted by Mediaite\u2019s Tommy Christopher on Twitter.  In November, Buttigieg even claimed he had more executive experience than Obama did in 2007 when he ran for president. \u201cHe had more national exposure sooner than I did. But then I have the benefit of executive experience. So I guess we\u2019re just different,\u201d he told the Atlantic. Since announcing his presidential campaign, Buttigieg has tried to emphasize the contrast with former Vice President Joe Biden (and current senators) by arguing to voters they are part of a \u201cnormal\u201d political system that produced President Donald Trump. \u201cWe are not going to be able to meet this moment by recycling the same arguments, policies, and politicians that have dominated Washington for as long as I have been alive,\u201d Buttigieg said in the first night of the Democrat presidential primary debates in July. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to summon the courage to walk away from the past and do something different.\u201d The effort to appear \u201cdifferent\u201d was part of Obama\u2019s emphasis in the 2007 Democrat presidential primary until his campaign finally caught fire in Iowa and won him the state. Buttigieg even compared his improbable run for president to Obama\u2019s campaign for president, during a speech at the\u00a0Liberty and Justice Celebration dinner\u00a0in Iowa. \u201cThe first time I came to this state was as a volunteer, to knock on doors for a presidential candidate \u2013 a young man with a funny name,\u201d he said. \u201cWe knew the stakes were high then. The stakes are colossal now.\u201d Commentators have observed that Buttigieg is clearly a student of Obama\u2019s\u00a0upset run against failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, by echoing the same rhetoric and offering a break from the past. While Buttigieg wants to break from candidates like former Vice President Joe Biden, he does not want to break from the Obama legacy that he hopes to inherit. It\u2019s a strange paradox of running against the establishment while sounding like the establishment \u2014 at least the politics that Obama established in 2007.",

      "author": "Haris Alic",
      "content": "When the impeachment frenzy began in September, the former vice president was still leading his Democrat rivals by solid margins, according to national and state polls. Weeks of revelations about\u00a0influence peddling\u00a0in the Obama-era State Department and the conflicts of interest between the former vice president\u2019s office and the business interests of his youngest son, Hunter, however, have taken their toll. This was first evidenced by the Biden campaign\u2019s fundraising troubles and has more recently been exhibited by the former vice president\u2019s slippage in the polls. Since starting this campaign in late-April, Biden has\u00a0dropped\u00a0from leading his fellow 2020 Democrats by as much as double digits in Iowa, New Hampshire, and Nevada. A poll released from Iowa in late-October\u00a0showed\u00a0the former vice president in fourth place, trailing not only Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Warren (D-MA), but also South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Since that time, two other polls have also shown Biden firmly in fourth place, according to polling data compiled by Real Clear Politics. A similar situation has played out in New Hampshire,\u00a0where Biden once led by more than\u00a015 percentage points, the former vice president has been eclipsed by neighboring state rival, Warren. In fact, Biden had not led Warren in the first primary state in any poll taken between mid-September and November.\u00a0 That trend was only broken on Monday when a Quinnipiac Poll found the former vice president with a four percentage point advantage over Warren in New Hampshire. Although Biden\u2019s campaign was quick to laud the poll as proof their campaign was rebounding, they failed to mention that the former vice president\u2019s lead was exactly within the margin of error. Biden has also faltered nationally in the race for the Democrat nomination, although to less of a degree. In the weeks after Biden first announced his campaign, he led the field by as much as\u00a032 percentage points. In comparison, a Quinnipiac Poll from October\u00a0found\u00a0the former vice president trailing Warren, 21 percent to 28 percent, respectively. A similar Quinnipiac Poll taken just before the most recent Democrat presidential primary, which most\u00a0pundits\u00a0agreed was not Biden\u2019s best performance, had seen Warren\u00a0leading\u00a0the former vice president more narrowly, 30 percent to\u00a0 27 percent. Several national polls from the past week continue to show Biden in decline. A Monmouth University poll conducted between October 30 and November 3, found the former vice president in a statistical tie with Warren, with both Democrats pulling 23 percent of the vote. Likewise, a poll conducted by The Economist and YouGov between November 3 through November 5 showed Biden with narrow one point advantage, well within the margin of error, over Warren. Not only are Biden\u2019s fortunes dropping in the race for the Democrat nomination, but his viability for the general election is also taking a hit. When Biden first entered the 2020 race, most polls had him leading the president by wide margins. In June, alone, a Quinnipiac Poll had Biden leading Trump in a head-t0-head matchup by 13 percentage points, 53 percent to 40 percent. Now the former vice presidents leads Trump narrowly, often within the margin of error. An Emerson poll conducted in October, indicated Biden only had a one percentage point advantage over Trump, 51 percent to 49 percent, in a hypothetical general election. The Morning Consult found a similar trend in its national polling data. In between June and October, Trump was able to cut Biden\u2019s lead in a potential general election by half. In June, the Morning Consult\u2019s poll found Biden with an 11 point advantage over the incumbent. The same poll conduct at the end of October found the former vice president only leading Trump by five percentage points. The president\u2019s ability came from improved numbers among women and voters between the ages of 18-to-29 years of age\u2014two demographic groups essential to a Democrat\u2019s retaking the White House in 2020. Biden\u2019s drop in the polls has occurred as his son\u2019s wheeling and dealing in Ukraine has come to for-front of the impeachment inquiry. The controversy started when Trump\u00a0suggested\u00a0the Ukrainian government probe how Hunter Biden secured an appointment to the board of directors of Burisma Holdings, an eastern European oil and gas Ukrainian government probe Hunter Biden\u2019s role with Burisma Holdings. The younger Biden joined the company in 2014 around the same time his father was appointed to oversee Obama administration policy in Ukraine. As Peter Schweizer, senior contributor at Breitbart News,\u00a0detailed\u00a0in his book\u00a0Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends, Hunter Biden secured the position, which\u00a0paid\u00a0as much as\u00a0$83,000 per month, despite having no background in energy or Ukraine. Adding to concerns is the fact that at the time Hunter Biden joined Burisma, the company was seen as actively courting Western leaders to prevent further scrutiny of its business practices. The same month Hunter Biden was tapped for the group\u2019s board, the government of Great Britain froze accounts belonging to Burisma founder Mykola Zlochevsky under suspicion of money laundering. Not only had Zlochevsky had his assets frozen in Great Britain, but the former Ukrainian minister of natural resources was also facing suspicions of public corruption at home. Zlochevsky would later be\u00a0charged\u00a0with corruption for using his ministerial office to approve oil and gas licenses to companies under his control. It is in the context of Burisma and Zlochevsky\u2019s legal troubles that Joe Biden\u2019s political influence has raised the most red flags. The former vice president has particularly drawn questions over his conduct in demanding the Ukrainian government fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, in 2016. Joe Biden, who has publicly\u00a0bragged\u00a0about the firing, reportedly threatened to withhold more than one billion\u00a0dollars in U.S. aid if the Ukrainian government did not remove Shokin. He has claimed the demand came from then-President Barack Obama, who had allegedly lost faith in the prosecutor\u2019s ability to tackle corruption. Unofficially, though, it was known that Shokin was investigating both Burisma and Zlochevsky for public corruption. It is uncertain if the probe extended to Hunter Biden, although Shokin has recently admitted that prior to his ouster he was\u00a0warned\u00a0to back off the matter. Regardless of what occurred, Shokin\u2019s successor, who is now himself being\u00a0investigated\u00a0for public corruption,\u00a0dropped the investigation into Burisma and Zlochevsky. Although the former vice president and his son have denied any wrongdoing, voters do not seem to be buying their arguments. A recent poll by the Associated Press found that 69 percent of Americans believe Hunter Biden\u2019s work on behalf of Burisma was inappropriate. Furthermore, a Harvard/Harris poll taken at the same time showed that a 51 percent of Americans think the younger Biden should return any money he made through his ventures in Ukraine.",

      "subtitle": "During oral arguments at the United States Supreme Court Tuesday on\u00a0 he future of the Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals (DACA) amnesty program, Justice Sonia Sotomayor injected politics into the discussion, saying President Donald Trump has said he would find a way to keep DACA recipients in the United States but has not done so.",
      "author": "Penny Starr",
      "content": "Sotomayor also addressed what other justices cited \u2014 the \u201creliance interests\u201d of DACA recipients, or how the government program has allowed illegal migrants to get Social Security numbers, drivers licenses, and work permits that they have come to rely on. Sotomayor said: I think my colleagues have rightly pointed [out] there\u2019s a whole lot of reliance interests that weren\u2019t looked at, including the very President of \u2014 current President telling DACA-eligible people that they were safe under him and that he would find a way to keep them here. And so he hasn\u2019t and, instead, he\u2019s done this. And that, I think, has something to be considered before you rescind a policy. \u201cRight,\u201d Solicitor General Noel Francisco said. \u201cNot just say I\u2019ll give you six months to do it,\u201d Sotomayer said, referring to Trump\u2019s past announcement that he would hold off on rescinding DACA for six months to allow Congress to come up with a legislative solution. \u201cAnd where is the political decision made clearly?\u201d Sotomayor said referring to the June 22, 2018 memorandum issued by Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen to explain why the department was rescinding DACA. \u201cThat this is not about the law; this is about our choice to destroy lives,\u201d Sotomayor said, directly expressing what she believed a ruling to end DACA would mean to those enrolled in it. The back and forth between the justices, Francisco and two attorneys who argued for DACA petitioners \u2014 attorney Ted Olson and Michael Mongan, Solicitor General at California Department of Justice \u2013 included more discussion about the impact the ruling would have on both DACA recipients and the future enforcement of federal immigration law. Olson and Mongan argued that the Trump administration did not provide a compelling reason for rescinding DACA, which came to the high court after differing results in lower court decisions on the matter. Francisco argued that DACA, put in place by President Barack Obama\u2019s executive action in 2012, was not legal or highly likely to be illegal and it also would \u201chamstring\u201d federal law enforcement from enforcing immigration law. But the heart of the case revolves around two issues: Can the courts review the government\u2019s rescission of the DACA program? And was the government\u2019s decision to rescind DACA \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), which sets standards for federal agency actions that are generally enforceable in the courts? The case analysis by Steven D. Schwinn of the University of Illinois Chicago John Marshall School of law noted that \u201cAs of 2017, when the government rescinded the program, there were nearly 700,00 active DACA recipients. Their average age was just under 24-years-old. Over 90 percent were employed and 45 percent were in school.\u201d Many of the groups submitting Amicus briefs in favor of DACA in perpetuity \u2014 or forever \u2014 were educational institutions and U.S. businesses who benefit from this demographic. The entities backing DHS were those groups that believe DACA is not constitutional and benefits those in the country illegally while threatening the employment and educational opportunities of citizens. A ruling in the case is expected in June 2020. These cases are Department of Homeland Security v. Regents of the University of California, No. 18-587, Trump v. NAACP, No. 18-588, and McAleenan v. Vidal, No. 18-589 in the Supreme Court of the United States. SCOTUS by Anonymous ACTwgl9 on Scribd  Follow Penny Starr on Twitter",

      "author": "Haris Alic",
      "content": "The former vice president, who has seen his fundraising numbers shrink and his\u00a0position in the polls falter since the start of the inquiry, went on the offense Tuesday with a series of actions designed to showcase his foreign policy background. Most notably, Biden\u2019s campaign announced the launch of a new television ad in Iowa highlighting the candidate\u2019s tenure on the world stage over the past 40 years. The ad, which is entitled \u201cMoment,\u201d attempts to portray Biden as the only political figure able lead during this \u201cdangerous\u201d period in which \u201cdictators and tyrants are praised,\u201d while \u201cour allies [are] pushed aside.\u201d The ad states over photos of global crises intermixed with images of the former vice president over the span of tenure in the Obama administration: This is a moment that requires strong, steady, stable leadership. We need someone tested, and trusted around the world. This is a moment for Joe Biden, a president with the experience to lead on day one.  The 30-second ad, which started airing across Iowa\u2019s broadcast markets on Tuesday, is part of a previously announced $4 million media buy in the state. To accompany its launch, the campaign also released a list of endorsements from more than 130 former foreign policy and national security officials. Listed among the endorsers are a bevy of career bureaucrats\u00a0from the administration\u2019s of former Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama. Many of those backing Biden had signed letters in 2016 warning that Trump\u2019s election would be a disaster for America\u2019s national security. The former vice president\u2019s campaign stated when announcing the endorsements on Tuesday: The size and breadth of today\u2019s cohort of endorsers highlight both the extreme threat that Donald Trump poses to our nation and our world, and the widespread belief among those who\u2019ve devoted their lives to keeping America safe that Biden is the candidate best prepared to step in as commander in chief. It is unclear, though, if either the ad or the newfound support will be enough to reverse the damage done to Biden\u2019s campaign. From the moment it became public that Trump\u00a0suggested\u00a0the Ukrainian government probe Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings in the country, the former vice president has struggled to explain the appearance of conflicts of interest. At the center of the controversy is how the younger\u00a0Biden secured an appointment to the\u00a0board of directors of Burisma Holdings, a Ukranian oil and gas conglomerate. As Peter Schweizer, senior contributor at Breitbart News,\u00a0detailed\u00a0in his book\u00a0Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends, Hunter Biden secured the position, which\u00a0paid\u00a0as much as\u00a0$83,000 per month, despite having no background in energy or Ukraine. Adding to the appearance of impropriety is the fact that\u00a0Hunter Biden joined Burisma at a time the company was seen as actively courting western leaders to prevent further scrutiny of its business practices. The same month the younger Biden\u2019s appointment was announced,\u00a0the government of Great Britain\u00a0froze\u00a0accounts belonging to Burisma founder Mykola Zlochevsky under suspicion of money laundering. Zlochevsky, a former Ukrainian minister of natural resources, would later be accused of\u00a0corruption\u00a0for using his office to approve oil and gas licenses to Burisma. Not only had Zlochevsky had his assets frozen in Great Britain, but the former Ukrainian minister of natural resources was also facing suspicions of public corruption at home. Zlochevsky would later be\u00a0charged\u00a0with corruption for using his ministerial office to approve oil and gas licenses to companies under his control. A Ukrainian official with strong ties to Zlochevsky admitted in October the only reason that Hunter Biden secured the appointment was to \u201cprotect\u201d the company from foreign scrutiny. The claim has credence given that at the time Joe Biden, as the sitting vice president, was tasked with leading the Obama administration\u2019s policy towards Ukraine in response to Russia\u2019s invasion of Crimea. It is in the context of Burisma and Zlochevsky\u2019s legal troubles that Joe Biden\u2019s political influence has raised the most red flags. The former vice president has particularly drawn questions over his conduct in demanding the Ukrainian government fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, in 2016. Joe Biden, who has publicly\u00a0bragged\u00a0about the firing, reportedly threatened to withhold more than one billion\u00a0dollars in U.S. aid if the Ukrainian government did not remove Shokin. He has claimed the demand came from then-President Barack Obama, who had allegedly lost faith in the prosecutor\u2019s ability to tackle corruption. Unofficially, though, it was known that Shokin was investigating both Burisma and Zlochevsky for public corruption. It is uncertain if the probe extended to Hunter Biden, although Shokin has recently admitted that prior to his ouster he was\u00a0warned\u00a0to back off the matter. Regardless of what occurred, Shokin\u2019s successor, who is now himself being\u00a0investigated\u00a0for public corruption,\u00a0dropped the investigation into Burisma and Zlochevsky. The shadowy history, accompanied by revelations that Burisma sought to leverage its ties to Hunter Biden for access to the Obama-era State Department, has impacted the former vice president\u2019s credibility on the world stage. In the case of most candidates, that would not matter much, as a majority of those running for the Democrat nomination have barely any foreign policy experience. For Biden, however, his time on the international stage is a central selling point of his campaign. Biden, who once chaired the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has trumpeted himself as the only candidate ready to manage national security and geopolitics on his first day in office. In countless Democrat presidential primary debates, the former vice president has used his foreign policy experience to one-up his Democrat rivals. Biden was also the first 2020 Democrat to elaborate on how his global vision differs from\u00a0 Trump\u2019s \u2018America First\u2019 agenda. The former vice president said in July during a widely publicized foreign policy address: The challenge of following this disastrous presidency will not be just to restore the reputation of our credibility. It will be to enact a forward-looking foreign policy for the world as we find it today and as we anticipate it will be tomorrow and years to come. All of that, however, has evaporated in the face of the impeachment inquiry and the spotlight on his son\u2019s foreign ties, forcing the former vice president to try to salvage his image through measures like those witnessed on Tuesday.",

      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
      "content": "The Atlantic chronicled Patrick\u2019s close relationship with former President Barack Obama Thursday, asserting Patrick is Obama\u2019s \u201crightful heir,\u201d \u201can actual longtime friend based on mutual affinities.\u201d That friendship was the basis for the decision by Patrick a decade ago to work to replace the high academic standards that gave Massachusetts its top ranking among states in the country with the Obama-incentivized Common Core State Standards. Common Core was sold as a social justice reform that \u2013 above all else \u2013 would close the achievement gap between largely white, middle-income students and the mostly black and Hispanic students from lower-income families. That effort has failed abysmally, as Peggy Carr, associate commissioner of the National Center for Education Statistics, lamented in October after the results of the Nation\u2019s Report Card assessments showed U.S. public school children have made \u201cno progress\u201d in reading or mathematics over the ten years. \u201cOver the past decade, there has been no progress in either mathematics or reading performance, and the lowest-performing students are doing worse,\u201d Carr said, according to\u00a0Education Week. \u201cIn fact,\u00a0over the long term in reading, the lowest-performing students\u2014those readers who struggle the most\u2014have made no progress\u00a0from the first NAEP administration almost 30 years ago.\u201d Jamie Gass, director of the Center for School Reform at the Boston-based Pioneer Institute, and Charles Chieppo, a senior fellow at Pioneer, wrote specifically about Common Core\u2019s effect on Massachusetts at the American Conservative in May. While the Bay State had been one of three states to make progress in closing the achievement gap between 1998 and 2009, the trajectory changed when Patrick pushed the legislature to adopt Common Core. Gass and Chieppo summarized: When the Obama administration kicked off its push to federalize public education by making adoption of Common Core English and math standards a condition of receiving federal grant money, Massachusetts acquiesced. It adopted the standards in 2010. Common Core cut the amount of classic literature, drama, and poetry that Massachusetts students study by 60 percent. The math standards, which Stanford University mathematics professor emeritus R. James Milgram called \u201cshopping cart math,\u201d no longer get students to algebra by eighth grade. Subsequent revisions also dumbed down the Bay State\u2019s science and U.S. history standards. In 2009, then-governor Deval Patrick\u2019s administration brushed aside the state law that required history to join English, math, and science as a high-stakes test. Instead he pushed new age fads, including educating the \u201cwhole child\u201d and vacuous \u201c21st-century skills.\u201d The results of Massachusetts\u2019 decision to adopt the education \u201creform\u201d known as Common Core came fast. Though the state remains among the top performing in the nation, state scores have \u201ceither stagnated or declined in both English and math,\u201d wrote the Pioneer authors. \u201cIn the Common Core era, the Bay State was among those that saw the biggest declines in math,\u201d they observed. As might have been predicted, however, in January 2015, Obama-era Education Secretary Arne Duncan gave a glowing tribute to Patrick in an op-ed at the Boston Globe, praising the outgoing governor, claiming the state of Massachusetts had led the nation in education under the direction of the Common Core champion Patrick. \u201cIn many ways, Massachusetts is now helping to lead the country where it needs to go in education,\u201d Duncan said. However, Pioneer\u2019s executive director Jim Stergios countered in an op-ed, also at the Globe. \u201cWho says Common Core advocates don\u2019t like fiction?\u201d Stergios challenged. \u201cUS Education Secretary Arne Duncan got one fact right: Massachusetts leads the nation in education. Attributing that progress to Governor Patrick\u2019s leadership is like suggesting that a pinch runner who finds himself on third base hit a triple.\u201d Stergios noted Massachusetts had held the highest spot in all subjects on national assessments for a decade, and that prior to Patrick\u2019s inauguration in 2007, the state had already been identified as \u201cone of the fastest improving states in the nation.\u201d In addition, just several months into that year, Massachusetts students had been ranked on international math and science assessments with the top six countries. \u201cOnly a politician, or an education secretary playing one, would attribute Massachusetts\u2019 success to Patrick,\u201d Stergios asserted.\u00a0\u201cThe best one can say about overall student achievement in the Commonwealth during Patrick\u2019s terms in office is that it has been stagnant.\u00a0An objective observer would note significant areas of decline.\u201d The Pioneer executive director noted that, since the Common Core\u2019s adoption in Massachusetts, \u201csampled national tests show fourth-grade reading scores, the best predictor of future success, falling more significantly in Massachusetts than anywhere else in the country.\u201d The state\u2019s SAT scores had dropped 20 points during Patrick\u2019s tenure as well though, prior to becoming governor, the SAT scores had \u201crisen for 13 consecutive years.\u201d Yet another reason to question Duncan\u2019s praise for Patrick\u2014and the Common Core standards\u2014was Stergios\u2019 observation that, prior to 2007, \u201c67 percent of third graders scored advanced or proficient on the state\u2019s third-grade reading tests\u2026 that number is now 57 percent.\u201d Stergios wrote Patrick\u2019s decision to join the Obama administration in its push for Common Core led to the governor\u2019s desertion of \u201ctwo pillars of Massachusetts\u2019 original, bold reforms \u2014 academic content standards that approached those in the highest-performing nations and a unique accountability system focused on improving district leadership and performance.\u201d",

Stay informed about the truth Trump and his special interests are trying to distract from. Despite the lofty goal, the website has the appearance of a campaign ad rather than a fact sheet. Rather than addressing the alleged conflicts of interest between Hunter and Joe Biden head on, the site\u00a0attempts to pass off the opinions of partisan figures, like former Obama administration speechwriter Jon Favreau, as \u201cfacts.\u201d Added to the mix is that half the front page is devoted to television ads the Biden campaign has recently launched, most of which deal in generic campaign themes. The site also seems to have been thrown together hastily. An outside search by Breitbart News was able to confirm the website\u2019s domain was only purchased\u00a0on November 5, a little more than a week before the House Intelligence Committee was set to begin its impeachment inquiry. The quick timeline was evidenced by a number grammatical errors still visible hours after launch. The site reads when elaborating on why the former vice president is running: At this defining moment in our nation\u2019s history, it\u2019s going to take Joe Biden\u2019s strong leadership to defeat Donald Trump and unite America overseas, separating families at the border, protecting corporations and the wealthy over the middle class,\u00a0and threatening our democracy by pressuring foreign nations to interfere in our elections.  It is unclear what the Biden campaign was attempting to say with that paragraph. Requests for comment were not returned by press time. The website\u2019s launch comes only one day after the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump held its first first public hearing. Even though the hearing was built up as a history-making event\u2014only the fourth time in history Congress has weighed impeachment against a sitting president\u2014it largely backfired on Congressional Democrats. Most notably, one of the Democrats\u2019 star witnesses inadvertently made the argument that Hunter Biden\u2019s work for Burisma should be probed because of the appearance of conflicts of interest and the company\u2019s general perception of being corrupt. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent, who is vital to the Democrats proving Trump\u2019s conduct rose to the level of impeachment, admitted under oath that\u00a0U.S. officials had been urging the Ukrainian government for some time to explain why an investigation into Burisma was shut down. The state department official further admitted he and his colleagues believed Burisma\u2019s founder, Mykola\u00a0Zlochevsky, \u201chad stolen money,\u201d and the Ukrainian prosecutor charged with investigating him shut down the case after taking a bribe. Kent answered when asked if he was in favor of reopening the probe into Bruisma and Zlochevsky: I think since U.S. taxpayer dollars are wasted, I would love to see the Ukrainian prosecutor general\u2019s office find who the corrupt prosecutor was that took the bribe and how much was paid. Kent also asserted that Burisma had a \u201cmixed business reputation,\u201d and Hunter Biden\u2019s decision to join its board of directors had led him to raise concerns with former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s office in 2015. \u201cIn a briefing call with\u2026the office of the Vice President\u2026I raised my concern that Hunter Biden\u2019s status as a [Burisma] board member could create the perception of a conflict of interest,\u201d Kent testified. At the center of controversy is how and why Hunter Biden secured the appointment, which at times paid more than $83,000 a month. As Peter Schweizer, senior contributor at Breitbart News, detailed in his\u00a0book,\u00a0Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends, Hunter Biden had no prior experience with either the energy industry or Ukraine before joining Burisma in April 2014. Adding to concerns is the fact that, at the time Hunter Biden joined Burisma, the company was seen as actively courting western leaders to prevent further scrutiny of its business practices. The same month Hunter Biden was tapped for the group\u2019s board, the government of Great Britain\u00a0froze\u00a0accounts belonging to Zlochevsky under suspicion of money laundering. Zlochevsky, a former Ukrainian minister of natural resources, would later be accused of\u00a0corruption\u00a0for using his office to approve oil and gas licenses to companies under his control. A Ukrainian official with strong ties to Zlochevsky admitted in October the only reason that Hunter Biden secured the appointment was to \u201cprotect\u201d the company from foreign scrutiny. The claim has credence given that at the time, Joe Biden, as the sitting vice president, was tasked with leading the Obama administration\u2019s policy towards Ukraine in response to Russia\u2019s invasion of Crimea. It is in the context of Burisma and Zlochevsky\u2019s legal troubles that Joe Biden\u2019s political influence has raised the most red flags. The former vice president has particularly drawn questions over his conduct in demanding the Ukrainian government fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, in 2016. Joe Biden, who has publicly\u00a0bragged\u00a0about the firing, reportedly threatened to withhold more than one billion\u00a0dollars in U.S. aid if the Ukrainian government did not remove Shokin. He has claimed the demand came from then-President Barack Obama, who had allegedly lost faith in the prosecutor\u2019s ability to tackle corruption. Unofficially, though, it was known that Shokin was investigating both Burisma and Zlochevsky for public corruption. It is uncertain if the probe extended to Hunter Biden, although Shokin has recently admitted that prior to his ouster he was\u00a0warned\u00a0to back off the matter. Regardless of what occurred, Shokin\u2019s successor, who is now himself being\u00a0investigated\u00a0for public corruption,\u00a0dropped the investigation into Burisma and Zlochevsky. Biden\u2019s new website, though, made no mention of those facts on Thursday. Instead the website points to a handful of tweets backing up the former vice president\u2019s side of the story, including the one from Favreau. \u201cA reminder that Joe Biden\u2019s push to get the corrupt Ukrainian prosecutor fired, which was the position of the U.S. government and basically the entire global community, was a move that INCREASED the chances that Burisma would be investigated,\u201d the former Obama speech writer stated.",

Pressley veered from her colleagues, throwing her weight behind Warren, who has also proposed ultra-far left proposals, including Medicare for All and an \u201cUltra-Millionaire\u201d tax. Obama continued, according to the Times: I don\u2019t think we should be deluded into thinking that the resistance to certain approaches to things is simply because voters haven\u2019t heard a bold enough proposal and if they hear something as bold as possible then immediately that\u2019s going to activate them. \u201cFor those who get stressed about robust primaries, I just have to remind you I had a very robust primary,\u201d Obama added. \u201cI\u2019m confident that at the end of the process we will have a candidate that has been tested.\u201d Obama has yet to throw his support behind any of the current Democrat candidates, including his former running mate and vice president Joe Biden (D). Obama ally Deval Patrick (D), former governor of Massachusetts, recently jumped into the race \u00ad\u2013 a move Breitbart News\u2019s John Nolte described as a slap in the face to Biden: Well, Patrick and Obama\u00a0are close. In fact, Obama tried to talk Patrick into running last year, but was turned down. Patrick feared the ugliness of the race, his wife was ill, and he was probably thrilled to be making a pile of money giving women cancer. But Patrick is getting in now, isn\u2019t he? And it is more than fair to assume he\u2019s getting in because Obama begged him to. The reasons are obvious\u2026 As is being reported everywhere, the smoke-filled-room fellas, the leaders of the Democrat Party, the money men, the Obamas, etc., are terrified of Warren\u2019s socialistic tendencies, know Buttigieg is too young and too gay\u2026 But most of all they know Old Joe Biden just doesn\u2019t have the stuff. To be fair, Slow Joe never had the stuff. He\u2019s always been a terrible presidential candidate, and there are reports Obama tried to discourage him from running. Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, another major Obama figure, is also reportedly considering a longshot presidential bid, further adding to the growing belief that establishment Democrats \u2013\u00a0Obama and Hillary Clinton included \u2013\u00a0are increasingly worried by what the current Democrat field has to offer.",

      "subtitle": "Eric Ciaramella, whom Real Clear Investigations suggests is the likely so-called whistleblower, received emails about Ukraine policy from a top director at George Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundations.",
      "author": "Aaron Klein",
      "content": "The emails informed Ciaramella and a handful of other Obama administration foreign policy officials about Soros\u2019s whereabouts, the contents of Soros\u2019s private meetings about Ukraine and a future meeting the billionaire activist was holding with the prime minister of Ukraine. A primary recipient of the Open Society emails along with Ciaramella was then-Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs Victoria Nuland, who played a central role in the anti-Trump dossier affair. Nuland, with whom Ciaramella worked closely, received updates on Ukraine issues from dossier author Christopher Steele in addition to her direct role in facilitating the dossier within the Obama administration. The emails spotlight Soros\u2019s access to national security officials under the Obama administration on the matter of Ukraine. In one instance, Jeff Goldstein, senior policy analyst for Eurasia at the Open Society Foundations, sent a June 9, 2016 email to Nuland and Ciaramella, who were the missive\u2019s primary recipients. CC\u2019d were three other State Department officials involved in European affairs, including Alexander Kasanof who worked at the U.S. embassy in Kiev. The message read: I wanted to let you know that Mr. Soros met with Johannes Hahn in Brussels earlier today. One of the issues he raised was concern over the decision to delay the visa liberalization for Georgia and the implications for Ukraine. The email revealed that \u201cGS\u201d \u2013 meaning Soros \u2013 \u201cis also meeting [Georgian] President [Giorgi] Margvelashvili today and speaking with PM Groyman,\u201d referring to Ukrainian Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman. The email stated that Soros told Hahn \u201cthat Ukrainian civil society is concerned that without reciprocity from the EU for steps Ukraine has taken to put in place sensitive anti-corruption and anti-discrimination legislation and institutions it will not be possible to continue to use the leverage of EU instruments and policies to maintain pressure for reforms in the future.\u201d Soros also \u201curged Hahn to advocate with member states to move ahead with visa liberalization for Ukraine,\u201d the email related. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve been working this issue hard; if you have any thoughts on how this is likely to play out or where particular problems lie I\u2019d appreciate if you could let us know,\u201d the email concluded. Goldstein\u2019s email text sent to Nuland and Ciaramella was not addressed to any one individual. Nuland replied that she would be happy to discuss the issues by phone. Goldstein set up a phone call and wrote that Soros specifically asked that an employee from the billionaire\u2019s \u201cpersonal office\u201d join the call with Nuland. The email was released last August as part of a separate Freedom of Information Act request by the conservative group Citizens United.\u00a0 The FOIA request was unrelated to Ciaramella. Johannes Hahn, referenced in the emails as meeting with Soros about Ukraine, is the European Commissioner for Neighborhood Policy and Enlargement Negotiations. In 2015, Hahn participated with Nuland in the YES Summit, which bills itself as \u201cthe leading public diplomacy platform in Eastern Europe.\u201d Another summit participant was Vadym Pozharskyi, a board advisor to Burisma, the Ukranian natural gas company at the center of the impeachment trial and the allegations related to Hunter and Joe Biden. On scores of occasions, Hahn was a featured speaker at roundtables and other events produced by the Atlantic Council think tank, which is funded by and works in partnership with Burisma. The Atlantic Council is also financed by Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundations and has been in the news for ties to various actors associated with the impeachment issue. In one of several instances,\u00a0Breitbart News reported, itinerary for a trip to Ukraine in August organized by the Atlantic Council reveals that a staffer on Rep. Adam Schiff\u2019s House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence held a meeting during the trip with Acting U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor, now a key witness for Democrats pursuing impeachment. The Schiff staffer is also an Atlantic Council fellow, while Taylor has evidenced a close relationship with the Atlantic Council. Breitbart News previously reported on other emails that show Ciaramella worked closely with Nuland. Nuland has come under repeated fire for her various roles in the anti-Trump dossier controversy. In their book, Russian Roulette: The Inside Story of Putin\u2019s War on America and the Election of Donald Trump, authors and reporters Michael Isikoff and David Corn write that Nuland gave the green light for the FBI to first meet with Steele regarding his dossier\u2019s claims. It was at that meeting that Steele initially reported his dossier charges to the FBI, the book relates. FBI notes cite career Justice Department official Bruce Ohr as saying that Nuland was in touch with Fusion GPS co-founder and dossier producer Glenn Simpson. Sen. John McCain, who infamously delivered the dossier to then-FBI Director James Comey, reportedly first dispatched an aide, David J. Kramer, to inquire with Nuland about the dossier claims. Meanwhile, looped into some other email chains with Ciaramella was then-Secretary of State John Kerry\u2019s chief of staff at the State Department, John Finer. An extensive New Yorker profile of Steele named Finer as obtaining the contents of a two-page summary of the dossier and eventually deciding to share the questionable document with Kerry. Finer reportedly received the dossier summary from Jonathan M. Winer, the Obama State Department official who acknowledged regularly interfacing and exchanging information with Steele, according to the report. Winer previously conceded that he shared the dossier summary with Nuland. After his name surfaced in news media reports related to probes by House Republicans into the dossier, Winer authored a Washington Post oped in which he conceded that while he was working at the State Department he exchanged documents and information with Steele. Winer further acknowledged that while at the State Department, he shared anti-Trump material with Steele passed to him by longtime Clinton confidant Sidney Blumenthal, whom Winer described as an \u201cold friend.\u201d Winer wrote that the material from Blumenthal \u2013 which Winer in turn gave to Steele \u2013 originated with Cody Shearer, who is a controversial figure long tied to various Clinton scandals. In testimony last year, Nuland made statements about a meeting at the State Department in October 2016 between State officials and Steele, but said that she didn\u2019t participate. At a June 2018 hearing, Sen. Richard Burr (R-NC) revealed contents of the State Department\u2019s visitor logs while he was grilling Nuland. At the hearing, Burr asked: \u201cI know you talked extensively with our staff relative to Mr. Steele. Based upon our review of the visitor logs of the State Department, Mr. Steele visited the State Department briefing officials on the dossier in October of 2016. Did you have any role in that briefing?\u201d \u201cI did not,\u201d Nuland replied. \u201cI actively chose not to be part of that briefing.\u201d \u201cBut were you aware of that briefing?\u201d Burr asked. \u201cI was not aware of it until afterwards,\u201d Nuland retorted. Nuland did not explain how she can actively chose not to be part of Steele\u2019s briefing, as she claimed, yet say she was unaware of the briefing until after it occurred. Nuland was not asked about the discrepancy during the public section of the testimony, which was reviewed in full by Breitbart News. Nuland previously served as chief of staff to Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott under Bill Clinton\u2019s administration, and then served as deputy director for former Soviet Union affairs. Nuland faced confirmation questions prior to her most recent appointment as assistant secretary of state over her reported role in revising controversial Obama administration talking points about the 2012 Benghazi terrorist attacks. Her reported changes sought to protect Hillary Clinton\u2019s State Department from accusations that it failed to adequately secure the woefully unprotected U.S. Special Mission in Benghazi. Likely \u2018whistleblower\u2019 A RealClearInvestigations report by investigative journalist and author Paul Sperry named Ciaramella as best fitting the description of the so-called whistleblower. Officials with direct knowledge of the proceedings say Ciaramella\u2019s name has been raised in private in impeachment depositions and during at least one House open hearing that was not part of the formal impeachment proceedings. Federal documents show Ciaramella also worked closely with Joe Biden and worked under Susan Rice, President Obama\u2019s national security adviser. He also worked with former CIA Director John Brennan, an anti-Trump advocate who has faced controversy for his role in fueling the questionable Russia collusion investigation.\u00a0 Rice participated in Russia collusion probe meetings and reportedly unmasked senior members of Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. Sperry cites former White House officials saying Ciaramella worked for Biden on Ukrainian policy issues in 2015 and 2016, encompassing the time period for which Biden has been facing possible conflict questions for leading Ukraine policy in light of Hunter Biden\u2019s work for Burisma. Mark Zaid and Andrew Bakaj, the activist attorneys representing the so-called whistleblower, refused to confirm on deny that their secretive client is indeed Ciaramella. \u201cWe neither confirm nor deny the identity of the Intelligence Community Whistleblower,\u201d the lawyers told the Washington Examiner in response to an inquiry about Ciaramella. Zaid and Bakaj added, \u201cOur client is legally entitled to anonymity. Disclosure of the name of any person who may be suspected to be the whistleblower places that individual and their family in great physical danger. Any physical harm the individual and/or their family suffers as a result of disclosure means that the individuals and publications reporting such names will be personally liable for that harm. Such behavior is at the pinnacle of irresponsibility and is intentionally reckless.\u201d Soros funding and \u2018whistleblower\u2019 complaint Besides Burisma funding, the Atlantic Council is also financed by Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundations, Google, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, Inc., and the U.S. State Department. Google, Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundations, the Rockefeller Fund, and an agency of the State Department each also finance a self-described investigative journalism organization repeatedly referenced as a source of information in the so-called whistleblower\u2019s complaint alleging Trump was \u201cusing the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country\u201d in the 2020 presidential race. The charges in the July 22 report referenced in the so-called whistleblower\u2019s document and released by the Google and Soros-funded organization, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), seem to be the public precursors for a lot of the so-called whistleblower\u2019s own claims, as Breitbart News documented. One key section of the so-called whistleblower\u2019s document claims that \u201cmultiple U.S. officials told me that Mr. Giuliani had reportedly privately reached out to a variety of other Zelensky advisers, including Chief of Staff Andriy Bohdan and Acting Chairman of the Security Service of Ukraine Ivan Bakanov.\u201d This was allegedly to follow up on Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky in order to discuss the \u201ccases\u201d mentioned in that call, according to the so-called whistleblower\u2019s narrative. The complainer was clearly referencing Trump\u2019s request for Ukraine to investigate the Biden corruption allegations. Even though the statement was written in first person \u2013 \u201cmultiple U.S. officials told me\u201d \u2013 it contains a footnote referencing a report by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP). That footnote reads: In a report published by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) on 22 July, two associates of Mr. Giuliani reportedly traveled to Kyiv in May 2019 and met with Mr. Bakanov and another close Zelensky adviser, Mr. Serhiy Shefir. The so-called whistleblower\u2019s account goes on to rely upon that same OCCRP report on three more occasions. It does so to: The OCCRP report repeatedly referenced is actually a \u201cjoint investigation by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) and BuzzFeed News, based on interviews and court and business records in the United States and Ukraine.\u201d BuzzFeed infamously also first published the full anti-Trump dossier alleging unsubstantiated collusion between Trump\u2019s presidential campaign and Russia. The dossier was paid for by Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign and the Democratic National Committee, and was produced by the Fusion GPS opposition dirt outfit. The OCCRP and BuzzFeed \u201cjoint investigation\u201d resulted in both OCCRP and BuzzFeed publishing similar lengthy pieces on July 22 claiming that Giuliani was attempting to use connections to have Ukraine investigate Trump\u2019s political rivals. The so-called whistleblower\u2019s document, however, only mentions the largely unknown OCCRP and does not reference BuzzFeed, which has faced scrutiny over its reporting on the Russia collusion claims.

      "author": "John Nolte",
      "content": "Between the Democrats, their Sergeant Schultz witnesses (I see nutzing! I see nutzing first or even secondhand! I see nutzinggggg!), and their media allies, is to create the impression Trump was doing something illegal and unethical when he ignored these \u201cregular diplomatic channels.\u201d This is what we call gaslighting, this is where America\u2019s coup plotters in the Deep State and media attempt to fool us into believing the following: it is illegal for the president to put in place his own foreign policy. The truth is this, at least to those of us who still revere the Constitution: there is only ONE \u201cregular diplomatic channel,\u201d and that is whatever the hell the president says it is. And when a bunch of unelected bureaucrats, like these crybaby witnesses (who witnessed nothing), accuse the president of ignoring \u201cregular diplomatic channels\u201d it is they who are making a mockery of the Constitution, it is they who are engaging in treasonous behavior, it is them putting themselves and their illegal \u201cregular diplomatic channels\u201d above the law. It comes down to this\u2026 Either voters get to choose who governs us, or unelected Deep State bureaucrats, accountable to no one, decide how we are governed. So far, these insufferably smug, power-hungry impeachment witnesses have sided with the latter \u2014 with the idea that they, The Unaccountable, get to decide. At least for now, though, the Constitution still sides with voters, and this is what the establishment media want you to forget, this is what they want to gaslight you with. You see, according to the Constitution, we the people are given regular opportunities to choose our own leaders. We the governed get to choose who will govern us. Every two years, we choose the full House of Representatives. Every two years, we choose 1/3rd of our senators. And every four years, we hold our only national referendum to choose our president. Every four years, we the people choose one person to run the executive branch, one person to be commander in chief of the armed forces, and \u2014 this is important \u2014 one person to be in charge of foreign policy. There is no senator, no congressman, no general, no judge, no bureaucrat, no diplomat, no blow-dried cable news anchor who has any say in foreign policy. The president and the president alone gets to decide on foreign policy. Which means the following\u2026 Even if the president is the Orange Bad Man and he chooses to send Rudy Giuliani, Jerry Lewis, Fred Flintstone, and the corpse of Marilyn Monroe to handle his foreign policy, that is by law the only REGULAR DIPLOMATIC CHANNEL. That means that if Barack Obama wants to send pallets of cash to bribe Iran into pretending they are not making nukes, those pallets of cash are a regular diplomatic channel. Alternately, when bureaucrats and crybaby diplomats put in place systems that work against the president, they are the un-American, fascist, illegal, unethical, un-constitutional traitors who are slapping the American people in the face \u2014 going around us, governing us without our consent. Hey, it makes sense that three competing branches of government, that three cooks are in the kitchen of domestic policy. The executive (president) represents the national will. The House (legislative) represents the population. The Senate (also legislative) represents the states. The judicial branch represents the law. The Constitution deliberately puts checks and balances into place to make it difficult to get things done domestically. This difficulty is the enemy of the revolutions that create instability. But you can\u2019t have that overseas, you can\u2019t have a bunch of cooks cooking up foreign policy. For reasons that need not be explained, such a thing would be a recipe for disaster, for chaos and confusion. Therefore it makes perfect sense to put one person in charge of foreign policy, the only person chosen by national referendum. This also means accountability for the president\u2019s foreign policy falls to we the people, and in the modern presidency this has mattered. President Lyndon Johnson\u2019s mishandling of the Vietnam War made him so unpopular he chose not to seek re-election in 1968. In 1980, Jimmy Carter\u2019s mishandling of the Iran hostage crisis and the Soviets were a big part of his failure to win a second term. That\u2019s just how it is, and don\u2019t let anyone tell you different. That is the law. That is the Constitution. That is the American system. And if Trump believed the only way to institute his foreign policy was to work around these hideously arrogant bureaucrats and diplomats, that should only serve as a reminder that the Deep State is real, is toxic, is dangerous, is un-American, and must be pulled out by the roots.

      "subtitle": "The population of so-called \u201cDreamer\u201d illegal aliens has risen by at least one million since President Barack Obama announced his Rose Garden DACA amnesty for child migrants who entered the United States before 2007.",
      "author": "Neil Munro",
      "content": "\u201cAs of 2017, we estimate that the United States has more than 1.1 million illegal immigrants who arrived before the age of 16 but are not eligible for the current DACA program because they arrived after the [2007] cutoff time,\u201d said a November 18 study by Jason Richwine, a demographer who works with the Center for Immigration Studies. Many more children were brought over the border in 2018 and 2019 because border defenses were paralyzed by the alliance of Democrats, immigration lawyers, judges, and cheap-labor Republicans. In part, the rush of foreign parents with children came because the migrants saw the Democrats offering the huge prize of citizenship to the prior wave of DACA illegal aliens. According to Richwine: [In 2018 and 2019], border apprehensions have increased dramatically, so did the predicted number of childhood arrivals whom we would expect to observe in the ACS [the Census Bureau\u2019s American Community Survey]: 227,000 in 2018 and a remarkable 437,000 in 2019, according to the model \u2026 it is plausible that the pool of potential DACA recipients has grown enormously in the last two years, as the number of family units apprehended at the border certainly has.  Any amnesty would lower Americans\u2019 wages by raising the labor supply, bump up Americans\u2019 rents by growing the population, further pack Americans\u2019 blue-collar schools with migrant children, and continue to shift the focus of American politics away from Americans\u2019 priorities. Richwine\u2019s data suggests a DACA amnesty could include nearly four million youths and children \u2014 which is roughly equal to the number of young Americans who will turn 18 this year. In June, Democrats passed their \u201cDream and Promise Act\u201d amnesty, which was low-balled by supporters as an amnesty for 2.5 million illegal aliens. That number included non-DACA migrants who are facing a legal end to their \u201cTemporary Protective Status\u201d (TPS) and \u201cDeferred Enforced Departure\u201d (DED) programs. For example, the Washington Post downplayed the illegality of the migrants and their numbers, saying in a headline that \u201cHouse Democrats propose offering 2 million immigrants the chance to apply for U.S. citizenship.\u201d One pro-migration group estimated the beneficiaries would total 2.7 million illegal aliens and TPS migrants: [The Migration Policy Institute] estimates that 2.3 million DREAMers would be eligible for conditional legal status under the bill, and 429,000 TPS and DED holders could apply immediately for legal permanent residence (also known as getting a green card). All told, MPI estimates that HR 6 would put slightly less than 2.7 million of the nation\u2019s estimated 11.3 million unauthorized immigrants on a path to a green card. That MPI estimate excludes the one million-plus population identified by Richwine \u2014 even though the Democrats\u2019 bill explicitly bars the deportation of the younger-than-DACA illegal aliens. According to the MPI: The measure would also block the deportation of anyone under age 18 who entered the country at least four years before the bill\u2019s enactment, under the assumption that they would become eligible for conditional status as they further their education. In doing so, the measure would also offer work authorization to these unauthorized immigrant minors, as it would to anyone applying for legal status under HR 6, while the application is pending. Moreover, the Democrats\u2019 bill would prevent the deportation of anyone \u2014 including recent arrivals and suspected criminals \u2014 until officials could show they are ineligible for the broadened amnesty. The MPI said: the bill would make people ineligible for deportation if they could show that, at first glance, they were eligible for legal status under HR 6 or through other existing channels, such as asylum or cancellation of removal. (Cancellation of removal is available to unauthorized immigrants who have lived in the United States for at least 10 years; show good moral character; and who have a U.S.-citizen or lawful permanent resident parent, spouse, or child who would suffer extreme consequences if the applicant were removed.) Moreover, any of the DACA amnesties would put the DACA illegal aliens on a track to citizenship \u2014 and so allow them to campaign for an amnesty of the illegal immigrant parents who brought them as children into the United States. DACA legalization would also open up new channels of chain migration, although the annual inflow would not increase unless Democrats also voted to expand the inflow of roughly one million foreigners each year.  Immigration Numbers: Each year, roughly four million young\u00a0Americans join the workforce after graduating from high school\u00a0or a university. This total includes about 800,000 Americans who graduate with skilled degrees in business or health care, engineering or science, software, or statistics. But the federal government then imports about 1.1 million legal immigrants. It also adds replacement workers to a resident population of more than 1.5 million white-collar visa workers \u2014 including approximately one million H-1B workers and about 500,000 blue-collar H-2B, H-2A, and J-1 visa workers.\u00a0The government also prints more than\u00a0one million\u00a0work permits\u00a0for new foreigners, and it rarely punishes companies for employing illegal migrants. This policy of inflating the labor supply\u00a0boosts\u00a0economic growth and stock values for\u00a0investors. The stimulus happens because the extra labor ensures that employers do not have to compete for American workers by offering higher wages and better working conditions. The federal policy of\u00a0flooding\u00a0the market with cheap, foreign white-collar\u00a0graduates\u00a0and blue-collar labor\u00a0shifts wealth from young employees toward older investors. It also\u00a0widens\u00a0wealth gaps, reduces high-tech investment, increases\u00a0state and local tax burdens, reduces\u00a0marriage\u00a0rates, and hurts children\u2019s schools and college\u00a0educations. The cheap-labor economic strategy also\u00a0pushes\u00a0Americans away from high-tech careers, and it sidelines millions of marginalized Americans, including many who are now\u00a0struggling\u00a0with drug addictions. The labor policy also moves business investment and wealth from the\u00a0Heartland\u00a0to the coastal cities, explodes\u00a0rents and housing\u00a0costs, undermines suburbia, shrivels\u00a0real estate values in the Midwest, and rewards investors for creating low-tech,\u00a0labor-intensive workplaces. But President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cHire American\u201d policy is boosting wages by capping immigration within a growing economy. The Census Bureau\u00a0said\u00a0September 10 that men who work full-time and year-round got an earnings boost of 3.4 percent in 2018, pushing their median salaries up to $55,291. Women gained 3.3 percent in wages, bringing their median salaries to $45,097 for full-time, year-round work. ",

      "subtitle": "WASHINGTON, DC \u2014 Former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Jeffrey Piatt in 2015 joined three impeachment probe witnesses in calling for an investigation into the corruption-linked Burisma company and its owner while then Vice-President\u2019s Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, was working at the Ukrainian company.",
      "author": "Edwin Mora",
      "content": "Piatt [or Pyatt], who preceded former U.S. Ukraine Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, is the fourth official who worked under former President Barack Obama to raise malfeasance concerns about Burisma. Piatt, however, is the only individual who has not testified in the ongoing impeachment probe to deem a corruption investigation into Burisma necessary. The four complainants against Burisma suggest there is merit to U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s concerns about Hunter Biden\u2019s work on the company\u2019s board of directors. Corruption concerns about Burisma began with allegations against the Ukranian company\u2019s owner, Mykola Zlochevsy. The United States spent hundreds of thousands helping to investigate Zlochevsy. Combating corruption in Ukraine has long been a significant component of American policy towards Ukraine. House Democrats, however, refuse to allow Hunter to testify, denying that he is at the center of the impeachment probe. During the public impeachment probe hearing Tuesday, featuring testimony from U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, testified Rep. Devin Nunes from California, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee hosting the hearing, declared: You wouldn\u2019t be the first ambassador to be interested in Burisma, did you know that in 2015, U.S. Amb. Jeffrey Piatt\u2019s as U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine privately called fro an investigation into Zlochevsky, the president of Burisma. This [Piatt] is the Ukrainian ambassador appointed by Obama in Ukraine.\n\n\u2026 You would not be the first one to be mentioning that investigations should be done into Burisma because it happened under the Obama administration. Did you know that financial records show Burisma routed more $3 million into the account of Hunter Biden. Sondland claimed he was not aware of Piatt\u2019s concerns about Burisma. He also claimed ignorance of the company\u2019s decision to route more than $3 million over five years to accounts linked to Hunter Biden. Hunter served on the Ukrainian company\u2019s board directors while his father was President Obama\u2019s head honcho for Ukraine policy. Impeachment probe witnesses \u2014\u00a0George Kent, Catherine Croft, and Christopher Anderson \u2014 all raised concerns about Burisma\u2019s potential affiliation to corruption, at times when Hunter was working there. Besides former Amb. Piatt, Kent, Croft, and Anderson still all work for the State Department. They did so when they expressed concerns about Burisma. Kent testified during his October 15 closed-door deposition that he raised concerns about Burisma and its owners, but VP Biden\u2019s office ignored him. U.S. Special Envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker\u00a0and Sondland had both called for investigations into Burisma and its owner, to no avail. Echoing Volker, Sondland said during his public testimony Tuesday that an investigation into corruption allegations against Burisma would be appropriate. Trump\u2019s private attorney Rudy Giuliani traveled to Ukraine to investigate Ukraine\u2019s possible efforts to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential elections. Democrats and their mainstream media allies argue there is no wrongdoing evidence against the Bidens. At the behest of VP Biden, however, information into the matter was buried. Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor Viktor Shokin who had investigated Burisma, threatening to withhold loan guarantees if it did not play ball. If that sounds familiar, you have been paying attention, because it sounds like the quid pro quo that Dems are trying to pin on Trump. \u201cShokin\u2019s replacement, Yuri Lutsenko, continued the investigation into Burisma and concluded there was no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe Biden or his son,\u201d the New York Post noted. Corruption, however, is prevalent in Ukraine and could have played a role in clearing the Bidens. Russian Ryaboshapka, the new prosecutor under Zelensky \u2014 who ran on combating corruption, has vowed to \u201creview all previous cases concerning [the Burisma] gas company at the heart of the impeachment inquiry into President Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine,\u201d the Washington Post reported on October 4. A U.S. intelligence community \u201cwhistleblower\u201d complaint filed August 12 accuses Trump of engaging in a quid pro quo during a July 25 call in which he allegedly pressured Zelensky to investigate the Bidens in exchange for aid, The testimony from four State officials shows that Obama knew of corruption concerns about Burisma. U.S. State testimony about corruption suggests there could be merit to Trump suggesting Ukraine investigate corruption allegations linked to the Bidens. Hunter admitted getting the lucrative job at Burisma because of his father\u2019s position. Even officials who have testified against Trump\u2019s interactions in Ukraine have said there was no pressure for the Eastern European country to investigate the Bidens. House Democrats are not allowing the Republicans to request the \u201cwhistleblower,\u201d whose complaint alleging a quid pro quo trigge\u00e5d the impeachment probe, and Hunter Biden to testify.",

In 2011, President Obama had dinner with Zuckerberg and other tech leaders including Apple CEO Steve Jobs, outgoing Google CEO Eric Schmidt, then CEO of Twitter Dick Costolo, and Reed Hastings, the CEO of Netflix. Obama also participated in a Facebook town hall with Zuckerberg in 2011. \u201cThe first time we had dinner together and he wore this jacket and tie,\u201d Obama recalled about Zuckerberg. \u201cI\u2019d say halfway through dinner he\u2019s starting to sweat a little bit.

The Foreign Service Journal reported: Through this experience Holmes came to believe that the division of authority between the Office of Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan and the Bureau of Central and South Asian Affairs \u201chindered our diplomatic effectiveness an deprived policy makers of coordinated strategic advice.\u201d For speaking out on this issue Holmes received the 2014 William R. Rivkin Award for constructive dissent by a mid-level FSO [Foreign Service Officer]. The article includes a photo of Holmes meeting with President Barack Obama in the White House and another photo of Holmes holding his award. (The Foreign Service Journal) (The Foreign Service Journal) In September 2014 the AFSA website published a story about staffers who had won dissent awards, including Holmes: This year was the first since 2006 that AFSA has presented all four dissent awards (they are conferred only when a fitting recipient is identified). This year, too, the number of deserving nominations received for exemplary performance awards surpassed that of previous years. \u201cIn the non-business- as-usual approach of the office of the SRAP,\u201d his award nomination states, \u201cDavid Holmes was both a dedicated team player in shaping our policies, as well as a courageous advocate for doing so in a more coordinated and strategic way.\u201d (AFSA) Holmes was featured in a photo in another meeting in the White House with Obama in a bizarre story in the New York Post about White House lawyer Avril Haines, who Obama had named as the deputy director of the CIA.

      "author": "Breitbart News",
      "content": "Obama spoke to about 100 donors during a question-and-answer session with Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez in Los Altos Hills, California. The event came a day after the fifth Democratic presidential primary in Atlanta and as the 17-person field continues to expand, with the expected entry of former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg in the coming days. Until recently, Obama largely refrained from opining publicly on the Democratic contest, and his move from the sidelines comes at a moment of deep uncertainty for the party. Many are jittery about the uneven candidacy of his former Vice President Joe Biden, questioning whether Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren can defeat President Donald Trump next year, and skeptical of whether Pete Buttigieg, the South Bend, Indiana, mayor who is surging in Iowa, can appeal to black voters that are a crucial Democratic voting bloc. \u201cWe will not win just by increasing the turnout of the people who already agree with us completely on everything,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWhich is why I am always suspicious of purity tests during elections. Because, you know what, the country is complicated.\u201d Obama urged Democrats to \u201cchill out,\u201d saying, \u201cThe truth of the matter is that every candidate on that stage believes we should provide\u201d better health care and education and address climate change. He also noted the historic diversity of the Democratic field, which now includes five women, three black candidates, a Latino man and a gay man. He compared that to his own election as the nation\u2019s first black president. \u201cWe have a number of women candidates and we have one gay candidate. And those candidates are going to have barriers if they win the nomination, or they win the general election \u2014 just like I did,\u201d Obama told donors. \u201cYou can overcome that resistance if the way you are framing these issues and messages indicate, \u2019Look, I\u2019m part of an American tradition \u2026 of opening up opportunity.\u201d In recent weeks Obama has sought to play both referee and uplifting elder statesman. He\u2019s cautioned \u201cwoke\u201d activists against embracing \u201ccancel culture\u201d and urged the party to not adopt positions that could cost them in the general election. \u201cThat\u2019s not bringing about change,\u201d he said during a recent Obama Foundation event. \u201cIf all you are doing is casting stones, you\u2019re probably not going to get that far.\u201d At the same time, he has offered reassurances that a spirited primary will make the eventual nominee a stronger candidate. It comes amid a fierce intraparty debate that has divided centrists and an ascendant progressive wing, which has advocated for policies like free college tuition and \u201cMedicare for All\u201d that would dramatically reshape the role of government in peoples\u2019 lives. Elections are ultimately won by offering a message that appeals to voters across the demographic spectrum, Obama said. \u201cWe should not be somehow thinking either we\u2019re going for our base voter of young hipsters and African Americans and single women versus Joe lunch-pail, hard-hat guy,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause you know what? \u2026 I\u2019ve had conversations with all those groups, and they share common dreams and common hopes and a vision for what a fair, just America would look like.\u201d The fundraiser Thursday was held at the home of Karla Jurvetson, a prominent Democratic donor and Silicon Valley philanthropist. The event raised more than $3 million for the Democratic National Committee, according to a senior party official.",

Initially, a member of the group told Biden it was difficult as an immigrant to trust him because of\u00a0his defense of the three million deportations that occurred under President Barack Obama\u2019s tenure in office. The activist, who addressed Biden in Spanish through a translator, asked the former vice president if he would commit to ending such deportations through executive action on his first day in office. \u201cNo, I will not stop all deportations,\u201d Biden responded. \u201cI will prioritize deportations, only people who have committed a felony or a serious crime.\u201d The answer seemed not to please the Carlos Rojas, the activist who was translating for the initial questioner. Rojas, who claimed to have been a volunteer for Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign, began lecturing Biden about the deportations that occurred during his service in the vice presidency. Biden, for his part, seemed unwilling to indulge the activist. \u201cYou should vote for Trump,\u201d the former vice president cut off Rojas mid-sentence as the activist was laying out the Obama administration\u2019s record on immigration.\u201dYou should vote for Trump,\u201d Biden repeated mockingly. \u201cNo, I am not going to do that,\u201d Rojas responded, before demanding Biden pledge to end all deportations if elected in president. \u201cWe want to hear you say that.\u201d The former vice president tried to double down on his promise to not stop deportations for those that commit felonies, but was met with shouts of \u201cnot one more deportation\u201d by the crowd.  After the confrontation Movimiento Cosecha, issued a statement denouncing the former vice president\u2019s refusal to support a \u201cfull moratorium\u201d on deportations. \u201cBy now, it is clear that the immigrant community cannot trust Biden,\u201d Rojas said in the statement. \u201cWe won\u2019t accept empty promises of immigration reform, while our families are torn apart. We cannot allow history to repeat itself.\u201d This is not the first time that Biden has faced trouble over his immigration position on the campaign trail. In July, one day after his campaign headquarters was stormed by open borders protesters, the former vice president was confronted by an immigration activist in New Hampshire. The activist, who claimed to be undergoing deportation proceedings, demanded that Biden \u201capologize to the three million immigrants that were deported and separated from their families under the Obama years.\u201d The former vice president simply smirked\u00a0at the cameras taping the altercation, before telling the activist he would do no such thing. \u201cI will not apologize for the deportation of people who have committed a felony,\u201d Biden said at the time.",

      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": "Warren answered a question about the ongoing partisan impeachment hearing during Wednesday evening\u2019s Democrat debate and mentioned Ambassador Gordon Sondland \u2013 a key witness of the Democrats who testified that Trump told him, \u201cI want nothing. I want no quid pro quo\u201d \u2013 and contended he landed his position due to his status as a big donor. She said: But I want to add one more part based on today\u2019s testimony, and that is, how did Ambassador Sondland get there? You know, this is not a man who had any qualifications, except one: He wrote a check for a million dollars. And that tells us about what\u2019s happening in Washington, the corruption, how money buys its way into Washington. You know, I raised this months ago about the whole notion that donors think they\u2019re going to get ambassadorships on the other side. And I\u2019ve taken a pledge. Anyone who wants to give me a big donation, don\u2019t ask to be an ambassador, because I\u2019m not going to have that happen. I asked everyone who\u2019s running for president to join me in that and not a single person has so far. I hope what we saw today during the testimony means lots of people will sign on and say we are not going to give away these ambassador posts to the highest bidder. She also released an ad, reiterating the point she made during the debate. Warren states in the ad: At the center of Donald Trump\u2019s crimes and chaos is the millionaire donor he made an ambassador Republicans and Democrats have been rewarding big donors with cushy ambassadorships like this for years. It\u2019s Washington corruption at its worst. When I\u2019m president, that stops. I\u2019m the only candidate running who\u2019s made this promise. I\u2019ll never give ambassadorships to\u00a0unqualified donors just because they wrote me fat checks.  However, Warren did not seem to take issue with the concept during Obama\u2019s tenure, confirming his nominees who held no diplomatic experience. One of those nominees included Hollywood producer\u00a0Colleen Bell, whose experience amounted to raising $2 million for Obama\u2019s campaigns. Despite that, he nominated her to be the ambassador to Hungary. \u201cDuring her confirmation hearing, Bell\u00a0failed\u00a0to name a single strategic interest the United States has in Hungary,\u201d as the Washington Free Beacon reported. Nevertheless, Warren confirmed her. More via Free Beacon: Warren was a senator, for example, when Obama nominated Noah Bryson Mamet to be U.S. ambassador to Argentina\u2014Mamet was a\u00a0political operative\u00a0with no diplomatic experience who\u00a0raised millions of dollars\u00a0for Obama\u2019s presidential campaigns. It was revealed during Mamet\u2019s confirmation hearing that he had\u00a0never been to Argentina. Warren voted to\u00a0confirm\u00a0Mamet, who passed through the Senate with 50 votes and none from Republicans. \u2026 Warren also voted to\u00a0confirm\u00a0Crystal Nix-Hines, who\u00a0wrote scripts\u00a0for ABC\u2019s\u00a0Alias\u00a0and\u00a0raised over $1 million\u00a0for Obama, to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization. An analysis by the\u00a0Center for Public Integrity\u00a0found that Obama rewarded 31 of his campaign bundlers with ambassador posts during his second term. Another 39 ambassador nominees \u201ceither gave him campaign money or are known political allies.\u201d Warren has yet to publicly address the reasoning behind her previous votes that directly contradict the position she outlines in her presidential platform.",

      "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
      "content": "That advice came to mind as I tried to make sense of what South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg \u2014 a fellow Harvard graduate \u2014 told an interviewer recently about whether he would be willing to send troops to Mexico. It seemed to me that he answered the question by saying everything \u2014 and also nothing. Classic Harvard bullshit: Q: Mr. Mayor, after a number of Americans\u00a0were murdered in Northern Mexico, President Trump\u00a0suggested sending U.S. troops to help Mexico deal with the cartels. With your military experience,\u00a0is there a way to deal with the\u00a0cartels that doesn\u2019t violate Mexico\u2019s sovereignty? Buttigieg: Well, one of the biggest things I learned during my time deployed abroad is the importance of our alliances, our friendships. And this president, needless to say, has destroyed\u00a0just about every relationship he\u00a0can find. That makes America less safe. Whether it is turning our back\u00a0on Kurdish allies, who put their lives on the line to help us fight ISIS, or right here in our own\u00a0hemisphere, alienating those very countries that we\u00a0need to have a better\u00a0partnership with. Remember, it is in the interest of both the United States and Mexico for Mexico to prosper with greater economic success and security then they have right now. So, if it is in the context of a\u00a0security partnership, then I would\u00a0welcome ways to make sure that America is doing what we can to ensure that our neighbor to the south is secure. But doing it in a way that calls into question Mexican sovereignty completely misses how we got here. By the way, a lot of this is a\u00a0question of the demand side on the United States. Part of what we do is make drug trafficking\u00a0less profitable by walking away\u00a0from the failed war on drugs here in the United States. That is a policy that we know through experience hasn\u2019t worked. We have got to do our part here at home, and partner with countries abroad. Q: But Mayor, specifically \u2014 do you see a time when troops\u00a0can go into Mexico, if Mexico welcomed it, for instance? Buttigieg: There is a scenario where we could have security cooperation \u2014 as we do with countries around the world. Now, I would only order American troops into conflict if there were no other choice, if American lives were on the line, and if this were necessary for us to uphold our treaty obligations. But we could absolutely be in some partnership\u00a0role if, and only if, it is welcomed by\u00a0our partner south of the border. To summarize: he would only send troops in if American lives were at stake. But as a matter of fact, American lives\u00a0are at stake, which is exactly what the interviewer said in her question. He sounded smart, but actually said nothing. It was so confusing that when Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) attacked him at the Democrat debate on Wednesday night in Atlanta, Georgia, for what he said about Mexico, Buttigieg fired back that he was talking about \u201ccooperation,\u201d not invasion. They were both right: his answer covered every option. When he was asked if he would keep farm subsidies in place, Buttigieg said that the trade war with China \u201cshouldn\u2019t have been started in the first place.\u201d Then he started a riff about climate change, and something he called a \u201ccarbon negative farm.\u201d It\u2019s not clear how to fight climate change without confronting China, the world\u2019s dirtiest economy. Regardless, Moderator Rachel Maddow noticed that Buttigieg hadn\u2019t answered the question, and asked it again: \u201cWould you continue those subsidies or not?\u201d His answer: \u201cYes, but we won\u2019t need them because we\u2019re going to fix the trade war.\u201d So \u2014 all of those words, and in the end he agreed with Trump\u2019s current policy, anyway. When he was asked about his struggle to reach African-Americans, he agreed \u2014 and then went on to say \u2026 something (via\u00a0NBC): My response is, I completely agree. And I welcome the challenge of connecting with black voters in America who don\u2019t yet know me. And before I share what\u2019s in my plans, let me talk about what\u2019s in my heart and why this is so important. As mayor of a city that is racially diverse and largely low income, for eight years, I have lived and breathed the successes and struggles of a community where far too many people live with the consequences of racial inequity that has built-up over centuries but been compounded by policies and decisions from within living memory. I care about this because my faith teaches me that salvation has to do with how I make myself useful to those who have been excluded, marginalized, and cast aside and oppressed in society. And I care about this because, while I do not have the experience of ever having been discriminated against because of the color of my skin, I do have the experience of sometimes feeling like a stranger in my own country, turning on the news and seeing my own rights come up for debate, and seeing my rights expanded by a coalition of people like me and people not at all like me, working side by side, shoulder to shoulder, making it possible for me to be standing here. Wearing this wedding ring in a way that couldn\u2019t have happened two elections ago lets me know just how deep my obligation is to help those whose rights are on the line every day, even if they are nothing like me in their experience. In other words: I am struggling to connect to black voters, but also I am gay, which is not black but sort of like it. It was a non-response. He showcased his erudition but said nothing about how he would address the problem. (His solution seems to involve\u00a0sucking up to Al Sharpton, despite his history of racism, antisemitism, and homophobia.) Outside the debate, I interviewed some of Buttigieg\u2019s supporters, who formed the single largest contingent of any campaign in Atlanta. I asked them each the same simple question: what has Mayor Pete actually\u00a0achieved? None of them could answer. That is because there is no answer. He has a great r\u00e9sum\u00e9 \u2014 and no achievements. James Freeman of the Wall Street Journal wondered aloud why Buttigieg\u2019s rivals weren\u2019t making more of the fact that his record as mayor in South Bend isn\u2019t much of a record at all: Mr. Buttigieg will depart the mayor\u2019s office in January at the conclusion of his second four-year term. He\u2019s set to leave South Bend a dangerous place with an extremely high murder rate for a city its size. \u2026 Good intensions are nice. But Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D., Minn.) isn\u2019t the only one wondering how far Mr. Buttigieg can go without delivering much in the way of positive results. Regardless, Buttigieg now leads in the polls in Iowa and New Hampshire, even though he trails badly nationwide. He is modeling his strategy after that of Obama, who used an early win in Iowa to shock the field and win the nomination. But the country is still wondering whether it was worth electing a politician who had never really run anything before, and whose main qualification for office was his oratorical skill.\u00a0Trump is a bullshitter \u2014 the very best bullshitter ever! \u2014 but at least he had a reputation for success.

      "content": "Politico\u2019s Ryan Lizza writes: \u201cSometimes [Obama] offers candid advice about his visitors\u2019 strengths and weaknesses. With several lesser-known candidates, according to people who have talked to him or been briefed on his meetings, he was blunt about the challenges of breaking out of a large field. His advice is not always heeded. He told Patrick earlier this year that it was likely \u201ctoo late\u201d for him to secure \u201cmoney and talent\u201d if he jumped in the race. Occasionally, he can be cutting. With one candidate, he pointed out that during his own 2008 campaign, he had an intimate bond with the electorate, especially in Iowa, that he no longer has. Then he added, \u201cAnd you know who really doesn\u2019t have it? Joe Biden.\u201d Obama\u2019s remarks about Biden\u2019s issues in Hawkeye State are reflected in his falling poll numbers. \u201cAccording to the latest\u00a0CBS News Battleground Tracker poll, Biden is down eight points in Iowa from June to November to leave him tied with Senator Bernie Sanders at 22% as the top choice among registered Iowa Democrats. They were just ahead of South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg (21%) and Senator Elizabeth Warren (18%). Other recent polls have shown Biden polling as low as fourth within that top tier, CBS News said. Obama\u2019s brutal assessment of Biden\u2019s performance on the trail, which has been a constant source of concern for Democratic Party officials and primary voters, is sure to add to the narrative that the former president has little\u00a0\u2014 if any \u2014 faith in his former number two\u2019s ability to secure the nomination. Obama infamously did not endorse Biden\u2019s latest White House bid.\u00a0In a\u00a060 Minutes\u00a0interview,\u00a0the former vice president claimed Obama\u2019s silence was at his own request. \u201cI asked him not to,\u201d Biden said.\u00a0\u201cI think it\u2019s better \u2014 I think he thinks it\u2019s better for me.\u201d While Lizza acknowledges this public statement, he writes that Biden \u201cwanted a nudge\u201d and was \u201cinfuriated\u201d by the former president\u2019s reclusive approach to this political cycle. News of Obama\u2019s criticisms about Biden comes as the former president has become more vocal about the 2020 primary content. Obama warned Democrats on Thursday against adopting \u201cpurity tests\u201d in the presidential primary and said any adversity the candidates face in the contest will make whoever emerges an even stronger nominee. Obama spoke to about 100 donors during a question-and-answer session with Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez in Los Altos Hills, California. Until recently, Obama largely refrained from opining publicly on the Democratic contest, and his move from the sidelines comes at a moment of deep uncertainty for the party. Many are jittery about the uneven candidacy of Biden, questioning whether Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) can defeat President Trump next year, and skeptical of whether Pete Buttigieg, the South Bend, Indiana, mayor who is surging in Iowa, can appeal to black voters that are a crucial Democratic voting bloc. \u201cWe will not win just by increasing the turnout of the people who already agree with us completely on everything,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWhich is why I am always suspicious of purity tests during elections. Because, you know what, the country is complicated.\u201d Obama urged Democrats to \u201cchill out,\u201d saying, \u201cThe truth of the matter is that every candidate on that stage believes we should provide\u201d better health care and education and address climate change.

Obama has remained notably silent throughout the Democrat primary\u00a0 \u2013 a development that should come to no surprise to those closely following the race. The former president signaled he would not endorse a primary candidate or speak out in an overly critical manner of any of the presidential hopefuls. According to Politico, Obama views his role as \u201cproviding guardrails to keep the process from getting too ugly and to unite the party when the nominee is clear.\u201d Obama has, largely, stuck to that strategy, refusing to endorse his former running mate Joe Biden (D) and refraining from encouraging the presidential aspirations of his \u201cclose friend\u201d Holder, who teamed up with\u00a0Obama\u2019s Organizing For Action to create the\u00a0All On The Line campaign, a redistricting project \u201caimed at thwarting the use of so-called gerrymandering across the country.\u201d While reports, as recently as early November, indicated\u00a0Holder was still mulling a last-minute presidential bid, the doors are slowly closing. Politico\u00a0reported Holder was reportedly \u201cfrustrated\u201d Obama did not encourage his plans for a presidential bid, with a source close to Holder telling the outlet that \u201che\u2019s [Holder\u2019s] still pretty sensitive about it.\u201d The source said Biden\u2019s bid threw a political wrench in Holder\u2019s plans, because the two \u201chave the same set of people,\u201d making a run far too complicated. But now, Biden\u2019s lackluster performances \u2013 in both the debates and on the campaign trail \u2013 are proving the initial concerns of many within the Democrat establishment, which is \u201creally frustrating to Eric.\u201d \u201cHe was really frustrated about having arrived at the decision not to run. Holder couldn\u2019t get in because Biden and Holder have the same set of people. Once Biden was getting in then Eric couldn\u2019t get in.

The former president reportedly said, prior to Biden\u2019s entry into the race, that the former vice president would have to \u201cearn\u201d the nomination without his endorsement. It remains to be seen if Michael Bloomberg\u2019s late entry will affect Holder\u2019s decision to stay out of the race.",

According to Politico, Obama has also been \u201cskeptical about the prospects of Mayor Pete Buttigieg,\u201d unsure of Sen. Kamala Harris\u2019s (D-CA) appeal among black voters, and privately said that a Warren nomination would be a \u201crepudiation\u201d of him when she considered running in 2015.

      "content": "The longish piece is written by CNN\u2019s Ryan Lizza, who was fired from the New Yorker in 2017 over credible allegations of sexual misconduct, and it\u2019s the usual-usual from this crowd: unnamed sources, friends of friends\u2026 So you have to assume most of it is either fake news or the use of selective sources that allow the writer to spread the selective message of his choice. One thing that did ring true to me, though, is Team Biden\u2019s obvious anger and frustration over Obama\u2019s silence, over his refusal to defend Biden from the growing Ukraine scandal. Here\u2019s the relevant portion: One person who is very close to both Obama and Biden said the only time the Biden campaign has been disappointed in Obama is over Trump\u2019s Ukraine scandal. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody in the Biden world challenges Obama\u2019s affection for Biden, or challenges his strategy of not weighing in for anybody,\u201d this person said. \u201dI do think there\u2019s frustration when Joe Biden and Hunter Biden get attacked by Republicans on the Ukrainian thing and they say, \u2019Obama and his administration looked the other way back when this was happening,\u2019 and Obama doesn\u2019t say anything. The Biden people ask, \u2018Why won\u2019t Obama say something?\u2019\u201d \u201cWhy won\u2019t Obama say something?\u201d Well, let me see if I can answer that question for you, but first a recap\u2026 While serving as president, Obama put his vice president, Joe Biden, in charge of diplomatic relations with Ukraine. While Joe was in this influential position, the corrupt oligarch of a corrupt energy company called Burisma paid Joe\u2019s son Hunter $50,000 a month \u2014 a month! \u2014 to sit on the company\u2019s board. This, despite the fact Hunter does not know anything about energy and does not even speak the local language. Worse still, when a local prosecutor started to looking into Burisma, Joe has openly bragged about how he used the threat of withholding U.S. aid to force Ukraine to fire the prosecutor, which they did. And now, thanks to Adam Schiff\u2019s failed (and then some) impeachment hearings, we know that, at the time, the Obama administration was greatly concerned about this obvious conflict of interest, so\u2026 Why would Obama defend Joe, when what Joe and Hunter did was indefensible? Why would Obama pour gasoline all over this fire, when Obama is likely furious at his former wingman for placing this black mark on his presidential legacy? Obama is many things, but he is no dummy, and he knows that if Biden wins the nomination that Trump is going to not only pulverize Biden with Ukraine, he is going to spread that Ukraine stink all over the Obama administration that allowed Hunter\u2019s looting spree to occur. My guess is that Obama would not only like to see Joe\u2019s presidential campaign go away, he would like to see this entire impeachment fiasco disappear. Here\u2019s a glimpse into Obama\u2019s future\u2026 If Pelosi decides to go ahead and impeach Trump (and I think she has no choice at this point if she wants to keep the Democrat base happy), then this goes to the Senate for a trial, a Senate run by Republicans who will never vote to remove Trump over a hoax. But\u2026 Senate Republicans have made it clear that they intend to use the trial to pour a spotlight on Joe and Hunter Biden\u2019s indefensible corruption \u2014 which will, of course, damage Obama\u2019s legacy. So, yeah, Obama\u2019s not speaking up because he\u2019s almost certainly furious with Biden over all of this, and has every right to be. Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and\u00a0Bernie Sanders (I-VT): Publicly, he has been clear that he won\u2019t intervene in the primary for or against a candidate, unless he believed there was some egregious attack. \u201cI can\u2019t even imagine with this field how bad it would have to be for him to say something,\u201d said a close adviser. Instead, he sees his role as providing guardrails to keep the process from getting too ugly and to unite the party when the nominee is clear. There is one potential exception: Back when Sanders seemed like more of a threat than he does now, Obama said privately that if Bernie were running away with the nomination, Obama would speak up to stop him. (Asked about that, a spokesperson for Obama pointed out that Obama recently said he would support and campaign for whoever the Democratic nominee is.) If Bernie were running away with it, I think maybe we would all have to say something. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s likely. It\u2019s not happening.\u201d (Another close Obama friend said, \u201cBernie\u2019s not a Democrat.\u201d) As for Warren, the candidate who has tried to bridge the worlds of Sanders and Obama, Obama\u2019s relationship with Warren is famously complicated. Back in early 2015, when Warren was considering running for president and started to excite progressives, Obama said privately that if Democrats rallied around her as their nominee it would be a repudiation of him\u2014a clear sign that his economic decisions after the Great Recession had been seen as inadequate. There are very few former senior Obama officials in Warren\u2019s campaign. As for the other candidates, little support can be found from the former president. \u201cObama was deeply skeptical about the prospects of Mayor Pete Buttigieg,\u201d one of Obama\u2019s \u201cclosest advisers\u201d said in the article. \u201cThey discussed doubts about Kamala Harris\u2019 appeal to African Americans,\u201d the article said. As for Steve Bullock, Obama spoke for himself: \u201cNobody knows who you are,\u201d he said. Obama adviser David Axelrod said, \u201cI mean is Michael Bloomberg really the default candidate for non-college educated white voters?\u201d \u201cMaybe Amy [Klobuchar], but I honestly don\u2019t think she\u2019s getting out of Iowa,\u201d Axelrod said. The article tries to paint Obama as a moderate compared to this field of candidates, including Warren and Sanders and their Medicare for All schemes. He is more favorable of former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s and Buttigieg\u2019s healthcare plans. But that\u2019s not to say Obama is ready to buy any bumper stickers. \u201cAnother adviser added, \u2018I don\u2019t think he was trying to benefit Biden here. Buttigieg benefits from this too. Knowing Obama as well as I do, he doesn\u2019t want to help anyone or hurt anyone, he just wants to win the 2020 election,\u2019\u201d the article said. Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) is only mentioned once in the article as one of the candidates who has sought advice from Obama. Follow Penny Starr on Twitter.",

The lawsuit originated from a routine audit of Oracle\u2019s hiring and pay in 2014. The Obama-era complaint alleged that the company had discriminated against \u201cqualified\u201d blacks, Asians, and women in \u201cproduct development roles\u201d by paying them less than their white counterparts. The Obama-era DOL also claimed Oracle discriminated against blacks, Hispanics, and whites in favor of Asian applicants in two other positions, meaning that Oracle had allegedly discriminated against and in favor of Asians. One\u00a0Wall Street Journal op-ed wondered why President Donald Trump\u2019s Labor Secretary, Alexander Acosta, \u201cwould continue his predecessor\u2019s depredations that seek to dictate how businesses manage their workforces and rewrite civil-rights and labor law according to the left\u2019s identity politics.\u201d Now Eugune Scalia is running the DOL he could have the opportunity to the Obama-era lawsuit against Oracle. \u201cIt is apparent that neither Solicitor of Labor Kate O\u2019Scannlain nor OFCCP Director Craig Leen is prepared to move back to a system where merits trump optics,\u201d Glueck said. \u201cOracle brings this suit because the leadership at the Department of Labor has failed to restore balance to an unrestrained bureaucracy.\u201d \u201cWe believe strongly in maintaining a level playing field in the workplace for all our employees and remain proud of our firm commitment to equality in our workforce. This lawsuit seeks to ensure that employers such as Oracle are likewise entitled to a level playing field when the government asserts claims of discrimination,\u201d he added. \u201cThis has not been the case with the OFCCP, resulting in enforcement actions that are meritless and defamatory to Oracle, its executives, and other government contractors,\u201d Glueck concluded in his statement.

      "content": "\u201cJust this week, I stuck up for three great warriors against the Deep State,\u201d Trump told cheering supporters during the rally in Sunrise, Florida, on Tuesday night. Trump said he pardoned\u00a0two soldiers this month despite many of his advisers arguing against it. \u201cPeople have to be able to fight; these are great warriors,\u201d Trump said. He asserted that soldiers should not have to look over their shoulders while fighting or worry about their own country prosecuting them if they make a mistake. \u201cI will always stick up for our great fighters. People can sit there in air-conditioned offices and complain, but you know what? Doesn\u2019t matter to me whatsoever,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey\u2019re out in that field and they\u2019re doing a job for us like nobody else anywhere in the world can do.\u201d Trump pointed to the case of Army First Lt. Clint Lorance, who had already served six years in prison for a 19-year sentence he received after ordering his platoon to fire on men on a motorcycle in Afghanistan he thought were terrorists. \u201cHe came out. He hugged his parents. It was a beautiful thing. We gave him a pardon because we take care of our warriors,\u201d Trump said, referring to a video of his family welcoming him after his release:  Trump\u2019s decision drew criticism from the media as well as Democrat presidential candidates, but the president indicated that he wanted his legacy to be different from that of former President Barack Obama. A reporter asked President Trump on Monday if with his decision he was sending the wrong message to American soldiers. Trump replied that he was sticking up for the military against what he saw as an \u201cunfair\u201d system. He referred to the case of Bowe Bergdahl, who was freed under President Barack Obama\u2019s administration in 2014 and hailed as a hero, despite his decision to desert his post. \u201cWhen you have a system that allows Sgt. Bergdahl to go, and you probably had five to six people killed \u2026 and he gets a slap on the wrist, if that, and then you have a system where these warriors get put in jail for 25 years \u2014 I\u2019m going to stick up for our warrior,\u201d Trump said. Bergdahl received a dishonorable discharge for his actions, avoiding prison time. Trump also noted that Obama pardoned Chelsea Manning, a soldier who stole classified information and leaked it to WikiLeaks. \u201cChelsea Manning went around and badmouthed President Obama on top of everything else,\u201d Trump said, referring to a column\u00a0Manning wrote criticizing Obama\u2019s legacy. Obama commuted Manning\u2019s 35-year prison sentence shortly before leaving office in 2017: ",

      "subtitle": "A prominent member of the board of directors of Burisma Holdings, the Ukrainian oil and gas conglomerate at the center of the impeachment inquiry, admitted on Friday that Hunter Biden was tapped to join the company because of his father\u2019s political influence.",
      "author": "Haris Alic",
      "content": "Aleksander Kwasniewski, a former president of Poland who joined Burisma\u2019s board around the same time as the younger Biden, told the Associated Press it was normal for corporations to seek out well-connected figures for advisory positions. The former president admitted that both he and Hunter Biden secured their posts with Burisma, which at times paid as much as $83,000 per month, due to the influence afforded by their names. \u201cI understand that if someone asks me to be part of some project it\u2019s not only because I\u2019m so good, it\u2019s also because I am Kwasniewski and I am a former president of Poland,\u201d Kwasniewski said. \u201cAnd this is all inter-connected. No-names are a nobody. Being Biden is not bad. It\u2019s a good name.\u201d The former president proceeded to claim that Hunter Biden was an integral part of the board, despite having no background in the energy sector and never once visiting Ukraine during his five-year tenure with Burisma. \u201cHe collected information,\u201d Kwasniewski said, claiming Hunter Biden helped the company with corporate governance.\u00a0\u201cHe was useful for us because he knew something that we didn\u2019t know.\u201d Kwasniewski\u2019s comments come as Burisma and it ties to Hunter Biden have taken center stage in the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump.\u00a0The company became central to the proceedings when Trump suggested the Ukrainian government investigate how Hunter Biden was able to secure a seat on its board of directors in the first place. Democrats claim the president\u2019s suggestion amounted to asking a foreign power for dirt on a political opponent, which they argue is an\u00a0impeachable offense. Trump\u00a0and his allies, on the other hand, have countered that Hunter Biden\u2019s appointment, coming around the same time former Vice President Joe Biden was tapped to lead Obama-era policy towards Ukraine, and his relative inexperience in the energy industry warrant investigation. As Peter Schweizer, senior contributor at Breitbart News, detailed in his\u00a0book\u00a0Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends, Hunter Biden\u2019s background in investment banking, lobbying, and hedge fund management paled in comparison to that of current and past members of Burisma\u2019s board. Adding to concerns is the fact that at the time Hunter Biden joined Burisma, the company was seen as actively courting leaders in the West to prevent further scrutiny of its business practices. The same month Hunter Biden and Kwasniewski were tapped to join the group\u2019s board, the government of Great Britain\u00a0froze\u00a0accounts belonging to Burisma\u2019s founder, Mykola\u00a0Zlochevsky, under suspicion of money laundering. A Ukrainian official with strong ties to Zlochevsky admitted in October the only reason that Hunter Biden secured the appointment was to \u201cprotect\u201d the company from foreign scrutiny. The claim has credence given that at the time, Joe Biden, as the sitting vice president, was tasked with leading the Obama administration\u2019s policy towards Ukraine in response to Russia\u2019s invasion of Crimea. It is in the context of Burisma and Zlochevsky\u2019s legal troubles that Joe Biden\u2019s political influence has raised the most red flags. The former vice president has particularly drawn questions over his conduct in demanding the Ukrainian government fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, in 2016. Joe Biden, who has publicly\u00a0bragged\u00a0about the firing, reportedly threatened to withhold more than one billion\u00a0dollars in U.S. aid if the Ukrainian government did not remove Shokin. He has claimed the demand came from then-President Barack Obama, who had allegedly lost faith in the prosecutor\u2019s ability to tackle corruption. Unofficially, though, it was known that Shokin was investigating both Burisma and Zlochevsky for public corruption. It is uncertain if the probe extended to Hunter Biden, although Shokin has recently admitted that prior to his ouster, he was\u00a0warned\u00a0to back off the matter. Regardless of what occurred, Shokin\u2019s successor, who is now himself being\u00a0investigated\u00a0for public corruption,\u00a0dropped the investigation into Burisma and Zlochevsky. Since the start of the impeachment inquiry, the Ukrainian government has\u00a0reopened its case into Zlochevsky, this time broadening the investigation to include public corruption and embezzlement.\u00a0Even if the Ukrainian government or U.S. law enforcement is unable to prove Zlochevsky and the Bidens acted inappropriately, comments like those by\u00a0Kwasniewski will continue to create negative public perception around the matter. Hunter Biden himself has not helped the situation, especially when he\u00a0admitted\u00a0during an ABC News interview in October that his father\u2019s political influence was the likely reason for his appointment to Burisma\u2019s board. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. Probably not, in retrospect,\u201d the younger Biden said when asked if he would have been tapped for the lucrative job had his father not been the sitting vice president. He quickly added, though, that\u00a0his family\u2019s political prominence had always played a large role in his dealings. \u201cBut that\u2019s\u2014you know\u2014I don\u2019t think that there\u2019s a lot of things that would have happened in my life if my last name wasn\u2019t Biden.\u201d",
