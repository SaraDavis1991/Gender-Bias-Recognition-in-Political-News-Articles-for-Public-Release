      "content": " While the state of the Democratic Party in 2020 may make some Republicans cringe, it could pay off in the long run for Republicans according to Rep. Mike Rogers (R-AL). During an appearance on Huntsville, AL radio\u2019s WVNN on Thursday, Rogers speculated that if former President Barack Obama were one of the candidates in the 2020 Democratic presidential field, he would not win the party nomination for not being \u201csocialist enough.\u201d \u201cI hear it everywhere I go in my district \u2013 people do see them as the face of the future Democrat Party, and they see these presidential debates, and they see how far left they\u2019re going with their rhetoric,\u201d Rogers said on \u201cThe Jeff Poor Show.\u201d \u201cI just spoke to a civic group in Alex City today at lunch, and I told them \u2013 and I really mean this \u2013 Barack Obama could not win the nomination in this year\u2019s Democrat field. He is not socialist enough to win. That\u2019s how far left they\u2019ve moved. So yeah, when I hear Omar and AOC and Tlaib all talking, I want them to keep it up because it is turning off Americans from coast to coast.\u201d Rogers was still optimistic about Republicans chances of picking up the House in 2020 and warned not to read too much into the recent wave of Republican retirements. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have any effect on it,\u201d he added. \u201cOne of the things that drives me nuts about the national news media is they spin these things to support a narrative they\u2019re promoting. The fact that is we\u2019re not having a larger retirement than we usually have.\u00a0 If you take the last three-and-a-half years and you compare it to the previous three-and-a-half years, it\u2019s the same percentage. Every August recess, we have a lot of people announce they\u2019re retiring in part because they get back home in August and realize \u2018I like being home. I don\u2019t want to do this anymore.\u2019 It\u2019s a tough way of life. There\u2019s a lot of time away from your family. A lot of time spent fundraising. Social media has made it just a nightmare to have to be in these jobs because people just beat the crap out of you constantly, cable news. A lot of folks just don\u2019t want to do this for a long time.\u201d \u201cBut this is nothing out of the ordinary,\u201d he continued. \u201cOne of the things I would urge your audience to look at in the future because I\u2019ve been doing this 17 years now, and I\u2019ve seen this pattern: Every August, especially right at the end of August you get a lot of people announce they\u2019re retiring because they\u2019ve been home for a month and they like being out of Washington and back home. And then after every Christmas break, we have a wave of announcements for the same reason \u2013 people are back home with their family. They realize they like the private life and they want to go back to it. So there is nothing unusual about what\u2019s happening right now.\u201d Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor",

      "content": " Sunday on New York AM 970 radio\u2019s \u201cThe Cats Roundtable,\u201d former House Speaker Newt Gingrich argued that it is not \u201cconceivable\u201d for neither former President Barack Obama nor his Attorney General Loretta Lynch to not know the FBI was spying on the Donald Trump campaign. Gingrich told host John Catsimatidis after the recent release of the Department of Justice\u2019s inspector general report that it is \u201cclear\u201d the fix was in and those involved will not be prosecuted. \u201cWith everything we\u2019re learning from the inspector general\u2018s report, how is it conceivable that the attorney general and the president didn\u2019t know about it?\u201d asked Gingrich. \u201cSo, part 1 is to go back and look at 2015, 2016, and ask, given what a hands-on and dynamic president that Barack Obama was, do you really believe all these things happened and the attorney general and the president didn\u2019t know it?\u201d He continued, \u201cPart 2 \u2026 there\u2019s a story that the woman who tried to bribe her son into a university, that she and her husband got caught, that they\u2019re now facing 40 years in jail. Now, how can we not prosecute Comey? How can we not prosecute McCabe? How can we say that they\u2019ve done all the terrible things that the inspector general said they did, but they\u2019re somehow above the law? People are not going to have any faith in the system until people who are guilty are prosecuted and are treated like everybody else. People are not going to have any faith in the system. \u2026 It\u2019s clear that no matter how bad they were, the fix is in and they\u2019re not going to be prosecuted.\u201d Follow Trent Baker on Twitter\u00a0@MagnifiTrent",

      "subtitle": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) belittled working Americans during a\u00a0campaign stop in Hampton Falls, New Hampshire, Monday, suggesting that those who worked hard for their wealth or success did not make it happen on their own.",
      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " Warren campaigned in the Granite State on Labor Day, delivering a classic stump speech at a backyard event. She repeated typical portions of her life story to enthusiastic supporters, decried the influence of the Koch brothers in politics, and vowed to weed out corruption in Washington. Warren also talked about her plan to implement a monstrous \u201cwealth tax\u201d and belittled Americans who have worked hard to enjoy the fruits of their success, echoing former President Barack Obama\u2019s infamous \u201cyou didn\u2019t build that\u201d remarks circa 2012. \u201cWe need more power in the hands of workers. We need to make it easier to join a union and give the union smart power when they negotiate. Unions built America\u2019s middle class and they will rebuild America\u2019s middle class,\u201d Warren said, echoing tweets she penned earlier in the day. \u201cIt is time for a wealth tax in America,\u201d she continued before seemingly dismissing the hard work of individuals who enjoy the fruits of their labor. \u201cI\u2019m not proposing a wealth tax because I\u2019m cranky. Some of these guys say, \u2018I worked hard. I had a great idea. I worked late\u2019\u2013 oh yeah, unlike anybody else,\u201d she sarcastically stated. \u201cBut \u2018I worked late or\u00a0inherited wealth, and so this is mine.'\u201d She continued: And the answer is yeah, you did. Good for you. You did have a great idea and you did work hard. No one is angry about that, but here\u2019s the deal. You built a great fortune here in America. I guarantee you built it at least in part using workers all of us help pay to educate. Yeah. You built it at least in part, getting your goods to market on roads and bridges all of us helped pay to build. Yep. You built it at least in part, protected by police and firefighters all of us help pay their salaries. And we\u2019re are glad to do it. These are the investments we make as Americans. Warren\u2019s remarks were eerily\u00a0reminiscent of the sentiment pushed by Obama in 2012. He told a group at a campaign event in Roanoke, Virginia, that successful Americans \u201cdidn\u2019t get there\u201d on their own. Obama\u00a0said (emphasis added): There are a lot of wealthy, successful Americans who agree with me \u2014 because they want to give something back. They know they didn\u2019t \u2014 look, if you\u2019ve been successful, you didn\u2019t get there on your own. You didn\u2019t get there on your own. I\u2019m always struck by people who think, well, it must be because I was just so smart. There are a lot of smart people out there. It must be because I worked harder than everybody else. Let me tell you something \u2014 there are a whole bunch of hardworking people out there. If you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help. There was a great teacher somewhere in your life. Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system that we have that allowed you to thrive. Somebody invested in roads and bridges. If you\u2019ve got a business \u2014 you didn\u2019t build that. Somebody else made that happen. The Internet didn\u2019t get invented on its own. Government research created the Internet so that all the companies could make money off the Internet.  Warren has championed herself as one of the most pro-worker, pro-union Democrats in the crowded presidential field, but it remains unclear why she would espouse such a dismissive message toward hard-working Americans, particularly on Labor Day.",

      "subtitle": "A key revelation in the report released last week by the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general raises questions about the roles played by Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Susan Rice and other senior members of the Obama administration in disgraced former FBI Director James Comey\u2019s infamous classified briefing to then President-elect Donald Trump about \u201csalacious\u201d material inside the anti-Trump dossier.",
      "author": "Aaron Klein",
      "content": " As Breitbart News reported, the IG report relates that prior to the briefing, FBI members on Comey\u2019s team discussed the need to memorialize the exchanges between Comey and Trump during the private January 6, 2017 briefing in Trump Tower just in case Trump made statements relevant to the agency\u2019s controversial Russia probe. In other words, they plotted to stealthily use statements Trump said to Comey in a private briefing to inform their Russia collusion investigation. The IG further relates that Comey went on to do just that. He had a laptop waiting for him in the car, where he immediately began memorializing his private talk with Trump. He also immediately provided a \u201cquick download\u201d of the Trump briefing to members of \u201cCrossfire Hurricane\u201d \u2013 the FBI\u2019s compartmentalized Russia collusion team \u2014 via a secured video conference. The revelation that Comey immediately fed the details of his private meeting with Trump to the FBI team investigation unsubstantiated Russia collusion raises questions about what Obama, Biden, Rice and other Obama-era officials knew about the intent to use the planned briefing to fuel the questionable Russia investigation and surreptitiously pass the contents of the private talk to the FBI. In his book, A Higher Loyalty, Comey writes that he told Obama, Biden and Rice about his plans to have the private briefing with Trump.\u00a0 He did this on January 5, 2017 in a White House briefing with Obama one day before he met Trump and underhandedly sent the details of their one-on-one to the FBI\u2019s \u201cCrossfire Hurricane\u201d team handling the Russia collusion claims. Comey writes: After an extended discussion on the intelligence assessment, the president asked what the plan was for further briefings. Director Clapper explained that we were to meet the Gang of Eight the next morning\u2014the top officials in Congress, both Democrats and Republicans, briefed on intelligence matters\u2014and then we would go immediately to New York City to brief the president-elect and his senior team. Clapper explained to Obama that there was an unusual matter that needed to be brought to Mr. Trump\u2019s attention: additional material\u2014what would become commonly called \u201cthe Steele dossier\u201d\u2014that contained a variety of allegations about Trump. Comey writes that Obama specifically asked about the details of the \u201cplan\u201d to brief Trump: Obama did not appear to have any reaction to any of this\u2014at least none he would share with us. In a level voice, he asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the plan for that briefing?\u201d With just the briefest of sidelong glances at me, Clapper took a breath, then said, \u201cWe have decided that Director Comey will meet alone with the president-elect to brief him on this material following the completion of the full ICA briefing.\u201d The president did not say a word. Instead he turned his head to his left and looked directly at me. He raised and lowered both of his eyebrows with emphasis, and then looked away. I suppose you can read whatever you want into a wordless expression, but to my mind his Groucho Marx eyebrow raise was both subtle humor and an expression of concern. It was almost as if he were saying, \u201cGood luck with that.\u201d I began to feel a lump in my stomach\u2026 That same day, Comey writes, he received a call from Obama\u2019s Homeland Security Secretary, Jeh Johnson, further inquiring about the plan to brief Trump. Johnson was present at Comey\u2019s White House meeting with Obama earlier in the day. The ex-FBI chief relates: Later that day, I received a call from Jeh Johnson, the secretary of Homeland Security, who had been a friend since we were federal prosecutors together in Manhattan in the 1980s. He had been in the Oval Office that morning for the briefing.\u00a0 I have no idea whether he was calling me at President Obama\u2019s suggestion, or if the two even spoke about the matter, but he gave voice to how I viewed the Oval Office eyebrow raise. \u201cJim, I\u2019m worried about this plan for you to privately brief the president-elect,\u201d he said. \u201cMe, too,\u201d I replied. \u201cHave you ever met Donald Trump?\u201d he asked. \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cJim, please be careful. Be very careful. This may not go well.\u201d I thanked Jeh for the concern and the call. In their book, Russian Roulette: The Inside Story of Putin\u2019s War on America and the Election of Donald Trump, reporters Michael Isikoff and David Corn write about the briefing with Obama one day before Comey met with Trump. They document: On Thursday, January 5, 2017, the day before its public release, the intelligence chiefs briefed Obama and his senior staff. White House officials were taken aback. It was \u201cthe first time all the pieces came together for us,\u201d one senior official said. \u201cIt seemed a much grander conspiracy than it was during the election. This was an intelligence failure and a failure of the imagination.\u201d And when Biden was briefed about intelligence reports on the connections between various players in the Trump orbit and the Kremlin, he had a visceral reaction. \u201cIf this is true,\u201d he exclaimed, \u201cit\u2019s treason.\u201d A few days earlier, Rice had encouraged Clapper during the daily intelligence briefing to tell Obama about the \u201cgolden showers\u201d allegation. Obama turned to Rice and said, \u201cWhy am I hearing this?\u201d He was incredulous. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d he asked. Rice said the intelligence community had no idea if this story was true but that Obama needed to be aware the allegation was circulating. \u201cYou don\u2019t really expect to hear the term \u2018golden showers\u2019 in the President Daily Brief,\u201d a participant in this meeting later said, \u201cor that the guy who is going to become president may be a Manchurian candidate. Biden, Rice Involved in Early Stages of Russia Probe Biden and Rice were reportedly involved in the Russia probe since the early inception of the investigation.\u00a0Attorney General William Barr\u00a0 made a series of public comments that the U.S. administration\u2019s early handling of the Russia investigation may itself raise questions. He noted that it was first handled at a \u201cvery senior level\u201d and then by a \u201csmall group.\u201d Barr recently appointed a U.S. attorney to investigate the origins of the Russia collusion claims. Breitbart News previously reported that Biden was reportedly one of the few Obama administration officials who participated in secretive meetings during the early stages of the Obama-era intelligence community\u2019s initial operations regarding suspected Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign. Separately, Isikoff and Corn wrote in their book that Colin Kahl, who served as Biden\u2019s national security adviser, participated in highly compartmentalized early principals\u2019 meetings that took place at the White House to discuss the\u00a0 early stages of the Russia investigation. Biden was also documented as being present in the Oval Office for a conversation about the Russia probe between Obama, Comey, Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates and other senior officials, including Rice. In an action characterized as \u201codd\u201d last year by then-Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, Rice memorialized the confab in an email to herself describing Obama as starting \u201cthe conversation by stressing his continued commitment to ensuring that every aspect of this issue is handled by the Intelligence and law enforcement communities \u2018by the book.\u2019\u201d Grassley, in a letter to Rice, commented: \u201cIt strikes us as odd that, among your activities in the final moments on the final day of the Obama administration, you would feel the need to send yourself such an unusual email purporting to document a conversation involving President Obama and his interactions with the FBI regarding the Trump/Russia investigation.\u201d Grassley noted the unusual timing of the email sent by Rice to herself more than two weeks after the January 5, 2017 White House meeting on the Russia investigation, but mere hours before she vacated the White House for the incoming Trump administration. The email, Grassley documented, was sent by Rice to herself on Trump\u2019s inauguration day of January 20, 2017. Grassley wrote that \u201cdespite your claim that President Obama repeatedly told Mr. Comey to proceed \u2018by the book,\u2019 substantial questions have arisen about whether officials at the FBI, as well as at the Justice Department and the State Department, actually did proceed \u2018by the book.\u2019\u201d An attorney for Rice responded to Grassley\u2019s letter saying Rice wrote the email to herself with the goal of \u201cmemorializ[ing] an important national security discussion,\u201d since \u201cPresident Obama and his national security team were justifiably concerned about potential risks to the Nation\u2019s security from sharing highly classified information about Russia with certain members of the Trump transition team, particularly Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn.\u201d The attorney denied that the Steele dossier, financed by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign, was discussed in the Oval Office meeting. Regarding the time stamp on the email, the attorney said that noon was not accurate and that the email was sent in the morning \u201csince Ambassador Rice departed the White House shortly before noon on January 20.\u201d Still, Rice waited two weeks after the meeting to memorialize the conversation and sent the memo as one of her final acts in the White House on the last day. The attorney said that Rice waited until the last minute \u201cbecause that was the first opportunity she had to do so, given the particularly intense responsibilities of the National Security Advisor during the remaining days of the Administration and transition.\u201d Comey Passed Private Conversation with Trump to FBI Team Investigating Russia Hoax Meanwhile, addressing the revelation in the IG report that Comey immediately fed the details of his private briefing with Trump to the FBI\u2019s \u201cCrossfire Hurricane,\u201d Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif) charged on Fox News that what Comey was \u201creally doing\u201d was \u201cinterrogating the president and then using that information and feeding it right back into the \u2018Crossfire Hurricane\u2019 team at a time when \u2026 [Neither] Congress nor the president-elect knew he was under investigation.\u201d Until now, Comey and other former Obama administration officials presented the unusual briefing as a courtesy to Trump to warn him about the news media possibly publically releasing embarrassing claims about the newly elected president. \u00a0Questions have been raised on the need to include the dossier\u2019s wild and unsubstantiated charges in the classified briefings. It is not the usual job of the intelligence community to warn politicians about possible pending negative publicity. The IG report, based on interviews with Comey and other FBI \u201cwitnesses\u201d, documents that prior to Comey\u2019s briefing the FBI discussed utilizing Comey\u2019s classified private talk with Trump to inform the controversial Russia collusion probe. The report relates: Witnesses interviewed by the OIG also said that they discussed Trump\u2019s potential responses to being told about the \u201csalacious\u201d information, including that Trump might make statements about, or provide information of value to, the pending Russian interference investigation. That FBI counterintelligence investigation, known as \u201cCrossfire Hurricane,\u201d concerned whether individuals associated with the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election were coordinating with, or had been unwittingly co-opted by, the Russian government. Multiple FBI witnesses recalled agreeing ahead of time that Comey should memorialize his meeting with Trump immediately after it occurred. Comey told the OIG that, in his view, it was important for FBI executive managers to be \u201cable to share in [Comey\u2019s] recall of the\u2026salient details of those conversations.\u201d Another reason Comey provided for taking notes on his conversation with Trump was to \u201ccapture his\u2026contemporaneous recollection\u201d because there were \u201cmillions of ways that [the FBI] could get follow-up questions, or criticism\u2026and [Comey] wanted to recollect exactly, from his perspective, how it had taken place.\u201d Right after his briefing with Trump, Comey immediately updated the FBI team probing Russia collusion claims about his private talk with the incoming president, the IG documented: Comey told the OIG he began writing Memo 1 immediately following his meeting with Trump on January 6, 2017. Comey said he had a secure FBI laptop waiting for him in his FBI vehicle and that when he got into the vehicle, he was handed the laptop and \u201cbegan typing [Memo 1] as the vehicle moved.\u201d He said he continued working on Memo 1 until he arrived at the FBI\u2019s New York field office, where Comey gave a \u201cquick download\u201d of his conversation with President-elect Trump to Rybicki, McCabe, Baker, and supervisors of the FBI\u2019s Crossfire Hurricane investigative team via secure video teleconference (SVTC). Comey said he probably told the SVTC participants that he would send them his \u201cdetailed notes\u201d of the interaction. James Rybicki was Comey\u2019s chief of staff; Andrew McCabe was FBI deputy director; and James Baker was FBI counsel. A footnote in the report further relates: On January 7, 2017, Comey wrote a classified email to the other Intelligence Community Directors to let them know that his \u201cfollow-up session with [the President-elect] went well\u201d and provided them a brief summary of the conversation that was less detailed than Memo 1). Besides failing to inform Trump that he would be taking notes on his private briefing or that he would pass those notes to the FBI team investigating the Russia claims, Comey also used the briefing to assure Trump that he was not a subject of the FBI probe. In previous testimony, Comey admitted that he did not inform the incoming president about who financed the dossier.\u00a0 He also admitted in testimony that he was aware at the time that the dossier authored by former British spy Christopher Steele was financed by Democrats who opposed Trump.\u00a0 The dossier was paid for by Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign and the Democratic National Committee. Comey also previously stated that he pushed back against a request from Trump to possibly investigate the origins of \u201csalacious material\u201d \u2013 meaning the dossier \u2014 that the agency possessed in the course of its investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign.\u00a0 This even though Comey admitted to knowing it was financed by Trump\u2019s political opponents. Comey\u2019s classified briefing was subsequently leaked to the news media, with CNN on January 10, 2017 breaking the story that the contents of the dossier were presented during classified briefings one week earlier to Trump and then-President Barack Obama. Prior to CNN\u2019s report leaking the briefings, which was picked up by news agencies worldwide, the contents of the dossier had been circulating among news media outlets, but the sensational claims were largely considered too risky to publish. Comey\u2019s briefing seems to have provided the news media with the hook to publish a story on the controversial dossier containing the infamous \u201cRussian prostitute\u201d claims as well as unsubstantiated charges of collusion between Russia and members of Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign. Just after CNN\u2019s January 10 report on the classified briefings about the dossier, BuzzFeed infamously\u00a0published\u00a0the dossier\u2019s full unverified contents. The\u00a0New York Times\u00a0used CNN\u2019s story to report some contents of the dossier the same day as CNN\u2019s January 10 report on the briefings.

      "author": "Aaron Klein",
      "content": " The detail was contained in an extensive New York Times Magazine story titled \u201cThe Secret History of the Push to Strike Iran.\u201d The story says it is based on accounts with \u201cdozens of current and former American, Israeli and European officials,\u201d including many top officials cited on the record such as Netanyahu himself. One section cites Uzi Arad, a former top Netanyahu adviser, describing the scene after Netanyahu emerged from his first private Oval Office meeting with Obama. The section also quotes Netanyahu confirming that Obama \u201cadopted most of the Palestinian narrative.\u201d The Times reported: During their first meeting in the White House in May 2009, anxious aides waited outside the Oval Office as the two leaders met alone. It was an interminable meeting, and some may have figured that the savvy, experienced Israeli prime minister was lecturing the young American president about the Palestinians and the hard truths of Israeli security. But when the door opened, it was Netanyahu who appeared shellshocked, Arad recalls: \u201cBibi did not say anything, but he looked ashen.\u201d It was hours later when he told aides that Obama had attacked him and implored him \u2014 actually demanded him, in Netanyahu\u2019s view \u2014 to freeze Israel\u2019s settlements in the West Bank right away, with \u201cnot a single brick\u201d added in the future, according to an Israeli official with direct knowledge of the meeting. \u201cBibi left that place traumatized,\u201d Arad says. Speaking now, Netanyahu says that \u201cObama came from another direction, one that adopted most of the Palestinian narrative,\u201d and ruefully cites the \u201cnot a single brick\u201d line to argue that the American president was against him from the very beginning. (A former Obama-administration official with knowledge of the White House meeting says that Obama did not in fact use that phrase.) It is instrumental that the ex-Obama official only denied using the \u201cnot a single brick\u201d phrase in relation to Israeli settlements but did not deny that the former president, as Netanyahu put it, \u201cadopted most of the Palestinian narrative.\u201d Nor did the ex-Obama official deny the description of Obama using the meeting to demand a complete halt to all Jewish construction in Judea and Samaria, which houses historic Jewish communities. After their meeting, it was widely reported that Obama pressed for a total halt to Jewish construction in the West Bank. \u201cThe demand for a total stop to building is not something that can be justified and I don\u2019t think that anyone here at this table accepts it,\u201d Netanyahu was quoted as telling his cabinet one week after the Oval Office meeting.

      "author": "Haris Alic",
      "content": " The former vice president, who has worried even the staunchest of allies\u00a0with his frequent lapses on the campaign trail, made the slip-up when arguing there were \u201cnatural limits\u201d on constitutional rights like the Second Amendment. \u201cI\u2019m the only guy that\u2019s beaten the NRA, and my state is a big gun-owning state because of hunting,\u201d Biden told voters in Laconia, New Hampshire, before touting decades-long support for gun control. In particular, Biden highlighted his work authoring the initial assault weapons ban, which was part of his controversial 1994 crime bill. \u201cI\u2019m the only guy that\u2019s beaten them twice. I got assault weapons banned for ten years, it had to be reauthorized because of hanging chads in Florida,\u201d he said. \u201cThe last president said no, I\u2019m not going to reauthorize it.\u201d The statement struck many as confusing, since the most recent former occupant of the White House, Obama, was an avid supporter of gun control, especially prohibitions on firearms utilizing high-capacity magazines. Biden was likely referencing President George W. Bush, who in 2004 signaled he would not make renewing the 10-year-old ban a priority in an election year. Despite having publicly supported the ban in the past, Bush\u2019s lack of enthusiasm doomed efforts at reauthorization in the then-Republican controlled Congress.  This is the second time in less than a month that Biden has appeared to forget Obama, a man he has often fondly called his \u201cbrother,\u201d while campaigning. In August, Biden could not remember Obama\u2019s name when invoking his administration\u2019s legacy in dealing with Russia. \u201cThey invaded a significant portion of another country and annexed a significant portion of it called Crimea,\u201d Biden said when discussing Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine with voters in South Carolina. \u201cHe\u2019s saying it was President \u2014 my boss \u2014 it was his fault.\u201d The 76-year-old former vice president has also shown an inability to recollect\u00a0dates and places to the chagrin of some of his most prominent backers. Earlier this summer, Biden shocked the media establishment when he\u00a0claimed\u00a0to be vice president at the time of the\u00a0mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. \u201cThose kids in Parkland came up to see me when I was vice president,\u201d Biden said during a huddle with reporters in Iowa, before claiming that when the survivors visited Congress, lawmakers were \u201cbasically cowering, not wanting to see them. They did not want to face it on camera.\u201d The statement was quickly disproved as the shooting,\u00a0which resulted in 17 fatalities and over a dozen injuries, actually occurred on February 14, 2018 \u2014 more than a year after Biden left office. In response, Biden\u2019s team claimed the candidate had simply misspoken and pivoted to attacking the media for pushing it\u2019s own \u201cnarrative\u201d around the gaffes. \u201cThis is a press narrative, not a voter narrative,\u201d Biden\u2019s spokeswoman, Symone Sanders, asserted during an appearance on MSNBC. Sanders even went to the extent of lecturing the media on what it should and should not prioritize to \u201celevate the conversation\u201d surrounding the election. \u201cWe cannot allow this election to devolve in a tit for tat over name-calling and \u2018gaffes,\u2019 something that does not matter,\u201d she said. That argument, however, did not appear to sway many, including some of the left\u2019s most venerated journalists. Some, like Jamil Smith, a senior writer for\u00a0Rolling Stone\u00a0magazine, have even called on the former vice president\u2019s campaign to \u201cstep forward\u201d and explain \u201cwhat is going on with him.\u201d  In the last week alone, such suggestions have flourished as Biden\u2019s campaign struggles to dismiss controversy surrounding his fabrication of an emotional story about the war in Afghanistan. The controversy began when Biden told a story to more than 400 New Hampshire voters last month about how\u00a0he was asked\u00a0to travel to Afghanistan to honor a Navy captain during his tenure as vice president. As Biden recollected, he was asked by a four star general to travel to Kunar province in Afghanistan \u2014 \u201ca dangerous foray into \u2018godforsaken country\u2019\u201d \u2014 to honor an officer that \u201crappelled down a 60-foot ravine under fire and retrieved the body\u201d of a fallen comrade. When some suggested it might be too dangerous to send a sitting vice president into a war zone, Biden brushed away concerns for his own safety. \u201cWe can lose a vice president,\u201d he claimed to have said in response to such worries. \u201cWe can\u2019t lose many more of these kids. Not a joke.\u201d Apart from Biden supposedly putting his own life in jeopardy, the story was made more complicated as the officer in question did not want the honor being bestowed by his superiors. According to Biden, the captain was refusing the medal, a Silver Star, because he felt like a \u201cfailure\u201d because the comrade he was attempting to save died during the mission. \u201cHe said, \u2018Sir, I don\u2019t want the damn thing!\u2019\u201d Biden, his jaw clenched and nearly shouting, relayed to the audience in New Hampshire. \u201c\u2019Do not pin it on me, Sir! Please, Sir. Do not do that! He died. He died!\u2019\u201d Biden\u2019s emotional telling of the story left those in the audience \u201csilent\u201d and visibly moved. Unfortunately for the former vice president, though,\u00a0The Washington Post\u00a0found \u201calmost every detail of the story\u201d to be \u201cincorrect\u201d upon closer investigation. Biden visited Kunar province in 2008 as a U.S. senator, not as vice president. The service member who performed the celebrated rescue that Biden described was a 20-year-old Army specialist, not a much older Navy captain. And that soldier, Kyle J. White, never had a Silver Star, or any other medal, pinned on him by Biden. At a White House ceremony six years after Biden\u2019s visit, White stood at attention as President Barack Obama placed a Medal of Honor, the nation\u2019s highest award for valor, around his neck. In fact, the paper concluded that Biden had conflated three separate stories, including one in which he actually \u201cdid pin a medal on a heartbroken soldier, Army Staff Sgt. Chad Workman, who didn\u2019t believe he deserved the award.\u201d \u201cIn the space of three minutes, Biden got the time period, the location, the heroic act, the type of medal, the military branch and the rank of the recipient wrong, as well as his own role in the ceremony,\u201d the\u00a0Post\u00a0reported. Upon the story breaking, Biden\u2019s team immediately sought to downplay and dismiss the controversy. Biden, himself, asserted the central points of his story were accurate, even if the details were not. He even went to\u00a0 claim details are not an important part within the confines of the presidency. \u201cThe details are irrelevant in terms of decision-making,\u201d Biden explained to NPR this past week when asked if his fuzziness with specifics was problematic for anyone aspiring to be commander in chief. All of this has left Biden\u2019s surrogates and allies wondering if the former vice president would be benefited by fewer public appearances and less speaking time on the stump. \u201cI think Vice President Biden needs to speak less, and listen more, and let people talk,\u201d Iowa State Senator Tony Bisignano, one of the former vice president\u2019s top backers, told Politico on Friday.",

      "subtitle": "Seven years after the September 11, 2012 attacks on the U.S. Special Mission in Benghazi, it is instructive to recall the Obama administration\u2019s altering of the now infamous talking points utilized to essentially mislead the American public about the coordinated assault that resulted in the deaths of Ambassador to Libya J. Christopher Stevens and three other US. Citizens.",
      "author": "Aaron Klein",
      "content": " The controversy surrounded the removal of references to terrorism while stressing an obscure anti-Islam film despite knowing it had little to nothing to do with the motivation for the assault. \u00a0The Obama administration\u2019s decision to publicize and even use taxpayer dollars to apologize for the Muhammad film while deceptively blaming it for the attacks likely helped to stir riots across the Islamic world by drawing attention to the previous unknown anti-Muhammad film. Some of the same personalities involved in the Benghazi talking points scandal would later play central roles in the Obama-era intelligence community\u2019s controversial investigation into collusion claims between Russia and President Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign. The curious tale of the talking points began when U.S. intelligence officials testified behind closed doors in early November 2012 and were asked point blank whether they had altered the points on which then-United Nations Ambassador Susan Rice based her original statements to the public about the Benghazi attacks. On Sunday, Sept. 16, 2012, Rice had appeared on five morning television programs to offer the official Obama administration response to the Benghazi attacks. In nearly identical statements, she asserted that the attacks were a spontaneous protest in response to a \u201chateful video.\u201d Other Obama administration officials made similar claims. Four days after Rice\u2019s misinformation, Obama himself was questioned on Sep. 20, about whether the Benghazi attack was carried out by terrorists.\u00a0 He Obama responded, \u201cWhat we do know is that the natural protests that arose because of the outrage over the video were used as an excuse by extremists to see if they can also directly harm U.S. interests.\u201d He was pressed at a town hall event hosted by Univision about whether al Qaeda was behind the assault, replying, \u201cWell, we don\u2019t know yet.\u201d It would later emerge the talking points were edited to remove references to \u201cterrorism\u201d and \u201cal-Qaeda\u201d in the attacks. The administration also removed information about at least five other previous attacks against foreign interests in Benghazi. An original draft stating, \u201cWe do know that Islamic extremists with ties to al-Qa\u2019ida participated in the attack\u201d was changed to \u201cwe know that they [Islamic extremists] \u00a0participated in the protests.\u201d\u00a0 Another bullet changed the word \u201cattack\u201d to \u201cviolent demonstrations.\u201d Surveillance video from the mission later showed there were no significant popular protests on September 11, 2012. Greggory Hicks, the No. 2 U.S. official in Libya at the time of the Sept. 11, 2012, attacks, testified that he knew immediately the attacks were terror strikes, not a protest turned violent. According to Hicks, \u201ceverybody in the mission\u201d believed it was an act of terror \u201cfrom the get-go.\u201d Two congressional sources who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity said Mike Morell, then acting CIA director, along with Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, and National Counterterrorism Center Director Matthew Olsen each testified behind closed doors that they did not alter the talking points.\u00a0 On Nov. 16, 2012, former CIA director David Petraeus testified before the same congressional intelligence committee and also replied no to the question of whether he had changed the talking points, three congressional sources told Reuters. Then on Nov. 27 the CIA reportedly told lawmakers that it had in fact changed the wording of the unclassified talking points to delete a reference to al-Qaida, according to senators who met with Morell that day. That Nov. 27 meeting was between Morell, Rice and Sens. Lindsey Graham and Kelly Ayotte and the late John McCain. A statement by McCain, Graham and Ayotte specifically related that Morell told the senators during the meeting that the FBI had removed references to al-Qaida from the talking points \u201cand did so to prevent compromising an ongoing criminal investigation\u201d of the attack on the U.S. mission. The senators\u2019 joint statement specifically reads: \u201cAround 10:00 this morning in a meeting requested by Ambassador Rice, accompanied by acting CIA Director Mike Morell, we asked Mr. Morell who changed the unclassified talking points to remove references to al-Qaida. In response, Mr. Morell said the FBI removed the references and did so to prevent compromising an ongoing criminal investigation. We were surprised by this revelation and the reasoning behind it.\u201d Morell\u2019s likely misleading claim was repeated to the news media. On Nov. 28, 2012, Sharyl Attkisson, then at CBS News, quoted the CIA stating the edits to the talking points were made \u201cso as not to tip off al-Qaida as to what the U.S. knew, and to protect sources and methods.\u201d\u00a0 That same report quoted a source from the Office of the Director for National Intelligence, aka James Clapper, telling CBS News\u2019 Margaret Brennan that Clapper\u2019s office made the edits as part of the interagency process because the links to al-Qaida were deemed too \u201ctenuous\u201d to make public. Meanwhile, a few hours after his meeting with the senators, Morell\u2019s office reportedly contacted Graham and stated that Morell \u201cmisspoke\u201d in the earlier meeting and that it was, in fact, the CIA, not the FBI, that deleted the al-Qaida references. \u201cThey were unable to give a reason as to why,\u201d stated Graham of the strange about face.\u00a0 \u201cCIA officials contacted us and indicated that Acting Director Morell misspoke in our earlier meeting. The CIA now says that it deleted the al-Qaida references, not the FBI. They were unable to give a reason as to why,\u201d Graham said in a statement. An intelligence official called Morell\u2019s change \u201can honest mistake and it was corrected as soon as it was realized. There is nothing more to this.\u201d\u00a0 A U.S. intelligence official further told CBS News there was \u201cabsolutely no intent to misinform.\u201d The official claimed the talking points \u201cwere never meant to be definitive and, in fact, noted that the assessment may change. The points clearly reflect the early indications of extremist involvement in a direct result. It wasn\u2019t until after they were used in public that analysts reconciled contradictory information about how the assault began.\u201d Graham at the time went so far as to suggest he would hold up the nomination of Morell if Obama had nominated him to be the CIA director, a position ultimately filled by John Brennan. All of the sudden, in June 2013, Morell announced he was stepping down to spend more time with his family. In a statement, Morell acknowledged that his reason for stepping down may seem somewhat difficult to swallow, but \u201cwhen I say that it is time for my family, nothing could be more real than that.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 Morell served 33 years in the agency and was a frontrunner for CIA director.\u00a0 Morell later reemerged as a counselor to Beacon Global Strategies, a consult group particularly close to Hillary Clinton.\u00a0 The firm is led by Philippe I. Reines, who served from 2009 to 2013 as Clinton\u2019s Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Strategic Communications and Senior Communications Advisor. In February 2014 a bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee report revealed that Morell was in receipt of critical information on Sep. 15, 2012, one day before Rice used the talking points publically. The report said that Morell and others at the CIA received an email from the CIA\u2019s Libya station chief stating the attacks were \u201cnot/not an escalation of protests.\u201d\u00a0 So on the same day Morell helped to edit the talking points by calling the attacks a \u201cdemonstration,\u201d he received information from his own station chief clearly contradicting this claim. FoxNews.com quoted Sam Faddis, an expert on the U.S. intelligence community, explaining, \u201cThe chief of station is the senior intelligence officer for the entire United States government\u2026You would really have to have some incredibly overwhelming factual evidence to disregard that and there is no indication of that in the report at all.\u201d In perhaps one of the most damning sections of a Republican House Interim Progress Report on the events in Benghazi, lawmakers who penned the investigation wrote they were given access to classified emails and other communications that prove the talking points were not edited to protect classified information but instead to protect the Clinton State Department\u2019s reputation. \u201cEvidence rebuts administration claims that the talking points were modified to protect classified information or to protect an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI),\u201d the report states, directly contradicting Morell\u2019s claims. The report charges that the talking points were \u201cdeliberately\u201d edited to \u201cprotect the State Department.\u201d It is instructive to briefly quote the report: To protect the State Department, the administration deliberately removed references to al-Qaida-linked groups and previous attacks in Benghazi in the talking points used by [United Nations] Ambassador [Susan] Rice, thereby perpetuating the deliberately misleading and incomplete narrative that the attacks evolved from a demonstration caused by a YouTube video. Senior State Department officials requested \u2013 and the White House approved \u2013 that the details of the threats, specifics of the previous attacks, and previous warnings be removed to insulate the department from criticism that it ignored the threat environment in Benghazi. The report authors said that they went through email exchanges of the interagency process to scrub the talking points. They wrote the emails do not reveal any concern with protecting classified information. \u201cAdditionally, the bureau (FBI) itself approved a version of the talking points with significantly more information about the attacks and previous threats than the version that the State Department requested. Thus, the claim that the State Department\u2019s edits were made solely to protect that investigation is not credible.\u201d In a particularly stinging accusation, the report states that when draft talking points were sent to officials throughout the executive branch, senior State Department officials requested the talking points be changed \u201cto avoid criticism for ignoring the threat environment in Benghazi.\u201d \u201cSpecifically, State Department emails reveal senior officials had \u2018serious concerns\u2019 about the talking points, because members of Congress might attack the State Department for \u2018not paying attention to agency warnings\u2019 about the growing threat in Benghazi. Deceiving the American public is bad enough. Adding insult to injury, the Obama administration\u2019s decision to blame the Muhammad film for alleged protests served to further inflame the Islamic world against the U.S., leading to deadly rioting. The administration even spent $70,000 in taxpayer funds on an ad campaign denouncing an anti-Muhammad film. The ads reportedly aired on seven Pakistani networks. They also came in response to protests in Pakistan that were reportedly a reaction to the film. However, it was the claim of popular protests in Benghazi at the time that garnered the biggest public reaction from the White House. The Sept. 19, 2012, ads featured Obama and Hillary Clinton making statements against the film in the wake of the Benghazi attacks. \u201cSince our founding, the United States has been a nation of respect, that respects all faiths. We reject all efforts to denigrate the religious beliefs of others,\u201d Obama says in the ad, which was stamped \u201cpaid content.\u201d Clinton then denies any official U.S. involvement in producing the \u201cInnocence of Muslims\u201d video. \u201cWe absolutely reject its contents,\u201d she says. Meanwhile, some of the same personalities involved in the Benghazi talking points scandal played key roles in perpetuating the Russia collusion narrative. Clinton\u2019s campaign, of course, funded the anti-Trump dossier produced by GPS and reportedly utilized by the FBI as a \u201croadmap\u201d for its questionable collusion probe. Brennan\u2019s CIA reportedly convened a \u201csecret task force at CIA headquarters composed of several dozen analysts and officers from the CIA, the NSA and the FBI\u201d that formed the early stages of the Russia probe, stages now under investigation by the Trump administration. Brennan and Clapper were among the few Obama-era officials originally allowed access to the Russia intelligence, according to the Washington Post. Disgraced ex-FBI Director James Comey, Brennan and Clapper are the subjects of a dispute over which top Obama administration officials advocated for the infamous, Clinton-funded Steele dossier to be utilized as evidence in the Russia collusion investigation. The argument recently erupted into the open with a Brennan surrogate being quoted in the news media opposing Comey not long after Attorney General William Barr appointed a U.S. attorney to investigate the origins of the Russia collusion claims. Rice, also involved in the talking points scandal, was documented as being present in the Oval Office for a controversial briefing about the Russia probe. In an action characterized as \u201codd\u201d last year by then-Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, Rice memorialized the confab in an email to herself describing Obama as starting \u201cthe conversation by stressing his continued commitment to ensuring that every aspect of this issue is handled by the Intelligence and law enforcement communities \u2018by the book.\u2019\u201d In actions connected to the Russia investigation, Rice reportedly unmasked senior members of Trump\u2019s presidential campaign.

      "subtitle": "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu implied that a former strategist for Barack Obama currently working for the Blue and White party in Israel was behind a Politico report claiming the U.S. government concluded that Israel was \u201cmost likely\u201d behind the placement of cellphone snooping devices purportedly found in the vicinity of the White House.",
      "author": "Breitbart Jerusalem",
      "content": " Politico\u2019s anonymously sourced article, which claims Israeli intelligence under Netanyahu\u2019s administration spied on the Trump administration, was released just days before a critical election in Israel. The wild claim does not cite any U.S. government agency but instead relies upon \u201cthree former senior U.S. officials with knowledge of the matter\u201d who purport to know that the \u201cU.S. government concluded within the past two years that Israel was most likely behind the placement of cellphone surveillance devices that were found near the White House and other sensitive locations around Washington.\u201d The Israeli government has strongly denied the allegations. A senior U.S. official was quoted as saying the Politico story \u201cis completely false. Absolutely false. I checked.\u201d President Trump himself said of the story: \u201cI find that hard to believe.\u201d Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Trump further said, \u201cI don\u2019t believe that. No, I don\u2019t believe that the Israelis are spying on us.\u201d On Friday, Netanyahu released a campaign ad promoting a Fox News segment from last week in which radio star and weekend cable host Mark Levin said Joel Benenson was behind the Politico piece. Benenson was a strategist for Obama\u2019s 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns and served as chief strategist for Hillary Clinton\u2019s failed 2016 campaign. He is currently advising Netanyahu\u2019s main opponent, Benny Gantz, and Gantz\u2019s Blue and White party. \u201cYesterday you heard the lies that Israel tried to spy on the White House, a complete lie,\u201d Netanyahu began in the Hebrew-language campaign video. Netanyahu cited Levin as saying \u201cthis is exactly like the tricks carried out by Joel Benenson. He was an adviser to Obama and now he is the adviser to [Blue and White leaders Benny] Gantz and [Yair] Lapid.\u201d \u201cFor them everything is kosher,\u201d added Netanyahu. \u201cThey are willing to do anything\u00a0 and don\u2019t care if they damage this valuable asset, our relationship with the United States and my relationship with the president.\u201d \u201cEverything is kosher to garner an extra few votes and bring in a left-wing government. Don\u2019t believe these lies,\u201d Netanyahu stated. Blue and White co-founder Yair Lapid strongly rejected the charge about Benenson and claimed that Netanyahu had \u201cgone off the rails.\u201d \u201cYesterday we supported Bibi over the eavesdropping allegation, today he said we instigated it. Never mind being a liar, what about some national responsibility? The man has gone off the rails,\u201d tweeted Lapid. Breitbart\u2019s Aaron Klein took a closer look at the Politico story, writing that the alleged plot \u201creveals glaring red flags.\u201d The Politico story by Daniel Lippman charges: The miniature surveillance devices, colloquially known as \u201cStingRays,\u201d mimic regular cell towers to fool cellphones into giving them their locations and identity information. Formally called international mobile subscriber identity-catchers or IMSI-catchers, they also can capture the contents of calls and data use. The devices were likely intended to spy on President Donald Trump, one of the former officials said, as well as his top aides and closest associates \u2014 though it\u2019s not clear whether the Israeli efforts were successful. Klein noted that a reader needs to scroll down a full 28 paragraphs to arrive at the detail that such IMSI-catchers can also be made by \u201csophisticated hobbyists\u201d or those willing to pay more than $150,000 for each device. Lippman allows: IMSI-catchers, which are often used by local police agencies to surveil criminals, can also be made by sophisticated hobbyists or by the Harris Corp., the manufacturer of StingRays, which cost more than $150,000 each, according to Vice News. Writes Klein: \u201cSo we are to believe that technology behemoth Israel, with some of the most capable and proven minds in high-tech, risked blowing up its relationship with its closest and most important ally by recklessly planting physical spying devices near the White House that \u201ccan also be made by sophisticated hobbyists.\u201d A simple Google search under \u2018IMSI catcher\u2019 turns up less sophisticated devices for as low as $249.95 and countless websites describing how to make IMSIs.\u201d \u201cThe improbable plot gets even more absurd,\u201d continued Klein. The Breitbart Jerusalem bureau chief pointed to a story from September 2014 in which CNBC first exclusively reported about a technology company that discovered \u201cas many as 15 cellphone interception devices secretly operating in the nation\u2019s capital, capable of illicitly identifying the movements of prominent people, recording audio from mobile phones, listening to calls and reading email.\u201d CNBC reported on the IMSI-catchers and even spent an afternoon driving around Washington with experts \u201cwhose devices registered several malicious attempts to probe the phones.\u201d The news agency related that they contacted the FBI and Department of Justice to seek comment on the discovery of the devices. The CNBC reporter who authored the story, Eamon Javers, tweeted on Thursday that Politico\u2019s Lippman \u201cprovides a likely answer to a mystery I first reported on back in 2014 \u2013 Who\u2019s hacking DC\u2019s cell phones?\u201d Lippman himself retweeted Javers\u2019 tweet linking his 2014 article on IMSI-catchers in D.C. to Politico\u2019s story citing former officials as claiming that Israel was operating such devices in America\u2019s capital to spy on Trump. Klein posited: So we are to believe that Israel risked spying on the Trump administration using devices that were not only planted in the open but similar to or even the same as the IMSI-catchers in D.C. first reported in the news media five years ago. And, according to this outlandish narrative, Israel continued to deploy such easily discoverable devices for years even after CNBC revealed those attempts and publicly reported that it alerted the FBI about the IMSI-catchers. We are to further believe that Israel has been spying in D.C. using devices so unsophisticated that civilian experts cited by CNBC in 2014 discovered similar snooping attempts with just one afternoon drive around the Capital. Color me skeptical.",

      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " Ginsburg, who has faced a number of medical battles in recent years, appeared at an event in New York City Wednesday with\u00a0NPR\u2019s Nina Totenberg and addressed the critics who say she should have taken the opportunity to retire when Obama was in office and in a position to appoint a progressive judge in her place. \u201cWhen that suggestion is made, I ask the question: Who do you think the president could nominate that could get through the Republican Senate, who you would prefer on the court than me?\u201d Ginsburg said, according to CNBC. The 86-year-old Supreme Court justice was recently treated for pancreatic cancer, which was discovered during a blood test in July. Ginsburg underwent radiation therapy at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City last month:  Doctors said at the time the rest of her body is cancer-free, and the justice told a crowd at the National\u00a0Book Festival in Washington D.C. she is on her way to being \u201cvery well\u201d:  That has not been Ginsburg\u2019s only health battle. As Breitbart News reported: Ginsburg, the liberal face of the Supreme Court, has fought cancer on and off for roughly two decades. She underwent a procedure to remove malignant nodules from her left lung on December 21st of last year. The cancerous growths were discovered while receiving treatment for a fall in her office. Ginsburg missed the court\u2019s oral arguments for several days in February, participating in cases using transcripts \u2014 a first in the justice\u2019s 25-year tenure on the bench. Ginsburg has experienced several health issues in recent years. The justice underwent cancer surgeries in 1999 and 2009 and broke her ribs in at least two separate occasions. In 2014, Ginsburg had a stent inserted into her heart. Despite her health issues, Ginsburg signaled no signs of retiring, telling Totenberg that her job keeps her going. \u201cThis is my fourth cancer bout, and I found each time that when I am active I am much better than when I am just lying about feeling sorry for myself,\u201d Ginsburg explained. \u201cThe necessity to get up and go is stimulating. And somehow, all these appearances I\u2019ve had since the end of August, whatever my temporary disability is, it stops, and I\u2019m okay for the event,\u201d she continued, echoing the remarks she made at D.C\u2019s\u00a0National\u00a0Book Festival in August. \u201cIt\u2019s the best and the hardest job I\u2019ve ever had. It has kept me going through four cancer bouts. Instead of concentrating on my aches and pains, I just know that I have to read this set of briefs,\u201d she said.",

      "content": " In a State Department announcement on Thursday, officials said that the annual refugee resettlement ceiling would be lowered from its current 30,000 to 18,000 for Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 \u2014 which runs from October 1, 2019, to September 30, 2020.\u00a0This is merely a numerical limit and not a goal federal officials are supposed to reach. State Department officials said they expect to process more than 350,000 foreign nationals in new asylum cases next year; thus, a reduction in refugee resettlement offsets this historically high humanitarian immigration level. \u201cThe proposed FY 2020 refugee ceiling, as outlined by the president, takes into account our existing and anticipated humanitarian workload on all fronts and fulfills our primary duty to protect and serve U.S. citizens,\u201d Acting Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Ken Cuccinelli said in a statement. The lowering of the refugee resettlement cap to a maximum of 18,000 admissions next year will be at least a 78 to 80 percent decrease of the inflow of refugees that Obama allowed into the country in his last full fiscal year. For example, for FY 2016, Obama\u2019s State Department admitted close to 85,000 refugees into the country. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s State Department is set to admit less than 30,000 refugees this fiscal year, reducing the burden that the refugee resettlement program has placed on America\u2019s working and middle class, as well as on small U.S. communities that have been forced to absorb enormous levels of refugees since 1980. As Breitbart News has reported, the U.S. has permanently resettled more than 1.7 million foreign nationals and refugees through a variety of humanitarian programs \u2014 a foreign population larger than the size of Philadelphia, which has 1.5 million residents. These 1.7 million foreign nationals and refugees do not include the roughly\u00a0445,000 foreign nationals who have been allowed to remain in the U.S. through the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program. Refugee resettlement costs American taxpayers nearly $9 billion every five years, according to the latest research. Over the course of five years, an estimated 16 percent of all refugees admitted will need housing assistance paid for by taxpayers. John Binder is a reporter\u00a0for Breitbart News.

      "content": " McCarthy notes the double standard \u2014 that Democrats want to impeach Trump for doing what Obama did \u2014 and which they have been telling the world for years was necessary to do to protect American national security. As House Intelligence Committee chair Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) told\u00a0NBC News in March, his investigation into Trump dealt with\u00a0\u201ca present threat to our national security \u2014 whether the president and anybody around him are compromised by a foreign power.\u201d If Trump colluded with Russia, or if the Russians had compromising information about him, they could hold enormous influence over the Trump administration \u2014 hence the need for investigation. That is how Democrats defended the decision by intelligence and law enforcement officials under President Obama to conduct surveillance of Trump campaign associates \u2014 without warning Trump himself in a \u201cdefensive\u201d briefing. McCarthy notes that \u201cthe Obama administration\u2019s law-enforcement agencies pressured their Ukrainian counterparts to revive a dormant corruption investigation of Paul Manafort\u201d in the middle of the 2016 presidential election. He cites his recent book,\u00a0Ball of\u00a0Collusion: The Plot to Rig an Election and Destroy a Presidency, recently excerpted on Fox News, which reports that Obama administration officials urged Ukrainian prosecutors to investigate Manafort \u2014 which amounted to \u201ceffectively meddling in the American presidential election.\u201d The results were soon clear: leaks about Manafort\u2019s activities in Ukraine began to appear in the U.S. media, spun in the worst possible light. He was replaced at the Trump campaign and became a target in the phony \u201ccollusion\u201d narrative. McCarthy notes the glaring double standard: \u201cWhen the Obama administration leans on Ukraine for help in an investigation of political opponents, the Democrats and the media say, \u201cBut look how corrupt Paul Manafort was!\u201d When the Trump administration leans on Ukraine for help in an investigation of political opponents, the Democrats and the media say, \u201cAbuse of power \u2014 impeach him!\u201d Two key differences: there is\u00a0actual evidence of former Vice President Joe Biden extorting the Ukrainian government; and Trump has released the transcript of his conversation with the new Ukrainian president. Only one administration has been transparent. Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

      "content": " A new book claims that Obama endorsed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton instead of Biden in 2016 because he was \u201cjust another white guy.\u201d \u201cJoe, despite his many virtues, was just another white guy, one in a long line of American presidents \u2014 hardly the symbol of the Teutonic change that Obama hoped would mark his place in the history books,\u201d wrote author Steven Levingston in a new book, according to the Daily Mail. Levingston is the nonfiction editor of the Washington Post,\u00a0and has authored books about former President John F. Kennedy. His new book,\u00a0Barack and Joe: The Making of an Extraordinary Partnership\u00a0is scheduled for release on October 8. \u201cBarack had placed his bet on Hillary, the one he believed would confirm his revolutionary stamp on American\u2019s political culture \u2013 the first black president passing the baton to the first woman president,\u201d he wrote. The book notes that Obama did not endorse Biden for president in 2020 either, marking a blow to his former vice president who routinely cites Obama\u2019s legacy on the campaign trail. Biden was also stung by the fact that Obama was meeting with potential presidential candidates such as former Rep. Robert Francis \u201cBeto\u201d O\u2019Rourke, according to Livingston. The New York Times also reported in August that Obama told Biden, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this, Joe,\u201d referring to a conversation he had with his former vice president, and asked Biden\u2019s aids to not let the former vice president embarrass himself.

      "subtitle": "FBI data shows that President Donald Trump has helped save more than 1,000 lives by reversing the crime wave that emerged amid President Barack Obama\u2019s crackdown on state and local police forces.",
      "author": "Neil Munro",
      "content": " Nationwide, homicides spiked to 15,195 in 2016, up from 12,278 murders in 2014 when Obama and his progressive and media allies began blaming police forces for multiple episodes in which young black men were killed. Since then, Trump has ended the White House support for the Black Lives Matter movement, and the number of murders was forced down to 14,123 in 2018, according to new FBI data.\u00a0The murder rate dropped by 6.8 percent from 2017 to 2018. The combined reduction in murders in 2017 and 2018 adds up to roughly 1,318 Americans who did not die from murder since Obama\u2019s departure in early 2017. The savings amount to approximately two fewer dead each day.\u00a0A large percentage of the people who did not die are African-American. If Obama had kept the murder rate at the 2014 level, 9,304 Americans would not have been murdered from 2015 to 2018. Overall, the violent crime rate fell by 3.3 percent\u00a0from 2017 to 2018, after rising by 4.7 percent from 2014. The violent crime rate is down nine percent from 2009, despite Obama\u2019s crime increase. The FBI data provides details about national arrests\u00a0and city arrests\u00a0by race and ethnic group. But the FBI did not provide easy access to data about the number of white, black, or Latino victims. In late 2017, crime expert Heather McDonald\u00a0blamed\u00a0the extra dead on the Democrats\u2019 \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d campaign to stigmatize and regulate cops. The campaign began when Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder intervened in the 2014\u00a0Ferguson riots, shortly before the 2014 midterm elections. Who is killing these black victims? Not whites, and not the police, but other blacks. In 2016, the police fatally shot 233 blacks, the vast majority armed and dangerous, according to the\u00a0Washington Post. The\u00a0Post\u00a0categorized only 16 black male victims of police shootings as \u201cunarmed\u201d \u2026 The reason for the current increase is what I have called the\u00a0Ferguson Effect. Cops are backing off of proactive policing in high-crime minority neighborhoods, and criminals are becoming emboldened. Having been told incessantly by politicians, the media, and Black Lives Matter activists that they are bigoted for getting out of their cars and questioning someone loitering on a known drug corner at 2\u00a0AM, many officers are instead just driving by. Such stops are discretionary; cops don\u2019t have to make them. And when political elites demonize the police for just such proactive policing, we shouldn\u2019t be surprised when cops get the message and do less of it. Seventy-two percent of the nation\u2019s officers say that they and their colleagues are now less willing to stop and question suspicious persons, according to a Pew Research\u00a0poll\u00a0released in January 2016. The reason is the persistent anti-cop climate. Local police chiefs and former FBI Director James Comey also complained about the political and media pressure on street cops.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know whether that explains it entirely, but I do have a strong sense that some part of the explanation is a chill wind that has blown through American law enforcement over the last year,\u201d James Comey in a 2015\u00a0speech at the University of Chicago Law School. \u201cWe have allowed our Police Department to get fetal, and it is having a direct consequence,\u201d Chicago\u2019s Democratic Mayor, Rahm Emanuel,\u00a0said\u00a0during an October 2015 event.\u00a0\u201cThey have pulled back from the ability to interdict \u2026 they don\u2019t want to be a news story themselves, they don\u2019t want their career ended early, and it\u2019s having an impact,\u201d\u00a0he added. \u201cThe media, academia, and some police officials are again twisting themselves into knots to deny that de-policing is responsible for the ongoing violent-crime increase,\u201d \u00a0McDonald\u00a0reported. She continued: The strong version of what\u00a0I have called the Ferguson Effect\u2014a drop in proactive policing leading to rising crime\u2014is the only explanation for the crime increase that matches the data. The country has just elected a new president who\u00a0understands that the false narrative about the police\u00a0has led to the breakdown of law and order in inner cities. If the crime situation improves in the coming year, it will be because Black Lives Matter calumnies no longer have an echo chamber in the White House and because cops on the beat believe that they will now be supported for trying to restore order where\u00a0informal social control has broken down. Read the FBI data here\u00a0and here.",

      "author": "Edwin Mora",
      "content": " Members of the Obama administration also reportedly\u00a0retaliated against whistleblowers, namely those linked to the federal government\u2019s gun-walking scandal known as Operation Fast and Furious. Until Obama took power, the government had almost entirely reserved the Espionage Act for spies. Referring to the former president on January 13, 2017, the Washington Times noted, \u201cWhen he entered office in 2009 and waged a war against this community.\u201d Meanwhile, other apparent leaks, made by individuals described by the Guardian as \u201cadministration insiders\u201d in March 2015, went \u201centirely unpunished or\u201d were \u201ctreated, as in\u00a0the case of General David Petraeus, as misdemeanors.\u201d As of late June, President Donald Trump\u2019s administration had indicted three potential whistleblowers under the Espionage Act. At least two of the defendant\u00a0whistleblowers\u00a0pleaded guilty to violating the Espionage Act, the Reporters Without Borders group noted in May. The Obama administration, however, is known for normalizing the use of the statute against journalists\u2019 sources in the government. Even the liberal Washington Post noted early in the Trump administration, \u201cTrump rages about leakers. Obama quietly prosecuted them.\u201d Nevertheless, Democrats have blasted Trump for lambasting intelligence community information leakers that triggered House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry as spies. On Wednesday, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) told reporters that Trump\u2019s attack on the CIA \u201cwhistleblower\u201d that triggered the impeachment investigation is unacceptable. Trump\u2019s comparison of the \u201cwhistleblower\u2019s\u201d source as a \u201cspy\u201d amounts to an \u201cincitement of violence,\u201d Schiff said. In a joint press conference with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), Schiff added that Trump wants to characterize the whistleblower as \u201ctreasonous,\u201d adding: Let\u2019s not make a mistake here, the president wants to make this all about the whistleblower and suggest that people come forward with evidence of his wrongdoing are somehow treasonous and should be treated as traitors and spies. Schiff, who came into office in 2013, has been silent about Obama using the Espionage Act to target whistleblowers. Individuals prosecuted under Obama include U.S. Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning. In May 2017, the government released Manning after serving only seven out of a 35-year sentence for leaking thousands of military and U.S. Department of State documents to WikiLeaks in 2010. Obama also used the Espionage Act to charge Edward Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor, who remains in Russia. Under Obama, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) targeted whistleblowers for leaking information to journalists and even attempted to prosecute the reporters who received and published the data. The Washington Times pointed out: Mr. Obama\u2019s Department of Justice and FBI spied on The Associated Press, secretly wading through their reporters\u2019 phone records, in an effort to chill potential federal whistleblowers. His administration targeted Fox News reporter James Rosen as a criminal co-conspirator under the Espionage Act for simply talking to one of his sources in the State Department and reporting on it. Near the end of his administration, it appeared the former president had a change of heart and showed an interest in protecting government whistleblowers and other official leakers. He implemented executive-branch directives and signed a bill into law to protect whistleblowers and members of the inspector general community.",

      "author": "John Nolte",
      "content": " While it\u2019s true that Trump\u2019s approval rating was climbing, and climbed to 45 percent in the Real Clear Politics poll of polls prior to the media and Democrats launching their coordinated impeachment blitzkrieg, as of now it sits at 43.4 percent, not even two points lower. What\u2019s more, Trump disapproval rating has barely increased, from 52 percent to 53.6 percent. And as of late, in fact, Trump\u2019s numbers have actually improved slightly: a half point increase in approval and a half point decrease in disapproval. Overall, what you have here, with such a small amount of movement, is Trump holding remarkably steady during yet-another full-throated media and political assault, the likes of which we have not seen since, you know, the last one. What\u2019s especially fascinating is that during the Russia Collusion Hoax, Democrats and their media allies were able to drive Trump\u2019s numbers down into the 30s, to as low as 37 percent back in December of 2017. This time, even with the hysteria of impeachment added to the menu, not so much. What I think this tells us is the voters are no longer jolted into dropping their support for Trump by a media that has cried wolf nearly once too often four years. In the past, the media could gin up enough hysteria to drive down Trump\u2019s approval numbers, at least until the public figured out it was all fake news. In fact, in the Rasmussen daily tracking poll, the most accurate poll of the 2016 presidential election, shows Trump\u2019s job approval rating has not only climbed from 45 to 49 percent over the last four days, his approval rating is four points higher than Barack Obama\u2019s was on this same day during his failed presidency. Obviously, these numbers can change, but we are now in the second week of Ukraine Hoax Hysteria, so as these numbers stand today, they are worthy of note. One conclusion you might make from them is that time is not on the side of the media and Democrats, is not on this side of this absurd impeachment inquiry. The plan, obviously, was to blitzkrieg the public into backing impeachment, which would force Republicans to go along with public opinion. For days and days and days we were hit 24/7 with screaming headlines and secret testimony that resulted in damaging (and selective) leaks\u2026 There is just no question the media and Democrats thought they had learned from the mistakes of the Russia coup and the plot to destroy Brett Kavanaugh: 1) Move fast, 2) hide your accuser\u2019s (the whistleblower\u2019s) true identity, and 3) do as much as possible in secrecy. Trump, though, outsmarted them by releasing the transcript of his call with the Ukrainian president, which none of his enemies expected him to do because they were sure it was a smoking gun. Well, it wasn\u2019t, but watching the media roll out their game plan as though the president had not released the transcript is more than a little amusing. I mean, now that we\u2019ve seen the transcript, stories, like this, that were obviously written two weeks ago under the assumption Trump would never give up the transcript, actually make me laugh out loud. Trump is also outsmarting the Democrats and the media by refusing to cooperate with what he correctly refers to as a kangaroo court. Good grief, this so-called whistleblower, who we already know is a registered Democrat, who we already know colluded with Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) to create the complaint, who we already know benefited by a sudden Deep State rule change to facilitate his complaint, who we already know is a crony of Joe Biden\u2019s(!!!), wants to testify in secret \u2014 which is the stuff of banana republics. This is not a legitimate inquiry, not even close. Somehow the media and Democrats came up with something that is even more of a partisan witch hunt than the Russia Hoax, and I just don\u2019t see the American people seeing something so toxically partisan and perversely secretive as legitimate. Furthermore, if Democrats actually had the goods on Trump, if the media actually had the goods on the Orange Bad Man, they wouldn\u2019t have to play all these games in secret and spread all these lies. If anything, Trump\u2019s remarkably steady approval rating show us the public is in wait-and-see mode. Democrats might be consolidating their own voters to push up the polls backing impeachment, but the public at large appears to be waiting for the evidence\u2026 And since there is none, Trump is smart to obstruct and delay, smart to treat this coup with the contempt it deserves, because the longer the public is forced to stare at this Potemkin Impeachment, the more they will see it is based on bluff, hysteria, media bias, a desire to meddle in the 2020 election, and stark-raving fear of what the upcoming Inspector General reports are going to say about the Obama administration\u2019s appalling, illegal, and unprecedented spying on Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign.

Trump said he thought Obama was \u201chiding\u201d and raised the possibility that Obama was aware of the efforts from former FBI agents Lisa Page and Peter Strzok to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. Partial transcript as follows: you know, I want to ask a question that I haven\u2019t heard you answer. And that is, where is Barack Obama in all this? Why haven\u2019t we heard from him? I mean, in the beginning of your administration, he wouldn\u2019t stop talking. And now, he\u2019s nowhere to be heard. Where is he? TRUMP: I think he\u2019s hiding. PIRRO: Why? TRUMP: I think he knows all about it. And we are talking about investigate the investigators. We\u2019re talking about the beginning. And it was really before I took office. It was \u2014 if you look at the insurance policy with Strzok and Page, just in case she should lose, we\u2019ve got an insurance policy. That\u2019s what all this stuff has been about, the insurance policy. These are bad people. These are evil people. And this was the insurance policy. The two lovers, Strzok and Page. Two beauties. (LAUGHTER) PIRRO: Well, you know \u2026 TRUMP: And it\u2019s a terrible thing, what they do to this country. Terrible. But we are winning. And we\u2019re winning big. And the American public knows it. And that\u2019s why I think they want to stay away. But they can do whatever they want. But they want to stay away. If you look at what\u2019s happening, Jeanine, if you take a look, the electricity for the Republican Party, they are so angry at what has taken place. Because, as an example, everybody knows that Schiff \u2014 we call him \u201cshifty Schiff\u201d \u2014 he made up the story. He made up my phone call. PIRRO: Right. TRUMP: And based on that phone call, this is what this whole thing is about. It\u2019s all about a phone call. And the call is perfect. I have given that call to everybody to read it. In fact, Lindsey Graham made a statement. He said, I never knew you were so nice. Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor",

      "author": "Neil Munro",
      "content": " The government buried its support for Obama\u2019s DACA work permits on page 15a of the legal brief submitted to the Supreme Court last November by Solicitor General Noel Francisco. The plea says that work permits for DACA migrants are allowed under \u201cSection 1324a\u201d of the federal law. The administration\u2019s August 19, almost final, submission to the court, echoes that claim by ignoring the issue. Some anti-DACA legal pleas are spotlighting the government\u2019s low profile support of the 1324a claim. \u201cThe Government has never said which benefits it does not believe it may lawfully confer [to DACA recipients] \u2026 Nor has the Government explained whether or to what extent it now believes the DHS work-authorization regulation is unlawful,\u201d said a legal brief from several unions. The near silence about DACA work permits shows that government lawyers are ignoring the best argument against Obama\u2019s DACA, said John Miano, a lawyer with the\u00a0Immigration Reform Law Institute. But the work permit issue hides a massive economic landmine: The government awards more than one million work permits each year using the same legal 1324a claim that Obama used in the DACA case. If the court rejects 1324a work-permit claim, investors could lose millions of migrant workers \u2014 and so face even more pressure to raise Americans\u2019 wages. \u201cClearly, the parties do not want to discuss the question of how 1324a conferred on DHS [Department of Homeland Security] unlimited power to grant alien employment,\u201d said Miano. He continued: Both the government and the [pro-DACA] plaintiffs simply claim it is exists \u2026 Few amici [pleas] supporting the [DACA migrants] raised the issue and those that did claimed 1324a created or ratified this unlimited power with no explanation.  The Obama administration took two steps during the 2012 DACA amnesty. It provided a controversial blanket get-out-0f-deportation card for 800,000 younger migrants \u2014 and it also quietly provided official, legal work permits for those migrants. The Obama administration said the blanket no deportation policy was justified by \u201cprosecutorial discretion.\u201d Obama\u2019s deputies claimed the award of work-permits for foreign migrants was legal because of an obscure corner of federal code, called Section 1324a. Obama\u2019s deputies argued that the first and last paragraphs of Section 1324a say presidents can award as many work permits as they wish: It is unlawful for a person or other\u00a0entity\u00a0to hire, or to recruit or refer for a fee, for employment in the United States an alien knowing the\u00a0alien\u00a0is an unauthorized alien\u00a0(as defined in subsection (h)(3)) \u2026 [which says] As used in this section, the term \u201cunauthorized alien\u201d means, with respect to the employment of an alien at a particular time, that the\u00a0alien\u00a0is not at that time either (A) an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence,\u00a0or (B) authorized to be so employed by this chapter or by the Attorney General. Before Obama, President George W. Bush used the same 1324a claim to justify the \u201cOptional Practical Training\u201d program. The OPT program has been used by Microsoft, Intel, Cisco, and many other companies to hire foreign graduates instead of American graduates. The administration has repeatedly refused to discuss the 1324a claim with Breitbart News. But the DACA case has forced officials to respond. In November 2018, Trump\u2019s Solicitor General wrote in a plea to the court: pre-existing DHS regulations allow all deferred-action recipients to apply for employment authorization, enabling them to work legally and pay taxes. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324a(h)(3) (empowering the Executive Branch to authorize the employment of noncitizens); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 274a.12(c)(14) (providing that \u201c[a]n alien who has been granted deferred action\u201d is eligible for work authorization upon a showing of \u201ceconomic necessity for employment\u201d). Indeed, \u201cDACA recipients are required to apply for employment authorization, in keeping with the Executive\u2019s intention that DACA recipients remain \u2018productive\u2019 members of society.\u201d The administration\u2019s August 19, 2019 plea includes this supporting claim: Under DHS regulations, aliens granted deferred action may receive certain benefits, including work authorization for the same period if they establish economic necessity, 8 C.F.R. 274a.12(c)(14). But a Texas appeals court has already struck down the 1324a work-permit claim when it blocked Obama\u2019s follow-on amnesty \u2014 the 2014 DAPA amnesty for the illegal immigrant parents of U.S.-born children. The Texas court said: For the authority to implement DAPA, the government relies in part on 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324a(h)(3), a provision that does not mention lawful presence or deferred action, and that is listed as a \u201c[m]iscellaneous\u201d definitional provision expressly limited to \u00a7 1324a, a section concerning the \u201cUnlawful employment of aliens\u201d\u2014an exceedingly unlikely place to find authorization for DAPA. If the Supreme Court upholds the Texas court\u2019s rejection of the DACA work permits, it will bar work permits for the DACA illegals and many other foreign workers, said Miano. Immigration reform groups are trying to spotlight the issue, amid media silence. For example, Miano\u2019s Immigration Law Reform Institute submitted a plea saying: if \u00a7 1324a(h)(3) permitted DHS to give work authorization to DACA beneficiaries, it could only be because that provision allowed DHS to authorize work for any class of alien it chose; the provision contains no limiting language. If Congress had granted the\u00a0executive branch such vast discretion, it would have done so clearly, not through \u201cvague terms or ancillary provisions\u2014it does not, one might say, hide elephants in mouseholes.\u201d Whitman v. Am. Trucking Ass\u2019ns, 531 U.S. 457, 468 (2001). It is not reasonable to suppose that Congress, without any clear statement that it was doing so, granted to DHS the unrestricted power to overthrow Congress\u2019s own grants of employment protection to American workers. The 1324a claim is a huge economic issue because it justifies the award of work permits to many foreign migrants, students, and graduates. For example, Bush\u2019s OPT and pre-graduation \u201cCurricular Practical Training\u201d program has ballooned to 430,000 active work permits in 2017. That army includes tens of thousands of foreign graduates who were invited to take jobs at prestigious U.S. firms \u2014 so denying those jobs to the children of the U.S. professional class. The minimal media coverage of the OPT program also helps to hide the OPT fraud, which cheats the sons and daughters of middle-class Americans.  But the OPT program is especially important to universities because it allows them to market their expensive credentials to foreign students with promises of work permit that last up to three years. In 2018,\u00a0143,000 foreign customers of U.S. post-graduate colleges received the work-permits. The OPT program is just one corner of the huge work-permit economy created by the 1324a claim. In 2018, at least 1.97 million\u00a0work permits\u00a0\u2014 mostly lasting one year\u00a0 \u2014 were issued to foreigners, according to data provided by the Department of Homeland Security. The wave of work permits was issued via a diversity of mandatory and discretionary programs, including many programs justified by the 1324a claim. The huge total provides roughly two work permit workers for every four Americans who turned 18 that year. This gusher of foreign workers has sidelined many young and old Americans, suppressed their wages and salaries, and boosted stock-market returns by preventing a bidding war for American employees in a growing economy. The 2018 work permit total includes 328,000 work permits for DACA migrants, 54,000 permits for the wives of Indian H-1B visa-workers, 245,000 work permits for resident foreigners who merely ask for green cards \u2014 dubbed \u201cAdjustment of Status\u201d \u2014\u00a0 and 345,000 permits for migrants who ask for asylum. The work permit total does not include at least 150,000 new visa-workers each year, such as the 100,000 new H-1B workers who joined the existing population of roughly 750,000 H-1B workers.  In the 2016 election, Trump denounced the H-1B visa program, which keeps roughly 800,000 foreign graduates in U.S. jobs. But Trump has also repeatedly said he welcomes the movement of foreign graduates into the U.S. economy. On October 11, for example, he told reporters: We\u2019re going to be very good to Chinese students.\u00a0 Nope.\u00a0 I\u2019ve heard this question many times before, including from our own security people.\u00a0 We want all the people that want to come over from China.\u00a0 We have the greatest university system in the world, and we\u2019re going to keep it that way.\u00a0\u00a0 And one of the reasons it\u2019s great is we have a lot of students from China.\u00a0No, we\u2019re not going to make it tough.\u00a0 We\u2019re going to make it like for everybody else.\u00a0 Okay?\u00a0 We\u2019re going to make it \u2014 I think that\u2019s important. \u2026 I want them coming here.\u00a0 We want the greatest talent in the world coming to our great universities \u2014 to Harvard, Yale, Princeton, the great Wharton School of Finance \u2014 to Stanford, all of these great schools.\u00a0 We want them \u2014 we want them coming here.\u00a0 And that\u2019s what we have.\u00a0 And that\u2019s one of the reasons we have the great system.\u00a0And there have been discussing about [stopping] that \u2014 not by me, because I ended them very quickly.\u00a0 I want to let you know, I end those discussions very quickly. Pro-DACA groups try to minimize media coverage of the legality of the 1324a claim. But some of the pro-DACA legal briefs briefly endorse the 1324a claim. The main plaintiff, the University of California, wrote: Beginning with President Eisenhower, every administration has exercised this authority to grant deferred action to groups of otherwise removable immigrants. Congress has expressly recognized that the Executive Branch possesses this authority. It did so knowing that longstanding regulations confer benefits, such as work authorization, on individuals granted deferred action. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324a(h)(3). In 2017, the University of California had more than 40,000 foreign students, and more than 10,200 OPT graduates. The top law officers in California, Maryland, Maine, and Minnesota argued for the preservation of the work-permit claim as they wrote: By regulation, the Attorney General (and now the Secretary) have exercised statutory authority to confer certain limited benefits on individuals who receive deferred action. Petitioners do not question these \u201clongstanding regulations.\u201d \u2026\u00a0 Congress confirmed the Attorney General\u2019s authority to adopt this regulation in the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, which made it unlawful for an employer to hire an \u201cunauthorized alien,\u201d defined as one who is not either a lawful permanent resident or \u201cauthorized to be so employed by [the INA] or by the Attorney General.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324a(h)(3) (emphasis added). The OPT program was created at the request of Microsoft and is widely used by many companies to hire foreign graduates instead of American graduates. In 2017, the company employed roughly 1,000 OPT graduates.\u00a0Lawyers for Microsoft Corp. wrote: the statute prohibiting employment of any \u201cunauthorized alien\u201d defines that term to exclude persons \u201cauthorized to be so employed by [the INA] or by the [DHS Secretary].\u201d 8 U.S.C. 1324a(h)(3) (emphasis added). Since 1987, the Secretary has exercised this authority to permit employers to hire numerous categories of noncitizens\u2014ranging from certain persons with pending asylum applications, to non-immigrant students who face unforeseen economic hardship. New York\u2019s top lawyers argued, \u201cCongress has both recognized the existence of deferred action and confirmed the DHS Secretary\u2019s authority to make deferred action recipients eligible for work authorization, see 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1154 (deferred action); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324a(h)(3) (work authorization).\u201d A group of 165 colleges and universities claimed \u201cwork authorization is not unique to DACA. Rather, it is a product of federal regulations that predate DACA by decades, that have been invoked by administrations of both parties since the 1970s, and that Congress has approved since 1986.\u201d The establishment media have ignored the huge 1324a work-permit issue\u00a0amid favorable coverage of DACA illegals, the \u201cH4EAD\u201d wives of H-1B workers, and the Central American migrants.  \u201cNo-one wants to talk about it,\u201d said Miano. But \u201cif you say DACA is legal, it is legal for any president to wipe out [numerical] protections for American workers in the immigration system.\u201d \u201cIt is astonishing they are defending a provision that has been most abused by the [presidential] Executives \u2026 to get around the [annual] limit on immigration that Congress has created,\u201d said Jessica Vaughan, policy director at the Center for Immigration Studies. \u201cDefending this [claimed 1324a] authority is giving the [White House] executive branch control over the number of foreign workers in our country, and that authority should rest with Congress.\u201d  Immigration Numbers: Each year, roughly four million young\u00a0Americans join the workforce after graduating from high school\u00a0or a university. This total includes about 800,000 Americans who graduate with skilled degrees in business or health care, engineering or science, software, or statistics. But the federal government then imports about 1.1 million legal immigrants and refreshes a resident population of\u00a0about 1.5 million white-collar visa workers \u2014 including approximately one million H-1B workers and spouses \u2014 and about 500,000 blue-collar visa workers.\u00a0The government also prints more than one million work permits for new foreigners and rarely punishes companies for employing illegal migrants. This policy of inflating the labor supply\u00a0boosts\u00a0economic growth and stock values for\u00a0investors. The stimulus happens because the extra labor ensures that employers do not have to compete for American workers by offering higher wages and better working conditions. The federal policy of\u00a0flooding\u00a0the market with cheap, foreign white-collar\u00a0graduates\u00a0and blue-collar\u00a0labor\u00a0shifts wealth from\u00a0young\u00a0employees toward older investors. It also\u00a0widens\u00a0wealth gaps,\u00a0reduces\u00a0high-tech investment,\u00a0increases\u00a0state and local tax burdens, reduces\u00a0marriage\u00a0rates, and hurts children\u2019s schools and\u00a0college\u00a0educations. The cheap-labor economic strategy also\u00a0pushes\u00a0Americans away from high-tech careers, and it sidelines millions of\u00a0marginalized\u00a0Americans, including many who are now\u00a0struggling\u00a0with drug addictions. The labor policy also\u00a0moves\u00a0business investment and wealth from the\u00a0Heartland\u00a0to the\u00a0coastal\u00a0cities,\u00a0explodes\u00a0rents and housing\u00a0costs, undermines suburbia,\u00a0shrivels\u00a0real estate values in the Midwest, and rewards investors for creating low-tech,\u00a0labor-intensive\u00a0workplaces. But President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cHire American\u201d policy is boosting wages by capping immigration within a growing economy. The Census Bureau\u00a0said\u00a0September 10 that men who work full-time and year-round got an average earnings boost of 3.4 percent in 2018, pushing their median salaries up to $55,291. Women gained 3.3 percent in wages, bringing their median salaries to $45,097 for full time, year-round work.  ",

That way, when they boot President\u00a0Trump\u00a0from office, they will have voters on their side. And Vice President Mike Pence won\u2019t be left sitting in the Oval Office. So, what is this all about? It is a cover-up, plain and simple. Whom, you ask, are they trying to cover for? Their next political savior who can take down\u00a0Mr. Trump? Certainly not former Vice President Joseph R. Biden. If anything, Mr. Biden has been set ablaze atop the altar as a sacrifice in this massive international cover-up by Democrats.

When was the last time you heard any major Democratic persecutor in Congress utter the word \u201cRussia\u201d? As Sherlock Holmes would say, it is the dog that DIDN\u2019T bark. Which brings us to the \u201cwhom\u201d that Democrats are sacrificing all in an effort to protect: former President Barack Obama. Currently, there are a handful of very, very serious probes by nonpartisan prosecutors bound by rules of fairness and due process looking into the origins of the Obama administration\u2019s spying operation on the campaign of a political opponent at the height of the 2016 election season. This is and always has been the most gravely serious matter in the whole fake Russia \u201ccollusion\u201d saga. People go to jail for doing things like this in America. And it\u2019s not just former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper or ex-CIA Director John Brennan and dirty FBI agents like Peter Strzok who face devastating consequences if it can be proved they used their massive government powers in an effort to destroy a political opponent. It could reach deep into the White House. It could reach the top. This is why Mrs. Pelosi has dropped Russia and collusion and stopped talking about the Mueller report or all the fantasies laid out in the \u201cdirty dossier\u201d that Democrats paid foreign agents to dig up on\u00a0Mr. Trump\u00a0from Russian sources. It is also why Mrs. Pelosi refuses to run the current impeachment \u201cinquiry\u201d with even a hint of due process or fairness. If the minority \u2014 or the executive branch \u2014 were afforded the fairness that attended past impeachments, Republicans would gain subpoena powers to call witnesses. Do you think Republicans might like to question Mr. Brennan or Mr. Clapper under oath about who authorized espionage against political opponents during the height of a presidential campaign? Of course they would. But Mrs. Pelosi will never let them get that close to Mr. Obama. So \u2026 Ukraine! Joe Biden be damned. \u2981\u00a0Contact Charles Hurt at\u00a0churt@washingtontimes.com\u00a0or on Twitter @charleshurt.",

      "subtitle": "The Obama administration dismissed warnings raised by top State Department official George Kent in 2015 that the Ukrainian company that was employing then-Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter at the time was corrupt, the Washington Post confirmed Thursday.",
      "author": "Edwin Mora",
      "content": " The Post\u2019s report suggested the Obama administration allowed Hunter Biden to continue serving on Burisma Holdings\u2019 board of directors although it knew the company was corrupt. Echoing a report from NBC News issued earlier this week, the Post noted: A career State Department official overseeing Ukraine policy told congressional investigators this week that he had raised concerns in early 2015 about then-Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son serving on the board of a Ukrainian energy company but was turned away by a Biden staffer, according to three people familiar with the testimony. George Kent, a deputy assistant secretary of state, testified Tuesday that he worried that Hunter Biden\u2019s position at the firm Burisma Holdings would complicate efforts by U.S. diplomats to convey to Ukrainian officials the importance of avoiding conflicts of interest, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of confidentiality rules surrounding the deposition. Kent said he had concerns that Ukrainian officials would view Hunter Biden as a conduit for currying influence with his father, said the people. But when Kent raised the issue with Biden\u2019s office, he was told the then-vice president didn\u2019t have the \u201cbandwidth\u201d to deal with the issue involving his son as his other son, Beau, was battling cancer, said the people familiar with his testimony. \u2026 The Washington Post has previously reported that there had been discussions among Biden\u2019s advisers about whether his son\u2019s Ukraine work would be perceived as a conflict of interest, and that one former adviser had been concerned enough to mention it to Biden, though the conversation was brief. Kent\u2019s comments came during his closed-door deposition in the House Democrats\u2019 impeachment probe on Tuesday. When Kent raised his concerns about Burisma, the Obama administration had already cleared Hunter to serve on the company\u2019s board of directors. Hunter joined Burisma\u2019s board of directors in 2014. The former vice president was leading U.S. efforts to crack down on corruption at the time. The State official explicitly warned the Obama administration that Burisma was \u201ccorrupt,\u201d NBC News revealed near the end of its article on Kent\u2019s testimony, noting: During his nearly 10 hours of testimony, Kent also told members of Congress and their staff that Burisma, the energy company where Hunter Biden was a board member, was corrupt, according to a separate person who was present in the room. Kent said he told the Obama administration in 2016 that they should not hold an event with Burisma because of the company\u2019s extensive corruption in Ukraine. In the July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that triggered the impeachment probe, Trump urged his counterpart to investigate corruption allegations against Biden and his son Hunter. As vice president, Biden threatened to withhold aid to Ukraine to force the Eastern European country to fire its top prosecutor in 2016, who had investigated the owner of Burisma, Mykola Zlochevsky, for possible corruption. Hunter had been serving on the board of Burisma for up to $83,000 per month at the time despite having no background in energy, prompting allegations of corruption. He admitted to ABC News last weekend that his father\u2019s political position helped him secure the lucrative appointment to Burisma\u2019s board of directors. A \u201cwhistleblower\u201d allegation that during the July 25 call Trump attempted to pressure Ukraine into investigating the Bidens by withholding aid triggered the impeachment probe. Trump and Ukraine have denied the allegations. The Democrats\u2019 impeachment probe is primarily seeking to determine whether Trump withheld aid to Ukraine in a bid to get dirt on White House hopeful Biden. Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), the leader of the probe, has said, however, that there does not need to be a quid pro quo to impeach Trump.",

We need to build this movement from the ground up \u2013 right now.\u201d Before leaving the White House, Obama\u00a0stated that he would make redistricting efforts a top priority in his post-White House career. \u201cRestoring fairness to our democracy by advocating for fairer, more inclusive district maps around the country is a priority for President Obama,\u201d Obama spokesman Kevin Lewis said in a statement at the time.",

      "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
      "content": "  Trump\u2019s full statement emphasized the need to put country ahead of party as the nation celebrated, as follows: I want to personally congratulate President Obama and the men [and] women of the Armed Forces for a job very well done. I am so proud to see Americans standing shoulder to shoulder, waving the American flag in celebration of this great victory. We should spend the next several days not debating party politics, but in remembrance of those who lost their lives on 9/11 and those fighting for our freedom. God Bless America. Moreover, Trump congratulated Obama even though the president had infamously mocked him mercilessly just hours before the raid, at the 2011 White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner (WHCD). Obama said\u00a0on that occasion: And I know just the guy to do it -\u2013 Donald Trump is here tonight!\u00a0 (Laughter and applause.)\u00a0 Now, I know that he\u2019s taken some flak lately, but no one is happier, no one is prouder to put this birth certificate matter to rest than the Donald.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 And that\u2019s because he can finally get back to focusing on the issues that matter \u2013- like, did we fake the moon landing?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 What really happened in Roswell?\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 And where are Biggie and Tupac?\u00a0 (Laughter and applause.) But all kidding aside, obviously, we all know about your credentials and breadth of experience.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 For example \u2014 no, seriously, just recently, in an episode of Celebrity Apprentice \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 at the steakhouse, the men\u2019s cooking team cooking did not impress the judges from Omaha Steaks.\u00a0 And there was a lot of blame to go around.\u00a0 But you, Mr. Trump, recognized that the real problem was a lack of leadership.\u00a0 And so ultimately, you didn\u2019t blame Lil\u2019 Jon or Meatloaf.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 You fired Gary Busey.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 And these are the kind of decisions that would keep me up at night.\u00a0 (Laughter and applause.)\u00a0 Well handled, sir.\u00a0 (Laughter.)\u00a0 Well handled. Say what you will about Mr. Trump, he certainly would bring some change to the White House.\u00a0 Let\u2019s see what we\u2019ve got up there.\u00a0 (Laughter.) (Screens show \u201cTrump White House Resort and Casino.\u201d) Other Republicans were generous to Obama, too, putting patriotism ahead of politics. As the\u00a0New York Times noted: WASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama drew praise from unlikely quarters on Monday for pursuing a risky and clandestine mission to kill Osama bin Laden, a successful operation that interrupted the withering Republican criticism about his foreign policy, world view and his grasp of the office. Former Vice President Dick Cheney declared, \u201cThe administration clearly deserves credit for the success of the operation.\u201d New York\u2019s former mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, said, \u201cI admire the courage of the president.\u201d And Donald J. Trump declared, \u201cI want to personally congratulate President Obama.\u201d The\u00a0Times observed that Republicans praised Obama even though it was clear the raid would help him politically. Later in 2011 and 2012, Trump walked back his praise for Obama somewhat:   As of Sunday morning, former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), and former HUD Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro had congratulated U.S. forces while pointedly excluding President Trump from their congratulations. Joel B.

      "author": "John Hayward",
      "content": " The Muellers, who have long been critical of how the Obama administration handled Kayla\u2019s captivity from 2013 to 2015, praised Trump for being more \u201cdecisive\u201d than former President Barack Obama. \u201cWhat this man did to Kayla \u2013 he kidnapped her,\u201d an emotional Carl Mueller told the Arizona Republic. \u201cShe was held in many prisons. She was held in solitary confinement.\u201d \u201cShe was tortured. She was intimidated. She was ultimately raped by al-Baghdadi himself. He either killed her or he was complicit in her murder,\u201d Carl said, stressing a point somehow overlooked by certain media organizations. \u201cI\u2019ll let people who read this article make up their own mind how a parent should feel,\u201d Carl concluded. His wife Marsha lamented that not all of the details of Kayla\u2019s death have been revealed, including the precise circumstances of her death. The Islamic State claimed she was killed when Jordanian airstrikes on the ISIS \u201ccapital\u201d of Raqqa collapsed the building she was held prisoner in, but the Jordanians and U.S. military officials disputed that account, and few would be willing to absolve ISIS and Baghdadi of full responsibility for Kayla\u2019s death even if it was true. \u201cI still want to know, \u2018Where is Kayla?\u2019 and what truly happened to her and what aren\u2019t we being told. Someone knows, and I\u2019m praying with all my heart that someone in this world will bring us those answers,\u201d Marsha Mueller said. \u201cWe are so grateful for them,\u201d she said of the American troops who carried out the Baghdadi raid and President Trump for giving the order. The Muellers expressed gratitude that no American soldiers were killed in the operation. \u201cI still say Kayla should be here, and if Obama had been as decisive as President Trump, maybe she would have been,\u201d Marsha added. \u201cHe knows her story. He\u2019s been briefed on it, and he knows, and that\u2019s important to me. I don\u2019t think anything would have stopped him from getting this guy,\u201d Carl said of Trump, expressing confidence that the U.S. military is \u201cgoing to get them all.\u201d The Muellers were optimistic that the Trump administration would discover and reveal more details of Kayla\u2019s captivity and murder. \u201cI think this administration truly might help us. I don\u2019t think they are as closed about what happened,\u201d said Marsha. The Muellers expressed similar sentiments in other interviews on Sunday and Monday. Carl Mueller told the local CBS News affiliate on Monday it was a \u201cshock\u201d to learn of Baghdadi\u2019s confirmed death at last after years of false reports about the elusive ISIS leader\u2019s fate. \u201cOne minute you\u2019re sitting here watching a movie, and the next minute you get the news the man that raped and possibly murdered your daughter has been killed,\u201d he said. Marsha noted to CBS that Kayla\u2019s remains have never been recovered, so she cannot help nursing the faintest hope that her daughter might still be alive and lost in Syria. In any event, she said the Mueller family hopes to bring Kayla home. \u201cBecause of that one percent possibility, how do you completely give up until you have her home? We want Kayla home, and I know that sounds like an impossible task, but after what we\u2019ve been through, the things that pop up and happen I believe we might just find her,\u201d she said. \u201cWe feel this is the moment,\u201d Carl said. \u201c[Baghdadi\u2019s] been killed, some of his lieutenants have been captured, and who else would know what happened to Kayla but these people close to him? Somebody, and it may be one of these people who were captured yesterday, knows what happened and know who killed her.\u201d Marsha Mueller told CNN on Sunday she and her husband were \u201cdeeply touched\u201d by President Trump\u2019s statement on Sunday, which mentioned Kayla Mueller by name. \u201cWe were grateful that they didn\u2019t mess around and went right in,\u201d she said. \u201cI just want to say how grateful we are to this administration, to the military, and to the special forces that went in. My hope is that this will help us get answers to what really happened to Kayla and get her home,\u201d she said. Carl told ABC News on Sunday it was \u201cvery touching\u201d to learn the operation that took Baghdadi down was named after Kayla. \u201cPresident Trump mentioned her today in his statement and he mentioned that he deserved what he got for what he did to Kayla,\u201d Carl said. \u201cShe\u2019s not forgotten, and that\u2019s important.\u201d The Muellers revealed during the ABC interview they once traveled to Iraq and met with Umm Sayyaf, the imprisoned wife of Islamic State financier Abu Sayyaf, killed by U.S. special forces in 2015. \u201cWhen we talked to Umm Sayyaf, we found we got more information out of her, not just us, the people backing us \u2013 they got information from her that neither the Kurds or the US government had got in the two days that we were there,\u201d Carl said of the trip to Iraq. \u201cWe learned from women that were ransomed out by their governments that she said she was held in many cold, dark places, she was raped by al-Baghdadi, we know that to be a fact. She was murdered by him or someone in his organization. That\u2019s what we\u2019re pursuing and that\u2019s what we hope that President Trump will help us with,\u201d he said.",

SUSAN RICE: Obviously, it\u2019s a major milestone and it\u2019s one we all should be welcoming quite plainly, but it doesn\u2019t mean that the fight against ISIS is over. And it doesn\u2019t mean that we can declare mission accomplished and just walk away. What we\u2019ve seen time and time again in this part of the world is that when the pressure is relieved on terrorist organizations, whether al-Qaeda\u00a0or ISIS, they are able to reconstitute. So we need to be vigilant. We need to maintain a minimal presence in order to ensure that the pressure stays on ISIS and they don\u2019t come back roaring. MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0Was President Obama informed of the death of al-Baghdadi by the administration? Did you know before the news today? RICE: No, there\u2019s no reason why I should know. There is a tradition of common courtesy of presidents informing their predecessors of things of significance like this. Since the White House seemingly didn\u2019t feel it necessary to inform the leadership of the intelligence committees on a bipartisan basis, I\u2019m quite confident that they didn\u2019t do the normal protocol with respect to predecessors either.",

      "subtitle": "(AP) \u2014 When President Barack Obama was reelected in 2012, a Saudi tycoon and his business associate sent hundreds of thousands of dollars to the U.S. to help pay for the inaugural celebration and get a picture with the president, according to court documents and an analysis of campaign finance records by The Associated Press.",
      "author": "Breitbart News",
      "content": " U.S. election law prohibits foreign nationals from making those sorts of political contributions. But the donations Sheikh Mohammed Al Rahbani tried to send to Obama\u2019s inaugural committee were funneled through a seasoned straw donor, the records and the AP analysis show. That intermediary, Imaad Zuberi, agreed this month to plead guilty to making illegal campaign contributions to several American political candidates on behalf of foreign nationals. He is also set to plead guilty to concealing his work as a foreign agent as he lobbied high-level U.S. government officials. The prosecution by the U.S. attorney in Los Angeles is the latest in a string of cases that highlight the prevalence of banned foreign money in American politics and the often lax approach campaigns take in vetting contributions. Zuberi, a jet-setting fundraiser and venture capitalist, has raised millions of dollars for Democrats and Republicans alike over the years. Prosecutors say he has worked on behalf of several foreigners, not just Rahbani. He served as a top fundraiser for both Obama and Hillary Clinton during their presidential runs, including stints on both of their campaign finance committees, before switching his support to President Donald Trump immediately after his 2016 victory, pumping nearly $1 million into the Republican\u2019s inaugural committee. Federal Election Commission records show hundreds of donations from Zuberi and his family to Republican and Democratic national committees, the presidential campaigns of Trump and Clinton, and dozens of congressional candidates across the political spectrum. Zuberi-linked donations often went to lawmakers who are influential or outspoken on foreign policy issues, like Sen. Lindsey Graham and Democratic Rep. Eliot Engel, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Only Zuberi has been charged in the case, and prosecutors have not alleged that any campaign that received money from him was aware that at least some of his donations were financed by foreigners. Zuberi\u2019s case raises questions about the degree to which political committees vet donors. One campaign, not identified by name, accepted donations made in the name of one of Zuberi\u2019s dead relatives, prosecutors said. Another political committee took donations from a person Zuberi invented. Some donations reported by political campaigns were made in Rahbani\u2019s and others\u2019 names but were paid for with credit cards belonging to Zuberi or his wife, prosecutors said. Requests for comment were sent to representatives for Graham, Clinton and Engel. Steve Kerrigan, CEO of Obama\u2019s 2013 inauguration committee, said it had a very thorough vetting process that included requiring donors to certify that their contributions complied with the law. He declined to comment further on the specifics of Zuberi\u2019s donations. As a middleman, Zuberi was deeply flawed. Zuberi, 49, admitted in a plea agreement that only $97,500 of the $850,000 that he was supposed to deliver to the Obama inaugural committee on Rahbani\u2019s behalf actually made it into the committee\u2019s hands. The rest, he skimmed for himself. Rahbani declined to comment through an assistant. Zuberi\u2019s attorneys and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Los Angeles all declined to comment. The case shares similarities with others recently filed against people accused of channeling banned foreign donations to U.S. candidates. Two associates of Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, pleaded not guilty Wednesday to federal charges they used foreign money to make unlawful campaign contributions to several U.S. candidates and committees. Prosecutors said the donations orchestrated by Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman included a $325,000 contribution to a group supporting Trump\u2019s reelection, made at a time when the pair were lobbying U.S. politicians to oust the country\u2019s ambassador to Ukraine. In April, a Washington political consultant was sentenced to three years of probation after admitting he made a $50,000 straw donation on behalf of a wealthy Ukrainian client who wanted tickets to Trump\u2019s inauguration. Like Zuberi, W. Samuel Patten also was charged with to failing to register as a foreign lobbyist. The FEC earlier this year fined a super PAC that supported Jeb Bush\u2019s failed 2016 Republican presidential bid for accepting $1.3 million in illegal donations from Chinese nationals. Zuberi has also been under scrutiny by federal prosecutors in New York after he donated $900,000 to Trump\u2019s inaugural committee and $100,000 to a Republican campaign committee. Those donations occurred around the time Zuberi accompanied Qatar\u2019s foreign minister to a meeting at Trump Tower. Trump\u2019s inaugural committee has not been accused of wrongdoing in connection with the money it received from Zuberi. It says it has cooperated with the federal inquiry. Rahbani is named in the charging documents in Zuberi\u2019s case only as \u201cPerson A,\u201d but the AP was able to identify him through biographical details in the court filing and by matching the timing and amounts of donations mentioned in the court filing to publicly available campaign finance records. For instance, prosecutors in court filings said \u201cPerson A\u201d and his wife made four donations of $2,700 to \u201cCampaign J\u201d on Sept. 28, 2016, while one of Rahbani\u2019s business associates donated $400 to the same campaign on that date. FEC records indicate that Rahbani, his wife, Kate Rahbani, and one of Rahbani\u2019s business associates made donations in those amounts on that date to Graham\u2019s Senate campaign. Those donations, unlike others in the case, were listed in the FEC records with the Rahbanis\u2019 names and address in London. Graham\u2019s campaign returned some of those donations in 2017, and when doing so listed them as going to Zuberi\u2019s address, FEC records show. Those are just a few of several donations mentioned by prosecutors that the AP was able to match with public campaign records that listed Rahbani and people associated as the donors. Prosecutors also described Person A as having dual citizenship in Saudi Arabia and the United Kingdom, a residence in Switzerland and an American wife. In media profiles, Rahbani has talked about owning homes in London and Switzerland. His wife is an American. The criminal case against Zuberi doesn\u2019t explain why Rahbani would have wanted to contribute to American political campaigns. His company SAFID \u2014 a manufacturer of air conditioning-related products \u2014 is active throughout the Middle East and says on its website that it has worked on projects financed by the Saudi government. Rahbani, in a few past interviews, has talked about his support of Obama. He posted pictures on his website of himself and his wife standing with Obama, former Vice President Joe Biden and their spouses at a 2013 inaugural event. The website was taken down shortly after Zuberi\u2019s plea was made public. Prosecutors said $100,000 from Rahbani\u2019s company meant for the inaugural committee was earmarked for \u201cphotos.\u201d It isn\u2019t unusual for political fundraisers to offer photo sessions with candidates in exchange for donations and such practices are legal \u2014 although the ban on donations from foreign nationals would apply. Zuberi, however, tried to get Rahbani and one of his business associates to donate even more money by falsely claiming they had taken too many people to a photo session with Obama and Biden and owed more money as a result, prosecutors said. \u201cI\u2019m deeply concerned about foreigners trying to intervene in our elections, and I don\u2019t think we\u2019re doing enough to try to stop it,\u201d FEC chairwoman Ellen Weintraub told the AP. \u201cThey don\u2019t get a say in who we elect \u2014 or at least they\u2019re not supposed to.\u201d ___ Suderman reported from Richmond, Virginia.

The world is messy. There are ambiguities. People who do really good stuff have flaws,\u201d Obama said. The failed president singled out the following as a \u201cdanger\u201d for young people\u2026 \u201cAnd I think one danger I see among young people, particularly on college campuses \u2026 and this is accelerated by social media,\u201d he explained, \u201cis this sense sometimes of, \u2018The way of me making change is to be as judgmental as possible about other people, and that\u2019s enough.'\u201d Obama used the example of someone using the wrong \u201cverb,\u201d although he probably meant pronoun, meaning how people are being destroyed for referring to a biological male who thinks he\u2019s a woman as a \u201che.\u201d \u201cLike, if I tweet or hashtag about how you didn\u2019t do something right, or used the wrong verb \u2026 then I can sit back and feel pretty good about myself. \u2018Cause man, you see how woke I was? I called you out.'\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s not activism,\u201d Obama added. \u201cThat\u2019s not bringing about change. If all you\u2019re doing is casting stones, you\u2019re probably not going to get that far.\u201d Before we put a MAGA hat on President Bitter Clinger, what\u2019s important to keep in mind is that if the Fascist Woketard Movement was effective at furthering the left\u2019s agenda, does anyone doubt Obama would be all for it? Listen, this guy lost a brutal re-election campaign in 2016. No, he wasn\u2019t on the ballot, but make no mistake, he was out there next to Hillary promising America a third Obama term, and lost to a man he personally despises, a man who promised to reverse Obama\u2019s entire legacy. Everything Obama spent eight years building, including ISIS *teehee,* Trump has either completely or nearly unraveled or considerably weakened, from the Iran Deal to the Paris Accords to the Obamacare mandate. Unlike his vice president, though, Obama is no dummy. He might not like everyday Americans, but he is not out of touch, and he proved that by winning two national elections by pretty safe margins. In other words, Obama understands that one of the primary reasons Trump won was due to a backlash against increasingly stifling political correctness, which has only gotten worse while Trump has been in office. Obama knows how unattractive this movement is, how it turns off most Americans, and that it plays into the hands of the political right. To Obama\u2019s credit, though, his argument against these puritan fascists is a good one, a moral one, especially what he says at first about how their demand for purity denies the fact that good people can have honest differences, that different ideas about the world, and that ambiguities over absolutes, even flaws, do not equal PURGE THE WITCH!!! Woke is what happens when a large part of our culture rejects the Judeo-Christian ideals of tolerance, a path to redemption, and forgiveness, and instead embraces a secular religion that demands rigid conformity, celebrates intolerance of dissent, and punishes individualism and intellectual diversity.

Martha\u2019s Vineyard is whiter than my subdivision here in rural North Carolina. Martha\u2019s Vineyard is whiter than MSNBC. During a Tuesday appearance at the Obama Foundation Summit in Chicago, she said, \u201cBut unbeknownst to us, we grew up in the period \u2014 as I write \u2014 called \u2018white flight.\u2019 That as families like ours, upstanding families like ours \u2026 As we moved in, white folks moved out because they were afraid of what our families represented.\u201d \u201cAnd I always stop there when I talk about this out in the world because, you know, I want to remind white folks that y\u2019all were running from us.\u201d She went on, \u201cThis family with all the values that you\u2019ve read about. You were running from us. And you\u2019re still running, because we\u2019re no different than the immigrant families that are moving in \u2026 the families that are coming from other places to try to do better.\u201d Did I mention that Michelle and Barry just purchased a $15 million estate in Martha\u2019s Vineyard, which is 95 percent white? Oh, and did I mention the Obamas own a second home, an $8 million mansion, in the exclusive DC neighborhood of Kalorama, which is 80 percent white and just four percent black. Oh, and did I mention the Obamas have a third home, a $5.3 million mansion, in Rancho Mirage, California, which is 89 percent white and just 2.6 percent black. Oh, sure, the Obamas still own their Chicago home in Hyde Park, which is at least 26 percent black. But you would think they could do better than 26 percent! I like Michelle Obama. I have always liked Michelle Obama. I\u2019ve never said an unkind word about her, quite the opposite, and while I find her politics ignorant, she was a terrific first lady. But this is nuts\u2026 Not only is she attacking white people for seeking a better standard of living, which I can assure you (as I will explain below) has little to do with racism, she is also attacking whites after she herself \u201cfled\u201d to 95 percent white Martha\u2019s Vineyard (I will never stop repeating this point) and two other homes in areas where the black population is less than 5 percent. Worse still, she is putting white people in a position where they can never win, where they are damned if they do or don\u2019t, where they are always and forever racist. If white people move out of a black neighborhood, they\u2019re racists engaging in white flight. But\u2026 And this is important\u2026 If white people move into a minority neighborhood, they are also racists for either engaging in gentrification \u2014 which is just another form of cultural genocide, donchaknow \u2014 or cultural appropriation. Now I\u2019m going to tell you a little something about white flight, from my own \u00a0experience\u2026 Because I was poor, back in the mid-eighties, I lived in the inner-city of Milwaukee for two years. My wife and I did not flee (my wife is not white, by the way) because of \u201cicky minorities\u201d (did I mention my wife is not white?), we fled because it was not safe to live there. It was never safe. Over those two years, we had been mugged, robbed, and had our car stolen. That\u2019s why we left. And when we fled, it was to a community that was still not as white as *ahem* Martha\u2019s Vineyard. In 2002, my wife and I moved to California for nine years and lived in an East Los Angeles neighborhood that was just four percent white. For nearly a decade, I was outnumbered 96-4 and never gave it a thought because I was not outnumbered. A darker skin tone, an accent, and different religious traditions did not make my neighbors any less American than me, and when I am among Americans I am among my own. We left because predominantly white leftists are destroying California. Then there\u2019s my poor dad\u2026 He moved to the Northside of Milwaukee in 1980, and spent decades, a lot of money, and a ton of sweat, remodeling his home, building a garage, and paying that home off. He intended to retire there. And yes, there were black people in his neighborhood when he moved in, and for most of his adult life he worked in predominantly black institutions. He never intended to move, and held on for as long as he could\u2026 He didn\u2019t flee because of black people. He was not forced to start all over at age 67 because he suddenly decided he didn\u2019t like blacks. He left because he was robbed, because gangs started tagging his house and garage, because it was no longer safe to live there. You know\u2026 If we\u2019re going to shame people for such things, what does it say to black people when other black people, especially the first black president and his family, reject them? What the hell kind of message is this to send to black Americans, especially when the Obamas can afford the security to live safely in any neighborhood they choose? And if the Obamas wanted to live in Southern California, why choose Rancho Mirage over Ladera Heights, the Black Beverly Hills, a predominantly black neighborhood as swank as any in America? Shame on Michelle and Barack Obama. They have the money and profile to make an important statement on this issue, but they obviously prefer to live in overwhelmingly white neighborhoods.

The State Department reportedly agreed on Wednesday to provide the information to American Oversight by November 22. American Oversight filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) to get the documents. Cooper\u2019s October 23 ruling came amid the House Democrats\u2019 partisan impeachment inquiry. Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine are at the center of the investigation. It appears that American Oversight is helping its Democrat allies with their efforts to impeach and remove Trump. So far, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has refused to produce documents sought by House Democrat impeachment investigators. On Wednesday, McClatchy reported: According to a brief filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on Wednesday night, the State Department settled on terms for the records release with American Oversight, an ethics watchdog that sued for a swift release of the records in court. The records will also include communications from Pompeo\u2019s inner circle with [President Donald Trump\u2019s private lawyer Rudy] Giuliani or with any other individuals outside of government related to Giuliani\u2019s Ukraine efforts. \u2026 According to its joint filing with American Oversight updating the court, the State Department agreed to release communications \u2013 including text messages, e-mails, and electronic calendar entries \u2013 \u201cwith the appropriate redactions\u201d regarding the president\u2019s efforts to pressure the Ukrainian government to investigate the family of former Vice President Joe Biden.

Wednesday\u2019s brief came in response to Judge Cooper\u2019s October 23 request for a status update. Pompeo has vowed to fulfill his department\u2019s legal obligations in the impeachment probe but has refused to release documents requested by investigators. The secretary has said the State Department would take a cue from the White House, which is refusing to cooperate with House Democrats pursuing the impeachment inquiry. Last week, Pompeo declared that he saw \u201cno reason\u201d for State to refuse abiding by the October 23 ruling.",

They obeyed all the rules. They weren\u2019t money-grubbers, public service from the beginning of his career. He didn\u2019t go into private money. He went into helping the country with community development, the whole works, public service. And it drives some people who don\u2019t like the success of anybody that was a minority crazy. You suggested that was one of the reasons why you thought Trump might win.\u201d Rice said, \u201cI think it was that and more. I think there was a vein of discontent that I sensed that Trump had the potential to tap into. Part of it may have been, of course, the fact that we had an African-American president who was elected twice and quite successful in office. But I think it was broader than that. And, you know, at that time the field was very large, and it seemed almost inconceivable to most people that it wouldn\u2019t be, you know, a Bush or a Rubio or something like that. But Trump had a particular brand of tapping into visceral, negative views of, you know, many Americans.\u201d Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN",

      "author": "Michael Patrick Leahy",
      "content": " It was a warmup for the evening\u2019s Democrat Party Liberty and Justice Celebration and fundraiser at the Wells Fargo Arena, where thousands of rank-and-file Democrats are expected to listen to 14 of the candidates vying for the 2020 Democrat presidential nomination explain why Iowa Caucus attendees should back them. Breitbart News spoke with two of the Buttigieg volunteers, one from Santa Barbara and another from San Diego, who said they were part of 150 volunteers who paid their own way to come to Iowa to support the Buttigieg campaign. One volunteer said that a total of 1,200 Buttigieg volunteers from around the country flew to Des Moines to lend their support to Buttigieg. \u201cI\u2019m strictly a volunteer. I absolutely paid for my travel here myself,\u201d Laurie from Santa Barbara told Breitbart News. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be at least 150 to 200 people from California for Pete tonight,\u201d she added. Laurie had a succinct explanation for why she made the trip to Des Moines. \u201cThis is a big deal for the Democratic Party to be participating in this event. As we all know, this is the event tonight that turned around the polls and the momentum for Barack Obama. And we see the same thing happening for Pete,\u201d she said. Laurie was also optimistic about Buttigieg\u2019s chances of winning the Iowa Caucuses outright, saying, \u201cIf you look at the polls released this morning from CNN it basically shows a four-way tie for first place.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re here as part of the barnstorming effort for Pete. It\u2019s a group of volunteers who feel so inspired by Pete running for president that we paid our own way to fly to Iowa to meet with the folks here and get visibility for Pete and explain our personal stories as to why we feel Pete is the most qualified person to be president,\u201d George, who said he is a deputy city clerk from San Diego, told Breitbart News. \u201cI feel like Pete speaks to the division in the country, and why we need to have a candidate to bring everyone together. He speaks about the day after the election how divided the country will be, regardless of who the next president is, and how important it will be to everyone in the country to feel that the person that\u2019s been elected speaks to them. So he\u2019s staking out a ground that speaks to, not either side, but to both sides of the country,\u201d George added. When pressed by Breitbart News to explain how Buttigieg\u2019s support for the ongoing impeachment inquiry of President Trump by Democrats in the House of Representatives\u2014which many Republicans have characterized as a grossly unfair and un-American partisan witch hunt\u2014would unite the country, George was unable to provide a compelling response. \u201cEach of these individual candidates has a position as to whether the president has committed a high crime or misdemeanor. That\u2019s the position they\u2019re taking. I feel that, for a lot of folks, an inquisition, or an inquiry is important for everybody to look into,\u201d George said Breitbart News spoke with two Buttigieg volunteers from Indiana at another venue in Des Moines on Friday morning who confirmed that volunteers have flown in to Des Moines from around the country at their own expense, but could not confirm the number of such volunteers. As many as 200,000 Iowa Democrats are expected to gather across the state on February 3 for a first-in-the-nation electoral contest to determine the party\u2019s presidential nominee for the November 2020 general election. Blue and yellow \u201cPete 2020\u201d campaign signs are widely visible in downtown Des Moines, a clear indication that the presidential campaign of the 37-year-old two-term mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is well organized on the ground in advance of the evening\u2019s event. Other campaigns, including those of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), former Vice President Joe Biden (D), and Andrew Yang (D), also had street signage visible in Des Moines on Friday, but most of that was within a thousand feet of the Wells Fargo Arena. In advance of the evening, all the major presidential campaigns hosted meet and greet events near the Wells Fargo Arena on Friday afternoon in hopes of creating volunteer enthusiasm and support for their candidate at the evening\u2019s event. The Buttigieg campaign is clearly hoping that the candidate\u2019s speech this evening\u2013where each candidate is limited to a ten minute address\u2013will give him the same kind of boost that Obama received when he addressed the same event 11 years earlier in 2007.",

      "author": "Penny Starr",
      "content": " McCarthy said in the release: I take the helm determined to see that NRDC brings our country, and our world, together in the fight for a future that is healthier, more sustainable and equitable. For 50 years NRDC has stood up for the protection of our environment and the health of people. \u201cThe climate crisis is the central challenge of our time,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cThe stakes have never been higher, and NRDC has never been stronger.\u201d \u201cNRDC was built for this moment,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cIt was built for this mission.\u201d \u201cI am excited to work to expand NRDC\u2019s reach and strengthen our capacity to drive needed change,\u201d McCarthy said. NRDC praised McCarthy\u2019s work as head of EPA under Barack Obama, including her help on the Paris Climate Accord. The announcement of her hiring comes on the same day that President Donald Trump announced the official departure \u00a0of the U.S. from the climate agreement: In her role as U.S. EPA Administrator, McCarthy oversaw some of the most consequential work in the agency\u2019s history, including strengthening safeguards for clean water and air, setting the first-ever limits on carbon pollution from power plants and advancing the U.S. environmental diplomacy that helped produce the landmark 2015 Paris climate agreement. The announcement does not mention McCarthy\u2019s role in the disastrous toxic spill into Colorado\u2019s Animas River, which Breitbart News reported on in August 2015: The same environmental groups who called for severe penalties against companies and industry executives responsible for similar environmental catastrophes are singing a different tune now that the EPA has caused a toxic waste blowout into Colorado\u2019s Animas River. A spokesperson for the NRDC elaborated on the organization\u2019s views in an interview with Breitbart News. \u201cEPA Administrator Gina McCarthy said on Tuesday everyone at EPA was very sorry for the spill and would work to make sure this tragedy never happens again,\u201d NRDC spokesperson and director of strategic engagement Bob Deans tells Breitbart News. Deans says NRDC thinks the EPA should be \u201cheld accountable\u201d for the spill, but was unable to say what \u201cholding them accountable\u201d actually means. He declined to call for the firing of any EPA executives, when asked specifically whether EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy or EPA Region 8 Administrator Sean McGrath should be fired. \u201cWe want to withhold comment until all the facts are in. You know, when the BP oil rig blew out in the Gulf Coast a few years ago, it took months to find out what happened.\u201d \u201cMcCarthy will be taking the helm of NRDC at the most critical time in the environmental movement\u2019s history,\u201d the press release said. \u201cShe will support NRDC\u2019s work to defend bedrock natural resources and public health protections, while advancing vital solutions to our climate crisis across the world.\u201d Follow Penny Starr on Twitter",

      "subtitle": "Finally, we may have solved the mystery of how former President Obama managed to drag the U.S. into the Paris Climate Accord \u2013 effectively a form of binding international treaty \u2013 without the necessary Congressional ratification.",
      "author": "James Delingpole",
      "content": " According to a lawsuit filed Monday, the Obama administration fudged the issue by misrepresenting U.S. Senate instructions set forth in 1992 to pretend that what was a treaty somehow wasn\u2019t a treaty. The implication is that the Obama administration lied in order to railroad through a policy that it feared might get vetoed by Congress. The case, brought by the public interest law firm Government Accountability & Oversight, centres on an Obama-era State Department Circular 175 memo. The suit, on behalf of the nonprofit group Energy Policy Advocates (EPA), seeks records requested in June 2019, including the memorandum setting forth State\u2019s \u201cworking law\u201d claiming that the U.S. could enter Paris \u2013 what the Obama White House called \u201cthe most ambitious climate agreement in history\u201d \u2013 without obtaining Senate approval required of treaties. The complaint notes that EPA has come into possession of a document purporting to be theObama State Department\u2019s \u201cCircular 175\u201d memo, a required legal justification which State has been improperly hiding from the public. GAO\u2019s Chris Horner, co-author of a 2017 paper \u201cTheLegal and Economic Case Against the Paris Treaty\u201d, notes that: If this document EPA has obtained is in fact the actual Circular 175 memo, it represents a major political and legal scandal with significant implications for U.S. participation in Paris, and the effort to bind the U.S. without following the Constitution. This memo demonstrates the Obama administration\u2019s unlawful entry into the Paris treaty. Under the\u00a0Constitution\u2019s Article II, Section 2, no president can commit the U.S. to treaties without Senate advice and consent. But on the previous occasion the U.S. was offered the chance to enter an international climate agreement under these Senate ground rules \u2013 the 1997 Kyoto Protocol \u2013 the Senate did not ratify it. The Obama administration was anxious to avoid the Paris Climate Accord meeting the same rejection \u2013 and so sought ways to disguise the fact that what was billed as\u00a0\u201cthe most ambitious climate change agreement in history\u201d was also a treaty. It did this, Government Accountability & Oversight\u2019s Chris Horner argues, by sleight of hand: This 18-page memo bases its argument that Paris need not face Article II, Section 2 \u201cadvice and consent\u201d in key part on a gross and material misrepresentation of the history of prior climate agreements supposedly authorizing Pres. Obama\u2019s unilateral \u201cratification\u201d of Paris. The memo falsely asserts that the U.S. Senate, in ratifying the UN Framework Convention in 1992, limited agreements that \u201cwould need to be submitted to the Senate for advise and consent (Exec. Rept. 102-55, p. 14)\u201d to those that claim to have \u201clegally binding targets and timetables\u201d. This is demonstrably false, and likely related to the secrecy with which State has treated this document. Damningly, on this one point the advocacy-heavy \u201cMemorandum of Law\u201d curiously avoids quoting the cited page 14 of Exec. Rept. 102-55, \u201cReport to Accompany Treaty Doc. 102-38\u201d, which in fact says something very different. There the Senate clearly set forth two, distinct hypothetical agreements requiring Senate approval, one of which is any decision \u201cto adopt targets and timetables\u201d \u2013 not just those purporting to be \u201clegally binding\u201d (e.g., Kyoto, Paris).[1] The mystery since 2015 of how the Obama administration skirted this reality is now solved: the memo legally justifying U.S. participation in the Paris Agreement without Senate approval misrepresents the U.S. Senate position. It did so by sleight-of-hand, in a parenthetical invention: \u201c\u2018targets and timetables\u2019 [was] understood in that context to mean legally binding targets\u201d[2]. This is unsupported, and in Rept. 102-55 the Senate used both terms deliberately, to describe two distinct scenarios: first, any decision \u201cto adopt targets and timetables would have to be submitted to the Senate for its advice and consent before the United States could deposit its instruments of ratification for such an agreement\u201d, which of course describes Paris; \u201cfurther\u201d, any attempt to convert the UNFCCC\u2019s non-binding promise then before the Senate into \u201clegally binding targets and timetables \u2026would alter the \u2018shared understanding\u2019 of the Convention between the Senate and the executive branch and would therefore require the Senate\u2019s advice and consent.\u201d In short, the Obama administration misrepresented the facts to involve the U.S. in Paris, and to avoid a repeat of the Kyoto \u201caccord\u201d which died when the Senate refused to even consider it. President Trump confirmed last month that the U.S. is definitely pulling out of the Paris Accord. As is so often the way with these arrangements \u2013 see also: Brexit \u2013 it\u2019s a lot easier to enter them than it is to exit them. As Daily Caller reports: Trump can\u00a0finally\u00a0make the pullout official Monday. The terms stipulate that a partnering country cannot withdraw within the first three years of submission. Trump can send a letter to the United Nations Monday announcing his intention. It won\u2019t become official until one day after the 2020 election.",

      "subtitle": "Former President Barack Obama may live a stone\u2019s throw away from Virginia now, but his sway over the state\u2019s political landscape came up short on Tuesday.",
      "author": "Haris Alic",
      "content": " Obama, who lives in the elite Washington, DC, enclave of Kalorama, has taken an interest in Virginia politics since leaving the White House. In 2017, the former president endorsed a slate of Democrat candidates running for Virginia\u2019s top three statewide offices. The following year, Obama actively actively hit the campaign trail to see Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA),\u00a0\u00a0a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee and failed vice presidential candidate, reelected. This year was no different, especially with control of the Virginia General Assembly up for grabs. Last weekend, as election day neared, Obama issued an endorsement of 17 legislative candidates, he claimed were ready to advance a slew of liberal priorities in Virginia. Most of the candidates were first time office seekers, with a few incumbents thrown into the mix. \u201cProud to endorse an outstanding group of Virginia Democrats in Tuesday\u2019s election\u2014candidates who\u2019ll not only advance the causes of equality, justice, and decency, but help ensure that the next decade of voting maps are drawn fairly,\u201d the former president wrote on social media. \u201cThat\u2019s good policy\u2014and good for our politics.\u201d  Despite the former president\u2019s rousing endorsement, along with a hefty cash infusion from his allies across the country, a majority of the candidates failed to be elected on Tuesday. The losses by Obama\u2019s preferred candidates came even as Democrats Virginia swept to power in both chambers of the Virginia legislature, setting themselves to control all three branches of state government for the first since 1993. Such an accomplishment, while significant, cannot be attributed to Obama. Of the six Democrats the former president endorsed for the Virginia State Senate only two succeeded in garnering support at the ballot box, while three lost outright. One of the races is still too-close to call, but Republicans maintain a strong lead. Obama endorsed the Democrat candidates in Virginia Senate races in the 7th, 8th, 10th, 11th, 12th, and 13th districts, and lost the 7th, 8th, and 11th districts. The 12th district has the Republican leading by two percent but has not yet been called, meaning Obama only won in the 10th and 13th districts. That means the former president went two for six in state Senate races, a measly 33 percent win rate. Obama had a slightly better, but far from perfect, track record in House of Delegates races.\u00a0In the House of Delegates races, Obama endorsed the Democrat candidates in the 21st, 27th, 28th, 40th, 51st, 66th, 83rd, 84th, 85th, 94th, and 100th districts. Democrats won the 21st, 28th, 40th, 51st, 85th, and 94th districts, and lead a not-yet-called race in the 83rd. Republicans won the 66th and 100th, and currently lead not-yet-called races in the 27th and 84th. Assuming those final margins hold, that means of the 11 candidates Obama endorsed for the House of Delegates, Obama won 7 of them\u2013and the GOP won 4\u2013and went just over 60 percent there. The losses by the Obama-endorsed candidates came even as\u00a0many led their Republican opponents handily in campaign contributions. Missy Cotter Smasal, a small business owner from Virginia Beach, Va., raised $550,000 more than the incumbent Republican she was vying to unseat, according to the Virginia Public Access Project (VPAP). Some of those funds came from top Obama donors like Michael Bills, who along with his donated more than $130,000 to Smasal\u2019s campaign, and groups allied with the former president, including Everytown for Gun Safety.\u00a0The cash lead did not translate to votes tough, as Rodman lost to the incumbent by five percentage points. There is also some evidence that victories by the two Obama-endorsed senate candidates result from factors beyond the former president\u2019s control. In Senate District 10, Ghazala Hashmi defeated incumbent Republican Sen. Glen Sturtevant by slightly more than 8,000 votes after an expensive campaign in which both candidates raised more than two million each. Sturtevant, who won the seat in 2015, was considered the Senate\u2019s most vulnerable Republican because his district, which includes portion of the city of Richmond, is heavily Democratic. According to the VPAP, the 10th Senate District voted for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton over President Donald Trump by a margin of 53 percent to 41 percent in 2016. The district has only grown to favor Democrats in the years since, voting for Gov. Ralph Northam (D-VA) by a 15 percentage points in 2017 and for Kaine by 24 percentage points in 2018. A similar situation played out in Senate District 13 where Obama\u2019s endorsed candidate, John Bell, won an open seat. Bell, who represented portions of the district in the Virginia House of Delegates, easily bested his Republican opponent, the Trump-endorsed Geary Higgins, by more than 7,000 votes. The results were not that surprising given Bell\u2019s fundraising advantage\u2014$2.1 million to Higgins\u2019 $1.3 million\u2014and the district\u2019s Democrat lean. In 2016, Clinton carried it by a margin of six percentage points. Meanwhile, Northam carried it by 11 percentage points on his way to the governorship in 2017 and Kaine won it overwhelmingly by 18 points last year. Although both victories helped ensure Democrat control of the state senate, losses by the four other Obama-endorsed candidates, like Smasal, means the party is likely to only have a one seat majority in the chamber. The former president had more luck with the candidates he endorsed for the Virginia House of Delegates, albeit still failed to see them all elected. In total, six of the 11 Democrats that Obama backed won, while four lost. One race is still outstanding, but the Republican candidate is leading. As with the senate races, there were a bevy of factors behind the results. Two of the candidates Obama threw his support behind, Delegates Hala Ayala and Kelly Convirs-Fowler, were incumbents running for reelection. Both women led the money race by heavy margins, with Ayala raising nearly a million dollars more than her Republican challenger, and were running in territory favorable to Democrats. In fact most of the districts Obama-endorsed candidates won and lost were carried by Clinton in 2016 and Kaine in 2018. Some, like House District 28 in Northern Virginia, were carried by Democrats on Tuesday by small margins than in prior years. In 2016, Clinton won the district by four percentage points, before Kaine carried it by 12 points on his way to reelection last year. On Tuesday, though, the Obama-endorsed Joshua Cole only won the district by a slim margin of roughly four percentage points. A comparable political environment existed in House District 100 on Virginia\u2019s eastern shore, an area that has become increasingly friendly to Democrats in recent years. Even though Kaine won the district by 12 points in his 2018 reelection bid, the Obama-endorsed candidate, Phil Hernandez, failed to unseat the longtime Republican incumbent, Rob Bloxom. Hernandez\u2019s three point loss was especially surprising given that he had out-raised\u00a0Bloxom by more than $500,000. The failure of Obama-backed candidates like Hernandez\u2019s ensures that Democrats will have a slim majority in the Virginia House of Delegates next session. In a twist of irony, the Democrats narrow majority could end up slowing the very advancements in \u201cequality, justice, and decency\u201d the former president invoked when issuing his endorsements last week.",

The women featured in the book were mostly in their 20s when they worked in various offices such as the Department of Homeland Security, the Domestic Policy Council,\u00a0 Office of Digital Strategy, and the\u00a0Office of Faith-based and Neighborhood Partnerships. \u201cWe came of age in the Obama era,\u201d the women wrote in the book\u2019s group prologue, adding that they \u201cwere inspired to join the world of government by [Obama\u2019s] inclusive, feminist politics.\u201d Among the book\u2019s most prominent promoters has been Hillary Clinton, who pushed the book on Twitter in March, writing that \u201cyoung women can run the world.\u201d  Clinton noted that one of the book\u2019s subjects, Andrea Flores, went on to work in her 2016 presidential campaign. Variety reported that High Fidelity\u2018s Veronica West will write and executive produce the new series, which will be produced by ABC Studios. No air date has been announced. ABC isn\u2019t the first studio to create Obama-centric programming. Netflix signed on an overall deal with the Obama\u2019s last year under which the streaming entertainment company will help the former first couple to create and air scripted shows and documentaries.

      "subtitle": "Pete Buttigieg wants to dismiss the \u201cold normal\u201d of politics and run as a change candidate, but the 37-year-old mayor is struggling to avoid including former President Barack Obama in that equation.",
      "author": "Charlie Spiering",
      "content": " The campaign mobilized against Los Angeles Times reporter Evan Halper for mistakenly quoting Buttigig as referring to the \u201cfailures of the Obama era\u201d on the campaign trail, a quote weaponized by his political rivals to damage his campaign. The snafu prompted Buttigieg to recommit his support for the former president on Twitter. \u201cMy appreciation of the great leadership of Barack Obama comes from a very personal place,\u201d he wrote on Twitter.  But Buttigieg\u2019s line about the \u201cfailures of the old normal\u201d include former President Obama, which he reminds political audiences, led to the Trump presidency. The South Bend mayor also spoke about Obama during a conversation with journalist John Heilemann about his campaign. \u201cI also don\u2019t believe we can go back, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s going back to Obama, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s going back to Clinton,\u201d he said in a clip posted by Mediaite\u2019s Tommy Christopher on Twitter.  In November, Buttigieg even claimed he had more executive experience than Obama did in 2007 when he ran for president. \u201cHe had more national exposure sooner than I did. But then I have the benefit of executive experience. So I guess we\u2019re just different,\u201d he told the Atlantic. Since announcing his presidential campaign, Buttigieg has tried to emphasize the contrast with former Vice President Joe Biden (and current senators) by arguing to voters they are part of a \u201cnormal\u201d political system that produced President Donald Trump. \u201cWe are not going to be able to meet this moment by recycling the same arguments, policies, and politicians that have dominated Washington for as long as I have been alive,\u201d Buttigieg said in the first night of the Democrat presidential primary debates in July. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to summon the courage to walk away from the past and do something different.\u201d The effort to appear \u201cdifferent\u201d was part of Obama\u2019s emphasis in the 2007 Democrat presidential primary until his campaign finally caught fire in Iowa and won him the state. Buttigieg even compared his improbable run for president to Obama\u2019s campaign for president, during a speech at the\u00a0Liberty and Justice Celebration dinner\u00a0in Iowa. \u201cThe first time I came to this state was as a volunteer, to knock on doors for a presidential candidate \u2013 a young man with a funny name,\u201d he said. \u201cWe knew the stakes were high then. The stakes are colossal now.\u201d Commentators have observed that Buttigieg is clearly a student of Obama\u2019s\u00a0upset run against failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, by echoing the same rhetoric and offering a break from the past. While Buttigieg wants to break from candidates like former Vice President Joe Biden, he does not want to break from the Obama legacy that he hopes to inherit. It\u2019s a strange paradox of running against the establishment while sounding like the establishment \u2014 at least the politics that Obama established in 2007.",

      "subtitle": "Former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick may have hopes of achieving the Democrat presidential nomination in 2020, but his decision to promote replacement of his state\u2019s high education standards with Common Core in 2010 ultimately led to its fall as a model for the nation.",
      "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
      "content": " The Atlantic chronicled Patrick\u2019s close relationship with former President Barack Obama Thursday, asserting Patrick is Obama\u2019s \u201crightful heir,\u201d \u201can actual longtime friend based on mutual affinities.\u201d That friendship was the basis for the decision by Patrick a decade ago to work to replace the high academic standards that gave Massachusetts its top ranking among states in the country with the Obama-incentivized Common Core State Standards. Common Core was sold as a social justice reform that \u2013 above all else \u2013 would close the achievement gap between largely white, middle-income students and the mostly black and Hispanic students from lower-income families. That effort has failed abysmally, as Peggy Carr, associate commissioner of the National Center for Education Statistics, lamented in October after the results of the Nation\u2019s Report Card assessments showed U.S. public school children have made \u201cno progress\u201d in reading or mathematics over the ten years. \u201cOver the past decade, there has been no progress in either mathematics or reading performance, and the lowest-performing students are doing worse,\u201d Carr said, according to\u00a0Education Week. \u201cIn fact,\u00a0over the long term in reading, the lowest-performing students\u2014those readers who struggle the most\u2014have made no progress\u00a0from the first NAEP administration almost 30 years ago.\u201d Jamie Gass, director of the Center for School Reform at the Boston-based Pioneer Institute, and Charles Chieppo, a senior fellow at Pioneer, wrote specifically about Common Core\u2019s effect on Massachusetts at the American Conservative in May. While the Bay State had been one of three states to make progress in closing the achievement gap between 1998 and 2009, the trajectory changed when Patrick pushed the legislature to adopt Common Core. Gass and Chieppo summarized: When the Obama administration kicked off its push to federalize public education by making adoption of Common Core English and math standards a condition of receiving federal grant money, Massachusetts acquiesced. It adopted the standards in 2010. Common Core cut the amount of classic literature, drama, and poetry that Massachusetts students study by 60 percent. The math standards, which Stanford University mathematics professor emeritus R. James Milgram called \u201cshopping cart math,\u201d no longer get students to algebra by eighth grade. Subsequent revisions also dumbed down the Bay State\u2019s science and U.S. history standards. In 2009, then-governor Deval Patrick\u2019s administration brushed aside the state law that required history to join English, math, and science as a high-stakes test. Instead he pushed new age fads, including educating the \u201cwhole child\u201d and vacuous \u201c21st-century skills.\u201d The results of Massachusetts\u2019 decision to adopt the education \u201creform\u201d known as Common Core came fast. Though the state remains among the top performing in the nation, state scores have \u201ceither stagnated or declined in both English and math,\u201d wrote the Pioneer authors. \u201cIn the Common Core era, the Bay State was among those that saw the biggest declines in math,\u201d they observed. As might have been predicted, however, in January 2015, Obama-era Education Secretary Arne Duncan gave a glowing tribute to Patrick in an op-ed at the Boston Globe, praising the outgoing governor, claiming the state of Massachusetts had led the nation in education under the direction of the Common Core champion Patrick. \u201cIn many ways, Massachusetts is now helping to lead the country where it needs to go in education,\u201d Duncan said. However, Pioneer\u2019s executive director Jim Stergios countered in an op-ed, also at the Globe. \u201cWho says Common Core advocates don\u2019t like fiction?\u201d Stergios challenged. \u201cUS Education Secretary Arne Duncan got one fact right: Massachusetts leads the nation in education. Attributing that progress to Governor Patrick\u2019s leadership is like suggesting that a pinch runner who finds himself on third base hit a triple.\u201d Stergios noted Massachusetts had held the highest spot in all subjects on national assessments for a decade, and that prior to Patrick\u2019s inauguration in 2007, the state had already been identified as \u201cone of the fastest improving states in the nation.\u201d In addition, just several months into that year, Massachusetts students had been ranked on international math and science assessments with the top six countries. \u201cOnly a politician, or an education secretary playing one, would attribute Massachusetts\u2019 success to Patrick,\u201d Stergios asserted.\u00a0\u201cThe best one can say about overall student achievement in the Commonwealth during Patrick\u2019s terms in office is that it has been stagnant.\u00a0An objective observer would note significant areas of decline.\u201d The Pioneer executive director noted that, since the Common Core\u2019s adoption in Massachusetts, \u201csampled national tests show fourth-grade reading scores, the best predictor of future success, falling more significantly in Massachusetts than anywhere else in the country.\u201d The state\u2019s SAT scores had dropped 20 points during Patrick\u2019s tenure as well though, prior to becoming governor, the SAT scores had \u201crisen for 13 consecutive years.\u201d Yet another reason to question Duncan\u2019s praise for Patrick\u2014and the Common Core standards\u2014was Stergios\u2019 observation that, prior to 2007, \u201c67 percent of third graders scored advanced or proficient on the state\u2019s third-grade reading tests\u2026 that number is now 57 percent.\u201d Stergios wrote Patrick\u2019s decision to join the Obama administration in its push for Common Core led to the governor\u2019s desertion of \u201ctwo pillars of Massachusetts\u2019 original, bold reforms \u2014 academic content standards that approached those in the highest-performing nations and a unique accountability system focused on improving district leadership and performance.\u201d",

Pressley veered from her colleagues, throwing her weight behind Warren, who has also proposed ultra-far left proposals, including Medicare for All and an \u201cUltra-Millionaire\u201d tax. Obama continued, according to the Times: I don\u2019t think we should be deluded into thinking that the resistance to certain approaches to things is simply because voters haven\u2019t heard a bold enough proposal and if they hear something as bold as possible then immediately that\u2019s going to activate them. \u201cFor those who get stressed about robust primaries, I just have to remind you I had a very robust primary,\u201d Obama added. \u201cI\u2019m confident that at the end of the process we will have a candidate that has been tested.\u201d Obama has yet to throw his support behind any of the current Democrat candidates, including his former running mate and vice president Joe Biden (D). Obama ally Deval Patrick (D), former governor of Massachusetts, recently jumped into the race \u00ad\u2013 a move Breitbart News\u2019s John Nolte described as a slap in the face to Biden: Well, Patrick and Obama\u00a0are close. In fact, Obama tried to talk Patrick into running last year, but was turned down. Patrick feared the ugliness of the race, his wife was ill, and he was probably thrilled to be making a pile of money giving women cancer. But Patrick is getting in now, isn\u2019t he? And it is more than fair to assume he\u2019s getting in because Obama begged him to. The reasons are obvious\u2026 As is being reported everywhere, the smoke-filled-room fellas, the leaders of the Democrat Party, the money men, the Obamas, etc., are terrified of Warren\u2019s socialistic tendencies, know Buttigieg is too young and too gay\u2026 But most of all they know Old Joe Biden just doesn\u2019t have the stuff. To be fair, Slow Joe never had the stuff. He\u2019s always been a terrible presidential candidate, and there are reports Obama tried to discourage him from running. Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, another major Obama figure, is also reportedly considering a longshot presidential bid, further adding to the growing belief that establishment Democrats \u2013\u00a0Obama and Hillary Clinton included \u2013\u00a0are increasingly worried by what the current Democrat field has to offer.",

      "subtitle": "WASHINGTON, DC \u2014 Former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Jeffrey Piatt in 2015 joined three impeachment probe witnesses in calling for an investigation into the corruption-linked Burisma company and its owner while then Vice-President\u2019s Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, was working at the Ukrainian company.",
      "author": "Edwin Mora",
      "content": " Piatt [or Pyatt], who preceded former U.S. Ukraine Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, is the fourth official who worked under former President Barack Obama to raise malfeasance concerns about Burisma. Piatt, however, is the only individual who has not testified in the ongoing impeachment probe to deem a corruption investigation into Burisma necessary. The four complainants against Burisma suggest there is merit to U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s concerns about Hunter Biden\u2019s work on the company\u2019s board of directors. Corruption concerns about Burisma began with allegations against the Ukranian company\u2019s owner, Mykola Zlochevsy. The United States spent hundreds of thousands helping to investigate Zlochevsy. Combating corruption in Ukraine has long been a significant component of American policy towards Ukraine. House Democrats, however, refuse to allow Hunter to testify, denying that he is at the center of the impeachment probe. During the public impeachment probe hearing Tuesday, featuring testimony from U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, testified Rep. Devin Nunes from California, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee hosting the hearing, declared: You wouldn\u2019t be the first ambassador to be interested in Burisma, did you know that in 2015, U.S. Amb. Jeffrey Piatt\u2019s as U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine privately called fro an investigation into Zlochevsky, the president of Burisma. This [Piatt] is the Ukrainian ambassador appointed by Obama in Ukraine.\n\n\u2026 You would not be the first one to be mentioning that investigations should be done into Burisma because it happened under the Obama administration. Did you know that financial records show Burisma routed more $3 million into the account of Hunter Biden. Sondland claimed he was not aware of Piatt\u2019s concerns about Burisma. He also claimed ignorance of the company\u2019s decision to route more than $3 million over five years to accounts linked to Hunter Biden. Hunter served on the Ukrainian company\u2019s board directors while his father was President Obama\u2019s head honcho for Ukraine policy. Impeachment probe witnesses \u2014\u00a0George Kent, Catherine Croft, and Christopher Anderson \u2014 all raised concerns about Burisma\u2019s potential affiliation to corruption, at times when Hunter was working there. Besides former Amb. Piatt, Kent, Croft, and Anderson still all work for the State Department. They did so when they expressed concerns about Burisma. Kent testified during his October 15 closed-door deposition that he raised concerns about Burisma and its owners, but VP Biden\u2019s office ignored him. U.S. Special Envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker\u00a0and Sondland had both called for investigations into Burisma and its owner, to no avail. Echoing Volker, Sondland said during his public testimony Tuesday that an investigation into corruption allegations against Burisma would be appropriate. Trump\u2019s private attorney Rudy Giuliani traveled to Ukraine to investigate Ukraine\u2019s possible efforts to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential elections. Democrats and their mainstream media allies argue there is no wrongdoing evidence against the Bidens. At the behest of VP Biden, however, information into the matter was buried. Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor Viktor Shokin who had investigated Burisma, threatening to withhold loan guarantees if it did not play ball. If that sounds familiar, you have been paying attention, because it sounds like the quid pro quo that Dems are trying to pin on Trump. \u201cShokin\u2019s replacement, Yuri Lutsenko, continued the investigation into Burisma and concluded there was no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe Biden or his son,\u201d the New York Post noted. Corruption, however, is prevalent in Ukraine and could have played a role in clearing the Bidens. Russian Ryaboshapka, the new prosecutor under Zelensky \u2014 who ran on combating corruption, has vowed to \u201creview all previous cases concerning [the Burisma] gas company at the heart of the impeachment inquiry into President Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine,\u201d the Washington Post reported on October 4. A U.S. intelligence community \u201cwhistleblower\u201d complaint filed August 12 accuses Trump of engaging in a quid pro quo during a July 25 call in which he allegedly pressured Zelensky to investigate the Bidens in exchange for aid, The testimony from four State officials shows that Obama knew of corruption concerns about Burisma. U.S. State testimony about corruption suggests there could be merit to Trump suggesting Ukraine investigate corruption allegations linked to the Bidens. Hunter admitted getting the lucrative job at Burisma because of his father\u2019s position. Even officials who have testified against Trump\u2019s interactions in Ukraine have said there was no pressure for the Eastern European country to investigate the Bidens. House Democrats are not allowing the Republicans to request the \u201cwhistleblower,\u201d whose complaint alleging a quid pro quo trigge\u00e5d the impeachment probe, and Hunter Biden to testify.",

      "content": " Under questioning from Republicans, Hill admitted that she herself had been against giving weapons to Ukraine to help it fight Russian invasion, and that she had written an op-ed in the Washington Post expressing those views. She also said that the \u201cinteragency consensus\u201d had actually been in favor of arming the Ukrainians; she herself was not in government service at the time, but working at the liberal Brookings Institution think tank. Hill noted that President Obama had ignored the \u201cinteragency consensus\u201d for what she called \u201cpolitical\u201d reasons. She explained that Obama was concerned that arming the Ukrainians could provoke the Russians. On Tuesday, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, who worked for Hill and remains at the National Security Council, testified that President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to withhold aid from Ukraine temporarily went against the \u201cinteragency consensus\u201d on Ukraine, though he also acknowledged that Trump had armed Ukraine while Obama had not. Democrats say that Trump hurt U.S. national security by jeopardizing American support for Ukraine, and ignoring the \u201cinteragency consensus,\u201d for what they claim are political reasons.

In September 2014, AFSA\u2019s journal noted Holmes served in Afghanistan 2007-2008, India 2008-2010, and as special assistant for South and Central Asia to then Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Bill Burns in 2011 and 2012. The Foreign Service Journal reported: Through this experience Holmes came to believe that the division of authority between the Office of Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan and the Bureau of Central and South Asian Affairs \u201chindered our diplomatic effectiveness an deprived policy makers of coordinated strategic advice.\u201d For speaking out on this issue Holmes received the 2014 William R. Rivkin Award for constructive dissent by a mid-level FSO [Foreign Service Officer]. The article includes a photo of Holmes meeting with President Barack Obama in the White House and another photo of Holmes holding his award. (The Foreign Service Journal) (The Foreign Service Journal) In September 2014 the AFSA website published a story about staffers who had won dissent awards, including Holmes: This year was the first since 2006 that AFSA has presented all four dissent awards (they are conferred only when a fitting recipient is identified). This year, too, the number of deserving nominations received for exemplary performance awards surpassed that of previous years. \u201cIn the non-business- as-usual approach of the office of the SRAP,\u201d his award nomination states, \u201cDavid Holmes was both a dedicated team player in shaping our policies, as well as a courageous advocate for doing so in a more coordinated and strategic way.\u201d (AFSA) Holmes was featured in a photo in another meeting in the White House with Obama in a bizarre story in the New York Post about White House lawyer Avril Haines, who Obama had named as the deputy director of the CIA. (Official White House photo/Pete Souza) The Post story explained how before her work in the Obama administration Haines operated a bookstore in Baltimore, where she held erotica readings. AFSA also used a photo of Holmes seated with Obama on Air Force One on the cover of its journal in September 2014 on the dissent winners: (The Foreign Service Journal) National Public Radio (NPR) wrote about Holmes and his reputation at the State Department: \u201cHis message was so good and so influential that it went all the way to the secretary of state,\u201d said Eric Rubin, an active duty foreign service officer and president of the American Foreign Service Association. Rubin, who also received the award in 1994, made clear it is not about whistleblowers, but rather recognizing someone who feels strongly enough to put themselves on record for voicing views on policy that may differ from the administration. In his testimony before the House Intelligence Committee\u2019s impeachment hearing on Thursday, Holmes was critical of Trump\u2019s approach to foreign policy that includes involving people who are not part of the \u201cinteragency\u201d chain of command.

      "author": "Breitbart News",
      "content": " Obama spoke to about 100 donors during a question-and-answer session with Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez in Los Altos Hills, California. The event came a day after the fifth Democratic presidential primary in Atlanta and as the 17-person field continues to expand, with the expected entry of former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg in the coming days. Until recently, Obama largely refrained from opining publicly on the Democratic contest, and his move from the sidelines comes at a moment of deep uncertainty for the party. Many are jittery about the uneven candidacy of his former Vice President Joe Biden, questioning whether Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren can defeat President Donald Trump next year, and skeptical of whether Pete Buttigieg, the South Bend, Indiana, mayor who is surging in Iowa, can appeal to black voters that are a crucial Democratic voting bloc. \u201cWe will not win just by increasing the turnout of the people who already agree with us completely on everything,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWhich is why I am always suspicious of purity tests during elections. Because, you know what, the country is complicated.\u201d Obama urged Democrats to \u201cchill out,\u201d saying, \u201cThe truth of the matter is that every candidate on that stage believes we should provide\u201d better health care and education and address climate change. He also noted the historic diversity of the Democratic field, which now includes five women, three black candidates, a Latino man and a gay man. He compared that to his own election as the nation\u2019s first black president. \u201cWe have a number of women candidates and we have one gay candidate. And those candidates are going to have barriers if they win the nomination, or they win the general election \u2014 just like I did,\u201d Obama told donors. \u201cYou can overcome that resistance if the way you are framing these issues and messages indicate, \u2019Look, I\u2019m part of an American tradition \u2026 of opening up opportunity.\u201d In recent weeks Obama has sought to play both referee and uplifting elder statesman. He\u2019s cautioned \u201cwoke\u201d activists against embracing \u201ccancel culture\u201d and urged the party to not adopt positions that could cost them in the general election. \u201cThat\u2019s not bringing about change,\u201d he said during a recent Obama Foundation event. \u201cIf all you are doing is casting stones, you\u2019re probably not going to get that far.\u201d At the same time, he has offered reassurances that a spirited primary will make the eventual nominee a stronger candidate. It comes amid a fierce intraparty debate that has divided centrists and an ascendant progressive wing, which has advocated for policies like free college tuition and \u201cMedicare for All\u201d that would dramatically reshape the role of government in peoples\u2019 lives. Elections are ultimately won by offering a message that appeals to voters across the demographic spectrum, Obama said. \u201cWe should not be somehow thinking either we\u2019re going for our base voter of young hipsters and African Americans and single women versus Joe lunch-pail, hard-hat guy,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause you know what? \u2026 I\u2019ve had conversations with all those groups, and they share common dreams and common hopes and a vision for what a fair, just America would look like.\u201d The fundraiser Thursday was held at the home of Karla Jurvetson, a prominent Democratic donor and Silicon Valley philanthropist. The event raised more than $3 million for the Democratic National Committee, according to a senior party official.",

      "content": " Speaking at a campaign town hall in Greenwood, South Carolina, the former vice president was confronted by activists from a radical immigrant rights group called Movimiento Cosecha. Initially, a member of the group told Biden it was difficult as an immigrant to trust him because of\u00a0his defense of the three million deportations that occurred under President Barack Obama\u2019s tenure in office. The activist, who addressed Biden in Spanish through a translator, asked the former vice president if he would commit to ending such deportations through executive action on his first day in office. \u201cNo, I will not stop all deportations,\u201d Biden responded. \u201cI will prioritize deportations, only people who have committed a felony or a serious crime.\u201d The answer seemed not to please the Carlos Rojas, the activist who was translating for the initial questioner. Rojas, who claimed to have been a volunteer for Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign, began lecturing Biden about the deportations that occurred during his service in the vice presidency. Biden, for his part, seemed unwilling to indulge the activist. \u201cYou should vote for Trump,\u201d the former vice president cut off Rojas mid-sentence as the activist was laying out the Obama administration\u2019s record on immigration.\u201dYou should vote for Trump,\u201d Biden repeated mockingly. \u201cNo, I am not going to do that,\u201d Rojas responded, before demanding Biden pledge to end all deportations if elected in president. \u201cWe want to hear you say that.\u201d The former vice president tried to double down on his promise to not stop deportations for those that commit felonies, but was met with shouts of \u201cnot one more deportation\u201d by the crowd.  After the confrontation Movimiento Cosecha, issued a statement denouncing the former vice president\u2019s refusal to support a \u201cfull moratorium\u201d on deportations. \u201cBy now, it is clear that the immigrant community cannot trust Biden,\u201d Rojas said in the statement. \u201cWe won\u2019t accept empty promises of immigration reform, while our families are torn apart. We cannot allow history to repeat itself.\u201d This is not the first time that Biden has faced trouble over his immigration position on the campaign trail. In July, one day after his campaign headquarters was stormed by open borders protesters, the former vice president was confronted by an immigration activist in New Hampshire. The activist, who claimed to be undergoing deportation proceedings, demanded that Biden \u201capologize to the three million immigrants that were deported and separated from their families under the Obama years.\u201d The former vice president simply smirked\u00a0at the cameras taping the altercation, before telling the activist he would do no such thing. \u201cI will not apologize for the deportation of people who have committed a felony,\u201d Biden said at the time.",

      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " Warren answered a question about the ongoing partisan impeachment hearing during Wednesday evening\u2019s Democrat debate and mentioned Ambassador Gordon Sondland \u2013 a key witness of the Democrats who testified that Trump told him, \u201cI want nothing. I want no quid pro quo\u201d \u2013 and contended he landed his position due to his status as a big donor. She said: But I want to add one more part based on today\u2019s testimony, and that is, how did Ambassador Sondland get there? You know, this is not a man who had any qualifications, except one: He wrote a check for a million dollars. And that tells us about what\u2019s happening in Washington, the corruption, how money buys its way into Washington. You know, I raised this months ago about the whole notion that donors think they\u2019re going to get ambassadorships on the other side. And I\u2019ve taken a pledge. Anyone who wants to give me a big donation, don\u2019t ask to be an ambassador, because I\u2019m not going to have that happen. I asked everyone who\u2019s running for president to join me in that and not a single person has so far. I hope what we saw today during the testimony means lots of people will sign on and say we are not going to give away these ambassador posts to the highest bidder. She also released an ad, reiterating the point she made during the debate. Warren states in the ad: At the center of Donald Trump\u2019s crimes and chaos is the millionaire donor he made an ambassador Republicans and Democrats have been rewarding big donors with cushy ambassadorships like this for years. It\u2019s Washington corruption at its worst. When I\u2019m president, that stops. I\u2019m the only candidate running who\u2019s made this promise. I\u2019ll never give ambassadorships to\u00a0unqualified donors just because they wrote me fat checks.  However, Warren did not seem to take issue with the concept during Obama\u2019s tenure, confirming his nominees who held no diplomatic experience. One of those nominees included Hollywood producer\u00a0Colleen Bell, whose experience amounted to raising $2 million for Obama\u2019s campaigns. Despite that, he nominated her to be the ambassador to Hungary. \u201cDuring her confirmation hearing, Bell\u00a0failed\u00a0to name a single strategic interest the United States has in Hungary,\u201d as the Washington Free Beacon reported. Nevertheless, Warren confirmed her. More via Free Beacon: Warren was a senator, for example, when Obama nominated Noah Bryson Mamet to be U.S. ambassador to Argentina\u2014Mamet was a\u00a0political operative\u00a0with no diplomatic experience who\u00a0raised millions of dollars\u00a0for Obama\u2019s presidential campaigns. It was revealed during Mamet\u2019s confirmation hearing that he had\u00a0never been to Argentina. Warren voted to\u00a0confirm\u00a0Mamet, who passed through the Senate with 50 votes and none from Republicans. \u2026 Warren also voted to\u00a0confirm\u00a0Crystal Nix-Hines, who\u00a0wrote scripts\u00a0for ABC\u2019s\u00a0Alias\u00a0and\u00a0raised over $1 million\u00a0for Obama, to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization. An analysis by the\u00a0Center for Public Integrity\u00a0found that Obama rewarded 31 of his campaign bundlers with ambassador posts during his second term. Another 39 ambassador nominees \u201ceither gave him campaign money or are known political allies.\u201d Warren has yet to publicly address the reasoning behind her previous votes that directly contradict the position she outlines in her presidential platform.",

With several lesser-known candidates, according to people who have talked to him or been briefed on his meetings, he was blunt about the challenges of breaking out of a large field. His advice is not always heeded. He told Patrick earlier this year that it was likely \u201ctoo late\u201d for him to secure \u201cmoney and talent\u201d if he jumped in the race. Occasionally, he can be cutting. With one candidate, he pointed out that during his own 2008 campaign, he had an intimate bond with the electorate, especially in Iowa, that he no longer has. Then he added, \u201cAnd you know who really doesn\u2019t have it? Joe Biden.\u201d Obama\u2019s remarks about Biden\u2019s issues in Hawkeye State are reflected in his falling poll numbers. \u201cAccording to the latest\u00a0CBS News Battleground Tracker poll, Biden is down eight points in Iowa from June to November to leave him tied with Senator Bernie Sanders at 22% as the top choice among registered Iowa Democrats. They were just ahead of South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg (21%) and Senator Elizabeth Warren (18%). Other recent polls have shown Biden polling as low as fourth within that top tier, CBS News said. Obama\u2019s brutal assessment of Biden\u2019s performance on the trail, which has been a constant source of concern for Democratic Party officials and primary voters, is sure to add to the narrative that the former president has little\u00a0\u2014 if any \u2014 faith in his former number two\u2019s ability to secure the nomination. Obama infamously did not endorse Biden\u2019s latest White House bid.\u00a0In a\u00a060 Minutes\u00a0interview,\u00a0the former vice president claimed Obama\u2019s silence was at his own request. \u201cI asked him not to,\u201d Biden said.\u00a0\u201cI think it\u2019s better \u2014 I think he thinks it\u2019s better for me.\u201d While Lizza acknowledges this public statement, he writes that Biden \u201cwanted a nudge\u201d and was \u201cinfuriated\u201d by the former president\u2019s reclusive approach to this political cycle. News of Obama\u2019s criticisms about Biden comes as the former president has become more vocal about the 2020 primary content. Obama warned Democrats on Thursday against adopting \u201cpurity tests\u201d in the presidential primary and said any adversity the candidates face in the contest will make whoever emerges an even stronger nominee. Obama spoke to about 100 donors during a question-and-answer session with Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez in Los Altos Hills, California. Until recently, Obama largely refrained from opining publicly on the Democratic contest, and his move from the sidelines comes at a moment of deep uncertainty for the party. Many are jittery about the uneven candidacy of Biden, questioning whether Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) can defeat President Trump next year, and skeptical of whether Pete Buttigieg, the South Bend, Indiana, mayor who is surging in Iowa, can appeal to black voters that are a crucial Democratic voting bloc. \u201cWe will not win just by increasing the turnout of the people who already agree with us completely on everything,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWhich is why I am always suspicious of purity tests during elections. Because, you know what, the country is complicated.\u201d Obama urged Democrats to \u201cchill out,\u201d saying, \u201cThe truth of the matter is that every candidate on that stage believes we should provide\u201d better health care and education and address climate change.

Obama has remained notably silent throughout the Democrat primary\u00a0 \u2013 a development that should come to no surprise to those closely following the race. The former president signaled he would not endorse a primary candidate or speak out in an overly critical manner of any of the presidential hopefuls. According to Politico, Obama views his role as \u201cproviding guardrails to keep the process from getting too ugly and to unite the party when the nominee is clear.\u201d Obama has, largely, stuck to that strategy, refusing to endorse his former running mate Joe Biden (D) and refraining from encouraging the presidential aspirations of his \u201cclose friend\u201d Holder, who teamed up with\u00a0Obama\u2019s Organizing For Action to create the\u00a0All On The Line campaign, a redistricting project \u201caimed at thwarting the use of so-called gerrymandering across the country.\u201d While reports, as recently as early November, indicated\u00a0Holder was still mulling a last-minute presidential bid, the doors are slowly closing. Politico\u00a0reported Holder was reportedly \u201cfrustrated\u201d Obama did not encourage his plans for a presidential bid, with a source close to Holder telling the outlet that \u201che\u2019s [Holder\u2019s] still pretty sensitive about it.\u201d The source said Biden\u2019s bid threw a political wrench in Holder\u2019s plans, because the two \u201chave the same set of people,\u201d making a run far too complicated. But now, Biden\u2019s lackluster performances \u2013 in both the debates and on the campaign trail \u2013 are proving the initial concerns of many within the Democrat establishment, which is \u201creally frustrating to Eric.\u201d \u201cHe was really frustrated about having arrived at the decision not to run. Holder couldn\u2019t get in because Biden and Holder have the same set of people. Once Biden was getting in then Eric couldn\u2019t get in. So that frustrated Holder,\u201d the source said. \u201cIt blocked him,\u201d the source added. \u201cAnd Biden has turned out the way they all feared, and that\u2019s really frustrating to Eric.\u201d Nonetheless, Obama has also refrained from actively endorsing his former running mate \u2013 the man evidently responsible for quashing Holder\u2019s 2020 bid. The former president reportedly said, prior to Biden\u2019s entry into the race, that the former vice president would have to \u201cearn\u201d the nomination without his endorsement. It remains to be seen if Michael Bloomberg\u2019s late entry will affect Holder\u2019s decision to stay out of the race.",

      "author": "Hannah Bleau",
      "content": " Patrick, who Politico describes as a \u201cclose Obama pal and board member at the Obama Foundation,\u201d announced his longshot presidential bid on November 14, which came as a stark contrast to the position he took in December 2018, telling supporters \u201ca 2020 campaign for president is not for me.\u201d \u201cIn a spirit of profound gratitude for all the country has given to me, with a determination to build a better, more sustainable, more inclusive American Dream for the next generation, I am today announcing my candidacy for President of the United States,\u201d Patrick, who reportedly called Obama prior to his announcement, said in a video:  According to Politico, Obama warned Patrick this year that it was \u201ctoo late\u201d for him to run, citing the \u201cmoney and talent\u201d needed to proceed with a successful campaign. As Politico reported: Sometimes he offers candid advice about his visitors\u2019 strengths and weaknesses. With several lesser-known candidates, according to people who have talked to him or been briefed on his meetings, he was blunt about the challenges of breaking out of a large field. His advice is not always heeded. He told Patrick earlier this year that it was likely \u201ctoo late\u201d for him to secure \u201cmoney and talent\u201d if he jumped in the race. Occasionally, he can be cutting. With one candidate, he pointed out that during his own 2008 campaign, he had an intimate bond with the electorate, especially in Iowa, that he no longer has. Then he added, \u201cAnd you know who really doesn\u2019t have it? Joe Biden.\u201d Patrick has yet to gain traction following his announcement. He opted to cancel an event at Morehouse College at the last minute last week after only two people showed up:   Patrick is not the only Democrat hopeful who Obama has discouraged. Former Attorney General Eric Holder, a \u201cclose friend\u201d to Obama, was reportedly \u201cfrustrated\u201d by the former president refraining from encouraging his presidential aspirations. \u201dHe\u2019s still pretty sensitive about it,\u201d a source close to Holder told Politico. \u201cHe was really frustrated about having arrived at the decision not to run.

It blocked him,\u201d the source added. \u201cAnd Biden has turned out the way they all feared, and that\u2019s really frustrating to Eric.\u201d While Obama has signaled he will not endorse a Democrat primary candidate and has yet to issue a stark criticism to any one candidate by name, he has taken veiled shots at some of the more \u201cradical candidates\u201d among leftist donors. \u201cEven as we push the envelope and we are bold in our vision we also have to be rooted in reality,\u201d Obama told a group of left-wing donors in Washington, DC, this month. \u201cThe average American doesn\u2019t think we have to completely tear down the system and remake it,\u201d he continued. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should be deluded into thinking that the resistance to certain approaches to things is simply because voters haven\u2019t heard a bold enough proposal and if they hear something as bold as possible then immediately that\u2019s going to activate them,\u201d he added. According to Politico, Obama has also been \u201cskeptical about the prospects of Mayor Pete Buttigieg,\u201d unsure of Sen. Kamala Harris\u2019s (D-CA) appeal among black voters, and privately said that a Warren nomination would be a \u201crepudiation\u201d of him when she considered running in 2015. Despite his purported uneasiness over some of the candidates, Obama \u201csees his role as providing guardrails to keep the process from getting too ugly and to unite the party when the nominee is clear,\u201d according to Politico.",

      "author": "John Nolte",
      "content": " The longish piece is written by CNN\u2019s Ryan Lizza, who was fired from the New Yorker in 2017 over credible allegations of sexual misconduct, and it\u2019s the usual-usual from this crowd: unnamed sources, friends of friends\u2026 So you have to assume most of it is either fake news or the use of selective sources that allow the writer to spread the selective message of his choice. One thing that did ring true to me, though, is Team Biden\u2019s obvious anger and frustration over Obama\u2019s silence, over his refusal to defend Biden from the growing Ukraine scandal. Here\u2019s the relevant portion: One person who is very close to both Obama and Biden said the only time the Biden campaign has been disappointed in Obama is over Trump\u2019s Ukraine scandal. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody in the Biden world challenges Obama\u2019s affection for Biden, or challenges his strategy of not weighing in for anybody,\u201d this person said. \u201dI do think there\u2019s frustration when Joe Biden and Hunter Biden get attacked by Republicans on the Ukrainian thing and they say, \u2019Obama and his administration looked the other way back when this was happening,\u2019 and Obama doesn\u2019t say anything. The Biden people ask, \u2018Why won\u2019t Obama say something?\u2019\u201d \u201cWhy won\u2019t Obama say something?\u201d Well, let me see if I can answer that question for you, but first a recap\u2026 While serving as president, Obama put his vice president, Joe Biden, in charge of diplomatic relations with Ukraine. While Joe was in this influential position, the corrupt oligarch of a corrupt energy company called Burisma paid Joe\u2019s son Hunter $50,000 a month \u2014 a month! \u2014 to sit on the company\u2019s board. This, despite the fact Hunter does not know anything about energy and does not even speak the local language. Worse still, when a local prosecutor started to looking into Burisma, Joe has openly bragged about how he used the threat of withholding U.S. aid to force Ukraine to fire the prosecutor, which they did. And now, thanks to Adam Schiff\u2019s failed (and then some) impeachment hearings, we know that, at the time, the Obama administration was greatly concerned about this obvious conflict of interest, so\u2026 Why would Obama defend Joe, when what Joe and Hunter did was indefensible? Why would Obama pour gasoline all over this fire, when Obama is likely furious at his former wingman for placing this black mark on his presidential legacy? Obama is many things, but he is no dummy, and he knows that if Biden wins the nomination that Trump is going to not only pulverize Biden with Ukraine, he is going to spread that Ukraine stink all over the Obama administration that allowed Hunter\u2019s looting spree to occur. My guess is that Obama would not only like to see Joe\u2019s presidential campaign go away, he would like to see this entire impeachment fiasco disappear. Here\u2019s a glimpse into Obama\u2019s future\u2026 If Pelosi decides to go ahead and impeach Trump (and I think she has no choice at this point if she wants to keep the Democrat base happy), then this goes to the Senate for a trial, a Senate run by Republicans who will never vote to remove Trump over a hoax. But\u2026 Senate Republicans have made it clear that they intend to use the trial to pour a spotlight on Joe and Hunter Biden\u2019s indefensible corruption \u2014 which will, of course, damage Obama\u2019s legacy. So, yeah, Obama\u2019s not speaking up because he\u2019s almost certainly furious with Biden over all of this, and has every right to be. Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

      "author": "Penny Starr",
      "content": " Two of the candidates seem to be the ones whose campaign promises imply Obama didn\u2019t do enough to advance progressivism while in office \u2014 Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and\u00a0Bernie Sanders (I-VT): Publicly, he has been clear that he won\u2019t intervene in the primary for or against a candidate, unless he believed there was some egregious attack. \u201cI can\u2019t even imagine with this field how bad it would have to be for him to say something,\u201d said a close adviser. Instead, he sees his role as providing guardrails to keep the process from getting too ugly and to unite the party when the nominee is clear. There is one potential exception: Back when Sanders seemed like more of a threat than he does now, Obama said privately that if Bernie were running away with the nomination, Obama would speak up to stop him. (Asked about that, a spokesperson for Obama pointed out that Obama recently said he would support and campaign for whoever the Democratic nominee is.) If Bernie were running away with it, I think maybe we would all have to say something. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s likely. It\u2019s not happening.\u201d (Another close Obama friend said, \u201cBernie\u2019s not a Democrat.\u201d) As for Warren, the candidate who has tried to bridge the worlds of Sanders and Obama, Obama\u2019s relationship with Warren is famously complicated. Back in early 2015, when Warren was considering running for president and started to excite progressives, Obama said privately that if Democrats rallied around her as their nominee it would be a repudiation of him\u2014a clear sign that his economic decisions after the Great Recession had been seen as inadequate. There are very few former senior Obama officials in Warren\u2019s campaign. As for the other candidates, little support can be found from the former president. \u201cObama was deeply skeptical about the prospects of Mayor Pete Buttigieg,\u201d one of Obama\u2019s \u201cclosest advisers\u201d said in the article. \u201cThey discussed doubts about Kamala Harris\u2019 appeal to African Americans,\u201d the article said. As for Steve Bullock, Obama spoke for himself: \u201cNobody knows who you are,\u201d he said. Obama adviser David Axelrod said, \u201cI mean is Michael Bloomberg really the default candidate for non-college educated white voters?\u201d \u201cMaybe Amy [Klobuchar], but I honestly don\u2019t think she\u2019s getting out of Iowa,\u201d Axelrod said. The article tries to paint Obama as a moderate compared to this field of candidates, including Warren and Sanders and their Medicare for All schemes. He is more favorable of former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s and Buttigieg\u2019s healthcare plans. But that\u2019s not to say Obama is ready to buy any bumper stickers. \u201cAnother adviser added, \u2018I don\u2019t think he was trying to benefit Biden here. Buttigieg benefits from this too. Knowing Obama as well as I do, he doesn\u2019t want to help anyone or hurt anyone, he just wants to win the 2020 election,\u2019\u201d the article said. Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) is only mentioned once in the article as one of the candidates who has sought advice from Obama. Follow Penny Starr on Twitter.",

      "author": "Sean Moran",
      "content": " Oracle filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District in Washington, D.C., challenging the legality of the adjudication established by the DOL\u2019s Office of Federal Contract Compliance (OFCCP) for discrimination claims against government contractors, according to a press release obtained by Breitbart News. Oracle alleged Congress nor the president had authorized this system and usurped the role of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). The technology company alleged that, under the current system, claims under government contractors are not prosecuted under federal courts. Instead, they argued, the DOL \u201cserves as investigator, prosecutor, judge, jury, and appellate court, usurping the role of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the Department of Justice and the Courts.\u201d Ken Glueck, executive vice president of Oracle, said, \u201cOracle filed this case because it is being subjected to an unlawful enforcement action by the Labor Department utilizing a process with no statutory foundation whatsoever.\u201d Right before former President Barack Obama left office, his Department of Labor sued Oracle for allegedly discriminating against government contractors. The lawsuit originated from a routine audit of Oracle\u2019s hiring and pay in 2014. The Obama-era complaint alleged that the company had discriminated against \u201cqualified\u201d blacks, Asians, and women in \u201cproduct development roles\u201d by paying them less than their white counterparts. The Obama-era DOL also claimed Oracle discriminated against blacks, Hispanics, and whites in favor of Asian applicants in two other positions, meaning that Oracle had allegedly discriminated against and in favor of Asians. One\u00a0Wall Street Journal op-ed wondered why President Donald Trump\u2019s Labor Secretary, Alexander Acosta, \u201cwould continue his predecessor\u2019s depredations that seek to dictate how businesses manage their workforces and rewrite civil-rights and labor law according to the left\u2019s identity politics.\u201d Now Eugune Scalia is running the DOL he could have the opportunity to the Obama-era lawsuit against Oracle. \u201cIt is apparent that neither Solicitor of Labor Kate O\u2019Scannlain nor OFCCP Director Craig Leen is prepared to move back to a system where merits trump optics,\u201d Glueck said. \u201cOracle brings this suit because the leadership at the Department of Labor has failed to restore balance to an unrestrained bureaucracy.\u201d \u201cWe believe strongly in maintaining a level playing field in the workplace for all our employees and remain proud of our firm commitment to equality in our workforce. This lawsuit seeks to ensure that employers such as Oracle are likewise entitled to a level playing field when the government asserts claims of discrimination,\u201d he added. \u201cThis has not been the case with the OFCCP, resulting in enforcement actions that are meritless and defamatory to Oracle, its executives, and other government contractors,\u201d Glueck concluded in his statement.
