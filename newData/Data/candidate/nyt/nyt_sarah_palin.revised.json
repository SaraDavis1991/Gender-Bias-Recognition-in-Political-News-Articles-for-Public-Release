      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 IT\u2019S a tough call to figure out which place is more benighted: Hollywood or Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia was pulling ahead with all its beheadings and its top cleric\u2019s fatwa on chess as \u201cthe work of Satan.\u201d But then Hollywood took the lead with its Jim Crow Oscars, Scully being offered half of Mulder\u2019s pay for the \u201cX-Files\u201d reboot, and its second-class treatment of Rey \u2014 the scrappy heroine of \u201cStar Wars: The Force Awakens.\u201d Rey, played by Daisy Ridley, embodies the awakening Force. Yet even the director, J.J. Abrams, called it \u201cpreposterous and wrong\u201d that Rey\u2019s action figure was missing in action from some game and toy tie-ins \u2014 a traditionally male realm. And Lucasfilm is run by a girl action figure, Kathleen Kennedy, so go figure. That is why it\u2019s so inspiring to see a woman out on the campaign trail who has had such a historic impact on feminism, helping to recast outmoded assumptions about women. Yes, Sarah Palin, I\u2019m giving you a shout-out. Before Palin, if a woman flamed out in a spectacular fashion, it was considered an X through the X chromosome. If Billie Jean King lost to Bobby Riggs, women would be seen as second-class athletes. If Geraldine Ferraro seemed unfit for the White House, all women might be judged incapable. But when Palin turned out to be utterly unqualified and unintelligible, spouting her own special Yoda-like language, it did not reflect poorly on women as a whole \u2014 only on her and John McCain. What the hell were you thinking, Senator? Ordinarily, it\u2019s considered sexist to call a woman shrill. But Palin liberated us on that score. She really is shrill. Ordinarily, it\u2019s dicey to focus on what a woman in politics is wearing. But again, Palin has freed us up. She sported a cardigan so gaudy and rogue at her Iowa endorsement of Donald Trump (the man who viciously mocked her former running mate\u2019s war record) that we would be remiss not to mention that it was the sartorial reflection of Palin and Trump themselves. Ordinarily, you have to tread gingerly in critiquing a working woman on her mothering skills. But Palin\u2019s brawling brood runs so wild around the state she once governed, in a way that is so contrary to her evangelistic, sanctimonious homilies on family values, that it seems only Christian to advise her to study the Obamas to see what exceptional parenting looks like. With Palin and Trump, a failed reality star and a successful one, gall is divided into two parts. There has been a lot of talk this campaign season about how women pols bring superior qualities to the table: collegiality and listening skills. But Sarahcuda shows that we are truly the equals of men, capable of narcissistic explosions, brazen hypocrisy and unapologetic greed. She had barely finished the endorsement Tuesday when she began using it to raise money for SarahPAC, so she can take her show on the road. Her oldest son, Track, was a kid with a temper before he served in Iraq for a year, conveniently shipping off in the fall of 2008 as his mother began her hockey-mom spiel. The 26-year-old was arrested Monday  on an assault charge, accused of punching his girlfriend in the face and kicking her during an alcohol-fueled argument at the Palins\u2019 home in Wasilla, Alaska. His girlfriend told the police that he was also waving around an AR-15 assault rifle. Instead of just admitting that her family is a mess, Palin exhibited Trump-like swagger, conjuring a story in an attempt to gin up the crowd and occlude her son\u2019s behavior. She used the last refuge of scoundrels in Tulsa, Okla., Wednesday, wrapping herself in patriotism. In her convoluted, disingenuous way, she charged President Obama with a lack of \u201crespect\u201d for veterans and suggested that Track had post-traumatic stress disorder and became \u201chardened,\u201d implying this is what led to the incident prompting his arrest. This from the archconservative who presents herself as a model of personal responsibility and scourge of victimhood? Outraged vets urged Palin not to reduce PTSD to a political \u201cchew toy,\u201d as one put it, or to excuse domestic violence by citing the disorder. The rattlebrained Palin has reversed her Iraq position, so that now her stance somehow matches Trump\u2019s consistent and prescient one against the Iraq invasion. When she saw Track off to Iraq in 2008, she echoed W.\u2019s specious argument, calling the war a \u201crighteous cause\u201d to avenge \u201cthe enemies who planned and carried out\u201d 9/11. But in her endorsement of Trump, she praised Rand Paul, who thinks we should have left Saddam Hussein in place, and argued that America should stop \u201cfootin\u2019 the bill\u201d for oil-rich nations and \u201ctheir squirmishes that have been going on for centuries, where they\u2019re fightin\u2019 each other and yellin\u2019 \u2018Allah akbar,\u2019 calling jihad on each other\u2019s heads for ever and ever.\u201d Hillary Clinton is presenting herself as the embodiment of women, an American Marianne, pushing her gender in an all-for-one-one-for-all, now-or-never way. She\u2019s even campaigning this week in Iowa with Billie Jean King. Women should support her because if she founders, it will be bad for women. One Democratic senator said privately that many Democrats believe that Hillary is still the presumed nominee only because she is a woman. But Palin has done us a favor by proving that a woman can stumble, babble incoherently on stage and spew snide garbage, and it isn\u2019t a blot on the female copybook. It\u2019s all on her. Can I get a hallelujah?",

      "content": " WASILLA, Alaska \u2014 People here in Sarah Palin's hometown learned science from her father. They remember how she led the Warriors to an unexpected high school basketball championship, her success as a beauty queen and how her family grew along with the Wasilla Bible Church. So when Palin, then a young mother, ran for the City Council in 1992, of course they voted for her. And they kept doing so, for mayor and then for governor \u2014 especially the women who, like her, had small children, hated abortion and prayed every day. \"I admire her intelligence and I admire her integrity, but first and foremost she's a mom, and she has an understanding of what being a mom is,\" said Janet Kincaid, a grandmother and Republican who last summer opened her lakeside Wasilla home for a $20,000 Palin fund-raiser. As Palin, a first-term Republican governor, sampled the curried tuna puffs and gave her speech, Kincaid recalled, even the woman who cleans Kincaid's house decided to give money. Although some liberal Democrats dismiss them as \"Palinbots\" for their reflexive devotion, these women are as dedicated to Palin as the women Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democrat of New York, called her sisterhood of the traveling pantsuits were to their very different version of the modern female politician. These are women who dip in and out of the work force, believe in prayer and spend their days trying to keep the crayon off the walls. They feel they have been looked down on by Clinton feminists and ignored by the power structure in the Republican Party. The fact that Palin has five children, including Trig, a newborn with Down syndrome, only makes her that much more part of the sisterhood. \"I'm not that into politics,\" said Delores Field, an Alaska Inupiat from Eagle River, near Anchorage, who does not consider herself a Democrat or a Republican. \"I'm just going to vote for Trig Van Palin's mom.\" This segment of Palin's supporters are not the women of Phyllis Schlafly's deeply conservative generation of Republican women, nor are they the polished women who might have enjoyed lunch with the first lady, Laura Bush, in her Texas days. Like many women in the valley where Palin comes from, her appeal here, and in recent days across the country, is more about who she is \u2014 that is, a devout Christian with a husband who supports her career, but a person who is not afraid to show up in public with a baby on her hip. \"She didn't create this, but she showed up at the right time,\" said Darla Shine, whose Happy Housewife Club franchise includes a talk radio show, a book and a Web site that receives millions of hits a month. \"She represents a huge pocket of women who have been the ignored community for so long.\" Although strong opposition to abortion and an evangelical approach to Christianity are often shared traits among the Palin women, they do not necessarily walk lock step with Republican politics, said Serrin Foster, president of Feminists for Life, a lobbying group with 28,000 members, including Palin. Some of the group's members are vegans who might not appreciate Palin's penchant for hunting moose. Others might consider themselves moderates who could vote for either party. \"There is a spectrum within the pro-life movement,\" Foster said, \"and Sarah is proof that you can be pro-life and pro-woman.\" Rick Mystrom, a Republican who was the mayor of Anchorage when Palin was Wasilla's mayor, said other women in Alaska who are politicians, like Senator Lisa Murkowski, also a Republican, are seen differently, as part of the Alaska political machine. ( Murkowski supports abortion rights.) \"Sarah's appeal,\" Mystrom said, \"is that she is everywoman and she became what every woman thinks she can become.\" Palin's evangelical Christian beliefs were an asset in this conservative state, and they also helped propel her to the Republican ticket as Senator John McCain's running mate. She is part of a generation of Christian women who began serving on school boards and small governmental bodies in the 1990s, and often look out for one another. When she bucked her party and then ran against the Republican governor in 2006, she did not get much support from the traditional channels. So Republican women's clubs around the state came through by raising tens of thousands of dollars for her campaign. Palin's political career has grown along with her church, which began with a few families and recently moved to a new building that seats 400 and hosts three services on Sunday. Steve Menard, a member of the church who is running for Wasilla mayor next month, said that although the church helped Palin's rise, a political climate ready for someone like her was helping her national profile. \"You needed the right candidate at the right time,\" Menard said, \"to open doors for working women who share a set of values.\" Her ability to mix church, family and politics is part of the draw. Through connections with other longtime family friends, including political allies and members of her church, she was able to raise the sales tax in Wasilla as a way to help finance a $15 million sports complex that featured a new hockey rink for her son Track to play on. This summer, several Christian groups came together for a day of prayer at the arena. Palin was there with her infant Trig in her arms and a daughter, Piper, nearby. Some of Palin's critics say that her popularity, to a degree, is superficial. Mike Doogan, who for 14 years was a columnist with The Anchorage Daily News before he became a Democratic state legislator, said he understood her appeal to a certain type of female voter. But Doogan said her image was carefully cultivated to do just that. \"There is no more unlikely hockey mom on this planet,\" he said. \"They are usually not this politically ambitious or cut-throat.\" Anne Kilkenny, who said she voted for Palin in city elections, said she became disillusioned with her after participating in Wasilla city government and seeing Palin up close. \"You've got to remember,\" Kilkenny said, \"we are not much bigger than a high school and she is the homecoming queen.\" None of that matters for the women who see Palin's rise as their rise. \"Sarah Palin is a different kind of feminist,\" said Joy Ng, who lives in Kodiak with her husband of 35 years. \"She is a strong woman who can wear a skirt and be proud of it.\"",

      "content": " DONALD J. TRUMP has made a shrewd bet. For the first time since he descended an escalator in Trump Tower last June to announce that this time, he really was running for president, he ceded control of his campaign message. He handed the Trump-bedecked podium over to Sarah Palin. Mr. Trump\u2019s bet: When the politician most fluent in American rage roars, the movement she gave voice to in the fall of 2008 will roar back today. With his call to deport illegal immigrants, especially because Mexico sends us its \u201cbad ones,\u201d his proposal to bar Muslims from entering the country, his emphasis on the threats to lawful gun ownership and his promise to protect American goods and workers from China, Mr. Trump is riding the wave of anxiety that Ms. Palin first gave voice to as Senator John McCain\u2019s running mate. Mr. Trump has now usurped and vastly expanded upon Ms. Palin\u2019s constituency, but the connection between the two movements is undeniable. As a senior adviser to the McCain-Palin campaign in 2008, I understand why, to this day, Senator McCain remains gracious toward Ms. Palin. Despite her shortcomings, she brought out the largest crowds that we\u2019d seen since the campaign started. Voters stood for hours on the rope line to meet her. Her legacy lies in her innate ability to wrap herself in the anger that those voters felt. While Senator McCain seemed slightly unnerved by the intensity of their discontent, Ms. Palin basked in it. I stood backstage at a rally in Minnesota in October 2008 where Senator McCain took the microphone from a woman in the crowd who spoke about her fears, including that Barack Obama was \u201can Arab.\u201d Senator McCain said, \u201cNo, ma\u2019am,\u201d and explained that Mr. Obama was a good and decent family man and an American with whom he simply disagreed on policy matters. This interaction will go down as one of the finest moments from one of the country\u2019s finest men. But it was also an early warning that the Republican base was profoundly agitated. To some in the news media, voter anger seems like a new phenomenon. But they attended the same Palin rallies I did \u2014 we all should have seen this coming. The Alaska governor whipped the crowds into a frenzy with her fiery attacks on the media and the establishment politicians that she had gleefully upended in the Alaska statehouse. When her rallygoers shouted crude comments from the stands, as the woman at the Minnesota rally had done, there was no confrontation between Ms. Palin and the offender. When the press started to report on the angry rhetoric coming from those Palin crowds, I remember Senator McCain\u2019s concern. The growing furor in the Republican Party was something that we, as a campaign, failed to address, but to the crowds, Sarah Palin proved the more satisfying politician on the ticket because of it. Ms. Palin owned the resentment voters in the Republican Party. They became her cause. And when the campaign concluded, she became the poster politician for the Tea Party movement. She was its first star, and hers became a coveted endorsement. Ms. Palin typically picks candidates who are trying to unseat incumbents and more experienced politicians, an ironic development considering that she was selected as a running mate to reinforce Mr. McCain\u2019s brand as a \u201cmaverick\u201d \u2014 but a maverick who worked within the Senate and the Republican Party. She has now turned the institutions in which he has proudly served into liabilities for the candidates running against her mama-grizzly-approved outsiders. The party bears some responsibility for her success. Our base has grown increasingly exasperated with Washington Republicans who, despite historic victories in the midterm elections of 2010 and 2014, seem incapable of reversing President Obama\u2019s legislative agenda or asserting themselves in the country\u2019s foreign policy debates. Ms. Palin has amassed a decent record of success by endorsing conservative stars like Gov. Nikki Haley of South Carolina, Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa and Ted Cruz, of Texas, in his Senate bid. But no endorsement returned her to the spotlight like this embrace of Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump improves upon Ms. Palin\u2019s jagged attempts at a post-2008 message with a vision for reclaiming American greatness by promising better trade deals, improved care for veterans, a more successful foreign policy based on his personal strength and immigration reform that is based mostly on building a wall. His proposals are, at best, vague and of questionable legal soundness, but they\u2019ve propelled his candidacy by inflaming voter concern that America has lost ground. That he would refine and recalibrate his proclamations in a general election or as president is a widely held assumption among the Republican establishment. It\u2019s possible that this is the kind of false comfort that people on a sinking ship murmur to one another about how death by drowning really isn\u2019t a bad way to go. We\u2019ll never know if Sarah Palin would have taken her turn atop the polls at any point during this year\u2019s Republican primary if she\u2019d decided to run. Her inclusion may be the only thing that could have made it more extraordinary. During Ms. Palin\u2019s 37-minute score settling-slash-endorsement address last week, Mr. Trump seemed, at times, uncomfortable and eager for her to wrap things up. Should he come out on top in Iowa, he has her to thank.",

      "content": " IT\u2019S hard to know exactly what impact Sarah Palin\u2019s endorsement of Donald J. Trump has had on his campaign. We do know, however, that the sparkly Milly beaded silk bolero jacket she wore while giving her speech sold out soon after, despite its $695 price tag. But several style experts slammed her choice as inappropriate, and on Twitter a marketing executive likened her to a \u201cdisco ball hedgehog.\u201d Women in the public eye walk a perilous line. Last month, President Obama told Politico that he admired Hillary Clinton for the fact that when she was campaigning against him, she had to do everything he had to do but \u201clike Ginger Rogers, backwards in heels.\u201d She even had to wake up earlier than he did, the president said, \u201cbecause she had to get her hair done.\u201d And now she may yet compete against Mr. Trump, a former owner of the Miss Universe pageant, who poked fun at Carly Fiorina\u2019s face and asked, \u201cWould anyone vote for that?\u201d In Mr. Trump\u2019s spiteful eye, even Angelina Jolie is unattractive and Heidi Klum is \u201cno longer a 10.\u201d Which is ridiculous, coming from a man who is no longer young and has a peculiar hairstyle. Why, then, does the lens through which we view and judge prominent people still remain more magnified, harsh and unforgiving for women than for men? Take, for example, an incident during the run-up to the 2008 presidential election, when I was a senior editor at Newsweek. We were given about 15 minutes to snap Senator John McCain and his running mate, whose identity was at that time a guarded secret: The photo of Mr. McCain and Ms. Palin ran on the cover of our Sept. 8 issue, devoted to the Republican convention. Two months later, we ran a cover story on Ms. Palin with the tag line \u201cShe\u2019s One of the Folks.\u201d The editor in charge of covers, Bruce Ramsay, said he wanted a more intimate portrait, so we used a closely cropped version of the earlier image. A female staffer noticed that the crop revealed some untended lip and eyebrow hair, but Mr. Ramsay decided to go ahead with the image unaltered, for several reasons. The magazine had a policy of not retouching photos, and Mr. Ramsay wanted the strong eye contact in the image; in any case, the facial hair was barely noticeable. Once it hit the newsstands, though, conservative commentators fumed, accusing Newsweek of trying to damage Ms. Palin. One Republican media consultant called the cover \u201cmortifying,\u201d \u201ca clear slap in the face.\u201d The image \u201chighlights every imperfection,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking unwanted facial hair, pores, wrinkles.\u201d A media business analyst decried it as an insult. \u201cHere\u2019s your beauty queen,\u201d he wrote. Ms. Palin was \u201cyour \u2018hottest governor from the coldest state.\u2019 How do you like her now that you\u2019ve seen her crows\u2019 feet, her clumpy mascara, her bloodshot eyes, her faint mustache, her cakey makeup, her gaping pores etc?\u201d In short, Newsweek was accused of sexism because we did not airbrush the photo. The truth was, we\u2019d portrayed Ms. Palin just the way we did male candidates. \u201cWhat was most interesting about the episode is that Newsweek (and probably other media) typically shot men and women differently for news covers,\u201d says Mark Miller, who was Newsweek\u2019s assistant managing editor in 2008. \u201cSo when the photographer and crew set up for the August shoot, the lighting was created in anticipation of a male candidate. It was, for lack of a better word, harsher than we would have used for a woman. \u201cIn effect, we had typically \u2018man lighting\u2019 and \u2018female lighting\u2019 \u2014 and they weren\u2019t the same. Also, because our editorial policy was not to alter news photos, we generally did not use close-up images of women on the cover because of the potential for an unflattering image.\u201d Bizarre, isn\u2019t it? As Mr. Miller points out: \u201cClose-up photos of men are used all the time without being touched up \u2014 men, particularly our political leaders, are expected to have lines and wrinkles. In fact, the cragginess of a man\u2019s face is thought to express character.\u201d The incident reveals fascinating fault lines in the way we view public figures: Why do women need to be perfect? What do we expect from our political leaders? Why can we portray men in close-up and not women? Why are male blemishes signs of authority while women\u2019s are signs of shame? And why, in particular, do we stigmatize female facial hair so savagely? As Victorian literature reveals, women have long sported mustaches, and were not always judged so sorely for it. When Tess rides away with Alec in Thomas Hardy\u2019s \u201cTess of the D\u2019Urbervilles,\u201d a character\u2019s mother laughs while \u201cstroking her mustache.\u201d In Victoria Cross\u2019s 1903 novel \u201cSix Chapters of a Man\u2019s Life,\u201d the heroine has a mustache \u201cso perceptible that you can see it all across the room.\u201d The male narrator is charmed: \u201cIt would spoil most women I know, but it doesn\u2019t seem to spoil her.\u201d The lead character in Albert W. Aiken\u2019s 1895 dime novel \u201cThe Female Barber Detective,\u201d Mignon Lawrence, confesses to her landlady that \u201cif I didn\u2019t shave I would have a regular mustache, and as a woman can\u2019t very well go to a barber I am compelled to shave myself.\u201d In \u201cThe Woman in White,\u201d the character Marian Halcombe is described as having \u201cdark down on her upper lip\u201d that \u201cwas almost a mustache.\u201d Yet when Wilkie Collins\u2019s 1859 story was adapted as a musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber in 2004, this aspect of her appearance was ignored so that the audience would not be \u201cdistracted\u201d by her facial hair. Why do we consider a mere hint of the hirsute such a disgrace for women when men can mooch about our cities with goatees, mutton-chop whiskers, navel-skimming beards and even \u201cman buns\u201d with little comment? We think of ourselves as liberated, yet it is still considered embarrassing and shameful for a woman\u2019s upper lip to be imperfectly depilated. I could not care less whether someone waxes, trims, bleaches or zaps \u2014 I\u2019m not volunteering to become a champion of hirsutism. Mightier ladies than I may blaze that path. The real question here is about perfection: the standards by which women are judged, and the seemingly ever-present, imposed need to airbrush the images of women. Even vice-presidential candidates. This is something we must ask if we want to shrink the too-long list of things that distract people from what women actually say when we try to speak in public.",

      "content": " Sarah Palin\u2019s defamation lawsuit against The New York Times Company was reinstated by a federal appellate court on Tuesday, with a three-judge panel ruling that a District Court judge was wrong to dismiss it two years ago. The case involves an editorial The New York Times published in June 2017. Ms. Palin, the former vice presidential candidate, argued in her lawsuit that the editorial had incorrectly linked her to a 2011 mass shooting in which Gabrielle Giffords, then a congresswoman from Arizona, was severely wounded. Ms. Palin\u2019s political action committee had previously circulated a map of electoral districts, some with cross hairs on them, and she said The Times had connected the map to the shooting despite knowing that tie to be false. The Times later issued a correction, saying there was no link between that political rhetoric and the shooting. In August, Judge Jed S. Rakoff of Federal District Court in Manhattan dismissed the suit after an unusual evidentiary hearing in which James Bennet, the editor of the Times editorial page, testified. He said he had not intended to blame Ms. Palin for the shooting of Ms. Giffords, but rather to make a broader statement about the country\u2019s heated political environment. Mr. Bennet inserted the statements that Ms. Palin said were defamatory during the editing process. On Tuesday, a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that it was not for a judge to determine whether Mr. Bennet had acted out of \u201cactual malice,\u201d meaning that he either knew that what he wrote was false or that he acted with \u201creckless disregard.\u201d The judges said that in light of Mr. Bennet\u2019s testimony, Ms. Palin\u2019s case remained \u201cplausible.\u201d \u201cThis is \u2014 and has always been \u2014 a case about media accountability,\u201d Libby Locke and Ken Turkel, lawyers for Ms. Palin, said in a statement on Tuesday. \u201cWe are pleased with the court\u2019s decision, and we look forward to starting discovery and ultimately proceeding to trial.\u201d Eileen Murphy, a spokeswoman for The Times, said, \u201cWe are disappointed in the decision and intend to continue to defend the action vigorously.\u201d",
