      "content": " IOWA CITY \u2014 Oliver Hanlon was beaming ear-to-ear as he stood next to Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts on a riverside stage at the University of Iowa. \u201cI met the president,\u201d he shouted, bounding down the steps two at a time. His mother gently corrected him: \u201cNot yet,\u201d she said, while the Warren photo line snaked on behind her. Oliver couldn\u2019t be faulted for his civics proficiency; he\u2019s 7 years old. The 2020 Democratic presidential campaign stops are crawling with children, some of whom spend most of the stump speeches crawling away from their parents. While all of the candidates seek to portray a family-friendly image, it takes work to bring a youngster to a campaign event: They often start late and run well into the evening, with a policy discussion not exactly accessible on the elementary-school level; bigger rallies often take place outdoors, regardless of weather. Kissing babies and tousling children\u2019s hair has long been a staple of retail campaigning, but in 2020 it is about more than a photo op, even the cutest of photo ops. In a historically crowded field, in an era of uncertain polling, these campaign stops are something of a past-their-bedtimes straw poll, revealing which candidates young parents deem viable or famous enough to risk a tantrum or a sleep-deprived meltdown over the next morning. For now, the leaders appear to be Ms. Warren and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who have both taken steps to cater to the children and parents who come see them. It\u2019s one more subtle measure of their stature in a race that is steadily narrowing from the largest primary field in history to just a handful of viable contenders. Ms. Warren and Mr. Biden, whose staffs both go to great lengths to present their events as family friendly, are currently atop the Democratic polls, which might explain the pep talk parents often give their children before meeting the two candidates: You are talking to the next president. Ms. Warren lets families with children cut to the front of her selfie line, a strong incentive given that supporters often wait hours for a 20-second interaction and photograph. Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign stops over the summer and fall have often come with free ice cream \u2014 and if frozen dairy products are not available, he\u2019s been known to hand out cash with instructions for children to tell their parents to stop for a treat on the way home. During a Labor Day swing through Iowa, Mr. Biden worked a chocolate-and-vanilla swirl machine at one union picnic and handed out ice cream sandwiches at another. Last month in Iowa City, Clara Engler, 5, spent hours before an evening Warren rally at the University of Iowa practicing the \u201cpinkie promise\u201d that has become a staple for young girls at Ms. Warren\u2019s events. With her mother, Brooke Engler, an Iowa City cosmetologist, Clara worked on locking fingers briefly and looking up, so she could hear Ms. Warren tell her that running for president is \u201cwhat girls do.\u201d When the moment came, about a half-hour after Clara\u2019s bedtime, Ms. Warren got down on one knee, looked her in the eye and made the promise. Clara jumped up with glee. Her mother beamed. \u201cShe\u2019d seen it before on TV,\u201d Ms. Engler said. \u201cIt\u2019s nice that I can have my child sit back and watch politics without worrying about what will be said.\u201d The others in the 19-candidate Democratic field aren\u2019t overtly inhospitable to children, but former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas peppers his stump speech with profanity and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont isn\u2019t a fuzzy figure while delivering his policy-heavy stemwinders. In early September he scolded a crying baby to \u201ckeep it down\u201d during a campaign stop in New Hampshire. Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., whose most fervent supporters tend to be young enough not to have children of their own, often attracts older kids \u2014 particularly L.G.B.T. teens inspired by the first openly gay major candidate for president. \u201cWhen you know that there\u2019s something historic about your campaign, you feel a level of responsibility that goes with that,\u201d Mr. Buttigieg said aboard his Iowa campaign bus last month. \u201cIt certainly adds a level of motivation when people come up to you, sometimes with tears in their eyes, just letting you know what the fact of your campaign means to them.\u201d Even in Iowa, where rare is the weekend without a presidential hopeful stumping nearby, it takes a serious commitment and coordination to attend a campaign event with young children. \u201cIf she starts crying we\u2019ll run out quickly,\u201d Elizabeth Batey, a lawyer from Waverly, Iowa, said of her 2-year-old daughter, Hattie, while waiting for Mr. Buttigieg last month in a stuffy storefront in Iowa Falls. Ms. Batey, whose 4-month-old son, George, was asleep in his car seat, made it through Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s event without having to flee. Afterward, she waited on the sidewalk in front of the Buttigieg campaign bus, holding one child in each arm. \u201cWow, you\u2019ve got your hands full,\u201d Mr. Buttigieg told her before pausing for a picture. Parents interviewed at a range of campaign events said they often felt like this political moment resembled a tawdry reality TV show, and they brought their children to see the 2020 candidates to try to demonstrate to them that politics can be something different. \u201cI can\u2019t let my kids listen to the TV without being ready to hit the mute button,\u201d said Julia Privett, a physician assistant who brought her 2-year-old daughter, Alyssa, to see Mr. Biden talk about climate change in Cedar Rapids. Lytishya Borglum, a Cedar Falls small business owner, brought her three middle-school-aged children to see Senator Kamala Harris of California speak at the University of Northern Iowa. She\u2019d taken her oldest daughter, 13-year-old Berlyn, to see Democratic caucus campaign events in 2008, but skipped 2016 because it was too toxic. \u201cNowadays, it\u2019s impossible for them not to be exposed to the craziness in the White House,\u201d Ms. Borglum said. At Ms. Warren\u2019s Iowa City rally, a parade of children waited with their parents for a picture with the senator. Kohner Reynolds, who will turn 2 in November, blew past his 7:30 p.m. bedtime. \u201cHe fell asleep a couple times in the baby carrier,\u201d said Kohner\u2019s mother, Callie Reynolds. \u201cI wanted him to be able to say he came to see her.\u201d Burgundy Johnson, a child psychologist, kept her 5-month-old son, Archer, up past his 8 o\u2019clock bedtime. She occupied Archer with toys. \u201cI wanted a picture of Elizabeth Warren holding my baby,\u201d she said while leaving the event at 8:40 p.m. \u201cNow it\u2019s going to be an interesting night.\u201d The older children tend to be more attuned to issues. Evelynn Parlet, 11, an Iowa City sixth grader, said she approved of Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign goal of reordering the American economy. \u201cI liked what she said,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to help people who don\u2019t have enough money.\u201d Samara and Isa Murillo, sisters who are 10 and 8 years old, each had Ms. Warren autograph a white campaign placard. Ms. Warren got down on one knee and signed them on the floor of the stage. \u201cWe love her ideas about change and the two cents,\u201d Samara said. \u201cPeople out there are dying of hunger.\u201d Isa said she was more focused on climate change. \u201cSome people don\u2019t have homes because of the flooding,\u201d she said. And, because it is Iowa, there are parents who spend caucus season vying to get their children photographed with all of the candidates they can \u2014 just in case one of them makes it to the White House. Eric Heininger, a fund-raiser for nonprofit organizations, and his wife, Tiffani Milless, a physician, toted their 9-month-old daughter, Charlotte, around the Polk County Steak Fry last month to get her in pictures with as many contenders as possible. Dressed in a red-white-and-blue sundress, Charlotte met Ms. Warren, Mr. Buttigieg, Mr. O\u2019Rourke and the entrepreneur Andrew Yang. At earlier campaign events, she was photographed with Mr. Sanders, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey and former Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado, who ended his campaign in August. With Charlotte sleeping on her father\u2019s chest, Dr. Milless filled out a card committing to caucus for Mr. O\u2019Rourke and held it up while the Texan offered his toothy smile. \u201cThank you so much,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke said, gently patting the sleeping child on her back. A campaign aide took Dr. Milless\u2019s caucus card and stuffed it into a backpack. Afterward, Dr. Milless said she had only filled out the card in order to secure the picture with her daughter. \u201cHe\u2019s in my top three,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a loose commitment, kind of like a promise ring.\u201d",

      "author": "Lisa Lerer",
      "content": " For months, Senator Bernie Sanders brushed off questions about his age, offering a simple, six-word mantra to those who doubt he\u2019s energetic enough to run for president: \u201cFollow me around the campaign trail.\u201d But in the hours before the chest pains that led to an emergency procedure in a Las Vegas hospital, Mr. Sanders, 78, uttered a different, perhaps more telling, series of six words. \u201cGet me a chair up here,\u201d he said, turning to his deputy campaign manager on Tuesday, before sitting down in front of the crowd of 250 gathered for a fund-raiser in a Persian restaurant. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long day here.\u201d For months, Democrats have watched as a trio of septuagenarians commanded a majority of support in their crowded primary field: Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., 76, Senator Elizabeth Warren, 70, and Mr. Sanders, have consistently led in the contest to face President Trump, 73, next year. Presidential campaigns always reflect the hopes and fears \u2014 or, as political strategists call them, the \u201ckitchen table conversations\u201d \u2014 of the voters who cast the ballots. And this year, along with health care costs and college affordability, stagnant wages and immigration, the contest also reflects another issue, one that strikes at the heart of a country where the highest share of the electorate will be older than 65 since at least 1970: How old is too old? Voters, who have watched candidates through debate stages and state party dinners, on sweaty stages and speed-walking across the state fair, corn dog in hand, do not generally want to say there is a ceiling. No one is too old to be doing this. They just are not sure they would want to be keeping up such a rigorous schedule in their 70s. Would you? Gerontologists and other experts in aging say there is simply no way to definitively address the question of an upper age limit on the rigors of the presidency. \u201cThere\u2019s no answer. It\u2019s unknowable,\u201d said Dr. Mark Lachs, co-chief of Geriatric and Palliative Medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian. \u201cIt\u2019s true that rates of physical and cognitive impairment are age dependent but there\u2019s all kind of variability.\u201d The averages paint a sobering picture: The average life expectancy in the United States is just under 79, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Even as Americans live longer than ever before, about 85 percent of older adults have at least one chronic disease, and more than three-quarters have at least two. But despite the statistics, one person\u2019s 70 can be another\u2019s 60, Dr. Lachs said. And being 70 years old, he added, is not at all what it used to be. \u201cThe yardstick gets moved every decade because the country is aging and medical care becomes better,\u201d he said. \u201cAge should not be a disqualification for the presidency.\u201d That\u2019s a message some voters happily believe, as they confront the realities of aging in their own lives. The number of Americans who plan to retire after age 66 has steadily ticked up over the past quarter century, with a quarter saying they do not plan to retire at all. \u201cSeventy is the new fifty,\u201d said Halliestine Zimmerman, a retired accountant from Greenville, S.C., who celebrated her 70th birthday in June, a week before Ms. Warren did. \u201cYou don\u2019t really think I am at the end of my life span, you think more you are in the middle. I know what it is I want out of my life, and you know how to get it.\u201d Ms. Zimmerman\u2019s husband, whose age she would only give as \u201c70 plus,\u201d had a triple bypass several years ago and today he regularly plays tennis. \u201cHe\u2019s doing fantastic, so a stent doesn\u2019t bother me at all,\u201d she said, of Mr. Sanders. \u201cI don\u2019t think he will stop campaigning, I don\u2019t think he should \u2014 remember a lot of people don\u2019t make it to his age.\u201d But others worry that an older commander-in-chief would share the declines they have experienced in their own physical and mental abilities over the years. Discussions of aging have been all-but-inescapable on the campaign trail. Since he entered the race, Mr. Biden has been dogged by questions about his physical fitness and condition \u2014 concerns he has tried to alleviate by bounding through parade routes and shaking dozens of hands in steamy summer weather. Mr. Sanders keeps a blistering campaign schedule that often includes multiple events in multiple cities each day. And supporters of Ms. Warren gush about her vitality, bragging about the hundreds of selfies she takes with supporters after each appearance. \u201cI was just amazed that when you first came out here, Senator Warren, that you ran up those steps the way that you did, and all this energy and stamina that you have,\u201d Nikita L. Jackson, a Rock Hill, S.C., city councilwoman, said as she praised Ms. Warren to a crowd at a town hall event on Saturday. None of the Democratic candidates have been particularly eager to delve into the details of their health. Aides to Mr. Sanders released a brief statement noting that he \u201cwas found to have a blockage in one artery and two stents were successfully inserted,\u201d a fairly common procedure in the United States. Like his rivals, Mr. Sanders has not yet released his medical records, though all three have vowed to do so before the Iowa caucuses in February. With little actual medical information, even minor irregularities in how candidates appear have prompted a flurry of age-related speculation. When Mr. Sanders hit his head on the edge of a glass shower door, his campaign explained that he had received a cut requiring stitches but stressed that he did not fall. Mr. Biden appeared to be moving his mouth in a strange fashion during the last debate, which led to questions about whether he wore dentures. At Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign events, voters question whether his verbal missteps can be attributed to his age. \u201cHe\u2019s not as sharp as he might be,\u201d said Carol Sobelson, 63, at a campaign event in Concord, N.H. \u201cHe\u2019s done a lot for our country, he was a great vice president. He\u2019s probably not my first choice.\u201d Health, or the perception of a candidate\u2019s health, is unlikely to be off the table in a campaign against Mr. Trump. In 2016, his supporters spliced together video footage of Hillary Clinton coughing and Mr. Trump often questioned her stamina, particularly after she abruptly left a ceremony in New York honoring the 15th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks. Already, Mr. Trump has started questioning Mr. Biden\u2019s energy levels, nicknaming him \u201cSleepy Joe.\u201d Nearly all Democrats prefer candidates in their 40s through 60s, according to surveys. When asked about the ideal age for a president, just 3 percent said the 70s, according to polling released by Pew Research Center in May. Other polls have shown that Americans express more discomfort with a candidate in their 70s than one who is gay, Muslim or an independent. The two Democratic nominees who have won the White House since 1992 \u2014 Bill Clinton and Barack Obama \u2014 made generational change a key part of their winning campaign message. Both were the youngest in their primary fields.",

      "subtitle": "In the last three months, Bernie Sanders raised $25.3 million. Pete Buttigieg raised $19.1 million and Kamala Harris $11.6 million, at a time when donations signal viability.",
      "author": "Shane Goldmacher",
      "content": " Senator Bernie Sanders has produced the biggest fund-raising quarter of the Democratic primary, as his campaign announced on Tuesday that he had taken in $25.3 million over the last three months. Now the big questions looming over the donor race are whether Senator Elizabeth Warren will surpass him, and whether former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. will trail far behind. Mr. Sanders\u2019s third quarter haul is the latest demonstration of the rising power of small donors to reshape presidential politics. His campaign moved swiftly on Tuesday to assert his financial might, reserving his first television ads of the campaign \u2014 a two-week, $1.3 million buy in Iowa. Yet President Trump displayed fund-raising might that far surpassed any of the Democrats. Republican Party officials said that his re-election campaign and the Republican National Committee had raised $125 million over the last three months, a presidential fund-raising record. Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren have yet to share their much-anticipated totals. But Ms. Warren\u2019s figure is prompting much speculation; she is widely expected to improve upon the $19 million that she raised last quarter as she has surged in the polls to become Mr. Biden\u2019s leading rival. The expectations game is perhaps most fraught for Mr. Biden, whose efforts to fashion himself as the clear front-runner mean that any slippage from the top of the ranks represents a risk. Both Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders have boycotted the big-money circuit, raising the possibility of a watershed moment: The two top fund-raisers in the Democratic Party might end up being candidates who have turned their backs on the established class of political bundlers and financiers who have held sway for decades. The third quarter is known as perhaps the toughest to raise money in, as big donors are often out of town vacationing in July and August while small contributors spend less time online in the summer. But the money totals are critical not only to set budgets, hire staff and run ads but also because they mark the last time in 2019 that campaigns must open their books, hardening public perception of viability \u2014 or lack of it \u2014 during a crucial three-month period. The quarter ended on Monday and campaigns have until Oct. 15 to share their financial figures. Those without enough money can be winnowed quickly from the field; a half-dozen Democratic candidates have already called it quits this year. \u201cIt dictates the narrative in the lead-up to the elections,\u201d said Rufus Gifford, who served as finance director for President Barack Obama\u2019s re-election campaign and has donated to multiple 2020 candidates. \u201cThe big game that\u2019s going on inside the campaigns is how to manage expectations.\u201d The string of fund-raising announcements began early Tuesday morning with Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., who announced that he had raised $19.1 million in the third quarter. It was a dip from the field-leading $24.9 million he posted in the previous quarter, but more than enough to fully fund his once-upstart campaign into this fall and winter. Mr. Buttigieg has developed a grass-roots following, pairing his 580,000 donors with an aggressive calendar of dozens of traditional fund-raising events. Senator Kamala Harris announced an $11.6 million haul \u2014 nearly matching her totals in the first two quarters. She was the only campaign to announce her cash on hand: nearly $10 million, down from $13.3 million at the end of June, meaning she spent more than she raised in the last three months. Mr. Biden raised $22 million in the last quarter, second to Mr. Buttigieg. But there are signs his fund-raising operation has slowed, particularly online, where Mr. Biden has slashed his advertising budget. While Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders did not have to fill their calendars with fund-raisers, Mr. Biden raced across the country in the last three months, from Florida to California, Aspen to the Hamptons, holding more than 40 donor events. His wife, Dr. Jill Biden, headlined another dozen. This weekend, top Biden donors and bundlers have been invited to a retreat in Philadelphia to discuss the campaign\u2019s next phase. Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign has said he scored his best week of fund-raising since the second week of the campaign as Democrats initiated an impeachment inquiry of Mr. Trump over a whistle-blower complaint claiming that Mr. Trump prodded the president of Ukraine to investigate the business dealings there of Mr. Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden. Still, some Biden supporters are nervous about how the impeachment process, and any added scrutiny of Hunter Biden\u2019s business affairs, will play out. Some have even discussed creating a super PAC, which the campaign quickly disavowed. Others see in Ms. Warren\u2019s rise as a top rival, with Mr. Sanders in third, an opportunity for Mr. Biden to truly consolidate a donor class that has remained fractured. Mr. Biden\u2019s ability to attract small donors will be closely scrutinized. In the last 90 days, his campaign ranked 10th among the Democratic presidential candidates for advertising dollars on Facebook, where campaigns often prospect for new contributors. He spent less than one-quarter of what Mr. Buttigieg had spent on the platform in that time, and well less than half of what Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders had spent, according to Facebook data. Mr. Biden told donors at a sushi restaurant in Los Angeles last week that he had nearly 670,000 donations overall with an average donation of $46, which would translate to only about $10.8 million this quarter. A Biden campaign official said the former vice president had not presented the \u201cfull picture\u201d but declined to elaborate. A Biden campaign official said Tuesday that the former vice president had \u201cunequivocally\u2019\u2019 raised enough money to be competitive in the primary race, and that details would be released soon. [Sign up for our politics newsletter and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race.] Steve Westly, a bundler for Mr. Biden in California, said that skeptics and critics place too much importance on any one measurement of Mr. Biden\u2019s candidacy. \u201cEvery time someone is a front-runner, they say, \u2018Oh my gosh, they\u2019re not ahead in every straw poll, ahead in every state and every fund-raising report,\u2019\u201d Mr. Westly said. \u201cThe reality is you want to be in first place, which is where Joe Biden is.\u201d Harold Schaitberger, a close Biden ally and president of the International Association of Fire Fighters, which has endorsed Mr. Biden, compared the race to a schoolyard game of \u201cking of the hill.\u201d \u201cIf you\u2019re the king and you\u2019re on the hill, everybody else \u2014 in this case certainly within the Democratic candidates and the Republican Party \u2014 are doing everything they can to take you off the hill,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the point of it.\u201d He said he had \u201cseen no indication of any concern\u201d about resources. For Mr. Sanders, his $25.3 million quarter \u2014 which included his second biggest day for fund-raising of the campaign, on Monday \u2014 was a welcome reprieve from weeks of questions about his pathway as he has stagnated in the polls and has been passed on the left by Ms. Warren. (In one Iowa poll, more of those who caucused with Mr. Sanders in 2016 said they planned to support Ms. Warren in 2020 than him.) \u201cMedia elites and professional pundits have tried repeatedly to dismiss this campaign,\u201d said Faiz Shakir, Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign manager, \u201cand yet working-class Americans keep saying loudly and clearly that they want a political revolution.\u201d For Mr. Buttigieg, the third quarter was a period of rapid expansion: He went from zero field offices in the early states to 42, and his staff jumped to 400 people. Mr. Buttigieg, who began the year as a little-known mayor, has raised more than $51 million for the year, a remarkable sum for a newcomer to the national scene. But he has struggled to translate that cash into support beyond single digits in the polls. While Ms. Harris\u2019s haul was similar to her previous quarters, she entered October on a far different trajectory. She began the quarter riding high from her June debate performance \u2014 raising $4 million in the last four days of that month \u2014 but had faded by late September, promising to refocus on Iowa amid a staff shake-up.  One other campaign announced its numbers Tuesday: Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey raised more than $6 million, his best quarter yet. Ten days ago, in a gambit to draw attention and donations, Mr. Booker\u2019s campaign said he would quit the race if he did not collect at least $1.7 million; he raised more than $2.1 million. The quarterly fund-raising report will be the first for Beto O\u2019Rourke, the former Texas representative, since the shooting in his hometown of El Paso that appeared to give his candidacy fresh purpose. Andrew Yang, the New York executive running a web-savvy campaign centered on the idea of giving away $1,000 to every American every month, is expected to post by far his best haul of the campaign.",

      "content": " With a crucial debate looming next week in the Democratic presidential primary, the party\u2019s populist wing appears increasingly in control of the race \u2014 rising in the polls, stocked with cash and with only a wounded leading candidate, Joseph R. Biden Jr., standing in its way. Several slow-building trends have converged to upend the race over the last few weeks: Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s steady ascent in the polls has accelerated. Both she and Senator Bernie Sanders, a fellow progressive, have raised immense sums of money from small donors online, dominating the Democratic field and each collecting about $10 million more than Mr. Biden in the last quarter. And Mr. Biden\u2019s numbers have gradually slipped in a way that has alarmed his supporters. The race is far from over: All three of the top candidates \u2014 Ms. Warren, Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders \u2014 have a path to victory, and there is still time for longer-shot candidates to make a real run at the nomination. The CNN/New York Times debate in Ohio on Tuesday is likely to test Ms. Warren\u2019s status as an emerging front-runner, subjecting her to new criticism from her fellow Democrats on matters ranging from health care policy to trade and the role of the government in overseeing the economy. Above all, she may need to allay lingering reservations about her appeal to swing voters in the general election. And Mr. Biden signaled on Thursday night that he will come into the debate fighting. \u201cOne of the problems I\u2019m finding, I\u2019ve got to be more aggressive,\u201d he said at a fund-raiser in Los Angeles. He then used a roundabout example to explain that debate time restraints don\u2019t allow time for lengthy answers. \u201cWhen someone says, you know, you know, \u2018Are you still beating your wife?\u2019 And, and I go, \u2018I have a long explanation,\u2019 and they say, \u2018You got 30 seconds to answer.\u2019 And you say, \u2018No. And then, wait a minute, what\u2019d I just say? No, I\u2019m not still beating my wife.\u2019 But so, I\u2019ve had, I\u2019ve had some difficulties,\u201d he said. If Tuesday\u2019s debate could break in any number of directions, what may be resolved is the overall mood of Democratic primary voters, and whether they are more inclined to seek a politically cautious nominee who promises to restore normalcy in Washington, or a more confrontational standard-bearer with an ambitious and disruptive reform agenda. It is candidates in the latter category who now control the bulk of the financial might in the race, and are best positioned in most of the early primary states. Anna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster who is not aligned in the primary, said an \u201canti-establishment\u201d current had plainly taken hold, with voters rewarding candidates for defying the conventional limits of political debate and \u201cpushing boundaries in really productive ways.\u201d She pointed not only to Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders but also to former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke, who has embraced a new political identity for himself as a gun-control activist and a critic of his own party\u2019s relatively cautious platform on the issue. \u201cAcross the board, whether it\u2019s Beto talking about assault weapons or Warren and Sanders talking about Wall Street,\u201d Ms. Greenberg said, \u201cit does feel like there is a shift in the party that is kind of new.\u201d Ms. Greenberg said there was still space for Mr. Biden to run a strong campaign because of the way voters perceive his values and character. Americans, she said, believe Mr. Biden \u201ccares about people and working class people, regular people, and that\u2019s not an insignificant asset.\u201d Yet it has been Ms. Warren, rather than Mr. Biden, who has consistently gained strength. Campaigning on a message of purging corruption in Washington and restructuring the economy, Ms. Warren has closed Mr. Biden\u2019s lead in the polls every week since the beginning of the summer and is now in a position to upset him in both Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two states to vote. Mr. Biden remains a strong contender for the nomination, largely because of the support he collects from African-American voters. But he has struggled for months to articulate a clear vision for the future and has relied heavily on Democratic nostalgia for the Obama administration. In recent weeks, he has been consumed in a grisly political clash with President Trump. So far, the support Mr. Biden has lost does not seem to have gone to another moderate, like Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. Only Ms. Warren has been moving up in the national polls, suggesting either that Mr. Biden\u2019s lost supporters have defected to her camp or that they have become undecided altogether. If Ms. Warren has become the leading liberal standard-bearer, Mr. Sanders has been a steady third in national polls and his fund-raising power is likely to keep him among the most formidable competitors in the race. Yet his campaign has been grappling with the implications of Mr. Sanders\u2019s heart attack in Las Vegas last week, a medical emergency that landed him in the hospital and has kept him off the trail for days. He has sent mixed signals about his path forward, first indicating that he would scale back his campaign schedule and then defiantly reversing that suggestion. It is unclear whether Mr. Sanders\u2019s physical condition will affect his poll numbers: He has a solid base of support nationally and few other candidates believe his core followers will be easily dislodged. There is at least a new degree of uncertainty about whether he will be in a strong position to vie for liberal Democrats who have already been migrating toward Ms. Warren. Nearly all of the candidates feel pressure to do something in the Ohio debate to stop the race from becoming a contest entirely defined by a Warren-Biden rivalry, either by inflicting direct damage on Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign or by outflanking her as an alternative to Mr. Biden. The ongoing impeachment inquiry targeting Mr. Trump has only added to the pressure on the Democratic field, since the tumult in Washington is likely to leave voters with even less time to devote to reviewing underdog options. Mr. Buttigieg in particular has been moving assertively in recent weeks to position himself as a center-left alternative to both Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren, using his considerable war chest to run television ads in Iowa. Several other candidates of different ideological stripes are counting on Iowa for a breakthrough, including Senators Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Amy Klobuchar. A wild-card joining them onstage will be a new contender, Tom Steyer, a former hedge fund investor who has spent lavishly from his personal fortune to brand himself as a reform-minded outsider. For Ms. Warren, meanwhile, the debate may help reveal whether she can consolidate her gains across the Democratic Party. On Wednesday, she campaigned in South Carolina, where she has so far struggled to gain traction with the African-American voters who largely decide the primary there. To cement her status as a front-runner, she may have to win over a range of constituencies torn between their interest in her ideas and a more cautious political calculus that draws them to Mr. Biden. One of those voters is Ohio\u2019s former governor, Ted Strickland, the only Democrat to hold that office this century. Like many Democratic voters, Mr. Strickland, a populist with close ties to organized labor, said he saw Mr. Biden as the safer bet for the general election but found it hard to resist the appeal of Ms. Warren\u2019s proposals, most of all her plan for a new tax on vast private fortunes. \u201cI think there may be something to the electability issue for Mr. Biden, in Ohio,\u201d Mr. Strickland said. \u201cBut if I could just choose to put someone in the presidency \u2014 if that was my choice alone \u2014 it would be hard for me to pass up Elizabeth Warren.\u201d Mr. Strickland said he had spoken with Mr. Biden recently and saw him as a seasoned diplomat and a reliable \u201ceconomic progressive.\u201d But Ms. Warren, he said, was gradually easing voters\u2019 reservations about her ability to go up against Mr. Trump by talking about policy issues \u201cin ways that are easily understood.\u201d Mr. Biden remains a clear favorite in just one of the early states, South Carolina, and his advisers have predicted that he would fare better in larger, more diverse states that vote later in the calendar. He is counting, in particular, on older and more moderate African-American voters to hold back the party from stampeding toward a more ideological liberal candidate. In 2016, black and Latino voters helped Hillary Clinton withstand a persistent primary challenge from Mr. Sanders. Yet scattered polling in the later states has largely followed the national trend: Last week, for instance, the Public Policy Institute of California released a poll finding a statistical three-way tie in the nation\u2019s most populous state between Mr. Biden, Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders. Mark Baldassare, president of the institute, said there was no indication in his poll that the state\u2019s diversity would represent a stumbling block for candidates on the left, as Mr. Biden is hoping. The primary debates would be crucial to determining Ms. Warren\u2019s continued momentum, he said, because voters seemed to be using them for insight into the general election. \u201cIt has become kind of a proxy for: How are these candidates going to do when they stand up next to Trump?\u201d Mr. Baldassare said. \u201cI think this will be Elizabeth Warren\u2019s moment now, because if she is in the mix for front-runner, people are going to be testing her and seeing: How does she do? How does she do when she has to be on defense?\u201d",

      "author": "Maggie Astor",
      "content": "  Here\u2019s our rundown of what happened in the Democratic primary this week, as the candidates gear up for Tuesday\u2019s debate in Ohio. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. explicitly endorsed impeachment on Wednesday, going beyond past statements in which he had called only for an impeachment inquiry if President Trump did not cooperate with Congress. \u201cTo preserve our Constitution, our democracy, our basic integrity, he should be impeached,\u201d Mr. Biden told supporters in New Hampshire, as he accused Mr. Trump of having \u201cbetrayed this nation.\u201d It\u2019s been a whirlwind week for Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who is recovering from a heart attack. In addition to the concerns the episode raised about his health, his campaign\u2019s delay in disclosing the heart attack led to criticism about its transparency, which Mr. Sanders has forcefully rejected. Perhaps more consequentially, Mr. Sanders told reporters on Tuesday that he would be changing the \u201cnature\u201d of his campaign by doing fewer events. On Wednesday, he said he had misspoken. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts often tells voters that after she became \u201cvisibly pregnant\u201d at the end of her first year as a public-school teacher, the principal wished her luck and hired someone else to replace her. This week, a conservative news site and other outlets challenged her account, citing a 2007 interview with Ms. Warren and minutes from a school board meeting \u2014 and Ms. Warren pushed back in a unique way. Rather than just restating the truth of her account (though she has done that as well), she called on women to share their own stories of pregnancy discrimination, which remains widespread. CNN and the Human Rights Campaign hosted the latest subject-based forum of the presidential race on Thursday, focused on gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender issues. Protesters interrupted the event at several points to call attention to the murders of black transgender women, and the candidates seemed to welcome the reminder. Before the event, Ms. Warren, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and Senator Kamala Harris of California released plans on L.G.B.T.Q. equality. All three said they would fight to pass the Equality Act and ban conversion therapy as president. This week brought a deluge of new policy proposals on issues ranging from foster care to judicial ethics. The fifth presidential debate will be held in Georgia on Wednesday, Nov. 20, and the hosts will be MSNBC and The Washington Post. As previously announced, candidates will need 165,000 donors and at least 3 percent support in four qualifying polls to make the stage. (An alternative polling option is 5 percent support in two early-state polls.) Eight candidates have met those criteria so far; the latest was Andrew Yang, who did so this past week. Ms. Warren had a crowd-pleasing comeback at the CNN town hall when asked how she would respond to a supporter who said, \u201cSenator, I\u2019m old-fashioned, and my faith teaches me that marriage is between one man and one woman.\u201d Read more about the moment here.",

      "author": "Matt Stevens",
      "content": " Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont proposed a new corporate tax on Monday that would penalize some of the country\u2019s largest companies if they did not narrow the gap between what they pay their chief executives and what they pay their workers. The proposal is the latest measure from Mr. Sanders aimed at reducing income inequality \u2014 a pillar of his campaign for the Democratic nomination for president. It is also the latest example of the commitment by Mr. Sanders and his leading progressive rival, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, to use America\u2019s tax system to address the wide gulf between ordinary Americans and the rich. \u201cThe American people are sick and tired of corporate C.E.O.s who now make 300 times more than their average employees, while they give themselves huge bonuses and cut back on the health care and pension benefits of their employees,\u201d Mr. Sanders said in a statement. \u201cThey want corporations to invest in their workers, not just dividends, stock buybacks and outrageous compensation packages to their executives.\u201d Mr. Sanders\u2019s proposal would impose tax rate increases on companies whose chief executives make at least 50 times what their typical workers earn. The tax would apply to all private and publicly held corporations with annual revenue of more than $100 million, the Sanders campaign said. The tax penalties would begin at half a percentage point for companies that compensate their highest-paid employees between 50 and 100 times as much as their typical workers, then escalate as the pay gap increases. The biggest penalty \u2014 5 percentage points \u2014 would apply to companies that pay their top executives more than 500 times what they pay a typical worker. Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign said that if current pay patterns continued, the plan would raise about $150 billion over the next decade; the revenue would be used to pay for a plan he released earlier this month to eliminate an estimated $81 billion in existing medical debt. He followed that three days later by proposing an annual tax on the fortunes of the richest Americans, an idea that Ms. Warren has made a centerpiece of her presidential bid. The tax plans the two candidates have proposed would need to be passed by Congress to become law, an unlikely scenario if Republicans retain control of the Senate. Together, Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders have used the 2020 Democratic primary to offer up a substantial rethinking of the federal government\u2019s approach to taxation that would shift more of the burden of paying for government toward the wealthy. \u201cAt a time of massive income and wealth inequality, the American people are demanding that large, profitable corporations pay their fair share of taxes,\u201d Mr. Sanders said in his statement on his corporate tax proposal. \u201cIt is time to send a message to corporate America: If you do not end your greed and corruption, we will end it for you.\u201d Ms. Warren also wants to change how the country\u2019s most profitable corporations are taxed in order to ensure that they are paying their \u201cfair share.\u201d In April, she proposed a new tax on corporations that report more than $100 million in profits. Ms. Warren has another proposal about big corporations, the Accountable Capitalism Act, that addresses executive compensation. The proposal would restrict when top executives can sell company shares, and it would require that workers elect at least 40 percent of a company\u2019s board of directors.",

      "author": "Peter Suderman",
      "content": " It was in Vermont that Senator Bernie Sanders learned to love single-payer health care \u2014 what he now calls Medicare for All \u2014 and it was in Vermont that American single-payer faced its greatest test so far. Under Gov. Pete Shumlin, a Democrat and avowed supporter of single-payer health care, the state worked to create a groundbreaking plan, called Green Mountain Care, to cover all its citizens. Following the Affordable Care Act\u2019s 2010 passage, state lawmakers enacted legislation intended to put Vermont \u201con a path to a single-payer system.\u201d No state-based single-payer effort ever made it as far, and Mr. Shumlin positioned the plan as a test case for the nation. Yet despite strong support from the legislature and the governor\u2019s office, not to mention Mr. Sanders himself, the effort failed. That failure demonstrates why any similar project undertaken at a national scale is unlikely to succeed as well. In fact, it is the strongest argument against Mr. Sanders\u2019s single-payer plan. The first problem for any single-payer push would be political support: Mr. Shumlin campaigned on a promise to build a single-payer system in Vermont, but the public never quite bought in. An April 2014 survey showed 40 percent support, 39 percent opposition and 21 percent undecided \u2014 a lukewarm result for such a major undertaking. That year, Mr. Shumlin barely won the popular vote against an anti-single-payer Republican. As John E. McDonough of Harvard wrote in a perceptive New England Journal of Medicine analysis of the plan\u2019s collapse, \u201ca clear public mandate\u201d for Mr. Shumlin\u2019s health care agenda \u201cwas nowhere in evidence.\u201d One reason the plan lacked strong support was lawmakers were cagey about how to pay for it. The 2011 proposal included no specific financing mechanism, because Mr. Shumlin\u2019s team worried that might kill its chances. Initial cost estimates were far too optimistic. A 2011 study led by William Hsiao of Harvard found that single-payer could reduce state health care spending by 8 percent to 12 percent immediately and more in later years, resulting in about $2 billion in savings over a decade. But by the time Mr. Shumlin ditched the plan, internal government estimates showed a five-year savings of just 1.6 percent. The reduced savings were partially a result of several decisions, made under political pressure, to expand the offered benefits by paying for a larger share of an individual\u2019s average costs and covering out-of-state workers. Lower savings, in turn, meant higher tax rates. Initial estimates foresaw that businesses would have to pay additional taxes equal to 9.4 percent of payroll, and families would pay a little more than 3 percent of income, supposedly costing a typical household $370 less per year overall. Yet by 2014, Mr. Shumlin\u2019s own estimates found that employers would have to pay taxes equal to about 11.5 percent of payroll, while families would have to pay as much as 9.5 percent of their annual income to make the financing work. The plan would have nearly doubled the size of the state\u2019s budget. For both political and economic reasons, the cost was deemed too high. There were other complications: Public outreach was weak. And in 2013, the state started an online insurance exchange under the Affordable Care Act that was plagued by technical failures, which the state struggled to fix. As the Cornell Policy Review noted in a 2017 post-mortem, the mix of higher-than-expected costs and administrative problems \u201cfostered an atmosphere of uncertainty and distrust in the state government, turning a politically steep climb into a politically insurmountable one.\u201d And so, at the end of 2014, Mr. Shumlin admitted defeat. \u201cI have learned that the limitations of state-based financing, the limitations of federal law, the limitations of our tax capacity and the sensitivity of our economy\u201d make single-payer \u201cunwise and untenable at this time,\u201d he said. \u201cThe risk of economic shock is too high.\u201d The Vermont plan was done in by high taxes, distrust of government and lack of political support. Any effort by a Sanders administration to enact a single-payer system at a national level would probably be doomed by similar problems. Like Mr. Shumlin, Mr. Sanders is a devout single-payer supporter who has campaigned aggressively on the idea. And like Mr. Shumlin, Mr. Sanders has so far declined to lay out a plan for fully financing his Medicare for All system. But while some polls show majority public support for single-payer, that support declines substantially when faced with trade-offs like the elimination of most private coverage or higher taxes \u2014 two components of Mr. Sanders\u2019s plan. Similarly, Medicare for All supporters argue that single-payer would reduce the nation\u2019s overall health spending. But savings are heavily predicated on the assumption that the new government-run system could pay Medicare rates, which are typically lower than those of private insurance, to providers across the board. Legislators in Washington State started with the same assumption when they attempted to design a state-managed insurance plan, and it proved wrong. The plan passed only once rates were increased. Yet even a plan with lower rates would still represent an enormous increase in total government spending. A Sanders presidency would have to overcome a deep trust deficit born of both lingering frustrations with Obamacare and the generalized cynicism and ineptitude of the Trump administration and the current Congress. And unlike Mr. Shumlin, Mr. Sanders would be faced with both a public and a legislature that is not nearly as friendly as in left-leaning Vermont. Even if Democrats somehow took both chambers of Congress, influential Democrats in the Senate, where legislative details would be hashed out, are still wary of pursuing a full-fledged single-payer system. It\u2019s true, of course, that there are differences between state and federal budgeting, and true that the president has political clout no state governor could ever hope to match. But if it couldn\u2019t work in Vermont, with a determined governor, an accommodating legislature and progressive voters, Mr. Sanders will have a tough time explaining why it will somehow succeed on a vastly larger scale. Vermont represents a practical failure on friendly turf, and that is what makes it such a powerful counter to Mr. Sanders\u2019s proposal. \u201cIf Vermont can pass a strong single-payer system and show it works well, it will not only be enormously important to this state, it will be a model,\u201d Mr. Sanders said in 2013. As it turns out, it was a model. But instead of showing us how it would work, it showed us why it would fail.",

      "author": "Thomas Kaplan",
      "content": " LOS ANGELES \u2014 With Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s announcement on Friday that she raised $24.6 million in the past three months, the fund-raising picture for the leading Democratic presidential contenders has come into focus: Ms. Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders are in strong position to fund their campaigns over the long haul. Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders, whose campaign announced raising $25.3 million in the third quarter, both brought in more money than they had in the previous quarter, while money totals were down for two of their top competitors, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. Ms. Warren\u2019s total also offers further evidence of her steady rise to the top of the pack in the Democratic primary race, where she now rivals Mr. Biden as a leading contender for the nomination. And while Mr. Sanders trails both of them in recent polls, he has a loyal following that has supported him with millions of small donations this year, ensuring that he is well positioned for a primary season that could stretch through next spring. More broadly, the fund-raising totals show the collective enthusiasm in the party for progressive candidates pushing messages of sweeping change. And they demonstrate the undeniable power of online donors in the primary. Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders have sworn off courting wealthy donors and holding elite fund-raising events, while Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg \u2014 who raised $15.2 million and $19.1 million in the quarter, according to their campaigns \u2014 both pursue money from big donors. The fund-raising hauls by Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren show that there is \u201cstrength and power to their ideas that they\u2019re putting forward, and people are engaged,\u201d said Karen Finney, a Democratic strategist who was a senior adviser for Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign. \u201cI think for anybody else in the race, you have to pay attention to that \u2014 that there is energy around some of these big ideas that represent bigger changes,\u201d she said. Mr. Biden\u2019s total did little to bolster his status in the race. Already under siege from President Trump and no longer enjoying a clear lead over the rest of the field in national polls, Mr. Biden saw his fund-raising drop roughly 30 percent from the previous quarter. Mr. Sanders exceeded Mr. Biden\u2019s total by about $10 million and Ms. Warren exceeded it by more than $9 million \u2014 an indicator of the gulf between Mr. Biden and his two progressive rivals in attracting grass-roots support. And for the second consecutive quarter, Mr. Biden, a two-term vice president who previously served in the Senate for 36 years, was bested by Mr. Buttigieg, the mayor of the fourth most populous city in the 17th most populous state. Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign said on Friday that it had received 943,000 donations in the third quarter from 509,000 donors, and more than 300,000 of those donors gave to her presidential campaign for the first time. The average donation was $26, and Ms. Warren ended the quarter with $25.7 million in cash on hand, according to her campaign. \u201cPlease take a moment to be proud of the movement you\u2019re helping build,\u201d Roger Lau, Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign manager, wrote in an email to supporters. \u201cClose your eyes and picture Wall Street bankers scowling into their catered breakfast,\u201d he suggested. Collecting small contributions from a vast group of donors comes with a huge long-term advantage: Those donors can keep giving again and again as the campaign goes on. That is not the case for wealthy donors writing $2,800 checks to candidates \u2014 the maximum an individual can give to a campaign for the primary race. Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders \u201care breaking these old political models in which rich donors can capture and control political parties,\u201d said Stephanie Taylor, a co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which is supporting Ms. Warren. \u201cThis is just a really revolutionary, seismic shift in American politics.\u201d Beating Mr. Sanders\u2019s total for the past three months would have given another jolt of momentum to Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign. Instead, Mr. Sanders\u2019s status as the top fund-raiser for the quarter provides a reminder of his sizable base of support, even as other indicators like polling are less favorable. In the long run, Mr. Sanders\u2019s slight financial edge over Ms. Warren in the quarter is unlikely to make a major difference in the perceptions of their candidacies. Mr. Sanders entered the race having already established an enormous network of donors during his 2016 presidential campaign, and he raised slightly less in the third quarter of 2019 than he did during the same time period in 2015. \u201cThe biggest takeaway is that Warren is on a roll,\u201d said Stephanie Cutter, a Democratic strategist and veteran of past presidential campaigns. \u201cShe\u2019s got wind at her back. It\u2019s evident in her polls, her fund-raising and the energy at her events.\u201d Among other candidates who have disclosed their fund-raising for the third quarter, Senator Kamala Harris raised $11.6 million, Andrew Yang raised more than $10 million and Senator Cory Booker raised more than $6 million, according to their campaigns. Presidential candidates must report their fund-raising for the quarter, which covered July through September, to the Federal Election Commission by Oct. 15. Ms. Warren struggled with fund-raising at the beginning of her campaign, but those struggles ended up being short-lived. Her third-quarter haul is another validation of her strategy to rely on online donors to finance her campaign. That choice is central to her bid for the presidency, freeing up her schedule and creating a tidy contrast with some of her rivals: While other candidates gather with rich donors, Ms. Warren spends hours taking pictures with voters who wait in the \u201cselfie line\u201d at her town-hall-style events. \u201cI made the decision early on I was not going to spend my time behind closed doors with corporate executives and bazillionaires,\u201d Ms. Warren told the crowd at a town hall in Carson City, Nev., on Wednesday night. \u201cI was going to spend my time here.\u201d At a town hall in San Diego on Thursday night, she reached her latest selfie-related milestone: She has now taken pictures with an estimated 70,000 people since beginning her campaign. She made it to the end of the selfie line just before midnight.",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 \u201cNone of us know when a medical emergency will affect us,\u201d Senator Bernie Sanders wrote in a tweet from Desert Springs Hospital Medical Center on Wednesday, hours after the 78-year-old Democratic candidate for president experienced one. Mr. Sanders\u2019s emergency \u2014 the sudden onset of chest pain known as angina \u2014 is one that thousands of other Americans experience each year. Mr. Sanders\u2019s discomfort occurred at a campaign event on Tuesday night. Because it signaled acute heart trouble, the senator went to the hospital where doctors implanted two stents in one of the coronary arteries that nourish the heart. Doctors often release patients who undergo such procedures in a day or two. Mr. Sanders remained in the hospital until Friday evening, when \u2014 after three days of revealing few details about his condition \u2014 his campaign confirmed that Mr. Sanders had suffered a heart attack. Until then, Mr. Sanders had not disclosed whether blood and electrocardiogram tests showed he had a heart attack. The senator and his campaign have not allowed reporters to interview his doctors, though advisers have said that Mr. Sanders would be able to appear in the next Democratic debate on Oct. 15. With respect to release of health information, President Trump has not had a medical emergency while running for or serving in office, but he disclosed few specific laboratory test results initially in his 2016 campaign. He issued a four-paragraph letter from his personal physician stating that Mr. Trump would be \u201cthe healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.\u201d Closer to the 2016 election date, Mr. Trump\u2019s doctor offered a more conventional letter that still omitted a number of details that would be part of a customary summary of a patient\u2019s health. In 2018, the doctor, Harold N. Bornstein, said that Trump aides had raided his office a year earlier and taken the president\u2019s medical files after The Times reported that the president had taken a drug for hair growth. And this year, the White House physician pronounced Mr. Trump in \u201cvery good health\u201d although the president had gained weight and is now officially obese. The health questions hang over Mr. Sanders in part because he would become the nation\u2019s oldest president by far if elected. Also, given that implanting two stents in one coronary artery is a very common procedure in American hospitals, it was puzzling that for several days he did not release more details. Mr. Sanders is a private person, no doubt, but most modern-day presidents and serious candidates for the presidency have put forward details to inform the electorate after emergency health issues. Normally, \u201crecovery from stent placement is very quick,\u201d and patients usually go home a day or two after the procedure, said Dr. Jonathan S. Reiner, a cardiologist at George Washington University Hospital in Washington, D.C. who treated former Vice President Dick Cheney for serious heart disease for many years before, during and after his two terms of office. Dr. Reiner is not involved in Mr. Sanders\u2019s care. Older patients and those who experience complications like heart rhythm abnormalities, heart attacks or heart failure may remain in the hospital longer. A patient\u2019s condition usually determines the length of stay. In the 2016 presidential campaign, Mr. Sanders\u2019s doctor said that the senator was \u201cin overall very good health.\u201d His ailments included gout; a mild elevation of cholesterol; an inflammation of out-pouches in the bowel known as diverticulitis; and hormone replacement therapy for an underactive thyroid gland. He had no reported history of heart disease. Tuesday\u2019s episode of angina appears to be his first such incident. In cases like Mr. Sanders\u2019s, doctors perform a standard procedure known as cardiac catheterization. In it, they thread thin tubes into chambers of the heart and inject a radio-opaque dye to produce X-rays outlining the coronary arteries. For Mr. Sanders, the procedure revealed blockage in one artery; he has not said which artery. Doctors would then remove the blockage, which is usually caused by deposits of fatty substances, by inflating a tiny balloon in a tube to squash them. Implanting the stents aims at preventing development of scar tissue and recurrence of the blockage. All presidential hopefuls strive to portray themselves in good health. When a medical event occurs, candidates and their aides, who usually have had little if any medical knowledge, often scurry to play it down to prevent damage to the leader\u2019s image. Mr. Sanders\u2019s event is likely to renew pressure on his rivals to release their health information in a timely fashion. Although some have made pledges, they have not done so. In recent years, most candidates have released their personal health information in statements from their doctors or through interviews. The practice grew out of retrospective analyses of the health of presidents that document how some presidents hid or lied about their health problems, often aided by their doctors. Occasionally, White House doctors have misdiagnosed a president\u2019s heart and vascular problems. Experts believe that President Warren Harding died of a heart attack that his doctor did not detect. Toward the end of President Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s third term and until his death in his fourth term, his White House doctor withheld the fact that he had serious heart failure. President Dwight D. Eisenhower suffered a heart attack near the end of his first term. Examination of his older medical records has provided strong clues that he had a heart attack before he ran for president. In 1999, former Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey damaged his presidential campaign by not disclosing that he had a number of episodes of atrial fibrillation (a heart rhythm abnormality) before he experienced one while campaigning and had to rush to a hospital in the Bay Area with reporters trailing him. Among the current candidates, Joseph R. Biden Jr. underwent emergency surgery in 1988 for a near-fatal ruptured berry aneurysm of an artery in his brain. He also underwent surgery to remove a second berry aneurysm. New cerebral aneurysms can develop years later in a tiny percentage of individuals who have survived one. In 2008, Mr. Biden\u2019s doctor said that he had recovered fully, and that he did not need further tests to detect a new berry aneurysm because he had done well for 20 years. Modern medicine has enabled many individuals with heart disease and other chronic ailments to successfully run for office and fulfill their duties. Nevertheless, Mr. Sanders\u2019s stent episode is likely to renew a measure of voter interest in the health of its 2020 presidential candidates. Two other leading Democratic hopefuls are in their 70s and President Trump is 73. All of them, as well as Mr. Sanders, may well be medically fit to serve, but Americans have never faced the prospects or consequences of so many top candidates who were past the official retirement age.",

      "content": " BURLINGTON, Vt. \u2014 In July 1987, Bernie Sanders, then the mayor of Burlington, Vt., arrived in Ottawa convinced he was about to see the future of health care. Years earlier, as his mother\u2019s health declined and his family struggled to pay for medical treatment, he was spending more time attending to her than in classes at Brooklyn College, suffering through what his brother called \u201ca wrecked year\u2019\u2019 leading to her death. Over time, he had come to believe that the American health care system was flawed and inherently unfair. In Canada, he wanted to observe firsthand the government-backed, universal model that he strongly suspected was better. Amid tours of community centers and meetings with health care providers, Mr. Sanders more than liked what he saw. \u201cHe was thrilled,\u201d recalled Beth Mintz, a professor of sociology at the University of Vermont and a member of a task force that accompanied Mr. Sanders. \u201cIt gave him much more confidence in the possibility of the single-payer system as a solution.\u201d Decades before \u201cMedicare for all\u201d would propel his presidential campaigns, Mr. Sanders\u2019s expedition to Ottawa helped forge his determination to transform the American health care system. His views burst onto the national political scene during his 2016 presidential run, when he championed a single-payer program alongside many other liberal policy ideas. Now, as he seeks the Democratic presidential nomination for a second time, he has made \u201cMedicare for all\u201d the most important issue of his campaign and set the agenda for the ideological discussion in the primary. Health care dominated the first two Democratic debates this summer and will most likely be  prominent again during the third debate on Thursday in Houston. Other candidates support \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d but it is Mr. Sanders who has become singularly identified with it \u2014 \u201cI wrote the damn bill!\u2019\u2019 he proclaimed in July\u2019s debate. A review of hundreds of pages of documents from the first chapters of his political career \u2014 including speeches, correspondences and newspaper clippings \u2014 as well as interviews with those who have known him throughout his life, show that while his democratic socialist worldview underpins his \u201cMedicare for all\u201d pitch, he was also guided by other factors. Chief among them were his mother\u2019s illness and death, which instilled in him the desire  to ensure everyone had access to medical care, and the adjacency of Vermont to Canada, which afforded him a blueprint for universal health care. Together, they help explain why he has staked not only his campaign, but also much of his political legacy, on promoting \u201cMedicare for all.\u2019\u2019 \u201cYou can\u2019t overstate the impact that Vermont\u2019s proximity to Canada had on Bernie\u2019s thinking about how to approach reforming the American health care system,\u201d said Jeff Weaver, who has worked with Mr. Sanders since the 1980s and remains one of his closest advisers. The pull of Canada remains strong: In July, Mr. Sanders took a bus trip from Detroit to Windsor, Ontario, with diabetes patients to highlight lower drug prices in Canada. In an interview on Sunday, Mr. Sanders described how seeing the Canadian system up close significantly shaped his own views on health care. \u201cIt was kind of mind blowing to realize that the country 50 miles away from where I live \u2014 that people could go to the doctor whenever they wanted and not have to take out their wallet,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was just a profound lesson that I learned,\u201d he said. He also criticized the American system as \u201cbarbaric.\u201d And he vowed \u2014 as he often does in his stump speeches \u2014 \u201cto take on the greed and the corruption of the health care industry.\u201d  Mr. Sanders\u2019s health care proposal has attracted legions of supporters fed up with the rising costs of the current system, and it sets him apart from more centrist candidates like Joseph R. Biden Jr. But his uncompromising position also threatens to alienate voters who are pleased with the Affordable Care Act, or who do not want to give up their private insurance. His own state of Vermont so far does not have a single-payer program. Despite skepticism about his views, however, Mr. Sanders has consistently resolved to reform the health care system, even before being elected to public office. In 1972, when he was running for Senate as a candidate from Vermont\u2019s left-wing Liberty Union Party, The Bennington Banner, a local newspaper, reported him taking an uncompromising stance: \u201cThere is absolutely no rational reason, in the United States of America today, we could not have full and total free medical care for all.\u201d The first seeds of Mr. Sanders\u2019s concern were sown in Brooklyn. A high-school track and cross country star with an emerging political streak, Mr. Sanders had wanted to go to Harvard, friends said. But by his senior year, his mother, Dorothy Sanders, had become sick, her heart damaged from having rheumatic fever as a child. As her health declined, her illness consumed him. He stopped going to track practice. To be closer to her, he began his freshman year at Brooklyn College. Mr. Sanders describes his family as lower middle class. His father, an immigrant from Poland, was a paint salesman. He has said his parents frequently argued about money. When his mother fell ill, his family moved her into a charity hospital in New Jersey. After a failed heart surgery, she died in March 1960, when she was in her mid-40s. \u201cBernard actually spent much more time with her than he did in class,\u2019\u2019 his brother, Larry, recalled in an interview in February. \u201cIt was really a kind of wrecked year and a very unhappy year.\u201d Then, as now, Mr. Sanders avoided speaking of his mother\u2019s death. On Sunday, he declined to discuss his personal life, but said that his family had \u201cstruggled economically, and that\u2019s it.\u201d In a 2006 interview with Vermont PBS, he offered a glimpse into how her illness shaped his thinking. \u201cWhen you talk about money and family, how do you get the money for the medical treatment that my mother needed?\u201d he said. \u201cI won\u2019t go into the whole long song and dance of it. But trust me, it was something that I also have not forgotten about \u2014 the right of people to have health care, which was a little bit difficult in our family situation.\u201d  It would still be some years, though, before health care became his political hallmark. Mr. Sanders transferred to the University of Chicago, where he spent hours in the library reading progressive publications that would influence his political views. There, he turned his energy toward civil rights. \u201cWe didn\u2019t talk about health care,\u201d said one of his roommates, Ivan Light. \u201cIt was not on the political agenda at that time. Civil rights was on the agenda.\u201d After moving to Vermont, he became active in politics. A perennial candidate with the Liberty Union Party in the 1970s, he focused on issues like the tax structure. But he also began to study health care seriously. Included in a collection of papers from those days are pamphlets, articles and other material related to medical care. One publication he saved from March 1972 was titled, \u201cHealth Rights News;\u201d its slogan was \u201cHealth care is a human right.\u201d That research soon began to take hold: In October 1976, when he was the Liberty Union candidate for governor, he told The Burlington Free Press that the delivery of medical care was \u201cbasically a national problem\u201d and that he supported \u201cpublic ownership of the drug companies and placing doctors on salaries.\u201d \u201cI believe in socialized medicine,\u201d he said. John Bloch, who has known Mr. Sanders since the 1970s when they were active in Vermont politics, said he thought Mr. Sanders\u2019s views were influenced in part by the people he lived near in the rural town of Stannard, Vt., many of whom were in desperate need of health care. \u201cHe didn\u2019t just come to this as Johnny-come-lately,\u201d Mr. Bloch said. In the interview Sunday, Mr. Sanders said he was particularly affected at the time by a young boy who lived across the road whose teeth, he said, were rotting in his mouth. Deb Richter, a Vermont physician and longtime advocate for single-payer health care, who has worked with Mr. Sanders on the issue for 20 years, said he had always felt that health care was a human right. \u201cYou ask Vermonters, \u2018How long has Bernie been talking about single-payer health care for all?\u2019 and nobody can remember a time he wasn\u2019t talking about it,\u2019\u2019 she said. After Mr. Sanders was elected mayor of Burlington in 1981, he largely emphasized local issues, like property taxes and affordable housing. \u201cI was the mayor of a city of 40,000 people,\u201d Mr. Sanders said in the interview. \u201cTalking about national health care is not exactly what you talk to the board of aldermen about.\u201d By then, he had also become somewhat fixated on Canada. In September 1981, he invited the director of the Quebec Insurance Board to speak about  the province\u2019s health insurance plan. Later, he demanded more accountability from the state\u2019s health insurance company and encouraged a review of hospital budgets.  As he pondered higher office, his focus on health care intensified. Even before he announced his 1986 campaign for governor, he said he planned to run in part on controlling medical costs, according to an article in the Vermont newspaper The Times Argus. He lost that race but gathered valuable information in the process: During his campaign, his team had polled Vermont residents on issues. \u201cTo my surprise,\u201d Mr. Sanders said in 1987, \u201cthe issue that Vermonters felt most strongly about was the rapidly rising costs of health care.\u201d That finding served to galvanize his actions on health care. He quickly set up a task force and charged it with studying how to make the system more affordable. Soon Mr. Sanders and the task force \u2014 which included an expert on the Cuban health care system, professors and a minister \u2014 were traveling to Ottawa, which had  implemented a government-supported, single-payer system. Jed Lowy, who went on the trip, recalled touring a public hospital, visiting a neighborhood community health center and speaking with physicians. \u201cIt was interesting to see another way that health care was provided,\u201d Mr. Lowy said. That trip, and a later one to Montreal, reinforced Mr. Sanders\u2019s idea that Vermont\u2019s northern neighbor had effectively put into practice the kind of accessible, affordable system he had long sought. At a news conference after the Ottawa visit, the task force suggested Burlington could model its health care system after Canada\u2019s. And in unequivocal tones, Mr. Sanders said it would be \u201cabsolutely negligent\u201d not to examine at least some aspects of the Canadian model. In March 1988, the task force released a report recommending the creation of a national health care system. Mr. Sanders\u2019s focus on health care policy met some resistance at home from city employees reluctant to give up benefits they had earned. Mr. Sanders forcefully rebutted the criticism. \u201cYou may regard this as \u2018propaganda\u2019,\u201d he wrote tersely in response to a letter from an angry constituent in December 1982. \u201cI expect that you may not have talked to citizens who are taking their food money to pay for medical care.\u201d By the time Mr. Sanders was mounting his 1988 congressional run, he was speaking about health care in the kind of dogmatic terms he uses today, and he was broadening his vision beyond Vermont. He praised the National League of Cities for adopting a resolution to establish a national health system. Soon after formally announcing his congressional campaign, he set forth his premier agenda item, one that he had imagined since his mother\u2019s death some three decades earlier. \u201cI want to make it emphatically clear,\u201d he said in April 1988, \u201cthat I will make health care reform a top priority as a United States congressman from the state of Vermont.\u201d",

      "content": " LAS VEGAS \u2014 Senator Bernie Sanders introduced a $2.5 trillion housing policy plan on Saturday that would include ending homelessness and limiting rent increases across the country by imposing a national rent control standard. Mr. Sanders said that over the next decade, his plan would expand public housing, increase the availability of affordable housing and cap annual rent increases nationally, regardless of income, at no more than one and a half times the rate of inflation or 3 percent, whichever is higher. His campaign said he would be releasing his full plan within the next month. \u201cWe have an affordable housing crisis in Nevada, in Vermont and all over this country that must be addressed,\u201d he told an audience of about 100 people at a union hall in Las Vegas, which was hit hard by the housing crisis a decade ago. \u201cFor too long, this is one of those issues that we just don\u2019t talk about.\u201d This is the second time in the past 15 days that Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign has teased a policy rollout without releasing an actual proposal. Late last month, the Vermont senator said at a health care-focused event in Florence, S.C., that he planned to introduce legislation that would eliminate all medical debt. His campaign followed his pronouncement with a one-page overview of what the plan would entail, including canceling $81 billion of existing medical debt. The campaign also said at the time that a plan would be released within a month. [Sign up for our politics newsletter hosted by Lisa Lerer and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race.] The series of soft rollouts underscore just how policy focused the Democratic presidential primary has become. Led by Senator Elizabeth Warren, the field has been introducing policy plans at a pace that at times has been frenetic. Mr. Sanders has long advocated for affordable housing, even during his days as mayor of Burlington, Vt., in the 1980s. But though he suggested housing was not a front-burner topic for many politicians, other 2020 candidates have also introduced housing policies. Ms. Warren and Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former housing secretary under President Barack Obama, have already released their own housing proposals. Senator Kamala Harris has also introduced a bill that would allow overburdened renters to access a sliding tax credit based on factors like income and cost of rent. Mr. Sanders said he would pay for the plan by instituting a wealth tax on the top one-tenth of 1 percent of American households, or about 175,000 households, but provided little else in the way of specific details. During his address, part of a weekend swing through Nevada that also featured a rally at the University of Nevada, Reno, on Friday, Mr. Sanders also attacked President Trump and attempted to draw a contrast between his childhood and the president\u2019s more privileged upbringing. \u201cUnlike Donald Trump, I did not grow up in a wealthy family or live in some fancy house,\u201d he said, a thought he has expressed before. In a rare occurrence, Mr. Sanders also mentioned his mother during his address, saying she had always wanted to move out of the three-and-a-half room rent-controlled apartment in Brooklyn, where they lived when he was a boy. \u201cMy mother\u2019s dream was that someday we would move out of that rent-controlled apartment in Brooklyn and we would own a home of our own,\u201d he said. \u201cMy mother died young, and her dream was never fulfilled. But during her life, at least our family was always able to afford a roof over our heads, because we were living in a rent-controlled building, which meant that for our family and all the other families in our building, rents could not be arbitrarily raised.\u201d [Which Democrats are leading the 2020 presidential race this week?] As with many of his proposals, Mr. Sanders acknowledged that the cost of his housing plan would be steep. \u201cI have no doubt that within five minutes after this speech is made public, my critics will be jumping up and down as is usually the case and they will tell you that the plan that I am releasing is expensive,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the truth is it is expensive.\u201d Mr. Sanders also promised to commit $32 billion over five years to end homelessness, and provide outreach services for people experiencing chronic homelessness. He did not say how he would end it; his campaign said more details would be in his full proposal.",

      "content": "  Senator Bernie Sanders has overhauled his New Hampshire state operations five months before the primary, as his campaign fights to maintain support in a state he won by more than 22 percentage points in 2016. In a series of moves, the campaign has replaced the New Hampshire state director, Joe Caiazzo, with Shannon Jackson, who is a member of Mr. Sanders\u2019s inner circle and who led the senator\u2019s re-election campaign in Vermont last year. Mr. Caiazzo, who was Mr. Sanders\u2019s political director in Massachusetts and Rhode Island during the 2016 campaign, has been named state director in Massachusetts. The moves were announced to the campaign\u2019s New Hampshire staff on Sunday. \u201cWe feel really good about where we stand in New Hampshire right now,\u201d said Faiz Shakir, the Sanders campaign manager. \u201cThe poll numbers, the volunteer capacity, the crowds that we have been getting at these events all suggest to us that we are in a very good position.\u201d He added: \u201cObviously, much work to do to continue that trend.\u201d The Sanders campaign also recently shook up its top leadership, promoting both Ari Rabin-Havt, the chief of staff, and Arianna Jones, the communications director, to the position of deputy campaign manager and bringing on a new senior communications adviser. [Here are six takeaways from the September Democratic debate.] Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign said the moves in New Hampshire and elsewhere are an attempt to expand his operations and organize supporters in the northeast as they look beyond the early states toward Super Tuesday, when several other New England states, including Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s state of Massachusetts, will vote. The campaign recently hired a Maine state director, Ben Collings, a member of the Maine Legislature who ran Maine for Mr. Sanders\u2019s 2016 campaign. \u201cThis campaign is building up and spreading out over the next few months,\u201d Mr. Shakir said. But Mr. Sanders\u2019s decision to shake up his campaign in first-in-the-nation New Hampshire, a state he almost certainly must win to have a chance at the nomination, underscores the challenges he faces in recreating the formula from his landslide victory there against Hillary Clinton. Without the same mix of New Hampshire\u2019s anti-establishment and progressive voters all to himself this time, he has fallen into the 20s in most polls, bunched up with Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Ms. Warren at the top of the surveys in the state. The rise of Ms. Warren, in particular, has created difficulties for Mr. Sanders because, like him, she is from a neighboring state and, also like him, appeals to much of the party\u2019s left. Potentially even more threatening, she represents a new alternative for the voters who were mostly aligned with Mr. Sanders in 2016 to oppose Mrs. Clinton. What gets less attention, but which some New Hampshire Democrats say helps explain Mr. Sanders\u2019s challenges there, are the long-shot candidates: Andrew Yang, a former tech entrepreneur, Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii and Marianne Williamson, a best-selling self-help author, are drawing attention from the sort of avant-garde voters who had no such alternative options last cycle other than the Vermont senator. New Hampshire Democrats said Mr. Caiazzo, who grew up in Massachusetts and last year ran the re-election campaign of Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, was a traditional party operative and always something of an unusual fit for Mr. Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist whose campaign is about upending the establishment. And increasingly, Mr. Sanders, in New Hampshire and across the country, is focused less on winning over traditional Democratic activists than he is in mobilizing volunteers as well as new supporters, particularly individuals who have not participated in past primaries, including independents and disaffected Republicans. New Hampshire Democrats also believe that Mr. Sanders did not have the sort of organization befitting the candidate who had won the state so overwhelmingly three years ago. Mr. Jackson, who was previously the Sanders campaign\u2019s northeast regional director, has worked with Mr. Sanders for years, including in his senate office in Burlington, Vt. He also helped start Our Revolution, the senator\u2019s political advocacy group. In a statement, Mr. Jackson said he was \u201chonored to be taking on a more direct role in this critically important state\u201d and praised the team there. The campaign said it had recently added a campus outreach director and labor outreach director in New Hampshire as well. Glenn Thrush contributed reporting.",

      "content": "  CHARLESTON, S.C. \u2014 Clutching a cup of tea to soothe his hoarsening voice, Senator Bernie Sanders took the stage at the College of Charleston this week with a familiar message for anyone who had been following him since 2015, inveighing against the economic system (\u201cgrossly unfair\u201d), political system (\u201ccorrupt\u201d) and health care system (\u201cinsanity\u201d). But Mr. Sanders said something needed to be different in 2020 if his promised revolution was going to come to fruition. \u201cI\u2019m here to ask for your help, to help me win the Democratic primary here in South Carolina,\u201d he said. \u201cWith your help, we can do that. We do that, we\u2019re going to win the nomination.\u201d Many Democrats in the presidential race are banking on strong showings in Iowa and New Hampshire, the first nominating contests, to slingshot them into South Carolina with political momentum and then on to Super Tuesday. But Mr. Sanders knows that will not be enough \u2014 or at least it was not enough for him in 2016. That year, he stunned the political world by almost beating Hillary Clinton in the Iowa caucuses. He trounced her in New Hampshire. Then, in more diverse South Carolina, where black voters make up an estimated 60 percent of the Democratic primary electorate, he got annihilated anyway. He lost every county in the state, with Mrs. Clinton carrying more than half of them with more than 80 percent of the vote. Only in one did Mr. Sanders even top 40 percent. South Carolina was the signal defeat in his upstart challenge to Mrs. Clinton, the state where his inability to win support from African-Americans, a crucial Democratic constituency, was laid bare. Mrs. Clinton marched across the South with similarly huge margins, building an unmatchable delegate advantage to clinch the nomination. \u201cThe reason why he got beat here so badly last time is the African-American community didn\u2019t support him, didn\u2019t know who he was, so they went with who they knew,\u201d said Kwadjo Campbell, Mr. Sanders\u2019s South Carolina state director. As in his race against Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Sanders faces in former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. a familiar face with a reservoir of good will among many black voters \u2014 a man who served two terms as the No. 2 to the first black president, and who begins far ahead in the South Carolina polls. Only now the race also includes two major black candidates, Senators Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey, as well as another senator, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who is peeling off support on the ideological left. Faiz Shakir, Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign manager, called the South Carolina challenge \u201csignificant but not insurmountable,\u201d especially if Mr. Sanders performs well in the three preceding states, including Nevada. \u201cThere is a really great possibility for South Carolina \u2014 I won\u2019t say win \u2014 but I do think cutting margins significantly,\u201d Mr. Shakir said, \u201cparticularly in the African-American community, which I think he will do much better with. That\u2019s the path.\u201d After mostly minimizing South Carolina four years ago, if not seeming to downright disregard it at times, Mr. Sanders has returned with a previously unseen vigor. Once he had declared his candidacy in 2015, Mr. Sanders went more than three months before his first visit to South Carolina (one trip was postponed after the Charleston church shooting). This year, he has already visited seven times as a candidate; by this weekend, when Mr. Sanders visits on a college tour, he will have notched as many visits to the state as he made in the 2016 cycle. \u201cWe\u2019re going to give the vice president a run for his money,\u201d said Nina Turner, a national co-chair of the Sanders campaign, who is black and who has been instrumental in the South Carolina strategy, visiting the state herself at least twice a month. Mr. Sanders has unveiled two of his major policy proposals in South Carolina \u2014 his criminal justice plan and his \u201cThurgood Marshall Plan\u201d for public education \u2014 as part of an effort to show his commitment to black voters in the state, advisers said. He has six offices here and 52 paid staff members (nearly three-quarters are people of color, according to the campaign). A Sanders spokesman in South Carolina, Michael Wukela, said the Vermont senator now counts 24 endorsements in the state \u2014 20 of them from black supporters \u2014 compared with a total of only five at the end of the 2016 race. Members of the clergy are being wooed, as well. \u201cI know he\u2019s been working hard,\u201d the Rev. Joseph Darby, an influential pastor in Charleston who is close to Mr. Biden, said of Mr. Sanders. \u201cI give him an E for effort.\u201d An early snapshot of the state suggests that Mr. Sanders still faces an uphill climb. In a selfie line after a shrimp-and-grits breakfast event in Georgetown, S.C., last month, nearly all of the people waiting for photographs with the senator were white. And in conversations with black leaders and voters, including some at Mr. Sanders\u2019s own events, there was still uncertainty about Mr. Sanders and his policies. Several people mentioned his \u201cMedicare for All\u201d proposal for a government-run health insurance system. Mae McKnight, 74, who attended the Georgetown event, said she was still deciding which candidate would win her vote. She was leaning toward Mr. Biden to \u201cget the country back to some kind of calm normalcy,\u201d she said. Though she liked Mr. Sanders, she said, \u201cI would not want him to take my insurance plan.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t care who gets it as long as I can keep mine,\u201d Ms. McKnight added, noting she was on her teachers\u2019 union\u2019s health plan. Pamela Venson, a retiree who lives in Florence, showed up at the recent Galivants Ferry candidate stump, which Mr. Sanders ended up missing to rest his voice. Ms. Venson, a Biden supporter, called the former vice president \u201cseasoned,\u201d but saw Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren as \u201ctoo risky\u201d and \u201ctoo left.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have the money first,\u201d Ms. Venson said of their ambitious policy plans. Marvin R. Pendarvis, a state representative supporting former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas, said that many black voters viewed Mr. Sanders\u2019s expansive agenda warily. \u201cThey like the idea of all that stuff. And it would be great in a perfect world. But we don\u2019t live in a perfect world,\u201d Mr. Pendarvis said. \u201cMany black Americans are just reluctant to take the kind of risks like that. We want something a little more concrete.\u201d National polls show that African-American voters remain Mr. Biden\u2019s most reliable voting bloc, and an area of relative weakness for Mr. Sanders. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released this week found Mr. Biden with the support of 49 percent of black Democratic primary voters nationwide, while Mr. Sanders had only 5 percent support. (Among all Democratic primary voters surveyed, Mr. Biden led with 31 percent, Ms. Warren had 25 percent and Mr. Sanders had 14 percent.)  The centerpiece of Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign pitch remains economic and class matters: Medicare for All, a $15 minimum wage, eliminating student debt. References to racial justice remain the rhetorical flourishes of his stump speech. Advisers to Mr. Sanders have pressed him to speak more about his own civil rights activism as a student in the 1960s, as he did in an early campaign speech in Chicago. Mr. Sanders has mostly ignored them. \u201cCan I get him to talk about anything in his life? It\u2019s very hard,\u201d Mr. Shakir said. Alicia Garza, a founder of Black Lives Matter who was in South Carolina this week on a bus tour promoting a new women\u2019s group, Supermajority, noted that Mr. Sanders had been criticized for not sufficiently connecting racial and economic justice. \u201cBlack women like myself, we\u2019ve never gone for the okey-doke\u201d that fixing economic issues would solve other problems, she said. Of Mr. Sanders, she added, \u201cI\u2019m also willing to give the grace of, \u2018You\u2019ve got until February to convince me you finally get it.\u2019\u201d Mr. Campbell, the Sanders state director, said the senator had \u201cgrown in that regard.\u201d \u201cIf you listen to him talk about African-American communities, he doesn\u2019t shy away from the whole idea of racial discrimination,\u201d Mr. Campbell said. The campaign is certainly trying to organize black voters. Mariah Moore-McClure, an 18-year-old who moved from Chicago to attend Benedict College, a historically black college in Columbia, was part of a group the Sanders campaign had bused to the Galivants Ferry event about two hours away. \u201cOn my campus, he\u2019s doing great,\u201d she said. Within the Sanders campaign, tensions between the new guard and the originalists have been present throughout this run, including in a recent shake-up of his New Hampshire operation. In an interview, Mr. Campbell took an oblique swipe at those who ran South Carolina for Mr. Sanders four years ago. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a solid state team from the state that knows the state,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that\u2019s different from last time.\u201d Mr. Sanders\u2019s 2016 base \u2014 which generally skews younger, whiter and more progressive \u2014 remains the core of his 2020 coalition. At Galivants Ferry, the three volunteers at his booth in the early evening were supporters dating to 2016. \u201cIf we have anything to do with it,\u201d said Goffinet McLaren, who is white and a retiree who lives in Pawleys Island, \u201cwe would encourage black voters to vote for him this time.\u201d",

      "subtitle": "A plan for national rent control and for reining in speculators, but also for building wealth through homeownership.",
      "author": "Emily Badger",
      "content": " Bernie Sanders has gone much further than any of the other 2020 Democratic presidential candidates in proposing not just more money for affordable housing, or more enforcement of fair-housing laws, but also fundamental changes in how the housing market functions. His most startling ideas \u2014 a national rent control standard, and new taxes on land speculation and house \u201cflipping\u201d \u2014 would bring America closer to the idea that housing should be treated as shelter and not a commodity. But in the housing plan his campaign released Wednesday, Mr. Sanders doesn\u2019t go all the way there. He allows for profit, but not certain kinds of profit, or profit by certain kinds of actors. In that middle ground, somewhere between the private market and social housing for all, things get complicated. The national rent control standard Mr. Sanders has proposed would cap the amount that landlords can raise rents, to shield tenants from escalating housing costs and, in a deeper sense, the excesses of capitalism in the housing market. Landlords could raise the rent by no more than 3 percent per year, or one and a half times the rate of inflation, whichever is higher. His housing plan says nothing about the profits of people buying and selling homes in the normal course of homeownership. In fact, Mr. Sanders would invest an additional $8 billion into federal programs to help first-time home buyers, precisely because homeownership in America is often a means of building wealth. Between the two proposals lies a fraught balance: One would curb profits in the housing market, while the other acknowledges that many Americans depend on those profits. Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign seeks to reconcile the two by arguing that rich investors or landlords shouldn\u2019t get to make so much, while ordinary American families should have a chance to make something. \u201cWe want to return to the notion that homeownership can be an asset builder for working people and average American families, and it is not just a vehicle to commodify to make the rich richer,\u201d said Josh Orton, a senior adviser to the Sanders campaign and its national policy director. In practice, however, it\u2019s not always obvious how to distinguish the working families from the rich investors, or how to devise policies that crack down on the one but not the other. Some middle-class families, for example, build wealth by owning rental properties. And landlord groups are skeptical that 3 percent rent increases would build them much wealth, especially when property taxes, insurance rates and utilities aren\u2019t also capped. Mr. Sanders\u2019s proposal would also put a hefty tax on house flipping, hitting owners who sell a property for more than the original price within five years of purchase (for a place they don\u2019t occupy). But that definition would cover people we don\u2019t think of as flippers: a small-scale general contractor who remodels two homes a year; a family that buys a home for an aging parent who later dies; a landlord who herself faces financial distress and must get out of the business. Mr. Sanders has similarly proposed a tax on empty homes, aimed at speculators who sit on vacant properties until they become more lucrative to redevelop, or simply profitable to resell. That is a real problem in some communities, leaving neighbors to live with blight for years. But owning an empty home doesn\u2019t necessarily make you a speculator. Someone who has put a property on the market and struggled to sell it for months might end up facing this tax. The full proposal, emphasizing the feel-good parts of the market but not the others, is trying to have it both ways, said Jenny Schuetz, a housing economist at the Brookings Institution who has been following housing proposals from the 2020 candidates. \u201cIn some ideal universe, people would buy homes (or rental properties) that appreciated slightly faster than inflation, allowing them to build wealth, but without housing costs rising too fast to pressure renters, deter new homeowners, or create excess capital gains,\u201d Ms. Schuetz wrote in an email. \u201cIn that context, both rent control and flipping taxes make sense. The problem is, with any semblance of a private real estate market, land and housing values don\u2019t behave that way.\u201d She is skeptical that it is even possible to design or regulate a market that gives modest returns to individual homeowners, but never gives big returns to landlords; that penalizes greedy flippers, but never harms small-time contractors; that taxes vacant homes but doesn\u2019t punish working families. Mr. Sanders\u2019s ideas invite a host of questions about how they would technically work (how do we police a million landlords?) and where their legal authority would come from (would the courts uphold a national rent control law?). But these deeper questions about the kind of housing market voters might want seem worth hashing out, regardless of those other details. Mr. Orton, the Sanders adviser, pushed back against the logic of economists that, for one, rent control discourages developers from building and landlords from renting housing that Americans badly need. \u201cI would say to those economists, how is that working out?\u201d he said of the current deference to the market. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing. When we\u2019ve left this to private developers, everything from the crash of the housing market to how we\u2019ve seen gentrification just explode in some of the most vulnerable communities, to how we\u2019ve seen people priced out of what would normally be affordable housing \u2014 this current crisis is the result of that.\u201d",

      "content": " CHAPEL HILL, N.C. \u2014 College students are back on campus. Bernie Sanders is, too. Earlier this month at Iowa State University, he lectured to young voters as they played \u201cGreen New Deal Pong\u201d (the Solo cups were filled with green-colored water) and \u201cBern Bag Toss.\u201d At the University of Nevada, Reno, he croaked through a hoarse voice to address a crowd that stretched from the college lawn to the open-air floors of a parking garage beside it. And at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill on Thursday evening, he implored students to get themselves to the primary polls come February \u2014 and vote for him. \u201cYou have friends out there, and I know you do, who think that the political system\u201d is absurd, he said, using a colorful expletive. \u201cTell them that instead of just complaining, they must get involved into the political process.\u201d It was a sentiment he has repeated often this month as he crisscrossed the country on what has amounted to a whirlwind back-to-school tour. In Iowa, Nevada, North Carolina and South Carolina, he has by turns used flattery (\u201cYour generation is the most progressive younger generation in the history of this country\u201d) and subtle warnings (\u201cThe future of this country and in fact the world rests with your generation\u201d) to bolster his appeals. Everywhere, his goal was the same: muster a version of the army of young voters who propelled his campaign in 2016. His message was one that has resonated with Brianna Williams, 19, who arrived with a group of friends to hear him in Chapel Hill. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of his policies, and I\u2019m just excited for what he has to offer as a candidate,\u201d she said. But she was just as excited by Senator Elizabeth Warren. \u201cI would love to see a woman running the country,\u201d she said. \u201cThat would be really cool.\u201d Last time around, Mr. Sanders\u2019s rants against the elite and promises of free college tuition endeared him to legions of young fans. It also helped that Mr. Sanders \u2014 74 at the time, with unruly white hair and an old-school Brooklyn accent \u2014 was both decidedly uncool and new to presidential politics, affording his campaign a paradoxical edge that inspired millions of young supporters to \u201cfeel the bern\u201d and vote for him over Hillary Clinton. As he fights anew for the Democratic nomination, it is not lost on him or his allies that his success hinges, in no small part, on his ability to capture that enthusiasm again \u2014 for both the optics of his race and the actual votes. But this time he is no longer an insurgent, nor is he the only anti-establishment candidate in the race \u2014 factors that helped boost his standing among young voters. With the race entering the crucial fall period, other candidates, including Ms. Warren and Andrew Yang, have begun siphoning off some of his support. [Sign up for our politics newsletter hosted by Lisa Lerer and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race.] Even Mr. Sanders\u2019s closest advisers acknowledge that he cannot take for granted a voting cohort they view as critical, even if it is traditionally unreliable in actually making it to the ballot box. \u201cLast time it was much more organic,\u201d Faiz Shakir, Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign manager, said. \u201cAnd this time it\u2019s far more intentional.\u201d In interviews, many young voters still praised Mr. Sanders, sometimes breathlessly \u2014 citing his authenticity and conviction but also his calls for free college and universal health care and his proposal to cancel student debt. But many also expressed curiosity, if not exuberance, about other candidates \u201cI love everything he stands for,\u201d said Asha Loutsch, 18, as she sat with a circle of friends who were waiting for his event at the University of Iowa. \u201cI think he really cares about what he\u2019s trying to say. Like, he\u2019s always getting up in there, you know?\u201d But she also said she was interested in Ms. Warren and wanted to hear her speak. Jiego Lim, an 18-year-old student at the University of Nevada, Reno, who was volunteering at Mr. Sanders\u2019s event there, said he supported Mr. Sanders but was also intrigued by Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Senator Kamala Harris. \u201cI feel like we need a fresh new face in politics,\u201d he said. \u201cBernie comes off aggressive to me sometimes.\u201d Others were less equivocal. \u201cHe\u2019s America\u2019s dad,\u201d offered Gabriel Olier, 19, a student in Reno. \u201cI love Bernie.\u201d That affection for Mr. Sanders is reflected in some more tangible metrics. His campaign said it had so far raised over $1 million from people under the age of 25, a relatively small figure compared to his overall haul but one that nevertheless points to his continued strength with young voters. [Here\u2019s the latest data on who\u2019s leading the race to be the Democratic nominee.] And in most polls, Mr. Sanders still maintains a strong lead among young voters: A recent NBC/Wall Street Journal survey showed that a third of voters under 35 supported him. Yet at the same time, a quarter of these respondents said they supported Ms. Warren, suggesting Mr. Sanders no longer has the same hold on the group he had in 2016. Any candidate relying on the support of younger voters faces an undeniable challenge: Younger voters tend not to vote in high numbers compared with other groups. In the 2016 election, for instance, only 11 percent of voters under 30 participated in the Iowa caucuses, representing just 15 percent of the total, according to an estimate from the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts University. But the high turnout among young voters during the 2018 midterm elections has given some experts hope that the 2020 election will be different. That strong showing has provided organizers with a larger pool to identify and target potential presidential voters. Issues, including climate change, criminal justice, health care and gun control, are also motivating young voters to act. \u201cThe truth is that if younger people in this country voted at the same level as people 65 and over, we could transform this country,\u201d Mr. Sanders said this month at the University of Iowa. \u201cPlease do it!\u201d John Della Volpe, the director of polling at Harvard\u2019s Institute of Politics, said that Mr. Sanders was still \u201cdoing really well\u201d but that the field was more complex and his pool of support was smaller. \u201cAt this stage, he\u2019s essentially sharing support of young people in most polls with Elizabeth Warren,\u201d Mr. Della Volpe said. \u201cThe idea of going after structural reforms is really, I think, what is resonating so clearly with young people.\u201d Indeed, of all the other candidates, it is Ms. Warren who appears to be generating the most powerful wave of energy among young voters in Democratic presidential politics \u2014 particularly among those who once supported Mr. Sanders. Olivia Stecklein, 19, a student at the University of Iowa, said she had been a fan of Mr. Sanders since 2015 but was now choosing between him and Ms. Warren. \u201cI feel like they\u2019re pretty similar, but I just kind of like how Elizabeth Warren has a set-out plan for everything,\u201d she said. \u201cShe just seems very prepared.\u201d Eliza Link, 18, a University of Iowa student, said she was also deciding between Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren. \u201cI think they\u2019re both the cool aunt and uncle of the political race right now,\u201d she said. With his characteristic verve that can exhaust even young reporters, Mr. Sanders has been in an all-out sprint to earn the vote of the youths, months before any of them can even cast their vote. His team set up a Bernie Summer School program to train campus leaders in the art of campaigning. He urged his campaign to get him back on college campuses in the first weeks of the new school year. He constantly asks his team to share data on young voters. To win over the group, however, Mr. Sanders will have to convince people like Tim Watts, 19. Before Mr. Sanders\u2019s event in Reno, Mr. Watts wore a \u201cMATH\u201d hat, the universal accessory of Yang supporters. But despite his overt support for Mr. Yang \u2014 who in some ways is benefiting from the outsider status among young voters that Mr. Sanders enjoyed in 2016 \u2014 Mr. Watts said he had not yet closed the door on Mr. Sanders. \u201cI\u2019m part of the Yang gang, I guess,\u201d he said. \u201cI will probably feel the bern later.\u201d",

      "author": "Thomas Kaplan",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Senator Bernie Sanders on Tuesday unveiled a proposal to create a new tax on the wealth of the richest Americans, including a steep tax on billionaires that could greatly diminish their fortunes. With the proposal, Mr. Sanders is embracing an idea that has been a centerpiece of the campaign of his top progressive rival, Senator Elizabeth Warren. But while Ms. Warren came first, Mr. Sanders is going bigger. His wealth tax would apply to a larger number of households, impose a higher top rate and raise more money. Mr. Sanders\u2019s plan to tax accumulated wealth, not just income, is particularly aggressive in how it would erode the fortunes of billionaires. His tax would cut in half the wealth of the typical billionaire after 15 years, according to two economists who worked with the Sanders campaign on the plan. Mr. Sanders would use the money generated by his wealth tax to fund the housing plan he released last week and a forthcoming plan for universal child care, as well as to help pay for \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d \u201cLet me be very clear: As president of the United States, I will reduce the outrageous and grotesque and immoral level of income and wealth inequality,\u201d Mr. Sanders said in an interview. \u201cWhat we are trying to do is demand and implement a policy which significantly reduces income and wealth inequality in America by telling the wealthiest families in this country they cannot have so much wealth.\u201d Asked if he thought billionaires should exist in the United States, Mr. Sanders said, \u201cI hope the day comes when they don\u2019t.\u201d He added, \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be tomorrow.\u201d [Sign up for our politics newsletter and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race.] \u201cI don\u2019t think that billionaires should exist,\u201d he said, adding that there would always be rich people and others with less money. \u201cThis proposal does not eliminate billionaires, but it eliminates a lot of the wealth that billionaires have, and I think that\u2019s exactly what we should be doing.\u201d The proposal from Mr. Sanders is the latest sign of the push in the Democratic Party to collect substantially more revenue from the wealthiest Americans by rethinking how they are taxed \u2014 a move that could provide large sums of money to finance new social programs. And it is a significant development in the competition of ideas between Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren, the two leading progressive candidates in the Democratic primary race. Both of their plans would need to be passed by Congress in order to take effect \u2014 a virtual impossibility unless Democrats win control of the Senate in the 2020 elections, and far from a sure thing even then. Ms. Warren\u2019s plan touched off a number of questions about the feasibility of creating a wealth tax, including whether such a tax would be constitutional, how it would be enforced and whether it would generate as much money as has been projected. On Tuesday, Ms. Warren welcomed Mr. Sanders\u2019s plan. \u201cI\u2019m delighted to see people talking about a wealth tax,\u201d she told WBUR. \u201cI think it\u2019s great because this is how we make big structural change in this economy. We need all of the presidential candidates talking about it; where are the rest of them?\u201d Mr. Sanders, of Vermont, would create an annual tax that would apply to households with a net worth above $32 million \u2014 about 180,000 households in total, or about the top 0.1 percent, according to the economists who worked on the plan. He would impose a 1 percent tax on net worth above $32 million, with increasing marginal rates topping out at 8 percent on net worth over $10 billion. For single filers, the brackets would be halved, meaning the tax would kick in at $16 million. By contrast, the wealth tax proposed by Ms. Warren, of Massachusetts, would apply to households with a net worth above $50 million \u2014 an estimated 70,000 households in total. The structure of her plan is simpler: She would apply a 2 percent tax on net worth from $50 million to $1 billion, and a 3 percent tax on net worth above $1 billion. Unlike the Sanders plan, the tax brackets would be the same for married and single filers. Mr. Sanders\u2019s tax is projected to raise $4.35 trillion over a decade, while Ms. Warren\u2019s is projected to raise $2.6 trillion over the same time period. Those estimates were produced by Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, two economists at the University of California, Berkeley, with whom both the Sanders and Warren campaigns consulted as they developed their proposals. (The projection for Ms. Warren\u2019s plan differs slightly from their original estimate of $2.75 trillion earlier this year.) \u201cThe Sanders plan is really pitched at the idea that we don\u2019t want billionaires and decabillionaires to be billionaires and decabillionaires for as long as they currently are,\u201d Mr. Saez said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to erode their fortunes much faster than the Warren wealth tax.\u201d Mr. Sanders included several steps in his plan to enforce the tax, including creating a \u201cnational wealth registry,\u201d increasing funding for the Internal Revenue Service and requiring audits of many taxpayers who are subject to the wealth tax, including all billionaires. Mr. Saez and Mr. Zucman calculated how the Warren and Sanders wealth taxes would have affected the fortunes of the richest Americans had each been in effect since 1982. The fortune of Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder who Forbes said was worth $160 billion last year, would have been $87 billion under the Warren plan and $43 billion under the Sanders plan. Over all, the economists found, the cumulative wealth of the top 15 richest Americans in 2018 \u2014 amounting to $943 billion, using estimates from Forbes \u2014 would have been $434 billion under the Warren plan and $196 billion under the Sanders plan. Mr. Sanders is hardly a newcomer to the idea of a wealth tax. In a 1997 book, he wrote that it was \u201ctime, high time, to establish a tax on wealth similar to those that exist in most European countries.\u201d In 2017, he included a wealth tax on a list of financing options for Medicare for all. Ms. Warren was quick to harness the idea in the 2020 race. She released her wealth tax proposal in January, weeks before Mr. Sanders began his campaign. Since then, the proposal has become a cornerstone of Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign and a fixture of her stump speech, even prompting chants of \u201cTwo cents!\u201d from crowds. The money from her tax would go toward other policy plans she has issued, including her proposals for universal child care, student debt cancellation and tuition-free public college.",

      "author": "Margot Sanger-Katz",
      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 Bernie Sanders has long wanted to remake the health care system so no one will have to pay directly for medical care again. Now, he also wants to go back and cancel all the medical debts of people who have been billed under the current system. In a plan released Saturday, Mr. Sanders, the Vermont senator and presidential candidate, proposes wiping out an estimated $81 billion in existing debt and changing rules around debt collection and bankruptcy. He also calls for replacing the giant credit reporting agencies with a \u201cpublic credit registry\u201d that would ignore medical debt when calculating credit scores. The proposals reflect Mr. Sanders\u2019s concern that the medical system has placed financial hardships on too many Americans, by discouraging them from seeking needed medical care \u2014 but also by saddling them with expensive and unfair bills that can harm their financial security, ding their credit and, in some cases, lead to bankruptcy. The plan is Mr. Sanders\u2019s latest effort to transform the health care system in America, a goal on which he has staked not just his second presidential run, but much of his political legacy. His proposal also separates him from other presidential candidates: While several of them have come to embrace his \u201cMedicare for all\u201d plan to create a government-run health insurance system, he is the first top-tier contender to call for such drastic measures on medical debt. \u201cWe\u2019re addressing it on both ends,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cWe\u2019re addressing it now by trying to help the people who have past due medical bills. And we\u2019re addressing it by finally creating a health care system that guarantees coverage to people without any premiums, without any deductibles, without any out-of-pocket expenses.\u201d [Sign up for our politics newsletter and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race.] Medical debt affects Americans who lack health insurance, of course. But it is also increasingly affecting people who have insurance with holes, like high deductibles or limited networks of doctors whose care is paid for. Around 16 percent of adults with credit reports have at least one medical debt, according to a study published last year in the journal Health Affairs. The plan calls for the government to negotiate and cancel the debts, though it does not specify the precise mechanism. While eliminating every American\u2019s medical debt would probably not come cheap, Mr. Sanders\u2019s plan could wind up costing far less than the total amount of debt he is seeking to cancel. Craig Antico, a founder of the charity RIP Medical Debt, which buys and forgives medical debt, estimated that the market price for $81 billion in debt could be as low as $500 million. Most past-due medical debt never gets paid, which is why bill collectors are often willing to sell the debts for pennies on the dollar. The plan would also create a public credit rating agency to \u201creplace\u201d for-profit companies like Equifax, and it would exclude medical debts from credit ratings. It would establish a new legal process, managed by the bankruptcy court system, to help adjudicate medical debts that are not yet in collections. Studies suggest that medical debts can be less damaging to people\u2019s credit than other kinds of debt, in part because the credit reporting agencies treat people\u2019s ability to pay medical bills as less predictive of creditworthiness than, say, their ability to pay credit card bills or car payments. And, despite the news media\u2019s focus on particularly large medical bills, the typical bill in collections is less than $600, according to the Health Affairs article. But medical debts do affect credit somewhat, and they can cause psychological stress, beyond the financial consequences. A survey of people with medical debts conducted by The New York Times and the Kaiser Family Foundation in 2016 found that 44 percent of adults under 65 who had problems paying medical bills said those bills had a \u201cmajor effect\u201d on their lives. Fear of medical debts causes some people to avoid needed medical care. And medical bills can affect other parts of people\u2019s finances that are harder to measure, showing up as an unpaid credit card bill or a missed loan payment. \u201cI have a belief that if a plan like this could eliminate the debt that\u2019s causing hardship, it could make a huge difference in people\u2019s lives,\u201d Mr. Antico said. The Sanders campaign circulated statistics suggesting that more than 500,000 Americans declare bankruptcy each year because of medical bills. That number, derived from a survey of bankrupt individuals, overstates the impact of medical bills on bankruptcy. The study itself noted that health problems can cause bankruptcies in two ways, through direct medical bills and through lost income due to illness itself. The 500,000 figure includes both groups. Other research has shown that income losses due to illness are often the bigger financial hit than medical bills. Neither Mr. Sanders\u2019s \u201cMedicare for all\u201d plan nor his medical debt program would address that secondary issue, though he has also called for guaranteeing workers paid medical leave.  The plan \u201cis well targeted,\u201d said Neale Mahoney, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago, who studies medical debt. \u201cIt just may not be that much relief.\u201d [Which Democrats are leading the 2020 presidential race this week?] Mr. Sanders said that, in conversations with people around the country, he had come to see medical debt as the most consistent and visceral manifestation of a broken health care system. At an event this month in Carson City, Nev., for instance, he heard from a veteran who said he had $139,000 in medical debt. When Mr. Sanders asked the man how he would pay off the debt, the man responded: \u201cI can\u2019t. I can\u2019t. I\u2019m going to kill myself.\u201d Those kinds of deeply moving moments, he said, drove him to seek a new way to ameliorate that particular pain as part of his overall vision for changing the health care system. \u201cI have always believed that health care is a human right, and it has always disturbed me immensely that so many of our people are uninsured or underinsured and can\u2019t go to the doctor,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cBut I have learned in this campaign something else, which I didn\u2019t talk about previously, and that is the financial pain that this dysfunctional health care system is causing people.\u201d The new plan is part of a burst of policy-related activity from the Sanders campaign, which also released a housing plan last week that included a proposal to establish a national rent control standard.",

      "author": "Jamelle Bouie",
      "content": " You may have missed it, but late last month, Bernie Sanders\u2019s presidential campaign released the senator\u2019s proposal for revitalizing the American labor movement. If passed into law, his Workplace Democracy Plan would end \u201cat will\u201d employment (employers could no longer dismiss employees for any reason without warning), institute industrywide \u201csectional\u201d bargaining (versus organizing at individual companies) and curtail \u201cright to work\u201d laws. Those measures alone would give unions a little room to breathe in an otherwise anti-labor atmosphere. More than half of Americans have a favorable view of unions, but in 2018 only 10.5 percent of workers were unionized. And nearly three years into his presidency, Donald Trump has been unabashedly hostile toward labor, even after selling himself as a tribune of the \u201cforgotten man.\u201d But the most important parts of Sanders\u2019s plan have to do with striking and other powerful levers. He would give federal employees the right to strike and ban the permanent replacement of any striking workers. He would also end the prohibition on secondary boycotts, which keeps workers from pressuring \u201cneutral\u201d employers \u2014 like suppliers and other service providers \u2014 in the course of an action against their \u201cprimary\u201d employer. This prohibition closes an important avenue for collaboration among workers. Lifting the restriction would open new paths for collective action. [Join Jamelle Bouie as he shines a light on overlooked writing, culture and ideas from around the internet. For exclusive thoughts, photos and reading recommendations, sign up for his newsletter.] This push to enhance workers\u2019 freedom to strike is more consequential than it might look at first glance. Conflict was the engine of labor reform in the 1930s. And mass strikes and picketing, in particular, pushed the federal government to act. In 1934, the historian Irving Bernstein writes in \u201cThe Turbulent Years: A History of the American Worker, 1933-1941,\u201d \u201cthere were 1856 work stoppages involving 1,470,000 workers, by far the highest count in both categories in many years.\u201d In that year, nearly five years into the Great Depression, \u201clabor\u2019s mood was despair compounded with hope.\u201d The despair was self-explanatory. The hope came from the growing conviction that workers had to act of their own accord \u2014 to, Bernstein wrote, \u201ctake matters into their own hands and demonstrate their collective power to recalcitrant employers through the strike.\u201d And strike they did. In Toledo, Ohio, for example, workers demanding union recognition organized a strike against Electric Auto-Lite, an automobile parts manufacturer, and its related firms. When Auto-Lite and its partners hired strikebreakers and kept their factories open, the union worked with the American Workers Party, a small, radical political party that organized jobless workers to keep them from breaking strikes. Together, unionists and labor radicals led mass pickets against Auto-Lite. Thousands of workers, employed and unemployed, surrounded the plant. Fighting broke out when a strikebreaker attacked a striker. The police and company guards attacked, and a battle ensued. The National Guard arrived and the fighting continued. In their attempt to break the siege and evacuate the strikebreakers, troops killed two strikers and injured more than a dozen others. After a week of violence, Auto-Lite agreed to close the factory. The next month, after additional mass protests and the threat of a general strike, the company backed down, recognizing the union and agreeing to rehire the strikers. Mass pickets appeared elsewhere in the country. Late that summer, the United Textile Workers of America called a national strike, demanding union recognition and a shorter workweek. Hundreds of thousands of workers formed pickets at mills as far north as Maine and as far south as Alabama. \u201cThis strike now in progress,\u201d Joseph Shaplen reported in The New York Times, \u201cis obviously a mass movement.\u201d The strike was most active in North and South Carolina, where strikers closed hundreds of plants. \u201cMoving with the speed and force of a mechanized army,\u201d Shaplen wrote in a Sept. 4, 1934, report, \u201cthousands of pickets in trucks and automobiles scurried the countryside in the Carolinas, visiting mill towns and villages and compelling the closing of the plants.\u201d He continued: \u201cThe growing mass character of the picketing operations is rapidly assuming the appearance of military efficiency and precision and is something entirely new in the history of American labor struggles.\u201d Mill owners and management responded with private militiamen and armed strikebreakers, all backed by state and local authorities. A police officer killed a picketer in Augusta, Ga. In one South Carolina mill town, sheriff\u2019s deputies fired on picketers, killing seven. In Rhode Island, armed state troopers \u2014 equipped with machine guns \u2014 drove a crowd of 600 strikers from a mill that refused to close. And during a confrontation in Burlington, N.C., soldiers bayoneted several picketers. The strike ended when the Board of Inquiry for the Cotton Textile Industry, established by President Franklin Roosevelt at the start of the strike, issued its report, which recommended a federal study of work conditions and pay. The union announced victory and ordered the strikers back to work. The strikers themselves felt differently. \u201cMill workers were extremely bitter at the union and its officials for claiming a victory, calling off the strike, and putting their faith in government boards, when the employers had conceded nothing,\u201d the historian Jeremy Brecher notes in \u201cStrike!\u201d The year saw many other monumental strikes. After the San Francisco police killed four workers in a confrontation with striking longshoremen and their allies, local unions announced a general strike. More than 150,000 workers left their jobs, paralyzing the city. And in Minneapolis, tens of thousands of workers walked off the job in solidarity with a Teamsters strike in the city. It was this widespread labor struggle \u2014 as well as an overwhelming victory for New Deal Democrats in the 1934 midterms \u2014 that created new space for political action in 1935. Senator Robert Wagner of New York introduced a labor bill that would give workers \u201cthe right to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing.\u201d Facing re-election and eager to shore up support from labor, Roosevelt signed the National Labor Relations Act that summer. We are not living in an era of mass unemployment and inescapable deprivation. But we\u2019re also very far from broad prosperity. And if the past is any indication, achieving it will require agitation and conflict. Giving workers more freedom to organize and act might produce the confrontation that makes reform possible. Indeed, Sanders could probably go further. Mass picketing has vanished from the arsenal of organized labor, dwindling in the 1950s and \u201960s in the wake of the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947 \u2014 which put new restrictions on the power and activities of labor \u2014 and rendered ineffective by deindustrialization as well as legal prohibitions in the 1970s and \u201980s. Conventional picketing is still around, but as the labor scholar Ahmed White notes, it \u201csimply isn\u2019t effective enough to give real substance to labor rights in this day and age.\u201d There is an opportunity, in other words, for Sanders or any other labor-friendly politician to give even more teeth to the right to strike, to dramatize exploitation through conflict and confrontation and to give labor the tools it needs to forge a path to a better world for people without the privileges of wealth or the power of capital.",

      "author": "Sydney Ember",
      "content": "  BURLINGTON, Vt. \u2014 When it comes time to make critical decisions regarding his presidential campaign, Senator Bernie Sanders often relies on a committee of two: himself and his wife, Jane Sanders. It was Ms. Sanders who provided a medical update after her husband was hospitalized in Las Vegas last week and had two stents inserted into an artery \u2014 issuing a statement and speaking to reporters outside the hospital. When doctors confirmed to her on Thursday that Mr. Sanders had suffered a heart attack, she said, it was her decision to wait until he was discharged the next day to release that information. And when it was time to say publicly that Mr. Sanders would be easing the pace of his campaigning after his heart attack, Ms. Sanders \u2014 who has effectively been running the campaign\u2019s external communications in Vermont this week \u2014 stood beside him to explain the reason: His closest advisers, \u201cespecially me,\u201d had told him to slow down. Ms. Sanders has played a central role in her husband\u2019s political life for decades, acting as his confidante and his closest adviser. Yet as Mr. Sanders weighs the future of his candidacy, never has it been clearer that the two of them are primarily making the calls for his campaign. \u201cHe\u2019ll often say, \u2018Let\u2019s talk to Jane,\u2019\u201d said Representative Ro Khanna of California, one of Mr. Sanders\u2019s national campaign co-chairs. \u201cShe\u2019s the one person Senator Sanders listens to above everybody else \u2014 by an order of magnitude,\u201d Mr. Khanna said. \u201cThere\u2019s no one whose political judgment he trusts more.\u201d In a rare interview on Wednesday at their home in Burlington, Ms. Sanders said it would be \u201cegotistical\u201d to call herself Mr. Sanders\u2019s top adviser but allowed that she was \u201cvery much a close adviser.\u201d Above all, she said, she was \u201chis wife.\u201d \u201cWe share a life, and his life is of public service,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I need to be part of that in order to have a wonderful marriage. It\u2019s necessary for us to work together because he works a lot.\u201d Mr. Sanders said in an interview with NBC News Wednesday that he learned he had suffered a heart attack on the night he entered the hospital last week with chest pains. Ms. Sanders, in the interview with The New York Times shortly afterward, said she only learned of it two days later, last Thursday. Ms. Sanders said the decision not to reveal her husband\u2019s heart attack until the next day was motivated by another crisis in her family occurring at the same time: the sudden cancer diagnosis of her daughter-in-law, Rain\u00e8 Riggs, the wife of Mr. Sanders\u2019s son, Levi Sanders. Ms. Riggs died this weekend, at age 46. \u201cI heard it on Thursday,\u201d Ms. Sanders said, referring to her husband\u2019s heart attack. \u201cBut frankly, I wasn\u2019t thinking about the campaign.\u201d Ms. Sanders\u2019s significant role in her husband\u2019s presidential run recalls the close involvement of other political spouses, including Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton and Nancy Reagan. They had other trusted aides, and Ms. Sanders said her husband does too, listing Jeff Weaver, his 2016 campaign manager who has been by his side for decades; Faiz Shakir, his 2020 campaign manager; and Ari Rabin-Havt, a deputy campaign manager. But if most politicians typically rely on their spouses as part of a larger group of consultants and close friends, Mr. Sanders maintains only a small inner circle and has long leaned primarily on his wife, who operates as something of a co-strategist for the Sanders brand. \u201cWhere Jane goes, Bernie goes,\u201d said Michael Ceraso, a high-ranking aide on Mr. Sanders\u2019s 2016 campaign in New Hampshire and California. \u201cShe is his engine.\u201d She is also fiercely protective of her husband\u2019s image. When Mr. Sanders had elective hernia surgery in 2015, for example, her preference was not to tell the media, according to a Democrat familiar with the conversations at the time. But other advisers convinced her and Mr. Sanders that if they did not disclose the operation and it was later revealed, their secrecy would create a firestorm in the press. Much like with his heart attack last month, the campaign initially only released a statement with spare details. The Sanders partnership formed soon after the two met at a political event during his first campaign for mayor in 1981. When he was in City Hall, she ran his youth office. They married in 1988. When Mr. Sanders was elected to Congress in 1990, Jane Sanders served as his unpaid chief of staff, vetting potential staff members and writing dozens of pieces of legislation. She helped him form the Congressional Progressive Caucus in 1991, worked on his re-election ads and liaised with reporters. Those who have worked with Mr. Sanders say his wife has extraordinary influence over his decisions. If they want him to sign off on something, one way to ensure it happens is to get her buy-in first. That level of trust has made her one of Mr. Sanders\u2019s most important assets. During the 2016 campaign, she was credited with helping to humanize her husband, who can come across as gruff and impersonal, offering a tour of their Burlington home and even showing reporters pictures of their wedding day from a photo album. But she has also complicated his presidential bid: A federal investigation into her role in a 2010 land deal as president of a Vermont college threatened to undercut his populist appeal. (Ms. Sanders\u2019s lawyer said last year that he had been told the investigation had been closed.) She also started a public policy group, the Sanders Institute, that attracted scrutiny because her son served as executive director and drew a salary of $100,000 last year. She suspended its operations in March soon after Mr. Sanders announced his run. And at times, her influence has also frustrated advisers. Some people familiar with the campaign said she would get annoyed when it appeared that decisions were being made without her input, often prompting her to try to reassert control. When Mr. Sanders\u2019s aides were finalizing plans for the campaign announcement earlier this year, for instance, Ms. Sanders questioned whether it was wise to start the race in Brooklyn: Some observers, she warned, might note that Hillary Clinton had located her campaign headquarters in Brooklyn in 2016. Her concern perplexed some Sanders advisers who wondered why that was relevant, according to one Democratic official familiar with the discussion, making the case that it was important to set the announcement in the city where Mr. Sanders and President Trump both grew up, to draw a contrast between their values. (Mr. Sanders ultimately did kick off his candidacy in Brooklyn, with a big rally that drew thousands of supporters.) Mr. Shakir, the campaign manager, said he never heard Ms. Sanders express any concern about the announcement decision. In another instance, Ms. Sanders was unhappy with one of the commercials Mr. Sanders\u2019s consulting team devised for his campaign kickoff earlier this year, people familiar with the matter said. Without discussing their plans with the consultants, the Sanderses decided that he would record a different, more unadorned advertisement from a Burlington studio \u2014 and he ultimately shared that version widely with supporters. But the move prompted the advisers, who played a central role in his 2016 bid, to abruptly quit the campaign. People who know her say Ms. Sanders\u2019s intense involvement stems both from her commitment to changing the world with progressive ideas and from her deep love for her husband. \u201cIt\u2019s a critical relationship for both of them,\u201d said Jim Rader, a Sanders confidant who officiated their wedding. \u201cI think she\u2019s just been a very crucial part of obviously his personal life, but also his professional life.\u201d In the interview, Ms. Sanders said she was most concerned now about getting Mr. Sanders back in good health, including changing his diet to incorporate more vegetables, especially while on the campaign trail. And though she admitted to being worried after his heart scare, she said it had not prompted them to consider dropping out of the race. \u201cThat\u2019s been his entire life \u2014 fighting for the average working people in this country, and this is not the time to stop when it feels like things can really change,\u201d she said. \u201cIf it was more serious,\u201d she added, \u201cI\u2019m sure we would have thought about it.\u201d",

      "content": "  BURLINGTON, Vt. \u2014 Senator Bernie Sanders, in a striking concession for a leading presidential candidate, said on Tuesday that he planned to slow down his pace on the campaign trail after suffering a heart attack a week ago, and acknowledged that voters would likely consider his health when deciding whether to support him. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to change the nature of the campaign a bit,\u201d Mr. Sanders told reporters after a visit with a local cardiologist. \u201cMake sure that I have the strength to do what I have to do.\u201d Mr. Sanders\u2019s remarks stood in sharp contrast with comments in recent days from his campaign advisers, who have insisted that the Vermont senator was neither changing course nor easing his trademark intensity as a result of the heart attack. Given Mr. Sanders\u2019s influential role in the Democratic race, not only as a top candidate but also as a driving force in policy debates, his decision to pull back campaigning injects new uncertainty into the contest \u2014 both for the future of Mr. Sanders\u2019s candidacy and the possible ramifications for other contenders. In recent weeks, the race has become more of a two-person contest between Senator Elizabeth Warren, a fellow liberal who shares many of the same goals as Mr. Sanders, and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., whose policy positions are generally more moderate. Ms. Warren has risen steadily in many polls while both Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders have lost some ground, particularly in surveys of Iowa voters, who will hold the first nominating contest in February. Pollsters said on Tuesday that it was too soon to determine or measure the impact of Mr. Sanders\u2019s health issues on voter preferences in the race, but they noted that his admission about his health would create a new challenge for Mr. Sanders, who, at 78, would be the oldest president ever elected by far. \u200b\u201cThis will just raise the issue of his age\u200b, which to me has always been the Achilles\u2019 heel of the Sanders campaign,\u201d said Andrew Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center, which polls public opinion in the key primary state. \u201cWhen Sanders ran for president in 2016, he was the not-Hillary Clinton candidate and no one paid attention to how old he is. Now, there will be a lot of attention to how old he is, and how old Joe Biden is.\u201d Mr. Biden is 76, while Ms. Warren is 70. President Trump is 73. Speaking to reporters outside his home in Burlington Tuesday, Mr. Sanders gave no indication that he was planning to drop out of the race and said he would continue to campaign actively. Indeed, Mr. Sanders remains formidable: He reported a third-quarter fund-raising total of $25.3 million, the largest in the Democratic field, and he has helped steer many in the party to embrace ideas like \u201cMedicare for all\u201d and tuition-free public colleges. Mr. Sanders has been campaigning almost nonstop when not carrying out his Senate duties in Washington, D.C., a pace that he pointedly noted on Tuesday. \u201cWe were doing, you know, in some cases five or six meetings a day, three or four rallies and town meetings and meeting with groups of people,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to do that.\u201d \u201cI think we\u2019re going to change the nature of the campaign a bit,\u201d he added. \u201cMake sure that I have the strength to do what I have to do.\u201d Asked to clarify what he meant when he said the campaign would change, he replied: \u201cProbably not doing four rallies a day.\u201d Standing next to his wife, Jane, Mr. Sanders also acknowledged that his heart attack could be a factor for voters considering whether to support him. \u201cEverything that happens every day weighs on how people feel about you,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd my own view is that \u2014 and I think it\u2019s the voters\u2019 view \u2014 you look at the totality of who a candidate is. You look at what that candidate stands for, the integrity of that candidate, the history of that candidate.\u201d It has been a difficult week for the Sanders family: In addition to Mr. Sanders\u2019s heart attack, his daughter-in-law Rain\u00e8 Riggs died at age 46, shortly after she was diagnosed with neuroendocrine cancer, according to a death notice. Ms. Riggs was the wife of Levi Sanders, Mr. Sanders\u2019s son. Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign aides were heartened that the first polls since his hospitalization did not show a significant drop in his support. But the candidate and his wife have not been revealing much to the public, or even some of his own staff, about when he would get back to the campaign trail and how aggressive he would be once he does return. It is now almost certain that he will have a far more difficult path to the nomination. Democrats are overwhelmingly focused on finding a candidate they believe can defeat Mr. Trump, having made clear in surveys that ousting a president they loathe is their top priority. Now, in addition to questions about whether he is too far to the left to win over general election voters, Mr. Sanders will have to face doubts about his physical capabilities. Further, unlike in 2016, progressive voters have an alternative to Mr. Sanders in this race. While some of his bedrock supporters will not abandon him, other left-wing voters will gladly cast a vote for Ms. Warren. That was not the case when Mr. Sanders faced Mrs. Clinton in the last primary. Mr. Sanders returned to Burlington over the weekend, after spending three days in a hospital in Las Vegas. His campaign said he felt chest pains during an event last Tuesday, and he was taken to the hospital, where two stents were inserted into an artery. Since then, his campaign has insisted that Mr. Sanders does not intend to drop out of the race. During a telephone call with staff members on Monday, Mr. Sanders said he felt \u201cmore strongly about the need for a political revolution today than I did when I began this campaign.\u201d Jane Sanders, who remains one of Mr. Sanders\u2019s closest advisers, said that idea was \u201csomething that the entire campaign, and especially me, have been saying for months \u2014 not for his health but for the ability to keep up that kind of a pace for everybody else, too.\u201d Campaign officials also downplayed Mr. Sanders\u2019s remarks. \u201cAs Bernie said, we are going to have an active campaign,\u201d Faiz Shakir, Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign manager, said in a statement on Tuesday evening. \u201cInstead of a breakneck series of events that lap the field, we are going to keep a marathoner\u2019s pace that still manages to outrun everyone else.\u201d Another adviser, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive topic, said Mr. Sanders had been thinking about changing the pace of his campaign schedule for some time, and aides discussed this with him when he was in the hospital. Known for keeping a grueling schedule on the campaign trail, Mr. Sanders, who finished second to Mrs. Clinton in the 2016 primary, will often crisscross a state with multiple stops for big rallies and smaller town hall-style events and gatherings. There is no recent precedent for a candidate to suffer such a serious health setback in the midst of a campaign, at least not since President Dwight D. Eisenhower suffered a heart attack in the fall of 1955, a year before his re-election. Mrs. Clinton stayed off the campaign trail for three days in the fall of 2016 after she felt dizzy at a 9/11 commemoration but was only diagnosed with pneumonia. In 1999, former Senator Bill Bradley was briefly sidelined as he sought the Democratic nomination because he had an irregular heartbeat. Mr. Bradley, a former professional basketball player who was only 56 at the time, returned to the campaign trail but was dogged by questions about his health and was beaten decisively by Al Gore.",

      "content": "  Senator Bernie Sanders was recovering in a Las Vegas hospital on Wednesday after being treated for blockage of an artery, forcing him to cancel his events in the coming days and casting uncertainty over a candidacy already struggling to win new voters. Mr. Sanders, 78, experienced \u201csome chest discomfort\u201d at an event Tuesday night, said Jeff Weaver, a longtime adviser; a medical evaluation found blockage in one artery, and two stents were inserted. Mr. Sanders\u2019s hospitalization is likely to intensify the focus on age in the Democratic race, even as much of the public debate has centered on policies like health care and immigration. The three leading Democratic candidates, as well as the president they are vying to challenge, are all in their 70s. One of those Democrats, Joseph R. Biden Jr., 76, has drawn his own age-related scrutiny because of his sometimes rambling discourses and uneven answers in debates. Campaign aides did not provide any further information about Mr. Sanders\u2019s condition and they have not said whether he had suffered a heart attack or whether he was just experiencing chest pain. Late Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Sanders posted a tweet thanking his well wishers and using the incident as an opportunity to plug his signature policy proposal, \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d Inserting stents into arteries is common in the United States \u2014 there are at least 600,000 such procedures a year, and perhaps up to one million. It is usually uncomplicated, and patients return home within a day or two. \u201cThe prognosis is very good,\u201d said Dr. Steven Nissen, chief academic officer of the Heart and Vascular Institute at the Cleveland Clinic. \u201cMost patients are home the next day and back to work very quickly.\u201d He said he did not see it as an impediment to returning to the campaign trail. Still, it is unclear when Mr. Sanders will return to the campaign trail or whether he will be able to participate in the next Democratic debate, on Oct. 15 in Westerville, Ohio, near Columbus. [Have you or your loved ones had experience with stents? We want to hear how it may have affected your life and work. Please share your story in the comments.] Mr. Sanders\u2019s heart issue could prove to be a political problem for him, and it has the potential to change the dynamic of a still-fluid Democratic race. Mr. Sanders has largely avoided scrutiny of his age and his health. But he and his rivals will now be under increasing pressure to release detailed medical records as Democratic voters try to settle on the best candidate to take on President Trump, who is himself 73. Mr. Sanders, Mr. Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is 70, have all said they would release their records before the first voting starts in February. When Mr. Sanders returns to the campaign, he may find what was already his biggest challenge \u2014 finding new converts to his mission \u2014 to be even more difficult. \u201cI do think this makes it harder for him to persuade new supporters to come into his column because this will at least be in the back of people\u2019s minds,\u201d said Erik Smith, a longtime Democratic strategist. The setback with his health also comes amid something of a political slump for Mr. Sanders in his second run for the presidency. He has continued to raise substantial amounts of money from his dedicated supporters \u2014 on Tuesday, his campaign celebrated an impressive third-quarter fund-raising haul of $25.3 million \u2014 and has remained among the top three contenders in the primary. But he has been unable to expand his base beyond those enthusiasts. In recent weeks, he shook up his staff in Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two nominating states, in an effort to jump-start his candidacy as Ms. Warren passed him in some polls. Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign Wednesday said he began experiencing chest pain during a campaign event on Tuesday night in Las Vegas, where he had traveled for a series of appearances. He had visited an outdoor memorial dedicated to victims of the city\u2019s 2017 mass shooting and had hosted a grass-roots fund-raiser at the Shiraz restaurant. The restaurant\u2019s owner, Raja Majid, said in a phone interview Wednesday that Mr. Sanders had spoken to a crowd of about 250 people. As Mr. Sanders began taking questions from the audience, he asked a staff member for a chair, an unusual request from a candidate who typically stands or paces onstage. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long day here,\u201d he said. On Wednesday, Mr. Weaver spoke only in general terms about Mr. Sanders\u2019s prognosis. \u201cSenator Sanders is conversing and in good spirits,\u201d he said in the statement. \u201cHe will be resting up over the next few days. We are canceling his events and appearances until further notice, and we will continue to provide appropriate updates.\u201d Mr. Sanders was to travel to California and Iowa later this week.  Mr. Sanders\u2019s allies quickly downplayed his procedure. RoseAnn DeMoro, a former leader of a nurse\u2019s union and longtime Sanders surrogate, said \u201cthere are numerous presidents who have had heart problems and heart problems far worse\u201d than what Mr. Sanders experienced Wednesday. Yet many Democratic voters have expressed discomfort with nominating a candidate in their 70s. A Pew survey in May indicated that only 3 percent of Democratic voters believed the best age range for a president to be in was in their 70s. Forty-seven percent of those surveyed said they preferred a president in their 50s. \u201cI\u2019m not an ageist, and I never have been, but as I get older I realize the limitations of getting older, and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine the strain of being president of the United States,\u201d said Steve Horner, 68, a retired special education teacher from Las Vegas who travels with a portable oxygen unit to help him breathe. \u201cI think it does matter,\u201d added Mr. Horner, who said he had not picked a candidate yet. Others acknowledged that age was an issue, but not the pre-eminent one. \u201cWould I prefer someone who is younger? Yes, but it\u2019s not our top thing,\u201d Elizabeth Bennett, 54, said at a gun safety forum in Las Vegas. On the campaign trail, each of the three septuagenarian Democrats has sought to project an image of good health, with Ms. Warren making a point to jog to the stage of her campaign events and Mr. Biden running through parades. The onetime captain of his high school track team, Mr. Sanders has done the same. He has pursued a blistering campaign schedule often characterized by multiple stops a day, and has been loath to take time off from the trail. He pitched in the softball game his campaign staged over the summer on Iowa\u2019s \u201cField of Dreams,\u201d and his aides have released other images of him playing catch or basketball. Mr. Sanders\u2019s events are usually high-energy affairs, where he regales enthusiastic crowds with his calls for \u201cMedicare for all\u201d and rails against the corporate and Washington elite. In recent weeks, he has struggled with hoarseness, which forced him to cancel several events last month, but he then returned to the campaign trail. In March, he hit his head on the edge of a glass shower door, requiring seven stitches. The Sanders campaign had planned to go on air with his first television ads of the campaign this week in Iowa, announcing a two-week $1.3 million buy on Tuesday. His campaign said on Wednesday that it was postponing those ads. The procedure Mr. Sanders had is generally not considered dangerous. Stents are tiny metal tube-shaped cages used to widen arteries in which blood flow has become impeded. They are inserted into coronary arteries when patients are suffering from angina, which is pain that results from clogged vessels, or heart attacks, in which blood flow is completely blocked. Dr. Gilbert Tang, a heart surgeon at the Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, said that if Mr. Sanders\u2019s heart was not damaged, he should make a full recovery. But he also sounded a note of caution, saying the risks depended on which artery was blocked: \u201cWe don\u2019t know what the anatomy looks like and what kind of stent at what location,\u201d he said. During his first presidential run, Mr. Sanders released a letter from his doctor declaring that he was in \u201cvery good health.\u201d The letter stated that Mr. Sanders had suffered several ailments during his life, including gout and diverticulitis. The letter also said Mr. Sanders had normal readings for blood pressure, pulse and blood count and that he had no history of cardiovascular disease.",

      "content": " Senator Bernie Sanders, recovering in a Las Vegas hospital from a procedure to treat a clogged artery, should be able to return home by the end of this weekend and will participate in the next Democratic debate, his wife, Jane Sanders, said Thursday. \u201cBernie is up and about,\u201d Ms. Sanders said in a statement on Thursday. \u201cWe expect Bernie will be discharged and on a plane back to Burlington before the end of the weekend.\u201d Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign has declined to say whether he had suffered a heart attack, and his wife\u2019s statement did not address that. On Wednesday, Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign said he experienced \u201csome chest discomfort\u201d during an event on Tuesday evening; a medical evaluation found blockage in one artery, and two stents were inserted. He has canceled a two-day college tour this week in California, and his aides have not said when he would return to the campaign trail. Placing stents in arteries is a common procedure, and patients generally return home within a day or two. Ms. Sanders did not specify whether Mr. Sanders, 78, would be discharged sooner than the weekend and would remain in Las Vegas before returning home. Dr. Brahmajee Nallamothu, an interventional cardiologist at the University of Michigan, said it is hard to read too much into Mr. Sanders\u2019s apparently prolonged hospital stay. If a blood vessel\u2019s anatomy is complex, he said, cardiologists might keep a patient for an extra day. But a stay of several days, he said, \u201cis not typical unless there is an additional issue.\u201d Dr. Nallamothu said he had watched a video of Mr. Sanders\u2019s event at a Las Vegas restaurant Tuesday night when the senator, looking distressed, removed his jacket and asked for a chair so he could sit down. The symptoms, Dr. Nallamothu said, suggest that Mr. Sanders might have had a small heart attack \u2014 defined as a blockage that results in some damage to the heart muscle \u2014 or almost had a small heart attack. But he does not seem to have had a major one. With a smaller heart attack, a blood vessel is mostly blocked but a trickle of blood can still get through. If the person is sitting still, that can be enough blood to relieve symptoms. But if the person is standing and moving around \u2014 as Mr. Sanders was originally\u2014 the paucity of blood can cause chest pain and discomfort. In her statement, Ms. Sanders, who traveled on Wednesday to Las Vegas and is now with Mr. Sanders as he recovers, said her husband was in a buoyant mood, that doctors were \u201cpleased\u201d with Mr. Sanders\u2019s progress and that he had not needed any additional procedures. Former Senator Harry Reid of Nevada visited Mr. Sanders on Thursday at Desert Springs Hospital Medical Center. In a brief phone interview, Mr. Reid said Mr. Sanders \u201clooked really good.\u201d He said Mr. Sanders had been sitting in a big chair but \u201cjumped right up\u201d when he arrived and that the two spoke for about a half-hour, on topics including health care and his grandson, who works for Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign as a videographer. With Mr. Sanders were his wife; Faiz Shakir, his campaign manager; and Ari Rabin-Havt, a deputy campaign manager, he said. \u201cBernie is not a backslapping joke teller; he\u2019s a very serious man always,\u201d Mr. Reid said. \u201cHe feels good, he smiled.\u201d Internally, the campaign is trying to keep its staff motivated. Two advisers, Nina Turner and Jeff Weaver, led an all-staff conference call on Thursday, a campaign aide said, that appeared aimed at energizing the staff. \u201cWe are not taking our foot off the gas,\u201d Ms. Turner said. Still, the incident is likely to intensify the focus on Mr. Sanders\u2019s age, but also on age generally in the Democratic race, where the three top candidates \u2014 Mr. Sanders, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Elizabeth Warren \u2014 are all in their 70s. But if allies are projecting optimism about his ability to return to the race in full form, the medical episode has cast a shadow over his candidacy just as he was trying to reinvigorate his campaign and prepare for the next debate on Oct. 15. In recent weeks, he has tried to improve his standing in the race by overtly stressing his electability \u2014 an attempt to draw a contrast to Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren, who has continued to surge. On Tuesday, the Sanders campaign trumpeted its $25.3 million third-quarter fund-raising haul as it looked to put its summer woes behind it. Mr. Sanders\u2019s heart trouble, however, could complicate his argument that he is the best positioned to defeat President Trump in the general election. On Wednesday, his campaign said he was postponing a highly-touted $1.3 million television ad buy in Iowa. In an update on Thursday, the campaign said that it would begin airing the ad on Tuesday, and that it would run for two weeks as it had planned. The Sanders campaign\u2019s reluctance to provide much information about his health has also not helped to quell concern. Rebecca Katz, a progressive strategist who is not aligned with any candidate this cycle, said the Sanders campaign should be in \u201crapid response mode and giving out as many answers about Sanders\u2019s health as possible before more questions pile up.\u201d \u201cIf everything is fine,\u201d she said, \u201cThe campaign should be operating as normal.\u201d Since Wednesday, campaign aides have been trying to put the episode in a positive light, with some tweeting and retweeting well-wishes and encouragement. Surrogates and supporters have also expressed their solidarity. Some supporters have leveraged the episode into a rallying cry for fund-raising. Mr. Sanders himself sent out a tweet on Wednesday thanking his well-wishers and using the opportunity to plug \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d The tweet prompted some allies to praise him for being so devoted to his message. The campaign said several surrogates would visit Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina this weekend.",

      "content": "  Bernie Sanders acknowledged on Wednesday that he knew he had suffered a heart attack three days before his campaign released that information, but he defended the decision to keep those details private. Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign had been inundated with questions from the news media last week as he recovered at a hospital in Las Vegas, and speculation about whether he had had a heart attack spread on social media and among voters. Campaign officials waited until Mr. Sanders was released from the hospital on Friday, smiling and waving to news reporters, before disclosing that he had. In an interview with NBC News, Mr. Sanders said a doctor at an urgent care facility in Las Vegas, where he went last Tuesday night after experiencing chest pain, had informed him that he was having a \u201cheart event.\u201d The interviewer then asked if the doctor had said he was having a heart attack, to which Mr. Sanders said, \u201cYeah.\u201d His campaign did not announce that until Friday, saying only that doctors had inserted two stents to open a blocked artery \u2014 a fairly common procedure. A heart attack, known medically as a myocardial infarction, means that there was at least some damage to the heart muscle. Mr. Sanders, 78, rejected the idea that his campaign had showed a lack of transparency in not disclosing the information more quickly. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t accept that. I think that\u2019s a media thing,\u201d he told NBC, adding that his campaign had been trying \u201cto understand what in fact is going on.\u201d \u201cI think we did it appropriately and did it as quickly as we could,\u201d he said. \u201cNo apologies.\u201d His wife, Jane Sanders, said in an interview with The New York Times that she had received the heart attack news on Thursday, and that it was her decision to wait to release that information until her husband was discharged the next day. Mr. Sanders and his family were dealing with another crisis at the same time: the cancer diagnosis of his daughter-in-law, Rain\u00e8 Riggs. Ms. Riggs \u2014 who was married to Mr. Sanders\u2019s son Levi Sanders \u2014 died this weekend at age 46. \u201cI heard it on Thursday,\u201d Ms. Sanders said, referring to her husband\u2019s heart attack. \u201cBut frankly, I wasn\u2019t thinking about the campaign.\u201d Asked in the NBC interview what voters should think with regard to the future of his campaign, Mr. Sanders said: \u201cPeople should think that I had a procedure which hundreds of thousands of people a year have. People should think that according to the doctors, I\u2019m on the way to a full recovery.\u201d",

      "content": " Senator Bernie Sanders had a heart attack this week, his presidential campaign said on Friday as he left a Las Vegas hospital, following three days of near silence from the candidate and his advisers about his health. Mr. Sanders, 78, had entered the hospital on Tuesday night after experiencing chest pain at a campaign event, and doctors had inserted two stents in a blocked artery, a relatively common procedure. But the campaign did not confirm that Mr. Sanders had had a heart attack until Friday, inviting questions about his condition, and his campaign\u2019s transparency, as he remained off the campaign trail this week. Television cameras filmed Mr. Sanders as he left the hospital Friday, waving to onlookers and pumping a fist, then driving off in a sport utility vehicle. He will remain in Las Vegas on Friday night and return to his home in Burlington, Vt., on Saturday, campaign officials said. \u201cAfter two and a half days in the hospital, I feel great, and after taking a short time off, I look forward to getting back to work,\u201d Mr. Sanders said in a statement. While much of the conversation in the Democratic race has centered on issues like health care and student debt, Mr. Sanders\u2019s heart attack is likely to heighten scrutiny on age in a primary where the top candidates are all in their 70s. In addition to Mr. Sanders, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is 76 and Senator Elizabeth Warren is 70. President Trump is 73. But if Mr. Sanders has, until this week, largely avoided questions about his health \u2014 he has projected an image of fitness as a candidate and has maintained a blistering schedule on the campaign trail \u2014 the spotlight is now squarely on him. The ages of the current leaders notwithstanding, many Democratic voters have expressed discomfort with nominating a septuagenarian candidate, a notion that some political strategists say Mr. Sanders\u2019s heart attack is unlikely to dispel. \u201cRunning for president is a physical and emotional trial, and the presidency itself is even more demanding,\u201d said David Axelrod, a former top adviser to President Barack Obama. \u201cWhile we all wish Senator Sanders well, this has to be a big flashing light for him. And given his age, it may be for some voters, as well.\u201d Mr. Sanders began experiencing chest discomfort on Tuesday evening during a grass-roots fund-raiser he was hosting at a Las Vegas restaurant. As he began taking questions from the audience, he asked a campaign aide for a chair. He did not stay much longer at the event, and became visibly uncomfortable in a car afterward, according to two campaign officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive topic. At that point, Mr. Sanders was taken to an urgent care facility, where doctors determined that he should be transferred to a hospital. He was then taken by ambulance to Desert Springs Hospital Medical Center. At the hospital, he was taken immediately to the cardiac catheterization laboratory, where doctors inserted two stents into a blocked artery. By Wednesday, he was talking to his campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, about the campaign. By Thursday, he was walking laps around the hospital hallway, the officials said. His doctors in Las Vegas, Arturo E. Marchand Jr. and Arjun Gururaj, said in a statement that Mr. Sanders\u2019s \u201chospital course was uneventful with good expected progress.\u201d He spent three nights at the hospital and canceled his events and appearances for the week. The campaign released little information during the week about the extent of Mr. Sanders\u2019s heart trouble, fueling speculation about his health. But on Thursday the campaign said he would participate in the next Democratic debate, to be held near Columbus, Ohio, on Oct. 15. A heart attack means that a portion of the heart muscle died, starved of blood when a vessel was blocked, Dr. Gilbert Tang, a heart surgeon at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, said. \u201cThe first question is, how serious was the heart attack? What muscle was damaged and how will that affect the heart\u2019s function?\u201d Dr. Tang said. \u201cIf it was a significant portion of the heart, will that affect the heart\u2019s ability to pump?\u201d If only a small portion of heart muscle was damaged, he added, Mr. Sanders should make a full recovery \u2014 even at 78. These days recovery does not depend on age so much as other medical issues, like lung problems, he said. That does not mean that Mr. Sanders can simply continue as if nothing happened, though. Doctors usually recommend a cardiac rehabilitation program, which is essentially an exercise program in which patients are closely monitored. Such a program, Dr. Tang said, \u201cconditions the heart to work harder.\u201d Mr. Sanders would normally also take a cocktail of drugs to reduce his risk of another heart attack, including powerful anti-clotting medications that require close monitoring for a month, Dr. Tang said. In the 2016 presidential campaign, Mr. Sanders\u2019s doctor said that the senator was \u201cin overall very good health.\u201d His ailments included gout; a mild elevation of cholesterol; an inflammation of out-pouches in the bowel known as diverticulitis; and hormone replacement therapy for an underactive thyroid gland. He had no reported history of heart disease. Among the other candidates, Mr. Biden underwent emergency surgery in 1988 for a near-fatal ruptured berry aneurysm of an artery in his brain. He also underwent surgery to remove a second berry aneurysm. In 2008, Mr. Biden\u2019s doctor said that he had recovered fully. Mr. Trump has not had a medical emergency while running for or serving in office, though he has not released as much medical information to the public as other recent presidents have. This year, the White House physician pronounced Mr. Trump in \u201cvery good health,\u201d although the president had gained weight and is now officially obese. Other presidents and presidential candidates have had heart trouble, though not all of it was known to the public at the time. Experts believe that President Warren G. Harding died of a heart attack that his doctor did not detect. Toward the end of President Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s third term and until his death in his fourth term, his White House doctor withheld the fact that he had serious heart failure. President Dwight D. Eisenhower suffered a heart attack near the end of his first term, and might have had a heart attack before he ran for president. In 1999, former Senator Bill Bradley damaged his presidential campaign by not disclosing that he had had a number of episodes of atrial fibrillation, a heart rhythm abnormality, before he experienced one while campaigning and had to be rushed to a hospital with reporters trailing him. Before his heart attack pulled him from the campaign trail, Mr. Sanders was polling in the top tier of the Democratic primary race with Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren, and his staff has been trying to project optimism about his candidacy. But the episode has cast a shadow over his campaign just as he was attempting to reinvigorate it after a summer slump that saw his standing in some polls slip. Hoping to reverse course, he had recently begun to focus more on his electability, arguing that he is the candidate best positioned to beat Mr. Trump in the general election. The Sanders campaign announced this week that it had raised $25.3 million in the third quarter, placing him ahead of Ms. Warren, his chief ideological rival, by a hair and at the top of the field in fund-raising. In a show of force, the campaign announced a $1.3 million ad buy in Iowa that it then postponed as it waited to assess the situation; the ad will now begin airing next Tuesday, and will run for two weeks as planned. Campaign officials said they would determine when he would return to the trail as he recovers at his home, and it was possible that his first public appearance would be at the debate. His demeanor then will likely be watched closely by both voters and the news media. Already, Mr. Sanders is working against a built-in bias. When asked about age, voters show a clear preference for younger presidential candidates, with an overwhelming majority saying they prefer candidates in their 40s through 60s, according to surveys. When asked about the ideal age for a president, just 3 percent said the 70s, according to polling released by Pew Research Center in May. Other polls have shown that Americans express more discomfort with a candidate in his or her 70s than one who is gay, Muslim or an independent. Bryce Smith, 27, the Democratic Party chair in Dallas County, Iowa, said Mr. Sanders\u2019s health scare could hurt his chances \u2014 particularly against Ms. Warren. \u201cI do see that as something that is going to deter people that were maybe on the fence,\u201d he said. \u201cIf anyone was teetering between Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, this probably showed them that Elizabeth Warren has the stamina and the health and is a little bit younger in age to see it through eight years.\u201d Jill Alper, a Democratic strategist in Michigan and a veteran of Bill Clinton\u2019s and John Kerry\u2019s presidential bids, said voters would be watching Mr. Sanders closely in the next debate. \u201cDoes his energy level change? Does he campaign differently?\u201d she said. \u201cIf he maintains a reasonable energy level, it may not change anything for him.\u201d On Friday evening, after Mr. Sanders was released from the hospital, he dropped off his bags at his hotel and went for a walk in a park with his wife, Jane Sanders. The two were seen holding hands.",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 As Senator Bernie Sanders recuperates from the heart attack he suffered while campaigning last Tuesday in Las Vegas, he will inevitably face questions in the coming days as to whether he will continue his presidential campaign and, if so, at what pace. Let\u2019s start with some facts straightaway. A heart attack does not disqualify anyone from running for and holding public office. Modern medicine enabled Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower and Lyndon B. Johnson and Vice President Dick Cheney to continue in their roles after having suffered heart attacks, as others serving in Congress or state governments have done. (It is important to note that the popular but nonspecific term \u201cheart attack\u201d describes an array of heart problems; one is myocardial infarction, or the death of heart muscle cells, which is what Mr. Sanders had.) By every indication, Mr. Sanders plans to continue his campaign for the presidency, and even told staff members on a telephone call Monday that he feels more \u201cmore strongly about the need for a political revolution today than I did when I began this campaign.\u201d [The latest data and analysis to keep track of who\u2019s leading the race to be the Democratic nominee.] Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., one of the race\u2019s leading candidates, also once faced questions about his ability to serve in public office because of a serious medical problem. In 1988, as a 45-year-old senator from Delaware, he experienced a near fatal rupture of an aneurysm in an artery in his brain. Shortly after his emergency surgery for the aneurysm, he had a second one removed before it could burst. Because new cerebral aneurysms can develop years later in a tiny percentage of individuals, some experts suggested that Mr. Biden be examined for any new aneurysms when Barack Obama selected him as his running mate. At the time, Mr. Biden\u2019s doctor said that he did not need further testing because he had recovered fully and done well for 20 years. Mr. Sanders is certainly not the first candidate whose presidential campaign was disrupted by a medical emergency. In 1999, former Senator Bill Bradley made an unexpected visit to a hospital in the San Francisco Bay Area for atrial fibrillation, a heart rhythm abnormality, which he did not disclose until after the incident. After canceling a few events, Mr. Bradley, now 76, resumed his campaign, but he eventually dropped out of the race after losing the New Hampshire primary. A poll of New Hampshire voters revealed concern about how he had handled the disclosure of his health issue. Still, Mr. Sanders\u2019s case is unusual in many respects: He is a leading candidate recovering from a heart attack at age 78 who must compete in an intensely competitive primary while also holding down a demanding job as senator. Indeed, Mr. Sanders\u2019s disruption comes amid increased pressure to bolster voter support with strong challenges from Mr. Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren, and it is unclear at what pace Mr. Sanders will carry on his campaign. \u201cBernie will be scrutinized very carefully in the next month or two for his ability to come back and campaign as vigorously as he has done in the 2016 and current presidential campaigns,\u201d said Ed Rollins, a former adviser to President Ronald Reagan. \u201cHe\u2019ll be looked at a little differently\u201d for things like being tired at the end of the day or stumbling in his delivery onstage, Mr. Rollins added. \u201cI have never known a politician or big moneyed guy or anyone who has had a first heart attack\u201d not consider his mortality, Mr. Rollins added. Also, Mr. Sanders \u201csurely will think about a running mate.\u201d Based on the health information he and his doctor provided when he ran in 2016, it would not have been possible to predict the Vermont senator\u2019s heart attack last week. At that time, his doctor said that Mr. Sanders was \u201cin overall very good health\u201d and that his ailments included gout, a mild elevation of cholesterol, diverticulitis and an underactive thyroid gland for which he took daily hormone therapy. Tests showed that Mr. Sanders\u2019s thyroid function and electrocardiogram tests were normal and that he had no reported history of heart disease. It is not known whether Mr. Sanders has had a full medical checkup since then. Over the long term, however, \u201colder patients are at higher risk of recurrent cardiac events after a heart attack,\u201d said Dr. Christopher P. Cannon, a cardiologist at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston. \u201cBut Mr. Sanders appears to have few cardiac risk factors like high blood pressure and diabetes.\u201d He pointed to data from a series of his team\u2019s published studies that showed a one-in-five chance within five years after a first heart attack that a second one, or even stroke or death, might occur. But such population-based statistics provide general odds and cannot necessarily be applied to an individual. \u201cVery few illnesses would preclude someone from holding high office,\u201d said Dr. Jonathan S. Reiner, a cardiologist at George Washington University Hospital in Washington, who treated Mr. Cheney for serious heart disease for many years before, during and after his two terms in office. \u201cBut the public has a right to know the salient details because the ailment or treatment can affect how the candidate performs in office.\u201d Although there are legal protections to keep health information confidential, most candidates seeking the presidency in recent years have responded to the public demand to know and have waived that privilege. \u201cThe public should have sufficient facts to understand the magnitude of the event and the near- and long-term prognosis for the candidate,\u201d Dr. Reiner said. \u201cMr. Sanders\u2019s campaign has released too few details to understand the medical impact of the heart attack on his health.\u201d Not all heart attacks, for example, are of the same dimension. Like Mr. Sanders, three other presidential candidates are also septuagenarians. Mr. Biden will be 77 next month and Ms. Warren is 70. All three have said they will release their medical records before the Iowa caucuses that begin in February, although Mr. Sanders\u2019s incident last week may push his top rivals to disclose their records sooner. Then there is President Trump, who is 73. He has not said whether he would release any health information before or after his third presidential medical checkup, which is expected in early 2020. While presidents are not required to have medical checkups or release findings if they have one, Mr. Trump released a detailed summary after his first presidential exam and a less detailed one after his second, earlier this year.",

      "content": " When Bernie Sanders ran for president in 2016, his campaign was strikingly pro-labor. He proposed a $15-an-hour minimum wage, which was much further than most mainstream Democrats, including Hillary Clinton, were willing to go. He denounced a trans-Pacific trade deal that was anathema to many unions. He endorsed an organizing method, known as card check, that would allow workers to unionize without holding a secret-ballot election. Yet by the standards of the race for the 2020 Democratic nomination, the Bernie Sanders of four years ago was something of a piker. At least half the candidates who will appear in next week\u2019s presidential debate \u2014 including Mr. Sanders \u2014 have labor platforms that are more ambitious than his 2016 version. Several candidates have pledged to ban noncompete agreements, which hold down wages for workers, and mandatory-arbitration clauses, which prohibit lawsuits against employers. They would effectively require many companies to treat independent contractors as employees, making the workers eligible for the minimum wage and unemployment insurance. They would enact a number of measures that would help workers unionize and strike, like allowing them to lead boycotts of an employer\u2019s customers, which is currently illegal. \u201cFor the first time we see really robust agendas in labor and employment policy that are about unions and also about really high labor standards,\u201d said Lawrence Mishel, the former president of the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank. \u201cPoliticians have been willing to say some of this stuff, but they haven\u2019t been public about it.\u201d Perhaps the most ambitious proposal is an idea known as sectoral bargaining, in which workers would bargain with employers on an industrywide basis rather than employer by employer. Sectoral bargaining, which is common in Europe, would make it possible to increase wages and benefits for millions of workers in relatively short order, even for those who aren\u2019t union members. It would also give employers an incentive to create better-paying jobs because doing so would no longer bestow a major cost advantage on competitors. Under a sectoral bargaining system, unions or worker groups would have to show support from a certain share of workers in order to begin negotiating on their behalf \u2014 for example, by getting 15 or 20 percent of workers in an industry to sign cards. At that point, a federal agency like the Labor Department would convene the bargaining, with employer groups on one side and the worker groups on the other. The agency would review any resulting agreement, which, once approved, would become binding on all employers in the industry. In recent months, Mr. Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, along with Pete Buttigieg, Cory Booker and Beto O\u2019Rourke, have released labor plans that would either enact sectoral bargaining or take significant strides in that direction by allowing workers to negotiate with multiple employers at once. That such a range of Democratic candidates have signed on to far-reaching labor proposals reflects the ways that lackluster wage growth, economic insecurity and widening inequality are upending politics and shattering a longstanding policy consensus. In the early stages of the economic recovery a decade ago, most workers were primarily concerned with avoiding unemployment, said Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster who has conducted research on voters\u2019 economic concerns. But as the expansion has plodded on, the focus has shifted from having any job to having a good job, which workers see as rare. \u201cYou\u2019re really trying to do something about what jobs pay,\u201d Ms. Lake said. With people increasingly open to more radical tools for accomplishing this, joining a union can seem downright middle of the road. According to recent polling by Pew Research Center, 42 percent of Americans view socialism favorably, up from 29 percent in 2010. During roughly that same time, support for unions has climbed significantly, from less than half to about two-thirds of Americans. The increased openness to unions and collective bargaining has dovetailed with a palpable shift in expert opinion. For decades, economists tended to play down the importance of unions, attributing much of the increase in income inequality to a growing demand for skilled workers that resulted from automation and the spread of information technology. Some otherwise liberal economists were skeptical or even hostile to unions, seeing them as cartels that drove up wages for their members at the cost of reducing employment. \u201cI learned this in graduate school in macro \u2014 anti-union stuff from people who were highly inclined toward government redistribution,\u201d said the economist and columnist Noah Smith, who earned his Ph.D. at the University of Michigan and has written about economists\u2019 suspicion of unions. \u201cThere was this definite anti-union bias among liberals in the economics profession.\u201d But in recent years, many economists have begun to reconsider those views. Partly this reflects a broader ideological shift in the country away from the market-friendly policy approach of the 1980s and \u201990s, which has lost credibility as inequality has widened. \u201cWe as social scientists live in a society where clearly the general social and political environment affects the questions we ask,\u201d said Arindrajit Dube, a labor economist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. And partly this reflects a proliferation of research, which some of the campaigns have specifically cited, showing that employers have considerable power to hold down wages below the level the market would set. Whatever the case, there appears to be a growing consensus among center-left economists that unions are a critical check on the tendency of capital to vacuum up the gains from economic growth. A recent paper by economists at Princeton and Columbia showed that unions raised wages for low-skilled workers in the decades in which inequality was narrowing and concluded that unions have \u201chad a significant, equalizing effect on the income distribution.\u201d A recent paper by the centrist Hamilton Project concluded that \u201cunions lift wages, reduce inequality, and shape how work is organized.\u201d And then there is the growing consensus among union experts, including labor leaders, that improving workers\u2019 standards of living after decades of declining unionization requires a much more ambitious approach than the movement previously embraced. Before the 2004 and 2008 presidential elections, the politically powerful Service Employees International Union told candidates that they would have to present a detailed health care proposal to be considered for its endorsement. This year, the union asked candidates seeking its support to produce specific plans to help underpaid workers act collectively and urged them to incorporate industrywide bargaining as a key pillar. Other union experts have helped to deliver this message behind the scenes. Larry Cohen, a former president of the Communications Workers of America and a top volunteer adviser to Mr. Sanders in 2016 and now, said that he has been touting the importance of sectoral bargaining to Mr. Sanders in recent years. \u201cThe last time I talked to him about this was right before he decided to run,\u201d said Mr. Cohen, who looked closely at sectoral bargaining systems in Norway and Argentina while traveling to those countries after the last election. \u201cHe was genuinely excited by it.\u201d Mr. Cohen has also been involved in an effort by two faculty members at Harvard Law School, known as the Clean Slate for Worker Power project, to convene dozens of labor experts, activists and organizers to reimagine labor law from the ground up. The group won\u2019t publish its recommendations until January, but in the meantime it has worked to disseminate ideas like sectoral bargaining across the campaigns. Sharon Block and Benjamin Sachs, the Harvard faculty members involved, have weighed in with several campaigns that have embraced this approach, according to aides to Ms. Warren, Mr. Buttigieg, Mr. O\u2019Rourke and Mr. Booker. Ms. Block, a former Obama administration official and congressional staff member who is a veteran of legislative efforts to make unionizing and collective bargaining easier, said experience had taught her that advancing labor interests through provisions like card check doesn\u2019t work: Such measures tend to be too small to matter substantively, and they fail to generate political excitement among those who would benefit. \u201cThe folks who don\u2019t want this to happen will fight just as hard whether it\u2019s small or big,\u201d Ms. Block said. \u201cBut doing something bigger makes moving legislation easier because you have the potential to have a much bigger constituency behind it.\u201d",

      "content": " Senator Bernie Sanders raised $25.3 million in the past three months, his campaign said on Tuesday, a total that continues to demonstrate his strength with small donors as he fights to maintain support in key early-voting states. The financial haul, among the first that a candidate has announced for the third quarter, will place Mr. Sanders in the top tier of the field for fund-raising. It is also a much-needed boost for his campaign, as it looks to move past a summer slump that coincided with staff shake-ups in New Hampshire and Iowa and a slip in some polls in early-voting states. And it will perhaps help quell the narrative that his campaign is in decline. Mr. Sanders received 1.4 million donations in the third quarter, his campaign said. His third-quarter dollar total exceeds the $18 million he raised in the second quarter, which was roughly the same amount he collected during the first six weeks of his campaign at the beginning of the year. His campaign did not say how much cash it had on hand. Mr. Sanders announced his total for the quarter just minutes after Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., said he had raised $19.1 million in the same period. The fund-raising announcement comes as Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign begins a crucial phase of his presidential bid. He and his advisers had tried for months to portray the race as a battle between Mr. Sanders and Joseph R. Biden Jr., but the surge of Ms. Warren, his chief ideological rival, has scrambled that strategy. The top tier of candidates in the field has narrowed faster than his advisers expected, complicating matters: Rather than competing for the nomination with a half dozen candidates, he is essentially battling just two right now \u2014 Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren. Seeking to alter the course of the race, Mr. Sanders has shifted his message in recent weeks to focus more on electability. During a recent tour of eastern Iowa and campaign stops elsewhere, he has tried to make the case to voters that of all the Democratic hopefuls, he is the candidate most likely to prevail against President Trump. He has also introduced a series of audacious policy proposals, including establishing a national rent control standard, eliminating existing medical debt and instituting a wealth tax that goes farther than Ms. Warren\u2019s plan. Yet perhaps more than ever, Mr. Sanders is betting on the grass-roots appeal that propelled his 2016 campaign, a factor that his campaign says polls often fail to capture. Rather than relying on high-dollar fund-raisers \u2014 events he categorically rejects \u2014 he instead hopes to energize enthusiastic supporters who can donate to him again and again. In a show of force last month, his campaign said it had logged contributions from more than one million individual donors. His campaign said the average donation for the quarter was $18.07. His strategy means he does not have to worry about donors maxing out; his campaign said more than 99.9 percent can give again. But it also poses challenges: Though he has a loyal army of supporters and volunteers, many of them do not donate large amounts of money, meaning he must appeal to a huge pool of donors in order to keep pace with rivals like Mr. Buttigieg, who is willing to collect large sums of money on the traditional big donor fund-raising circuit.",

      "author": "Matt Stevens",
      "content": "  It was another busy week in Washington and on the campaign trail. Here is our quick rundown of what happened in the 2020 race. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont had a heart attack this week, and doctors inserted two stents to open a blocked artery. Mr. Sanders, 78, was taken to a Las Vegas hospital on Wednesday after he experienced \u201csome chest discomfort\u201d at an event Tuesday night. His wife, Jane Sanders, later said that he was resting comfortably and that he would participate in the next Democratic debate, on Oct. 15. The news that he\u2019d had a heart attack was not revealed until he was discharged from the hospital on Friday. The end of the third fiscal quarter was Monday, and candidates have started announcing their fund-raising totals for July, August and September. We\u2019re tracking the numbers here. Our colleague Reid J. Epstein wrote about the last-minute email scramble for donations. (Meet our goal! Save the kittens!) Here\u2019s where some of the candidates ended up: President Trump\u2019s re-election campaign and the Republican National Committee raised a combined $125 million in the third quarter. Of course, the numbers aren\u2019t directly comparable to the Democratic hauls, since each donor can give hundreds of thousands of dollars to the R.N.C., but only $5,600 to an individual candidate. On Wednesday, Mr. Biden delivered his most forceful response yet to Mr. Trump\u2019s requests that foreign countries investigate unsubstantiated allegations about him and his son Hunter. He accused the Trump team of trying to use \u201clies, smears, distortions and name calling\u201d to knock him out of the presidential race. Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign also contacted television anchors and networks on Sunday to \u201cdemand\u201d that Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, be kept off the air for promoting \u201cfalse, debunked conspiracy theories.\u201d Ms. Harris, for her part, called (in a tweet and more formally in a letter) on Twitter to suspend Mr. Trump\u2019s account for what she said was harassment of the whistle-blower, a violation of the platform\u2019s terms of service. It\u2019s official: The next Democratic debate will feature a dozen candidates onstage at once. As we\u2019ve mentioned before, the Oct. 15 debate in Ohio will feature the 10 candidates who appeared at last month\u2019s event as well as Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii and Tom Steyer, the former hedge fund investor. In the world of not-so-surprising news, we learned on Tuesday that Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, is not a fan of Ms. Warren\u2019s plan to \u201cbreak up big tech.\u201d \u201cIf she gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg told Facebook employees, according to recordings leaked to The Verge. Suffice it to say, there were more remarks where those came from, and Ms. Warren offered some of her own: Facebook, she said, had repeatedly fumbled its \u201cresponsibility to protect our democracy.\u201d Nine of the 2020 candidates appeared at a gun policy forum in Las Vegas on Wednesday, two years and one day after a gunman massacred 58 concertgoers there, and expressed their collective support for sweeping new gun restrictions. Gun control once splintered Democrats along regional and ideological lines, but the party is increasingly unified around an assault weapons ban, gun licensing and other measures. Before the event, both Mr. Biden (who participated) and Mr. Steyer (who wasn\u2019t invited) released gun control plans. On Monday, Mr. Sanders unveiled another proposal aimed at reducing income inequality: a corporate tax that would penalize the country\u2019s largest companies if they don\u2019t narrow the gap between what they pay their top executives and what they pay their workers. Two days later, Ms. Warren outlined a new tax on \u201cexcessive lobbying,\u201d which would apply to corporations and trade organizations that spend more than $500,000 a year lobbying the government. When \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d does an entire skit on a Democratic debate, all the time you\u2019ve spent trying to keep up with this clown-car primary can suddenly seem worth it. Enjoy the \u201ccorn pop\u201d story, Maya Rudolph\u2019s portrayal of Ms. Harris, and this very good tweet from Ms. Harris herself.",
