      "content": " LOS ANGELES \u2014 At an auditorium here one evening this week, Atticus Tyagi, age 8, stepped onstage with a canvas bag nearly as large as he is, bearing the name of his \u201cGammy\u201d \u2014 Senator Elizabeth Warren \u2014 and calmly chose raffle tickets to determine who in the audience of thousands would have a chance to ask Ms. Warren a question. Last month, donors dined on salmon and kale salad while listening to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. in Brentwood. Two days later, some of the same guests returned to the same home to listen to a similar speech from their own senator, Kamala Harris. Ms. Harris may be California\u2019s homegrown candidate, but the other Democratic candidates are clearly not conceding the state as her turf. In July, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., spoke in a San Francisco warehouse, and Senator Bernie Sanders pressed the case for \u201cMedicare for all\u201d in Hollywood and Little Tokyo. This week, Senator Cory Booker showed up in South Los Angeles for a discussion on gun violence. And this weekend, more than a dozen presidential candidates will speak to the party faithful in San Francisco for a Democratic National Committee meeting. With a deep base of wealthy donors, California has long been treated as a political A.T.M. In 2020 it will become something else too: an early voting state. Or closer to one than it has been since 2008. As soon as next February, voters here can begin casting early ballots to determine how the state\u2019s nearly 500 Democratic delegates \u2014 more than any other state in the country \u2014 will be divvied up in the nominating contest. The primary itself is March 3, Super Tuesday, and because California is not a winner-take-all state, campaigns are eager to compete for any number of delegates from the state. \u201cI think we love being the popular girl or boy at the dance right now,\u201d said Eric Garcetti, the mayor of Los Angeles who considered his own presidential bid and has longstanding relationships with several candidates. Mr. Garcetti said that candidates have long come to California to raise money, but not to court voters. Or, in school dance terms: \u201cHistorically, people want us to pay for the dance, but nobody wants to dance with us. Now, suddenly we\u2019re able to hit the floor.\u201d Since Ms. Harris announced her candidacy with a large rally in Oakland, her campaign has put considerable effort into lining up endorsements from elected officials at every level up and down the state, including Gov. Gavin Newsom. She also continues to raise millions from her local supporters, holding half a dozen fund-raisers in the span of one July weekend. Ian Sams, a spokesman for the Harris campaign, said that it views California as a huge opportunity for Ms. Harris, and a place where she does have an advantage. But the campaign has also made clear that it needs to spend significant money to defend that advantage. If Ms. Harris were to lose on her home turf, it would most likely spell the end of her candidacy. This week, the campaign announced it had hired several new staff members to work in Los Angeles and Oakland. The campaign has also been focused on earning statewide endorsements, though some of the state\u2019s most prominent officials, including Mr. Garcetti and former Gov. Jerry Brown, have so far not backed a single candidate. \u201cOf course we have familiarity, respect and affection for our own senator, but we are too big and too diverse of a state to move with one parochial mind,\u201d Mr. Garcetti said in an interview. Mr. Brown, who remains one of the most popular politicians in the state, said that candidates should do more than \u201cthe obverse to the rightward tilt\u201d from Republicans, no matter how angry Democratic voters may seem. Mr. Brown, who lost his own bid for president, declined to comment on any of the candidates specifically, including Ms. Harris, whom he has known for decades. \u201cTrump is not popular here, that is an understatement, but after a while, when it\u2019s only attacks on Trump, that doesn\u2019t feel like there\u2019s much substance there,\u201d Mr. Brown said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s a very thin debate right now, as I see it, and for many Californians, and I\u2019m sure many Americans, it\u2019s not all that interesting.\u201d While Ms. Harris has consistently been one of the top candidates in several polls of California voters, Mr. Biden has repeatedly surpassed her, and Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren are each within a few points. Officials from several campaigns said they were just beginning to hire staff members in California, but planned to open offices in multiple regions of the state, acknowledging that what works in Silicon Valley, where voters skew wealthy and white, may be very different from the Central Valley, which is heavily Latino and more conservative. At a Warren event, a campaign staff member actively recruited Spanish-speaking volunteers. While the Warren campaign has so far hired just one staff member to oversee the state, officials say they have amassed thousands of volunteers here, and Ms. Warren plans to hold events in the state almost monthly. Her children and grandchildren live in Los Angeles, which leads to some travel efficiency: After the state Democratic convention in San Francisco last month, Ms. Warren flew south to attend her granddaughter\u2019s high school graduation. Mr. Sanders also has a sizable infrastructure to fall back on from the 2016 Democratic primary, when he captured 46 percent of the vote in California. The campaign recently hired a statewide coordinator who will oversee an expansive operation. His California supporters are a receptive group: Hundreds of people lined up in scorching afternoon heat to attend a health care town hall he held in Little Tokyo, just east of downtown Los Angeles. \u201cAll the issues we wish everyone was talking about, that some other candidates are starting to talk about now, he\u2019s been talking about them forever,\u201d said Alex Perez, a 42-year-old military veteran who lives in the San Fernando Valley and had come to see Mr. Sanders speak. \u201cOur own senator, I like her, yes, but she is playing catch-up.\u201d Mr. Perez\u2019s attitude \u2014 appreciative of Senator Harris, but enthusiastic about other options \u2014 was a sentiment that dozens of voters expressed, to varying degrees, during a summer of plentiful opportunities to see candidates. They also noted that they were trying to make sense of how Ms. Harris\u2019s positions had shifted over her 15 years in public office, and what she really believed. But mostly, they were excited to get a small taste of what Iowa voters have gotten for years: a chance to see the presidential hopefuls for themselves. And they did have several chances. On one busy day in July, Mr. Sanders taped an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel and then headed to the Montalban Theater in Hollywood, where he took the stage after the crowd warmed up to a thumping D.J. set. Across town, Mr. Buttigieg was holding his own fund-raiser with celebrity hosts that included Ellen DeGeneres and Chelsea Handler. A day earlier, Mr. Buttigieg attracted a couple of hundred Bay Area supporters to an industrial section of San Francisco, for a fund-raiser that featured a panel discussion on diversity and the tech industry. There, he received huge applause after promising to solve homelessness, one of the most pressing and vexing problems in California. When he spoke of homes in South Bend selling for $40,000, he was met with roaring laughter. Whether California Democrats are looking for a moderate would-be peacemaker or an unapologetic liberal may prove to be the central question of the primary here. Carolina Rojas, 44, was eager to bring her 9-year-old daughter to Ms. Warren\u2019s event on Wednesday in Los Angeles. It was just the second day of fourth grade for Valentina, who stood in line for more than an hour to ask Ms. Warren about global warming and how she handled self-doubt. Ms. Rojas was leaning toward Ms. Warren, and newly focused on how important this election will be. \u201cI\u2019ve really come to see that every issue I care about is connected and we really need big changes,\u201d she said. \u201cEl Paso showed us you can\u2019t really tease out gun control from immigration and from racism.\u201d Representative Harley Rouda, a Democrat who captured a long-held Republican seat last year and has become a vocal supporter of impeaching President Trump, said he was most focused on a candidate who could beat Mr. Trump in swing states, and worried that candidates were taking positions that would alienate voters. \u201cI think it\u2019s very important that we not go so far to the left that we lose the strength we achieved in 2018 \u2014 that was not because we made blue districts bluer, it was because we turned red districts blue,\u201d Mr. Rouda said, adding that he was unsure whether he would endorse anyone in the primary. \u201cWe did that in a place like Orange County because people want to see a pragmatic approach, not more bickering.\u201d",

      "author": "Matt Stevens",
      "content": " Here\u2019s our quick weekly catch-up on the presidential campaign and the rapidly shrinking Democratic field. That\u2019s right \u2014 there are now only 21 candidates for the nomination. Late Wednesday night, Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington went on MSNBC and said that he would withdraw from the presidential race. Mr. Inslee had devoted his campaign to raising the alarm about climate change and pulled out of the primary just hours after he unveiled the sixth and final piece of a 200-page plan to address the issue. Though Mr. Inslee had attracted more than 130,000 donors, he had failed to gain traction in the polls and was unlikely to qualify for the next Democratic debate. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be the president,\u201d Mr. Inslee conceded. He announced shortly after that he would seek a third term as governor. Mr. Inslee drew an outpouring of praise this week for spotlighting climate issues with his candidacy. He spoke with my colleague Lisa Friedman about the attention he received immediately after exiting the race. \u201cTo start with zero national name recognition, it\u2019s gratifying to hear people say these things,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m actually more convinced than I was two days ago that the public, or at least those who were paying attention to this issue, recognize that we were able to move the ball down the field.\u201d John Hickenlooper, the former Colorado governor who ended his presidential campaign last week, announced on Thursday morning that he would run for a Senate seat in his home state. Mr. Hickenlooper was resistant to the idea of running for the Senate while he was still in the presidential race, but discussions about a bid grew serious in recent weeks as his campaign faded. Mr. Hickenlooper will seek to challenge Senator Cory Gardner, a Republican, in a contest that Democrats view as a must-win if they have any hope of flipping the Senate in 2020. A day later, Representative Seth Moulton of Massachusetts, a third-term congressman who focused his campaign on national security, announced he too would end his bid for the Democratic nomination for president. Despite campaigning for months, Mr. Moulton, 40, never gained traction with the electorate. He failed to earn even 1 percent support in any of the dozens of polls that would have helped qualify him for the debates. In an interview with my colleague Alex Burns, he argued that if Democrats embraced an overly liberal platform, it would be harder to defeat President Trump. \u201cI think it\u2019s evident that this is now a three-way race between Biden, Warren and Sanders, and really it\u2019s a debate about how far left the party should go,\u201d Mr. Moulton said. Several 2020 Democrats paid a visit to Sioux City, Iowa, on Monday and Tuesday to take part in a presidential forum on Native American issues and explain how they planned to uplift Native communities. The two-day forum was hosted by Four Directions, a Native American voting rights group, and the Native Organizers Alliance. Among the candidates who took part: Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former housing secretary; Senator Kamala Harris of California; Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota; Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont; and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. Ms. Klobuchar announced that she had received the endorsements of three Native American leaders and outlined several policy priorities, including bolstering communication between tribal officials and federal agencies, pushing for the passage of legislation that would address violence against Native American women and girls and connecting every household to the internet by 2022. Ms. Harris also picked up an endorsement, pledged to support the right of tribal self-governance, and promised to increase communication with tribal leaders as president. \u201cThere is work we need to do,\u201d she said via live-streamed video, \u201cthat is about not only restoring tribal land but also acknowledging the historical trauma that has resulted from those many years of violence and, frankly, crimes.\u201d The forum gave Ms. Warren with an opportunity to issue a direct, public apology for her past claims of Native American ancestry. \u201cI know that I have made mistakes,\u201d said Ms. Warren, who was met with a standing ovation when she took the stage. \u201cI am sorry for harm I have caused. I have listened and I have learned a lot, and I am grateful for the many conversations that we\u2019ve had together.\u201d Ms. Warren released a plan last week outlining how she would empower tribal nations. Mr. Castro released his own plan for indigenous communities late last month. Mr. Sanders released a plan to strengthen workers\u2019 rights on Wednesday in Iowa and unveiled his own version of the \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d on Thursday in California. The labor plan, which Mr. Sanders discussed at the Iowa AFL-CIO convention, seeks to double union membership, raise wages and strengthen the middle class. Mr. Sanders said he would guarantee that all workers had the right to unionize and ensure that the National Labor Relations Board would certify unions if a simple majority of workers were in favor of forming one. He also promised to repeal the \u201cRight to Work\u201d provision, ban the practice of permanently replacing striking workers and establish federal protections against the firing of workers for any reason other than \u201cjust cause.\u201d Mr. Sanders outlined his plan to combat climate change the next day in Paradise, Calif., the site of a massive wildfire that killed 85 people last fall. It amounted to a $16.3 trillion blueprint, the most expensive proposal from the field so far. The plan declares climate change a national emergency and calls for the United States to eliminate fossil fuel use by 2050. It envisions building new solar, wind and geothermal power sources across the country, and it commits $200 billion to help poor nations cope with climate change. Mr. Sanders said his proposal would \u201cpay for itself\u201d over 15 years and create 20 million jobs in the process. My colleagues analyzed the campaign rally playlists for nine Democratic candidates and President Trump. As it turns out, the music they chose tells you a lot about their values, their political messages, and their \u201creal\u201d selves. Can you tell Elizabeth Warren and her doppelg\u00e4nger apart? Ms. Warren was at a town hall in Saint Paul, Minn., this week when she met Stephanie Oyen \u2014 a local resident who arrived in a blue blazer and clear glasses. If you can\u2019t figure out who\u2019s who, don\u2019t fret \u2014 many people at the event couldn\u2019t either. \u201cIt got weird very fast,\u201d Ms. Oyen, above left, told the Minneapolis Star Tribune, adding that she eventually ditched her costume and \u201chid behind a tall guy\u201d because she felt bad about causing confusion.",

      "author": "Jonathan Martin",
      "content": " SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 When Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts addressed a few hundred donors last week at a fund-raiser for the Democratic National Committee, she called for \u201cbig, structural change\u201d and hurled her familiar populist lightning bolts at the forces of concentrated wealth. But Ms. Warren did not attend the event just to recite her stump speech. She had another, more tailored message for the Democratic check writers, state party leaders and committee members who were gathered at the elegant Fairmont San Francisco. \u201cLast year, I was running for re-election, but I didn\u2019t hold back,\u201d she said, reminding attendees that in the midterms she had helped more than 160 congressional candidates and nearly 20 hopefuls in governors\u2019 races. \u201cIn fact, I raised or gave more than $11 million helping get Democrats elected up and down the ballot around the country\u201d and \u201csent contributions to all 50 state parties, the national committees and the redistricting fight.\u201d Her point was easy to grasp: While her liberal agenda may be further left than some in the Democratic establishment would prefer, she is a team player who is seeking to lead the party \u2014 not stage a hostile takeover of it. As Ms. Warren steadily rises in the polls she is working diligently to protect her left flank, lining up with progressives on nearly every issue and trying to defuse potential attacks from supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. \u201cI\u2019m with Bernie,\u201d she responds when asked about what is perhaps the most contentious issue of the primary race: \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d Yet publicly, and even more in private, she is signaling to party leaders that, far from wanting to stage a \u201cpolitical revolution\u201d in the fashion of Mr. Sanders, she wants to revive the beleaguered Democratic National Committee and help recapture the Senate while retaining the House in 2020. In phone calls, text messages and small gatherings before her rallies, as well as in one-on-one meetings over hot tea at her Washington condominium, Ms. Warren is simultaneously courting and assuring Democratic town leaders, statewide officials and the chiefs of the country\u2019s largest unions. The outreach is not just an effort to avoid the confrontational approach Mr. Sanders took in 2016, when he inveighed against party insiders and the committee itself, which he correctly believed was favoring Hillary Clinton. Ms. Warren is also trying to allay concerns among Democrats that, as a progressive candidate proposing sweeping change, she may not have enough mainstream appeal to compete with President Trump in the general election. Most of the other White House contenders are, of course, also wooing party officials. But the more establishment-aligned candidates like former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Kamala Harris of California do not face the same questions about their visions for party politics. And interviews with about two dozen Democrats who have been in contact with Ms. Warren reveal that her style of courtship has been unusually determined. Troy Price, the chairman of Iowa\u2019s Democratic Party, said Ms. Warren called him the day he was re-elected to his post last year, immediately after the midterm elections and on the day she entered the race. \u201cAll of the sudden the cellphone is ringing and it\u2019s her \u2014 not a staffer,\u201d added J. David Cox, the president of the American Federation of Government Employees, calling Ms. Warren \u201cthe most aggressive\u201d of the Democratic contenders in pursuing him. Ms. Warren\u2019s wooing could prove important should the nominating contest deadlock at the Democratic National Convention next summer: Many of the officials she is courting are so-called superdelegates, who are able to cast a binding vote should the primary go beyond a first ballot. Beyond the potential electoral advantages, the relationships Ms. Warren is cultivating could prove just as powerful for symbolic purposes. While in San Francisco, Ms. Warren met privately with Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, who in 2016 was one of Ms. Clinton\u2019s most outspoken supporters in the labor movement. Ms. Warren and Ms. Weingarten have developed a close relationship, frequently talking about education issues, and Ms. Weingarten recalled how the senator reached out to her with encouraging words when her union sued Betsy DeVos, the education secretary, over a student loan forgiveness program. Then there is Representative Ra\u00fal Grijalva of Arizona, who was Mr. Sanders\u2019s first congressional supporter in the 2016 election but who is now backing Ms. Warren. So is Representative Deb Haaland of New Mexico, who last year became one of the first Native American women elected to Congress. Ms. Haaland attended the San Francisco fund-raiser, sporting a Warren lapel pin, just a few days after she introduced and defended Ms. Warren at a forum dedicated to Native American issues in Iowa. After being sharply criticized from the right and the left for claiming Native American ancestry, Ms. Warren has apologized and taken down a 2018 video from her campaign website in which she trumpeted the results of a DNA test examining her heritage. Ms. Haaland said that Ms. Warren helped raise money for her campaign last year and that the two had met in the senator\u2019s office and over tea in Ms. Warren\u2019s condominium this year. \u201cWe\u2019re friends, we text each other,\u201d said the congresswoman, noting that she and Ms. Warren were also working together on legislation to establish universal child care and to provide resources to Native Americans. While Ms. Warren has been careful to avoid directly criticizing Mr. Sanders, her regular references to being a capitalist withstanding, she is also quietly taking steps within the party to make clear that she does not want to create a competing power base should she become president. She was one of the first Democratic candidates to sign a pledge circulated last month by the Association of State Democratic Committees vowing not to create any parallel political or organizing infrastructure that would compete with the national or state Democratic parties. The same pledge, which was shared by a Democratic official, also includes a promise \u201cto share all of my data collected during the presidential campaign with the D.N.C. and with state parties.\u201d The state leaders were trying to ensure that the eventual nominee would turn over his or her fund-raising list and any voter file that was compiled for future races. More broadly, they also wanted to ensure that the nominee\u2019s political organization is housed within the architecture of the party. This was done partly out of concern over Mr. Sanders, who has refused to share his 2016 supporter list with the party. (The senator\u2019s aides are quick to note that he has raised nearly $10 million for Democratic candidates and committees dating to his first presidential bid.) But party leaders are just as concerned about the actions of former President Barack Obama: The Democratic National Committee wants to ensure that its nominee has no designs on creating a competing political entity in the mold of Mr. Obama\u2019s Organizing for America, which aimed to push his agenda as president. Many Democrats fault it for weakening the party infrastructure because it diverted money and focus from the committee. Ms. Warren\u2019s outreach, though, extends well beyond the committee. Armed with call sheets compiled by her staff, the senator spends much of her time in transit on her phone, dialing up lawmakers, local party leaders and liberal activists. If she is not talking on the phone, she is often texting or writing personal notes. Claire Celsi, an Iowa state senator who has said she is considering supporting Ms. Warren and Ms. Harris, recalled receiving a note and an inscribed copy of Ms. Warren\u2019s book \u201cThis Fight Is Our Fight\u201d this year. Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign events often begin out of public view, when she meets with a small groups of Democratic officials in gatherings, called \u201cclutches,\u201d for pictures and a few minutes of conversation. While the size of her crowd last week in St. Paul \u2014 roughly 12,000, her campaign said \u2014 drew headlines and attention on social media, her meeting beforehand with a few state lawmakers may have been even more memorable for them. That was the case for Lisa DeMio, the chairwoman of the Democratic town committee in Hampstead, N.H., who met with Ms. Warren before the senator\u2019s town-hall-style meeting in Derry last month. \u201cIt was a little more intimate,\u201d said Ms. DeMio, adding that, while she cannot officially endorse in her capacity as chairwoman, Ms. Warren is her first choice personally. There are other Democrats like Ms. DeMio who can\u2019t, or probably won\u2019t, endorse Ms. Warren but who nevertheless have been on the receiving end of her personal touch. The senator has emailed with Tom Vilsack, a former Iowa governor and agriculture secretary who has a longstanding relationship with Mr. Biden, to ask about agricultural policy, according to Democrats familiar with their exchanges. Gilda Cobb-Hunter, a state representative in South Carolina, said even though she had made clear that she would not endorse in the primary race, Ms. Warren had reached out to her several times. \u201cShe\u2019s persistent but not pushy \u2014 she doesn\u2019t do the real hard sell,\u201d Ms. Cobb-Hunter said. \u201cHer staff does the soft follow up.\u201d \n\nThat is sure to happen again next week, when Ms. Warren heads to South Carolina State University for a town-hall-style meeting as a guest of one of the university\u2019s most famous graduates, Representative James E. Clyburn, to discuss a bill they have jointly introduced related to student loan debt. Mr. Clyburn has long been an ally of Mr. Biden.",

HerndonPRINT EDITIONAugust 28, 2019",
      "author": "Astead W. Herndon",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Tuesday pressed his case that he is the \u201cmost electable\u201d Democratic presidential nominee, saying that while his primary rivals may draw large crowds in urban centers or excite young progressives, he retains the most racially diverse coalition of supporters. The argument, bolstered by Mr. Biden\u2019s strong poll numbers among black voters, accentuates the central thesis of his candidacy: that he is the Democrat most capable of beating President Trump. It also comes as the Democratic field has winnowed in recent weeks, with some polls showing the race as increasingly a battle of three candidates \u2014 the more moderate Mr. Biden and the race\u2019s two progressive New England senators, Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. [Here\u2019s the latest data on who\u2019s leading the race to be the Democratic nominee.] With that new landscape coming into focus, and with Mr. Biden facing scrutiny for a series of verbal slip-ups on the campaign trail, he and his team have leaned more into his support from black voters than ever. They have sought to cast their progressive rivals as representative of an elite class of Democrats that skews whiter, more educated and younger. They have also sought to counter critics who have tried to paint Mr. Biden\u2019s candidacy as one-dimensionally focused on the white working class. \u201cThe bad news is that I have a long record, but the good news is that I have a long record,\u201d Mr. Biden said in an interview with a group of black journalists. \u201cPeople know me, or at least they think they know me, after all this time. They have a sense of who my character is and who I am \u2014 warts and all.\u201d Black voters are more moderate, Mr. Biden argued, and particularly the older ones who make up a large portion of the Democratic electorate in Southern states. This serves him well, he said, because \u201cthat\u2019s kind of where I come from.\u201d Mr. Biden\u2019s communications director, Kate Bedingfield, made a similar argument in a television interview Tuesday. \u201cNo Democrat is going to win the nomination for president of the United States without African-American support,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd nor should they.\u201d \u201cI have never, ever, ever, in my entire life, had a circumstance where I have felt uncomfortable in the black community,\u201d Mr. Biden said in the group interview. He said the same was not true of some liberals. \u201cThere are assumptions made about the black community that I don\u2019t think are accurate,\u201d he said, and \u201cthat\u2019s partly because they haven\u2019t spent much time in the black community.\u201d The interview with Mr. Biden, which was conducted in Washington and lasted more than 90 minutes, covered a wide range of topics. At one point, he criticized another Democratic candidate, Senator Kamala Harris of California, for what he thought was an unfair attack on his record on race during the Democratic debate. He also criticized her campaign\u2019s policy proposals for relying heavily on executive orders instead of legislation. He also used the forum to harshly criticize Mr. Trump, asking the group to imagine if a school principal used some of Mr. Trump\u2019s words. \u201cThe first thing you\u2019d do is to go in there and make sure that son of a bi \u2014 that person \u2014 was fired,\u201d Mr. Biden said, quickly correcting himself. Mr. Biden repeatedly argued that Mr. Trump had inspired racism in America through bigoted speech and nativist policies, but he did not answer a question from The New York Times about whether Mr. Trump was himself a white nationalist. Aides later pointed to a speech he gave earlier this year, when he said Mr. Trump \u201cfanned the flames of white supremacy,\u201d but avoided using such a label to describe the president himself. In another part of the interview, Mr. Biden said there were \u201cthree categories\u201d of white people when it comes to race issues in America. \u201cThere are those who are flat-out just prejudiced, who are supremacists of some degree. There are some who are agnostic and don\u2019t give a damn about it and just go, and there\u2019s folks who want us to do something about it,\u201d Mr. Biden said. Asked why Republicans would work with him as president, when they repeatedly blocked President Barack Obama\u2019s policy proposals, Mr. Biden said he would be able to apply unique political pressure on Republicans because he could appeal directly to their voters. \u201cPart of the role of a president is to persuade,\u201d he said. If Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, were to block him, he said, \u201cGuess what? I\u2019m going to go to Kentucky, and I\u2019m going to campaign.\u201d Polling in recent days has given hope to both Mr. Biden\u2019s camp and the Sanders-Warren wing of the party. A much-talked-about poll published Monday showed the race as a virtual three-way tie, with the rest of the field further back. But Mr. Biden\u2019s pollster, John Anzalone, quickly called the poll an outlier. Other polling has shown Mr. Biden comfortably ahead, including among black voters. But in early-voting primary states, and particularly in Iowa, the race has often appeared fluid, with months to go before the first votes are cast. In his comments, Mr. Biden acknowledged the unpredictability of the nomination contest, drawing a comparison to Mr. Obama\u2019s victory in Iowa in 2008. \u201cI got blown out in Iowa, and all of a sudden, everything changed,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cBarack clobbered me.\u201d",

      "content": " DES MOINES \u2014 Bernie Sanders examined the butter cow. He power-walked by the Ferris wheel. He gobbled a corn dog. He spoke to almost no one. Most presidential candidates use the 10-day Iowa State Fair to showcase their retail campaigning skills, because it is one of the best opportunities to meet a wide cross-section of voters before the caucuses in February. Mr. Sanders\u2019s approach to the event on Sunday \u2014 stride briskly, wave occasionally, converse infrequently \u2014 underscored how he has grounded his campaign in championing ideas rather than establishing human connections. His lectern-pounding, impersonal campaign style served him well during his first presidential run, especially here in Iowa, where his near-victory in the caucuses against Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of State, transformed him into a threat for the Democratic nomination. Yet even as his campaign seeks to project its strength in early primary states, there are signs \u2014 in Iowa polls, conversations with local officials and discussions with dozens of voters \u2014 suggesting that Mr. Sanders, 77, may be struggling to gain traction in the state that fueled his political rise. [Which candidates have qualified for the September Democratic primary debates?] It is a dynamic that was perhaps most evident last weekend at the state fairgrounds: As voters talked up first-time presidential candidates like Senator Elizabeth Warren, Senator Kamala Harris and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., Mr. Sanders was often an afterthought. Some voters cited Mr. Sanders\u2019s age. Others said they wanted to elect a woman. Many praised his ability to push the party to the left but said it was time for someone else to claim the progressive mantle. \u201cI\u2019m liking Elizabeth Warren,\u201d said Danielle Hensley, a 22-year-old student from Iowa City, after casting her presidential vote at the fair\u2019s highly unscientific corn kernel poll. Ms. Hensley supported Mr. Sanders in the caucuses four years ago; now, she explained, she sees him as \u201ca 2016 candidate.\u201d It is still early in the primary season, and Mr. Sanders and his aides dismiss outright any notion that his Iowa campaign has lost momentum, repeatedly asserting that the campaign is well positioned for the long haul. They remain confident that they can energize first-time caucusgoers who were too young to cast their votes four years ago. And they brush off a recent poll that showed Mr. Sanders slipping in the state, saying that it does not capture the views of younger voters, working-class Democrats and others who are not yet paying attention to the race \u2014 groups that the campaign sees as a big part of his base. \u201cWe\u2019re feeling really, really good,\u201d Mr. Sanders told reporters after his turn at the fair\u2019s political soapbox. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to win here in Iowa.\u201d During a conference call with reporters on Monday, Mr. Sanders\u2019s advisers pushed back against doubts about the strength of the campaign, insisting that most polls still have him in second place, and noting that he enjoyed a boost in support in surveys taken after the second Democratic debates. They also maintained that voters trust Mr. Sanders on health care, which his team argues is the most important issue to the electorate. Mr. Sanders has some significant advantages in the state. Through the end of June, he had an estimated 7,000 individual donors in Iowa, according to an analysis of campaign fund-raising records by The New York Times, by far the most of any candidate. And he maintains an army of die-hard liberal foot soldiers who are more than eager to propel him to the convention. On Friday, before the state\u2019s annual Wing Ding dinner in Clear Lake when supporters for the various candidates typically gather and chant outside the event as a show of force, Mr. Sanders\u2019s team boasted that their volunteers had instead knocked on every Democratic door in the town. He plans to return to Iowa next week for what will be his eighth trip to the state since announcing his candidacy in February. But the landscape for Mr. Sanders is vastly different than it was four years ago. Nearly two dozen candidates are now vying for the nomination. And unlike in 2016, when he had the liberal populist message to himself, there are now many other progressives who have adopted a similar agenda. There is also a surging energy among young activists for diversity, female candidates and generational change. At the same time, several Iowa Democratic officials said they were miffed by Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign, which they see as operating as something of a lone wolf. Jeannine Grady, Democratic chairwoman in Marshall County, where Mr. Sanders defeated Mrs. Clinton in the caucuses in 2016, said Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign is not following the traditional campaign playbook of staying in close contact with county chairs. Though running an unconventional, outsider campaign had worked for him in the past, she said, it may not work this time, especially now that his message is no longer novel and voters have so many other candidates on offer. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it\u2019s possible for him to run an insurgent campaign like he did four years ago,\u201d said Ms. Grady, who caucused for Mr. Sanders in 2016. \u201cPart of being an insurgent is being relatively unknown. He can\u2019t now be unknown.\u201d [The race is fluid, and other things we learned from the July Democratic debates.] \u201cSanders is running on the fumes of his last campaign,\u201d said William Baresel, Democratic chairman in Floyd County. \u201cAnd weakness is starting to show in get-out-the-vote efforts they have done.\u201d Sanders allies say it is precisely that willingness to operate outside the established political system that is part of Mr. Sanders\u2019s appeal, especially for those who believe the current system is broken and requires wholesale change. Pete D\u2019Alessandro, who ran Mr. Sanders\u2019s Iowa campaign in 2016 and is now a senior adviser, stressed in an interview that the campaign was working behind the scenes to woo voters who had not yet tuned in to the political process. \u201cIf we do as a team what we\u2019re supposed to do each day, we will be in a position to talk to that voter who can\u2019t engage right now when they\u2019re ready to engage,\u201d he said. \u201cThen you\u2019ll see a whole different dialogue going on.\u201d And he suggested that Mr. Sanders should not be measured by the usual political metrics for success. \u201cThe reason that I\u2019m not concerned is I know at the end of most days, we sit around as a senior staff and we say, \u2018We just won today,\u2019\u201d he said. But if the stakes are high for every presidential candidate in Iowa, they are even more elevated for Mr. Sanders: Many political observers say success for him in 2020 is predicated on a repeat strong performance in the caucuses. And as he traveled across Iowa ahead of his visit to the state fair, Mr. Sanders declared that he planned to win not just the Iowa caucuses, but the nominating contests in New Hampshire, Nevada and California as well. Though he has faced some criticism for adhering strictly to his message, it is, perhaps above all, his constancy that has loyal fans still flocking to his events \u2014 he had one of the biggest crowds at the fair \u2014 and pledging their allegiance. Waiting to hear Ms. Warren speak at the fair on Saturday, Misty Cornelius, 38, of Des Moines, said she remained \u201ca strong Bernie supporter\u201d \u2014 a declaration confirmed by the glittery \u201cBernie 2020\u201d tattoo she bore on her chest. [Sign up for our politics newsletter and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race.] But there were also skeptical voices. \u201cHe\u2019s unrealistic,\u201d said Michael McDonald, 64, of Altoona. \u201cI like Bernie, but he seems a little too old, honestly,\u201d said Andrew Ball, 22, of Iowa City. Teresa Brumer, a 51-year-old dental assistant from Urbandale who caucused for Mr. Sanders in 2016, said she wanted to see if Mr. Sanders was \u201cthe same man as he was four years ago.\u201d He was, she said after hearing him speak. But she was now also considering Mr. Buttigieg. Reid Epstein, Lisa Lerer and Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting from Des Moines, Matt Stevens from New York and Rachel Shorey from Washington.",

      "author": "Stephanie Saul",
      "content": " A new poll suggests that the race for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination may be tightening, with a virtual three-way tie nationally among former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and two more progressive rivals, Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. Despite the dead heat \u2014 Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren each with 20 percent support among Democratic voters, and Mr. Biden with 19 percent \u2014 the Monmouth University Poll released Monday may hint at a concerning trend for the candidacy of Mr. Biden, the poll\u2019s previous front-runner, whose support declined from 32 percent when the Monmouth Poll was taken in June. Mr. Sanders, of Vermont, and Ms. Warren, of Massachusetts, both picked up several percentage points of support since June. Voters were asked whom they would support among 23 Democratic candidates. Patrick Murray, who runs the polling institute at Monmouth, in West Long Branch, N.J., said Monday that the poll suggested that the race for the Democratic presidential nomination was heating up. \u201cThe main takeaway from this poll is that the Democratic race has become volatile,\u201d Mr. Murray said. \u201cLiberal voters are starting to cast about for a candidate they can identify with. Moderate voters, who have been paying less attention, seem to be expressing doubts about Biden.\u201d In an additional statement released two days later, after the release of several more polls that showed Mr. Biden with a lead, Mr. Murray characterized the poll as an \u201coutlier.\u201d \u201cIn the end, we must put out the numbers we have,\u201d he said Wednesday, after outlining the poll\u2019s methodology. \u201cThey should always be viewed in the context of what other polls are saying.\u201d Mr. Murray had cautioned on Monday that the results were just \u201cone snapshot from one poll.\u201d The poll of 800 voters included 298 people considered registered Democrats or Democratic-leaning and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 5.7 percent within that group. It was conducted by telephone from Aug. 16 to 20. [The United States\u2019s election watchdog needs at least 4 members to enforce the law. It\u2019s down to 3.] Ms. Warren\u2019s favorable ratings improved in the Monmouth poll, while Mr. Biden\u2019s slipped and Mr. Sanders\u2019s remained stable. While only one poll, the results seemed to bolster findings of a poll released last week by the Economist and YouGov that hinted at a tight race, showing Mr. Biden with 22 percent support, Mr. Sanders with 19 percent and Ms. Warren with 18 percent. In the poll, 72 percent of Democrats gave a \u201cfavorable\u201d rating to Ms. Warren \u2014 two points higher than Mr. Biden\u2019s favorable rating of 70. Mr. Sanders\u2019s favorable rating was 65 percent. In interviews in Iowa, some of Mr. Biden\u2019s supporters have indicated that they lack enthusiasm for his candidacy, suggesting that his strong poll numbers may mask a softness in his support. The Monmouth Poll found that Mr. Biden\u2019s support had eroded in states that hold earlier primaries, dropping from 26 percent to 20 percent since June. It had also fallen among a broad range of Democrats \u2014 including those who call themselves moderate, conservative and liberal, those with college degrees and those without, white voters and voters of color. In a statement, the Biden campaign noted that the poll was based on a relatively small sample size, and that an average of national polls calculated by RealClear Politics put the former vice president ahead, with 27.2 percent to Mr Sanders\u2019s 16.7 percent and Ms. Warren\u2019s 16.2 percent. Support for most of the other candidates for the Democratic nomination held firm in the Monmouth poll, albeit with far lower numbers than the three leaders. Senator Kamala Harris of California remained steady with 8 percent support. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey gained slightly, from 2 percent in June to 4 percent in August. Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., got 4 percent, compared with 5 percent in June. The poll delivered bad news for another candidate, the California hedge fund billionaire Tom Steyer. Mr. Steyer entered the race in July and has said he would spend $100 million of his own money on his campaign. Because Mr. Steyer registered less than 1 percent support in the poll, he has not yet qualified for the third televised Democratic debate in September, with a deadline to qualify looming on Wednesday. So far only 10 candidates have qualified, meaning the debate is currently set to take place on one night.",

      "author": "Katie Glueck",
      "content": " New polls published on Wednesday show Joseph R. Biden Jr. with a significant national lead in the Democratic presidential race as the contest heads into the intense fall campaign season, with Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders rounding out a threesome that seems to have separated from the rest of the primary field. The new data, which shows Mr. Biden earning the support of about one in three Democratic voters, stands in contrast to a poll published Monday that showed a virtual three-way tie between Mr. Biden, Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders at about 20 percent support each. On Wednesday, the director of that poll called those results an outlier. The latest round of polling suggests that Mr. Biden\u2019s national lead \u2014 at this early stage in the campaign \u2014 has been relatively durable throughout the summer. It has been fueled in part by the former vice president\u2019s strong name recognition, calculations about general election viability and good will from rank-and-file Democratic voters, even as there are signs of greater volatility on the ground for Mr. Biden in the early-voting presidential primary states. [Sign up for our politics newsletter and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race.] Still, national polls can offer a snapshot of the Democratic electorate\u2019s mood, and of the extent to which various controversies have caught the attention of voters. One of the polls published Wednesday, conducted by Quinnipiac University, showed Mr. Biden as the top choice of 32 percent of Democratic voters and independent voters who lean Democratic. Ms. Warren came in at 19 percent and Mr. Sanders was at 15 percent. Those numbers were close to the figures Quinnipiac found at the beginning of the month, with Mr. Biden\u2019s standing unchanged despite several weeks of scrutiny over a series of verbal gaffes. Separately, a poll from USA Today and Suffolk University also found Mr. Biden at 32 percent, followed by Ms. Warren at 14 percent and Mr. Sanders at 12 percent. Those numbers contradict a Monmouth University Poll that drew attention from the news media, including The New York Times, earlier in the week. It showed Mr. Biden plummeting 13 percentage points from June, putting him at 19 percent, with Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders at 20 percent each. On Wednesday, Patrick Murray, the director of that poll, said in a statement that it was clear the results had diverged from the polling consensus. \u201cIt occurs very infrequently, but every pollster who has been in this business a while recognizes that outliers happen,\u201d Mr. Murray said. \u201cThis appears to be one of those instances.\u201d Because there is no national primary, the standing of the candidates in the early-voting primary states may matter far more than nationwide snapshots. Some surveys this summer have shown Mr. Biden\u2019s lead in Iowa and New Hampshire ebb since he entered the race in April, and conversations with voters in Iowa have revealed signs of an enthusiasm challenge for the front-runner. Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders, meanwhile, have established themselves in a tier above the rest of the Democratic field. No other candidate has consistently reached double-digit support in recent surveys; in the Quinnipiac and Suffolk polls, the only other candidates with 5 percent or better were Senator Kamala Harris of California and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. More than a dozen of the Democrats got just 1 percent \u2014 or less. The Quinnipiac poll, conducted Aug. 21-26, and the Suffolk poll, conducted Aug. 20-25, had margins of sampling error of plus or minus five percentage points among Democratic voters. The Monmouth poll, conducted Aug. 16-20, had a margin of error of plus or minus six points. All three were conducted by telephone. The latest round of polling also suggests that the Democratic candidates are on track to have only one presidential debate next month, after two rounds of two-night debates earlier this summer. As of Wednesday\u2019s deadline to qualify for the September debate, only 10 candidates had done so, meaning they can all fit on one stage under the rules set by the Democratic National Committee. The committee requires that candidates land 130,000 individual donors and 2 percent support in at least four qualifying polls in order to make the debate stage. The billionaire impeachment activist Tom Steyer was close to meeting those benchmarks, collecting enough donors and hitting the 2 percent requirement in three polls so far. But he failed to reach 2 percent in either of the polls published Wednesday morning, leaving him one poll short as the midnight deadline approached.",

      "author": "Maggie Astor",
      "content": "  Happy Saturday! Here\u2019s our weekly catch-up on the 2020 presidential campaign and the Democratic field. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, who was seen by some as a major presidential prospect before the race began but never quite got a foothold in the polls, ended her campaign on Wednesday. Ms. Gillibrand \u2014 who anchored her candidacy in issues of women\u2019s equality, with a strong emphasis on abortion rights \u2014 told our colleague Alex Burns that she didn\u2019t see a way to win once it became clear she would fail to qualify for next month\u2019s Democratic debate. \u201cI think being able to have a voice on a debate stage, when other candidates have that, is really important,\u201d she said, \u201cand without it, I just didn\u2019t see our path.\u201d Ms. Gillibrand said she would endorse another candidate eventually but had not yet settled on one. She was the fourth candidate to drop out in August, after former Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado, Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington and Representative Seth Moulton of Massachusetts. The field is set for the third debate \u2014 singular this time. Only 10 candidates met the Democratic National Committee\u2019s tightened criteria, so there will be no need for the two-night affairs we had in June and July. This means all of the top candidates will face off directly for the first time. That\u2019s particularly significant for former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who have not yet shared a debate stage. The debate will be held in Houston on Sept. 12, from 8 to 11 p.m. Eastern time, and will be broadcast on ABC and Univision. In addition to Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren, the qualifiers are: Not everyone is happy about the culled debate field. Several candidates who missed the cut \u2014 including Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado and Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana \u2014 criticized the process, and Mr. Bennet\u2019s campaign sent the D.N.C. a letter asking why it was \u201cin an unprecedented rush to eliminate candidates from a volatile field.\u201d The week began with a Monmouth University poll showing dramatic movement in the Democratic race, with Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren at 20 percent each and Mr. Biden at 19 percent \u2014 down 13 percentage points from a Monmouth poll taken two months earlier. But after several other polls showed a picture much more in line with the Biden-leading status quo, Monmouth\u2019s polling director, Patrick Murray, said it was clear that his survey had been an outlier. Two polls released Wednesday morning showed Mr. Biden at 32 percent, comfortably ahead of Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders. The first poll, from USA Today and Suffolk University, showed Ms. Warren at 14 percent and Mr. Sanders at 12; the second, from Quinnipiac University, showed Ms. Warren at 19 percent and Mr. Sanders at 15. Ms. Harris and Mr. Buttigieg were the only other candidates to break 5 percent. Former Representative Joe Walsh of Illinois announced a long-shot primary challenge to President Trump on Sunday. With the announcement, Mr. Walsh, a Tea Party conservative and talk radio host who served one term in the House of Representatives, joins William Weld, the former governor of Massachusetts, as primary opponents to Mr. Trump. Mark Sanford, the former governor and representative from South Carolina, is also weighing his prospects. Mr. Walsh is taking on Mr. Trump from the right, while Mr. Weld has campaigned from closer to the center, and Mr. Sanford has a reputation as a budget hawk. But Mr. Walsh\u2019s campaign has gotten off to a rocky start. In the days since he officially announced his bid, he has been forced to confront his history of racism and was informed his radio show would be taken off the air. Ms. Harris announced a new plan on Thursday focused on strengthening protections for people with disabilities. She promised to use executive action to ensure that federal agencies \u2014 such as the Transportation Department and the Department of Housing and Urban Development \u2014 required funding recipients to prove that projects would be fully accessible before receiving money. She said she would expand a grant program within the Education Department to cover more workplace accommodations and support more people. And she pledged to create new senior-level positions in the White House that would prioritize accessibility in policymaking, among other measures.",

      "content": "  PITTSBURGH \u2014 Bernie Sanders was in his element \u2014 railing against \u201cthe billionaire class\u201d \u2014 as he talked up his \u201c100-percent pro-union voting record\u201d and his participation in \u201cGod knows how many picket lines.\u201d \u201cAt the end of the day,\u201d he told what his campaign said were over 1,000 Sanders-supporting union members and activists who had dialed into a conference call on Tuesday evening to hear him speak, \u201cit is the trade-union movement in this country which is the last line of defense against the incredible power of corporate America right now.\u201d The call with union members was just one component of a furious, worker-focused effort by Mr. Sanders, the senator from Vermont, to appeal to organized labor as he seeks the Democratic nomination for president. A flurry of recent activity \u2014 which included rolling out a plan for organized labor and addressing striking workers with a bullhorn from the back of a pickup truck in Louisville, Ky. \u2014 was punctuated by a full-throated, raised-fist endorsement in Pittsburgh from the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America, a progressive union with some 35,000 members. Though the show of support was mostly symbolic \u2014 the union is relatively small and has long been aligned with Mr. Sanders \u2014 his campaign\u2019s delighted response underscored just how coveted union endorsements are for many of the 2020 candidates. Despite years of pummeling by Republican-controlled legislatures that have sought to weaken their power, unions are still viewed by Democrats as an important constituency: A Gallup poll conducted in August found that 82 percent of Democrats approve of unions. And beyond the seal of validation endorsements afford, union members still play a critical role in canvassing voters and mustering them to the polls. Though union members have traditionally voted Democratic, many are also eager to hear a candidate address their grievances, a desire that President Trump was able to harness in 2016, presenting new challenges for candidates courting endorsements. Hillary Clinton beat Mr. Trump by only nine percentage points among voters from union households, according to exit polls, a smaller margin than the 18-point advantage President Barack Obama had over Mitt Romney in the 2012 election. \u201cI think the lessons that Democrats \u2014 and these candidates particularly \u2014 have come to understand is, unless you talk about the economic issues that affect working people, you are not going to get elected,\u201d Richard L. Trumka, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said on Thursday at a breakfast hosted by The Christian Science Monitor in Washington. \u201cSo they have begun talking about the kitchen table economics that affects workers. The more they do that, the more workers will connect with them.\u201d The shifting dynamic is fundamentally reshaping how some candidates campaign: While wooing union leaders remains important, there is a growing recognition that to gain union backing, candidates must also appeal directly to the rank-and-file. It is also altering the typical timetable for union endorsements, as many organizations are affording workers more time to weigh in on the crowded field. And so for months, candidates have not just rushed to court union leaders; they have also been holding round-table discussions with members, joining picket lines and tweeting in solidarity as they clamber to prove their affinity with workers. \u201cPretty much every candidate is supportive of labor\u2019s issues,\u201d said Eddie Vale, a Democratic strategist who works with labor unions, including the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, or Afscme. \u201cThere\u2019s no real advantage to putting all your eggs in one basket when whoever is going to win is going to be good.\u201d In the meantime, Mr. Vale said, \u201cYou\u2019re seeing a lot more opportunities for the membership to interact with the candidates directly.\u201d He added that such opportunities carried benefits for both unions and campaigns: Union leaders can get their members more involved in the process, while candidates get a chance to appeal to workers whose votes are up for grabs. Mr. Sanders, a longtime labor ally, has leveraged his vast email list to highlight organizing efforts, offer support for union members and even motivate his own supporters to join with striking workers across the country. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. gave the first speech of his campaign in a Teamsters hall to an audience speckled with the black and gold of the International Association of Fire Fighters, which endorsed him. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts has said she wants a labor leader to serve as her labor secretary. Senator Kamala Harris of California and former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas shadowed a security officer and a home care worker as part of a program with the Service Employees International Union. Labor Day will give the candidates another opportunity to reach out. Mr. Sanders is scheduled to attend a breakfast in Maine held by the Southern Maine Labor Council. Several candidates are slated to attend a picnic hosted by a labor organization in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, including Mr. Biden and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. Yet even as candidates trip over each other to score plaudits from organized labor, most of the major unions have stayed on the sidelines, and many union officials say they do not expect their organizations to announce endorsements anytime soon. \u201cIn the past, we have been a union that has endorsed relatively early,\u201d said Lee Saunders, the president of Afscme, which endorsed Mrs. Clinton in October 2015. \u201cWe are not planning on doing that this time \u2014 we want to hear from the candidates.\u201d The American Federation of Teachers, whose early endorsement of Mrs. Clinton in July 2015 angered some of its members, also has no timetable for making an endorsement, said Randi Weingarten, its president. The organization has already held seven town-hall-style events with candidates, including Mr. Sanders, Ms. Warren and Mr. Biden, and expects to hold more. Ms. Weingarten said the union wanted to allow members to \u201csee who they feel a connection to.\u201d \u201cFor us, it is not just about who shares your values; it\u2019s not just about who\u2019s electable,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is about, do your members feel like they have a real voice in your process?\u201d Lily Eskelsen Garc\u00eda, the president of the National Education Association, which endorsed Mrs. Clinton in October 2015, pointed to the large number of candidates to help explain why the union has no hard deadline for making a 2020 endorsement. \u201cIt\u2019s so fluid,\u201d she said about the race. \u201cAt this point, it would be disingenuous for me to suggest that there is this magical date when we will know that it\u2019s time.\u201d Several of the unions have held, or are planning to hold, candidate forums, including the N.E.A., which held one in Houston in July during its annual meeting that drew 10 candidates, and Afscme, which convened one in Las Vegas in early August that drew 19. The S.E.I.U., one of the largest and most politically powerful unions in the country, has laid out specific criteria for candidates seeking its endorsement, including that they must support legislation to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour and develop an economic plan that includes provisions to help workers unionize. The union has been in direct contact with many of the campaigns and is providing feedback on their policies for organized labor if they seek it. The emphasis on labor in the 2020 campaign has at times tripped up even its staunchest supporters. Mr. Sanders, whose campaign has unionized, recently faced criticism from some of his campaign workers for failing to pay them the equivalent of a $15-an-hour minimum wage because they were working more hours than they had expected. His campaign resolved the issue by raising their salaries and limiting the number of hours some staff members could work. Hotel spending by some of the leading candidates has also come under scrutiny. HuffPost reported in August that Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s campaign had patronized nonunion hotels in several big cities, while the campaigns of Ms. Warren and Ms. Harris spent money at hotels that have been the subject of labor disputes. Missteps aside, Democratic candidates are making a concerted effort to show their support for labor. Mr. Biden, who is betting in part on his appeal to working-class voters, has held briefings with labor leaders in Iowa and New Hampshire this summer. \u201cNo one knows more than Joe Biden that he\u2019s going to have to work for every vote and every endorsement,\u201d said Pete Kavanaugh, a deputy campaign manager for Mr. Biden. \u201cWhat makes him unique is that he has a 40-year record of fighting for middle-class and working families and fighting for union members and their members\u2019 families.\u201d Like those on Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign, Ms. Warren\u2019s staff members have also unionized. She has visited striking Stop & Shop supermarket workers in Massachusetts, rallied with airline catering workers at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport \u2014 as did Mr. Sanders \u2014 and met in Michigan with Delta Air Lines employees who are trying to unionize. Ms. Warren\u2019s team has consulted with unions while developing policy proposals, and she spoke by phone with Mr. Trumka before rolling out her trade plan. She has met with labor leaders in every state she has visited during her presidential bid, her campaign said. Mr. Saunders of Afscme recalled how he met privately with Ms. Warren at her condo in Washington before she announced her bid, when she told him she intended to run. \u201cWarren is a good friend, I talk to her quite a bit,\u201d Mr. Saunders said, praising what he called her \u201cretail politics\u201d skills. Stuart Appelbaum, the president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, recalled meeting privately with Ms. Warren at the Capitol before she entered the presidential race, and again in New York this year. Ms. Warren, he said, asked to meet with union members who had been involved in the fight against Amazon\u2019s planned campus in Long Island City, Queens. Ms. Warren \u201cis one smart person who also knows how to listen,\u201d Mr. Appelbaum said, adding, \u201cI am concerned about the candidates who have not sought to reach out.\u201d Mr. Appelbaum, who also offered praise for Ms. Harris, said he expected his union to back a candidate in the 2020 race, but was not sure when it would do so. For now, he credited the candidates for the focus they have put on talking about working people. \u201cI\u2019ve heard more about unions in this race than in all other races combined in recent memory,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no Democratic Party without the labor movement. And I think that at long last, Democratic candidates are waking up to that fact.\u201d",

      "author": "Reid J. Epstein",
      "content": "   CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa \u2014 Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren, two of the leading candidates for the 2020 Democratic nomination, made the case on Monday for muscular new gun control proposals, but differed on whether it was possible to reach compromise with congressional Republicans. Mr. Biden said it was not. Ms. Warren seemed more open to the idea. As much of the Democratic field fanned out across Iowa and New Hampshire to campaign this holiday weekend, Mr. Biden told reporters in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, that the only solution for major new gun control legislation was to defeat Republicans in the elections 14 months away \u2014 \u201cflat-out beat them,\u201d as he put it. Mr. Biden, the former vice president, has made bipartisanship a theme of his campaign and has talked about working with Republicans, including Senator Mitch McConnell. But Mr. Biden took an unequivocal stand on expanded background checks and other measures when asked if there was room to reach a compromise with Mr. McConnell, the Senate majority leader, on legislation following the nation\u2019s latest spate of mass shootings that left 53 dead in August. \u201cNone, none on this. I think this is no compromise. This is one we have to just push and push and push and push and push,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, I think this is going to end with some of them defeated.\u201d Ms. Warren, the Massachusetts senator, has taken more aggressively liberal positions than Mr. Biden on health care, student debt and other domestic issues, and she is generally more critical of Republican Party leaders (while he tends to focus on President Trump). On gun control, she has endorsed a range of measures, but she espoused a different view from Mr. Biden when asked if she could see a compromise with Republicans that fell short of expanding background checks. \u201cCould they agree to do some things and not that one? Look, that\u2019s part of what making legislation is all about,\u201d Ms. Warren said in Hampton Falls, N.H. \u201cWhat we need to do is what\u2019s effective to bring down deaths from gun violence.\u201d Ms. Warren argued that the issue needed to be addressed in a broader way, not just with a single legislative fix. She reiterated the ambitious goal she had included in the gun violence plan she laid out last month: to reduce overall gun deaths, not just those from mass shootings, by 80 percent, along the lines of how the country has reduced automobile deaths over the past half-century. \u201cWe need to treat this as the public health emergency that it is,\u201d she told reporters. \u201cAnd it\u2019s going to take a lot of pieces and a lot of changes that we need to do to bring down deaths from gun violence. And that needs to be our goal.\u201d Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren \u2014 who will meet for their first debate on Sept. 12 after being on separate debate stages in June and July \u2014 were among several Democratic presidential candidates who championed gun control measures over the Labor Day weekend in the aftermath of the fatal shootings on Saturday in Midland and Odessa, Tex. At a town hall-style meeting in Peterborough, N.H., Senator Bernie Sanders called for background checks as well as a new assault weapons ban, and argued that most Americans support greater gun control measures \u2014 but their views are being countered by the influence of the National Rifle Association. \u201cWe are telling Trump and McConnell, listen to the American people and not the N.R.A.,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., who was campaigning in Cedar Rapids on Monday, said background checks were already \u201ca very middle-of-the-road, rather conservative compromise.\u201d He signaled that Democrats needed to stand firm on proposals for background checks, which are expected to be part of a gun control debate in Washington following the mass shootings in El Paso, Midland and Odessa, and in Dayton, Ohio. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get out of a defensive crouch,\u201d Mr. Buttigieg said of Democrats. \u201cThe overwhelming majority of the American people are with us, and the congressional G.O.P. can only reject the American people\u2019s desires for so long before they\u2019re going to pay a political penalty for that. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get something real out of this,\u201d he said. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who, like Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg, holds a mix of progressive and moderate views, said background checks were \u201cthe minimum that we should do.\u201d \u201cThen we should go to something that will make the biggest difference for the mass shootings,\u201d such as a new assault weapons ban, she said. With their remarks, the Democrats were seeking to add more pressure to Mr. Trump, who indicated openness to background checks after the El Paso and Dayton shootings, and to Mr. McConnell, who has promised a Senate debate this fall. The Democratic-led House has already passed background check legislation this year, but the N.R.A. has pressured Mr. Trump and other Republican leaders to back off new steps on background checks. For the most part over the holiday long weekend, the Democratic candidates struck upbeat notes at events as they exchanged hearty handshakes and nice-to-meetchas, and dropped by picnics and ice cream socials in Iowa and New Hampshire. The 2020 Democratic nomination remains very much up for grabs heading into Labor Day week, which traditionally marks the start of a fall campaign season when presidential primary fields winnow and more voters start picking favorites. As the Democratic field stands now, 20 candidates are still running, but only 10 of them have qualified for the next two debates, on Sept. 12 and Oct. 15. Of that group, just three candidates \u2014 Mr. Biden, Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren \u2014 have consistently been in the double digits in recent polls. A fourth, Senator Kamala Harris, has dipped in some polls but has shown an ability to achieve breakout moments, as in her June debate performance, and remains a broadly appealing campaigner. Mr. Buttigieg and Senator Cory Booker are building out ground forces in Iowa, which votes first on Feb. 3, and Ms. Klobuchar is also making a push in that state. At the same time, the field\u2019s shape at summer\u2019s end looks not unlike it did at spring\u2019s end. Mr. Biden entered the presidential race in late April as the Democratic front-runner; he remains in that position, having withstood summer challenges from second- and third-tier contenders. But Mr. Biden has yet to come under sustained attacks from his closest competitors at this point, Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders, who have large numbers of deeply enthusiastic supporters. Mr. Biden\u2019s summer has hardly been a smooth ride. Mr. Booker and Ms. Harris attacked his record on race. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand did so on gender issues, before dropping out last week. Mr. Buttigieg, who is 37 years old, has built his campaign on an unsubtle age contrast with Mr. Biden, who is 76. Yet more than four months after he opened his campaign, Mr. Biden remains the leader. Few of the Democratic county leaders and party activists who populate Iowa\u2019s political class say they are thrilled with the former vice president, and many say there\u2019s little enthusiasm for his candidacy, yet he remains atop almost all polls of Democrats, in Iowa and elsewhere. In two weeks, the top three candidates will appear on a debate stage for the first time when the top 10 Democrats gather in Houston. ABC\u2019s moderators are certain to draw contrasts between Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren, who have clashed on economic issues across the last three decades. Mr. Sanders, though ideologically more similar to Ms. Warren, shares with Mr. Biden a base of lower-educated and lower-information voters in the Democratic contest. How Mr. Sanders, Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren will compete and contrast themselves with one another is one of the biggest questions of the autumn phase of the campaign \u2014 as is whether voters will rally around any particular candidate on issues like gun control. Ann Haaser, 65, came to a house party for Ms. Warren in Hampton Falls on Monday wearing a red \u201cMoms Demand Action\u201d T-shirt. Ms. Haaser, a Democrat who is part of the Massachusetts chapter of the organization that advocates gun control, said that requiring a background check for every gun purchase is the most critical legislative step to take. \u201cIf we put through policy that has been watered down so much that it\u2019s not meaningful, that it\u2019s not going to solve the problem, then that\u2019s not what we want,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have a big gun violence crisis in this country at this point.\u201d But other voters were more favorable toward bipartisan action. Tom Slater, an 82-year-old Democrat at the house party, said the country needed to have universal background checks and a ban on assault weapons, and he spoke positively about creating a national licensing program for gun owners. But in the meantime, he suggested Democrats should support smaller changes. \u201cWhatever in a positive nature Republicans are willing to do, I think we ought to join it, but also state that this is not enough; we intend to do more,\u201d he said as he waited in the rain in Ms. Warren\u2019s selfie line.

      "author": "Coral Davenport",
      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts released an ambitious new climate change plan on Tuesday, embracing goals laid out by a former presidential rival and calling for $3 trillion in spending over a decade to combat human-driven global warming. Ms. Warren made her announcement on the eve of a CNN town-hall-style event on global warming, which 10 top Democrats in the 2020 field are scheduled to attend on Wednesday \u2014 the first time in a presidential campaign that the question of what to do about the heating planet has merited its own major forum on prime-time television. Senator Kamala Harris of California is expected to put forth a detailed climate change plan on Wednesday morning, and three other Democratic presidential candidates \u2014 Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former housing secretary \u2014 have also released climate change plans since Sunday. Political analysts say the rush of plans is a sign that the issue has gained remarkable traction on the national stage, as scientific reports conclude that climate change is leading to dangerous outcomes for humanity, including more powerful hurricanes, stronger droughts and shortages of food and water. The forum comes as Hurricane Dorian moves \u201cdangerously close\u201d to Florida after inflicting devastating damage to the Bahamas, where at least seven people died. Ms. Warren\u2019s new climate plan explicitly adopts ideas from Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington, who focused his presidential campaign on combating climate change but dropped out last month after it became clear he was unlikely to qualify for the next primary debate. Ms. Warren met with Mr. Inslee last week in Seattle, according to two people familiar with their discussions. \u201cWhile his presidential campaign may be over, his ideas should remain at the center of the agenda,\u201d Ms. Warren wrote in her new climate plan. Mr. Inslee released six detailed climate plans, totaling over 200 pages, which were widely praised by environmental policy experts for their rigor. He said he hoped they would help \u201craise the ambition\u201d of other candidates\u2019 climate policies, and he has since had conversations with several candidates about how to incorporate his ideas into their plans, said his former campaign spokesman, Jared Leopold. In her new proposal, Ms. Warren adopts Mr. Inslee\u2019s plan to eliminate planet-warming emissions from power plants, vehicles and buildings over 10 years, and adds an additional $1 trillion in spending to subsidize that transition. The spending would be paid for, she says, by reversing the Trump administration\u2019s tax cuts for wealthy individuals and corporations. Like Mr. Inslee\u2019s proposal, her plan would set regulations aimed at retiring coal-fired electricity within a decade, but also fund health care and pensions for coal miners. It would create new federal regulations on vehicle tailpipe emissions with the goal of achieving zero emissions from new light-duty passenger vehicles, medium-duty trucks and buses by 2030. In April, Ms. Warren released a plan to ban fossil-fuel leasing on public lands. In June, she unveiled a proposal calling for $2 trillion in spending on \u201cgreen manufacturing,\u201d which is incorporated in her new, broader climate plan. Mr. Castro\u2019s plan, also released Tuesday, includes several ideas either directly adopted from or developed in consultation with Mr. Inslee, such as a plan to replace all coal-fired power generation with zero-emissions sources by 2030, and a proposal to marshal $10 trillion in federal, state, local and private spending on jobs associated with the transition from polluting to nonpolluting energy. Democratic strategists said that Mr. Inslee\u2019s influence on the rest of the party\u2019s presidential field was clear. \u201cInslee is one of those rare candidates who did not last for more than a few months but had a big impact on the race,\u201d said Robert Shrum, a veteran Democratic consultant and director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at the University of Southern California. \u201cHis candidacy is over, but his ideas do live on.\u201d Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a rival of Ms. Warren\u2019s on the left, has not explicitly taken up Mr. Inslee\u2019s ideas. Instead, analysts said, he is trying to win over the progressive wing of the Democratic Party with a climate plan that takes its name from the Green New Deal and has the biggest price tag of all the candidates\u2019 proposals \u2014 $16.3 trillion over 15 years. He has called for banning fracking to extract natural gas and halting the import and export of coal, oil and natural gas. \u201cI think Sanders is looking for ways to prove that he\u2019s the true progressive in the race,\u201d said Paul Bledsoe, a lecturer at American University\u2019s Center for Environmental Policy. Polls reflect that climate change is a rising concern among voters. In a poll published by Quinnipiac University last week, a majority of registered voters nationwide, 56 percent, said that climate change is an emergency. That majority included 84 percent of Democrats, while 81 percent of Republicans said that climate change is not an emergency. Among 18- to 34-year-old voters, who may expect to be the most affected by climate change, 74 percent said that climate change is an emergency. Voters also think that the United States is not doing enough to address climate change, with 67 percent saying more needs to be done. Republican officials say the plans that Democrats have devised to address climate change will decimate the economy. Mandy Gunasekara, a former policy adviser at the Environmental Protection Agency under the Trump administration, branded Democrats\u2019 plans as socialist takeovers of the economy. \u201cMost Americans who talk about climate change, when you ask them, \u2018O.K., how much are you willing to pay,\u2019 it\u2019s minimal to none. These trillion-dollar plans that each of them are putting up need some measure of honesty,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat are the true costs and how are the costs going to be borne? And what are the implications for our fossil workers?\u201d Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for President Trump\u2019s re-election campaign, wrote in an email, \u201cThe Democrats\u2019 radical approach to energy is to eliminate the use of all fossil fuels, which would kill more than 10 million jobs and inflict economic catastrophe across the country.\u201d Mr. Bledsoe said there was some political danger for Democrats in attempting to outdo one another. \u201cIn all honesty, every one of the climate plans proposed is more ambitious than anything that\u2019s ever been remotely contemplated before,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, these are just off-the-charts ambitious, so in that sense activists have gotten what they wanted. But the danger is that they ignore the nuts and bolts of energy politics of swing states and risk handing Trump the election.\u201d",

Mr. Sanders was among the biggest names in a procession of Democratic presidential candidates who affirmed their support for unions on Wednesday in speeches at a labor convention near Des Moines. \u201cIf there is going to be class warfare in this country, it\u2019s time that the working class of this country won that war and not just the corporate elite,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. More than a dozen candidates spoke at the convention, held by the Iowa Federation of Labor, A.F.L.-C.I.O. For the Democrats, it was another chance to advance their argument that the economy is failing working people \u2014 and that strengthening unions is a critical step to empowering workers. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota spoke of her grandfather, a union iron ore miner. Former Representative John Delaney of Maryland told the crowd of his father, a union electrician. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said she had helped graduate students, casino workers and airport workers unionize. [Sign up for our politics newsletter and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race.] Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado rolled out a new policy plan focused on American workers, particularly those without a four-year college degree. \u201cIn this election, it won\u2019t be enough to run against Donald Trump\u2019s lies and empty promises,\u201d Mr. Bennet said. \u201cWe need to make crystal clear that the Democratic Party stands for working people.\u201d The candidates\u2019 speeches also put a spotlight on the continuing divisions over whether to move to a \u201cMedicare for all\u201d system that would eliminate private health insurance \u2014 and the ramifications that would have for union members, whose leaders often negotiate generous health care plans with employers at the expense of raising wages or securing other benefits. Several candidates argued against getting rid of private health insurance \u2014 a move supported by Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren under Medicare for all. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who wants to allow people to keep their private insurance but give them the option of signing up for a government-run health plan, was among those to raise the issue. \u201cYou\u2019ve negotiated really hard for your benefits with your union with the employer,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd my plan, you get to keep it \u2014 you don\u2019t have to give it up.\u201d Mr. Sanders\u2019s labor plan appeared designed to pre-empt that criticism. It would require that employers dedicate the savings they receive when they no longer fund union-negotiated health plans toward raising wages and adding other benefits. The candidates appeared at the convention amid increasing concerns that the United States is at risk of slipping into a recession. President Trump said on Tuesday that he was considering \u201cvarious tax reductions,\u201d including a payroll tax cut, to stimulate the economy, though he backed off those comments on Wednesday. The candidates at the event on Wednesday generally stayed away from talk of a recession but used the opportunity to emphasize their support for organized labor. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey said, \u201cThe American dream is not possible without unions.\u201d Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., spoke of \u201cthe freedom to organize for a good day\u2019s pay for a good day\u2019s work.\u201d Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former housing secretary, promised to appoint a labor secretary \u201cwho will champion the ability of labor unions to organize.\u201d Former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas said supporting unions was \u201cgreat for this entire country.\u201d Mr. Sanders called his new labor plan \u201cthe strongest pro-union platform in the history of American politics.\u201d It would allow a majority of workers to form a union simply by signing authorization cards, rather than winning a secret ballot election, which would make unionizing substantially easier. It would also end so-called right-to-work laws that exist in more than half the states, which allow workers to opt out of paying union fees if they choose not to join a union, even if the union bargains for their contract. Unions argue that this allows workers to receive the benefits of membership without helping to offset the costs of providing such services. Mr. Sanders would also create a system in which workers bargained for wages and benefits by industry, rather than with particular companies, as federal labor law currently requires. That would make it possible to increase wages and benefits for more workers at once, and potentially ease employers\u2019 concerns that raising wages would put them at a competitive disadvantage. And Mr. Sanders would require employers receiving federal contracts to pay workers at least $15 per hour and to remain neutral in union organizing campaigns. The plan \u201cis an important recognition of the fact that tinkering around the edges isn\u2019t going to be enough to return power to American workers in our economy,\u201d said Sharon Block, a former National Labor Relations Board member appointed by President Barack Obama, who is executive director of the Labor and Worklife Program at Harvard Law School. Also on Wednesday, the president of the Service Employees International Union, one of the largest and most politically powerful unions in the country, laid out a plan for changing federal labor laws that overlapped with Mr. Sanders\u2019s proposal. In a speech in Milwaukee, the S.E.I.U. president, Mary Kay Henry, emphasized the need for industrywide bargaining of the sort Mr. Sanders proposed, and said that candidates who declined to support the union\u2019s plan \u201ccan\u2019t count on our support.\u201d Ms. Henry said in an interview that Mr. Sanders had answered \u201cthe demands he\u2019s been hearing from fast food workers,\u201d which the union has been working to organize. The Sanders campaign worked closely with the S.E.I.U. and other unions on the plan before rolling it out, according to a campaign aide. Making it easier for workers to unionize would generally benefit Democratic candidates, according to both supporters and opponents of such proposals. Union members often play a key role in canvassing voters, and members tend to vote for Democrats at higher rates than other voters with similar demographic characteristics. \u201cResearch indicates that unions can shape the ways that their members think about politics,\u201d said Alexander Hertel-Fernandez, a political scientist at Columbia University who studies the politics of labor. Other candidates, including Mr. Buttigieg and Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York, have also proposed significant overhauls of labor law. Ms. Henry issued a warning on Wednesday to candidates who had not put forth such plans that the union\u2019s support might not be forthcoming. \u201cIt\u2019ll be part of what we evaluate,\u201d she said. Joe Trippi, who helped broker the S.E.I.U.\u2019s endorsement of Howard Dean in 2003, when he managed the former Vermont governor\u2019s presidential campaign, said he doubted that the threat would force the eventual Democratic nominee to adopt the service employees\u2019 labor agenda if he or she had not done so already. \u201cI think it\u2019s more likely this is a marker to get candidates to move toward them prior to Iowa and the primary season,\u201d Mr. Trippi said in an email. \u201cBy the time someone is the nominee it\u2019s often too late to move them. Putting a marker down now is smart.\u201d",

      "author": "Matt Stevens",
      "content": "  A lot happened on the presidential campaign trail this week. Here\u2019s our weekly catch-up on the 2020 election and the Democratic field, which is still 20 candidates strong. The Democratic National Committee refused to hold the climate-focused presidential debate that Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington and several other candidates wanted. So CNN stepped in with seven straight hours of climate-focused town hall events. Mr. Inslee\u2019s influence was on full display, despite the fact that he dropped out of the race last month. One after another, 10 candidates \u2014 the same ones who will participate in the next debate on Thursday \u2014 said addressing climate change would be one of their top priorities in office. Viewers who based their drinking game on the phrase \u201cexistential threat\u201d might not have survived. Perhaps more notable, the plans we heard about (more on those below) were more aggressive even than what candidates were proposing a few months ago. When The Times surveyed the Democratic field on climate policy in April, only four of the candidates in Wednesday\u2019s forum definitively supported carbon pricing. (Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. wasn\u2019t in the race yet.) By this week, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont was the only one of the 10 who didn\u2019t \u2014 and even so, he is calling for an expansive, $16 trillion program to combat climate change. Almost without exception, the candidates in the CNN forum focused on the impact climate change is having on people of color and low-income communities. Often, they emphasized, the people hit hardest by extreme weather are those with the fewest resources to cope with it. Five candidates specifically used the term \u201cenvironmental justice,\u201d which \u201cembraces the principle that all communities and all people have a right to equal protection of our environmental laws,\u201d said Robert Bullard, a professor of urban planning and environmental policy at Texas Southern University. It was one more example of a major shift within the Democratic Party, toward an acknowledgment that a lot of the biggest policy issues \u2014 from criminal justice to abortion to, yes, climate change \u2014 are inextricably tied to racism and inequality. In preparation for the town hall events, several candidates released detailed climate change proposals this week. Asked by an audience member at the climate forum whether he would address population growth in his climate change policy, Mr. Sanders said he would. He also criticized the Mexico City agreement, a federal policy that bars foreign aid to any organization that \u201cperforms or actively promotes abortion as a method of family planning.\u201d Because many groups that provide birth control and other services also perform or offer referrals for abortions, the policy, sometimes called the global gag rule, reduces access to contraception. \u201cI think, especially in poor countries around the world where women do not necessarily want to have large numbers of babies, and where they can have the opportunity through birth control to control the number of kids they have, it\u2019s something I very, very strongly support,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. In response, anti-abortion groups falsely claimed that Mr. Sanders had endorsed eugenics. While it was unusual to bring up the agreement in the context of population growth \u2014 normally, Democrats criticize it for restricting women\u2019s rights \u2014 opposition to the Mexico City policy is standard for Democrats. Democratic presidents routinely rescind the policy, and Republicans routinely reinstate it. And Mr. Sanders\u2019s comments focused on the policy\u2019s impact on birth control access \u2014 he did not call for more abortions. In fact, researchers have found that abortion rates in affected countries actually increase when the Mexico City policy is in place. Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, a former superintendent of Denver Public Schools, released his wide-ranging education agenda. As part of his plan, which he titled \u201cEqual Must Be Equal,\u201d Mr. Bennet made a sweeping promise: \u201cBy 2028, every child born in this country, regardless of circumstance, will be at the center of a community that offers them a real chance to flourish personally and prosper financially.\u201d He said his administration would create 500 \u201cRegional Opportunity Compacts\u201d to \u201cconnect the dots between what is taught in schools, what skills local employers need, and how we support students so they can enter the work force.\u201d He pledged to spend $10 billion annually for five years to create the compacts. Mr. Bennet also called for universal preschool, higher teacher pay, support for districts that choose to extend the school year, free community college and steps to reduce student debt. Mr. Sanders, meanwhile, previewed a plan to cancel all $81 billion in past-due medical debt and allow other existing and future medical debt to be discharged. He said he would ensure that no one\u2019s credit score was negatively affected by unpaid medical bills. And Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana released a rural policy plan titled \u201cA Fair Shot for Rural America.\u201d In it, he called for the establishment of an Office of Rural Affairs, a rural \u201copportunity zone\u201d initiative, increased grants and more. Howard Schultz (remember him?), the former chief executive of Starbucks, announced Friday that he would not run for president as an independent. Mr. Schultz, 66, had floated the idea in January before starting a book tour, arguing that he could earn the support of moderate Republicans and Democrats who were \u201clooking for a home.\u201d But he immediately faced blowback, particularly from Democrats who worried that an independent bid would all but ensure President Trump\u2019s re-election by splitting the anti-Trump vote. In an open letter, Mr. Schultz acknowledged that he had arrived at a similar conclusion. \u201cNot enough people today are willing to consider backing an independent candidate because they fear doing so might lead to re-electing a uniquely dangerous incumbent president,\u201d he wrote. Separately, Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York said that he had set a rough deadline of Oct. 1 to decide whether to drop out of the race. That date is not coincidental: It is when candidates must meet the criteria set by the Democratic National Committee to qualify for the debate later that month. \u201cI think the logical thing to say is I\u2019m going to go and try and make the October debates, and if I can, that\u2019s a good reason to keep going forward,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I can\u2019t, I think it\u2019s really tough to conceive of continuing.\u201d Mr. de Blasio made the cut for the first two Democratic debates this summer, but failed to qualify for the September debate after the D.N.C. tightened the requirements.",

      "content": " MANCHESTER, N.H. \u2014 Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s backers roared supportive slogans and banged on drums as they awaited his arrival outside Southern New Hampshire University Arena. Senator Bernie Sanders was welcomed by die-hard fans ready to cheer seemingly every sentence he uttered. Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Senator Cory Booker delivered one applause line after the next. But no one was embraced at the New Hampshire Democratic Party\u2019s state convention Saturday quite like Elizabeth Warren. The Massachusetts senator took the stage to a standing ovation that lasted around two minutes, and the thunderous applause that frequently interrupted her speech was amplified by the inflatable noisemakers that had been distributed to the crowd. \u201cWin with Warren!\u201d attendees yelled. \u201cThere is a lot at stake, and people are scared,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we can\u2019t choose a candidate we don\u2019t believe in because we\u2019re scared.\u201d It\u2019s a version of a line that Ms. Warren has deployed before, though it took on new significance days before she faces off against Mr. Biden \u2014 who is running explicitly on a message of electability \u2014 for the first time on the presidential debate stage. Ms. Warren and Mr. Biden were two of 19 candidates who assembled here for a daylong party gathering that attracted some of the state\u2019s most committed activists, including more than 1,200 delegates. The event was an imperfect test of the New Hampshire primary electorate \u2014 indeed, there were plenty of attendees who came from out of state. An unknown number of Warren supporters came to the event from outside New Hampshire, judging from several social media posts of Democratic backers from Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island and elsewhere who came to the convention for her on Saturday. Out-of-state supporters for candidates including Mr. Biden and Senator Kamala Harris also attended the event, according to interviews and social media posts. Campaigns often bus in some supporters and allies for major events.  It was not clear on Saturday night to what extent the different campaigns coordinated the importing of supporters. A Warren spokeswoman declined to comment. Still, the event did offer an early window into campaign organization and enthusiasm, in a contest that is traditionally a must-win for candidates from neighboring states This cycle, that includes Mr. Sanders of Vermont, who won New Hampshire by a wide margin in 2016, and Ms. Warren, whose ground game is often regarded as the most extensive here. As he has nationally, Mr. Biden has led in most New Hampshire polls since entering the race \u2014 though the surveys have been relatively few, and his campaign last week sought to downplay expectations, citing the \u201chome-field advantage\u201d typically enjoyed by candidates from New England. Mr. Biden, who has landed endorsements from several of the most influential Democratic leaders in the state, is focused on blue-collar voters, moderates and others who believe his more centrist brand offers the most promising path to defeating President Trump, in contrast to the more progressive coalitions Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders are working to build. While many voters feel warmly toward Mr. Biden, some have also referenced calculations about his standing against Mr. Trump, rather than displaying outright enthusiasm for his vision for the country. In ways overt and subtle, both of those more liberal candidates and their supporters sought to challenge the idea that Mr. Biden is the only candidate who can win a general election. \u201cI am not afraid,\u201d Ms. Warren said as she called for a \u201cgrass-roots movement\u201d to create structural change. \u201cAnd for Democrats to win, you can\u2019t be afraid either.\u201d Meanwhile, inside the arena, a large banner read, \u201cBernie beats Trump.\u201d Outside, another banner affixed to a pro-Sanders tent read, \u201cIn poll after poll after poll \u2026 Bernie BEATS Trump.\u201d Mr. Sanders received frequent applause throughout his speech and his supporters \u2014 who appeared dispersed throughout the arena \u2014 greeted many of his remarks with loud whoops. \u201cTogether, we will make Donald Trump a one-term president,\u201d he said. \u201cBut frankly, frankly, it is not enough just to defeat Trump. We must do much, much more. We must finally create a government and an economy that works for all of us, not just the one percent.\u201d Mr. Biden, the former vice president, was the first of the presidential contenders to speak, and he received a polite though not raucous reception as attendees trickled into the arena. Taking aim at Mr. Trump, he said: \u201cWe cannot and I will not let this man be re-elected.\u201d The audience cheered, driven in part by a contingent from the International Association of Fire Fighters. \u201cThere\u2019s that sense of, we know who Joe is, and we trust him,\u201d said Sylvia Larsen, the former New Hampshire Senate president. \u201cThere\u2019s still a little bit of people still looking around to say, \u2018Well, O.K., so what else is out there?\u2019\u201d Mr. Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., was another prominent presence at the convention: He had a large cheering contingent that punctuated his address with rounds of applause. Flush with a field-leading fund-raising haul, his campaign has significantly expanded its presence in New Hampshire and has announced the opening of 12 new offices in the state. Senator Kamala Harris of California had a visible and vocal support section, too, boosted by her fans in bright yellow T-shirts. Yet Ms. Harris\u2019s standing in the polls has slipped over the summer, and party leaders here say she does not have the same footprint in the state as some of the other contenders. Perhaps reflecting those dynamics \u2014 and a lunchtime-hour speaking slot \u2014 her reception was uneven. \u201cEverybody else and the pundits can ride polls; I\u2019m not on that roller coaster,\u201d she told reporters after her speech. \u201cI am working hard, we are steady, I don\u2019t get high with the polls, I don\u2019t go low with the polls.\u201d Mr. Booker, too, found himself brushing off the polls, speaking to reporters after giving a well-received speech. His candidacy has mystified some veteran New Hampshire Democrats who note his relatively stagnant poll numbers despite extensive on-the-ground campaign organization, and mounting endorsements. Given the huge cast of candidates \u2014 and how seriously New Hampshire residents take their status as the first primary voters \u2014 many voters are in no mood to commit this early. It is another reminder that the polls could change dramatically before the primary next February. \u201cI think of it like getting an ice cream sundae and trying to decide what toppings you want to put on your ice cream, because they\u2019re very good choices, but I just can\u2019t make up my mind,\u201d said Jeanne Brown from Goffstown, N.H., who attended a Warren event in Bow, N.H., over the summer. \u201cYou know, I don\u2019t know if I want the gummy bears or the sprinkles.\u201d That same indecision was on display Saturday. \u201cI have been waving signs for all the candidates, as have most people on the floor,\u201d said State Representative Kris Schultz, a progressive leader who said that her top choices were Ms. Warren, Mr. Sanders and Mr. Booker \u2014 adding that the New Jersey senator is \u201camazing.\u201d \u201cLots of people remain undecided.\u201d And for all of the enthusiasm for Ms. Warren, some attendees continued to have reservations about her ability to defeat Mr. Trump. \u201cSenator Warren is probably the best campaigner out there, but in order to get elected against Trump I think she\u2019s going to have to moderate some of her priorities,\u201d said New Hampshire State Representative David Karrick Jr. Ahead of the event, activists and other voters rattled off lists of their top three choices, but repeatedly stressed that their rankings could shift. For at least one voter, they changed in a matter of moments. \u201cPete, Warren and then Biden,\u201d said Tim Ashe of Somersworth, N.H., referencing Mr. Buttigieg. \u201cThat may change.\u201d When asked why Mr. Buttigieg was his first choice, he replied, \u201cI was looking at a Pete sign when I said it.\u201d \u201cIf I had to vote today,\u201d he added, \u201cit would probably be for Warren.\u201d His wife, Laurie Ashe, said that she had supported John Kasich, the former Republican governor of Ohio, in the primary in 2016 and then voted for Hillary Clinton in the general election. Now, she said, she is supporting Ms. Warren, because \u201cregular people cannot work their way into the middle class anymore.\u201d Jonathan Martin contributed reporting from Bow, N.H.",

      "author": "Charlie Savage",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Democratic presidential candidates broadly agree that President Trump has shaken the presidency loose from its constitutional limits and say that the White House needs major new legal curbs, foreshadowing a potential era of reform akin to the post-Watergate period if any of them wins next year\u2019s election. In responses to a New York Times survey about executive power, the Democrats \u2014 along with two Republicans mounting primary challenges to Mr. Trump \u2014 envisioned a rebuke of his term by enshrining into law previous norms of presidential self-restraint. Many called for new laws that would require presidents to disclose their tax returns and to divest from significant assets; bar them from appointing close relatives to White House positions; and constrain their abilities to award security clearances and to fire special prosecutors investigating their administration, among other potential reforms. The survey is the first and most detailed collection of the candidates\u2019 views on a set of issues that they are rarely asked about, yet often prove crucial to the outcome of political fights: the scope and limits of a president\u2019s power to act unilaterally or even in defiance of statutes. The survey \u2014 which elicited answers from 15 Democrats, including all in the top polling tier and eight of the 10 in Thursday\u2019s debate \u2014 also focused on recurring constitutional disputes that have arisen under recent presidents of both parties on matters including secrecy and war. \u201cThe American people should fully know how candidates will use the power of the presidency,\u201d Senator Elizabeth Warren wrote, echoing other candidates who agreed that voters should know their views before deciding whom to entrust with the power of the White House. Presidents have \u201ca responsibility to make sure excess power is not used to start endless wars, attack the privacy of Americans, or undermine the democratic values of our country,\u201d she added. But though the candidates \u201cseem committed to reforming the presidency,\u201d they might have second thoughts from the vantage point of the Oval Office, said Jack Goldsmith, a Harvard law professor and former senior Justice Department official in the George W. Bush administration who reviewed their responses. \u201cThe next Democratic president will happily accept new rules on tax releases, but will have a harder time accepting constraints on security clearances and emergency or war powers,\u201d he said. \u201cInstitutional prerogative often defeats prior reformist pledges.\u201d Indeed, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. expressed a more expansive view of presidential war powers after eight years in the Obama White House than he did in 2007 during an earlier run for president. The 2020 candidates agreed on some issues, including that Mr. Bush was wrong to claim after the Sept. 11 attacks that he could override surveillance and anti-torture laws because he was the commander in chief. But they diverged about others, like whether President Barack Obama\u2019s invocation of the same power was legitimate. Mr. Obama used similar reasoning to disregard a requirement that he give Congress 30 days\u2019 notice before transferring Guant\u00e1namo Bay detainees as part of the 2014 Bowe Bergdahl prisoner swap. Senator Kamala Harris, for example, wrote that while a president can lawfully override or bypass statutes that are clearly unconstitutional, she thought the detainee transfer law \u2014 along with the surveillance and anti-torture laws \u2014 was a constitutional limit that presidents must obey. \u201cThe executive branch is not above the law,\u201d she wrote, adding, \u201cAs president, I would respect these laws.\u201d By contrast, Mr. Biden defended the decision by Mr. Obama \u2014 then his boss \u2014 to immediately carry out the exchange after the deal was struck instead of waiting 30 days. Obama administration officials argued that a delay would have endangered the captive soldier\u2019s life. \u201cThe transfer of detainees from Guant\u00e1namo was an exchange of prisoners in a conflict, and therefore a valid exercise of the commander-in-chief power,\u201d Mr. Biden wrote. He participated in an earlier iteration of the survey as a senator seeking the 2008 presidential nomination, and his new answers reflected the understanding of executive authority that he gained from watching close up as Mr. Obama wielded it. In late 2007, for example, Mr. Biden offered a restrictive view of when presidents may unilaterally direct the military to attack other countries, writing: \u201cThe Constitution is clear: Except in response to an attack or the imminent threat of attack, only Congress may authorize war and the use of force.\u201d But in the new survey, Mr. Biden called it \u201cwell established\u201d that presidents may launch limited strikes \u201cwithout prior congressional approval when those operations serve important U.S. interests.\u201d That legal rationale for ordering limited attacks without congressional approval echoed the Obama administration\u2019s stance during the NATO intervention in Libya in 2011. But the bombing campaign violated a limit on executive war-making powers that both Mr. Obama and Mr. Biden had said they would respect in the 2007 candidate survey. Importantly, however, Mr. Biden said both then and now that any bombing of Iranian nuclear sites \u2014 a prospect in which the scope of unilateral presidential war-making authority has repeatedly come up \u2014 would require prior authorization from Congress because it would carry too much risk of escalation into a major war. Still, several of Mr. Biden\u2019s rivals took a more constrained view, suggesting that a rationale of serving American \u201cinterests\u201d is not enough to justify even limited strikes without Congress. \u201cIn situations where the use of force is necessary, absent an imminent threat to our national security, I will take that case to Congress and the American people to seek authorization,\u201d former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke wrote. Most candidates left the door open to using presidential signing statements, when approving bills, to claim a right to bypass provisions they see as unconstitutionally infringing on executive powers. But the answers submitted by the campaign of Senator Bernie Sanders \u2014 which were written in third person \u2014 pledged he would never use them. \u201cSigning statements circumvent the will of Congress and have no constitutional or legal legitimacy,\u201d the response said. \u201cAs president, Bernie would not issue signing statements.\u201d The survey revealed broader disagreements about the wisdom of several other potential reforms raised by Mr. Trump\u2019s record. Significant numbers of candidates stood on both sides of ideas like curtailing future presidents\u2019 latitude to invoke emergency powers and to choose acting agency heads when temporarily filling vacancies. But the candidates were largely united in rejecting the view of Mr. Trump\u2019s legal team, including Attorney General William P. Barr, that obstruction of justice laws do not apply to presidents who abuse their official powers to interfere with investigations for corrupt reasons. Many also expressed skepticism of the Justice Department\u2019s view that sitting presidents are immune from indictment, which bound the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, as he weighed Mr. Trump\u2019s attempts to obstruct the Russia investigation. Most said they would sign a law pausing the statute of limitations for offenses by presidents, ensuring that they can still be prosecuted after leaving office. But they split over what else to do about it. Several said they would direct the department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel to rescind its opinion, while others sidestepped that question. Mayor Pete Buttigieg argued that it would interfere with Justice Department independence for a president to simply direct the office, commonly called O.L.C., to change its legal interpretation. \u201cBecause the integrity of the Justice Department is critical to the rule of law, I do not think it would be appropriate for any president to dictate the legal conclusions that O.L.C. may issue or retract,\u201d Mr. Buttigieg wrote. After The Times began the survey, Protect Democracy, a nonpartisan group of former officials seeking to prevent a decline \u201cinto a more authoritarian form of government,\u201d lobbied the candidates to participate. Justin Florence, a former Obama White House lawyer and the group\u2019s co-founder, praised those who answered the questions. \u201cWith democracy in retreat and autocratic politics on the rise here and around the world, this survey provides critical insights into how each candidate understands the limits on the immense powers they\u2019re seeking,\u201d Mr. Florence said. Several prominent Democratic candidates have not answered the questions. They include Mayor Bill de Blasio, who issued a general statement; Julian Castro, the former Housing and Urban Development secretary; former Representative John Delaney; and the businessmen Tom Steyer and Andrew Yang.",

      "author": "Sydney Ember",
      "content": " PITTSBURGH \u2014 The United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America endorsed Bernie Sanders on Monday, offering one of the few endorsements by a national union as Democratic presidential candidates continue to court labor\u2019s support. The union, which represents some 35,000 workers, voted to back Mr. Sanders directly after he spoke at its national convention in Pittsburgh, where he made a boisterous appeal for its help in the race. \u201cThe UE is about what our campaign is about,\u201d said Mr. Sanders, who was greeted onstage with raucous cheers as he peppered his comments with the phrase \u201cbrothers and sisters.\u2019\u2019 \u201cHaving traveled this country, there is growing disgust on the part of ordinary Americans at the corporate greed that we see,\u201d he said. \u201cThat greed is an illness \u2014 it is an addiction. And if the corporate C.E.O.s don\u2019t get the treatment that they need, we will provide the treatment for them.\u201d Mr. Sanders and UE, which is known for its progressive positions and has long backed the kind of single-payer health care system Mr. Sanders champions, have supported each other for years. In February, just days after entering the 2020 race, the Vermont senator backed striking workers represented by UE at a locomotive plant in Erie, Pa. A local leader for the union spoke at Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign kickoff rally in Brooklyn in March, and chants of \u201cBernie, Bernie!\u201d filled the hotel ballroom during Mr. Sanders\u2019s address on Monday, leaving little doubt as to where the union members\u2019 support lay. \u201cBernie understands the need for workers to have a democratic, independent union movement that is unafraid to challenge Corporate America\u2019s stranglehold on our economy,\u201d Peter Knowlton, the union\u2019s general president, said in a statement. But while the endorsement is somewhat symbolic \u2014 the union is relatively small and does not traditionally endorse presidential candidates \u2014 it comes as several Democratic candidates, including Mr. Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Joseph R. Biden Jr., are jockeying for support from organized labor, a critical constituency especially with such a crowded presidential field. And it follows a flurry of activity from the Sanders campaign to aggressively affirm its on-the-ground support for workers, including a rally on Sunday in Louisville, Ky., with striking AT&T workers. Last week, Mr. Sanders also released an ambitious plan that included setting a goal of doubling union membership in his first term as president. So far, most labor unions are still sizing up candidates and have not offered endorsements. In April, Mr. Biden earned the endorsement of the national firefighters\u2019 union. In June, the 40,000-member New York Hotel and Motel Trades Council endorsed its hometown candidate, Mayor Bill de Blasio. Still, the UE endorsement could amp up the pressure on other candidates who are also seeking organized labor\u2019s support. More than a dozen candidates, including Mr. Sanders, spoke last week at a labor convention held by the Iowa Federation of Labor, A.F.L.-C.I.O. in Des Moines to make their cases for how they would strengthen unions and empower workers.",

      "author": "Lola Fadulu",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 The expanding gap between rich and poor is not only widening the gulf in incomes and wealth in America. It is helping the rich lead longer lives, while cutting short the lives of those who are struggling, according to a study released this week by the Government Accountability Office. Almost three-quarters of rich Americans who were in their 50s and 60s in 1992 were still alive in 2014. Just over half of poor Americans in their 50s and 60s in 1992 made it to 2014. \u201cIt\u2019s not only that rich people are living longer but some people\u2019s life expectancy is actually shrinking compared to their parents, for some groups of people,\u201d said Kathleen Romig, a senior policy analyst at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Income inequality has roiled American society and politics for years, animating the rise of Barack Obama out of the collapse of the financial system in 2008, energizing right-wing populism and the emergence of nationalist leaders like Donald J. Trump, and pushing the Democratic Party leftward. Senator Bernie Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, commissioned the report from the Government Accountability Office, Congress\u2019s independent watchdog, and seized on its findings. \u201cPoverty is a life-threatening issue for millions of people in this country, and this report confirms it,\u201d Mr. Sanders said in a statement. The Census Bureau reported on Tuesday that the poverty rate declined last year to 11.8 percent, the lowest level since 2001. But median household income was $63,200 in 2018, essentially unchanged from a year earlier, and income gains slowed last year from the increases posted in 2015 and 2016. The accountability office\u2019s study looked more broadly at the relationship between income, wealth and longevity \u2014 and how wealth and income are distributed among older Americans over time. It found that while more older Americans were living into their 70s and 80s, not everyone was living longer. Greater levels of income and wealth were associated with greater longevity. The report looked at the population of Americans born between 1931 and 1941. Just 52 percent of that group who had incomes in the bottom 20 percent of midcareer earnings were alive in 2014, compared with nearly 75 percent of people in the top 20 percent. The study found similar results when zeroing in on accumulated wealth instead of annual income. The accountability office found that demographic characteristics were also associated with longevity. Women in the group tended to live longer than men: Almost 70 percent of women were living in 2014, compared with almost 60 percent of men. But, Ms. Romig noted, \u201cthe poorest 40 percent of women actually have lower life expectancies than their mothers did.\u201d Non-Hispanic whites and Hispanics tended to live longer than blacks: 68 percent of Hispanics and 65 percent of non-Hispanic whites lived to at least 2014, compared with 52 percent of non-Hispanic blacks. Advocates have long pointed to racism in the health care system, for example, as a culprit for the high black maternal mortality rate. Of the group born between 1931 and 1941, 75 percent who graduated from college were alive in 2014, compared with 65 percent of those who graduated from high school and 50 percent of those who had less than a high school diploma or an equivalency diploma. This is in part because people with a college education generally have higher incomes and wealth accumulation than those who did not attend college. \u201cWe don\u2019t want groups of people moving backward,\u201d Ms. Romig said, adding: \u201cWe don\u2019t just want some people to be healthier and longer lived; we want everyone to equally share in these gains.\u201d The study notes that a significant portion of the original group was alive in 2014. \u201cTaken all together,\u201d it said, \u201cindividuals may live a long time, even individuals with factors associated with lower longevity, such as low income or education.\u201d But even though Americans may live a long time, they are struggling. The portion of Americans aged 55 or older who are still working increased from 30 percent in 1989 to 40 percent in 2018, in part because stagnating wages are hindering savings and wealth accumulation. When older Americans do finally retire, most are depending on Social Security and other safety net programs. This is alarming because Social Security is \u201cfacing financial difficulties that, if not addressed, will affect its long-term stability,\u201d the study said. \u201cIf no changes are made, current projections indicate that by 2034, the retirement program trust fund will only be sufficient to pay 77 percent of scheduled benefits,\u201d the study said. That finding could help conservatives resurrect efforts to overhaul Social Security \u2014 and cut the growth of benefits for some. Rachel Greszler, a research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said Social Security needed \u201cimmediate reforms.\u201d She suggested that policymakers \u201cbring benefits up and maintain them for lower-income individuals\u201d while \u201creducing benefits for upper-income earners who don\u2019t need it as much and have retirement accounts they can rely on.\u201d Presidential candidates, including Mr. Sanders, are not likely to embrace that conclusion, but they will press the issue of growing inequality. \u201cWe must put an end to the obscene income and wealth inequality in our country, and ensure living wages, quality health care and retirement security for our seniors as human rights,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cIf we do not urgently act to solve the economic distress of millions of Americans,\u201d he added, \u201ca whole generation will be condemned to early death.\u201d",

      "author": "Zolan Kanno-Youngs",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 One Democratic candidate would post asylum officers at the border to decide immigration cases on the spot. Others would create an entirely new court system outside the Justice Department. Some have suggested reinstating a program that would allow Central American minors to apply for refugee status in their home countries. The Democrats running for the White House do not lack ideas on the hot-button issues of immigration and border control. But as they prepare to take the stage on Thursday for their debate in Houston, most would rather talk about the hard-line policies of the man they seek to replace, President Trump. Revealing specific details on immigration could undoubtedly backfire because \u201cit is in many ways a third rail in our politics\u201d now, said Doris Meisner, a former commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the agency that was responsible for immigration enforcement in the United States before ceasing operations in 2003. But, she added: \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to be against things. You have to figure out what you\u2019re for, and you have to make a case for why you think things should be different.\u201d An examination of the candidates\u2019 immigration policies and stances shows they have spent most of their efforts on dismantling the Trump administration\u2019s policies, without really laying out how, if elected, they would handle illegal border crossings, eliminate a growing immigration court backlog, direct immigration enforcement or address the root causes of migration from Central America. Four of the leading candidates who will debate on Thursday \u2014 former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke, Senator Elizabeth Warren, former Housing Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro and Senator Cory Booker \u2014 have released plans touching on each of those questions. The former technology executive Andrew Yang and Senator Kamala Harris have issued more limited plans, with Ms. Harris\u2019s focusing on providing protections for young immigrants brought here illegally as children, known as Dreamers. Campaign advisers for former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Bernie Sanders said the candidates were set to issue plans in the coming weeks. But the candidates are largely refraining from going in depth on the most salient issues of immigration policy, including whom they would deport and whom they would let into the country. The \u201copen borders candidate\u201d label \u2014 already applied to the field by Mr. Trump \u2014 could alienate voters otherwise open to the Democratic pitch. \u201cThe Democrats\u2019 strategy is to make white women in the suburbs cry about Trump\u2019s treatment of migrants and then pivot to health care,\u201d said Chris Newman, the legal director for the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, a pro-immigration group. \u201cThat approach might have worked in 2018, but I don\u2019t think it will work in 2020, in part because Trump won\u2019t let them pivot to health care.\u201d The immigration issue already had a noticeable impact on the race during the first round of Democratic debates in June. On the first night, Mr. Castro pointedly asked the other candidates to join him in supporting the repeal of a statute that makes crossing the border without permission a criminal offense. The next night, with another 10 presidential candidates onstage, moderators asked for a show of hands of those who agreed with Mr. Castro and supported decriminalizing the offense. Eight hands rose. Some candidates added that they also supported providing undocumented immigrants with health care. The next day, Mr. Trump took advantage. \u201cThat\u2019s the end of that race!\u201d he tweeted. Mr. Biden, the early front-runner for the Democratic nomination, has spent most of his time focusing on Mr. Trump\u2019s policies through campaign videos, statements and essays. In an opinion piece in The Miami Herald, Mr. Biden targeted Mr. Trump\u2019s threat to deport millions of immigrants and restrict temporary protections for migrants fleeing disasters. He also blamed Mr. Trump for damaging the United States\u2019 relationship with Mexico. Mr. Biden has made clear that he would invest in Central American countries and technology at the border and support Dreamers. But he has released few details on whom he would prioritize deporting and how he would eliminate the immigration court backlog. The Biden campaign said in a statement that the candidate is focused on addressing the root causes of migration and would, as president, give legal status to Dreamers and streamline the asylum process. The campaign had harsh words for Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201crepugnant\u201d treatment of migrant children and immigration policies, which it described as \u201ccontrary to our values as a nation.\u201d The Democratic candidates have all said they would end the Trump administration\u2019s practices of limiting who can apply for asylum at ports of entry and returning migrants to Mexico while their cases are processed. They would all also increase the annual cap on refugees allowed into the United States, which the president has lowered significantly, and end both the administration\u2019s travel ban and its policy of separating families at the border. \u201cThe Democrats will run on a lesser-of-two-evils strategy as they have been for many years,\u201d Mr. Newman predicted. \u201cThere\u2019s never been an easier time for them to do that.\u201d In response to a list of questions, a campaign adviser for Mr. Sanders specified that his administration would reinterpret the Trafficking Victims and Protection Act, the immigration law that previous administrations have said categorizes children as \u201cunaccompanied\u201d if they arrive at the border with a relative that is not their parent. Mr. Sanders said he did not think children who arrived with uncles, aunts or grandparents should be separated from their companions. Mr. Castro, the first candidate to issue an immigration plan, has said he would transfer enforcement responsibilities within Immigration and Customs Enforcement to other agencies, including the Justice Department. Mr. Castro also said he would reprioritize Customs and Border Protection to focus on drug and human trafficking as opposed to enforcement of immigration laws in the interior of the country through, for instance, traffic stops. Mr. Castro, Mr. O\u2019Rourke, Ms. Warren and Mr. Booker have said in their plans that they would end agreements allowing local police departments to refer undocumented immigrants to ICE. It remained unclear whom the candidates would deport, however. Some of the candidates said they would redirect agents to focus on undocumented immigrants with criminal records, without specifying what kind of criminal histories would warrant detainment or deportation. An adviser for Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign said he would focus on detaining smugglers. \u201cYes, families will be released into our communities,\u201d the campaign said in response to questions. The former congressman and other candidates also said they would support releasing families into the public, instead of holding them in detention facilities at the border. Families would be assigned a case manager and released as their claims were processed. Mr. Yang said he would create a new program that would provide protections for undocumented immigrants \u201cwho have been here a substantial amount of time\u201d to work and live in the country for 18 years while pursuing citizenship as long as they paid their taxes and avoided felony crimes. Immigrants who did not enroll in the program would be deported, according to his plan. Mr. Castro said he would create a \u201cMarshall Plan\u201d for the development of Central American countries. Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign specified that he would invest $5 billion in Central American countries through public and private partnerships. Ms. Warren said she would invest $1.5 billion annually in the countries. Mr. Booker said he would appoint a special envoy to address corruption and violence in the region. At the border, Mr. O\u2019Rourke said he would empower asylum officers to adjudicate cases themselves and would deploy 2,000 lawyers to the border. But the public is unlikely to hear about those details during the debate Thursday, according to Theresa Cardinal Brown, a former Department of Homeland Security official under Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush. \u201cThere is political wisdom in Washington that says the less detail you put out there the better,\u201d Ms. Cardinal Brown said. \u201cThat may be true for politics, but it doesn\u2019t help people get a good understanding of what you\u2019re for.\u201d",

      "content": "  Quick, name the most substantive discussion of foreign policy you have heard during the nearly 10 hours of debates so far. Struggling? Yes, foreign affairs has played a minimal role so far in the Democratic primary debates but that could change on Thursday night. In particular, Mr. Sanders has suggested that he wants to differentiate himself on international matters from Mr. Biden, a former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, especially focusing on Mr. Biden\u2019s initial support for the Iraq War in 2003. But there are plenty of international developments for the candidates to weigh in on: Like on so many matters, Mr. Biden\u2019s long record leaves openings for his rivals to pick over. But it could also give him gravitas in the eyes of many voters, and an ability to position himself as a steady hand at a moment of turbulence. Disagreements within the field over what to do on health care \u2014 the issue that most Democratic strategists believe propelled the party\u2019s gains in the 2018 midterms \u2014 offer some of the clearest fissures in the race. They are likely to be a major issue of debate on Thursday. One reason for that? Multiple campaigns see political advantage in highlighting their differences. For Mr. Sanders, whose campaign has adopted the \u201cno middle ground\u201d mantra, his uncompromising push for \u201cMedicare for all\u201d is almost definitional. Of the 10 candidates onstage, only two have unequivocally stated that they support phasing out private insurers from the American marketplace as part of their plan to implement a \u201cMedicare for all\u201d system: Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren. Advisers to other campaigns have seen that as politically treacherous \u2014 possibly ceding the party\u2019s advantage on the issue back to the Republican Party. Mr. Biden has portrayed his health care plan as building upon the Affordable Care Act, while positioning his pro-\u201cMedicare for all\u201d rivals as undermining that achievement. As Mr. Biden said in a recent television ad, \u201cObamacare is personal to me. When I see the president try to tear it down, and others propose to replace it and start over, that\u2019s personal to me, too. You\u2019ve got to build on what we did.\u201d Our colleague Zolan Kanno-Youngs had a story on Wednesday looking at the immigration plans \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 of the Democratic hopefuls. The story began: The candidates have disagreements: whether to repeal a statute that makes crossing the border without permission a criminal offense, for instance, and whether to provide undocumented immigrants with taxpayer-subsidized health care. And there are also a lot of unknowns about what the candidates favor in terms of who to deport and other areas of immigration that may be unpopular with some Democrats. The debate could bring additional clarity to one of the most hotly discussed and intensely felt issues facing Americans. Ever since they sparred from across a Senate hearing room in 2005, Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren have represented the Democratic Party\u2019s poles on economic policy. Now they will meet on a debate stage for the first time Thursday, an encounter that many Democrats have been eagerly awaiting. There has been relatively little sword-crossing between the two on the campaign trail. Ms. Warren had a lone quip about Mr. Biden previously being \u201con the side of the credit card companies.\u201d Mr. Biden pooh-poohs Ms. Warren\u2019s plans without mentioning her name. But pressed by Thursday night\u2019s moderators and, perhaps, their fellow candidates, there will be little room for Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren to hide from the fight \u2014 one that Ms. Warren appears far more eager to re-enact than does Mr. Biden, who Ms. Warren told The Boston Globe in 2012, once referred to her as \u201cthat woman who cleaned my clock.\u201d With so much anticipation toward and attention to the Biden-Warren showdown, the big question is how long the moderators wait to tee up the confrontation. In the first two sets of debates, NBC and CNN spent the first 30 minutes focusing the candidates on health care policy. Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren differ there, too, but for two candidates hoping to focus on the future, real fireworks may come when they discuss the past. Once upon a time \u2014 in 2015 \u2014 Ms. Warren and Ms. Harris were very close. Ms. Warren was among the first to endorse Ms. Harris\u2019s Senate run, sending a fund-raising solicitation the day her senate campaign began. The two were ideological partners, having worked together when Ms. Harris, as California\u2019s attorney general, sued the big banks over her state\u2019s mortgage crisis. But in the 2020 campaign they have taken different paths while competing for the same set of Democratic voters \u2014 those with college degrees, especially women. Ms. Warren\u2019s rise over the last four months has come as Ms. Harris has fallen. Now they will appear on a debate stage for the first time Thursday night in Houston. Ms. Harris has edged away from the firebrand liberalism Ms. Warren espouses. She\u2019s hedged on her support for a single-payer, \u201cMedicare for all\u201d health care system and stumbled when talking about policy specifics, both areas in the Warren wheelhouse. Ms. Warren, far ahead of Ms. Harris in public polling, is unlikely to go on the attack first, but she is certain to be ready if Ms. Harris seeks to draw a contrast between them or declares that Ms. Warren\u2019s politics are too risky for a general electorate. For Ms. Harris, who has shown great skill at made-for-social media moments, the stakes are much higher. Having seen her debate moment with Mr. Biden dissipate over the summer, she must find a way to strike a permanent vision in voters\u2019 minds in Houston. That may mean taking a bite out of Ms. Warren\u2019s popularity. It spotlights the key candidate pairings and political dynamics onstage, assessing how the top-tier Democrats are likely to engage and how the rest of the contenders will try to find breakout moments.

      "content": " And then there were 10. Many months after the 2020 presidential campaign began, the Democratic debate stage has been winnowed to 10 candidates, exactly half of the remaining field. Thursday night\u2019s debate, which will air from 8 p.m. until 11 p.m. on ABC, will present the first opportunity for all of the race\u2019s leading candidates to appear onstage at once. For months Democrats have been awaiting the clash between former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and the party\u2019s leading liberals, Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont. On either side of them will be Senator Kamala Harris of California and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., who are vying to claw away at the front-runners\u2019 polling advantage. The entrepreneur Andrew Yang is in the No. 6 position. Along the edge are four candidates in danger of being left off the stage later this year after the Democratic National Committee raises the qualification standards for the debates: Senators Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota on one side; former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas and Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former housing secretary, on the other. The debate will begin with one-minute opening statements, followed by questions from the moderators: George Stephanopoulos, David Muir and Linsey Davis from ABC and Jorge Ramos from Univision. ABC told the campaigns there would be just two commercial breaks, one after about 45 minutes of debating and the other after about 90 minutes. The candidates will debate for another 30 minutes after the second commercial break. The breaks will be lengthy \u2014 four minutes each, according to ABC. There will be no closing statements. With Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren onstage together for the first time, the moderators are certain to try to bait them into confronting each other. The pair have a long history, stretching back to a battle in a 2005 Senate hearing over a credit card industry-supported bankruptcy bill Mr. Biden backed and Ms. Warren, then a Harvard law professor, opposed. Expect other fireworks along the way. Ms. Harris has seen her campaign flag after her debate-stage confrontation with Mr. Biden over busing and school segregation gave her a lift, and so has Mr. Buttigieg, who since Labor Day has signaled that he\u2019s prepared to be more combative with the race\u2019s front-runners. Mr. Sanders is likely to take his grievances straight to the moderators, a tactic that could draw in Ms. Klobuchar as well. And then there is Mr. O\u2019Rourke, appearing on a debate stage for the first time since the mass shooting in his hometown, El Paso, transformed his campaign from one focused on Iowa to one hopscotching the country addressing various injustices past and present. He\u2019s also come out with the most robust gun control proposal in the field, arguing for a buyback program that would require owners of assault-style firearms to sell them to the federal government. Mr. O\u2019Rourke hasn\u2019t focused on drawing contrasts with fellow Democrats so far, but he has a chance to try to shame his rivals on gun safety Thursday night. His repeated swearing on the campaign trail prompted ABC to send a memo to the campaigns Tuesday warning that the debate would be broadcast without a delay and \u201ccandidates should therefore avoid cursing or expletives in accordance with federal law.\u201d The wild card is Mr. Yang. He\u2019s far exceeded expectations and could serve purposes ranging from comic relief to outsider breath of fresh air. Mr. Yang\u2019s campaign seems to understand this as his place in the debate. A spokesman promised Wednesday that Mr. Yang would make an announcement that would \u201cbreak the mold of presidential politics\u201d at the debate, but did not elaborate. Little that happened in the first two debates changed the long-term nature of the 2020 campaign. The viral moments that did happen became political cotton candy \u2014 a sugar high that quickly dissipated and left the candidates involved with more of a stomachache than a permanent advantage. For the leading candidates, that means their primary responsibility is to survive and advance to the subsequent rounds of debates. This is all but assured for Mr. Biden, Ms. Warren, Mr. Sanders, Ms. Harris and Mr. Buttigieg. But the others may need a boost to remain on the debate stages come November and December, after the Democratic National Committee raises the donor and fund-raising thresholds required to qualify. Mr. O\u2019Rourke and Ms. Klobuchar have sent fund-raising appeals stressing this point; Mr. Booker\u2019s campaign aides have had internal deliberations on what they may need to change to keep their candidate on the debate stage.",

      "content": " Twitter can\u2019t tell us whether, or how, Thursday\u2019s debate might change voters\u2019 minds. But it can give us the perspectives of some of the people with expertise on primary races: veteran campaign strategists and consultants from both parties. Here is a sampling of their reactions. While there was no consensus on a single winner of the debate, the strategists generally agreed that Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts was near the top. But some also noted that she (and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, with whom Ms. Warren is ideologically aligned on many issues) faced more effective counterarguments than she had in past debates. Mr. Sanders had some good moments, the strategists agreed, but not as consistent or energizing a performance as Ms. Warren. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who had inconsistent showings in the last two debates, did very well in the first part of the debate, several strategists said. But when the moderator Linsey Davis asked him about his record on race and desegregation, he faltered. Senator Kamala Harris of California got good reviews for several exchanges, as well as for her focus on \u2014 baiting of, really \u2014 President Trump. Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former housing secretary, went after Mr. Biden early and hard, suggesting that his memory was failing. Strategists and commentators on both sides of the aisle cringed. But Mr. Castro did earn some praise at other points, including for his discussion of race, and some argued that \u2014 whatever the merits of his jab at Mr. Biden \u2014 his boldness was admirable. Several other candidates had bright moments but did not manage to stand out in the overall reckoning. As for the entrepreneur Andrew Yang, he drew a great deal of attention at the start for announcing that he would give 10 Americans $1,000 a month for a year. But by the time the debate ended three hours later, he had been greatly overshadowed.",

We take a look back at their debate performances.By Thomas KaplanPRINT EDITIONSeptember 12, 2019",
      "author": "Thomas Kaplan",
      "content": " HOUSTON \u2014 Ahead of Thursday\u2019s debate, we looked back at how the leading Democratic candidates \u2014 Joseph R. Biden Jr., Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren \u2014 performed in the first two debates. Here\u2019s a refresher on the high points, and low points, including some of the more memorable lines of the primary race so far. After a shaky performance in the first debate, Mr. Biden was somewhat steadier in his second appearance, including when he reached for a classic Bidenism to respond to talk from his opponents about \u201cMedicare for all\u201d and the failings of the current health care system. \u201cThis idea is a bunch of malarkey,\u201d he said, before warning about what a Medicare-for-all system would cost. Mr. Biden was on the receiving end of the most memorable attack in the debates so far, when Senator Kamala Harris of California confronted him over his comments about segregationist senators and his record on busing. \u201cThere are very few candidates who are able to connect on an emotional and personal level with voters the way Joe Biden typically does. But in that exchange with Harris, when she looked at him and gave an intensely personal anecdote, he fell far short of doing so.\u201d \u2014 Mo Elleithee, former spokesman for the Democratic National Committee, on the first debate \u201c@JoeBiden finally played the card he should have played in the last debate when @KamalaHarris challenged him on race. @BarackObama vetted his record and nominated him for Vice President.\u201d \u2014 David Axelrod, former chief strategist for President Barack Obama, on the second debate It\u2019s usually the moderator who cuts off a candidate. In this case Mr. Biden did it to himself, bringing to a close his lackluster response after Ms. Harris confronted him. Ms. Harris\u2019s attack on Mr. Biden over race and busing gave a jolt of energy to her campaign, attracting a surge in donations and a bump in the polls. By invoking her personal story, Ms. Harris also contrasted herself as a young, fresh face in the Democratic Party, as opposed to Mr. Biden\u2019s elder statesman status. In the second debate, Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii targeted Ms. Harris with a fierce attack on her record as a prosecutor. Ms. Gabbard said Ms. Harris owed an apology to \u201cthe people who suffered under your reign.\u201d Though Ms. Harris has defined herself as a \u201cprogressive prosecutor,\u201d Ms. Gabbard\u2019s attack highlighted a part of Ms. Harris\u2019s career that can be wielded against her in the primary race. \u201cHarris directly confronting Biden on busing/segregationists was historic, powerful, and unimaginable on a presidential stage until very recently, which is itself symptomatic of a world Biden is struggling to defend.\u201d \u2014 Rebecca Traister, writer-at-large for New York magazine, on the first debate \u201c@KamalaHarris has been on defense all night. A stark difference from the first debate.\u201d \u2014 Patti Solis Doyle, campaign manager for Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2008 presidential bid, on the second debate After Ms. Harris confronted Mr. Biden over busing, her campaign tried to capitalize on the moment by selling T-shirts showing a picture of Ms. Harris as a young girl. Mr. Sanders has put a big focus on his signature policy proposal, creating a Medicare-for-all system in the United States. \u201cI wrote the damn bill!\u201d he declared during the second debate. He has not let voters forget it: He has used the line many times on the campaign trail since then. During an exchange about climate change at the first debate, Mr. Sanders raised his hand to signal that he wanted to speak. But the moderators ignored him and turned instead to John Hickenlooper, the former governor of Colorado. The moment typified the night for Mr. Sanders, who at times all but disappeared from the conversation even as his ideas took center stage at the debate. \u201cThese Bernie lines seem very familiar. Is he there or just a hologram?\u201d \u2014 Mr. Axelrod on the first debate \u201cI tend to think candidates who do best in debates are the ones who appear the most committed to whatever it is they are selling. Hands down Bernie wins the health care section \u2014 most Dems are with him on it, and he showed outrage and anger when the gnats swarmed.\u201d \u2014 Scott Jennings, Republican strategist and adviser to Senator Mitch McConnell, on the second debate The line came during an exchange with Representative Tim Ryan of Ohio. The Sanders campaign quickly offered \u201cI wrote the damn bill\u201d stickers in exchange for campaign donations. Ms. Warren found a convenient foil in John Delaney, the former Maryland congressman, who argued in the second debate that the progressive policies she advocates were unrealistic. Ms. Warren\u2019s candidacy revolves around the idea of fighting for sweeping change, and her comeback to Mr. Delaney \u2014 expressing bafflement about why someone would run for president with a message of discouraging big ideas \u2014 packed a punch. Ms. Warren made it through the first two debates without any glaring missteps. But one moment could be used against her in the future: when she raised her hand in support of abolishing private health insurance. A supporter of Medicare for all, Ms. Warren makes no apologies for taking that position. But her stance could provide ammunition to those seeking to paint her as too extreme in her progressive policies, including President Trump if she were to become the Democratic nominee. \u201cThey could teach classes in how @ewarren talks about a problem and weaves in answers into a story. She\u2019s not just wonk and stats.\u201d \u2014 Christina Reynolds, spokeswoman for Emily\u2019s List and former aide to Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, on the first debate \u201cBig difference in communication style: Sanders answers health care question by railing against the big health care companies. Warren answers by personalizing the issue, telling the story of a real person. The first is designed to rile people up. The second, to draw them in.\u201d \u2014 Mr. Elleithee on the second debate One thing is certain on Thursday night: This particular fight will not be revived, as Mr. Delaney failed to qualify for the debate.",

Elizabeth Warren went unscathed, while Kamala Harris stuck to a script.By Shane Goldmacher and Reid J. EpsteinPRINT EDITIONSeptember 12, 2019",
      "author": "Shane Goldmacher",
      "content": "  Thursday\u2019s Democratic primary debate was the first time all the leading candidates were onstage together. The most illuminating exchanges were not between Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Elizabeth Warren, who met onstage for the first time, but from other pairings. Here are six highlights from the debate. Once again this debate season, Mr. Biden came under the fiercest and most sustained scrutiny, from his ideological foes, from a former cabinet mate and even from the moderators. He was pushed on race, on deportations, on health care and, in an intense exchange, on his age. But in the end, Mr. Biden exited the stage the same way he entered it: the embattled-yet-clear front-runner, no matter if his meandering syntax and twisting verbal gymnastics sometimes failed to land clear points. One difference from the past two debates: He did begin to articulate more of his own case for the White House, rather than simply saying President Trump must be stopped. In particular, Mr. Biden came armed on the crucial topic of health care, with lines to joust with Senator Bernie Sanders and Ms. Warren over their support of an expansive Medicare for All plan. \u201cI know that the senator says she\u2019s for Bernie. Well, I\u2019m for Barack,\u201d Mr. Biden said to Ms. Warren, speaking not only about the Affordable Care Act but also the legacy of a popular former president. The Biden strategy to bearhug Mr. Obama at every opportunity was questioned by rivals, but none figured out how to drive a wedge between the two men. By evening\u2019s end, however, Mr. Biden\u2019s performance was uneven. Asked about a comment decades ago in regards to reparations for slavery \u2014 \u201cI\u2019ll be damned if I feel responsible to pay for what happened 300 years ago\u201d \u2014 he ended up talking about playing the radio for small children to expand their vocabulary, and used an outdated reference if there ever was one. \u201cMake sure you have the record player on at night,\u201d he said. It was Mr. Biden\u2019s most tweeted-about line of the night. While Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders argued to her right, and Juli\u00e1n Castro lobbed grenades at Mr. Biden from her left, Ms. Warren walked away unscathed. Nobody attacked her. Nobody questioned her electability. Nobody said anything she\u2019d done in her life was misguided. She wasn\u2019t involved in the night\u2019s most memorable exchanges. In other words, she was exactly where she wanted to be. For the one candidate in the race who has been steadily rising in the polls and seen her popularity among Democratic primary voters increase, Ms. Warren once again got off scot-free in a presidential primary debate. She didn\u2019t instigate tension with the other candidates, and nobody said anything about her. Along the way, Ms. Warren was able to define herself as the candidate with specific plans without getting into the muck of those arguing over policy specifics. This approach has fed her steady rise from the mid-single digits to a virtual tie for second place with Mr. Sanders, and it will take another debate to see if anyone in the field will try to stop her. Mr. Sanders walked onto the stage with an offensive plan \u2014  attack Mr. Biden. On health care, trade and the Iraq war, the Vermont socialist took square aim at the former vice president. It was a choreographed onslaught of Mr. Sanders\u2019s greatest hits, allowing him to argue over and over that he is the tribune of the left wing of the Democratic Party while Mr. Biden has been beholden to corporate interests and would not be a true agent of change. The question is, will it change things? Aides for both Mr. Sanders and Mr. Biden agree the two are fighting over the same subset of voters: a lower-income, less-educated set of the electorate who are not paying close attention to the day-to-day proceedings of the presidential campaign. No one is quite clear on what will happen if Mr. Biden starts bleeding support. Iowa surveys show Mr. Sanders is the leading second-choice candidate among Mr. Biden\u2019s backers. But several others \u2014 Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., most explicitly among those onstage Thursday \u2014 are touting themselves as a Biden-style unifier who can win over moderate Republicans in a general election. As for Mr. Biden, he defended himself from the Sanders onslaught and lobbed a few shots back at his fellow septuagenarian. He reminded the audience that Mr. Sanders was \u201ca socialist\u201d and suggested he had confidence in corporate America to fix the health care system, a confusing argument Mr. Sanders let be. If Senator Kamala Harris\u2019s plan in the first Miami debate was to take on Mr. Biden, her objective in Houston seemed to be to pivot to the politically safer terrain of attacking Mr. Trump. Indeed, she addressed him directly in her opening statement, ending it with this: \u201cNow, President Trump, you can go back to watching Fox News.\u201d The crowd roared. One liners are a fact of life in political debates. But string too many together in one setting and they can go from zinging to cloying, and Ms. Harris had a noticeable number of set pieces that sounded rehearsed on Thursday. (Ms. Klobuchar \u2014 \u201cHouston, we have a problem,\u201d she said in Houston \u2014 rivaled her.) The president, Ms. Harris said, \u201cconducts trade policy by tweet.\u201d And on the hate-fueled shooting in El Paso, Ms. Harris said that Mr. Trump \u201cdidn\u2019t pull the trigger, but he\u2019s certainly been tweeting out the ammunition.\u201d Those two are well-worn from Ms. Harris\u2019s appearances on the stump. She had new lines, too. \u201cHe reminds me of that guy in \u2018The Wizard of Oz.\u2019 When you pull back the curtain, it\u2019s a really small dude,\u201d she said of Mr. Trump at another point. The lines all landed individually. Collectively, they left the distinct impression of a politician. It was the line of the night, for better or worse. Mr. Castro, the former Obama housing secretary, who parried with Mr. Biden on deportation policy in the last debate, went for the jugular this time: questioning the 76-year-old\u2019s mental agility in an exchange about the particulars of health care policy. \u201cAre you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?\u201d Mr. Castro, 44, asked Mr. Biden. He then repeated himself for emphasis. \u201cAre you forgetting already what you said just two minutes ago?\u201d It was the most tweeted-about moment of the entire debate. And while others have made the case for generational change and new leadership, Mr. Castro\u2019s frontal assault on Mr. Biden\u2019s acuity, and by extension his age, left some Democrats shocked. (After the debate, Mr. Castro said on ABC, \u201cI wasn\u2019t taking a shot at his age.\u201d) Had Mr. Castro overreached in so personally going after one of the party\u2019s most popular figures? Would there be backlash? In addition, it was not clear whether Mr. Castro was even correct in his attack. Biden supporters said he was wrong; Castro aides litigated whether one could \u201cautomatically buy in\u201d to programs, as Mr. Biden said. The fact that Mr. Castro repeatedly challenged Mr. Biden throughout the night only intensified his attempted takedown of the former vice president. \u201cI\u2019m fulfilling the legacy of Barack Obama and you\u2019re not,\u201d Mr. Castro said at another point. \u201cThat,\u201d Mr. Biden shot back, \u201cwould be a surprise to him.\u201d Beto O\u2019Rourke, the one candidate whose entry and brief rise elicited the most mockery and jealousy among rival campaigns, became a figure of admiration at Thursday\u2019s debate, following his response to the mass shooting that killed 22 people at a Walmart in his hometown, El Paso. \u201cThe way he handled what happened in his hometown is meaningful,\u201d said Mr. Biden, after seemingly forgetting Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s surname. \u201cBeto, God love you for standing so courageously in the midst of that tragedy,\u201d Ms. Harris said. \u201cI so appreciate what the congressman\u2019s been doing,\u201d Ms. Klobuchar said, before she offered a disagreement with his proposal to require owners of assault-style weapons to sell them to the government. The El Paso shooting certainly changed the stature of Mr. O\u2019Rourke, who took a two-week break from the campaign trail. The former congressman has since shifted his campaign to adopt more a confrontational stance against racism and gun violence. \u201cHell yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15,\u201d he said. His campaign quickly tweeted the quip. But the praise being heaped upon Mr. O\u2019Rourke is also indicative of how far he has fallen since his March campaign launch as a presumptive front-runner on the cover of Vanity Fair. Now languishing at around 1 percent to 2 percent in most polls, he\u2019s not seen as a threat by the others.",

      "content": "  Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. jammed his finger skyward, eyes narrowing like his polling advantage, accusing the \u201csocialist\u201d to his right, Senator Bernie Sanders, and the \u201cdistinguished friend\u201d to his left, Senator Elizabeth Warren, of hawking infeasible health care proposals loaded with dubious math. Mr. Sanders, raspier than usual but no gentler on the sound system, insisted that Mr. Biden has \u201cgot to defend\u201d a status quo that bankrupts cancer patients, drawing a steely glare from a front-runner well-versed in the disease\u2019s ravages. Mayor Pete Buttigieg tried to play the peacekeeping millennial, cutting in after Juli\u00e1n Castro \u2014 the former federal housing secretary, disinclined to leave the squabbling to the three favorites \u2014 interjected from the stage\u2019s periphery to suggest  that Mr. Biden, 76, had forgotten what he said just minutes prior. \u201cThis is why presidential debates are becoming unwatchable,\u201d Mr. Buttigieg said. \u201cThis reminds everybody of what they cannot stand about Washington.\u201d \u201cYeah, that\u2019s called the Democratic primary election,\u201d Mr. Castro shot back. \u201cThat\u2019s called an election.\u201d It is getting there. Onstage together for the first time, with less than five months to go before the voting begins, the top 10 candidates made clear on Thursday that the moment for oblique contrast and above-the-fray wishcasting is quickly passing. For the favorites, the new urgency yielded the most conspicuously fractious forum yet to air the central divide in the race: whether Mr. Biden\u2019s beat-Trump-now-make-change-later relative incrementalism holds more appeal than the structural upheaval promised by Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders. [Here are six takeaways from the September Democratic debate.] Less than a year after many young and nonwhite Democrats helped lead the party to success in the midterm election, the debate also highlighted an uncomfortable truth: The top three candidates are all white septuagenarians, potentially hampering a generational argument against President Trump. For the seven other candidates in Houston \u2014 to say nothing of the more than a dozen others who have either dropped out or failed to qualify for this debate \u2014 the heightened testiness implied a determination to break through or deliver on their early promise as the campaign enters an unforgiving phase of field-culling and relevance-seeking. Some tossed out jokes at their own expense. \u201cI\u2019m the only person on this stage who finds Trudeau\u2019s hair very menacing,\u201d said a shiny-scalped Senator Cory Booker, cracking about the well-coiffed Canadian prime minister. Mr. Buttigieg said, of his time serving in Afghanistan: \u201cYou know, I served under General Dunford \u2014 way under General Dunford.\u201d Senator Amy Klobuchar came armed with one-liners: \u201cHe is treating our farmers and our workers like poker chips in one of his bankrupt casinos,\u201d she said of Mr. Trump. And Mr. Castro was eager to lash Mr. Biden over his age and his efforts to \u201ctake credit for Obama\u2019s work, but not have to answer to any questions\u201d about his administration\u2019s record. It is still early in the race, these campaigns all say. There is still time. But it is also not so early. Many Democrats have been hopeful that defeating an unpopular, rampaging president would be as simple as nominating a sentient adult with minimal political baggage. Though Mr. Biden, Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders \u2014 and lower-polling candidates like Senator Kamala Harris and Mr. Buttigieg \u2014 have outpaced Mr. Trump in some hypothetical general election surveys, party officials are cleareyed about the potential vulnerabilities dogging any of the present favorites. In certain moments \u2014 and Thursday supplied a few \u2014 it can be difficult to imagine any of the current front-runners transcending their liabilities to become the nominee. Can Mr. Biden, nostalgic and blunder-prone, really convince an anxious party that he is a man in tune with the times? Can the Brooklyn baritone of Mr. Sanders really move the masses to the political revolution he promises? Can Ms. Warren erase voters\u2019 concerns, sometimes whispered even at her own rallies, about her general election viability? \u201cThere\u2019s just a real anxiety about not making a mistake,\u201d said David Axelrod, the former chief strategist to President Barack Obama, citing the party\u2019s angst about defeating Mr. Trump. \u201cThat may raise the sensitivity to people\u2019s potential liabilities. But I think what campaigns are about in certain ways is to put these theories to the test and explore people\u2019s strengths and weaknesses and see who emerges. In 2007, there still was this chatter about \u2018can Obama actually win a general election?\u2019\u201d Mr. Biden and the two progressive senators are making radically different bets on the electorate. \u201cThere\u2019s enormous, enormous opportunities once we get rid of Donald Trump,\u201d Mr. Biden said in his opening, before pledging to build on the Affordable Care Act, unlike rivals who prefer a \u201cMedicare for all\u201d system. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear,\u201d Ms. Warren said in one exchange with Mr. Biden, joining Mr. Sanders in suggesting that the former vice president was not being bold enough, \u201cI\u2019ve actually never met anybody who likes their health insurance company.\u201d But the three do share some surface similarities as prospective opponents for Mr. Trump, aside from their age. They are all veterans of the public eye, their weaknesses familiar to many Americans. And they have all been underestimated at various points in this primary, their manifest campaign warts \u2014 Mr. Biden\u2019s gaffe-making, Ms. Warren\u2019s fraught history with Native American ancestry, Mr. Sanders\u2019s competition from Ms. Warren for liberal hearts and minds \u2014 misdiagnosed as politically lethal. For Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders, a clash at center stage was perhaps inevitable. Over their decades in Washington, they have taken divergent paths to the top of Democratic politics. Mr. Biden has played the unrepentant insider, firm in his belief that making change is a matter of gradual progress and warm relations with ideological foes. And Mr. Sanders has been the unkempt agitator, long convinced that his uncompromising liberalism would take hold through sheer force of organizing. Ms. Warren in some ways has instincts that fall between those two approaches, pushing for \u201cbig, structural change\u201d but also identifying as a capitalist and making overtures to Democratic Party leaders. Yet until Thursday night, Ms. Warren, who is rising in the polls, had not yet faced serious scrutiny on the debate stage from her most prominent rivals. That changed as a host of more centrist candidates ripped into some of the proposals she supports, especially \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d But Ms. Warren was often unruffled. She largely avoided being drawn into extended back-and-forths with her opponents, responding to overt and implicit criticisms by hewing closely to the populist progressive pitch she often makes on the trail, while also speaking in personal terms about her background. \u201cI wanted to be a public-school teacher,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I invested early, I used to line my dollies up and teach school. I had a reputation for being tough but fair.\u201d Ms. Harris, who spent the first two debates locked in several tense exchanges with Democratic opponents, sought in the third debate to bring the focus back to defeating Mr. Trump, an effort she began in her opening statement and returned to throughout the evening. \u201cThe only reason you\u2019ve not been indicted is because there was a memo in the Department of Justice that says a sitting president cannot be charged with a crime,\u201d Ms. Harris said, addressing Mr. Trump in her first moments onstage. She pledged to emphasize \u201cour common issues, our common hopes and desires and in that way, unifying our country, winning this election and turning the page for America. And now, President Trump, you can go back to watching Fox News.\u201d Later, in an exchange about trade, she compared Mr. Trump to the Wizard of Oz. \u201cWhen you pull back the curtain, it\u2019s a really small dude,\u201d she said. \u201cO.K., I\u2019m not even going to take the bait,\u201d replied George Stephanopoulos, the moderator, who stands at about 5-foot-5. \u201cOh, George. It wasn\u2019t about you!\u201d she exclaimed. The candidates did project broad agreement on issues such as the need to combat gun violence, even if consensus on specific policies such as mandatory buybacks of assault rifles proved elusive. And several of the candidates used foreign policy and trade to draw biting contrasts with the Trump administration. Some flourishes were more curious. Toward the end of the evening, Mr. Biden was read a controversial statement he had made decades ago about race, and asked about the nation\u2019s responsibility for repairing the legacy of slavery. He offered a meandering response, preaching the importance of exposing young children to as many words as possible. \u201cPlay the radio, make sure the television \u2014 excuse me, make sure you have the record player on at night,\u201d he said. On Thursday, parents were afforded another option: a debate that lasted nearly three hours.",

      "content": "  HOUSTON \u2014 Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. clung tightly to the legacy of the Obama administration in a Democratic primary debate on Thursday, asking voters to view him as a stand-in for the former president as an array of progressive challengers, led by Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, brandished more daring policy promises and questioned Mr. Biden\u2019s political strength. Facing all of his closest competitors for the first time in a debate, Mr. Biden, the Democratic front-runner, repeatedly mentioned President Barack Obama\u2019s name and policy record as a shield against rivals who suggested his own record was flawed, or implied his agenda lacked ambition. On health care, immigration, foreign wars and more, Mr. Biden\u2019s central theme was his tenure serving under Mr. Obama. By  invoking Mr. Obama, a popular figure among Democrats, Mr. Biden sought to mute the ideological and generational divisions that have left him vulnerable in the primary race. To voters who might see him as a candidate of the past, Mr. Biden seemed to counter that the past was not so bad. In an early exchange over health care, Mr. Biden referred to Ms. Warren\u2019s support for Mr. Sanders\u2019s \u201cMedicare for all\u201d plan. \u201cThe senator says she\u2019s for Bernie,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cWell, I\u2019m for Barack \u2014 I think the Obamacare worked.\u201d [Here are six takeaways from the September Democratic debate.] Explaining his preference for more incremental health care improvements, like the creation of an optional government-backed plan, Mr. Biden challenged Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders to defend the cost of their plans, warning that they would require tax increases on middle-income Americans. Mr. Biden was steadier in what was his third debate of the primary contest, rattling off statistics and parrying attacks with good cheer, though he still rambled at other moments. And despite their criticism, none of the nine other candidates onstage appeared to significantly damage his candidacy. But Mr. Biden\u2019s challengers were undeterred by his embrace of Mr. Obama, and the progressive candidates made clear the choice before primary voters. Several of them argued  \u2014 some subtly, some stridently \u2014 that the party needed to move well beyond the policies of the last Democratic president. And if Mr. Biden appealed to voters\u2019 sense of nostalgia, his rivals pressed the case for broader change. Ms. Warren, of Massachusetts, argued that her and Mr. Sanders\u2019s approach would build upon Mr. Obama\u2019s legacy rather than unraveling it. She credited Mr. Obama with having \u201cfundamentally transformed health care,\u201d but said the next president had to go further. \u201cThe question is, how best can we improve on it?\u201d Ms. Warren said, promising: \u201cCosts are going to go up for giant corporations, but for hard-working families across this country, costs are going to go down.\u201d Mr. Sanders sidestepped the mention of Mr. Obama altogether, asserting to Mr. Biden that a single-payer system would save consumers money by breaking the influence of insurers seeking to \u201cprotect their profits.\u201d \u201cAmericans don\u2019t want to pay twice as much as other countries,\u201d Mr. Sanders, of Vermont, said. Other challengers in the 10-candidate field were less diplomatic in demanding a break from the center-left policy framework that guided the Obama administration. Juli\u00e1n Castro, who served as Mr. Obama\u2019s housing secretary, echoed the news anchor Jorge Ramos in questioning the Obama administration\u2019s record of deporting millions of illegal immigrants. When Mr. Ramos pressed Mr. Biden to say whether he had made any mistakes on immigration as vice president, Mr. Biden pleaded personal loyalty. \u201cWe didn\u2019t lock people up in cages, we didn\u2019t separate families,\u201d Mr. Biden said, adding, \u201cThe president did the best thing that was able to be done.\u201d But pressed by Mr. Ramos about his own role, Mr. Biden deflected: \u201cI\u2019m the vice president of the United States,\u201d he said. That prompted an impatient reaction from Mr. Castro, who repeated a criticism previously leveled at Mr. Biden by Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey. \u201cEvery time something good about Barack Obama comes up, he says, \u2018Oh, I was there, I was there, I was there, that\u2019s me, too,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Castro, who was the most aggressive combatant against Mr. Biden on Thursday.  \u201cAnd then every time somebody questions part of the administration that we were both part of, he says, \u2018Well, that was the president.\u2019\u201d Mr. Biden, he said, \u201cwants to take credit for Obama\u2019s work, but not have to answer to any questions.\u201d Mr. Biden responded as if Mr. Castro was asserting that Mr. Biden was insufficiently defensive of the former president. \u201cI stand with Barack Obama all eight years,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cGood, bad and indifferent.\u201d Mr. Biden\u2019s fealty to Mr. Obama, throughout the debate, was consistent with his overall approach to the campaign. He has staked out a position, unapologetically, as a candidate of the Democratic center, building a sizable but far from dominant base of support, anchored in the admiration of moderates, older voters and African-Americans. But he has yet to expand his appeal beyond that base, which appears to make up between a quarter and a third of the Democratic electorate. His resilience, though, has prompted some of his rivals to recalibrate their approach as the race enters the fall. After unleashing one of the contest\u2019s toughest attacks against Mr. Biden in the first debate, Senator Kamala Harris of California steadfastly avoided critiquing the former vice president or any of her Democratic opponents. Ms. Harris used her opening statement to speak directly to, and criticize, President Trump. During the health care contretemps she lamented that \u201cnot once have we talked about Donald Trump.\u201d And when she made the case for using executive action to overcome legislative gridlock, she turned to Mr. Biden, let out a laugh and borrowed Mr. Obama\u2019s signature line. \u201cHey, Joe, let\u2019s say, \u2018Yes we can,\u2019\u201d she said. Ms. Harris\u2019s attempt at a strategic makeover was hard to miss, but other candidates also tried to show voters a fuller version of themselves. Ms. Warren stayed true to her vision for sweeping policy proposals, but she also used the debate, held in the city where she went to college, to talk more about her personal story, which many voters are only dimly aware of. She recalled her Oklahoma youth, repeatedly cited her brothers\u2019 military service and talked about being a public school teacher. If Ms. Warren seemed determined to unfurl her biography, Mr. Sanders came prepared to take on Mr. Biden. The Vermont senator was assertive about drawing contrasts between his progressive credentials and Mr. Biden\u2019s far more varied record. Where Mr. Sanders shied away from direct conflict when he shared a debate stage with Mr. Biden in June, this time he sought out areas of sharp disagreement, including over the NAFTA trade deal and the war in Iraq. Mr. Biden supported both; Mr. Sanders opposed them. [We fact-checked what the candidates said at the Democratic debate.] The Democratic Party\u2019s lively, sometimes heated internal disagreements were on vivid display throughout the night, on subjects as diverse as gun control, trade with China, the war in Afghanistan and the Senate filibuster. And if the clearest philosophical gulf separated Mr. Biden from the prominent populists who flanked him \u2014 Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren \u2014  the debate made plain that the party was in the midst of a far more complex process of defining its identity. The remaining field of candidates arrayed themselves around the same philosophical dividing line, most of them aligning more closely with Mr. Biden. And for the first time in this primary race, a few of the trailing contenders sharpened their attacks. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota derided Mr. Sanders\u2019s single-payer health care bill as a \u201cbad idea,\u201d while Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., accused Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren of seeking to take away choice from consumers. \u201cI trust the American people to make the right choice for them,\u201d Mr. Buttigieg said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you?\u201d A harshly contentious clash between Mr. Biden and Mr. Castro provided one of the most heated exchanges of the evening, at least in terms of political theatrics. Seizing on a moment in which Mr. Biden described his health care proposals imprecisely, Mr. Castro questioned Mr. Biden\u2019s memory \u2014 a charged subject for the former vice president, who is 76. \u201cAre you forgetting already what you said two minutes ago?\u201d Mr. Castro said, prodding insistently before boasting, \u201cI\u2019m fulfilling the legacy of Barack Obama and you\u2019re not.\u201d Mr. Biden shot back, \u201cThat would be a surprise to him.\u201d (The former vice president did, however, show his fondness for a bygone era later in the forum when he dropped in a reference to record players.) There was more consensus on the stage when it came to praising the leadership of former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas in the aftermath of the mass shooting last month in El Paso, his hometown. And Mr. O\u2019Rourke won a booming ovation from the audience when he was asked whether he would try to confiscate some weapons. \u201cHell, yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to allow it to be used against fellow Americans anymore.\u201d Mr. Booker, who lives in Newark, said the outrage over gun violence was long overdue. \u201cI\u2019m sorry that it had to take issues coming to my neighborhood or personally affecting Beto to suddenly make us demand change,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a crisis of empathy in our nation. We are never going to solve this crisis if we have to wait for it to personally affect us or our neighborhood or our community before we demand action.\u201d There were, though, plenty of lighter moments in Houston. Mr. Booker, a vegan, assured viewers he would not push Americans away from eating meat. \u201cFirst of all I want to say: No,\u201d he said, before adding with a touch of comedic timing, \u201cI want to translate that into Spanish: No.\u201d Ms. Harris drew titters for saying Mr. Trump \u201creminds me of that guy in \u2018The Wizard of Oz,\u2019\u201d adding that \u201cwhen you pull back the curtain, it\u2019s a really small dude.\u201d And Andrew Yang left many of his competitors onstage all but speechless when he used his opening statement to unveil a new gambit aimed at drawing attention to his proposal to offer Americans a universal basic income. \u201cMy campaign will now give a freedom dividend of $1,000 a month for an entire year to 10 American families, someone watching this at home right now,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you believe that you can solve your own problems better than any politician, go to yang2020.com and tell us how $1,000 a month will help you do just that.\u201d ",

They are struggling to differentiate themselves from a president they say has a feckless, isolationist view of American power.By David E. Sanger and Maggie AstorPRINT EDITIONSome Democrats Join Trump in Seeking Quick Exit|September 17, 2019, Page A12",
      "author": "David E. Sanger",
      "content": "  For 18 years and four presidential elections, Democrats running for president have felt compelled to lay out comprehensive plans for the future of Afghanistan, vowing to never again let the country become a breeding ground for terrorists who could strike the United States as they did on Sept. 11, 2001. Now, the candidates are racing one another \u2014 and President Trump \u2014 to demonstrate how quickly they would end the long-running conflict. In the debate on Thursday night, there was almost no discussion of American goals for the country, like building a democracy or protecting the rights of women \u2014 objectives that were staples of past Democratic campaigns. It is a striking change. Even while deeply opposing President George W. Bush\u2019s war in Iraq, Democrats saw Afghanistan as the good war, prompted by a direct attack on the United States. President Barack Obama ordered a surge in American forces by the end of his first year in office. But as the years went by, he had growing doubts, and now Democrats have fully embraced those misgivings and want out. Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. are so eager for the United States to depart that they say they would pull out combat troops even in the absence of an agreement with the Taliban. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing right now in Afghanistan is not helping the safety and security of the United States,\u201d Ms. Warren said during the debate. \u201cIt is not helping the safety and security of the world. It is not helping the safety and security of Afghanistan.\u201d \u201cWe cannot ask our military to keep solving problems that cannot be solved militarily,\u201d she added. A foreign policy adviser to Mr. Sanders, who has said he would withdraw all American troops from Afghanistan in his first term as president, echoed that argument in an interview on Friday, saying that while Mr. Sanders supported negotiations with the Taliban, the next president should be \u201cmodest about what we, the United States, can actually achieve given that we\u2019ve been there for almost two decades.\u201d Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., and the only candidate to have served in Afghanistan, acknowledged during an interview over the weekend that what the Democrats missed last week was any discussion of what the United States still wanted or needed to achieve in Afghanistan \u2014 the first step toward determining what kind of presence to have on the ground. \u201cI will say I agree that didn\u2019t come through in the debate,\u201d said Mr. Buttigieg, who has pledged to withdraw the troops within a year of taking office, but only with a substantive peace deal with the Taliban. \u201cIt almost came across as if the candidates think there is no point to being there, which is not how I view it.\u201d Mr. Buttigieg said that could be a reflection of wariness over \u201cendless war,\u201d and the confusion generated by a conflict in which the American goals have often seemed to shift. He recalled that when he exercised at the gym at the headquarters of the international security force in Kabul,  he would stare at a large graphic that had \u201ceight lines of effort on it, and it was very hard to understand what the scope of the mission was.\u201d Yet even the central goal of protecting the American homeland from another attack, a staple of John Kerry\u2019s run for the presidency in 2004 and Mr. Obama\u2019s in 2008, barely gets a mention now. Mr. Kerry told The New York Times in 2004 that any effective Afghanistan plan \u201crequires destroying terrorists. And I\u2019m committed to doing that. But I think I have a better way of doing it.\u201d Five years later, Mr. Obama overruled warnings from his ambassador in Kabul that his administration\u2019s plan to surge troops into the country, then depend on the Afghan government to defend itself, would probably not work. Speaking at West Point, Mr. Obama said he had \u201cdetermined that it is in our vital national interest to send an additional 30,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan. After 18 months, our troops will begin to come home.\u201d Quietly, his White House set up an \u201cAfghan Good Enough\u201d committee to find an exit. The current presidential candidates seem uninterested in revisiting those decisions. Instead, they race to reassure voters about how quickly they would bring the remaining 14,000 troops home. To some Democrats who devoted years to stabilizing Afghanistan, the candidates are losing an opportunity to take on Mr. Trump for what they view as a feckless foreign policy, one in which the president is trying to rush through a bare-bones peace agreement with the Taliban so that he can announce major troop withdrawals before the 2020 election. \u201cIt would be unworthy of the U.S. to leave the Afghan people and government to the mercies of the Taliban in an unequal agreement,\u201d R. Nicholas Burns, a former under secretary of state for policy and now an adviser to Mr. Biden, said over the weekend. As ambassador to NATO in the early years of the war, Mr. Burns took allies to Afghanistan to persuade them to join the coalition, declaring that it was in their own interest to stabilize the country, where 2,400 Americans have died in combat, along with 1,000 troops from NATO and other nations. \u201cTrump has displayed astonishingly weak negotiating skills by signaling to the Taliban his desperation to withdraw American forces ahead of the 2020 election,\u201d he said. But if the Taliban were tuned into the recent debates, or were reviewing the positions the candidates have posted on their websites, they would most likely conclude that no matter who gets elected, they are on the verge of achieving their central goal: getting American forces out of the country. Mr. Biden himself, a voice for more rapid withdrawal during the Obama administration, now advocates keeping an intelligence presence \u2014 though in the debate he said it would be across the border in Pakistan. \u201cWe can prevent the United States from being the victim of terror coming out of Afghanistan by providing for bases \u2014 insist the Pakistanis provide bases for us to airlift from and to move against what we know,\u201d Mr. Biden said after one of the moderators quoted Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, saying that Afghanistan still needed military support to prevent violence. \u201cWe don\u2019t need those troops there. I would bring them home.\u201d Mr. Biden\u2019s longtime national security adviser, Antony Blinken, refined that on Sunday, saying the candidate would \u201cdraw down our combat forces and narrowly focus the mission on counterterrorism, with small numbers of special operators and intelligence assets in and around Afghanistan. He would rally the world to support Afghans\u2019 human rights and continued development efforts.\u201d Senator Kamala Harris of California said in an interview with The Times this year that while she supported withdrawing troops, she believed the United States needed some sort of continued presence in Afghanistan to support the government and stop terrorists from regrouping. \u201cThe question is the type of presence,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that it is completely appropriate that we would give support to the Afghan government in terms of helping them train their troops and thinking about how we can provide assistance so that they can have their own people up and running in a way that they keep their country secure, and in particular prevent it from becoming a haven\u201d for terrorists. One of the curious elements of the presidential campaign is that Afghanistan has been the only foreign policy issue actively debated among Democrats. There has been little to no debate about the far bigger strategic questions raised by the revival of superpower tensions with Russia and China. The growing confrontation with Iran and the president\u2019s dealings with Kim Jong-un of North Korea have barely been mentioned. Perhaps that is because the Afghan conundrum is so familiar to voters, and goes to a central question: When would these aspirants for the Oval Office use traditional military force? Mr. Buttigieg \u2014 noting that Congress\u2019s 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force has allowed the war in Afghanistan to continue for so long that, very soon, the soldiers fighting it will include people who were not born when the law was passed \u2014 said that as president, he would put a three-year limit on such authorizations and require a congressional vote to renew them for longer. \u201cIf there\u2019s one thing we\u2019ve learned from Afghanistan,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s that the best way not to be caught up in endless war is to avoid starting one in the first place.\u201d None of the candidates seem particularly impressed by the argument that withdrawing troops would create a vacuum in Afghanistan for the Taliban and other terrorist groups to fill. \u201cIt\u2019s a false choice to say we need an enduring combat presence in Afghanistan or we open ourselves to an unmanageable terrorist threat,\u201d a spokeswoman for Ms. Warren said. \u201cInternational terrorism is a worldwide challenge, and it is best confronted not with boots on the ground in Afghanistan, but instead with diplomacy and intelligence and through coordination with partners and allies.\u201d Mr. Sanders would continue the United States\u2019 intelligence presence in Afghanistan, according to his campaign, but focus on humanitarian and developmental incentives, not military pressure, to bring the Taliban to the table and reach a peace deal. He and Ms. Warren  made very similar arguments. \u201cI was in Afghanistan with John McCain two years ago this past summer,\u201d Ms. Warren said at the debate. \u201cWe talked to people on the ground and asked the question, the same one I ask on the Senate Armed Services Committee every time one of the generals comes through: \u2018Show me what winning looks like. Tell me what it looks like.\u2019 And what you hear is a lot of \u2018Uh,\u2019 because no one can describe it. And the reason no one can describe it is because the problems in Afghanistan are not problems that can be solved by a military.\u201d",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is 76 years old and prone to sometimes-rambling monologues with antiquated references. But if his age and missteps are supposed to be liabilities, they haven\u2019t helped rivals who have tried to use them to their advantage. Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former housing secretary, was the latest to learn that the hard way, taking direct aim at Mr. Biden\u2019s age, and memory, in last Thursday\u2019s debate. It didn\u2019t work for Mr. Castro \u2014 amid a backlash, he lost a key endorsement over the weekend \u2014 and it hasn\u2019t worked throughout the 2020 campaign. While younger candidates have presented themselves as agents of generational change, it is three septuagenarians who have emerged as the front-runners: Mr. Biden, 78-year-old Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and 70-year-old Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. They have generated the most support and enthusiasm, and taken their place in the top tier of the polls as they seek to challenge a president who is 73 himself. And neither their age, nor Mr. Biden\u2019s sometimes unsteady speaking performance, has convinced voters to get behind other candidates perceived as untested on the national stage. \u201cI ran a generational campaign that wanted to take on issues that were affecting my generation and future generations,\u201d said Representative Eric Swalwell of California, who centered his presidential campaign around gun violence and student debt before withdrawing in July. \u201cThose issues are really important, but beating Donald Trump is the most important thing that most voters want. I just sensed that they weren\u2019t going to roll the dice on a generational candidate.\u201d The debate last week produced further scrutiny of age as a factor in the primary. Within days, Mr. Biden, Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren were all asked whether they would release their medical records \u2014 and said they would. Even a hoarse voice that forced Mr. Sanders to cancel some events Monday and Tuesday was subject to some age-related speculation. Mr. Biden\u2019s debate performance left him once again open to questions about his age and acuity. He bungled the name of Moms Demand Action, the nation\u2019s leading gun control group. He answered a question about institutional racism with a rambling tangent that included the suggestion that parents \u201cmake sure you have the record player on at night.\u201d During the July debate, Mr. Biden forgot whether he was directing voters to his website or signing them up to receive text messages from the campaign. Some voters have noticed. \u201cI want Joe Biden to be able to complete a sentence better than I can,\u201d said Melanie Gee, 58, a retired antiques dealer who attended a women\u2019s event in Birmingham, Ala., on Monday. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s senile. I just think he\u2019s not as a sharp as I want him to be.\u201d Yvette Simpson, the chief executive of Democracy for America, a liberal group, said she worried about Mr. Biden\u2019s ability to \u201cdeliver a clear message at a time when a clear message is important to the American people.\u2019\u2019 But while Mr. Biden\u2019s missteps have at times put him on the defensive, his rivals have struggled to frame them in a way that diminishes him and enhances their own candidacies. Sometimes it just looks meanspirited. Mr. Castro took the starkest shot yet at Mr. Biden\u2019s capabilities during a heated exchange over health care policy at the debate. \u201cAre you forgetting already what you said just two minutes ago?\u201d Mr. Castro said, repeating himself three times. It had the effect of thrusting out into the open a fact that has been the subtext of other candidates\u2019 strategies for months. Later that night, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey also expressed reservations about Mr. Biden, telling CNN that \u201cthere are definitely moments when you listen to Joe Biden and you just wonder.\u201d The attacks failed. By Sunday, Mr. Booker had backed off his Biden criticism \u2014 not the first time he\u2019d done so during the campaign. And Representative Vicente Gonz\u00e1lez of Texas defected from supporting Mr. Castro to Mr. Biden, in part because of Mr. Castro\u2019s provocative questions on the debate stage, according to people familiar with his decision. \u201cIf you\u2019re polling in the low single digits and you\u2019re not raising any resources and you\u2019re fracturing your party and you\u2019re just getting your supporters to be upset at other candidates, it certainly can\u2019t be a good thing for our party,\u201d Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez said Sunday on CNN, alluding to Mr. Castro\u2019s attack. At the same time, Mr. Biden\u2019s defenders become protective of him when pressed with questions about his age. Former Senator Barbara Boxer of California, who is neutral in the 2020 primary, said criticisms of Mr. Biden\u2019s age are \u201cageist.\u201d \u201cHe started off very strong and as it went on, he was trying to get in too many things, too many facts,\u201d Ms. Boxer, 78, said of Mr. Biden\u2019s debate performance. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard standing there for three hours. I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re 55 years old.\u201d \u201cThat is just political attacks, right now people trying to figure out any way to try to knock the front-runner down,\u201d Senator Doug Jones of Alabama said Sunday after attending a church service with Mr. Biden, whom he backs. \u201cJoe\u2019s going to be Joe. And that\u2019s why people love him, and they know his history.\u201d There has been a clear recalibration among the second-tier candidates, who seem to have realized that drawing clear age contrasts with Mr. Biden \u2014 as Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., had been doing since his campaign began \u2014 is a losing strategy. And not all of Mr. Biden\u2019s younger rivals are eager to stress their age difference. \u201cWho the hell cares,\u201d Beto O\u2019Rourke said Sunday on \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d \u201cThe last thing I care about is Joe Biden\u2019s age.\u201d For Mr. Biden, no concern is raised more consistently by voters than his age, a subject Mr. Biden himself has said is fair game. When asked by reporters for his response, he often instructs voters to watch him in action on the trail, where he has made shows of physical force by sprinting through parades or lingering late into the evening to shake hands.  In July, Mr. Biden\u2019s doctor said that he was in \u201cexcellent physical condition.\u201d Black voters, who comprise a critical bloc of Mr. Biden\u2019s support, are not punishing him for his age, said Adrianne Shropshire, the executive director of BlackPAC, a super PAC focused on African-American Democrats. The black primary electorate skews older and is sympathetic to Mr. Biden\u2019s age, she said. \u201cA lot of the age critique centers on cultural issues, record players and texting, which many of those voters struggle with as well but don\u2019t see as disqualifying,\u201d Ms. Shropshire said. Mr. Sanders, who is 15 months older than Mr. Biden, and Ms. Warren do not face the degree of scrutiny about their age that Mr. Biden does, even as some voters at their events admit they would like to see someone younger elected president. Mr. Sanders\u2019s events are high-energy affairs, punctuated by the senator frequently waving his arms to emphasize his points. It also helps that he rarely deviates from themes in his stump speech, affording him far fewer opportunities to make off-the-cuff gaffes. Still, he lost his voice during a campaign swing through Iowa and Colorado last week \u2014 a fact that became evident to millions watching last week\u2019s debate. \u201cI kind of lost my voice somewhere in Colorado, and I hope I don\u2019t have to go back there right away to find it again,\u201d he joked Saturday in Las Vegas. Some on the Sanders team have acknowledged privately that his raspiness is not his best look. The Sanders campaign cut short a planned swing through South Carolina on Monday and Tuesday. The campaign said he was \u201cfeeling great\u201d but would return home to Vermont to \u201crest his vocal cords.\u201d Among the three candidates in their 70s atop the polls, Ms. Warren is the most crisp when speaking to crowds and fielding questions on the debate stage. \u201cThe medical records will be there, and anybody\u2019s welcome to take a look at them,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd what I\u2019m hoping is, we\u2019re going to get to do a lot more town halls between now and then, and more after that.\u201d If Ms. Warren wants her town halls and public appearances to speak for themselves on her stamina, she is likely aware that her entrances and exits are part of the case. She sprints as she enters campaign events. A video of her jogging across a grassy field at an event in New Hampshire last month went viral, and she was even caught on camera running into Penn Station in New York to catch a train earlier this year. \u201cAge is a figure of speech,\u201d said Harry Reid, the former Senate Democratic leader, who is 79. \u201cI think it\u2019s an exaggeration to start crossing people off the list because they\u2019re 70 years old.\u201d",

      "content": "  The Democratic field got a little bit smaller this week, shrinking to 19 candidates. Here\u2019s our weekly catch-up on the 2020 election and some moments you may have missed. Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York, who entered the Democratic presidential race on the hopes that his brand of urban progressive leadership could appeal on a national scale, said on Friday that he was ending his candidacy. Mr. de Blasio\u2019s campaign never quite caught on, and his announcement came less than two weeks before the qualification deadline for the October debate. His inclusion in the event was growing less likely by the day. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve contributed all I can to this primary campaign, and it\u2019s clearly not my time,\u201d he said in an appearance on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m going to end my presidential campaign, continue my work as mayor of New York City, and I\u2019m going to keep speaking up for working people.\u201d Monday was big for Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. She received the endorsement of the Working Families Party, a labor-aligned progressive group that endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont during the last presidential cycle. She released a 6,000-word anti-corruption plan, which would make the release of tax returns automatic for candidates for federal office, make it illegal for elected officials to become lobbyists and strengthen ethics requirements for federal judges. And in a speech at a rally in Manhattan that drew thousands to Washington Square Park, she forcefully attacked corruption and invoked the power of women to bring about sweeping change. Ms. Warren delivered the speech blocks from the site of the Triangle shirtwaist factory fire of 1911, which killed 146 garment workers, most of them immigrant women. It was one of the deadliest industrial disasters in the nation\u2019s history. \u201cThe tragic story of the Triangle factory fire is a story about power,\u201d Ms. Warren said. \u201cA story of what happens when the rich and the powerful take control of government and use it to increase their own profits while they stick it to working people. But what happened in the aftermath of the fire is a different story about power \u2014 a story about our power, a story about what\u2019s possible when we fight together as one.\u201d With five months to go before the New Hampshire primary, Mr. Sanders overhauled his operations in the state, which he won by more than 22 percentage points in 2016. Mr. Sanders, who hails from neighboring Vermont, almost certainly must win New Hampshire again next year to have a chance at the nomination. The campaign also parted ways with its political director in Iowa, according to a report that surfaced later in the week. Read more about that move here. Several candidates called for the impeachment of Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh after The New York Times published new information about allegations of sexual misconduct against him. Ms. Warren, Mr. Sanders and Senator Kamala Harris of California were among those who called for the justice\u2019s impeachment. \u201cHe was put on the Court through a sham process and his place on the Court is an insult to the pursuit of truth and justice,\u201d Ms. Harris wrote. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. called the revelations \u201cprofoundly troubling\u201d but stopped short of demanding impeachment. Instead, he called for an investigation into \u201cwhether the Trump administration and Senate Republicans pressured the F.B.I. to ignore evidence.\u201d Former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas released a plan on Thursday to legalize marijuana, expunge all possession convictions and regulate the substance the way alcohol is regulated. Sales would be limited to adults, smoking would be banned in public areas, and advertising would be restricted. He also wants to tax the marijuana industry and invest the revenue in the communities of color disproportionately affected by the war on drugs. Every Democratic candidate supports decriminalizing marijuana, and most, including Mr. O\u2019Rourke, support full legalization. But six candidates \u2014 Mr. Biden, Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana, Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Mayor Wayne Messam of Miramar, Fla., and former Representative Joe Sestak of Pennsylvania \u2014 want to leave the question of legalization up to the states. Overheard on the campaign trail? \u201cI\u2019m moving to Iowa,\u201d Ms. Harris joked in a comment to Senator Mazie Hirono of Hawaii that included an expletive and was overheard by a reporter. The state of California did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Ms. Harris\u2019s remark came as her campaign announced a new push in the state. In a call with reporters Thursday morning, aides said they hoped to position Ms. Harris for a late-breaking Iowa surge. And they set a firm target: a top-three finish. Ms. Harris\u2019s team sent out a fund-raising email based on her quip. And, of course, there are already T-shirts.",

      "content": "  DES MOINES \u2014 Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts is the new Iowa polling leader, narrowly in first place ahead of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., according to a new poll of the state from The Des Moines Register and CNN. The poll showed that Ms. Warren was the first choice for 22 percent of would-be Democratic caucusgoers, a significant increase from the 15 percent support she held in June, when The Register last polled the state. Mr. Biden dropped from a first-place June showing of 24 percent to 20 percent. The result left the two in a statistical tie, well ahead of the rest of the pack. The poll is the latest evidence of Ms. Warren\u2019s political rise in the 2020 race. Alone among the 2020 candidates, her campaign stops have become bona fide events, with 20,000 people attending a speech in Manhattan this week and 2,000 turning out in Iowa City on Thursday night. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont placed third with 11 percent, the second consecutive poll from The Register in which his campaign has seen precipitous decreases in support. Mr. Sanders, who placed in a statistical tie with Hillary Clinton in the state\u2019s 2016 contest, had 25 percent support in the paper\u2019s March poll and 16 percent support in June. Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., placed fourth in The Register\u2019s poll, with 9 percent. He had 14 percent in The Register\u2019s June poll and has fallen in other surveys of the state since then before launching a television advertising campaign here after Labor Day. The gains by Ms. Warren come largely at the expense of Mr. Sanders. His polling drop-off comes as his campaign has reordered staff in early nominating states in an effort to reboot his campaign. Senator Kamala Harris of California was fifth overall with 6 percent support. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota each had 3 percent support. Four candidates were the first choice of 2 percent of likely Iowa caucusgoers. In addition to leading the field, Ms. Warren also has the most room for growth in the field \u2014 71 percent of Democrats surveyed said she was their first or second choice or they were open to backing her, the poll found. Mr. Biden was next, being considered by 60 percent of Iowa Democrats. Of the rest of the field, only Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Harris were being considered by more than half the Democratic electorate. The dynamics are far from set: Just one in five likely Democratic caucusgoers said their minds were made up, and 63 percent said they could still be persuaded to support a different candidate. The poll surveyed 602 likely Democratic caucusgoers by telephone Sept. 14-18, and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points. It was released after 17 Democratic presidential candidates appeared Saturday at the Polk County Steak Fry, an annual political event that drew 12,000 activists and voters to a Des Moines park for several hours of political speeches, campaign singalongs and freshly grilled meats. The poll, like the Steak Fry event, illustrated the increasingly condensed nature of the 2020 Democratic presidential contest. The poll found just five candidates registering more than 3 percent support, while those who braved the drizzling conditions and threat of thunderstorms congregated around the candidates who emerged hours later atop the polls. The event\u2019s largest applause came for Ms. Warren, who repeated a forceful call for President Trump\u2019s impeachment, and Mr. Buttigieg, who was followed by a yellow-clad cadre of highly enthusiastic supporters. Mr. Biden, whose campaign purchased the largest allotment of Steak Fry tickets, entered the event with a marching band and scores of campaign aides and volunteers. The lower-polling contenders for the most part roamed the grounds of Water Works Park here unencumbered. Mr. Biden was not the only candidate bringing some flash to the event. Supporters of the former housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro danced to a mariachi band, backers of former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke pushed a boat out into the nearby lake, Ms. Warren took 1,050 selfies and Ms. Klobuchar blasted the music of Prince, a Minnesota hero. For some, the event may mark one of their last major appearances in the state. Mr. Booker sent out a plea to donors today saying that unless he raises $1.7 million over the next 10 days, he will be unable to remain in the race. He\u2019s not alone in being in danger of running out of cash.",

      "author": "Reid J. Epstein",
      "content": " WEBSTER CITY, Iowa \u2014 Iowa\u2019s presidential caucuses disenfranchise huge blocs of voters. The state is 91 percent white. It is not easy to get to, or get around in. But to a greater degree than in recent campaigns, this unrepresentative and idiosyncratic state is proving that it is the only electoral battleground that matters for Democrats from now until caucus night on Feb. 3. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s campaign said it would have 110 staff members in the state by the end of this month. Senator Kamala Harris has promised to visit every week in October. Mayor Pete Buttigieg on Sunday kicked off a John McCain-like, everything-on-the-record bus tour and is advertising on local television and radio. Senator Amy Klobuchar is 49 counties into her tour of all 99 in the state. And on Monday, Senator Bernie Sanders will begin a \u201cBernie Beats Trump\u2019\u2019 tour of eastern Iowa to highlight what he says is his strength as a general election candidate. As a new poll suggested a significant shift in the primary race\u2019s top tier \u2014 with Senator Elizabeth Warren overtaking Mr. Biden for first place \u2014 candidates at the annual Polk County Steak Fry in Des Moines on Saturday tried to cut through the furor surrounding President Trump, Ukraine and Mr. Biden to deliver their message to voters still sifting through their preferences from one of the largest fields in history. The candidates\u2019 renewed sense of urgency has set the stage for a four-month sprint to a night of caucuses that remains the single biggest prize in American politics. \u201cWe know that Iowa is where we can turn heads,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Buttigieg, of South Bend, Ind., said aboard his campaign bus on Sunday. \u201cEven the other early states will be looking at what Iowa did.\u201d The increasing focus on Iowa, where voters must attend an hourslong midwinter evening gathering to participate in choosing their party\u2019s nominee, has come at the expense of New Hampshire, where the nation\u2019s first primary election comes eight days later. None of the Democratic presidential candidates are betting their entire campaigns on a strong performance in New Hampshire, meaning it may be the first time since 1984 that there is not a candidate focused solely on the Granite State in a contested presidential race. With so many candidates running, much remains unsettled. And both Iowa and New Hampshire have a history of lifting underdog candidates, with John Kerry rising from the single digits to a caucus victory in 2004 and Bill Clinton declaring himself the \u201ccomeback kid\u201d when he finished second in New Hampshire\u2019s 1992 primary contest. Yet those examples, like others often cited by this year\u2019s back-of-the-pack candidates, took place before presidential campaigns had become entirely nationalized. Nowadays, Democrats at campaign rallies in rural Iowa are more likely to recite talking points they have heard on cable news or social media than something they read in their local newspaper. Collectively, the 10 Democrats who appeared on the debate stage in Houston this month have spent more than twice as much money on Facebook advertisements targeted to Iowans since June 29 than to people in New Hampshire, Nevada or South Carolina, according to data from Bully Pulpit Interactive, a Democratic political firm. No candidate in the race has a bigger chasm between online investments in the first two nominating states than Ms. Harris, of California, who since June 29 has spent $115,178 on Facebook ads in Iowa, but just $2,164 on such ads in New Hampshire. After some grumbling that she had gone more than a month since last visiting the state, Ms. Harris was overheard last week saying she was \u201cmoving to Iowa,\u201d with an expletive added for emphasis. Her team announced last week that it would add 60 new staff members and open 10 new offices, and she plans to return weekly until Halloween. Her campaign manager told reporters she was aiming for a \u201ctop three\u201d finish in the state. The historically large field has left even the candidates unclear about how many Democrats will have a plausible claim to continue on to New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. Ms. Harris called a third place showing a goal but said she did not know if a failure to meet that threshold would doom her campaign. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t know,\u201d she said in an interview before a campaign stop on Friday in Cedar Falls. \u201cI think it will be a confluence of factors that ultimately decides how long anyone stays in and what that means.\u201d A new poll from The Des Moines Register and CNN, released on Saturday night, showed a reordering of the Democratic field. For the first time in The Register\u2019s poll this year, Ms. Warren, of Massachusetts, at 22 percent support, led Mr. Biden, who the survey found was the first choice of 20 percent of would-be caucusgoers. Mr. Sanders, of Vermont, placed third, at 11 percent, with Mr. Buttigieg at 9 percent and Ms. Harris at 6 percent. \u201cThis is the first major shake-up\u201d of the race, The Register\u2019s pollster, Ann Selzer, told the paper. The poll found that just one in five likely caucusgoers said they had made up their minds, and 63 percent could still be persuaded to shift their support to someone else. Ms. Klobuchar, of Minnesota, who was tied for sixth in the poll, said after presiding over the opening of a new campaign office on Friday in Cedar Rapids that there might be more than twice as many tickets out of Iowa as usual. \u201cYou could be No. 6,\u201d Ms. Klobuchar said before the poll results were announced. \u201cI\u2019m really serious, in a 20-person field and people will go, \u2018Not bad.\u2019 They\u2019re going to look at who is in the top eight.\u201d Mr. Buttigieg predicted a smaller number of candidates would survive Iowa. \u201cI don\u2019t know how many people can emerge, I think that comes down to how many people voters can keep track of,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d be shocked if it\u2019s more than five.\u201d At the moment, all of the Democratic candidates are chasing Ms. Warren. She is drawing the largest crowds in the field \u2014 2,000 came to see her on Thursday night in Iowa City, two hours after and three miles away from a stop by Ms. Harris in Coralville that drew about 200 to a brewery. Ms. Warren declined on Sunday to take a victory lap over her new Iowa polling standing. \u201cI don\u2019t do polls,\u201d she said in Detroit, where she marched with striking autoworkers outside a General Motors plant. \u201cWe are still months away from the Iowa caucuses and the first primary elections.\u201d A cadre of challengers to Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren are augmenting their Iowa operations, adding staff, opening new offices, collecting endorsements and starting new fund-raising appeals as they aim to create the aura of momentum while building organizations to turn out supporters for the state\u2019s Feb. 3 caucuses. Ms. Klobuchar, from neighboring Minnesota, has support from more current and former Iowa state lawmakers than any other 2020 presidential candidate, according to Iowa Starting Line, a local political news website. And Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, who tied with Ms. Klobuchar in The Register\u2019s poll, issued an S.O.S. to supporters over the weekend, saying that without an infusion of $1.7 million by the end of the month his campaign might no longer be viable. While Democrats elsewhere in the country, representing a national party that is increasingly diverse, offer quadrennial grumbling about Iowa, officials here aim to use their status to force the presidential candidates to focus on local issues. J. D. Scholten, a Democrat running for the seat held by Representative Steve King in a 39-county section of northwest Iowa, said he will soon schedule campaign stops across his district with each of the presidential campaigns in towns of 1,000 people or less to test their appeal to rural voters. \u201cI really want to see the engagement,\u201d Mr. Scholten said at the steak fry on Saturday, which drew a crowd of more than 12,000 people. \u201cI think that\u2019s where I\u2019ll see. No polling can tell me, nothing like that. I want to see whether the people\u2019s heads nod or not.\u201d",

But now, as the United Automobile Workers, one of the nation\u2019s largest unions, stages a strike that has even drawn words of support from President Trump, Democrats are seizing the moment to align themselves with workers in public and dramatic ways. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts walked the picket line Sunday alongside striking General Motors workers at an assembly plant in Detroit. Not to be outdone, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. appeared at another G.M. assembly plant in Kansas City, Kan. The picket line visits of two of the leading candidates for the Democratic nomination \u2014 with the third, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, planning to join striking workers in Detroit on Wednesday \u2014 illustrated the importance to Democrats of winning the support of rank-and-file union members, including those who voted for Mr. Trump in 2016. Taking her message of fighting inequality to Michigan for the fourth time since June, Ms. Warren joined a scrum of striking autoworkers, carrying a blue and white \u201cU.A.W. on Strike\u201d sign. As they crisscrossed the entrance to the Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly Plant, where Cadillacs and Chevrolets are built, the workers chanted, \u201cWe are the union, the mighty, mighty union. U.A.W. stand strong.\u201d Ms. Warren criticized G.M. for closing plants while making billions of dollars in profits. \u201cG.M. is demonstrating that it has no loyalty to the workers of America or the people of America,\u201d she said. \u201cTheir only loyalty is to their own bottom line. And if they can save a nickel by moving a job to Mexico or to Asia or to anywhere else on this planet, they will do it.\u201d \u201cEverybody deserves a living wage in this country,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear, unions built America\u2019s middle class and unions will rebuild America\u2019s middle class.\u201d U.A.W. leaders in Detroit voted unanimously a week ago to authorize the strike, the union\u2019s first such walkout since 2007. The union is pushing G.M. to raise wages, reopen some plants and add jobs at others, and narrow the pay gap between new hires and veteran workers. Nearly 50,000 members have joined picket lines at factories across the South and the Midwest. Every major Democratic presidential candidate has expressed support for the striking workers, and several have visited picket lines to appeal to union members who may have switched their support to Mr. Trump. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota joined the one in Detroit on Thursday, while Representative Tim Ryan of Ohio traveled to several in his home state and in Flint, Mich. Addressing the striking U.A.W. workers in Kansas City on Sunday afternoon, Mr. Biden wore a red T-shirt in solidarity. He referenced the bailout of General Motors during the Obama administration, telling the crowd, \u201cWe didn\u2019t bail out GM, U.A.W. bailed out GM!\u201d He went on to lament the high pay of executives at the company and the lack of equitable benefits for workers, and he encouraged the striking workers, acknowledging, \u201cyou\u2019re making a hell of a sacrifice.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s only one reason we have a middle class, and it\u2019s spelled \u2018U-N-I-O-N,\u2019\u201d he said. The crowd cheered. Auto-worker support for the Democratic Party has eroded slightly in recent years, and about 30 percent of the union\u2019s rank and file were estimated to have voted for Mr. Trump in 2016, slightly more than the share who voted for the two previous Republican presidential nominees. The departure of those voters from the Democratic Party, even as the union had officially endorsed Hillary Clinton, was particularly critical to Mr. Trump in Michigan, where he won by the thinnest of margins \u2014 less than 11,000 votes \u2014 to capture the state\u2019s 16 electoral votes. Nearly three years later, it is unclear how many of those union workers continue to back the president. The economy has generally remained strong here, with unemployment near a 20-year low. Representative Debbie Dingell, a Democrat who represents a district just outside of Detroit that is home to several auto manufacturing facilities, said she felt that Mr. Trump\u2019s support among autoworkers had held roughly steady. But she said she believed that a prolonged strike could move the president\u2019s numbers among such workers in one direction or the other, depending on whether they viewed him as trying to help or hurt them. \u201cIf he\u2019s perceived as trying to keep the plants open, and it\u2019s successful, it could have a positive impact,\u201d Ms. Dingell said. In 2016, Ms. Dingell was a lonely voice among Michigan Democrats as she raised concerns that Mr. Trump could carry the state, even going so far as to hold a meeting with Democratic legislators in her district several weeks before the election warning them not to underestimate his appeal. Ms. Dingell said she had heard frequently from autoworkers at dozens of community meetings in 2016 that they were \u201cwith Donald\u201d and that they believed he sincerely cared about trade. Mr. Trump last week expressed hope that the strike would be a \u201cquick one,\u201d complaining about General Motors\u2019 decision to close domestic plants and open factories offshore, and taking a swipe at the company\u2019s leadership, which announced last November that the company would close four plants in the United States. \u201cI got tremendous numbers of votes from the autoworkers,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House. \u201cI don\u2019t want General Motors to be building plants outside of this country. You know they built many plants in China and Mexico and I don\u2019t like that at all.\u201d While Mr. Trump ran as a friend of workers, some labor leaders have said that was largely empty rhetoric. In a recent interview on Fox News, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., Richard Trumka, said workers were suffering, and criticized the White House\u2019s inaction on the minimum wage. During the 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump had said he supported hiking the federal minimum wage, currently at $7.25 an hour, to $10. \u201cHe\u2019s opposed every increase in the minimum wage,\u201d Mr. Trumka said. \u201cHe\u2019s changed the regulation to take overtime away from a couple of million people. He\u2019s proposed trillion-dollar cuts to Medicare and Medicaid. He\u2019s rolled back health and safety standards toward workers.\u201d As a crowd of about 200 waited for Ms. Warren\u2019s arrival on a sunny day, blocking the entrance to the idled plant, some sang along to a recording of Aretha Franklin\u2019s \u201cRespect,\u201d the message directed at G.M. management. Many wore red T-shirts that said \u201cSolidarity, No More Bull.\u201d In many ways, Ms. Warren\u2019s central message, which emphasizes the struggles of middle- and low-income Americans, appeals to the same frustrations that Mr. Trump tapped into in 2016 \u2014 pent-up anger at an economy and system that workers view as unfair. \u201cPersonally for me, this is a lot bigger than G.M. and the autoworkers,\u201d said Mike Mucci, a worker who was on the picket line outside the Detroit plant on Sunday. \u201cThis is a fight for the middle class.\u201d Mr. Mucci, 43, who said he was not a fan of Mr. Trump, predicted that the president would \u201cdo anything he could to try to take credit for saving the U.A.W.\u201d Robert Hatline, 61, a retired G.M. worker who voted for Mrs. Clinton in 2016, said he was impressed with Ms. Warren\u2019s plan to provide free public college. \u201cI like what she says if she can do it,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to see student loans reduced off these kids.\u201d Carla Duckett, 60, a team leader on the Cadillac line here, said she would support whichever Democrat the U.A.W. endorsed. \u201cI just know we\u2019ve got to support the Democrats this time,\u201d she said. Ms. Klobuchar, who delivered doughnuts when she visited the picket line on Thursday, described how G.M. workers had suffered during the economic downturn and how the company had \u201cbounced back.\u201d \u201cThis particular company has been making a lot of money and that means to me that you got to share it with your workers,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that means better wages, that means health care, and that also means the long-term benefits that our workers deserve. That\u2019s what this is about. It\u2019s about shared prosperity, that we\u2019re all in it together.\u201d Mr. Sanders\u2019s Wednesday visit will follow a stop on Tuesday at a labor rally in support of the Chicago Teachers Union. In August, Mr. Sanders released his Workplace Democracy Plan, which he has said would double union membership during his term and give workers increased workplace protection. Mr. Ryan, who cited the closing of the Chevrolet Cruz plant in Lordstown earlier this year as the impetus for his presidential campaign, joined G.M. workers outside the idled plant last Monday. \u201cWhen a group of workers lose their jobs, it causes massive disruption in the whole community,\u201d Mr. Ryan tweeted. \u201cKids of these workers have to deal w/ either move to a new state & school; or the trauma of a parent being laid off. Educators are often left to help pick up the pieces.\u201d G.M. last year announced its plans to close the four plants, including the one in Lordstown, with hundreds of workers electing to relocate to other G.M. facilities. The Hamtramck plant, which makes the Chevrolet Impala and the Cadillac CT6, is slated to shut down in January. The idled plants have become an issue in the negotiations, with workers also pushing G.M. to improve wages, add jobs at other facilities, pay a greater share of employee health care costs, and close or narrow the difference between pay rates for new hires and veteran workers. Pointing to a $50 billion federal bailout of G.M. in 2009 following the financial crisis, as well as union concessions, many G.M. workers have said they view the decisions as particularly callous. The company paid the government back most of the money. The Democratic presidential candidates have joined picket lines in previous strikes, including the McDonald\u2019s strike in May and the Stop & Shop strike in April, as they jockey for union endorsements. But with a couple of isolated exceptions \u2014 the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America endorsed Mr. Sanders last month, and the national firefighters\u2019 union endorsed former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. in April \u2014 unions have been holding back, many waiting until they see which Democratic candidate wins the support of the rank and file.",

      "author": "Sydney Ember",
      "content": " BURLINGTON, Vt. \u2014 In July 1987, Bernie Sanders, then the mayor of Burlington, Vt., arrived in Ottawa convinced he was about to see the future of health care. Years earlier, as his mother\u2019s health declined and his family struggled to pay for medical treatment, he was spending more time attending to her than in classes at Brooklyn College, suffering through what his brother called \u201ca wrecked year\u2019\u2019 leading to her death. Over time, he had come to believe that the American health care system was flawed and inherently unfair. In Canada, he wanted to observe firsthand the government-backed, universal model that he strongly suspected was better. Amid tours of community centers and meetings with health care providers, Mr. Sanders more than liked what he saw. \u201cHe was thrilled,\u201d recalled Beth Mintz, a professor of sociology at the University of Vermont and a member of a task force that accompanied Mr. Sanders. \u201cIt gave him much more confidence in the possibility of the single-payer system as a solution.\u201d Decades before \u201cMedicare for all\u201d would propel his presidential campaigns, Mr. Sanders\u2019s expedition to Ottawa helped forge his determination to transform the American health care system. His views burst onto the national political scene during his 2016 presidential run, when he championed a single-payer program alongside many other liberal policy ideas. Now, as he seeks the Democratic presidential nomination for a second time, he has made \u201cMedicare for all\u201d the most important issue of his campaign and set the agenda for the ideological discussion in the primary. Health care dominated the first two Democratic debates this summer and will most likely be  prominent again during the third debate on Thursday in Houston. Other candidates support \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d but it is Mr. Sanders who has become singularly identified with it \u2014 \u201cI wrote the damn bill!\u2019\u2019 he proclaimed in July\u2019s debate. A review of hundreds of pages of documents from the first chapters of his political career \u2014 including speeches, correspondences and newspaper clippings \u2014 as well as interviews with those who have known him throughout his life, show that while his democratic socialist worldview underpins his \u201cMedicare for all\u201d pitch, he was also guided by other factors. Chief among them were his mother\u2019s illness and death, which instilled in him the desire  to ensure everyone had access to medical care, and the adjacency of Vermont to Canada, which afforded him a blueprint for universal health care. Together, they help explain why he has staked not only his campaign, but also much of his political legacy, on promoting \u201cMedicare for all.\u2019\u2019 \u201cYou can\u2019t overstate the impact that Vermont\u2019s proximity to Canada had on Bernie\u2019s thinking about how to approach reforming the American health care system,\u201d said Jeff Weaver, who has worked with Mr. Sanders since the 1980s and remains one of his closest advisers. The pull of Canada remains strong: In July, Mr. Sanders took a bus trip from Detroit to Windsor, Ontario, with diabetes patients to highlight lower drug prices in Canada. In an interview on Sunday, Mr. Sanders described how seeing the Canadian system up close significantly shaped his own views on health care. \u201cIt was kind of mind blowing to realize that the country 50 miles away from where I live \u2014 that people could go to the doctor whenever they wanted and not have to take out their wallet,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was just a profound lesson that I learned,\u201d he said. He also criticized the American system as \u201cbarbaric.\u201d And he vowed \u2014 as he often does in his stump speeches \u2014 \u201cto take on the greed and the corruption of the health care industry.\u201d  Mr. Sanders\u2019s health care proposal has attracted legions of supporters fed up with the rising costs of the current system, and it sets him apart from more centrist candidates like Joseph R. Biden Jr. But his uncompromising position also threatens to alienate voters who are pleased with the Affordable Care Act, or who do not want to give up their private insurance. His own state of Vermont so far does not have a single-payer program. Despite skepticism about his views, however, Mr. Sanders has consistently resolved to reform the health care system, even before being elected to public office. In 1972, when he was running for Senate as a candidate from Vermont\u2019s left-wing Liberty Union Party, The Bennington Banner, a local newspaper, reported him taking an uncompromising stance: \u201cThere is absolutely no rational reason, in the United States of America today, we could not have full and total free medical care for all.\u201d The first seeds of Mr. Sanders\u2019s concern were sown in Brooklyn. A high-school track and cross country star with an emerging political streak, Mr. Sanders had wanted to go to Harvard, friends said. But by his senior year, his mother, Dorothy Sanders, had become sick, her heart damaged from having rheumatic fever as a child. As her health declined, her illness consumed him. He stopped going to track practice. To be closer to her, he began his freshman year at Brooklyn College. Mr. Sanders describes his family as lower middle class. His father, an immigrant from Poland, was a paint salesman. He has said his parents frequently argued about money. When his mother fell ill, his family moved her into a charity hospital in New Jersey. After a failed heart surgery, she died in March 1960, when she was in her mid-40s. \u201cBernard actually spent much more time with her than he did in class,\u2019\u2019 his brother, Larry, recalled in an interview in February. \u201cIt was really a kind of wrecked year and a very unhappy year.\u201d Then, as now, Mr. Sanders avoided speaking of his mother\u2019s death. On Sunday, he declined to discuss his personal life, but said that his family had \u201cstruggled economically, and that\u2019s it.\u201d In a 2006 interview with Vermont PBS, he offered a glimpse into how her illness shaped his thinking. \u201cWhen you talk about money and family, how do you get the money for the medical treatment that my mother needed?\u201d he said. \u201cI won\u2019t go into the whole long song and dance of it. But trust me, it was something that I also have not forgotten about \u2014 the right of people to have health care, which was a little bit difficult in our family situation.\u201d  It would still be some years, though, before health care became his political hallmark. Mr. Sanders transferred to the University of Chicago, where he spent hours in the library reading progressive publications that would influence his political views. There, he turned his energy toward civil rights. \u201cWe didn\u2019t talk about health care,\u201d said one of his roommates, Ivan Light. \u201cIt was not on the political agenda at that time. Civil rights was on the agenda.\u201d After moving to Vermont, he became active in politics. A perennial candidate with the Liberty Union Party in the 1970s, he focused on issues like the tax structure. But he also began to study health care seriously. Included in a collection of papers from those days are pamphlets, articles and other material related to medical care. One publication he saved from March 1972 was titled, \u201cHealth Rights News;\u201d its slogan was \u201cHealth care is a human right.\u201d That research soon began to take hold: In October 1976, when he was the Liberty Union candidate for governor, he told The Burlington Free Press that the delivery of medical care was \u201cbasically a national problem\u201d and that he supported \u201cpublic ownership of the drug companies and placing doctors on salaries.\u201d \u201cI believe in socialized medicine,\u201d he said. John Bloch, who has known Mr. Sanders since the 1970s when they were active in Vermont politics, said he thought Mr. Sanders\u2019s views were influenced in part by the people he lived near in the rural town of Stannard, Vt., many of whom were in desperate need of health care. \u201cHe didn\u2019t just come to this as Johnny-come-lately,\u201d Mr. Bloch said. In the interview Sunday, Mr. Sanders said he was particularly affected at the time by a young boy who lived across the road whose teeth, he said, were rotting in his mouth. Deb Richter, a Vermont physician and longtime advocate for single-payer health care, who has worked with Mr. Sanders on the issue for 20 years, said he had always felt that health care was a human right. \u201cYou ask Vermonters, \u2018How long has Bernie been talking about single-payer health care for all?\u2019 and nobody can remember a time he wasn\u2019t talking about it,\u2019\u2019 she said. After Mr. Sanders was elected mayor of Burlington in 1981, he largely emphasized local issues, like property taxes and affordable housing. \u201cI was the mayor of a city of 40,000 people,\u201d Mr. Sanders said in the interview. \u201cTalking about national health care is not exactly what you talk to the board of aldermen about.\u201d By then, he had also become somewhat fixated on Canada. In September 1981, he invited the director of the Quebec Insurance Board to speak about  the province\u2019s health insurance plan. Later, he demanded more accountability from the state\u2019s health insurance company and encouraged a review of hospital budgets.  As he pondered higher office, his focus on health care intensified. Even before he announced his 1986 campaign for governor, he said he planned to run in part on controlling medical costs, according to an article in the Vermont newspaper The Times Argus. He lost that race but gathered valuable information in the process: During his campaign, his team had polled Vermont residents on issues. \u201cTo my surprise,\u201d Mr. Sanders said in 1987, \u201cthe issue that Vermonters felt most strongly about was the rapidly rising costs of health care.\u201d That finding served to galvanize his actions on health care. He quickly set up a task force and charged it with studying how to make the system more affordable. Soon Mr. Sanders and the task force \u2014 which included an expert on the Cuban health care system, professors and a minister \u2014 were traveling to Ottawa, which had  implemented a government-supported, single-payer system. Jed Lowy, who went on the trip, recalled touring a public hospital, visiting a neighborhood community health center and speaking with physicians. \u201cIt was interesting to see another way that health care was provided,\u201d Mr. Lowy said. That trip, and a later one to Montreal, reinforced Mr. Sanders\u2019s idea that Vermont\u2019s northern neighbor had effectively put into practice the kind of accessible, affordable system he had long sought. At a news conference after the Ottawa visit, the task force suggested Burlington could model its health care system after Canada\u2019s. And in unequivocal tones, Mr. Sanders said it would be \u201cabsolutely negligent\u201d not to examine at least some aspects of the Canadian model. In March 1988, the task force released a report recommending the creation of a national health care system. Mr. Sanders\u2019s focus on health care policy met some resistance at home from city employees reluctant to give up benefits they had earned. Mr. Sanders forcefully rebutted the criticism. \u201cYou may regard this as \u2018propaganda\u2019,\u201d he wrote tersely in response to a letter from an angry constituent in December 1982. \u201cI expect that you may not have talked to citizens who are taking their food money to pay for medical care.\u201d By the time Mr. Sanders was mounting his 1988 congressional run, he was speaking about health care in the kind of dogmatic terms he uses today, and he was broadening his vision beyond Vermont. He praised the National League of Cities for adopting a resolution to establish a national health system. Soon after formally announcing his congressional campaign, he set forth his premier agenda item, one that he had imagined since his mother\u2019s death some three decades earlier. \u201cI want to make it emphatically clear,\u201d he said in April 1988, \u201cthat I will make health care reform a top priority as a United States congressman from the state of Vermont.\u201d",

      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 Oddly, it has been business as usual on the campaign trail this week. Senator Elizabeth Warren explained her policy plans to voters in New Hampshire on Wednesday, Senator Bernie Sanders walked a picket line with striking auto workers in Detroit and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. courted donors in Bel Air, Calif., and went on Jimmy Kimmel\u2019s late-night TV show. But behind the scenes, many of the 2020 Democratic candidates have been grappling with a new reality: For the first time, a presidential primary will unfold with a sitting president seeking re-election while also facing an impeachment inquiry. There is no political playbook for this. No pollster or strategist to speak from experience. What is clear, from interviews with advisers and allies with the various campaigns, is that the top candidates like Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren believe they are sufficiently established in the race that they can continue to command attention for their candidacies and messages. Second-tier and third-tier candidates, however, are at much greater risk of falling off the radar screen for an electorate that may soon be at a standstill, distracted by an impeachment circus in Washington. \u201cThis is a nuclear bomb dropped in the middle of the race and it\u2019s going to change the dynamics for everyone,\u201d said Jared Leopold, an aide to Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington, who dropped out of the race several weeks ago. \u201cYou can\u2019t go on pretending it was like it was a week ago.\u201d \u201cIt scrambles the playing field,\u201d he added. The political intensity surrounding impeachment was on vivid display at a private Biden fund-raiser on Thursday afternoon in California, where Mr. Biden said that Mr. Trump had tried to \u201chijack the election\u201d by asking the president of Ukraine to help undertake a corruption investigation against the former vice president and his son, Hunter Biden. \u201cHe\u2019d like to get foreign help to win elections,\u201d Mr. Biden said. The stark new reality for the Democratic haves and have-nots is rooted in the bifurcated political landscape of the 2020 campaign. For months, it has played out on cable television, where some candidates have been able to convert appearances into polling bumps and greater fund-raising. It has also played out on the campaign trail, where candidates have tried to catch fire with voters by talking about rising prescription drug bills, child care costs and student debt burdens. For weeks ahead, if not months, cable shows will be so crowded with news and analysis of impeachment that only the top Democrats may have a guaranteed shot at getting on the airwaves. And in places like Iowa and New Hampshire, it may become harder for lower-polling candidates to get attention and break through there, too, amid the ongoing focus on Washington. \u201cThese hearings are going to be taking place while the primary contests are unfolding,\u201d Matt Barreto, a co-founder of the polling firm Latino Decisions, said. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be wall-to-wall coverage of impeachment, how do they find space to talk about Medicare for all, immigration reform or criminal justice reform?\u201d On Wednesday, as new revelations about Mr. Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine unfolded on cable news, strategists, aides and allies on lower-polling campaigns cracked dark jokes about their futures, privately worrying that an expected nonstop news media focus on impeachment could be fatal for their campaigns. More than a dozen candidates have staked their presidential bids on a breakout moment that has not yet happened, one they argue could come if Mr. Biden falters. With Mr. Biden and his son at the center of the impeachment drama, Ms. Warren ascendant and the nation\u2019s attention focused on what happens with Mr. Trump, the path for everyone else vying for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination just got a lot harder. The new normal may be campaign stunts like the almost-all-access bus tour Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., took reporters on this week in Iowa, dubbed the \u201cLive Tweet Express\u201d by Politico for the real-time chronicling reporters did of its exploits. Making matters worse for candidates who have seen their fund-raising pace slow dramatically since the end of June, the House\u2019s turn toward impeachment comes in the last week of the quarter, just days before a Sept. 30 deadline that, for several candidates, will serve as the latest marker of their financial viability. In the last 48 hours, there have been signs that candidates other than Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren are beginning to recalibrate their strategies to keep their campaigns relevant. Mr. Sanders, who for decades has refused to allow current events to alter his campaign strategy, held a rare news conference Tuesday in Davenport, Iowa, hours before the formal impeachment inquiry was announced. He provided a revealing glimpse into the two sides of impeachment for the candidates, castigating Mr. Trump for committing what he believed were \u201cimpeachable offenses\u201d while also pulling back and acknowledging that impeachment proceedings posed political risks for both sides. \u201cThis is a complicated issue from a political point of view,\u201d he said. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, who on Saturday launched a fund-raising drive that his campaign manager said was critical to his staying in the race, appeared Tuesday night on the same MSNBC program with Senator Kamala Harris of California \u2014 a demotion for two candidates who typically headline their own shows. The next morning Mr. Booker appeared on \u201cFox and Friends\u201d for the first time as a presidential candidate, talking about impeachment on the president\u2019s favorite morning news show \u2014 an apparent attempt to draw himself into Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter-based news cycles. Overwhelming numbers of Democrats nationwide support impeachment, with nearly three-quarters backing the House moving forward, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday morning. Yet, the topic has not gained primary candidates much traction on the campaign trail. In part, that is because impeachment is not a distinguishing issue; all the leading candidates support moving forward with an impeachment investigation. \u201cThere\u2019s an underlying stipulation that Trump should be impeached and the Democratic candidates all agree on that point,\u201d said Geoff Garin, a pollster working for Priorities USA, a Democratic super PAC. \u201cSo questions about that don\u2019t help voters sort out one candidate from the other.\u201d Democratic officials and strategists say primary voters are more eager to hear about the issues that directly impact their lives, like health care, immigration and the economy. \u201cWhen we knock on doors the thing we hear about most is health care costs,\u201d Ben Wikler, chairman of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin, said. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense that Washington and the Trump administration are spinning out of control but what\u2019s agonizing about that to voters is they have actual problems in their lives.\u201d The only exception may be Mr. Biden, who finds his family at the center of Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks, which continued in a Wednesday news conference carried by all the major broadcast and cable networks \u2014 though MSNBC cut away early. Some of Mr. Biden\u2019s advisers and allies are aware that Mr. Trump\u2019s focus on Mr. Biden\u2019s son Hunter and his business dealings in Ukraine carries potential risk for him. Yet they also believe that Mr. Biden is at his strongest when he is challenging Mr. Trump over American values and the direction of the nation, rather than relitigating his past, and his verbal gaffes, with his Democratic rivals. The new impeachment focus offers the former vice president an opportunity to draw direct contrasts with Mr. Trump at a time when many Democrats are inclined to be protective of Mr. Biden, aides and allies say. They also argue that Mr. Trump\u2019s focus on Mr. Biden suggests the president is worried about Mr. Biden\u2019s candidacy, a message the Biden campaign has reinforced through fund-raising appeals. \u201cIt reminds him of when he was young and had a stuttering problem and dealt with bullies then,\u201d said Representative Cedric Richmond, a Louisiana Democrat who is a national co-chairman of Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign. \u201cAnd he\u2019s dealing with bullies now.\u201d But it may be Ms. Warren who most benefits from the timing of the impeachment inquiry. It comes just as she was beginning to receive increased scrutiny from her rivals and the press over her opaque answers on health care policy. Impeachment swings the news pendulum back to one of Ms. Warren\u2019s strengths \u2014 in April she was the first top-tier candidate to call for impeaching Mr. Trump, a move that helped infuse her then-listing campaign with momentum that has yet to slow down. Impeachment may also serve to shield Ms. Warren from fresh attacks from her Democratic rivals seeking to take aim at someone who has overtaken Mr. Biden atop some early-state polling. With the news media focused on impeachment, attacking Ms. Warren over an issue like health care may be like shouting into a void, aides to rival candidates said. \u201cImpeachment is good news for Elizabeth Warren,\u201d Jeff Link, a longtime Democratic strategist, said. \u201cIf everything gets frozen, she\u2019s either at the top or near the top.\u201d The impeachment drama does not appear likely to force any dramatic recalibration of Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign. Unlike most of her rivals, she is not starving for attention. \u201cIt is time for impeachment now,\u201d Ms. Warren told a crowd Wednesday night in Keene, N.H. \u201cI\u2019m glad to see that the House has stepped up, and I hope we do this, and I hope we do it quickly.\u201d She then went back to her stump speech.",

      "author": "Sydney Ember",
      "content": " LAS VEGAS \u2014 Senator Bernie Sanders introduced a $2.5 trillion housing policy plan on Saturday that would include ending homelessness and limiting rent increases across the country by imposing a national rent control standard. Mr. Sanders said that over the next decade, his plan would expand public housing, increase the availability of affordable housing and cap annual rent increases nationally, regardless of income, at no more than one and a half times the rate of inflation or 3 percent, whichever is higher. His campaign said he would be releasing his full plan within the next month. \u201cWe have an affordable housing crisis in Nevada, in Vermont and all over this country that must be addressed,\u201d he told an audience of about 100 people at a union hall in Las Vegas, which was hit hard by the housing crisis a decade ago. \u201cFor too long, this is one of those issues that we just don\u2019t talk about.\u201d This is the second time in the past 15 days that Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign has teased a policy rollout without releasing an actual proposal. Late last month, the Vermont senator said at a health care-focused event in Florence, S.C., that he planned to introduce legislation that would eliminate all medical debt. His campaign followed his pronouncement with a one-page overview of what the plan would entail, including canceling $81 billion of existing medical debt. The campaign also said at the time that a plan would be released within a month. [Sign up for our politics newsletter hosted by Lisa Lerer and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race.] The series of soft rollouts underscore just how policy focused the Democratic presidential primary has become. Led by Senator Elizabeth Warren, the field has been introducing policy plans at a pace that at times has been frenetic. Mr. Sanders has long advocated for affordable housing, even during his days as mayor of Burlington, Vt., in the 1980s. But though he suggested housing was not a front-burner topic for many politicians, other 2020 candidates have also introduced housing policies. Ms. Warren and Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former housing secretary under President Barack Obama, have already released their own housing proposals. Senator Kamala Harris has also introduced a bill that would allow overburdened renters to access a sliding tax credit based on factors like income and cost of rent. Mr. Sanders said he would pay for the plan by instituting a wealth tax on the top one-tenth of 1 percent of American households, or about 175,000 households, but provided little else in the way of specific details. During his address, part of a weekend swing through Nevada that also featured a rally at the University of Nevada, Reno, on Friday, Mr. Sanders also attacked President Trump and attempted to draw a contrast between his childhood and the president\u2019s more privileged upbringing. \u201cUnlike Donald Trump, I did not grow up in a wealthy family or live in some fancy house,\u201d he said, a thought he has expressed before. In a rare occurrence, Mr. Sanders also mentioned his mother during his address, saying she had always wanted to move out of the three-and-a-half room rent-controlled apartment in Brooklyn, where they lived when he was a boy. \u201cMy mother\u2019s dream was that someday we would move out of that rent-controlled apartment in Brooklyn and we would own a home of our own,\u201d he said. \u201cMy mother died young, and her dream was never fulfilled. But during her life, at least our family was always able to afford a roof over our heads, because we were living in a rent-controlled building, which meant that for our family and all the other families in our building, rents could not be arbitrarily raised.\u201d [Which Democrats are leading the 2020 presidential race this week?] As with many of his proposals, Mr. Sanders acknowledged that the cost of his housing plan would be steep. \u201cI have no doubt that within five minutes after this speech is made public, my critics will be jumping up and down as is usually the case and they will tell you that the plan that I am releasing is expensive,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the truth is it is expensive.\u201d Mr. Sanders also promised to commit $32 billion over five years to end homelessness, and provide outreach services for people experiencing chronic homelessness. He did not say how he would end it; his campaign said more details would be in his full proposal.",

      "content": "  Senator Bernie Sanders has overhauled his New Hampshire state operations five months before the primary, as his campaign fights to maintain support in a state he won by more than 22 percentage points in 2016. In a series of moves, the campaign has replaced the New Hampshire state director, Joe Caiazzo, with Shannon Jackson, who is a member of Mr. Sanders\u2019s inner circle and who led the senator\u2019s re-election campaign in Vermont last year. Mr. Caiazzo, who was Mr. Sanders\u2019s political director in Massachusetts and Rhode Island during the 2016 campaign, has been named state director in Massachusetts. The moves were announced to the campaign\u2019s New Hampshire staff on Sunday. \u201cWe feel really good about where we stand in New Hampshire right now,\u201d said Faiz Shakir, the Sanders campaign manager. \u201cThe poll numbers, the volunteer capacity, the crowds that we have been getting at these events all suggest to us that we are in a very good position.\u201d He added: \u201cObviously, much work to do to continue that trend.\u201d The Sanders campaign also recently shook up its top leadership, promoting both Ari Rabin-Havt, the chief of staff, and Arianna Jones, the communications director, to the position of deputy campaign manager and bringing on a new senior communications adviser. [Here are six takeaways from the September Democratic debate.] Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign said the moves in New Hampshire and elsewhere are an attempt to expand his operations and organize supporters in the northeast as they look beyond the early states toward Super Tuesday, when several other New England states, including Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s state of Massachusetts, will vote. The campaign recently hired a Maine state director, Ben Collings, a member of the Maine Legislature who ran Maine for Mr. Sanders\u2019s 2016 campaign. \u201cThis campaign is building up and spreading out over the next few months,\u201d Mr. Shakir said. But Mr. Sanders\u2019s decision to shake up his campaign in first-in-the-nation New Hampshire, a state he almost certainly must win to have a chance at the nomination, underscores the challenges he faces in recreating the formula from his landslide victory there against Hillary Clinton. Without the same mix of New Hampshire\u2019s anti-establishment and progressive voters all to himself this time, he has fallen into the 20s in most polls, bunched up with Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Ms. Warren at the top of the surveys in the state. The rise of Ms. Warren, in particular, has created difficulties for Mr. Sanders because, like him, she is from a neighboring state and, also like him, appeals to much of the party\u2019s left. Potentially even more threatening, she represents a new alternative for the voters who were mostly aligned with Mr. Sanders in 2016 to oppose Mrs. Clinton. What gets less attention, but which some New Hampshire Democrats say helps explain Mr. Sanders\u2019s challenges there, are the long-shot candidates: Andrew Yang, a former tech entrepreneur, Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii and Marianne Williamson, a best-selling self-help author, are drawing attention from the sort of avant-garde voters who had no such alternative options last cycle other than the Vermont senator. New Hampshire Democrats said Mr. Caiazzo, who grew up in Massachusetts and last year ran the re-election campaign of Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, was a traditional party operative and always something of an unusual fit for Mr. Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist whose campaign is about upending the establishment. And increasingly, Mr. Sanders, in New Hampshire and across the country, is focused less on winning over traditional Democratic activists than he is in mobilizing volunteers as well as new supporters, particularly individuals who have not participated in past primaries, including independents and disaffected Republicans. New Hampshire Democrats also believe that Mr. Sanders did not have the sort of organization befitting the candidate who had won the state so overwhelmingly three years ago. Mr. Jackson, who was previously the Sanders campaign\u2019s northeast regional director, has worked with Mr. Sanders for years, including in his senate office in Burlington, Vt. He also helped start Our Revolution, the senator\u2019s political advocacy group. In a statement, Mr. Jackson said he was \u201chonored to be taking on a more direct role in this critically important state\u201d and praised the team there. The campaign said it had recently added a campus outreach director and labor outreach director in New Hampshire as well. Glenn Thrush contributed reporting.",

      "author": "Alan Rappeport",
      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 Progressive Democrats are advocating the most drastic shift in tax policy in over a century as they look to redistribute wealth and chip away at the economic power of the superrich with new taxes that could fundamentally reshape the United States economy. As they compete for the Democratic presidential nomination, Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont have proposed wealth taxes that would shrink the fortunes of the richest Americans. Their plans envision an enormous transfer of money from the wealthy to ordinary people, with revenue from the wealth tax used to finance new social programs like tuition-free college, universal child care and \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d The wealth taxes under discussion would deal a major blow to the balance sheets of American plutocrats like Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates and Warren Buffett. If the tax that Ms. Warren has called for had been in place since 1982, the net worth of the 15 richest Americans in 2018 would have been half as much, according to two economists who helped develop her plan. The Sanders wealth tax, which was released last week, would have eroded their fortunes even further, to barely one-fifth of their 2018 total. The idea of a wealth tax has become an animating issue for the Democratic Party, which sees it as a solution to long-festering concerns about inequality and the rapid concentration of economic power among wealthy Americans. Its emergence is also an antidote to the policies of President Trump, whose $1.5 trillion tax cut largely benefited rich Americans and corporations while leaving future generations with the bill. \u201cWe are living in the second Gilded Age,\u201d said Bruce Ackerman, a professor of law and political science at Yale University, referring to the stark wealth gap produced by the Industrial Revolution. \u201cWhat we have once again is people both on the right and the left being provoked by the perception they are being left behind.\u201d [Bernie Sanders raised $25.3 million in the most recent fund-raising quarter, reflecting his continued strength with small-dollar donors.] But the idea of redistributing wealth by targeting billionaires is stirring fierce debates at the highest ranks of academia and business, with opponents arguing it would cripple economic growth, sap the motivation of entrepreneurs who aspire to be multimillionaires and set off a search for loopholes. \u201cYou\u2019re going to completely disincentivize capital investment, which is going to be very, very bad for economic growth,\u201d Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in an interview  in September. \u201cTaxing capital is not a good thing for creating economic growth, and if anything we should be looking at how we create more incentives for economic growth.\u201d Income inequality has surged in the United States in the last 50 years, with the top 0.1 percent now controlling about a fifth of the nation\u2019s wealth. That concentration of wealth has coincided with stagnant wages, rising college costs and the lingering effects of the Great Recession, which erased trillions of dollars in household wealth, ravaging the middle class. New figures from the Census Bureau released last week show that income inequality in the United States reached its highest level last year since the government began tracking it in 1967. The dueling policy proposals from Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders come as they compete intensely for support from the same universe of liberal voters and activists. Their tax proposals are helping to galvanize those on the left, but their ideas will also provide fodder for Republicans eager to paint them in a general election as tax-happy and too liberal. Polls have found widespread support for the idea of taxing wealth. A poll conducted for The New York Times by the internet research firm SurveyMonkey this summer found that two-thirds of Americans, including a majority of Republicans, backed a 2 percent tax on households worth over $50 million, which is the heart of Ms. Warren\u2019s plan. The proposals for a wealth tax are among a variety of ideas for collecting more tax revenue that Democratic presidential candidates have put forward. On Monday, Mr. Sanders proposed a new tax on corporations that have a huge gap between what they pay their chief executive and their median worker. Jared Bernstein, who was chief economist for Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. from 2009 to 2011, said he has discussed with the Biden campaign a proposal to tax financial transactions. [The latest data and analysis to keep track of who\u2019s leading the race to be the Democratic nominee.] On the campaign trail, Ms. Warren explains the concept of a wealth tax by putting it in familiar terms, likening it to the property taxes that many Americans pay on their homes. For the superrich, she said in South Carolina on Saturday, \u201chow about we include in yours not only your real estate, but also your stock portfolio, the diamonds, the Rembrandt and the yacht?\u201d Mr. Sanders is blunt about his desire to reduce the size of America\u2019s biggest fortunes, even highlighting how much individual billionaires would have to pay in taxes under his proposal. He said last week that he did not believe billionaires should exist in the United States. \u201cThere\u2019s no question to my mind that the United States is moving toward an oligarchy,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cThis is an issue that has to be addressed, and this wealth tax begins to do that.\u201d  The United States largely taxes individuals based on the income they earn through their jobs and investments. Wealth taxes impose annual levies on an individual\u2019s accumulated assets, everything from vacation homes and art collections to stakes in companies and family heirlooms. The tax proposed by Ms. Warren would apply to households worth over $50 million. She would impose a 2 percent tax on net worth above $50 million, and a 3 percent tax on net worth above $1 billion. The plan from Mr. Sanders would apply to a larger number of households, and it would be particularly aggressive on billionaires. His tax would start out at 1 percent on net worth from $32 million to $50 million for married couples, and it would top out at 8 percent on net worth over $10 billion. Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, the two University of California, Berkeley, economists who helped Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders develop their plans, project that Ms. Warren\u2019s proposal would hit about 70,000 households and generate $2.6 trillion in revenue for the federal government over a decade. They project that Mr. Sanders\u2019s proposal would apply to 180,000 households and raise $4.35 trillion over 10 years. Mr. Zucman said in an interview that he believes a wealth tax would have a modest but positive impact on growth. By reducing the power of the wealthiest, he argued, it would make markets more competitive and spur innovation. [Who\u2019s in? Who\u2019s out? Keep up with the 2020 field with our candidate tracker.] But redirecting such vast sums could have unintended effects on the United States economy that go beyond promulgating economic fairness. While Ms. Warren ticks off the social programs that can be funded if the richest Americans pay just 2 cents on every dollar they have above $50 million \u2014 a number that is unimaginable to most Americans \u2014 skeptics warn of economic stagnation, depressed business confidence and a legal battle that would go to the Supreme Court. At a conference sponsored by the Brookings Institution in September, N. Gregory Mankiw, a Harvard economist, debated Mr. Saez and Mr. Zucman about the merits of taxing wealth. Mr. Mankiw, the former head of President George W. Bush\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, offered a searing critique, arguing that a wealth tax would skew incentives that could alter when the superrich make investments, how they give to charity and even potentially spur a wave of divorces for tax purposes. He also noted that billionaires, with their legions of lawyers and accountants, have proven to be experts at gaming the system to avoid even the most onerous taxes. \u201cOn the one hand it\u2019s a bad policy, and then the other thing is it\u2019s a feckless policy,\u201d Mr. Mankiw said. Left-leaning economists have expressed their own doubts about a wealth tax. Earlier this year, Lawrence Summers, who was President Bill Clinton\u2019s Treasury secretary, warned in an article with Natasha Sarin, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania, that wealth taxes would sap innovation by putting new burdens on entrepreneurial businesses while they are starting up. In their view, a country with more millionaires is a sign of economic vibrancy. \u201cTurning the tax code into a vehicle for confronting what some call \u2018oligarchic drift\u2019 would undermine business confidence, reduce investment, degrade economic efficiency and punish success in ways unlikely to be good for the country or even to be appealing to most Americans,\u201d they wrote. Corporate America has also come out against a wealth tax. At a recent briefing by the Business Roundtable, a lobbying group for large companies, Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, said he feared that the federal government would squander the additional revenue. \u201cI know a lot of wealthy people who would be happy to pay more in taxes; they just think it\u2019ll be wasted and be given to interest groups and stuff like that,\u201d Mr. Dimon said. Other obstacles that often raise concern about wealth taxes are how to value assets like art and private businesses when determining wealth, and the potential impact on stock markets if rich shareholders suddenly have to liquidate their holdings to pay their tax bills. Despite the many obstacles, a wealth tax in the United States could prove to be a political winner for Democrats and serve as a rejoinder to Mr. Trump, who has allowed deficits to swell by cutting taxes without curbing spending. Ms. Warren makes a point of stressing she is not looking to punish the rich, and she presents the tax as quite modest: just 2 cents on every dollar over $50 million in net worth. That 2-cent tax \u2014 which rises to 3 cents on net worth over $1 billion \u2014 amounts to a golden key that unlocks other policy plans, covering the cost of proposals like student debt cancellation, free public college and universal child care. Ms. Warren\u2019s White House bid is the rare political campaign where a tax rate has become a catchy slogan: Crowds have broken out into chants of \u201c2 cents!\u201d and at a recent political event in Iowa, two of her campaign staffers dressed up as pennies. \u201cI think that what she does really brilliantly is takes a policy that\u2019s really cumbersome and makes it really simple and straightforward,\u201d Victoria Farris, 38, said after Ms. Warren gave a speech in New York in September. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be an economist, you don\u2019t have to have an advanced degree \u2014 2 cents is 2 cents.\u201d",

      "content": "  CHARLESTON, S.C. \u2014 Clutching a cup of tea to soothe his hoarsening voice, Senator Bernie Sanders took the stage at the College of Charleston this week with a familiar message for anyone who had been following him since 2015, inveighing against the economic system (\u201cgrossly unfair\u201d), political system (\u201ccorrupt\u201d) and health care system (\u201cinsanity\u201d). But Mr. Sanders said something needed to be different in 2020 if his promised revolution was going to come to fruition. \u201cI\u2019m here to ask for your help, to help me win the Democratic primary here in South Carolina,\u201d he said. \u201cWith your help, we can do that. We do that, we\u2019re going to win the nomination.\u201d Many Democrats in the presidential race are banking on strong showings in Iowa and New Hampshire, the first nominating contests, to slingshot them into South Carolina with political momentum and then on to Super Tuesday. But Mr. Sanders knows that will not be enough \u2014 or at least it was not enough for him in 2016. That year, he stunned the political world by almost beating Hillary Clinton in the Iowa caucuses. He trounced her in New Hampshire. Then, in more diverse South Carolina, where black voters make up an estimated 60 percent of the Democratic primary electorate, he got annihilated anyway. He lost every county in the state, with Mrs. Clinton carrying more than half of them with more than 80 percent of the vote. Only in one did Mr. Sanders even top 40 percent. South Carolina was the signal defeat in his upstart challenge to Mrs. Clinton, the state where his inability to win support from African-Americans, a crucial Democratic constituency, was laid bare. Mrs. Clinton marched across the South with similarly huge margins, building an unmatchable delegate advantage to clinch the nomination. \u201cThe reason why he got beat here so badly last time is the African-American community didn\u2019t support him, didn\u2019t know who he was, so they went with who they knew,\u201d said Kwadjo Campbell, Mr. Sanders\u2019s South Carolina state director. As in his race against Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Sanders faces in former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. a familiar face with a reservoir of good will among many black voters \u2014 a man who served two terms as the No. 2 to the first black president, and who begins far ahead in the South Carolina polls. Only now the race also includes two major black candidates, Senators Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey, as well as another senator, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who is peeling off support on the ideological left. Faiz Shakir, Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign manager, called the South Carolina challenge \u201csignificant but not insurmountable,\u201d especially if Mr. Sanders performs well in the three preceding states, including Nevada. \u201cThere is a really great possibility for South Carolina \u2014 I won\u2019t say win \u2014 but I do think cutting margins significantly,\u201d Mr. Shakir said, \u201cparticularly in the African-American community, which I think he will do much better with. That\u2019s the path.\u201d After mostly minimizing South Carolina four years ago, if not seeming to downright disregard it at times, Mr. Sanders has returned with a previously unseen vigor. Once he had declared his candidacy in 2015, Mr. Sanders went more than three months before his first visit to South Carolina (one trip was postponed after the Charleston church shooting). This year, he has already visited seven times as a candidate; by this weekend, when Mr. Sanders visits on a college tour, he will have notched as many visits to the state as he made in the 2016 cycle. \u201cWe\u2019re going to give the vice president a run for his money,\u201d said Nina Turner, a national co-chair of the Sanders campaign, who is black and who has been instrumental in the South Carolina strategy, visiting the state herself at least twice a month. Mr. Sanders has unveiled two of his major policy proposals in South Carolina \u2014 his criminal justice plan and his \u201cThurgood Marshall Plan\u201d for public education \u2014 as part of an effort to show his commitment to black voters in the state, advisers said. He has six offices here and 52 paid staff members (nearly three-quarters are people of color, according to the campaign). A Sanders spokesman in South Carolina, Michael Wukela, said the Vermont senator now counts 24 endorsements in the state \u2014 20 of them from black supporters \u2014 compared with a total of only five at the end of the 2016 race. Members of the clergy are being wooed, as well. \u201cI know he\u2019s been working hard,\u201d the Rev. Joseph Darby, an influential pastor in Charleston who is close to Mr. Biden, said of Mr. Sanders. \u201cI give him an E for effort.\u201d An early snapshot of the state suggests that Mr. Sanders still faces an uphill climb. In a selfie line after a shrimp-and-grits breakfast event in Georgetown, S.C., last month, nearly all of the people waiting for photographs with the senator were white. And in conversations with black leaders and voters, including some at Mr. Sanders\u2019s own events, there was still uncertainty about Mr. Sanders and his policies. Several people mentioned his \u201cMedicare for All\u201d proposal for a government-run health insurance system. Mae McKnight, 74, who attended the Georgetown event, said she was still deciding which candidate would win her vote. She was leaning toward Mr. Biden to \u201cget the country back to some kind of calm normalcy,\u201d she said. Though she liked Mr. Sanders, she said, \u201cI would not want him to take my insurance plan.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t care who gets it as long as I can keep mine,\u201d Ms. McKnight added, noting she was on her teachers\u2019 union\u2019s health plan. Pamela Venson, a retiree who lives in Florence, showed up at the recent Galivants Ferry candidate stump, which Mr. Sanders ended up missing to rest his voice. Ms. Venson, a Biden supporter, called the former vice president \u201cseasoned,\u201d but saw Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren as \u201ctoo risky\u201d and \u201ctoo left.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have the money first,\u201d Ms. Venson said of their ambitious policy plans. Marvin R. Pendarvis, a state representative supporting former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas, said that many black voters viewed Mr. Sanders\u2019s expansive agenda warily. \u201cThey like the idea of all that stuff. And it would be great in a perfect world. But we don\u2019t live in a perfect world,\u201d Mr. Pendarvis said. \u201cMany black Americans are just reluctant to take the kind of risks like that. We want something a little more concrete.\u201d National polls show that African-American voters remain Mr. Biden\u2019s most reliable voting bloc, and an area of relative weakness for Mr. Sanders. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released this week found Mr. Biden with the support of 49 percent of black Democratic primary voters nationwide, while Mr. Sanders had only 5 percent support. (Among all Democratic primary voters surveyed, Mr. Biden led with 31 percent, Ms. Warren had 25 percent and Mr. Sanders had 14 percent.)  The centerpiece of Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign pitch remains economic and class matters: Medicare for All, a $15 minimum wage, eliminating student debt. References to racial justice remain the rhetorical flourishes of his stump speech. Advisers to Mr. Sanders have pressed him to speak more about his own civil rights activism as a student in the 1960s, as he did in an early campaign speech in Chicago. Mr. Sanders has mostly ignored them. \u201cCan I get him to talk about anything in his life? It\u2019s very hard,\u201d Mr. Shakir said. Alicia Garza, a founder of Black Lives Matter who was in South Carolina this week on a bus tour promoting a new women\u2019s group, Supermajority, noted that Mr. Sanders had been criticized for not sufficiently connecting racial and economic justice. \u201cBlack women like myself, we\u2019ve never gone for the okey-doke\u201d that fixing economic issues would solve other problems, she said. Of Mr. Sanders, she added, \u201cI\u2019m also willing to give the grace of, \u2018You\u2019ve got until February to convince me you finally get it.\u2019\u201d Mr. Campbell, the Sanders state director, said the senator had \u201cgrown in that regard.\u201d \u201cIf you listen to him talk about African-American communities, he doesn\u2019t shy away from the whole idea of racial discrimination,\u201d Mr. Campbell said. The campaign is certainly trying to organize black voters. Mariah Moore-McClure, an 18-year-old who moved from Chicago to attend Benedict College, a historically black college in Columbia, was part of a group the Sanders campaign had bused to the Galivants Ferry event about two hours away. \u201cOn my campus, he\u2019s doing great,\u201d she said. Within the Sanders campaign, tensions between the new guard and the originalists have been present throughout this run, including in a recent shake-up of his New Hampshire operation. In an interview, Mr. Campbell took an oblique swipe at those who ran South Carolina for Mr. Sanders four years ago. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a solid state team from the state that knows the state,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that\u2019s different from last time.\u201d Mr. Sanders\u2019s 2016 base \u2014 which generally skews younger, whiter and more progressive \u2014 remains the core of his 2020 coalition. At Galivants Ferry, the three volunteers at his booth in the early evening were supporters dating to 2016. \u201cIf we have anything to do with it,\u201d said Goffinet McLaren, who is white and a retiree who lives in Pawleys Island, \u201cwe would encourage black voters to vote for him this time.\u201d",

      "author": "Matt Stevens",
      "content": " Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont proposed a new corporate tax on Monday that would penalize some of the country\u2019s largest companies if they did not narrow the gap between what they pay their chief executives and what they pay their workers. The proposal is the latest measure from Mr. Sanders aimed at reducing income inequality \u2014 a pillar of his campaign for the Democratic nomination for president. It is also the latest example of the commitment by Mr. Sanders and his leading progressive rival, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, to use America\u2019s tax system to address the wide gulf between ordinary Americans and the rich. \u201cThe American people are sick and tired of corporate C.E.O.s who now make 300 times more than their average employees, while they give themselves huge bonuses and cut back on the health care and pension benefits of their employees,\u201d Mr. Sanders said in a statement. \u201cThey want corporations to invest in their workers, not just dividends, stock buybacks and outrageous compensation packages to their executives.\u201d Mr. Sanders\u2019s proposal would impose tax rate increases on companies whose chief executives make at least 50 times what their typical workers earn. The tax would apply to all private and publicly held corporations with annual revenue of more than $100 million, the Sanders campaign said. The tax penalties would begin at half a percentage point for companies that compensate their highest-paid employees between 50 and 100 times as much as their typical workers, then escalate as the pay gap increases. The biggest penalty \u2014 5 percentage points \u2014 would apply to companies that pay their top executives more than 500 times what they pay a typical worker. Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign said that if current pay patterns continued, the plan would raise about $150 billion over the next decade; the revenue would be used to pay for a plan he released earlier this month to eliminate an estimated $81 billion in existing medical debt. He followed that three days later by proposing an annual tax on the fortunes of the richest Americans, an idea that Ms. Warren has made a centerpiece of her presidential bid. The tax plans the two candidates have proposed would need to be passed by Congress to become law, an unlikely scenario if Republicans retain control of the Senate. Together, Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders have used the 2020 Democratic primary to offer up a substantial rethinking of the federal government\u2019s approach to taxation that would shift more of the burden of paying for government toward the wealthy. \u201cAt a time of massive income and wealth inequality, the American people are demanding that large, profitable corporations pay their fair share of taxes,\u201d Mr. Sanders said in his statement on his corporate tax proposal. \u201cIt is time to send a message to corporate America: If you do not end your greed and corruption, we will end it for you.\u201d Ms. Warren also wants to change how the country\u2019s most profitable corporations are taxed in order to ensure that they are paying their \u201cfair share.\u201d In April, she proposed a new tax on corporations that report more than $100 million in profits. Ms. Warren has another proposal about big corporations, the Accountable Capitalism Act, that addresses executive compensation. The proposal would restrict when top executives can sell company shares, and it would require that workers elect at least 40 percent of a company\u2019s board of directors.",

Pete Buttigieg raised $19.1 million and Kamala Harris $11.6 million, at a time when donations signal viability.By Shane GoldmacherPRINT EDITIONSanders Posts Biggest Quarter, Adding $25 Million |October 2, 2019, Page A19",
      "author": "Shane Goldmacher",
      "content": " Senator Bernie Sanders has produced the biggest fund-raising quarter of the Democratic primary, as his campaign announced on Tuesday that he had taken in $25.3 million over the last three months. Now the big questions looming over the donor race are whether Senator Elizabeth Warren will surpass him, and whether former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. will trail far behind. Mr. Sanders\u2019s third quarter haul is the latest demonstration of the rising power of small donors to reshape presidential politics. His campaign moved swiftly on Tuesday to assert his financial might, reserving his first television ads of the campaign \u2014 a two-week, $1.3 million buy in Iowa. Yet President Trump displayed fund-raising might that far surpassed any of the Democrats. Republican Party officials said that his re-election campaign and the Republican National Committee had raised $125 million over the last three months, a presidential fund-raising record. Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren have yet to share their much-anticipated totals. But Ms. Warren\u2019s figure is prompting much speculation; she is widely expected to improve upon the $19 million that she raised last quarter as she has surged in the polls to become Mr. Biden\u2019s leading rival. The expectations game is perhaps most fraught for Mr. Biden, whose efforts to fashion himself as the clear front-runner mean that any slippage from the top of the ranks represents a risk. Both Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders have boycotted the big-money circuit, raising the possibility of a watershed moment: The two top fund-raisers in the Democratic Party might end up being candidates who have turned their backs on the established class of political bundlers and financiers who have held sway for decades. The third quarter is known as perhaps the toughest to raise money in, as big donors are often out of town vacationing in July and August while small contributors spend less time online in the summer. But the money totals are critical not only to set budgets, hire staff and run ads but also because they mark the last time in 2019 that campaigns must open their books, hardening public perception of viability \u2014 or lack of it \u2014 during a crucial three-month period. The quarter ended on Monday and campaigns have until Oct. 15 to share their financial figures. Those without enough money can be winnowed quickly from the field; a half-dozen Democratic candidates have already called it quits this year. \u201cIt dictates the narrative in the lead-up to the elections,\u201d said Rufus Gifford, who served as finance director for President Barack Obama\u2019s re-election campaign and has donated to multiple 2020 candidates. \u201cThe big game that\u2019s going on inside the campaigns is how to manage expectations.\u201d The string of fund-raising announcements began early Tuesday morning with Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., who announced that he had raised $19.1 million in the third quarter. It was a dip from the field-leading $24.9 million he posted in the previous quarter, but more than enough to fully fund his once-upstart campaign into this fall and winter. Mr. Buttigieg has developed a grass-roots following, pairing his 580,000 donors with an aggressive calendar of dozens of traditional fund-raising events. Senator Kamala Harris announced an $11.6 million haul \u2014 nearly matching her totals in the first two quarters. She was the only campaign to announce her cash on hand: nearly $10 million, down from $13.3 million at the end of June, meaning she spent more than she raised in the last three months. Mr. Biden raised $22 million in the last quarter, second to Mr. Buttigieg. But there are signs his fund-raising operation has slowed, particularly online, where Mr. Biden has slashed his advertising budget. While Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders did not have to fill their calendars with fund-raisers, Mr. Biden raced across the country in the last three months, from Florida to California, Aspen to the Hamptons, holding more than 40 donor events. His wife, Dr. Jill Biden, headlined another dozen. This weekend, top Biden donors and bundlers have been invited to a retreat in Philadelphia to discuss the campaign\u2019s next phase. Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign has said he scored his best week of fund-raising since the second week of the campaign as Democrats initiated an impeachment inquiry of Mr. Trump over a whistle-blower complaint claiming that Mr. Trump prodded the president of Ukraine to investigate the business dealings there of Mr. Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden. Still, some Biden supporters are nervous about how the impeachment process, and any added scrutiny of Hunter Biden\u2019s business affairs, will play out. Some have even discussed creating a super PAC, which the campaign quickly disavowed. Others see in Ms. Warren\u2019s rise as a top rival, with Mr. Sanders in third, an opportunity for Mr. Biden to truly consolidate a donor class that has remained fractured. Mr. Biden\u2019s ability to attract small donors will be closely scrutinized. In the last 90 days, his campaign ranked 10th among the Democratic presidential candidates for advertising dollars on Facebook, where campaigns often prospect for new contributors. He spent less than one-quarter of what Mr. Buttigieg had spent on the platform in that time, and well less than half of what Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders had spent, according to Facebook data. Mr. Biden told donors at a sushi restaurant in Los Angeles last week that he had nearly 670,000 donations overall with an average donation of $46, which would translate to only about $10.8 million this quarter. A Biden campaign official said the former vice president had not presented the \u201cfull picture\u201d but declined to elaborate. A Biden campaign official said Tuesday that the former vice president had \u201cunequivocally\u2019\u2019 raised enough money to be competitive in the primary race, and that details would be released soon. [Sign up for our politics newsletter and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race.] Steve Westly, a bundler for Mr. Biden in California, said that skeptics and critics place too much importance on any one measurement of Mr. Biden\u2019s candidacy. \u201cEvery time someone is a front-runner, they say, \u2018Oh my gosh, they\u2019re not ahead in every straw poll, ahead in every state and every fund-raising report,\u2019\u201d Mr. Westly said. \u201cThe reality is you want to be in first place, which is where Joe Biden is.\u201d Harold Schaitberger, a close Biden ally and president of the International Association of Fire Fighters, which has endorsed Mr. Biden, compared the race to a schoolyard game of \u201cking of the hill.\u201d \u201cIf you\u2019re the king and you\u2019re on the hill, everybody else \u2014 in this case certainly within the Democratic candidates and the Republican Party \u2014 are doing everything they can to take you off the hill,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the point of it.\u201d He said he had \u201cseen no indication of any concern\u201d about resources. For Mr. Sanders, his $25.3 million quarter \u2014 which included his second biggest day for fund-raising of the campaign, on Monday \u2014 was a welcome reprieve from weeks of questions about his pathway as he has stagnated in the polls and has been passed on the left by Ms. Warren. (In one Iowa poll, more of those who caucused with Mr. Sanders in 2016 said they planned to support Ms. Warren in 2020 than him.) \u201cMedia elites and professional pundits have tried repeatedly to dismiss this campaign,\u201d said Faiz Shakir, Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign manager, \u201cand yet working-class Americans keep saying loudly and clearly that they want a political revolution.\u201d For Mr. Buttigieg, the third quarter was a period of rapid expansion: He went from zero field offices in the early states to 42, and his staff jumped to 400 people. Mr. Buttigieg, who began the year as a little-known mayor, has raised more than $51 million for the year, a remarkable sum for a newcomer to the national scene. But he has struggled to translate that cash into support beyond single digits in the polls. While Ms. Harris\u2019s haul was similar to her previous quarters, she entered October on a far different trajectory. She began the quarter riding high from her June debate performance \u2014 raising $4 million in the last four days of that month \u2014 but had faded by late September, promising to refocus on Iowa amid a staff shake-up.  One other campaign announced its numbers Tuesday: Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey raised more than $6 million, his best quarter yet. Ten days ago, in a gambit to draw attention and donations, Mr. Booker\u2019s campaign said he would quit the race if he did not collect at least $1.7 million; he raised more than $2.1 million. The quarterly fund-raising report will be the first for Beto O\u2019Rourke, the former Texas representative, since the shooting in his hometown of El Paso that appeared to give his candidacy fresh purpose. Andrew Yang, the New York executive running a web-savvy campaign centered on the idea of giving away $1,000 to every American every month, is expected to post by far his best haul of the campaign.",

      "author": "Lisa Lerer",
      "content": " For months, Senator Bernie Sanders brushed off questions about his age, offering a simple, six-word mantra to those who doubt he\u2019s energetic enough to run for president: \u201cFollow me around the campaign trail.\u201d But in the hours before the chest pains that led to an emergency procedure in a Las Vegas hospital, Mr. Sanders, 78, uttered a different, perhaps more telling, series of six words. \u201cGet me a chair up here,\u201d he said, turning to his deputy campaign manager on Tuesday, before sitting down in front of the crowd of 250 gathered for a fund-raiser in a Persian restaurant. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long day here.\u201d For months, Democrats have watched as a trio of septuagenarians commanded a majority of support in their crowded primary field: Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., 76, Senator Elizabeth Warren, 70, and Mr. Sanders, have consistently led in the contest to face President Trump, 73, next year. Presidential campaigns always reflect the hopes and fears \u2014 or, as political strategists call them, the \u201ckitchen table conversations\u201d \u2014 of the voters who cast the ballots. And this year, along with health care costs and college affordability, stagnant wages and immigration, the contest also reflects another issue, one that strikes at the heart of a country where the highest share of the electorate will be older than 65 since at least 1970: How old is too old? Voters, who have watched candidates through debate stages and state party dinners, on sweaty stages and speed-walking across the state fair, corn dog in hand, do not generally want to say there is a ceiling. No one is too old to be doing this. They just are not sure they would want to be keeping up such a rigorous schedule in their 70s. Would you? Gerontologists and other experts in aging say there is simply no way to definitively address the question of an upper age limit on the rigors of the presidency. \u201cThere\u2019s no answer. It\u2019s unknowable,\u201d said Dr. Mark Lachs, co-chief of Geriatric and Palliative Medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian. \u201cIt\u2019s true that rates of physical and cognitive impairment are age dependent but there\u2019s all kind of variability.\u201d The averages paint a sobering picture: The average life expectancy in the United States is just under 79, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Even as Americans live longer than ever before, about 85 percent of older adults have at least one chronic disease, and more than three-quarters have at least two. But despite the statistics, one person\u2019s 70 can be another\u2019s 60, Dr. Lachs said. And being 70 years old, he added, is not at all what it used to be. \u201cThe yardstick gets moved every decade because the country is aging and medical care becomes better,\u201d he said. \u201cAge should not be a disqualification for the presidency.\u201d That\u2019s a message some voters happily believe, as they confront the realities of aging in their own lives. The number of Americans who plan to retire after age 66 has steadily ticked up over the past quarter century, with a quarter saying they do not plan to retire at all. \u201cSeventy is the new fifty,\u201d said Halliestine Zimmerman, a retired accountant from Greenville, S.C., who celebrated her 70th birthday in June, a week before Ms. Warren did. \u201cYou don\u2019t really think I am at the end of my life span, you think more you are in the middle. I know what it is I want out of my life, and you know how to get it.\u201d Ms. Zimmerman\u2019s husband, whose age she would only give as \u201c70 plus,\u201d had a triple bypass several years ago and today he regularly plays tennis. \u201cHe\u2019s doing fantastic, so a stent doesn\u2019t bother me at all,\u201d she said, of Mr. Sanders. \u201cI don\u2019t think he will stop campaigning, I don\u2019t think he should \u2014 remember a lot of people don\u2019t make it to his age.\u201d But others worry that an older commander-in-chief would share the declines they have experienced in their own physical and mental abilities over the years. Discussions of aging have been all-but-inescapable on the campaign trail. Since he entered the race, Mr. Biden has been dogged by questions about his physical fitness and condition \u2014 concerns he has tried to alleviate by bounding through parade routes and shaking dozens of hands in steamy summer weather. Mr. Sanders keeps a blistering campaign schedule that often includes multiple events in multiple cities each day. And supporters of Ms. Warren gush about her vitality, bragging about the hundreds of selfies she takes with supporters after each appearance. \u201cI was just amazed that when you first came out here, Senator Warren, that you ran up those steps the way that you did, and all this energy and stamina that you have,\u201d Nikita L. Jackson, a Rock Hill, S.C., city councilwoman, said as she praised Ms. Warren to a crowd at a town hall event on Saturday. None of the Democratic candidates have been particularly eager to delve into the details of their health. Aides to Mr. Sanders released a brief statement noting that he \u201cwas found to have a blockage in one artery and two stents were successfully inserted,\u201d a fairly common procedure in the United States. Like his rivals, Mr. Sanders has not yet released his medical records, though all three have vowed to do so before the Iowa caucuses in February. With little actual medical information, even minor irregularities in how candidates appear have prompted a flurry of age-related speculation. When Mr. Sanders hit his head on the edge of a glass shower door, his campaign explained that he had received a cut requiring stitches but stressed that he did not fall. Mr. Biden appeared to be moving his mouth in a strange fashion during the last debate, which led to questions about whether he wore dentures. At Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign events, voters question whether his verbal missteps can be attributed to his age. \u201cHe\u2019s not as sharp as he might be,\u201d said Carol Sobelson, 63, at a campaign event in Concord, N.H. \u201cHe\u2019s done a lot for our country, he was a great vice president. He\u2019s probably not my first choice.\u201d Health, or the perception of a candidate\u2019s health, is unlikely to be off the table in a campaign against Mr. Trump. In 2016, his supporters spliced together video footage of Hillary Clinton coughing and Mr. Trump often questioned her stamina, particularly after she abruptly left a ceremony in New York honoring the 15th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks. Already, Mr. Trump has started questioning Mr. Biden\u2019s energy levels, nicknaming him \u201cSleepy Joe.\u201d Nearly all Democrats prefer candidates in their 40s through 60s, according to surveys. When asked about the ideal age for a president, just 3 percent said the 70s, according to polling released by Pew Research Center in May. Other polls have shown that Americans express more discomfort with a candidate in their 70s than one who is gay, Muslim or an independent. The two Democratic nominees who have won the White House since 1992 \u2014 Bill Clinton and Barack Obama \u2014 made generational change a key part of their winning campaign message. Both were the youngest in their primary fields.",

      "content": " CHAPEL HILL, N.C. \u2014 College students are back on campus. Bernie Sanders is, too. Earlier this month at Iowa State University, he lectured to young voters as they played \u201cGreen New Deal Pong\u201d (the Solo cups were filled with green-colored water) and \u201cBern Bag Toss.\u201d At the University of Nevada, Reno, he croaked through a hoarse voice to address a crowd that stretched from the college lawn to the open-air floors of a parking garage beside it. And at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill on Thursday evening, he implored students to get themselves to the primary polls come February \u2014 and vote for him. \u201cYou have friends out there, and I know you do, who think that the political system\u201d is absurd, he said, using a colorful expletive. \u201cTell them that instead of just complaining, they must get involved into the political process.\u201d It was a sentiment he has repeated often this month as he crisscrossed the country on what has amounted to a whirlwind back-to-school tour. In Iowa, Nevada, North Carolina and South Carolina, he has by turns used flattery (\u201cYour generation is the most progressive younger generation in the history of this country\u201d) and subtle warnings (\u201cThe future of this country and in fact the world rests with your generation\u201d) to bolster his appeals. Everywhere, his goal was the same: muster a version of the army of young voters who propelled his campaign in 2016. His message was one that has resonated with Brianna Williams, 19, who arrived with a group of friends to hear him in Chapel Hill. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of his policies, and I\u2019m just excited for what he has to offer as a candidate,\u201d she said. But she was just as excited by Senator Elizabeth Warren. \u201cI would love to see a woman running the country,\u201d she said. \u201cThat would be really cool.\u201d Last time around, Mr. Sanders\u2019s rants against the elite and promises of free college tuition endeared him to legions of young fans. It also helped that Mr. Sanders \u2014 74 at the time, with unruly white hair and an old-school Brooklyn accent \u2014 was both decidedly uncool and new to presidential politics, affording his campaign a paradoxical edge that inspired millions of young supporters to \u201cfeel the bern\u201d and vote for him over Hillary Clinton. As he fights anew for the Democratic nomination, it is not lost on him or his allies that his success hinges, in no small part, on his ability to capture that enthusiasm again \u2014 for both the optics of his race and the actual votes. But this time he is no longer an insurgent, nor is he the only anti-establishment candidate in the race \u2014 factors that helped boost his standing among young voters. With the race entering the crucial fall period, other candidates, including Ms. Warren and Andrew Yang, have begun siphoning off some of his support. [Sign up for our politics newsletter hosted by Lisa Lerer and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race.] Even Mr. Sanders\u2019s closest advisers acknowledge that he cannot take for granted a voting cohort they view as critical, even if it is traditionally unreliable in actually making it to the ballot box. \u201cLast time it was much more organic,\u201d Faiz Shakir, Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign manager, said. \u201cAnd this time it\u2019s far more intentional.\u201d In interviews, many young voters still praised Mr. Sanders, sometimes breathlessly \u2014 citing his authenticity and conviction but also his calls for free college and universal health care and his proposal to cancel student debt. But many also expressed curiosity, if not exuberance, about other candidates \u201cI love everything he stands for,\u201d said Asha Loutsch, 18, as she sat with a circle of friends who were waiting for his event at the University of Iowa. \u201cI think he really cares about what he\u2019s trying to say. Like, he\u2019s always getting up in there, you know?\u201d But she also said she was interested in Ms. Warren and wanted to hear her speak. Jiego Lim, an 18-year-old student at the University of Nevada, Reno, who was volunteering at Mr. Sanders\u2019s event there, said he supported Mr. Sanders but was also intrigued by Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Senator Kamala Harris. \u201cI feel like we need a fresh new face in politics,\u201d he said. \u201cBernie comes off aggressive to me sometimes.\u201d Others were less equivocal. \u201cHe\u2019s America\u2019s dad,\u201d offered Gabriel Olier, 19, a student in Reno. \u201cI love Bernie.\u201d That affection for Mr. Sanders is reflected in some more tangible metrics. His campaign said it had so far raised over $1 million from people under the age of 25, a relatively small figure compared to his overall haul but one that nevertheless points to his continued strength with young voters. [Here\u2019s the latest data on who\u2019s leading the race to be the Democratic nominee.] And in most polls, Mr. Sanders still maintains a strong lead among young voters: A recent NBC/Wall Street Journal survey showed that a third of voters under 35 supported him. Yet at the same time, a quarter of these respondents said they supported Ms. Warren, suggesting Mr. Sanders no longer has the same hold on the group he had in 2016. Any candidate relying on the support of younger voters faces an undeniable challenge: Younger voters tend not to vote in high numbers compared with other groups. In the 2016 election, for instance, only 11 percent of voters under 30 participated in the Iowa caucuses, representing just 15 percent of the total, according to an estimate from the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts University. But the high turnout among young voters during the 2018 midterm elections has given some experts hope that the 2020 election will be different. That strong showing has provided organizers with a larger pool to identify and target potential presidential voters. Issues, including climate change, criminal justice, health care and gun control, are also motivating young voters to act. \u201cThe truth is that if younger people in this country voted at the same level as people 65 and over, we could transform this country,\u201d Mr. Sanders said this month at the University of Iowa. \u201cPlease do it!\u201d John Della Volpe, the director of polling at Harvard\u2019s Institute of Politics, said that Mr. Sanders was still \u201cdoing really well\u201d but that the field was more complex and his pool of support was smaller. \u201cAt this stage, he\u2019s essentially sharing support of young people in most polls with Elizabeth Warren,\u201d Mr. Della Volpe said. \u201cThe idea of going after structural reforms is really, I think, what is resonating so clearly with young people.\u201d Indeed, of all the other candidates, it is Ms. Warren who appears to be generating the most powerful wave of energy among young voters in Democratic presidential politics \u2014 particularly among those who once supported Mr. Sanders. Olivia Stecklein, 19, a student at the University of Iowa, said she had been a fan of Mr. Sanders since 2015 but was now choosing between him and Ms. Warren. \u201cI feel like they\u2019re pretty similar, but I just kind of like how Elizabeth Warren has a set-out plan for everything,\u201d she said. \u201cShe just seems very prepared.\u201d Eliza Link, 18, a University of Iowa student, said she was also deciding between Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren. \u201cI think they\u2019re both the cool aunt and uncle of the political race right now,\u201d she said. With his characteristic verve that can exhaust even young reporters, Mr. Sanders has been in an all-out sprint to earn the vote of the youths, months before any of them can even cast their vote. His team set up a Bernie Summer School program to train campus leaders in the art of campaigning. He urged his campaign to get him back on college campuses in the first weeks of the new school year. He constantly asks his team to share data on young voters. To win over the group, however, Mr. Sanders will have to convince people like Tim Watts, 19. Before Mr. Sanders\u2019s event in Reno, Mr. Watts wore a \u201cMATH\u201d hat, the universal accessory of Yang supporters. But despite his overt support for Mr. Yang \u2014 who in some ways is benefiting from the outsider status among young voters that Mr. Sanders enjoyed in 2016 \u2014 Mr. Watts said he had not yet closed the door on Mr. Sanders. \u201cI\u2019m part of the Yang gang, I guess,\u201d he said. \u201cI will probably feel the bern later.\u201d",

      "content": " LOS ANGELES \u2014 With Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s announcement on Friday that she raised $24.6 million in the past three months, the fund-raising picture for the leading Democratic presidential contenders has come into focus: Ms. Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders are in strong position to fund their campaigns over the long haul. Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders, whose campaign announced raising $25.3 million in the third quarter, both brought in more money than they had in the previous quarter, while money totals were down for two of their top competitors, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. Ms. Warren\u2019s total also offers further evidence of her steady rise to the top of the pack in the Democratic primary race, where she now rivals Mr. Biden as a leading contender for the nomination. And while Mr. Sanders trails both of them in recent polls, he has a loyal following that has supported him with millions of small donations this year, ensuring that he is well positioned for a primary season that could stretch through next spring. More broadly, the fund-raising totals show the collective enthusiasm in the party for progressive candidates pushing messages of sweeping change. And they demonstrate the undeniable power of online donors in the primary. Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders have sworn off courting wealthy donors and holding elite fund-raising events, while Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg \u2014 who raised $15.2 million and $19.1 million in the quarter, according to their campaigns \u2014 both pursue money from big donors. The fund-raising hauls by Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren show that there is \u201cstrength and power to their ideas that they\u2019re putting forward, and people are engaged,\u201d said Karen Finney, a Democratic strategist who was a senior adviser for Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign. \u201cI think for anybody else in the race, you have to pay attention to that \u2014 that there is energy around some of these big ideas that represent bigger changes,\u201d she said. Mr. Biden\u2019s total did little to bolster his status in the race. Already under siege from President Trump and no longer enjoying a clear lead over the rest of the field in national polls, Mr. Biden saw his fund-raising drop roughly 30 percent from the previous quarter. Mr. Sanders exceeded Mr. Biden\u2019s total by about $10 million and Ms. Warren exceeded it by more than $9 million \u2014 an indicator of the gulf between Mr. Biden and his two progressive rivals in attracting grass-roots support. And for the second consecutive quarter, Mr. Biden, a two-term vice president who previously served in the Senate for 36 years, was bested by Mr. Buttigieg, the mayor of the fourth most populous city in the 17th most populous state. Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign said on Friday that it had received 943,000 donations in the third quarter from 509,000 donors, and more than 300,000 of those donors gave to her presidential campaign for the first time. The average donation was $26, and Ms. Warren ended the quarter with $25.7 million in cash on hand, according to her campaign. \u201cPlease take a moment to be proud of the movement you\u2019re helping build,\u201d Roger Lau, Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign manager, wrote in an email to supporters. \u201cClose your eyes and picture Wall Street bankers scowling into their catered breakfast,\u201d he suggested. Collecting small contributions from a vast group of donors comes with a huge long-term advantage: Those donors can keep giving again and again as the campaign goes on. That is not the case for wealthy donors writing $2,800 checks to candidates \u2014 the maximum an individual can give to a campaign for the primary race. Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders \u201care breaking these old political models in which rich donors can capture and control political parties,\u201d said Stephanie Taylor, a co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which is supporting Ms. Warren. \u201cThis is just a really revolutionary, seismic shift in American politics.\u201d Beating Mr. Sanders\u2019s total for the past three months would have given another jolt of momentum to Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign. Instead, Mr. Sanders\u2019s status as the top fund-raiser for the quarter provides a reminder of his sizable base of support, even as other indicators like polling are less favorable. In the long run, Mr. Sanders\u2019s slight financial edge over Ms. Warren in the quarter is unlikely to make a major difference in the perceptions of their candidacies. Mr. Sanders entered the race having already established an enormous network of donors during his 2016 presidential campaign, and he raised slightly less in the third quarter of 2019 than he did during the same time period in 2015. \u201cThe biggest takeaway is that Warren is on a roll,\u201d said Stephanie Cutter, a Democratic strategist and veteran of past presidential campaigns. \u201cShe\u2019s got wind at her back. It\u2019s evident in her polls, her fund-raising and the energy at her events.\u201d Among other candidates who have disclosed their fund-raising for the third quarter, Senator Kamala Harris raised $11.6 million, Andrew Yang raised more than $10 million and Senator Cory Booker raised more than $6 million, according to their campaigns. Presidential candidates must report their fund-raising for the quarter, which covered July through September, to the Federal Election Commission by Oct. 15. Ms. Warren struggled with fund-raising at the beginning of her campaign, but those struggles ended up being short-lived. Her third-quarter haul is another validation of her strategy to rely on online donors to finance her campaign. That choice is central to her bid for the presidency, freeing up her schedule and creating a tidy contrast with some of her rivals: While other candidates gather with rich donors, Ms. Warren spends hours taking pictures with voters who wait in the \u201cselfie line\u201d at her town-hall-style events. \u201cI made the decision early on I was not going to spend my time behind closed doors with corporate executives and bazillionaires,\u201d Ms. Warren told the crowd at a town hall in Carson City, Nev., on Wednesday night. \u201cI was going to spend my time here.\u201d At a town hall in San Diego on Thursday night, she reached her latest selfie-related milestone: She has now taken pictures with an estimated 70,000 people since beginning her campaign. She made it to the end of the selfie line just before midnight.",

On Friday evening, doctors confirmed he had suffered a heart attack.By Lawrence K. Altman, M.D.PRINT EDITIONUncommon Reticence After a Common Procedure|October 5, 2019",
      "author": "Lawrence K. Altman, M.D.",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 \u201cNone of us know when a medical emergency will affect us,\u201d Senator Bernie Sanders wrote in a tweet from Desert Springs Hospital Medical Center on Wednesday, hours after the 78-year-old Democratic candidate for president experienced one. Mr. Sanders\u2019s emergency \u2014 the sudden onset of chest pain known as angina \u2014 is one that thousands of other Americans experience each year. Mr. Sanders\u2019s discomfort occurred at a campaign event on Tuesday night. Because it signaled acute heart trouble, the senator went to the hospital where doctors implanted two stents in one of the coronary arteries that nourish the heart. Doctors often release patients who undergo such procedures in a day or two. Mr. Sanders remained in the hospital until Friday evening, when \u2014 after three days of revealing few details about his condition \u2014 his campaign confirmed that Mr. Sanders had suffered a heart attack. Until then, Mr. Sanders had not disclosed whether blood and electrocardiogram tests showed he had a heart attack. The senator and his campaign have not allowed reporters to interview his doctors, though advisers have said that Mr. Sanders would be able to appear in the next Democratic debate on Oct. 15. With respect to release of health information, President Trump has not had a medical emergency while running for or serving in office, but he disclosed few specific laboratory test results initially in his 2016 campaign. He issued a four-paragraph letter from his personal physician stating that Mr. Trump would be \u201cthe healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.\u201d Closer to the 2016 election date, Mr. Trump\u2019s doctor offered a more conventional letter that still omitted a number of details that would be part of a customary summary of a patient\u2019s health. In 2018, the doctor, Harold N. Bornstein, said that Trump aides had raided his office a year earlier and taken the president\u2019s medical files after The Times reported that the president had taken a drug for hair growth. And this year, the White House physician pronounced Mr. Trump in \u201cvery good health\u201d although the president had gained weight and is now officially obese. The health questions hang over Mr. Sanders in part because he would become the nation\u2019s oldest president by far if elected. Also, given that implanting two stents in one coronary artery is a very common procedure in American hospitals, it was puzzling that for several days he did not release more details. Mr. Sanders is a private person, no doubt, but most modern-day presidents and serious candidates for the presidency have put forward details to inform the electorate after emergency health issues. Normally, \u201crecovery from stent placement is very quick,\u201d and patients usually go home a day or two after the procedure, said Dr. Jonathan S. Reiner, a cardiologist at George Washington University Hospital in Washington, D.C. who treated former Vice President Dick Cheney for serious heart disease for many years before, during and after his two terms of office. Dr. Reiner is not involved in Mr. Sanders\u2019s care. Older patients and those who experience complications like heart rhythm abnormalities, heart attacks or heart failure may remain in the hospital longer. A patient\u2019s condition usually determines the length of stay. In the 2016 presidential campaign, Mr. Sanders\u2019s doctor said that the senator was \u201cin overall very good health.\u201d His ailments included gout; a mild elevation of cholesterol; an inflammation of out-pouches in the bowel known as diverticulitis; and hormone replacement therapy for an underactive thyroid gland. He had no reported history of heart disease. Tuesday\u2019s episode of angina appears to be his first such incident. In cases like Mr. Sanders\u2019s, doctors perform a standard procedure known as cardiac catheterization. In it, they thread thin tubes into chambers of the heart and inject a radio-opaque dye to produce X-rays outlining the coronary arteries. For Mr. Sanders, the procedure revealed blockage in one artery; he has not said which artery. Doctors would then remove the blockage, which is usually caused by deposits of fatty substances, by inflating a tiny balloon in a tube to squash them. Implanting the stents aims at preventing development of scar tissue and recurrence of the blockage. All presidential hopefuls strive to portray themselves in good health. When a medical event occurs, candidates and their aides, who usually have had little if any medical knowledge, often scurry to play it down to prevent damage to the leader\u2019s image. Mr. Sanders\u2019s event is likely to renew pressure on his rivals to release their health information in a timely fashion. Although some have made pledges, they have not done so. In recent years, most candidates have released their personal health information in statements from their doctors or through interviews. The practice grew out of retrospective analyses of the health of presidents that document how some presidents hid or lied about their health problems, often aided by their doctors. Occasionally, White House doctors have misdiagnosed a president\u2019s heart and vascular problems. Experts believe that President Warren Harding died of a heart attack that his doctor did not detect. Toward the end of President Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s third term and until his death in his fourth term, his White House doctor withheld the fact that he had serious heart failure. President Dwight D. Eisenhower suffered a heart attack near the end of his first term. Examination of his older medical records has provided strong clues that he had a heart attack before he ran for president. In 1999, former Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey damaged his presidential campaign by not disclosing that he had a number of episodes of atrial fibrillation (a heart rhythm abnormality) before he experienced one while campaigning and had to rush to a hospital in the Bay Area with reporters trailing him. Among the current candidates, Joseph R. Biden Jr. underwent emergency surgery in 1988 for a near-fatal ruptured berry aneurysm of an artery in his brain. He also underwent surgery to remove a second berry aneurysm. New cerebral aneurysms can develop years later in a tiny percentage of individuals who have survived one. In 2008, Mr. Biden\u2019s doctor said that he had recovered fully, and that he did not need further tests to detect a new berry aneurysm because he had done well for 20 years. Modern medicine has enabled many individuals with heart disease and other chronic ailments to successfully run for office and fulfill their duties. Nevertheless, Mr. Sanders\u2019s stent episode is likely to renew a measure of voter interest in the health of its 2020 presidential candidates. Two other leading Democratic hopefuls are in their 70s and President Trump is 73. All of them, as well as Mr. Sanders, may well be medically fit to serve, but Americans have never faced the prospects or consequences of so many top candidates who were past the official retirement age.",

      "author": "Margot Sanger-Katz",
      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 Bernie Sanders has long wanted to remake the health care system so no one will have to pay directly for medical care again. Now, he also wants to go back and cancel all the medical debts of people who have been billed under the current system. In a plan released Saturday, Mr. Sanders, the Vermont senator and presidential candidate, proposes wiping out an estimated $81 billion in existing debt and changing rules around debt collection and bankruptcy. He also calls for replacing the giant credit reporting agencies with a \u201cpublic credit registry\u201d that would ignore medical debt when calculating credit scores. The proposals reflect Mr. Sanders\u2019s concern that the medical system has placed financial hardships on too many Americans, by discouraging them from seeking needed medical care \u2014 but also by saddling them with expensive and unfair bills that can harm their financial security, ding their credit and, in some cases, lead to bankruptcy. The plan is Mr. Sanders\u2019s latest effort to transform the health care system in America, a goal on which he has staked not just his second presidential run, but much of his political legacy. His proposal also separates him from other presidential candidates: While several of them have come to embrace his \u201cMedicare for all\u201d plan to create a government-run health insurance system, he is the first top-tier contender to call for such drastic measures on medical debt. \u201cWe\u2019re addressing it on both ends,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cWe\u2019re addressing it now by trying to help the people who have past due medical bills. And we\u2019re addressing it by finally creating a health care system that guarantees coverage to people without any premiums, without any deductibles, without any out-of-pocket expenses.\u201d [Sign up for our politics newsletter and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race.] Medical debt affects Americans who lack health insurance, of course. But it is also increasingly affecting people who have insurance with holes, like high deductibles or limited networks of doctors whose care is paid for. Around 16 percent of adults with credit reports have at least one medical debt, according to a study published last year in the journal Health Affairs. The plan calls for the government to negotiate and cancel the debts, though it does not specify the precise mechanism. While eliminating every American\u2019s medical debt would probably not come cheap, Mr. Sanders\u2019s plan could wind up costing far less than the total amount of debt he is seeking to cancel. Craig Antico, a founder of the charity RIP Medical Debt, which buys and forgives medical debt, estimated that the market price for $81 billion in debt could be as low as $500 million. Most past-due medical debt never gets paid, which is why bill collectors are often willing to sell the debts for pennies on the dollar. The plan would also create a public credit rating agency to \u201creplace\u201d for-profit companies like Equifax, and it would exclude medical debts from credit ratings. It would establish a new legal process, managed by the bankruptcy court system, to help adjudicate medical debts that are not yet in collections. Studies suggest that medical debts can be less damaging to people\u2019s credit than other kinds of debt, in part because the credit reporting agencies treat people\u2019s ability to pay medical bills as less predictive of creditworthiness than, say, their ability to pay credit card bills or car payments. And, despite the news media\u2019s focus on particularly large medical bills, the typical bill in collections is less than $600, according to the Health Affairs article. But medical debts do affect credit somewhat, and they can cause psychological stress, beyond the financial consequences. A survey of people with medical debts conducted by The New York Times and the Kaiser Family Foundation in 2016 found that 44 percent of adults under 65 who had problems paying medical bills said those bills had a \u201cmajor effect\u201d on their lives. Fear of medical debts causes some people to avoid needed medical care. And medical bills can affect other parts of people\u2019s finances that are harder to measure, showing up as an unpaid credit card bill or a missed loan payment. \u201cI have a belief that if a plan like this could eliminate the debt that\u2019s causing hardship, it could make a huge difference in people\u2019s lives,\u201d Mr. Antico said. The Sanders campaign circulated statistics suggesting that more than 500,000 Americans declare bankruptcy each year because of medical bills. That number, derived from a survey of bankrupt individuals, overstates the impact of medical bills on bankruptcy. The study itself noted that health problems can cause bankruptcies in two ways, through direct medical bills and through lost income due to illness itself. The 500,000 figure includes both groups. Other research has shown that income losses due to illness are often the bigger financial hit than medical bills. Neither Mr. Sanders\u2019s \u201cMedicare for all\u201d plan nor his medical debt program would address that secondary issue, though he has also called for guaranteeing workers paid medical leave.  The plan \u201cis well targeted,\u201d said Neale Mahoney, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago, who studies medical debt. \u201cIt just may not be that much relief.\u201d [Which Democrats are leading the 2020 presidential race this week?] Mr. Sanders said that, in conversations with people around the country, he had come to see medical debt as the most consistent and visceral manifestation of a broken health care system. At an event this month in Carson City, Nev., for instance, he heard from a veteran who said he had $139,000 in medical debt. When Mr. Sanders asked the man how he would pay off the debt, the man responded: \u201cI can\u2019t. I can\u2019t. I\u2019m going to kill myself.\u201d Those kinds of deeply moving moments, he said, drove him to seek a new way to ameliorate that particular pain as part of his overall vision for changing the health care system. \u201cI have always believed that health care is a human right, and it has always disturbed me immensely that so many of our people are uninsured or underinsured and can\u2019t go to the doctor,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cBut I have learned in this campaign something else, which I didn\u2019t talk about previously, and that is the financial pain that this dysfunctional health care system is causing people.\u201d The new plan is part of a burst of policy-related activity from the Sanders campaign, which also released a housing plan last week that included a proposal to establish a national rent control standard.",

His proposal goes further in who would be taxed and how much money would be raised.By Thomas KaplanPRINT EDITIONA Candidate Opposed to Billionaires Unveils His Tax Proposal|September 25, 2019, Page A13",
      "author": "Thomas Kaplan",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Senator Bernie Sanders on Tuesday unveiled a proposal to create a new tax on the wealth of the richest Americans, including a steep tax on billionaires that could greatly diminish their fortunes. With the proposal, Mr. Sanders is embracing an idea that has been a centerpiece of the campaign of his top progressive rival, Senator Elizabeth Warren. But while Ms. Warren came first, Mr. Sanders is going bigger. His wealth tax would apply to a larger number of households, impose a higher top rate and raise more money. Mr. Sanders\u2019s plan to tax accumulated wealth, not just income, is particularly aggressive in how it would erode the fortunes of billionaires. His tax would cut in half the wealth of the typical billionaire after 15 years, according to two economists who worked with the Sanders campaign on the plan. Mr. Sanders would use the money generated by his wealth tax to fund the housing plan he released last week and a forthcoming plan for universal child care, as well as to help pay for \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d \u201cLet me be very clear: As president of the United States, I will reduce the outrageous and grotesque and immoral level of income and wealth inequality,\u201d Mr. Sanders said in an interview. \u201cWhat we are trying to do is demand and implement a policy which significantly reduces income and wealth inequality in America by telling the wealthiest families in this country they cannot have so much wealth.\u201d Asked if he thought billionaires should exist in the United States, Mr. Sanders said, \u201cI hope the day comes when they don\u2019t.\u201d He added, \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be tomorrow.\u201d [Sign up for our politics newsletter and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race.] \u201cI don\u2019t think that billionaires should exist,\u201d he said, adding that there would always be rich people and others with less money. \u201cThis proposal does not eliminate billionaires, but it eliminates a lot of the wealth that billionaires have, and I think that\u2019s exactly what we should be doing.\u201d The proposal from Mr. Sanders is the latest sign of the push in the Democratic Party to collect substantially more revenue from the wealthiest Americans by rethinking how they are taxed \u2014 a move that could provide large sums of money to finance new social programs. And it is a significant development in the competition of ideas between Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren, the two leading progressive candidates in the Democratic primary race. Both of their plans would need to be passed by Congress in order to take effect \u2014 a virtual impossibility unless Democrats win control of the Senate in the 2020 elections, and far from a sure thing even then. Ms. Warren\u2019s plan touched off a number of questions about the feasibility of creating a wealth tax, including whether such a tax would be constitutional, how it would be enforced and whether it would generate as much money as has been projected. On Tuesday, Ms. Warren welcomed Mr. Sanders\u2019s plan. \u201cI\u2019m delighted to see people talking about a wealth tax,\u201d she told WBUR. \u201cI think it\u2019s great because this is how we make big structural change in this economy. We need all of the presidential candidates talking about it; where are the rest of them?\u201d Mr. Sanders, of Vermont, would create an annual tax that would apply to households with a net worth above $32 million \u2014 about 180,000 households in total, or about the top 0.1 percent, according to the economists who worked on the plan. He would impose a 1 percent tax on net worth above $32 million, with increasing marginal rates topping out at 8 percent on net worth over $10 billion. For single filers, the brackets would be halved, meaning the tax would kick in at $16 million. By contrast, the wealth tax proposed by Ms. Warren, of Massachusetts, would apply to households with a net worth above $50 million \u2014 an estimated 70,000 households in total. The structure of her plan is simpler: She would apply a 2 percent tax on net worth from $50 million to $1 billion, and a 3 percent tax on net worth above $1 billion. Unlike the Sanders plan, the tax brackets would be the same for married and single filers. Mr. Sanders\u2019s tax is projected to raise $4.35 trillion over a decade, while Ms. Warren\u2019s is projected to raise $2.6 trillion over the same time period. Those estimates were produced by Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, two economists at the University of California, Berkeley, with whom both the Sanders and Warren campaigns consulted as they developed their proposals. (The projection for Ms. Warren\u2019s plan differs slightly from their original estimate of $2.75 trillion earlier this year.) \u201cThe Sanders plan is really pitched at the idea that we don\u2019t want billionaires and decabillionaires to be billionaires and decabillionaires for as long as they currently are,\u201d Mr. Saez said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to erode their fortunes much faster than the Warren wealth tax.\u201d Mr. Sanders included several steps in his plan to enforce the tax, including creating a \u201cnational wealth registry,\u201d increasing funding for the Internal Revenue Service and requiring audits of many taxpayers who are subject to the wealth tax, including all billionaires. Mr. Saez and Mr. Zucman calculated how the Warren and Sanders wealth taxes would have affected the fortunes of the richest Americans had each been in effect since 1982. The fortune of Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder who Forbes said was worth $160 billion last year, would have been $87 billion under the Warren plan and $43 billion under the Sanders plan. Over all, the economists found, the cumulative wealth of the top 15 richest Americans in 2018 \u2014 amounting to $943 billion, using estimates from Forbes \u2014 would have been $434 billion under the Warren plan and $196 billion under the Sanders plan. Mr. Sanders is hardly a newcomer to the idea of a wealth tax. In a 1997 book, he wrote that it was \u201ctime, high time, to establish a tax on wealth similar to those that exist in most European countries.\u201d In 2017, he included a wealth tax on a list of financing options for Medicare for all. Ms. Warren was quick to harness the idea in the 2020 race. She released her wealth tax proposal in January, weeks before Mr. Sanders began his campaign. Since then, the proposal has become a cornerstone of Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign and a fixture of her stump speech, even prompting chants of \u201cTwo cents!\u201d from crowds. The money from her tax would go toward other policy plans she has issued, including her proposals for universal child care, student debt cancellation and tuition-free public college.",

      "content": " IOWA CITY \u2014 Oliver Hanlon was beaming ear-to-ear as he stood next to Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts on a riverside stage at the University of Iowa. \u201cI met the president,\u201d he shouted, bounding down the steps two at a time. His mother gently corrected him: \u201cNot yet,\u201d she said, while the Warren photo line snaked on behind her. Oliver couldn\u2019t be faulted for his civics proficiency; he\u2019s 7 years old. The 2020 Democratic presidential campaign stops are crawling with children, some of whom spend most of the stump speeches crawling away from their parents. While all of the candidates seek to portray a family-friendly image, it takes work to bring a youngster to a campaign event: They often start late and run well into the evening, with a policy discussion not exactly accessible on the elementary-school level; bigger rallies often take place outdoors, regardless of weather. Kissing babies and tousling children\u2019s hair has long been a staple of retail campaigning, but in 2020 it is about more than a photo op, even the cutest of photo ops. In a historically crowded field, in an era of uncertain polling, these campaign stops are something of a past-their-bedtimes straw poll, revealing which candidates young parents deem viable or famous enough to risk a tantrum or a sleep-deprived meltdown over the next morning. For now, the leaders appear to be Ms. Warren and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who have both taken steps to cater to the children and parents who come see them. It\u2019s one more subtle measure of their stature in a race that is steadily narrowing from the largest primary field in history to just a handful of viable contenders. Ms. Warren and Mr. Biden, whose staffs both go to great lengths to present their events as family friendly, are currently atop the Democratic polls, which might explain the pep talk parents often give their children before meeting the two candidates: You are talking to the next president. Ms. Warren lets families with children cut to the front of her selfie line, a strong incentive given that supporters often wait hours for a 20-second interaction and photograph. Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign stops over the summer and fall have often come with free ice cream \u2014 and if frozen dairy products are not available, he\u2019s been known to hand out cash with instructions for children to tell their parents to stop for a treat on the way home. During a Labor Day swing through Iowa, Mr. Biden worked a chocolate-and-vanilla swirl machine at one union picnic and handed out ice cream sandwiches at another. Last month in Iowa City, Clara Engler, 5, spent hours before an evening Warren rally at the University of Iowa practicing the \u201cpinkie promise\u201d that has become a staple for young girls at Ms. Warren\u2019s events. With her mother, Brooke Engler, an Iowa City cosmetologist, Clara worked on locking fingers briefly and looking up, so she could hear Ms. Warren tell her that running for president is \u201cwhat girls do.\u201d When the moment came, about a half-hour after Clara\u2019s bedtime, Ms. Warren got down on one knee, looked her in the eye and made the promise. Clara jumped up with glee. Her mother beamed. \u201cShe\u2019d seen it before on TV,\u201d Ms. Engler said. \u201cIt\u2019s nice that I can have my child sit back and watch politics without worrying about what will be said.\u201d The others in the 19-candidate Democratic field aren\u2019t overtly inhospitable to children, but former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas peppers his stump speech with profanity and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont isn\u2019t a fuzzy figure while delivering his policy-heavy stemwinders. In early September he scolded a crying baby to \u201ckeep it down\u201d during a campaign stop in New Hampshire. Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., whose most fervent supporters tend to be young enough not to have children of their own, often attracts older kids \u2014 particularly L.G.B.T. teens inspired by the first openly gay major candidate for president. \u201cWhen you know that there\u2019s something historic about your campaign, you feel a level of responsibility that goes with that,\u201d Mr. Buttigieg said aboard his Iowa campaign bus last month. \u201cIt certainly adds a level of motivation when people come up to you, sometimes with tears in their eyes, just letting you know what the fact of your campaign means to them.\u201d Even in Iowa, where rare is the weekend without a presidential hopeful stumping nearby, it takes a serious commitment and coordination to attend a campaign event with young children. \u201cIf she starts crying we\u2019ll run out quickly,\u201d Elizabeth Batey, a lawyer from Waverly, Iowa, said of her 2-year-old daughter, Hattie, while waiting for Mr. Buttigieg last month in a stuffy storefront in Iowa Falls. Ms. Batey, whose 4-month-old son, George, was asleep in his car seat, made it through Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s event without having to flee. Afterward, she waited on the sidewalk in front of the Buttigieg campaign bus, holding one child in each arm. \u201cWow, you\u2019ve got your hands full,\u201d Mr. Buttigieg told her before pausing for a picture. Parents interviewed at a range of campaign events said they often felt like this political moment resembled a tawdry reality TV show, and they brought their children to see the 2020 candidates to try to demonstrate to them that politics can be something different. \u201cI can\u2019t let my kids listen to the TV without being ready to hit the mute button,\u201d said Julia Privett, a physician assistant who brought her 2-year-old daughter, Alyssa, to see Mr. Biden talk about climate change in Cedar Rapids. Lytishya Borglum, a Cedar Falls small business owner, brought her three middle-school-aged children to see Senator Kamala Harris of California speak at the University of Northern Iowa. She\u2019d taken her oldest daughter, 13-year-old Berlyn, to see Democratic caucus campaign events in 2008, but skipped 2016 because it was too toxic. \u201cNowadays, it\u2019s impossible for them not to be exposed to the craziness in the White House,\u201d Ms. Borglum said. At Ms. Warren\u2019s Iowa City rally, a parade of children waited with their parents for a picture with the senator. Kohner Reynolds, who will turn 2 in November, blew past his 7:30 p.m. bedtime. \u201cHe fell asleep a couple times in the baby carrier,\u201d said Kohner\u2019s mother, Callie Reynolds. \u201cI wanted him to be able to say he came to see her.\u201d Burgundy Johnson, a child psychologist, kept her 5-month-old son, Archer, up past his 8 o\u2019clock bedtime. She occupied Archer with toys. \u201cI wanted a picture of Elizabeth Warren holding my baby,\u201d she said while leaving the event at 8:40 p.m. \u201cNow it\u2019s going to be an interesting night.\u201d The older children tend to be more attuned to issues. Evelynn Parlet, 11, an Iowa City sixth grader, said she approved of Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign goal of reordering the American economy. \u201cI liked what she said,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to help people who don\u2019t have enough money.\u201d Samara and Isa Murillo, sisters who are 10 and 8 years old, each had Ms. Warren autograph a white campaign placard. Ms. Warren got down on one knee and signed them on the floor of the stage. \u201cWe love her ideas about change and the two cents,\u201d Samara said. \u201cPeople out there are dying of hunger.\u201d Isa said she was more focused on climate change. \u201cSome people don\u2019t have homes because of the flooding,\u201d she said. And, because it is Iowa, there are parents who spend caucus season vying to get their children photographed with all of the candidates they can \u2014 just in case one of them makes it to the White House. Eric Heininger, a fund-raiser for nonprofit organizations, and his wife, Tiffani Milless, a physician, toted their 9-month-old daughter, Charlotte, around the Polk County Steak Fry last month to get her in pictures with as many contenders as possible. Dressed in a red-white-and-blue sundress, Charlotte met Ms. Warren, Mr. Buttigieg, Mr. O\u2019Rourke and the entrepreneur Andrew Yang. At earlier campaign events, she was photographed with Mr. Sanders, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey and former Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado, who ended his campaign in August. With Charlotte sleeping on her father\u2019s chest, Dr. Milless filled out a card committing to caucus for Mr. O\u2019Rourke and held it up while the Texan offered his toothy smile. \u201cThank you so much,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke said, gently patting the sleeping child on her back. A campaign aide took Dr. Milless\u2019s caucus card and stuffed it into a backpack. Afterward, Dr. Milless said she had only filled out the card in order to secure the picture with her daughter. \u201cHe\u2019s in my top three,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a loose commitment, kind of like a promise ring.\u201d",

      "author": "Alexander Burns",
      "content": " With a crucial debate looming next week in the Democratic presidential primary, the party\u2019s populist wing appears increasingly in control of the race \u2014 rising in the polls, stocked with cash and with only a wounded leading candidate, Joseph R. Biden Jr., standing in its way. Several slow-building trends have converged to upend the race over the last few weeks: Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s steady ascent in the polls has accelerated. Both she and Senator Bernie Sanders, a fellow progressive, have raised immense sums of money from small donors online, dominating the Democratic field and each collecting about $10 million more than Mr. Biden in the last quarter. And Mr. Biden\u2019s numbers have gradually slipped in a way that has alarmed his supporters. The race is far from over: All three of the top candidates \u2014 Ms. Warren, Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders \u2014 have a path to victory, and there is still time for longer-shot candidates to make a real run at the nomination. The CNN/New York Times debate in Ohio on Tuesday is likely to test Ms. Warren\u2019s status as an emerging front-runner, subjecting her to new criticism from her fellow Democrats on matters ranging from health care policy to trade and the role of the government in overseeing the economy. Above all, she may need to allay lingering reservations about her appeal to swing voters in the general election. And Mr. Biden signaled on Thursday night that he will come into the debate fighting. \u201cOne of the problems I\u2019m finding, I\u2019ve got to be more aggressive,\u201d he said at a fund-raiser in Los Angeles. He then used a roundabout example to explain that debate time restraints don\u2019t allow time for lengthy answers. \u201cWhen someone says, you know, you know, \u2018Are you still beating your wife?\u2019 And, and I go, \u2018I have a long explanation,\u2019 and they say, \u2018You got 30 seconds to answer.\u2019 And you say, \u2018No. And then, wait a minute, what\u2019d I just say? No, I\u2019m not still beating my wife.\u2019 But so, I\u2019ve had, I\u2019ve had some difficulties,\u201d he said. If Tuesday\u2019s debate could break in any number of directions, what may be resolved is the overall mood of Democratic primary voters, and whether they are more inclined to seek a politically cautious nominee who promises to restore normalcy in Washington, or a more confrontational standard-bearer with an ambitious and disruptive reform agenda. It is candidates in the latter category who now control the bulk of the financial might in the race, and are best positioned in most of the early primary states. Anna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster who is not aligned in the primary, said an \u201canti-establishment\u201d current had plainly taken hold, with voters rewarding candidates for defying the conventional limits of political debate and \u201cpushing boundaries in really productive ways.\u201d She pointed not only to Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders but also to former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke, who has embraced a new political identity for himself as a gun-control activist and a critic of his own party\u2019s relatively cautious platform on the issue. \u201cAcross the board, whether it\u2019s Beto talking about assault weapons or Warren and Sanders talking about Wall Street,\u201d Ms. Greenberg said, \u201cit does feel like there is a shift in the party that is kind of new.\u201d Ms. Greenberg said there was still space for Mr. Biden to run a strong campaign because of the way voters perceive his values and character. Americans, she said, believe Mr. Biden \u201ccares about people and working class people, regular people, and that\u2019s not an insignificant asset.\u201d Yet it has been Ms. Warren, rather than Mr. Biden, who has consistently gained strength. Campaigning on a message of purging corruption in Washington and restructuring the economy, Ms. Warren has closed Mr. Biden\u2019s lead in the polls every week since the beginning of the summer and is now in a position to upset him in both Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two states to vote. Mr. Biden remains a strong contender for the nomination, largely because of the support he collects from African-American voters. But he has struggled for months to articulate a clear vision for the future and has relied heavily on Democratic nostalgia for the Obama administration. In recent weeks, he has been consumed in a grisly political clash with President Trump. So far, the support Mr. Biden has lost does not seem to have gone to another moderate, like Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. Only Ms. Warren has been moving up in the national polls, suggesting either that Mr. Biden\u2019s lost supporters have defected to her camp or that they have become undecided altogether. If Ms. Warren has become the leading liberal standard-bearer, Mr. Sanders has been a steady third in national polls and his fund-raising power is likely to keep him among the most formidable competitors in the race. Yet his campaign has been grappling with the implications of Mr. Sanders\u2019s heart attack in Las Vegas last week, a medical emergency that landed him in the hospital and has kept him off the trail for days. He has sent mixed signals about his path forward, first indicating that he would scale back his campaign schedule and then defiantly reversing that suggestion. It is unclear whether Mr. Sanders\u2019s physical condition will affect his poll numbers: He has a solid base of support nationally and few other candidates believe his core followers will be easily dislodged. There is at least a new degree of uncertainty about whether he will be in a strong position to vie for liberal Democrats who have already been migrating toward Ms. Warren. Nearly all of the candidates feel pressure to do something in the Ohio debate to stop the race from becoming a contest entirely defined by a Warren-Biden rivalry, either by inflicting direct damage on Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign or by outflanking her as an alternative to Mr. Biden. The ongoing impeachment inquiry targeting Mr. Trump has only added to the pressure on the Democratic field, since the tumult in Washington is likely to leave voters with even less time to devote to reviewing underdog options. Mr. Buttigieg in particular has been moving assertively in recent weeks to position himself as a center-left alternative to both Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren, using his considerable war chest to run television ads in Iowa. Several other candidates of different ideological stripes are counting on Iowa for a breakthrough, including Senators Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Amy Klobuchar. A wild-card joining them onstage will be a new contender, Tom Steyer, a former hedge fund investor who has spent lavishly from his personal fortune to brand himself as a reform-minded outsider. For Ms. Warren, meanwhile, the debate may help reveal whether she can consolidate her gains across the Democratic Party. On Wednesday, she campaigned in South Carolina, where she has so far struggled to gain traction with the African-American voters who largely decide the primary there. To cement her status as a front-runner, she may have to win over a range of constituencies torn between their interest in her ideas and a more cautious political calculus that draws them to Mr. Biden. One of those voters is Ohio\u2019s former governor, Ted Strickland, the only Democrat to hold that office this century. Like many Democratic voters, Mr. Strickland, a populist with close ties to organized labor, said he saw Mr. Biden as the safer bet for the general election but found it hard to resist the appeal of Ms. Warren\u2019s proposals, most of all her plan for a new tax on vast private fortunes. \u201cI think there may be something to the electability issue for Mr. Biden, in Ohio,\u201d Mr. Strickland said. \u201cBut if I could just choose to put someone in the presidency \u2014 if that was my choice alone \u2014 it would be hard for me to pass up Elizabeth Warren.\u201d Mr. Strickland said he had spoken with Mr. Biden recently and saw him as a seasoned diplomat and a reliable \u201ceconomic progressive.\u201d But Ms. Warren, he said, was gradually easing voters\u2019 reservations about her ability to go up against Mr. Trump by talking about policy issues \u201cin ways that are easily understood.\u201d Mr. Biden remains a clear favorite in just one of the early states, South Carolina, and his advisers have predicted that he would fare better in larger, more diverse states that vote later in the calendar. He is counting, in particular, on older and more moderate African-American voters to hold back the party from stampeding toward a more ideological liberal candidate. In 2016, black and Latino voters helped Hillary Clinton withstand a persistent primary challenge from Mr. Sanders. Yet scattered polling in the later states has largely followed the national trend: Last week, for instance, the Public Policy Institute of California released a poll finding a statistical three-way tie in the nation\u2019s most populous state between Mr. Biden, Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders. Mark Baldassare, president of the institute, said there was no indication in his poll that the state\u2019s diversity would represent a stumbling block for candidates on the left, as Mr. Biden is hoping. The primary debates would be crucial to determining Ms. Warren\u2019s continued momentum, he said, because voters seemed to be using them for insight into the general election. \u201cIt has become kind of a proxy for: How are these candidates going to do when they stand up next to Trump?\u201d Mr. Baldassare said. \u201cI think this will be Elizabeth Warren\u2019s moment now, because if she is in the mix for front-runner, people are going to be testing her and seeing: How does she do? How does she do when she has to be on defense?\u201d",

      "content": "  Here\u2019s our rundown of what happened in the Democratic primary this week, as the candidates gear up for Tuesday\u2019s debate in Ohio. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. explicitly endorsed impeachment on Wednesday, going beyond past statements in which he had called only for an impeachment inquiry if President Trump did not cooperate with Congress. \u201cTo preserve our Constitution, our democracy, our basic integrity, he should be impeached,\u201d Mr. Biden told supporters in New Hampshire, as he accused Mr. Trump of having \u201cbetrayed this nation.\u201d It\u2019s been a whirlwind week for Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who is recovering from a heart attack. In addition to the concerns the episode raised about his health, his campaign\u2019s delay in disclosing the heart attack led to criticism about its transparency, which Mr. Sanders has forcefully rejected. Perhaps more consequentially, Mr. Sanders told reporters on Tuesday that he would be changing the \u201cnature\u201d of his campaign by doing fewer events. On Wednesday, he said he had misspoken. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts often tells voters that after she became \u201cvisibly pregnant\u201d at the end of her first year as a public-school teacher, the principal wished her luck and hired someone else to replace her. This week, a conservative news site and other outlets challenged her account, citing a 2007 interview with Ms. Warren and minutes from a school board meeting \u2014 and Ms. Warren pushed back in a unique way. Rather than just restating the truth of her account (though she has done that as well), she called on women to share their own stories of pregnancy discrimination, which remains widespread. CNN and the Human Rights Campaign hosted the latest subject-based forum of the presidential race on Thursday, focused on gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender issues. Protesters interrupted the event at several points to call attention to the murders of black transgender women, and the candidates seemed to welcome the reminder. Before the event, Ms. Warren, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and Senator Kamala Harris of California released plans on L.G.B.T.Q. equality. All three said they would fight to pass the Equality Act and ban conversion therapy as president. This week brought a deluge of new policy proposals on issues ranging from foster care to judicial ethics. The fifth presidential debate will be held in Georgia on Wednesday, Nov. 20, and the hosts will be MSNBC and The Washington Post. As previously announced, candidates will need 165,000 donors and at least 3 percent support in four qualifying polls to make the stage. (An alternative polling option is 5 percent support in two early-state polls.) Eight candidates have met those criteria so far; the latest was Andrew Yang, who did so this past week. Ms. Warren had a crowd-pleasing comeback at the CNN town hall when asked how she would respond to a supporter who said, \u201cSenator, I\u2019m old-fashioned, and my faith teaches me that marriage is between one man and one woman.\u201d Read more about the moment here.",

Some voters and Democratic officials think he should do more.By Katie Glueck and Alexander BurnsPRINT EDITIONStakes Higher, Biden Pledges To Strike Back|October 15, 2019, Page A1",
      "author": "Katie Glueck",
      "content": "  WESTERVILLE, Ohio \u2014 In the last few days, Joseph R. Biden Jr. has unveiled a new government ethics plan and vowed that his family members would do no business overseas during a Biden presidency. His son, Hunter Biden, said he would step down from his role with a Chinese investment firm, and sat for his first television interview of the campaign. And in Iowa, the elder Mr. Biden delivered a fist-pounding diatribe against President Trump, casting him as the embodiment of public corruption. Altogether, it has added up to the most assertive attempt by Mr. Biden and his camp to extinguish questions about his son\u2019s business activities since Mr. Trump began raising them as a campaign issue, often in false or exaggerated terms. What remains to be seen is whether Mr. Biden can put those issues to rest on a far bigger stage \u2014 at the CNN/New York Times Democratic primary debate in central Ohio on Tuesday night. As fierce as Mr. Biden\u2019s efforts have been since the start of the weekend, he has in some ways raised as many questions as he has answered. If his family intends to shun foreign business in the event that he becomes president \u2014 as Hunter Biden said he would on Sunday \u2014 voters may wonder why they didn\u2019t do it far sooner, when Mr. Biden was conducting foreign diplomacy as vice president. Perhaps most of all, anxious Democratic leaders are looking to the former vice president for a sign on the debate stage that all of this is not coming too late in this campaign to make a difference \u2014 to quash the undercurrent of doubt among some Democratic strategists, activists, donors and voters that Mr. Biden is really ready for a general-election fight against a president prepared to scorch and smear his way to a second term. \u201cI\u2019m a little worried about how Joe\u2019s going to do if he were to get on a debate stage with the president, a little worried he\u2019d be able to get him rattled,\u201d said Tom Courtney, the co-chairman of the Des Moines County Democrats in Iowa, a state where the Biden campaign has made substantial investments. \u201cI would like to see him quit getting bogged down in little things. This guy has got way more experience than all the other candidates up there. He needs to take charge and show that.\u201d Mr. Biden is hardly the only candidate who faces high stakes in Tuesday\u2019s debate. Senator Bernie Sanders, 78, the oldest candidate in the race, suffered a heart attack. He now faces significant questions about his age and stamina at a moment when he consistently trails Mr. Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren in many national polls. Ms. Warren, a new front-runner, is all but certain to confront more scrutiny from other candidates onstage, which would put to the test her ability to weather sharper criticism in the national spotlight. But no one among the 12 candidates in the debate has faced as many challenges as Mr. Biden \u2014 some of them self-inflicted, and some created by a president in full attack mode, seizing on Hunter Biden\u2019s overseas business dealings in an attempt to tarnish the former vice president. After responding tentatively at first, Mr. Biden has steadily increased his counterattacks against Mr. Trump. At a news conference in Altoona, Iowa, on Sunday, Mr. Biden ferociously defended his family, tore into \u201clying President\u201d Trump and issued several oblique swipes at members of the Trump family, who have their own records of overseas business dealings. Mr. Biden himself has pledged to be more assertive in Tuesday\u2019s debate, acknowledging at a fund-raiser last week that \u201cI\u2019ve got to be more aggressive\u201d and adding, \u201cI\u2019m not complaining, I\u2019m a big boy.\u201d \u201cWhen he says, \u2018I\u2019m going to be more forceful and active on the stage,\u2019 I think he means he\u2019s not going to let people misrepresent his record, and in particular, he\u2019s going to take it to Trump because I think he\u2019s had enough,\u201d said Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware and a Biden ally. Mr. Biden enters the debate having endured perhaps the worst month of his candidacy, a period defined by his slow and halting pushback against Mr. Trump \u2014 a hesitancy some early-state Democratic voters have noticed \u2014 and a time-consuming scramble for campaign donations at the end of a less than commanding fund-raising quarter. Mr. Biden is more reliant on high-dollar fund-raisers than his leading rivals, a requirement that took him largely out of public view for days, just as Mr. Trump was amplifying his false claims about Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings overseas. Steve Snyder, a college professor from Des Moines, expressed respect for Mr. Biden as he waited for Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., to address a shivering crowd gathered outside a Des Moines high school on Saturday night. But, noting the pace of the president\u2019s broadsides against Mr. Biden, he said that the Biden campaign appeared to be \u201cslow-footing\u201d their response, even as he acknowledged the challenges of responding to Mr. Trump. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a typical campaign,\u201d said Mr. Snyder, who said he is leaning toward supporting Ms. Warren. \u201cThis is information warfare. They\u2019re just not responding quick enough.\u201d Asked to address concerns that Mr. Biden\u2019s message was getting drowned out, a view which was shared by some other Iowa voters, Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign spokesman, T.J. Ducklo, said in a statement Sunday that Mr. Biden \u201cwill continue punching back hard against Donald Trump\u2019s pathetic and increasingly unhinged behavior, while also keeping the focus on issues where Trump has failed middle class families, like rising health care costs and the urgent climate crisis.\u201d He also cited Mr. Biden\u2019s standing in recent polls, arguing that \u201cthese attacks aren\u2019t working with Democratic voters.\u201d Mr. Biden\u2019s numbers have generally remained steady at the national level since the controversy over Ukraine broke open last month. Yet Mr. Biden, who months ago held a commanding edge over his rivals, has nearly lost his lead in primary polls, having dipped well below 30 percent in The New York Times national polling average. He is barely ahead of Ms. Warren in that ranking, which gauges national support, and he is tied with her, or trailing, in three of the four early-voting states. While Mr. Biden maintains a powerful bloc of support in the race, built on the loyalty of African-American voters and moderate whites, that coalition has been shrinking rather than growing \u2014 a trend he must reverse if he is to become the nominee. Mr. Biden raised $15.2 million in the third quarter, a sturdy sum but far less than what Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren collected. He also trails Mr. Buttigieg, who has become a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre for many party donors. And Mr. Biden has declined to reveal how much money he had in the bank at the end of September, raising concerns among his supporters that he may not have the cash reserves required to defend his dwindling lead. He is legally required to disclose that figure by the end of Tuesday, a coincidence that makes the evening of the debate a moment of truth for his campaign in more ways than one. The debate, his allies acknowledge, is perhaps his best chance to reassure his supporters and regain some momentum in the race. That would likely require a feat Mr. Biden has not accomplished so far in this race: a thoroughly forceful debate performance, free of missteps or flustered responses to predictable criticism from his Democratic opponents. \u201cHe needs to figure out how he wants to handle all this Trump noise,\u201d said Jeff Link, a veteran Iowa Democratic strategist. \u201cHe\u2019s got to find a way to basically say to the audience, \u2018There\u2019s only one guy that Trump is worried about and is attacking, and let me tell you what I\u2019m going to do about it.\u2019\u201d",

But many of them, too, want to withdraw from the Middle East.By David E. SangerPRINT EDITIONTrump\u2019s Foreign Policy Draws Wide Criticism And Differing Ideas|October 16, 2019, Page A16",
      "author": "David E. Sanger",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 For nearly two decades, Republicans have dominated national security debates, portraying themselves as tough on terrorists after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and tough on a recalcitrant, disruptive Russia. On Tuesday night, Democrats sensed an opportunity to retake that ground, attacking President Trump\u2019s impulsive action in Syria as a gift to the Islamic State and to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. But it was not an easy path. Debating American foreign policy among themselves in a sustained way for the first time in the campaign, the 12 candidates on the debate stage in Ohio found themselves caught between their party\u2019s intensifying instinct to extract the United States from war and their desire to cast Mr. Trump\u2019s rapid retreat from Syria as dangerous and incompetent. In heated exchanges, the candidates were largely unified in their critique of Mr. Trump\u2019s willingness to abandon the Kurds in northern Syria; \u201cbetrayal\u201d was the most commonly used word. They drew a clear distinction between the president\u2019s impulsiveness and their own promises to maintain alliances and bring American forces home in a deliberate, orderly way. At moments, they sounded like Mr. Trump\u2019s many Republican critics in Congress, who have been equally critical of his handling of the crisis in Syria. Yet the Democrats struggled to articulate what strategy they would pursue if they inherited the carnage and disarray stemming from Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to give Turkey\u2019s leader, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, what amounted to a green light to invade his neighbor. Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to pull American troops without a backup plan put the dozen Democrats in an unusual position: It ceded to them strong-on-counterterrorism ground once largely dominated by Republicans. One by one the Democrats warned that Mr. Trump was allowing thousands of Islamic State terrorists, now breaking free from camps where they were contained by Kurdish forces in Syria, to again pose an imminent threat to the region, and ultimately to the United States. They were clearly suggesting that if a terrorist strike emanated from the region, they would blame Mr. Trump\u2019s failure to anticipate the consequences of his actions. \u201cHe has helped ISIS get another foothold, a new lease on life,\u201d Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said during what amounted to the first extensive discussion of national security in the Democratic debates so far. \u201cWe have ISIS that is going to come here,\" said her chief rival in the polls, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. But both candidates exhibited the complex straddle that Democrats are performing these days, as they try to sound tougher and more competent than Mr. Trump while also playing to their party\u2019s aversion to keeping American troops indefinitely in war zones. \u201cI think that we ought to get out of the Middle East,\u201d Ms. Warren said. She then dwelled on a description of how she would pull back differently, and more skillfully, than Mr. Trump\u2019s rapid and chaotic retreat in the past week. Mr. Biden, the only one of the candidates with a long record in foreign issues, declined \u2014 twice \u2014 to answer a question about whether he would reinsert the American troops that have been withdrawn from northern Syria. Instead, he talked about protecting the forces still in the country, saying he would give them air cover and \u201cmake it clear they\u2019re not going anywhere.\u201d He then turned to Mr. Trump\u2019s abandonment of the Kurds, America\u2019s longtime ally in fighting ISIS, shouting: \u201cThis is shameful! Shameful what this man has done.\u201d Only Mayor Pete Buttigieg of Indiana, who served in Afghanistan, made the distinction between ending large combat operations and keeping \u201ca small number of specialized, special operations forces and intelligence capabilities\u201d on the ground, especially in Syria. Those forces, he argued, \u201cwere the only thing that stood between that part of Syria\u201d and \u201cthe beginning of a genocide and the resurgence of ISIS.\u201d It is a distinction Mr. Trump, and many of those seeking to run against him on the Democratic ticket, have passed by. The exchanges on Syria, followed by a parallel discussion of how to contain Russia\u2019s increasing aggressiveness, underscored one of the oddities of the 2020 election season: Faced with a Republican president who has envisioned a far more isolationist approach to American power, the Democrats are sounding like interventionist Republicans of just a few years ago. When Mitt Romney ran against President Barack Obama in 2012, he called Russia the \u201cNo. 1 geopolitical foe\u201d facing the United States and argued that containing Mr. Putin would be his top priority. That led Mr. Obama, with a laugh, to respond: \u201cThe 1980s, they\u2019re now calling to ask for their foreign policy back,\u201d an effort to paint Mr. Romney as a cold warrior who did not realize that era had passed. Now, that Russia-focused policy is back for those hoping to reassemble Mr. Obama\u2019s coalition. In sharp contrast to Mr. Trump, who has never been openly critical of Mr. Putin, several said they would expose the Russian leader\u2019s links to corruption and freeze his bank accounts. (That was a measure briefly considered \u2014 and rejected \u2014 by Mr. Obama in late 2016, as he tried to figure out how to punish Mr. Putin as the interference in the presidential election that year became clear.) The candidates tried to outdo one another in explaining how tough they would be on Moscow. \u201cWe have not talked about what we need to do to protect ourselves from Russia invading our election,\u201d said Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. She called for the entire nation to use backup paper ballots, a step that Tom Steyer, the billionaire hedge-fund manager who gained a name \u2014 and a place on the debate stage on Tuesday night \u2014 with an expensive campaign to press for Mr. Trump\u2019s impeachment, said he \u201cabsolutely\u201d would freeze Mr. Putin\u2019s assets. But it was Syria that gave Mr. Steyer, and most of the other candidates, the opportunity they sought to present Mr. Trump as an erratic, unthinking commander in chief, incapable at looking around corners or considering the second-order effects of his actions. \u201cMr. Trump\u2019s having no plans, having no process and having no partners has proved to be a disaster in Syria,\u201d he argued. He called the president\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d approach, a slogan he adopted during the 2016 campaign, \u201c the worst idea I have ever heard and I would change it on day one.\u201d But at the same time, the candidates repeatedly struggled to explain how they would handle a problem like Mr. Erdogan, an ostensible ally who has in the past few months bought Russian air defenses and sent troops to seize territory in a neighboring state. \u201cTurkey is not a U.S. ally,\" said Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, \u201cwhen they invade another country and engage in mass slaughter.\u201d But he quickly turned the issue back to Mr. Trump, blaming him, not Mr. Erdogan, for the current crisis. \u201cYou tell me what country in the world will trust the word of the president of the United States,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. Mr. Biden came the closest to describing how he would approach the situation today, suggesting he would threaten to expel Turkey from North Atlantic Treaty Organization \u2014 a step that would be difficult to impossible under the alliance\u2019s charter \u2014 and lay out a series of steps that would force Mr. Erdogan to reverse course. But his prescription of tough talk to force a dubious ally into line sounded much like what Mr. Trump is belatedly seeking to do by sending Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the new national security adviser, Robert C. O\u2019Brien, to Turkey this week.",

      "author": "Reid J. Epstein",
      "content": "  As part of our 2020 debate coverage, we are asking political debate coaches and experts to tell us what each candidate needs to do to win, and what advice they would give those onstage. Then we will ask the experts afterward how the candidates did. KELLY The former vice president should aggressively set the record straight armed with facts and outside validators, and make clear that Trump\u2019s motivation is simple: He\u2019s scared of running against Biden and is trying to pick a different nominee. Biden should then quickly pivot back to what voters love and believe about him: that he\u2019s fighting for working families and has a record of delivering on issues like health care, while Donald Trump has failed these very same workers and families. A kitchen table contrast with Biden is deadly for Trump. O\u2019DONNELL Biden needs to answer the question of how his son got the position in Ukraine carefully, but stay on offense if he is to escape having this rub off on him more than it has. If the press drills down, and he appears weak, then others might pile on or use it to frame Biden as part of the past they\u2019re attempting to move on from. His hope has to be to keep pivoting this to impeachment. POTTER Warren has managed to win the inside track on the \u201cchange\u201d message in a primary where voters\u2019 top concern is beating Donald Trump, and this debate is a chance to tie those threads together through the lens of corruption. While a process-heavy discussion of impeachment will likely be unhelpful to her, Warren could do herself a world of good by packaging the known facts surrounding Ukraine as an easy-to-understand tale of Washington influence-peddling. FINNEY Clearly the vision Warren is campaigning on is more popular than is being given credit, but she still has to keep making the case that her ideas can win in a general election. Her strategy ought to be to continue to convince voters that she can be the commander-in-chief, steward of our economy, and that these ideas can win. DUNN Follow the old rule of show, don\u2019t tell. Senator Sanders demonstrates that he is all vim and vigor by acting that way and not talking about it. Expect him to try and act the same as he has in every previous debate. KELLY First of all, I hope that Senator Sanders is healthy and fully recovers soon. But this is a real issue. Certainly, he\u2019ll need to show energy throughout the three-hour debate and make a strong case for himself, remaining engaged throughout. But ultimately, he is 78 years old and had a heart attack. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a tactical silver bullet for the debate stage that can change those facts or demonstrate that he\u2019s healthy enough to be president of the United States. O\u2019DONNELL The November debate will be too late to have a break out moment. He has to have a moment early in this debate where he commands the stage and gets the narrative moving in his direction. The problem for him has been identity and message. He needs to find both. All the money in the world can\u2019t buy that. He also needs to have a moment where he shows competitive advantage over one of the front-runners \u2014 Warren or Biden \u2014 by taking them on over an issue where he has a real different message. He should not waste time arguing with Beto O\u2019Rourke over guns. So if he doesn\u2019t differentiate himself, he\u2019ll be on the stage for the rest of the debates, but will be out of the media conversation and out of contention. POTTER Her success depends on getting multiple opportunities to deliver sharp, simple-to-understand critiques of President Trump. Harris\u2019s greatest success on the debate stage came from creating the impression she would badly outclass Trump in a general election debate, but she has generally been unable to build on that. Her campaign\u2019s goal should be to remind voters of her unique skills in this area, perhaps on an under-addressed issue such as reproductive rights. O\u2019DONNELL His only lane is a pragmatist, more moderate approach to policy. He can never beat Warren and Sanders on their agenda, so trying to position himself more in line with Biden has to be his approach. What does that mean for the debate? He has to take on Sanders or Warren and prove that his approach is better and take on Biden and prove he would be a better president than Biden. DUNN Senator Klobuchar has already been performing very, very well \u2014 but it is not moving the needle. That\u2019s a hard position to be in. Her best bet is to draw contrast with Senator Warren and try to use Warren\u2019s momentum to build her own. KALL He should try to take credit for the impeachment inquiry since he spent so much time and money on this process. He was at the forefront of this initiative before most, but he can\u2019t let this issue singularly define his candidacy and debate talking points. FINNEY He tried to have these breakout moments at each of the debates. He ought to try to have a breakout moment that is not about attacking someone else but is about making the case that he is the right person for this moment. We still haven\u2019t seen that from him. KALL He needs to show the audience that he can do more than deliver quippy sound bites and engage in campaign giveaway gimmicks. He\u2019s been successful in directly attacking President Trump, but the debate is a good opportunity for him to soberly lay out his agenda and political philosophies more clearly. POTTER I would not be surprised to see O\u2019Rourke try to generate a sense of \u201cus-against-the-world\u201d among his supporters and decrying traditional political expectations that point toward an early exit. Beto O\u2019Rourke is best when he\u2019s in the role of the rebel with a cause and needs to leave Ohio with voters believing his voice is urgent and necessary once more. FINNEY She needs to act like a Democrat! I say this as someone who at onetime was a fan of hers years ago when she first was elected to Congress. I don\u2019t even recognize this person. Instead of whining and complaining, tell us what you are for. Don\u2019t just attack others.",

Now, back to the debate. Tuesday night\u2019s event comes at a truly extraordinary moment in American politics. In Washington, the impeachment inquiry into President Trump is moving forward at a dizzying pace. Senator Bernie Sanders is out of the hospital, former Vice President Joe Biden is out of patience and Senator Elizabeth Warren seems out to get Facebook. With a dozen candidates stuffed onstage, there are bound to be some fireworks. Here\u2019s some of what we\u2019ll be watching: On Sunday, Mr. Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden said he would step down from his board position at a Chinese investment firm. On Monday, Mr. Biden released a government ethics plan. On Tuesday, Hunter Biden will do a major television interview. Seems as if Mr. Biden and his team want to make sure he has plenty to talk about Tuesday night when it comes to his family, ethics and Mr. Trump. The challenge for Mr. Biden will be whether he can leverage the fact that Mr. Trump now faces impeachment proceedings because of the president\u2019s efforts to collect opposition research on him and his son, without getting stuck in a morass of questions about his own family. After being hospitalized for a heart attack, Mr. Sanders, 78, needs to convince voters that he is not too old to be president. The debate signifies his return to the race: He has remained off the campaign trail since Oct. 1, when he had two stents inserted to clear a blocked artery after experiencing chest pains at a campaign event. Aides to Mr. Sanders rebuffed questions asked by my colleague Sydney Ember about whether he\u2019d be able to stand so long on a stage, but they fully realize that his energy, vibrancy and ability will be under intense scrutiny from voters. Ms. Warren\u2019s surge in the polls has finally reached the point where it has become problematic for Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders. Both men have signaled that attacks could be coming, with Mr. Sanders drawing a pretty sharp contrast over the weekend. It\u2019s likely that some of those attacks will focus on her health care plan: how she would pay for it, whether she would raise taxes on the middle class, whether she would end private insurance plans and how she would accommodate union health plans. Will Ms. Warren be ready with more polished answers than she has given in the past? Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., has the most field offices in the early states (tied with Ms. Warren) and a generous campaign bank account (only Mr. Sanders has raised more among Democrats). What he lacks is actual traction in the polls. So far, most of his debate performances have been characterized by \u201cWest Wing\u201d-style monologues. But there are signs he may pivot to a more aggressive tack Tuesday night in hopes of expanding his support. In recent weeks, he has nudged Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders on health care and has been in something of a sniper fight with former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas. There have been plenty of signs that the two young guns in the race may be headed for a shootout at the Otterbein University Corral. The question is whether that will be enough for either to make a mark. Four candidates on the stage haven\u2019t qualified for the next debate in November: the former housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Mr. O\u2019Rourke. Tuesday night is a now-or-never moment for them. Expect some fireworks \u2014 or at least an attempt to light a fuse. For Mr. Steyer, it\u2019s his first time in a primary debate. He\u2019s an actual billionaire standing onstage at a time when several candidates have built populist campaigns running against the billionaires. But he\u2019s also one of the most progressive candidates in the field on issues like climate change and impeachment. As for Ms. Gabbard, her campaign has emerged as one of the biggest mysteries of the 2020 race. After threatening last week to boycott the debate, she is now planning to appear. She could attack the entire political class, the Democratic Party and the media. Or not! No one quite knows what to expect from either one of these iconoclastic competitors.

Our National editor, Marc Lacey, has held a lot of the biggest jobs at The New York Times: White House correspondent, a foreign correspondent who has reported from dozens of countries and the editor of the weekend news report. Now, he is about to take on perhaps his highest-profile task yet \u2014 moderating the Democratic primary debate. We had some questions about that. Marc was kind enough to give us some answers. But, sadly, not the questions. So, a dozen candidates on the stage, a nonstop flood of Big Breaking News out of Washington. How do you prepare for this kind of debate, in this particularly extraordinary moment in American politics? There are a lot of candidates, no doubt about it. And so many critical issues to ask about. This debate could go on until the sun comes up. But we\u2019ve had to cull the many things we could ask into one meaty debate in one evening. How important is it to ask about what\u2019s happening with the administration versus what\u2019s happening in Democratic policy circles? Put another way, what\u2019s the balancing act between asking about President Trump and, say, health care policy? I can\u2019t get into the questions. I\u2019ve been sworn to secrecy. You\u2019re a print guy about to enter a TV world. Is that nerve-racking? I\u2019ve been in the hotel gym a couple of times a day to remain calm. I can already do more pull-ups than James Comey has set as his goal. How much do you take into account what happened at past debates when making your plan of attack for this one? I\u2019ve watched every previous debate and every candidates\u2019 forum from this election season. That\u2019s hours and hours of preparation. I know you can\u2019t tell us the questions. But, seriously, can you tell us the questions? Any hints, at least? There will be questions, many questions, and they will be substantive questions. Does that answer your question? Any pre-debate rituals? This is my very first debate, so I have no ritual. I\u2019m open to suggestions. And I\u2019m not certain yet how I will nourish myself immediately beforehand. There\u2019s this great taco joint a couple of blocks from my hotel, though. Uh, don\u2019t think we\u2019re talking about quite the same Saints. Were you forwarded this newsletter?

      "author": "Matt Flegenheimer",
      "content": "  WESTERVILLE, Ohio \u2014 Senator Elizabeth Warren looked down, performatively taken aback. She raised her hand to speak \u2014 surely it was her turn again. She shrugged a little. For about an hour on Tuesday, Ms. Warren had been the prime target of her debate rivals, compelled to defend as never before the hard-charging progressivism and soak-the-rich economic approach that has elevated her to the top of the polls. Beto O\u2019Rourke, the former Texas congressman, had a theory about all of that. \u201cSometimes, I think Senator Warren is more focused on being punitive or pitting some part of the country against the other,\u201d he said, using a question about the wealth tax to lash Ms. Warren\u2019s broader political philosophy, \u201cinstead of lifting people up and making sure this country comes together.\u201d Ms. Warren turned to Mr. O\u2019Rourke, then back to the cameras. \u201cSo, um, I\u2019m really shocked at the notion that anyone thinks I\u2019m punitive,\u201d she said. Perhaps. But she should not have been surprised. For months, Ms. Warren had moved largely unimpeded in her brisk jog to the front of the 2020 Democratic pack, coasting through debates without incident as her calls for \u201cbig structural change\u201d took hold and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. absorbed the unforgiving glare afforded the favorite. Time and again this year, moderators had invited Ms. Warren\u2019s top competitors to attack her. Time and again, they had done so gently, if at all. This time, Mr. O\u2019Rourke went after her. Pete Buttigieg, the millennial mayor of South Bend, Ind., did the same early in the evening in a slashing exchange on health care. Andrew Yang said she was wrong on the wealth tax. Senator Kamala Harris smiled as she and Ms. Warren sparred over whether to regulate President Trump\u2019s tweets. Mr. Biden initiated his most direct debate-stage confrontation with Ms. Warren to date, saying she was \u201cbeing vague\u201d in campaign proposals. This was Ms. Warren\u2019s reward for achieving co-front-runner (and maybe outright front-runner) status: persistent sniping from fellow Democrats who see her surge as the most urgent threat to their own paths to the nomination. Ms. Warren greeted the deluge with mixed success, never wobbling too precariously but retreating at times to the safe harbor of stump-speech platitudes. On occasion, she appeared so eager to avoid the fray that she could give the impression that she was not engaging with the substance. \u201cA yes-or-no question that didn\u2019t get a yes-or-no answer,\u201d Mr. Buttigieg observed at one point. The fresh antipathy was all the more striking for its contrast with the treatment of two fellow contenders whose campaigns have been consumed by drama of late. Shortly after his recent heart attack, Senator Bernie Sanders attracted little meaningful criticism, on policy matters or his health. He will receive a boost this weekend with the expected endorsement of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the New York congresswoman who has emerged as an impassioned gatekeeper of the left. And Mr. Biden, straining to keep his grip on the race, survived an early dissection of the impeachment inquiry that centers on Mr. Trump\u2019s urging of the Ukrainian president to investigate Mr. Biden and his son Hunter. While the candidates plainly saw little incentive in questioning whether Hunter Biden had traded on the family name in dealings abroad \u2014 lest they be seen as doing the president\u2019s bidding \u2014 their deference itself was damning: Other campaigns have long expected Mr. Biden to falter on his own, viewing Ms. Warren as the more nettlesome long-term headache, and the former vice president\u2019s performance on Tuesday quite likely did little to alter their calculation. The moment that Mr. Biden had prepared for came early. Asked about his son in the debate\u2019s opening minutes, Mr. Biden worked to summon the righteous fury and stern statesman\u2019s gaze perfected over his half-century in public life. \u201cMy son did nothing wrong,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cI did nothing wrong.\u201d At times, his delivery was wobbly, as it tends to be. He stopped and started a bit. He cited George Washington. But he worked toward the conclusion he has been repeating often on the campaign trail. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want me to be the candidate,\u201d Mr. Biden said of the president. \u201cHe is going after me because he knows if I get the nomination, I will beat him like a drum.\u201d Before the debate, several rivals had come to Mr. Biden\u2019s defense, plainly mindful of the limits and potential downsides of condemning peers so far this year \u2014 and of condemning Mr. Biden on this subject in particular. None made an issue of Mr. Biden\u2019s family on Tuesday. At the previous three debates, Mr. Biden had been the focus of attacks both glancing and sharply personal. Yet the candidates who have gone after Mr. Biden frontally \u2014 including Ms. Harris; Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former federal housing secretary; and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, who has left the race \u2014 have seen few lasting benefits. In some cases, such as Mr. Castro\u2019s, the effort appeared to backfire with some Democratic voters and officials who are eager to keep the focus on Mr. Trump. Taking on Ms. Warren brought risks of its own, given her popularity with the party\u2019s base and the scant evidence throughout this primary that voters are inclined to reward infighting of any sort. But less than four months before the Iowa caucuses, her competitors have determined that complacency will not suffice. Mr. Buttigieg was the first aggressor, a few minutes into the debate in Westerville. He had been asked about Ms. Warren\u2019s support for Medicare for All and her squishy responses to the question of whether middle-class taxes would rise under it. This was the candidate with \u201ca plan for everything,\u201d Mr. Buttigieg taunted, \u201cexcept this.\u201d Ms. Warren\u2019s head shot skyward. \u201cWe can pay for this,\u201d she insisted, repeating that \u201ccosts\u201d would rise only for the wealthy and declining to concede \u2014 as Mr. Sanders, her comrade-in-health-care-policy, has \u2014 that middle-class taxes would go up. Amy Klobuchar, a moderate Senate peer who has leveled few attacks from the stage all year, was having none of it. \u201cAt least Bernie\u2019s being honest here,\u201d she said. The debate, the fourth of the campaign, came during a period of momentum for Ms. Warren, who has moved into a lead position, topping Mr. Biden in some surveys both nationally and in early-voting primary states. At the previous debate, Mr. Biden quickly abandoned mannerly efforts to draw contrasts with her, and other high-polling rivals had until Tuesday largely refrained from issuing piercing criticism onstage. But in the lead-up to the debate, several contenders had telegraphed arguments against Ms. Warren. At a fund-raiser last week, Mr. Biden made an oblique jab, saying that to claim that Medicare for All is achievable without a significant increase of taxes \u201cnot just for the wealthy but across the board is just not honest.\u201d And on Tuesday morning, Mr. Buttigieg released a digital ad that swiped at Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders over their support for Medicare for All, a sweeping single-payer plan that would all but eliminate private health insurance. The two leading candidates had avoided flashes of explosive confrontation with each other until around the final half-hour of the debate, when Mr. Biden said, \u201cI\u2019m the only one who has gotten anything really big done,\u201d criticizing Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders for advocating overly general ideas on issues like health care. Ms. Warren went on to point to her role in helping to create the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau during the Obama administration. \u201cI agreed with the great job she did,\u201d Mr. Biden said. Turning to face Ms. Warren, jabbing his hand in her direction, the former vice president\u2019s voice rose. \u201cAnd I went out on the floor and got you votes. I got votes for that bill. I convinced people to vote for it. So let\u2019s get those things straight, too.\u201d Some in the room applauded. \u201cI am deeply grateful to President Obama,\u201d she said pointedly \u2014 as his vice president grinned \u2014 \u201cwho fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law, and I am deeply grateful to every single person who fought for it and who helped pass it into law.\u201d \u201cYou did a hell of a job at your job,\u201d Mr. Biden said, interrupting her. Less clear was Mr. Biden\u2019s appraisal of Ms. Warren in her new role: the co-favorite.",

      "content": " COLUMBUS, Ohio \u2014 As Tuesday night\u2019s Democratic debate approached, members of the Young Democratic Socialists of America chapter at Ohio State University tried to figure out where to focus their energy. At a meeting on campus last week designed to set their goals for the year, they talked about labor organizing, volunteering for Morgan Harper\u2019s congressional campaign and hosting a town hall-style event focused on climate change. \u201cIt\u2019s all related, even though they look like separate issues, \u201d said Daija Kidd, an African-American studies and sociology double major and co-chair of the Y.D.S.A. chapter, as she tried to get the other members to think about new campaigns for the year. \u201cWe have these very specific events that we go to, like the climate strike,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I want to do something that is ongoing, because that is the purpose of democratic socialists. I don\u2019t want us to finish doing one big thing and have that be it \u2014 I want to keep it chugging along.\u201d The group\u2019s effort to take on an aggressive and expansive agenda reflects the enormous energy on the far left heading into the 2020 election, and part of the appeal of democratic socialism in this cycle: setting an array of big goals to help deepen a movement that goes beyond one-off protest events and marches. For many young, progressive Americans, democratic socialism is a far better representation of their ambitions of far-reaching structural change across the economy and society than the agenda of the Democratic Party, which they see as overly influenced by corporate interests, big-money donors and moderate traditionalists. The attempt at Ohio State to define objectives also comes as the Democratic presidential contenders are locked in a battle over what direction the party should take in order to win in 2020. That dynamic will be on display Tuesday night less than 15 miles from O.S.U., when the candidates gather for the fourth primary debate at Otterbein University in Westerville. Two top candidates, Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, have successfully pushed the primary conversation to the left. The D.S.A. saw drastic growth in its membership when Mr. Sanders, himself a democratic socialist, ran for president in 2016, and there are now nearly 60,000 members across the country. (Ms. Warren, who has pulled ahead of Mr. Sanders in polling and is a leading candidate for the nomination, backs many of the same progressive priorities as Mr. Sanders, but has also said she is \u201ca capitalist to my bones.\u201d) The national leaders of the Young Democratic Socialists of America have seized on Mr. Sanders\u2019s momentum with younger voters to expand their group\u2019s membership, too, growing from 25 registered chapters in 2016 to 84 in 2019, according to a Y.D.S.A organizer. Chapters have begun to spring up at high schools, as well. The chapter at O.S.U. was small for the past two years, with only 10 or 11 active members. Still, the group managed to create a campus campaign around Fight for $15, an effort to raise the minimum wage of university staff members to $15 an hour. They won that battle in August. Now, each meeting draws 40 to 50 members, each one with a different reason for joining and something unique to fight for. For many of them, Mr. Sanders was their introduction to the left. They see the D.S.A. as more than just a vehicle to advance the rights of workers \u2014 it is also a home for progressive policies and issues that they don\u2019t see being addressed by the major political parties in a way they agree with. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re totally abandoning capitalism per se, but certainly they\u2019re more likely to embrace policies tied to what we characterize as socialism,\u201d said Melissa Deckman, chair of the political science department at Washington College in Chestertown, Md., who is working on a book about the political engagement of Generation Z. \u201cThey\u2019re interested in free college tuition or in expanding health care.\u201d As they grew up in the wake of a recession and watched the effects of climate change unfold, the Black Lives Matter movement form and gay marriage be legalized, the students were often just a click away from finding the next progressive policy to support. Nathan Webster, a second-year electrical engineering major at Ohio State, learned about the Democratic Socialists of America through protests in his hometown, Painesville, Ohio, aimed at abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement. \u201cI come from a largely Latino town \u2014 some of my friends lost their parents to Border Patrol,\u201d Mr. Webster said. \u201cNear the end of high school, I realized what politics were and where I fall on the political spectrum,\u201d he added. \u201cOriginally I told myself, \u2018O.K., I\u2019m a Democrat,\u2019 because I didn\u2019t know any better. I didn\u2019t know that there was something that could be more left.\u201d For Ricky Vehar, an environmental engineering major, coming out as gay and then coming out as trans moved her closer to the Young Democratic Socialists of America. \u201cFrom my background, you wouldn\u2019t really expect me to become super left. I grew up in a middle-class family, in a good suburb,\u201d she said, adding that watching \u201cthe discrimination that those communities face not just because they\u2019re gay or trans, but because the system incentivizes discrimination against them, moved me toward the left.\u201d James Fisher, a second-year student and a co-chair of the O.S.U. chapter, joined the group for similar reasons: they support giving trans teenagers and adults better access to health care through Medicare for All. \u201cMedicare for All can benefit the trans community in their ability to get good health care, and that\u2019s something that a lot of trans people struggle with,\u201d Mx. Fisher said. \u201cIt\u2019s embedded in the language of Medicare for All, that there\u2019s no exclusionary measures to it.\u201d Others joined the Y.D.S.A. because they saw the benefits of nationalized health care firsthand. During a yearlong program in England, Johnny Amundson got very sick and was hospitalized for a month. His program enrolled him in the National Health Service, and he ended up paying just $200 in medical fees, he said. \u201cI saw that there\u2019s a difference between being able to have insurance, which my family has, and being able to have health care,\u201d Mr. Amundson said. He is now a fourth-year journalism and Russian double major at Ohio State, and he was one of the first members of the university\u2019s Young Democratic Socialists of America chapter. Nikki Velamakanni, a political science major, joined Y.D.S.A. when she realized that she didn\u2019t want to join the College Democrats chapter on campus because of the stigma around it. \u201cIt\u2019s known to be more centrist, it\u2019s known to be more compromise-y,\u201d Ms. Velamakanni said. \u201cWhereas the left is more, \u2018We stand for this and we\u2019re going to fight for it.\u2019\u201d Dr. Deckman attributes the rise of the Y.D.S.A. to the changing perceptions that younger voters and soon-to-be voters have about government and democratic socialism, and the idea that younger people tend to be more liberal with each passing generation. \u201cThey\u2019re more willing to have a bigger role for government to play in our lives,\u201d she said. \u201cThis younger generation is growing up seeing what deregulation is doing to the Earth, is doing to their ability to afford college, among other things. I think that\u2019s why they\u2019re finding democratic socialist ideas appealing.\u201d Some of their parents were introduced to socialism during the Cold War, giving the word an entirely different meaning. \u201cOlder Americans who lived during the Cold War, they link socialism strongly to communism. So there\u2019s this idea that if we raise socialism, our freedoms, especially religion, are going to be compromised,\u201d Dr. Deckman said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think that sort of baggage matters to younger Americans.\u201d For Evan Schmidt, a second-year economics major, \u201csocialism is a word only. It doesn\u2019t necessarily have a direct correlation to any sort of regime or empire, which allows for that reconstruction around it.\u201d He grew up in Manchester, Vt., where the idea of democratic socialism was less taboo thanks to Mr. Sanders. When he moved away, out of what he describes as a \u201csheltered neighborhood,\u201d he had his first experiences with people who grew up with less than he did. It ignited his passion for democratizing the workplace and helping others to achieve the same class mobility his family enjoyed. He joined the Young Democratic Socialists of America, he said, because he thinks \u201cit\u2019s what the Democratic Party should be.\u201d",

      "content": "  WESTERVILLE, Ohio \u2014 Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts faced a sustained barrage of criticism from her Democratic rivals at a presidential debate in Ohio on Tuesday, tangling with a group of underdog moderates who assailed her liberal economic proposals, while former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. appeared to fade from the fray after parrying President Trump\u2019s attacks on his family. The debate confirmed that the primary race had entered a new phase, defined by Ms. Warren\u2019s apparent strength and the increasing willingness of other Democrats to challenge her. She has risen toward the top of the polls while confronting limited resistance from her opponents, and in past debates she attracted a fraction of the hostility that Democrats trained on Mr. Biden. That changed in a dramatic fashion on Tuesday, when a group of her rivals voiced sharp skepticism of Ms. Warren\u2019s agenda or accused her of taking impractical stances on issues like health care and taxation. Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., insistently charged Ms. Warren with evading a \u201cyes-or-no\u201d question on how she would pay for a \u201cMedicare for all\u201d health care system, while Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota cast parts of Ms. Warren\u2019s platform as a \u201cpipe dream.\u201d Former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas branded Ms. Warren\u2019s worldview as overly \u201cpunitive.\u201d Ms. Warren sought at every turn to dispense with her critics by casting them as lacking ambition or political grit. When she addressed criticism of her proposal to tax vast private fortunes, for instance, Ms. Warren suggested her opponents believed it was \u201cmore important to protect billionaires than it is to invest in an entire generation\u201d but did not single out her rivals. The debate unfolded in a drastically altered political landscape, with Mr. Trump facing impeachment and Mr. Biden in the center of a firestorm over his son\u2019s  overseas financial dealings. The candidates were prompted to cover a wide range of issues, including a number that had featured little or not at all in past debates \u2014 not just the impeachment of Mr. Trump, but the Turkish invasion of Syria, and the details of gun control policy and the taxation of great wealth. The moderators began with a series of questions about impeachment to each of the 12 candidates \u2014 the largest field ever for a primary debate \u2014 affording them an opportunity to denounce Mr. Trump. And Mr. Biden was quickly asked about his son Hunter Biden\u2019s overseas financial work, delivering a narrow, repetitive answer in which he said neither he nor his son had done anything wrong. Foreign policy played a greater role on Tuesday evening than in any other debate, pushed to the political foreground by the renewed outbreak of war and humanitarian catastrophe in Syria. The Democrats chiefly trained their attention on Mr. Trump\u2019s role in instigating the crisis there: For instance, Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former housing secretary, condemned Mr. Trump for \u201ccaging kids on the border and letting ISIS prisoners run free\u201d in Syria. With Mr. Biden a diminished force, Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Klobuchar appeared determined to present themselves as strong alternatives for voters in the middle. Both emphasized their Midwestern credentials, and Mr. Buttigieg invoked his experience as a military veteran in several wide-ranging answers on foreign policy. Their new aggressiveness represented a shorter-term calculation about halting Ms. Warren\u2019s increasing strength in Iowa. With Ms. Warren gaining there, Ms. Klobuchar and Mr. Buttigieg plainly decided to target her in an effort to appeal to the state\u2019s moderate voters, who so far have lined up with Mr. Biden. With a powerfully funded campaign and an expanding field operation in Iowa, Mr. Buttigieg may be uniquely well positioned to assert himself there. In an intense argument that reflected their changing fortunes in the race, Mr. Biden briefly went on the offensive against Ms. Warren toward the end of the debate, describing her health care plans as \u201cvague\u201d and demanding in a raised voice that she give him some credit for her signature accomplishment, the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau after the 2008 financial crisis. Ms. Warren expressed gratitude for the help she had received \u2014 not from Mr. Biden but from former President Barack Obama. But Ms. Warren was on the defensive for much of the evening and most of all on the issue of single-payer health care, when she again declined to specify precisely how she would fund a sweeping system of government-backed insurance. Unlike Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Ms. Warren has not acknowledged in plain terms that a \u201cMedicare for all\u201d plan would quite likely have to substitute broad-based taxes for private insurance premiums and other costs. \u201cI will not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle-class families,\u201d Ms. Warren said, declining to elaborate. Ms. Klobuchar, in her most assertive debate performance yet, chided Ms. Warren for not explaining to voters \u201cwhere we\u2019re going to send the invoice\u201d for single-payer care. \u201cAt least Bernie\u2019s being honest here,\u201d Ms. Klobuchar said. Ms. Warren was squeezed, at times, from the left as well: While Mr. Sanders never broke their informal nonaggression pact, he agreed with several of the moderates that it was \u201cappropriate\u201d to enumerate the financial trade-offs involved in single-payer health care, including taxes on Americans that would be \u201csubstantially less than what they were paying for premiums and out-of-pocket expenses.\u201d And while Mr. Sanders, who had a heart attack this month, was forced to address new concerns about his health, his campaign aides confirmed during the debate that he had secured an endorsement from Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York that could inject new energy into his candidacy. But there were also the germs of a broader discussion of the role of the United States in the Middle East: In an intense exchange between the two military veterans onstage, Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii said that it was not only Mr. Trump who had \u201cthe blood of the Kurds on his hands,\u201d but also politicians in both parties and news media organizations that had cheered for \u201cregime change war.\u201d Her remarks drew forceful pushback from Mr. Buttigieg, who said Ms. Gabbard was \u201cdead wrong,\u201d arguing that \u201cthe slaughter going on in Syria is not a consequence of American presence \u2014 it is a consequence of a withdrawal and a betrayal by this president of American allies and American values.\u201d While Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren did not clash directly over foreign policy, they diverged in a stark fashion over the situation in Syria. Mr. Biden said he would want to keep American troops there and convey to the Turkish government that it would pay a \u201cheavy price\u201d for its invasion. Ms. Warren said she opposed Mr. Trump\u2019s handling of the situation but believed the United States should \u201cget out of the Middle East.\u201d (Aides to Ms. Warren said she was referring to the withdrawal of troops from combat.) Throughout the debate, which was sponsored by CNN and The New York Times, Mr. Biden played a far less central role than he did in the past, stepping to the foreground for exchanges over foreign policy but otherwise taking a more passive approach. His most important moment of the night may have come early on, when he was pressed by a moderator to explain why his son had not crossed any ethical lines by doing business in Ukraine while his father was overseeing diplomacy there for the Obama administration. Mr. Biden said several times that he and his son had done \u201cnothing wrong,\u201d and alluded repeatedly to an interview Hunter Biden gave to ABC News, in which he said it had been an error in judgment to sit on the board of a Ukrainian gas company while the elder Mr. Biden was vice president. Mr. Trump has accused the Bidens of corruption, often in false or exaggerated terms, and his efforts to enlist the government of Ukraine in tarring Mr. Biden instigated an impeachment inquiry. \u201cThis is about Trump\u2019s corruption,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we should be focusing on.\u201d None of Mr. Biden\u2019s Democratic rivals chose to press the subject, reflecting both the political sensitivity of issues touching on Mr. Biden\u2019s family and also a calculation, by his most immediate rivals, that Mr. Biden is likely to continue sinking in the race without a further onslaught from fellow Democrats. While a number of candidates are hoping to peel away moderate voters from Mr. Biden, they tried to do so on Tuesday by challenging the left rather than by blasting the leading candidate of the center. Defending his political stature, Mr. Biden at one point described himself as \u201cthe only one on this stage who has gotten anything really big done,\u201d and cited his work on the Violence Against Women Act and the Obama administration\u2019s health care law. That argument drew a fierce response from Mr. Sanders, who said Mr. Biden had also achieved far less laudable feats, like the passage of the NAFTA trade deal and a law tightening the federal bankruptcy code. \u201cYou got the disastrous war in Iraq done,\u201d Mr. Sanders added. And Ms. Warren, too, took issue with Mr. Biden\u2019s claim, pointing to her role as the architect of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau \u2014 an agency, she said, that represented \u201cstructural change in our economy.\u201d In a moment of crackling tension, Mr. Biden raised his voice and urged Ms. Warren to give him credit, too, for the birth of the agency. \u201cI went onto the floor and got you votes,\u201d he said. Ms. Warren retorted by saying she was \u201cdeeply grateful for President Obama, who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law,\u201d as well as for others in the administration who did the same. Just as striking as the offensives by Ms. Klobuchar and Mr. Buttigieg were the more passive showings by Senators Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris \u2014 both of whom were counting on a strong outing. Mr. Booker repeatedly said the focus of the debate should be on Mr. Trump. He denounced the moderators\u2019 questions about Mr. Biden\u2019s son. \u201cThe only person sitting at home enjoying that was Donald Trump,\u201d Mr. Booker said. And he even defended the fitness of the septuagenarian candidates onstage \u2014 Mr. Biden, Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren \u2014 by noting that Mr. Trump would be the least healthy candidate running in 2020. Ms. Harris also mostly trained her fire on the president, at one point using her new catch line: \u201cDude gotta go.\u201d The only moment when Ms. Harris showed any appetite for tangling with the other candidates was when she demanded to know why Ms. Warren would not join her in urging Twitter to remove the president\u2019s account. Ms. Harris seemed more focused on trying to build support with women, as she spoke most forcefully about the importance of defending abortion rights. \u201cIt is her body, it is her right, it is her decision,\u201d she said. After presenting her message at the previous three debates with only intermittent challenges from her rivals, Ms. Warren was met with cutting criticism of her signature populist flourishes. \u201cI want to give a reality check to Elizabeth,\u201d said Ms. Klobuchar, before alluding to another candidate onstage, the hedge fund executive Tom Steyer. \u201cNo one on this stage wants to protect billionaires. Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires. We just have different approaches.\u201d Mr. Buttigieg was just as pointed, repeatedly casting Ms. Warren as a \u201cWashington politician,\u201d but he and Ms. Klobuchar were not alone. Even lagging candidates such as Mr. O\u2019Rourke and Andrew Yang, a former tech entrepreneur, took on Ms. Warren, all but confirming her front-runner status. And while she was eager to articulate her progressive vision here, Ms. Warren seemed just as cognizant that she must broaden her coalition beyond her core base of upscale liberal whites. She repeatedly cited her support for adding funding to historically black colleges and mentioned her brothers, who still live in her native Oklahoma and two of whom are Republicans. Mr. Sanders was not as ubiquitous a presence as he had been at past debates, but he drew applause by pre-empting a question about his health. \u201cI\u2019m healthy, I\u2019m feeling great,\u201d he said before vowing \u201ca vigorous campaign.\u201d That, Mr. Sanders said, \u201cis how I think I can reassure the American people.\u201d",

      "author": "Neil Vigdor",
      "content": " It was an unusual juxtaposition for Democrats \u2014 calling a Republican president weak militarily. That\u2019s how the contenders for the party\u2019s nomination framed the recent withdrawal of American troops from northern Syria under President Trump, who they said during Tuesday night\u2019s debate had created turmoil with his impulsive foreign policy decision making. \u201cIt\u2019s been the most shameful thing any president has done in modern history in terms of foreign policy,\u201d former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said. While Democrats have been consumed with the Trump administration\u2019s dealings with Russia and Ukraine, the emerging foreign policy crisis in Syria presented a delicate test for the party\u2019s presidential hopefuls on the debate stage. It followed Mr. Trump\u2019s decision this month to withdraw American troops from northern Syria, one that has been sharply criticized by Republicans and now Democrats, who said it would endanger Kurdish allies in the region. Mr. Trump said he was trying to \u201cend the endless wars.\u201d Mr. Biden, a former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, called the move a betrayal and said it would throw Syria into chaos and embolden Islamic State militants. The issue appeared to give Mr. Biden an opening to burnish his foreign policy credentials and contrast himself with his main rivals, Senator Elizabeth Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders. \u201cThey lost their lives,\u201d Mr. Biden said of the Kurds. \u201cThis is shameful.\u201d Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., who served as an intelligence officer in the United States Navy Reserve and was deployed to Afghanistan, admonished Mr. Trump over the withdrawal. \u201cWhat we were doing in Syria was keeping our word,\u201d Mr. Buttigieg said. \u201cPart of what makes it possible for the United States to get people to put their lives on the line to back us up is the idea that we will back them up, too.\u201d \u201cWhen I was deployed, not just the Afghan national army forces but the janitors put their lives on the line just by working with U.S. forces,\u201d he continued. \u201cI would have a hard time today looking an Afghan civilian or soldier in the eye after what just happened over there.\u201d Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders both assailed Mr. Trump\u2019s abrupt withdrawal declaration, but both have long opposed American intervention in the conflict. \u201cSo, look, I think we ought to get out of the Middle East,\u201d Ms. Warren said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should have troops in the Middle East, but we have to do it the right way, the smart way.\u201d Mr. Sanders said Mr. Trump\u2019s credibility was completely undermined. \u201cNow you tell me what country in the world will trust the word of the president of the United States?\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cIn other words, what he has done is wreck our ability to do foreign policy, to do military policy, because nobody in the world will believe this pathological liar.\u201d And then there was Representative Tulsi Gabbard, whom Senator Kamala Harris had called an apologist for Syria\u2019s president, Bashar al-Assad. In 2017, Ms. Gabbard visited Mr. Assad, whose government used chemical weapons against rebels during a May 2018 attack in Syria\u2019s civil war, the United States concluded. Ms. Gabbard, who was deployed to Iraq, criticized the presence of American troops in Syria and the Trump administration\u2019s handling of their withdrawal, both of which she said contributed to the killing of Kurds by Turkish-backed forces. \u201cFirst of all, we\u2019ve got to understand the reality of the situation there, which is that the slaughter of the Kurds being done by Turkey is yet another negative consequence of the regime change war we\u2019ve been waging in Syria,\u201d Ms. Gabbard said. Despite the shared military service of Ms. Gabbard and Mr. Buttigieg, the two veterans split over whether to keep American troops in Syria. Mr. Buttigieg said that Ms. Gabbard was \u201cdead wrong,\u201d and that the slaughter was not caused by the presence of American troops but by the abrupt withdrawal of troops by the Trump administration. Ms. Gabbard responded: Mr. Buttigieg said Ms. Gabbard had aligned herself with the Trump administration on the issue. \u201cYou can put an end to endless war without embracing Donald Trump\u2019s policy, as you\u2019re doing,\u201d Mr. Buttigieg said. Ms. Gabbard said Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s stance didn\u2019t make sense. \u201cWhat is an endless war if it\u2019s not a regime change war?\u201d Ms. Gabbard said.",

      "author": "Shane Goldmacher",
      "content": "   The Democratic field has lined up squarely behind Joseph R. Biden Jr. over President Trump\u2019s baseless allegations that, as vice president, Mr. Biden acted improperly to benefit his son\u2019s overseas business interests. But for many of Mr. Biden\u2019s rivals, the tougher question has been whether they think his son, Hunter Biden, should have been working for foreign interests while his father was vice president. On Sunday, the lawyer for the younger Mr. Biden said he was stepping down from the board of a Chinese company and would refrain from working for \u201cforeign-owned companies\u201d if his father was elected president. And in an interview with ABC News released this morning, Hunter Biden shared more of his side of the story, saying that while he showed \u201cpoor judgment\u201d in accepting the board position, Mr. Trump\u2019s accusations of wrongdoing were \u201cridiculous.\u201d How Mr. Biden handles questions about his son will be closely watched, as will how the rest of the field balances addressing Hunter Biden\u2019s work with denouncing Mr. Trump. Since his heart attack two weeks ago in Las Vegas and the insertion of two stents to clear a blocked artery, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has been off the campaign trail recovering, mostly at his home in Burlington, Vt. While Mr. Sanders, 78, has sat for interviews, spoken to press on the street outside his home and recorded videos, the debate will be his biggest event since his heart attack. While most of the candidates have political objectives on Tuesday, Mr. Sanders has a different kind of hurdle to clear, as his former adviser Mark Longabaugh told our colleague Sydney Ember. \u201cI think he has only one objective in this debate, and that\u2019s just to show that he\u2019s healthy,\u201d Mr. Longabaugh said. Mr. Sanders said last week the medical episode would \u201cchange the nature\u201d of his campaign, which has been among the most punishing in the field. \u201cWe were doing, you know, in some cases five or six meetings a day, three or four rallies and town meetings and meeting with groups of people,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to do that.\u201d But Mr. Sanders quickly said that he had been misinterpreted and that his candidacy will continue full steam ahead. The first and biggest test will be how he performs at the debate. For weeks now, as she\u2019s cemented herself as a fellow front-runner alongside Mr. Biden, the word has been that Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts would see more sustained scrutiny from her fellow candidates. It hasn\u2019t quite happened yet. But this may be beginning to change. Without naming Ms. Warren, Mr. Biden last week, called her health care plan \u201cdishonest.\u201d Mr. Sanders contrasted himself with Ms. Warren by saying she is \u201ca capitalist through her bones,\u201d while he is not. So far, Ms. Warren has been extremely lucky as a presidential candidate. At each moment when the heat on her has turned up, something happened to dial it down. Last month when Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and others, including the late-night host Stephen Colbert, criticized her for refusing to say whether the middle class would pay for her health care proposal, attention quickly shifted to Mr. Trump\u2019s conduct on a call with the Ukrainian president. When Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign made the embarrassing revelation that it fired a senior staffer who faced sexual harassment allegations, the Sanders campaign moments later announced that the Vermont senator had suffered a heart attack. Polls of early-state voters show that Ms. Warren is the most popular Democratic presidential candidate, but that\u2019s in part because no other candidate has taken a shot at her. If none do on Tuesday, it will be another month before their next best chance to do so. After three debates that each began with in-the-weeds discussions about health care policy, Tuesday\u2019s face-off in Ohio comes in the midst of an impeachment inquiry of Mr. Trump and after a weekend of cataclysmic fallout after Mr. Trump abruptly changed United States policy in Syria. The debate is the first opportunity for the 12 candidates onstage \u2014 who have each endorsed impeaching Mr. Trump \u2014 to demonstrate contrasting visions of how they would address the president. While each of the Democratic candidates have condemned Mr. Trump\u2019s action and conduct in the White House, they all realize there is danger in placing opposition to him at the center of their campaigns. Democratic primary voters loathe the president, but on the campaign trail few ask the candidates to respond to the latest outrage of the day \u2014 let alone the foreign policy legacy of the Iraq war. Voters, the candidates know by now, want to know the specifics about how their platforms will make their lives better, what policies they will seek to implement as president and, perhaps most of all, how they can win a general election. While the candidates are onstage, their bookkeepers will be busy with an entirely different event: formally disclosing how much their campaigns raised and spent in July, August and September. Almost all the candidates \u2014 besides Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former housing secretary, and Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii \u2014 have announced how much they have raised, with Mr. Sanders pacing the field with $25.3 million. But the top lines are hardly the only interesting element of the disclosures. While Mr. Sanders, Ms. Warren and Senator Kamala Harris of California have all disclosed how much cash they will have on hand heading into the final quarter of 2019, Mr. Biden notably did not. The general rule of thumb for such things is that campaigns release good news early and hold bad news for as long as possible. (Former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas did not disclose his dismal $3.6 million second-quarter haul until hours before the previous deadline, for instance.) That bodes ill for Mr. Castro\u2019s financial state of affairs and Mr. Biden\u2019s cash-on-hand.",

      "author": "Maggie Astor",
      "content": " [Watch the debate and follow our live analysis here.] As Tuesday\u2019s Democratic debate in Ohio turned to the subject of income inequality, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont fielded a question on his past comments on billionaires. His response \u2014 in which he did not explicitly answer the question of whether his goal was \u201cto tax billionaires out of existence,\u201d but forcefully defended his plans to tax them much more heavily \u2014 prompted a lengthy exchange with Tom Steyer, himself a billionaire; former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.; and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who was the first to propose a wealth tax this year. Here is a transcript of the exchange: ERIN BURNETT, moderator: Income inequality is growing in the United States at an alarming rate. The top 1 percent now own more of this nation\u2019s wealth than the bottom 90 percent combined. Senator Sanders, when you introduced your wealth tax, which would tax the assets of the wealthiest Americans, you said, quoting you, Senator: \u201cBillionaires should not exist.\u201d Is the goal of your plan to tax billionaires out of existence? SANDERS: When you have a half a million Americans sleeping out on the street today, when you have 87 million people uninsured or underinsured, when you have hundreds of thousands of kids who cannot afford to go to college and millions struggling with the oppressive burden of student debt, and then you also have three people owning more wealth than the bottom half of American society, that is a moral and economic outrage. And the truth is, we cannot afford to continue this level of income and wealth inequality, and we cannot afford a billionaire class whose greed and corruption has been at war with the working families of this country for 45 years. So if you are asking me, do I think we should demand that the wealthiest top one-tenth of 1 percent start paying their fair share of taxes so we can create a nation and a government that works for all of us, yes, that\u2019s exactly what I believe. BURNETT: Thank you, Senator. Mr. Steyer, you are the lone billionaire on this stage. What\u2019s your plan for closing the income gap? STEYER: First of all, let me say this. Senator Sanders is right. There have been 40 years where corporations have bought this government, and those 40 years have meant a 40-year attack on the rights of working people and specifically on organized labor. And the results are as shameful as Senator Sanders says, both in terms of assets and in terms of income. It\u2019s absolutely wrong. It\u2019s absolutely undemocratic and unfair. I was one of the first people on this stage to propose a wealth tax. I would undo every Republican tax cut for rich people and major corporations. But there\u2019s something else going on here that is absolutely shameful, and that\u2019s the way the money gets split up in terms of earnings. As a result of taking away the rights of working people and organized labor, people haven\u2019t had a raise \u2014 90 percent of Americans have not had a raise for 40 years. If you took the minimum wage from 1980 and just adjusted it for inflation, you get 11 bucks. It\u2019s seven and a quarter. If you included productivity gains of American workers, it would be over 20 bucks. There\u2019s something wrong here. And that is that the corporations have bought our government. Our government has failed. That\u2019s why I\u2019m running for president. Because we\u2019re not going to get any of the policies that everybody on this stage wants \u2014 health care, education, Green New Deal or a living wage \u2014 unless we break the power of these corporations. BURNETT: Thank you, Mr. Steyer. Vice President Biden, you have warned against demonizing rich people. Do you believe that Senator Sanders and Senator Warren\u2019s wealth tax plans do that? BIDEN: No, look. Demonizing wealth \u2014 what I talked about is how you get things done. And the way to get things done is take a look at the tax code right now. The idea \u2014 we have to start rewarding work, not just wealth. I would raise the capital gains tax to the highest rate of 39.5 percent. I would double it. Because guess what? Why in God\u2019s name should someone who is clipping coupons in the stock market pay a lower tax rate than someone who in fact is, like I said \u2014 a schoolteacher and a firefighter? It\u2019s ridiculous, and they pay a lower tax. Secondly, the idea that we, in fact, engage in this notion that there are \u2014 there\u2019s $1.64 trillion in tax loopholes. You can\u2019t justify at minimum $600 billion of that. We could eliminate it all. I could go into detail had I the time. Secondly \u2014 thirdly \u2014 what we need to do is we need to go out and make it clear to the American people that we are going to raise taxes on the wealthy. We are going to reduce tax burdens on those who are not. This is one of the reasons why these debates are kind of crazy. Because everybody tries to squeeze everything into every answer that is given. The fact is, everybody is right about the fact that the fourth industrial revolution is costing jobs. It is. The fact is also corporate greed, if they\u2019re going back and not investing in their employees, they\u2019re reinvesting in buying back their stock. BURNETT: Thank you, Mr. Vice President. Senator Warren, your response. WARREN: So, I think this is about our values as a country. Show me your budget, show me your tax plans, and we\u2019ll know what your values are. And right now in America, the top one-tenth of 1 percent have so much wealth, understand this: That if we put a 2 cent tax on their 50 millionth and first dollar and on every dollar after that, we would have enough money to provide universal child care for every baby in this country age 0 to 5; universal pre-K for every child; raise the wages for every child care worker and preschool teacher in America; provide for universal tuition-free college; put $50 billion into historically black colleges and universities; and cancel student loan debt for 95 percent of the people who have it. My question is not why do Bernie and I support a wealth tax, it\u2019s why is it \u2014 does everyone else on this stage think it is more important to protect billionaires than it is to invest in an entire generation of Americans?",

      "author": "Maggie Astor",
      "content": "  We here on The New York Times Politics desk had a busy and exciting week helping to host the fourth Democratic debate. Tuesday night was especially frenetic, with the debate, third-quarter fund-raising reports and a pair of major endorsements all in the news. As always, we\u2019re here to step back and sort it all out for you. Here\u2019s a rundown of the major moments of the week. Thanks to her newfound front-runner status, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts was everyone\u2019s target on Tuesday night. She fielded criticism on her proposed wealth tax, on the cost of \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d and on her decision not to urge Twitter to suspend President Trump\u2019s account. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, appearing at his first event since his heart attack two weeks earlier, seemed like his old self and aimed to dispel some of the concerns about his health. And Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota had big nights, sparring with Ms. Warren and setting themselves up as moderate voters\u2019 alternatives to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr, who largely faded into the background. Tuesday was the deadline for candidates to file their third-quarter reports with the Federal Election Commission. Our colleagues compiled the fund-raising totals, analyzed how they compared to previous quarters, and created a graphic that shows who\u2019s up and who\u2019s down in the money race. The candidates also provided a few surprising top lines: Mr. Biden is relatively low on cash; about half the field spent more money in the third quarter than they took in; and Tom Steyer, a billionaire former hedge fund manager who is largely self-financing his campaign, spent $47 million in the past months. But the real oddity was on the other end of the spectrum. Mayor Wayne Messam of Miramar, Fla., reported raising a grand total of five (5) dollars from July through September. As the three-hour debate was winding down on Tuesday, word came that Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a progressive political star from New York, was planning to endorse Mr. Sanders at a rally this weekend. Representative Ilhan Omar, a Minnesota Democrat, soon gave her support to Mr. Sanders, too, scoring him a highly coveted endorsement two weeks after his heart attack. Both women are among the first-term Democratic women of color known as \u201cthe squad.\u201d The other two members of the group, Representatives Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ayanna S. Pressley of Massachusetts, have not made a presidential endorsement. In a speech on Thursday at Georgetown University, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, argued forcefully against the idea that the social network should be an arbiter of speech, doubling down on a stance that has drawn wide condemnation as the company continues to face accusations of amplifying disinformation. Ms. Warren renewed that criticism after Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s speech, saying late Thursday in a tweet: \u201cFacebook is actively helping Trump spread lies and misinformation. Facebook already helped elect Donald Trump once. They might do it again \u2014 and profit off of it.\u201d The comments continued an increasingly public feud between Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Warren. Earlier this month, Ms. Warren bought a political ad on Facebook that purposefully included the false claim that Mr. Zuckerberg and Facebook backed Mr. Trump\u2019s re-election \u2014 and essentially dared the social network to remove it. (Neither Mr. Zuckerberg nor Facebook has endorsed a candidate.) Mr. Zuckerberg at one point invoked the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to make his point about free speech, which drew a response from one of Dr. King\u2019s daughters, Bernice King. \u201cI\u2019d like to help Facebook better understand the challenges #MLK faced from disinformation campaigns launched by politicians,\u201d she wrote on Twitter. \u201cThese campaigns created an atmosphere for his assassination.\u201d On Tuesday, Ms. Warren also announced that she would not take any contributions over $200 from executives at big tech companies, big banks, private equity firms or hedge funds. Several Democrats released policy proposals this week, many of which echoed ideas from their rivals. We leave you with this photo of Mr. Steyer and his tie. Your humble hosts are not experts in neckwear, but lucky for you, Vanessa Friedman \u2014 The Times\u2019s fashion director and chief fashion critic \u2014 actually is. She has written a piece containing everything you ever wanted to know about the tie, its Twitter account(s), Mr. Steyer\u2019s penchant for tartan and, well, you get the idea. This is a rabbit hole. We welcome you down it.",

His campaign canceled his events and said he would be resting for several days.By Sydney Ember and Jonathan MartinPRINT EDITIONHeart Trouble Pulls Sanders From the Trail|October 3, 2019, Page A1",
      "author": "Sydney Ember",
      "content": "  Senator Bernie Sanders was recovering in a Las Vegas hospital on Wednesday after being treated for blockage of an artery, forcing him to cancel his events in the coming days and casting uncertainty over a candidacy already struggling to win new voters. Mr. Sanders, 78, experienced \u201csome chest discomfort\u201d at an event Tuesday night, said Jeff Weaver, a longtime adviser; a medical evaluation found blockage in one artery, and two stents were inserted. Mr. Sanders\u2019s hospitalization is likely to intensify the focus on age in the Democratic race, even as much of the public debate has centered on policies like health care and immigration. The three leading Democratic candidates, as well as the president they are vying to challenge, are all in their 70s. One of those Democrats, Joseph R. Biden Jr., 76, has drawn his own age-related scrutiny because of his sometimes rambling discourses and uneven answers in debates. Campaign aides did not provide any further information about Mr. Sanders\u2019s condition and they have not said whether he had suffered a heart attack or whether he was just experiencing chest pain. Late Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Sanders posted a tweet thanking his well wishers and using the incident as an opportunity to plug his signature policy proposal, \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d Inserting stents into arteries is common in the United States \u2014 there are at least 600,000 such procedures a year, and perhaps up to one million. It is usually uncomplicated, and patients return home within a day or two. \u201cThe prognosis is very good,\u201d said Dr. Steven Nissen, chief academic officer of the Heart and Vascular Institute at the Cleveland Clinic. \u201cMost patients are home the next day and back to work very quickly.\u201d He said he did not see it as an impediment to returning to the campaign trail. Still, it is unclear when Mr. Sanders will return to the campaign trail or whether he will be able to participate in the next Democratic debate, on Oct. 15 in Westerville, Ohio, near Columbus. [Have you or your loved ones had experience with stents? We want to hear how it may have affected your life and work. Please share your story in the comments.] Mr. Sanders\u2019s heart issue could prove to be a political problem for him, and it has the potential to change the dynamic of a still-fluid Democratic race. Mr. Sanders has largely avoided scrutiny of his age and his health. But he and his rivals will now be under increasing pressure to release detailed medical records as Democratic voters try to settle on the best candidate to take on President Trump, who is himself 73. Mr. Sanders, Mr. Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is 70, have all said they would release their records before the first voting starts in February. When Mr. Sanders returns to the campaign, he may find what was already his biggest challenge \u2014 finding new converts to his mission \u2014 to be even more difficult. \u201cI do think this makes it harder for him to persuade new supporters to come into his column because this will at least be in the back of people\u2019s minds,\u201d said Erik Smith, a longtime Democratic strategist. The setback with his health also comes amid something of a political slump for Mr. Sanders in his second run for the presidency. He has continued to raise substantial amounts of money from his dedicated supporters \u2014 on Tuesday, his campaign celebrated an impressive third-quarter fund-raising haul of $25.3 million \u2014 and has remained among the top three contenders in the primary. But he has been unable to expand his base beyond those enthusiasts. In recent weeks, he shook up his staff in Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two nominating states, in an effort to jump-start his candidacy as Ms. Warren passed him in some polls. Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign Wednesday said he began experiencing chest pain during a campaign event on Tuesday night in Las Vegas, where he had traveled for a series of appearances. He had visited an outdoor memorial dedicated to victims of the city\u2019s 2017 mass shooting and had hosted a grass-roots fund-raiser at the Shiraz restaurant. The restaurant\u2019s owner, Raja Majid, said in a phone interview Wednesday that Mr. Sanders had spoken to a crowd of about 250 people. As Mr. Sanders began taking questions from the audience, he asked a staff member for a chair, an unusual request from a candidate who typically stands or paces onstage. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long day here,\u201d he said. On Wednesday, Mr. Weaver spoke only in general terms about Mr. Sanders\u2019s prognosis. \u201cSenator Sanders is conversing and in good spirits,\u201d he said in the statement. \u201cHe will be resting up over the next few days. We are canceling his events and appearances until further notice, and we will continue to provide appropriate updates.\u201d Mr. Sanders was to travel to California and Iowa later this week.  Mr. Sanders\u2019s allies quickly downplayed his procedure. RoseAnn DeMoro, a former leader of a nurse\u2019s union and longtime Sanders surrogate, said \u201cthere are numerous presidents who have had heart problems and heart problems far worse\u201d than what Mr. Sanders experienced Wednesday. Yet many Democratic voters have expressed discomfort with nominating a candidate in their 70s. A Pew survey in May indicated that only 3 percent of Democratic voters believed the best age range for a president to be in was in their 70s. Forty-seven percent of those surveyed said they preferred a president in their 50s. \u201cI\u2019m not an ageist, and I never have been, but as I get older I realize the limitations of getting older, and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine the strain of being president of the United States,\u201d said Steve Horner, 68, a retired special education teacher from Las Vegas who travels with a portable oxygen unit to help him breathe. \u201cI think it does matter,\u201d added Mr. Horner, who said he had not picked a candidate yet. Others acknowledged that age was an issue, but not the pre-eminent one. \u201cWould I prefer someone who is younger? Yes, but it\u2019s not our top thing,\u201d Elizabeth Bennett, 54, said at a gun safety forum in Las Vegas. On the campaign trail, each of the three septuagenarian Democrats has sought to project an image of good health, with Ms. Warren making a point to jog to the stage of her campaign events and Mr. Biden running through parades. The onetime captain of his high school track team, Mr. Sanders has done the same. He has pursued a blistering campaign schedule often characterized by multiple stops a day, and has been loath to take time off from the trail. He pitched in the softball game his campaign staged over the summer on Iowa\u2019s \u201cField of Dreams,\u201d and his aides have released other images of him playing catch or basketball. Mr. Sanders\u2019s events are usually high-energy affairs, where he regales enthusiastic crowds with his calls for \u201cMedicare for all\u201d and rails against the corporate and Washington elite. In recent weeks, he has struggled with hoarseness, which forced him to cancel several events last month, but he then returned to the campaign trail. In March, he hit his head on the edge of a glass shower door, requiring seven stitches. The Sanders campaign had planned to go on air with his first television ads of the campaign this week in Iowa, announcing a two-week $1.3 million buy on Tuesday. His campaign said on Wednesday that it was postponing those ads. The procedure Mr. Sanders had is generally not considered dangerous. Stents are tiny metal tube-shaped cages used to widen arteries in which blood flow has become impeded. They are inserted into coronary arteries when patients are suffering from angina, which is pain that results from clogged vessels, or heart attacks, in which blood flow is completely blocked. Dr. Gilbert Tang, a heart surgeon at the Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, said that if Mr. Sanders\u2019s heart was not damaged, he should make a full recovery. But he also sounded a note of caution, saying the risks depended on which artery was blocked: \u201cWe don\u2019t know what the anatomy looks like and what kind of stent at what location,\u201d he said. During his first presidential run, Mr. Sanders released a letter from his doctor declaring that he was in \u201cvery good health.\u201d The letter stated that Mr. Sanders had suffered several ailments during his life, including gout and diverticulitis. The letter also said Mr. Sanders had normal readings for blood pressure, pulse and blood count and that he had no history of cardiovascular disease.",

      "author": "Sydney Ember",
      "content": " Senator Bernie Sanders, recovering in a Las Vegas hospital from a procedure to treat a clogged artery, should be able to return home by the end of this weekend and will participate in the next Democratic debate, his wife, Jane Sanders, said Thursday. \u201cBernie is up and about,\u201d Ms. Sanders said in a statement on Thursday. \u201cWe expect Bernie will be discharged and on a plane back to Burlington before the end of the weekend.\u201d Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign has declined to say whether he had suffered a heart attack, and his wife\u2019s statement did not address that. On Wednesday, Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign said he experienced \u201csome chest discomfort\u201d during an event on Tuesday evening; a medical evaluation found blockage in one artery, and two stents were inserted. He has canceled a two-day college tour this week in California, and his aides have not said when he would return to the campaign trail. Placing stents in arteries is a common procedure, and patients generally return home within a day or two. Ms. Sanders did not specify whether Mr. Sanders, 78, would be discharged sooner than the weekend and would remain in Las Vegas before returning home. Dr. Brahmajee Nallamothu, an interventional cardiologist at the University of Michigan, said it is hard to read too much into Mr. Sanders\u2019s apparently prolonged hospital stay. If a blood vessel\u2019s anatomy is complex, he said, cardiologists might keep a patient for an extra day. But a stay of several days, he said, \u201cis not typical unless there is an additional issue.\u201d Dr. Nallamothu said he had watched a video of Mr. Sanders\u2019s event at a Las Vegas restaurant Tuesday night when the senator, looking distressed, removed his jacket and asked for a chair so he could sit down. The symptoms, Dr. Nallamothu said, suggest that Mr. Sanders might have had a small heart attack \u2014 defined as a blockage that results in some damage to the heart muscle \u2014 or almost had a small heart attack. But he does not seem to have had a major one. With a smaller heart attack, a blood vessel is mostly blocked but a trickle of blood can still get through. If the person is sitting still, that can be enough blood to relieve symptoms. But if the person is standing and moving around \u2014 as Mr. Sanders was originally\u2014 the paucity of blood can cause chest pain and discomfort. In her statement, Ms. Sanders, who traveled on Wednesday to Las Vegas and is now with Mr. Sanders as he recovers, said her husband was in a buoyant mood, that doctors were \u201cpleased\u201d with Mr. Sanders\u2019s progress and that he had not needed any additional procedures. Former Senator Harry Reid of Nevada visited Mr. Sanders on Thursday at Desert Springs Hospital Medical Center. In a brief phone interview, Mr. Reid said Mr. Sanders \u201clooked really good.\u201d He said Mr. Sanders had been sitting in a big chair but \u201cjumped right up\u201d when he arrived and that the two spoke for about a half-hour, on topics including health care and his grandson, who works for Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign as a videographer. With Mr. Sanders were his wife; Faiz Shakir, his campaign manager; and Ari Rabin-Havt, a deputy campaign manager, he said. \u201cBernie is not a backslapping joke teller; he\u2019s a very serious man always,\u201d Mr. Reid said. \u201cHe feels good, he smiled.\u201d Internally, the campaign is trying to keep its staff motivated. Two advisers, Nina Turner and Jeff Weaver, led an all-staff conference call on Thursday, a campaign aide said, that appeared aimed at energizing the staff. \u201cWe are not taking our foot off the gas,\u201d Ms. Turner said. Still, the incident is likely to intensify the focus on Mr. Sanders\u2019s age, but also on age generally in the Democratic race, where the three top candidates \u2014 Mr. Sanders, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Elizabeth Warren \u2014 are all in their 70s. But if allies are projecting optimism about his ability to return to the race in full form, the medical episode has cast a shadow over his candidacy just as he was trying to reinvigorate his campaign and prepare for the next debate on Oct. 15. In recent weeks, he has tried to improve his standing in the race by overtly stressing his electability \u2014 an attempt to draw a contrast to Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren, who has continued to surge. On Tuesday, the Sanders campaign trumpeted its $25.3 million third-quarter fund-raising haul as it looked to put its summer woes behind it. Mr. Sanders\u2019s heart trouble, however, could complicate his argument that he is the best positioned to defeat President Trump in the general election. On Wednesday, his campaign said he was postponing a highly-touted $1.3 million television ad buy in Iowa. In an update on Thursday, the campaign said that it would begin airing the ad on Tuesday, and that it would run for two weeks as it had planned. The Sanders campaign\u2019s reluctance to provide much information about his health has also not helped to quell concern. Rebecca Katz, a progressive strategist who is not aligned with any candidate this cycle, said the Sanders campaign should be in \u201crapid response mode and giving out as many answers about Sanders\u2019s health as possible before more questions pile up.\u201d \u201cIf everything is fine,\u201d she said, \u201cThe campaign should be operating as normal.\u201d Since Wednesday, campaign aides have been trying to put the episode in a positive light, with some tweeting and retweeting well-wishes and encouragement. Surrogates and supporters have also expressed their solidarity. Some supporters have leveraged the episode into a rallying cry for fund-raising. Mr. Sanders himself sent out a tweet on Wednesday thanking his well-wishers and using the opportunity to plug \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d The tweet prompted some allies to praise him for being so devoted to his message. The campaign said several surrogates would visit Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina this weekend.",

      "author": "Sydney Ember",
      "content": " Senator Bernie Sanders raised $25.3 million in the past three months, his campaign said on Tuesday, a total that continues to demonstrate his strength with small donors as he fights to maintain support in key early-voting states. The financial haul, among the first that a candidate has announced for the third quarter, will place Mr. Sanders in the top tier of the field for fund-raising. It is also a much-needed boost for his campaign, as it looks to move past a summer slump that coincided with staff shake-ups in New Hampshire and Iowa and a slip in some polls in early-voting states. And it will perhaps help quell the narrative that his campaign is in decline. Mr. Sanders received 1.4 million donations in the third quarter, his campaign said. His third-quarter dollar total exceeds the $18 million he raised in the second quarter, which was roughly the same amount he collected during the first six weeks of his campaign at the beginning of the year. His campaign did not say how much cash it had on hand. Mr. Sanders announced his total for the quarter just minutes after Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., said he had raised $19.1 million in the same period. The fund-raising announcement comes as Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign begins a crucial phase of his presidential bid. He and his advisers had tried for months to portray the race as a battle between Mr. Sanders and Joseph R. Biden Jr., but the surge of Ms. Warren, his chief ideological rival, has scrambled that strategy. The top tier of candidates in the field has narrowed faster than his advisers expected, complicating matters: Rather than competing for the nomination with a half dozen candidates, he is essentially battling just two right now \u2014 Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren. Seeking to alter the course of the race, Mr. Sanders has shifted his message in recent weeks to focus more on electability. During a recent tour of eastern Iowa and campaign stops elsewhere, he has tried to make the case to voters that of all the Democratic hopefuls, he is the candidate most likely to prevail against President Trump. He has also introduced a series of audacious policy proposals, including establishing a national rent control standard, eliminating existing medical debt and instituting a wealth tax that goes farther than Ms. Warren\u2019s plan. Yet perhaps more than ever, Mr. Sanders is betting on the grass-roots appeal that propelled his 2016 campaign, a factor that his campaign says polls often fail to capture. Rather than relying on high-dollar fund-raisers \u2014 events he categorically rejects \u2014 he instead hopes to energize enthusiastic supporters who can donate to him again and again. In a show of force last month, his campaign said it had logged contributions from more than one million individual donors. His campaign said the average donation for the quarter was $18.07. His strategy means he does not have to worry about donors maxing out; his campaign said more than 99.9 percent can give again. But it also poses challenges: Though he has a loyal army of supporters and volunteers, many of them do not donate large amounts of money, meaning he must appeal to a huge pool of donors in order to keep pace with rivals like Mr. Buttigieg, who is willing to collect large sums of money on the traditional big donor fund-raising circuit.",

      "author": "Matt Stevens",
      "content": "  Just over three months before Iowans caucus for Democratic presidential candidates, four polls out this week present a muddled picture of a primary race that is unfolding in varying, and sometimes conflicting, ways nationally and in early-voting states. A pair of new national polls present starkly different results. A CNN survey released Wednesday had former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. with a commanding lead of 15 percentage points ahead of Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. But a Quinnipiac University poll released Thursday had Ms. Warren as the front-runner, seven points ahead of Mr. Biden. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont finished a strong third in both national polls, suggesting that his standing in the race has not been diminished by his heart attack earlier this month \u2014 and that he may have been buoyed by endorsements from Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota. Two other polls from early-voting states show a tight race in Iowa and Mr. Biden maintaining a comfortable lead in South Carolina. Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., continued to show particular strength in Iowa, earning third place and 13 percent support in the Suffolk University/USA Today poll of Iowa Democrats released on Monday. Senator Kamala Harris of California, who is now staking her campaign on a top-three finish there, was in a four-way tie for fifth in that poll with 3 percent support. It is not clear why the CNN and Quinnipiac polls present such divergent results for Ms. Warren and Mr. Biden. But the polls, both considered to be of high quality and able to help candidates qualify for the next Democratic debate, add data points to a divide that has emerged in recent weeks: between surveys that show Mr. Biden with a commanding lead, and those that have him in a statistical dead heat with Ms. Warren. A number of things can affect a poll\u2019s results, including the wording of a horse-race question and the order that items are asked. In CNN and Fox News polls\u00a0this year, respondents have typically been asked for their opinions on each of the Democratic presidential candidates, among other questions, before being queried about their vote preference. In Quinnipiac\u2019s polls \u2014\u00a0as well as those conducted by Monmouth University, which have also shown Ms. Warren climbing steadily \u2014 people have not typically been asked to evaluate the candidates one-by-one before giving their vote choice. If such small differences in survey structure are indeed having an effect on results, it may reflect the fact that many respondents are not yet certain about their feelings. The CNN poll released this week brought that point home, finding that a majority of Democratic voters who favored one candidate \u2014 53 percent \u2014 said they could still change their mind about whom to support for the nomination. \u201cIt makes me think that voters are not settled, that they\u2019re still shopping for a candidate \u2014 that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing some movement between polls,\u201d Doug Schwartz, Quinnipiac\u2019s polling director, said Thursday in a telephone interview. The Quinnipiac poll also qualified Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota for the debate next month in Georgia, making her the ninth candidate to do so. Candidates must meet a donor requirement set by the Democratic National Committee as well as a polling requirement; Ms. Klobuchar, who is getting a second look after a strong performance in the October debate, received 3 percent support in the Quinnipiac survey and two others this week, giving her a total of four qualifying polls and securing her spot in the debate next month. National polls can offer a snapshot of the Democratic electorate\u2019s mood, and the extent to which a candidate\u2019s debate performance has helped or hurt a campaign. The Quinnipiac poll, which had a margin of error of five percentage points, said Ms. Warren had registered 28 percent support compared with 21 percent for Mr. Biden. Mr. Biden\u2019s support in the survey was down six points from a similar national poll that Quinnipiac released 10 days earlier and was conducted before the October debate; Ms. Warren\u2019s support was around the same in that poll. Support for Mr. Sanders rose slightly in the post-debate poll, to 15 percent, while Mr. Buttigieg remained in fourth place with 10 percent. The CNN poll, which had a margin of error of four percentage points, put Mr. Biden\u2019s support at 34 percent and Ms. Warren\u2019s at 19 percent. It seemed to add credibility to the results coming out of Fox News and other polling operations, which have consistently shown Mr. Biden alone at the front of the Democratic pack. Members of CNN\u2019s polling team declined to comment about the results of their latest survey. At the state level, the Suffolk University/USA Today poll of Iowa Democrats showed Mr. Biden in the lead with 18 percent support, Ms. Warren just behind him with 17 percent, Mr. Buttigieg next with 13 percent and Mr. Sanders finishing fourth with just 9 percent support. The outcome of Iowa voters\u2019 caucus in February could influence South Carolina voters, who go to the polls about four weeks later. Throughout the primary, Mr. Biden has held on to a steady and sizable lead in the polls there. The Monmouth University poll out of South Carolina this week showed his support there dipping to 33 percent this month from 39 percent in July, but Ms. Warren still finished a distant second with 16 percent support. Mark Blumenthal, an independent pollster who has advised Democratic candidates, pointed out that turnout in presidential primaries and caucuses is generally quite low \u2014 sometimes under 1 percent in some state contests. For this reason, the results of any survey that polls all registered Democratic voters nationwide is bound to capture many people who will not in fact participate. \u201cThe big challenge of polling in any election is measuring a population that doesn\u2019t yet exist,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. That is true of \u201cpresidential primaries in particular \u2014 because they\u2019re a small fraction of the larger population and because they\u2019re these very high-profile events where the composition can change dramatically from election to election.\u201d \u201cOdds are good,\u201d Mr. Blumenthal added, \u201cthese results will converge as we get closer to voting.\u201d",

      "author": "Sydney Ember",
      "content": " Senator Bernie Sanders had a heart attack this week, his presidential campaign said on Friday as he left a Las Vegas hospital, following three days of near silence from the candidate and his advisers about his health. Mr. Sanders, 78, had entered the hospital on Tuesday night after experiencing chest pain at a campaign event, and doctors had inserted two stents in a blocked artery, a relatively common procedure. But the campaign did not confirm that Mr. Sanders had had a heart attack until Friday, inviting questions about his condition, and his campaign\u2019s transparency, as he remained off the campaign trail this week. Television cameras filmed Mr. Sanders as he left the hospital Friday, waving to onlookers and pumping a fist, then driving off in a sport utility vehicle. He will remain in Las Vegas on Friday night and return to his home in Burlington, Vt., on Saturday, campaign officials said. \u201cAfter two and a half days in the hospital, I feel great, and after taking a short time off, I look forward to getting back to work,\u201d Mr. Sanders said in a statement. While much of the conversation in the Democratic race has centered on issues like health care and student debt, Mr. Sanders\u2019s heart attack is likely to heighten scrutiny on age in a primary where the top candidates are all in their 70s. In addition to Mr. Sanders, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is 76 and Senator Elizabeth Warren is 70. President Trump is 73. But if Mr. Sanders has, until this week, largely avoided questions about his health \u2014 he has projected an image of fitness as a candidate and has maintained a blistering schedule on the campaign trail \u2014 the spotlight is now squarely on him. The ages of the current leaders notwithstanding, many Democratic voters have expressed discomfort with nominating a septuagenarian candidate, a notion that some political strategists say Mr. Sanders\u2019s heart attack is unlikely to dispel. \u201cRunning for president is a physical and emotional trial, and the presidency itself is even more demanding,\u201d said David Axelrod, a former top adviser to President Barack Obama. \u201cWhile we all wish Senator Sanders well, this has to be a big flashing light for him. And given his age, it may be for some voters, as well.\u201d Mr. Sanders began experiencing chest discomfort on Tuesday evening during a grass-roots fund-raiser he was hosting at a Las Vegas restaurant. As he began taking questions from the audience, he asked a campaign aide for a chair. He did not stay much longer at the event, and became visibly uncomfortable in a car afterward, according to two campaign officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive topic. At that point, Mr. Sanders was taken to an urgent care facility, where doctors determined that he should be transferred to a hospital. He was then taken by ambulance to Desert Springs Hospital Medical Center. At the hospital, he was taken immediately to the cardiac catheterization laboratory, where doctors inserted two stents into a blocked artery. By Wednesday, he was talking to his campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, about the campaign. By Thursday, he was walking laps around the hospital hallway, the officials said. His doctors in Las Vegas, Arturo E. Marchand Jr. and Arjun Gururaj, said in a statement that Mr. Sanders\u2019s \u201chospital course was uneventful with good expected progress.\u201d He spent three nights at the hospital and canceled his events and appearances for the week. The campaign released little information during the week about the extent of Mr. Sanders\u2019s heart trouble, fueling speculation about his health. But on Thursday the campaign said he would participate in the next Democratic debate, to be held near Columbus, Ohio, on Oct. 15. A heart attack means that a portion of the heart muscle died, starved of blood when a vessel was blocked, Dr. Gilbert Tang, a heart surgeon at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, said. \u201cThe first question is, how serious was the heart attack? What muscle was damaged and how will that affect the heart\u2019s function?\u201d Dr. Tang said. \u201cIf it was a significant portion of the heart, will that affect the heart\u2019s ability to pump?\u201d If only a small portion of heart muscle was damaged, he added, Mr. Sanders should make a full recovery \u2014 even at 78. These days recovery does not depend on age so much as other medical issues, like lung problems, he said. That does not mean that Mr. Sanders can simply continue as if nothing happened, though. Doctors usually recommend a cardiac rehabilitation program, which is essentially an exercise program in which patients are closely monitored. Such a program, Dr. Tang said, \u201cconditions the heart to work harder.\u201d Mr. Sanders would normally also take a cocktail of drugs to reduce his risk of another heart attack, including powerful anti-clotting medications that require close monitoring for a month, Dr. Tang said. In the 2016 presidential campaign, Mr. Sanders\u2019s doctor said that the senator was \u201cin overall very good health.\u201d His ailments included gout; a mild elevation of cholesterol; an inflammation of out-pouches in the bowel known as diverticulitis; and hormone replacement therapy for an underactive thyroid gland. He had no reported history of heart disease. Among the other candidates, Mr. Biden underwent emergency surgery in 1988 for a near-fatal ruptured berry aneurysm of an artery in his brain. He also underwent surgery to remove a second berry aneurysm. In 2008, Mr. Biden\u2019s doctor said that he had recovered fully. Mr. Trump has not had a medical emergency while running for or serving in office, though he has not released as much medical information to the public as other recent presidents have. This year, the White House physician pronounced Mr. Trump in \u201cvery good health,\u201d although the president had gained weight and is now officially obese. Other presidents and presidential candidates have had heart trouble, though not all of it was known to the public at the time. Experts believe that President Warren G. Harding died of a heart attack that his doctor did not detect. Toward the end of President Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s third term and until his death in his fourth term, his White House doctor withheld the fact that he had serious heart failure. President Dwight D. Eisenhower suffered a heart attack near the end of his first term, and might have had a heart attack before he ran for president. In 1999, former Senator Bill Bradley damaged his presidential campaign by not disclosing that he had had a number of episodes of atrial fibrillation, a heart rhythm abnormality, before he experienced one while campaigning and had to be rushed to a hospital with reporters trailing him. Before his heart attack pulled him from the campaign trail, Mr. Sanders was polling in the top tier of the Democratic primary race with Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren, and his staff has been trying to project optimism about his candidacy. But the episode has cast a shadow over his campaign just as he was attempting to reinvigorate it after a summer slump that saw his standing in some polls slip. Hoping to reverse course, he had recently begun to focus more on his electability, arguing that he is the candidate best positioned to beat Mr. Trump in the general election. The Sanders campaign announced this week that it had raised $25.3 million in the third quarter, placing him ahead of Ms. Warren, his chief ideological rival, by a hair and at the top of the field in fund-raising. In a show of force, the campaign announced a $1.3 million ad buy in Iowa that it then postponed as it waited to assess the situation; the ad will now begin airing next Tuesday, and will run for two weeks as planned. Campaign officials said they would determine when he would return to the trail as he recovers at his home, and it was possible that his first public appearance would be at the debate. His demeanor then will likely be watched closely by both voters and the news media. Already, Mr. Sanders is working against a built-in bias. When asked about age, voters show a clear preference for younger presidential candidates, with an overwhelming majority saying they prefer candidates in their 40s through 60s, according to surveys. When asked about the ideal age for a president, just 3 percent said the 70s, according to polling released by Pew Research Center in May. Other polls have shown that Americans express more discomfort with a candidate in his or her 70s than one who is gay, Muslim or an independent. Bryce Smith, 27, the Democratic Party chair in Dallas County, Iowa, said Mr. Sanders\u2019s health scare could hurt his chances \u2014 particularly against Ms. Warren. \u201cI do see that as something that is going to deter people that were maybe on the fence,\u201d he said. \u201cIf anyone was teetering between Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, this probably showed them that Elizabeth Warren has the stamina and the health and is a little bit younger in age to see it through eight years.\u201d Jill Alper, a Democratic strategist in Michigan and a veteran of Bill Clinton\u2019s and John Kerry\u2019s presidential bids, said voters would be watching Mr. Sanders closely in the next debate. \u201cDoes his energy level change? Does he campaign differently?\u201d she said. \u201cIf he maintains a reasonable energy level, it may not change anything for him.\u201d On Friday evening, after Mr. Sanders was released from the hospital, he dropped off his bags at his hotel and went for a walk in a park with his wife, Jane Sanders. The two were seen holding hands.",

      "author": "Jennifer Medina",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Pete Buttigieg on Monday compared Israel\u2019s relationship with the United States to that of a close friend \u2014 one who needed and should accept more guidance. Bernie Sanders put it in starker terms, saying the United States should demand more from Israel. But whatever the language, one thing was clear: Democratic attitudes toward Israel are shifting in the highest echelons of the party. Several Democratic presidential hopefuls spoke at a national conference hosted by J Street, a liberal lobbying group that describes itself as \u201cpro-Israel and pro-peace.\u201d Thousands of progressive Jewish activists gathered at the two-day conference, as candidates answered questions about what they would do to end the Israeli occupation in the West Bank as well as restart negotiations between Palestinians and the Israeli government. Such negotiations have long been at a standstill. But the questions went beyond what is known as the two-state solution, which would grant Palestinians statehood \u2014 an idea that many see as far-fetched or impossible under the Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu administrations. In a sign of how far the Trump administration has changed the conversation around Israel, several Democratic candidates said they were open to withholding aid from Israel if it annexed more land in the West Bank. Speakers at the conference repeatedly referred to what they called racist policies in both the United States and Israel. None of the candidates did so in more personal terms than Mr. Sanders, who opened his speech by referring to his own Jewishness, his time living on an Israeli kibbutz, and his father, who immigrated from Poland to escape anti-Semitism. \u201cIt is not anti-Semitism to say that the Netanyahu government has been racist \u2014 that is a fact,\u201d Mr. Sanders said, receiving enthusiastic applause from the audience. \u201cI\u2019m very proud to be Jewish and look forward to being the first Jewish president,\u201d he said, adding that Jews \u201chave suffered for century after century.\u201d \u201cIf there is any people on earth who understands the danger of racism and white nationalism,\u201d he said, rising from his chair to deliver each answer. \u201cIt is certainly the Jewish people.\u201d He went on to say that the Israeli government should not be given \u201ccarte blanche\u201d for spending the roughly $3.8 billion it receives in military aid. In 2017, the Trump administration moved the American Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv, and formally recognized Jerusalem as the country\u2019s capital, a move that broke with decades of United States policy. Jeremy Ben-Ami, the president of J Street, said that the group\u2019s polling showed that the vast majority of Democratic voters supported both Palestinians and Israelis but did not approve of Prime Minister Netanyahu, who has backed settlement expansion and annexation of more of the West Bank. In some quarters, any criticism of Israel is seen as a political risk that could leave candidates open to accusations of anti-Semitism. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be hard to be against bad policies and against anti-Semitism. Those are table stakes,\u201d Mr. Buttigieg said. \u201cYou can be committed to the U.S.-Israel alliance without being supportive of any individual choice by a right-wing government over there.\u201d J Street college activists have been pressing the Democratic Party to add to its official platform explicit language opposing Israel\u2019s occupation in the West Bank and a \u201ccommitment to Palestinian rights.\u201d Mr. Buttigieg also appealed directly to the young activists in the room. \u201cMathematically, it is within the lifetime of anybody in college today that the situation in Israel, for Israelis and Palestinians, will either reach some kind of harmony, or catastrophe,\u201d Mr. Buttigieg said. \u201cYou will live to see one of these two things happen.\u201d Former Housing Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro received sustained applause from the audience when he said that he would re-establish a consulate in East Jerusalem that would serve as an embassy for Palestinians under a two-state solution. \u201cI am glad to see in this Democratic Party that the voices of folks who are concerned about the rights of Palestinians has emerged recently stronger,\u201d Mr. Castro said, speaking after Mr. Buttigieg. On the question of whether he would withhold aid from Israel, Mr. Castro said it \u201cwouldn\u2019t be my first move.\u201d Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota also spoke at the conference, and declined to answer a question about military aid, saying only: \u201cIt\u2019s not a good idea to negotiate these things right now.\u201d Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado also attended the conference and echoed his refrain that Democrats have moved too far to the left to attract swing voters, including on foreign policy. The race\u2019s two leading candidates, former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren, did not attend the conference citing scheduling issues. But each of them recorded a video for the group, in which Ms. Warren repeatedly referred to the occupation, but Mr. Biden did not. Mr. Ben-Ami said in a speech to the group Sunday, the first day of the conference, that \u201cthere is simply no question under international law that Israel is an occupying power.\u201d \u201cGradually over these decades, a one-state reality has emerged between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea \u2014 an area where today well over 13 million people live, slightly less than half of whom are Jewish,\u201d Mr. Ben-Ami said. He said that the group would continue to ask all candidates \u201cwhat steps are they willing to consider should the occupation continue to deepen and the government of Israel consider formal annexation of all or parts of the West Bank?\u201d Ms. Klobuchar said at the conference on Sunday that she did not support Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s promise to annex more of the West Bank, but declined to say whether she would be willing to withhold aid if the Israeli government proceeded with such plans. She also defended her vote on legislation that would penalize groups that support the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement. \u201cIt just showed to me what Mitch McConnell is trying to do all the time: Instead of bringing people together for support of Israel on a bipartisan basis, he and President Trump are always looking for those wedges, a way to do things that creates wedges, instead of bringing people together,\u201d Ms. Klobuchar said. \u201cI think it has been very negative. And I\u2019m not just talking about one vote. I\u2019m talking about how the prime minister\u2019s visit was handled, as everyone remembers that.\u201d",

      "author": "Sydney Ember",
      "content": "  BURLINGTON, Vt. \u2014 When it comes time to make critical decisions regarding his presidential campaign, Senator Bernie Sanders often relies on a committee of two: himself and his wife, Jane Sanders. It was Ms. Sanders who provided a medical update after her husband was hospitalized in Las Vegas last week and had two stents inserted into an artery \u2014 issuing a statement and speaking to reporters outside the hospital. When doctors confirmed to her on Thursday that Mr. Sanders had suffered a heart attack, she said, it was her decision to wait until he was discharged the next day to release that information. And when it was time to say publicly that Mr. Sanders would be easing the pace of his campaigning after his heart attack, Ms. Sanders \u2014 who has effectively been running the campaign\u2019s external communications in Vermont this week \u2014 stood beside him to explain the reason: His closest advisers, \u201cespecially me,\u201d had told him to slow down. Ms. Sanders has played a central role in her husband\u2019s political life for decades, acting as his confidante and his closest adviser. Yet as Mr. Sanders weighs the future of his candidacy, never has it been clearer that the two of them are primarily making the calls for his campaign. \u201cHe\u2019ll often say, \u2018Let\u2019s talk to Jane,\u2019\u201d said Representative Ro Khanna of California, one of Mr. Sanders\u2019s national campaign co-chairs. \u201cShe\u2019s the one person Senator Sanders listens to above everybody else \u2014 by an order of magnitude,\u201d Mr. Khanna said. \u201cThere\u2019s no one whose political judgment he trusts more.\u201d In a rare interview on Wednesday at their home in Burlington, Ms. Sanders said it would be \u201cegotistical\u201d to call herself Mr. Sanders\u2019s top adviser but allowed that she was \u201cvery much a close adviser.\u201d Above all, she said, she was \u201chis wife.\u201d \u201cWe share a life, and his life is of public service,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I need to be part of that in order to have a wonderful marriage. It\u2019s necessary for us to work together because he works a lot.\u201d Mr. Sanders said in an interview with NBC News Wednesday that he learned he had suffered a heart attack on the night he entered the hospital last week with chest pains. Ms. Sanders, in the interview with The New York Times shortly afterward, said she only learned of it two days later, last Thursday. Ms. Sanders said the decision not to reveal her husband\u2019s heart attack until the next day was motivated by another crisis in her family occurring at the same time: the sudden cancer diagnosis of her daughter-in-law, Rain\u00e8 Riggs, the wife of Mr. Sanders\u2019s son, Levi Sanders. Ms. Riggs died this weekend, at age 46. \u201cI heard it on Thursday,\u201d Ms. Sanders said, referring to her husband\u2019s heart attack. \u201cBut frankly, I wasn\u2019t thinking about the campaign.\u201d Ms. Sanders\u2019s significant role in her husband\u2019s presidential run recalls the close involvement of other political spouses, including Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton and Nancy Reagan. They had other trusted aides, and Ms. Sanders said her husband does too, listing Jeff Weaver, his 2016 campaign manager who has been by his side for decades; Faiz Shakir, his 2020 campaign manager; and Ari Rabin-Havt, a deputy campaign manager. But if most politicians typically rely on their spouses as part of a larger group of consultants and close friends, Mr. Sanders maintains only a small inner circle and has long leaned primarily on his wife, who operates as something of a co-strategist for the Sanders brand. \u201cWhere Jane goes, Bernie goes,\u201d said Michael Ceraso, a high-ranking aide on Mr. Sanders\u2019s 2016 campaign in New Hampshire and California. \u201cShe is his engine.\u201d She is also fiercely protective of her husband\u2019s image. When Mr. Sanders had elective hernia surgery in 2015, for example, her preference was not to tell the media, according to a Democrat familiar with the conversations at the time. But other advisers convinced her and Mr. Sanders that if they did not disclose the operation and it was later revealed, their secrecy would create a firestorm in the press. Much like with his heart attack last month, the campaign initially only released a statement with spare details. The Sanders partnership formed soon after the two met at a political event during his first campaign for mayor in 1981. When he was in City Hall, she ran his youth office. They married in 1988. When Mr. Sanders was elected to Congress in 1990, Jane Sanders served as his unpaid chief of staff, vetting potential staff members and writing dozens of pieces of legislation. She helped him form the Congressional Progressive Caucus in 1991, worked on his re-election ads and liaised with reporters. Those who have worked with Mr. Sanders say his wife has extraordinary influence over his decisions. If they want him to sign off on something, one way to ensure it happens is to get her buy-in first. That level of trust has made her one of Mr. Sanders\u2019s most important assets. During the 2016 campaign, she was credited with helping to humanize her husband, who can come across as gruff and impersonal, offering a tour of their Burlington home and even showing reporters pictures of their wedding day from a photo album. But she has also complicated his presidential bid: A federal investigation into her role in a 2010 land deal as president of a Vermont college threatened to undercut his populist appeal. (Ms. Sanders\u2019s lawyer said last year that he had been told the investigation had been closed.) She also started a public policy group, the Sanders Institute, that attracted scrutiny because her son served as executive director and drew a salary of $100,000 last year. She suspended its operations in March soon after Mr. Sanders announced his run. And at times, her influence has also frustrated advisers. Some people familiar with the campaign said she would get annoyed when it appeared that decisions were being made without her input, often prompting her to try to reassert control. When Mr. Sanders\u2019s aides were finalizing plans for the campaign announcement earlier this year, for instance, Ms. Sanders questioned whether it was wise to start the race in Brooklyn: Some observers, she warned, might note that Hillary Clinton had located her campaign headquarters in Brooklyn in 2016. Her concern perplexed some Sanders advisers who wondered why that was relevant, according to one Democratic official familiar with the discussion, making the case that it was important to set the announcement in the city where Mr. Sanders and President Trump both grew up, to draw a contrast between their values. (Mr. Sanders ultimately did kick off his candidacy in Brooklyn, with a big rally that drew thousands of supporters.) Mr. Shakir, the campaign manager, said he never heard Ms. Sanders express any concern about the announcement decision. In another instance, Ms. Sanders was unhappy with one of the commercials Mr. Sanders\u2019s consulting team devised for his campaign kickoff earlier this year, people familiar with the matter said. Without discussing their plans with the consultants, the Sanderses decided that he would record a different, more unadorned advertisement from a Burlington studio \u2014 and he ultimately shared that version widely with supporters. But the move prompted the advisers, who played a central role in his 2016 bid, to abruptly quit the campaign. People who know her say Ms. Sanders\u2019s intense involvement stems both from her commitment to changing the world with progressive ideas and from her deep love for her husband. \u201cIt\u2019s a critical relationship for both of them,\u201d said Jim Rader, a Sanders confidant who officiated their wedding. \u201cI think she\u2019s just been a very crucial part of obviously his personal life, but also his professional life.\u201d In the interview, Ms. Sanders said she was most concerned now about getting Mr. Sanders back in good health, including changing his diet to incorporate more vegetables, especially while on the campaign trail. And though she admitted to being worried after his heart scare, she said it had not prompted them to consider dropping out of the race. \u201cThat\u2019s been his entire life \u2014 fighting for the average working people in this country, and this is not the time to stop when it feels like things can really change,\u201d she said. \u201cIf it was more serious,\u201d she added, \u201cI\u2019m sure we would have thought about it.\u201d",

      "author": "Lawrence K. Altman, M.D.",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 As Senator Bernie Sanders recuperates from the heart attack he suffered while campaigning last Tuesday in Las Vegas, he will inevitably face questions in the coming days as to whether he will continue his presidential campaign and, if so, at what pace. Let\u2019s start with some facts straightaway. A heart attack does not disqualify anyone from running for and holding public office. Modern medicine enabled Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower and Lyndon B. Johnson and Vice President Dick Cheney to continue in their roles after having suffered heart attacks, as others serving in Congress or state governments have done. (It is important to note that the popular but nonspecific term \u201cheart attack\u201d describes an array of heart problems; one is myocardial infarction, or the death of heart muscle cells, which is what Mr. Sanders had.) By every indication, Mr. Sanders plans to continue his campaign for the presidency, and even told staff members on a telephone call Monday that he feels more \u201cmore strongly about the need for a political revolution today than I did when I began this campaign.\u201d [The latest data and analysis to keep track of who\u2019s leading the race to be the Democratic nominee.] Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., one of the race\u2019s leading candidates, also once faced questions about his ability to serve in public office because of a serious medical problem. In 1988, as a 45-year-old senator from Delaware, he experienced a near fatal rupture of an aneurysm in an artery in his brain. Shortly after his emergency surgery for the aneurysm, he had a second one removed before it could burst. Because new cerebral aneurysms can develop years later in a tiny percentage of individuals, some experts suggested that Mr. Biden be examined for any new aneurysms when Barack Obama selected him as his running mate. At the time, Mr. Biden\u2019s doctor said that he did not need further testing because he had recovered fully and done well for 20 years. Mr. Sanders is certainly not the first candidate whose presidential campaign was disrupted by a medical emergency. In 1999, former Senator Bill Bradley made an unexpected visit to a hospital in the San Francisco Bay Area for atrial fibrillation, a heart rhythm abnormality, which he did not disclose until after the incident. After canceling a few events, Mr. Bradley, now 76, resumed his campaign, but he eventually dropped out of the race after losing the New Hampshire primary. A poll of New Hampshire voters revealed concern about how he had handled the disclosure of his health issue. Still, Mr. Sanders\u2019s case is unusual in many respects: He is a leading candidate recovering from a heart attack at age 78 who must compete in an intensely competitive primary while also holding down a demanding job as senator. Indeed, Mr. Sanders\u2019s disruption comes amid increased pressure to bolster voter support with strong challenges from Mr. Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren, and it is unclear at what pace Mr. Sanders will carry on his campaign. \u201cBernie will be scrutinized very carefully in the next month or two for his ability to come back and campaign as vigorously as he has done in the 2016 and current presidential campaigns,\u201d said Ed Rollins, a former adviser to President Ronald Reagan. \u201cHe\u2019ll be looked at a little differently\u201d for things like being tired at the end of the day or stumbling in his delivery onstage, Mr. Rollins added. \u201cI have never known a politician or big moneyed guy or anyone who has had a first heart attack\u201d not consider his mortality, Mr. Rollins added. Also, Mr. Sanders \u201csurely will think about a running mate.\u201d Based on the health information he and his doctor provided when he ran in 2016, it would not have been possible to predict the Vermont senator\u2019s heart attack last week. At that time, his doctor said that Mr. Sanders was \u201cin overall very good health\u201d and that his ailments included gout, a mild elevation of cholesterol, diverticulitis and an underactive thyroid gland for which he took daily hormone therapy. Tests showed that Mr. Sanders\u2019s thyroid function and electrocardiogram tests were normal and that he had no reported history of heart disease. It is not known whether Mr. Sanders has had a full medical checkup since then. Over the long term, however, \u201colder patients are at higher risk of recurrent cardiac events after a heart attack,\u201d said Dr. Christopher P. Cannon, a cardiologist at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston. \u201cBut Mr. Sanders appears to have few cardiac risk factors like high blood pressure and diabetes.\u201d He pointed to data from a series of his team\u2019s published studies that showed a one-in-five chance within five years after a first heart attack that a second one, or even stroke or death, might occur. But such population-based statistics provide general odds and cannot necessarily be applied to an individual. \u201cVery few illnesses would preclude someone from holding high office,\u201d said Dr. Jonathan S. Reiner, a cardiologist at George Washington University Hospital in Washington, who treated Mr. Cheney for serious heart disease for many years before, during and after his two terms in office. \u201cBut the public has a right to know the salient details because the ailment or treatment can affect how the candidate performs in office.\u201d Although there are legal protections to keep health information confidential, most candidates seeking the presidency in recent years have responded to the public demand to know and have waived that privilege. \u201cThe public should have sufficient facts to understand the magnitude of the event and the near- and long-term prognosis for the candidate,\u201d Dr. Reiner said. \u201cMr. Sanders\u2019s campaign has released too few details to understand the medical impact of the heart attack on his health.\u201d Not all heart attacks, for example, are of the same dimension. Like Mr. Sanders, three other presidential candidates are also septuagenarians. Mr. Biden will be 77 next month and Ms. Warren is 70. All three have said they will release their medical records before the Iowa caucuses that begin in February, although Mr. Sanders\u2019s incident last week may push his top rivals to disclose their records sooner. Then there is President Trump, who is 73. He has not said whether he would release any health information before or after his third presidential medical checkup, which is expected in early 2020. While presidents are not required to have medical checkups or release findings if they have one, Mr. Trump released a detailed summary after his first presidential exam and a less detailed one after his second, earlier this year.",

Herndon and Jonathan MartinPRINT EDITIONDemocrats Have Diverse Field, But the Top Tier Is All White|October 30, 2019, Page A1",
      "author": "Astead W. Herndon",
      "content": "  When the Democratic primary contest began last winter, it featured the most racially diverse field in history, with two black senators, a Latino former cabinet secretary, an Asian-American businessman and the first American Samoan elected to Congress. But 10 months later, the Democratic field has a top tier of four white candidates, three of them men. Candidates of color are languishing in the low single digits in polls, well behind the four leaders \u2014 former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. The divide could become even more pronounced in the coming months: Because of new, more rigorous thresholds for the Democratic debate in December, it is possible that only one nonwhite candidate, Senator Kamala Harris of California, will qualify. With the Iowa caucuses three months away, it\u2019s a noticeable sorting of the field for an increasingly multiracial party, whose most recent White House victories were powered by a strong minority turnout for a black nominee. It has frustrated the Democrats seeking a more diverse party leadership \u2014 not to mention the affected candidates. \u201cI\u2019ve had lots of crazy things said to me, like, \u2018Is America ready for another black president?\u2019\u201d Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey said in an interview. \u201cAnd I\u2019m confident it\u2019s never been asked of a white candidate, \u2018Is America ready for another white president?\u2019\u201d The emergence of an all-white top tier reflects a combination of factors at the intersection of race, money and politics. Financial support from mostly white, educated elites has helped propel the candidacies of Ms. Warren and Mr. Buttigieg, while two nonwhite candidates \u2014 Mr. Booker and Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former housing secretary \u2014 have had to explicitly petition supporters for money to stay in the race. Assumptions about which candidates can or can\u2019t beat President Trump have also hurt minority candidates, with some Democrats fearing that the white working class voters who helped propel Mr. Trump to the White House would not support a nonwhite nominee.  Donors for Mr. Booker and Ms. Harris have argued that such implicit bias causes voters and pundits to treat Mr. Buttigieg as the natural heir to Mr. Biden\u2019s moderate coalition, though their candidates perform better among older black voters, the Democrats\u2019 most loyal moderate voting block. Other Democrats, however, say the blame rests with the candidates themselves. None of the nonwhite challengers have been able to forge a strong coalition or peel away black voters from Mr. Biden. Some voters and elected officials, white and nonwhite alike, now say privately what the polling suggests: They have not been swept off their feet by any of the candidates of color. Theodore Johnson, who studies African-American politics at the Brennan Center for Justice, said the nonwhite contenders, fairly or not, are suffering in comparison to the country\u2019s first black president. \u201cTheir road is easier because of Obama, but their ability to secure the nomination is harder because they\u2019re not Obama,\u201d said Mr. Johnson. Miscalculations along the way have not helped. Ms. Harris has been criticized for waffling on policy, Mr. Booker for timidness and Mr. Castro for a failed debate attack on Mr. Biden in September, which cost him the endorsement of one of his few Congressional allies. Mr. Castro, in an interview, zeroed in on \u201celectability\u201d as a problem, saying that concept has created an unspoken skepticism of nonwhite candidates among Democratic voters. People with this viewpoint, he said, can sometimes see nonwhite candidates as vice-presidential options, but not best equipped to lead the party. \u201cIn every election there\u2019s a current, and the current this year seems to be running toward candidates that people believe can take Donald Trump on with a certain profile of voter \u2014 the white working class in the Midwest,\u201d said Mr. Castro, whose polling support is running at about 1 percent. And, he added, \u201cassumptions are being made on who the best type of candidates are to do that.\u201d Mr. Booker said he thinks the tide will turn as more people seek a strong candidate to replace Mr. Biden as the moderate alternative to Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders. The trouble: getting enough financial support over the next two months to remain viable. \u201cI have to say these last few weeks, a lot of \u2014 a lot more people seem to be coming around,\u201d Mr. Booker said, \u201cand I think some of this might be because they\u2019re seeing some weakness to Biden.\u201d Aimee Allison, founder of She the People, the network of women of color looking to mobilize for the 2020 general election, said it was too early to rule out unforeseen shifts in the race\u2019s current pecking order. But she added that it would take more than an argument for racial representation to win over voters of color and rise in the polls. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had choices like this before, and that makes essentialism less important,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s diversity of opinion. Women of color are sophisticated voters and organizers. We understand that our power and influence can be felt through a candidate of any race and gender with our agenda.\u201d Any assessment of the performance of nonwhite candidates is complicated by Mr. Biden\u2019s enduring appeal with black voters. The former vice president remains popular from his time in the White House serving with President Barack Obama, and he benefits from the perception among many Democrats that he has the best chance to win back white voters who flipped to Mr. Trump. That popularity with African-Americans has helped keep Mr. Biden at or near the lead in the race for months, while preventing candidates like Mr. Booker and Ms. Harris from making inroads in states like South Carolina. One recent poll gave Mr. Biden a 17-point lead over his closest rivals in the state, propelled by the support of about 40 percent of black voters. Even left wing activists who prefer other candidates acknowledge Mr. Biden\u2019s advantage will be difficult to overcome. \u201cLike many black homes in America, my parents\u2019 home has an Obama shrine,\u201d said Tamika Gadsden, a South Carolina-based activist who likes Ms. Warren and Mr. Castro but whose parents side solidly with Mr. Biden. If Mr. Biden falters in predominantly white states that vote earlier, there\u2019s no guarantee that black voters will desert him \u2014 or that their support would automatically go to the race\u2019s black candidates. And the white candidates positioning themselves as moderate alternatives to Mr. Biden, like Mr. Buttigieg and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, have posted dismal numbers with nonwhite voters. Likewise, the candidates vying for the progressive lane, Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders, still face heavy skepticism among the older black voters. \u201cIt\u2019s still early,\u201d said Representative Karen Bass of California, the head of the Congressional Black Caucus, \u201cI don\u2019t take the top four as the fait accompli.\u201d Ms. Warren, of course, would be barrier-breaking in her own right as the first woman to be president, as would Mr. Buttigieg, an openly gay man. Both have risen to the top tier of early-state and national polls, and both are flush with cash from a largely white donor network that has assured them of long term viability. Together, Mr. Sanders, Ms. Warren, Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg have $90 million in cash on hand. Ms. Harris, Mr. Booker, Mr. Castro, Andrew Yang, the Asian-American entrepreneur, and Tulsi Gabbard, the American-Samoan Congresswoman, have about $24 million combined. Mr. Booker and Mr. Castro have, in recent weeks, had to make desperate hat-in-hand pleas for money just to stay in the race, and both received online boosts from prominent black and Latino politicians including Stacey Abrams of Georgia and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, who alluded to the importance of racial representation.  The race could quickly change before voting begins in February. Ms. Harris has more money in the bank, and more endorsements from the Congressional Black Caucus, than Mr. Biden. Mr. Castro has not qualified for the November debate, but Mr. Booker and Ms. Harris have \u2014 and will have more opportunities to catch fire ahead of the Iowa caucuses, which will reshape all expectations in a single night. Conversely, while none of the leading white candidates have proved they can forge a multiracial coalition, they still have time to make inroads. Ms. Warren has gained good will from black and Latino progressives for infusing her policy proposals with planks about racial equity. Mr. Sanders has a vast and diverse donor base, and recently won endorsements from three of the country\u2019s most prominent minority lawmakers, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and Representatives Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan. Ms. Harris, Mr. Castro, and Mr. Booker are inhibited in part because they came up through the Democratic establishment, and have faced criticism for legislative records that are viewed as out of step with the ascendant progressive wing. Mr. Castro, in response, has tried to remake himself as a progressive champion, and even disavowed some of the deportation actions of Mr. Obama\u2019s administration, in which he served. Ms. Harris and Mr. Booker have tried to toe a more careful line, in hopes they can win more moderate black voters should Mr. Biden falter. Mr. Booker has been attacked for his closeness to big donors and mixed police reform record as mayor of Newark. Ms. Harris\u2019s lack of clarity on policy has drawn fire, both from left-wing activists upset with her record as a prosecutor and centrists annoyed that she backed left-wing ideas such as the Green New Deal. Because of this, some black and Latino Democrats push back on the idea that it\u2019s racism or assumptions about electability that have hindered Ms. Booker, Ms. Harris and Mr. Castro. Privately they claim that some nonwhite Democrats who decided not to run, such as Ms. Abrams of Georgia or Andrew Gillum of Florida, would have been stronger candidates. \u201cIt boils down to the candidates themselves,\u201d said Representative Filemon Vela of Texas. \u201cThose structural barriers existed when President Obama ran.\u201d Mr. Vela, for his part, is backing Mr. Biden, convinced that he\u2019s best suited to defeat Mr. Trump. But he thinks a woman of color should be on the ticket and he has one in mind: Senator Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada.",

      "author": "Sydney Ember",
      "content": "  BURLINGTON, Vt. \u2014 Senator Bernie Sanders, in a striking concession for a leading presidential candidate, said on Tuesday that he planned to slow down his pace on the campaign trail after suffering a heart attack a week ago, and acknowledged that voters would likely consider his health when deciding whether to support him. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to change the nature of the campaign a bit,\u201d Mr. Sanders told reporters after a visit with a local cardiologist. \u201cMake sure that I have the strength to do what I have to do.\u201d Mr. Sanders\u2019s remarks stood in sharp contrast with comments in recent days from his campaign advisers, who have insisted that the Vermont senator was neither changing course nor easing his trademark intensity as a result of the heart attack. Given Mr. Sanders\u2019s influential role in the Democratic race, not only as a top candidate but also as a driving force in policy debates, his decision to pull back campaigning injects new uncertainty into the contest \u2014 both for the future of Mr. Sanders\u2019s candidacy and the possible ramifications for other contenders. In recent weeks, the race has become more of a two-person contest between Senator Elizabeth Warren, a fellow liberal who shares many of the same goals as Mr. Sanders, and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., whose policy positions are generally more moderate. Ms. Warren has risen steadily in many polls while both Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders have lost some ground, particularly in surveys of Iowa voters, who will hold the first nominating contest in February. Pollsters said on Tuesday that it was too soon to determine or measure the impact of Mr. Sanders\u2019s health issues on voter preferences in the race, but they noted that his admission about his health would create a new challenge for Mr. Sanders, who, at 78, would be the oldest president ever elected by far. \u200b\u201cThis will just raise the issue of his age\u200b, which to me has always been the Achilles\u2019 heel of the Sanders campaign,\u201d said Andrew Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center, which polls public opinion in the key primary state. \u201cWhen Sanders ran for president in 2016, he was the not-Hillary Clinton candidate and no one paid attention to how old he is. Now, there will be a lot of attention to how old he is, and how old Joe Biden is.\u201d Mr. Biden is 76, while Ms. Warren is 70. President Trump is 73. Speaking to reporters outside his home in Burlington Tuesday, Mr. Sanders gave no indication that he was planning to drop out of the race and said he would continue to campaign actively. Indeed, Mr. Sanders remains formidable: He reported a third-quarter fund-raising total of $25.3 million, the largest in the Democratic field, and he has helped steer many in the party to embrace ideas like \u201cMedicare for all\u201d and tuition-free public colleges. Mr. Sanders has been campaigning almost nonstop when not carrying out his Senate duties in Washington, D.C., a pace that he pointedly noted on Tuesday. \u201cWe were doing, you know, in some cases five or six meetings a day, three or four rallies and town meetings and meeting with groups of people,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to do that.\u201d \u201cI think we\u2019re going to change the nature of the campaign a bit,\u201d he added. \u201cMake sure that I have the strength to do what I have to do.\u201d Asked to clarify what he meant when he said the campaign would change, he replied: \u201cProbably not doing four rallies a day.\u201d Standing next to his wife, Jane, Mr. Sanders also acknowledged that his heart attack could be a factor for voters considering whether to support him. \u201cEverything that happens every day weighs on how people feel about you,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd my own view is that \u2014 and I think it\u2019s the voters\u2019 view \u2014 you look at the totality of who a candidate is. You look at what that candidate stands for, the integrity of that candidate, the history of that candidate.\u201d It has been a difficult week for the Sanders family: In addition to Mr. Sanders\u2019s heart attack, his daughter-in-law Rain\u00e8 Riggs died at age 46, shortly after she was diagnosed with neuroendocrine cancer, according to a death notice. Ms. Riggs was the wife of Levi Sanders, Mr. Sanders\u2019s son. Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign aides were heartened that the first polls since his hospitalization did not show a significant drop in his support. But the candidate and his wife have not been revealing much to the public, or even some of his own staff, about when he would get back to the campaign trail and how aggressive he would be once he does return. It is now almost certain that he will have a far more difficult path to the nomination. Democrats are overwhelmingly focused on finding a candidate they believe can defeat Mr. Trump, having made clear in surveys that ousting a president they loathe is their top priority. Now, in addition to questions about whether he is too far to the left to win over general election voters, Mr. Sanders will have to face doubts about his physical capabilities. Further, unlike in 2016, progressive voters have an alternative to Mr. Sanders in this race. While some of his bedrock supporters will not abandon him, other left-wing voters will gladly cast a vote for Ms. Warren. That was not the case when Mr. Sanders faced Mrs. Clinton in the last primary. Mr. Sanders returned to Burlington over the weekend, after spending three days in a hospital in Las Vegas. His campaign said he felt chest pains during an event last Tuesday, and he was taken to the hospital, where two stents were inserted into an artery. Since then, his campaign has insisted that Mr. Sanders does not intend to drop out of the race. During a telephone call with staff members on Monday, Mr. Sanders said he felt \u201cmore strongly about the need for a political revolution today than I did when I began this campaign.\u201d Jane Sanders, who remains one of Mr. Sanders\u2019s closest advisers, said that idea was \u201csomething that the entire campaign, and especially me, have been saying for months \u2014 not for his health but for the ability to keep up that kind of a pace for everybody else, too.\u201d Campaign officials also downplayed Mr. Sanders\u2019s remarks. \u201cAs Bernie said, we are going to have an active campaign,\u201d Faiz Shakir, Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign manager, said in a statement on Tuesday evening. \u201cInstead of a breakneck series of events that lap the field, we are going to keep a marathoner\u2019s pace that still manages to outrun everyone else.\u201d Another adviser, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive topic, said Mr. Sanders had been thinking about changing the pace of his campaign schedule for some time, and aides discussed this with him when he was in the hospital. Known for keeping a grueling schedule on the campaign trail, Mr. Sanders, who finished second to Mrs. Clinton in the 2016 primary, will often crisscross a state with multiple stops for big rallies and smaller town hall-style events and gatherings. There is no recent precedent for a candidate to suffer such a serious health setback in the midst of a campaign, at least not since President Dwight D. Eisenhower suffered a heart attack in the fall of 1955, a year before his re-election. Mrs. Clinton stayed off the campaign trail for three days in the fall of 2016 after she felt dizzy at a 9/11 commemoration but was only diagnosed with pneumonia. In 1999, former Senator Bill Bradley was briefly sidelined as he sought the Democratic nomination because he had an irregular heartbeat. Mr. Bradley, a former professional basketball player who was only 56 at the time, returned to the campaign trail but was dogged by questions about his health and was beaten decisively by Al Gore.",

      "author": "Thomas Kaplan",
      "content": "   WASHINGTON \u2014 Senator Elizabeth Warren on Friday revealed her plan to pay for an expansive transformation of the nation\u2019s health care system, proposing huge tax increases on businesses and wealthy Americans to help cover $20.5 trillion in new federal spending. The plan represents a significant bet that enough voters will favor an approach that dismantles the current system and replaces it with \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d a government-run health insurance program. And it comes after decades in which Democrats have largely tiptoed around policy proposals that relied on major tax increases and Republicans ran on tax cuts. While the proposal allows Ms. Warren to say she is not raising taxes on the middle class, it opened her to renewed charges that her plan is too radical to pass through Congress. It represents an extraordinary embrace of the tax system to redistribute wealth and re-engineer one of the pillars of the American economy, with measures that would double her proposed wealth tax on billionaires and impose new levies on investment gains and even stock trades. \u201cThis debate has moved so far and so fast within the Democratic Party, it makes your head spin,\u201d said Larry Levitt, the executive vice president for health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation. \u201cIdeas that used to be political third rails are now being proposed by one of the leading candidates for president.\u201d Ms. Warren, of Massachusetts, is not the only Democratic presidential candidate envisioning a large new government program funded by tax increases. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Ms. Warren\u2019s top rival in the party\u2019s progressive wing, is the architect of Medicare for all and has also proposed sweeping changes. Together they are presenting a profoundly different vision from the one Democrats promoted as recently as the mid-1990s when President Bill Clinton declared in a State of the Union address that \u201cthe era of big government is over.\u201d While President Barack Obama pushed through the Affordable Care Act and managed to bring down the number of uninsured, he preserved a major role for the private sector in the country\u2019s health insurance system.  Under Ms. Warren\u2019s plan, private health insurance \u2014 which now covers most of the population \u2014 would be eliminated and replaced by free government health coverage for all Americans. That is a fundamental shift from a market-driven system that has defined health care in the United States for decades but produced vast inequities in quality, service and cost. Ms. Warren would pay for the new federal spending, $20.5 trillion over 10 years, through a mix of sources, including: Beyond the $20.5 trillion total, she is also counting on states and local governments to contribute an additional $6.1 trillion to help pay for the system. Like Mr. Sanders, Ms. Warren would essentially eliminate medical costs for individuals, including premiums, deductibles and other out-of-pocket expenses. But it is not clear if her plan would cover the costs of free health care for everyone. It relies on ambitious assumptions about how much it can lower payments to hospitals, doctors and pharmaceutical companies, and how cheaply such a large system could be run. Several economists have said providing free health care would cost trillions more over a decade. \u201cWe made different assumptions, because we didn\u2019t think these kinds of assumptions were realistic,\u201d said Linda Blumberg, a health economist at the Urban Institute, whose detailed assessment of Medicare for all found it would require $34 trillion in added federal spending. As Ms. Warren has risen steadily in the polls, with strong support from liberals excited about her ambitious policy plans, she has been under pressure from top rivals like former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. to release details about paying for health care. She has been asked over and over whether she would raise taxes on the middle class to pay for it, but had not answered directly until now. Her lack of specificity became a vulnerability as the primary race heated up, especially because she had established herself as the candidate with a plan for everything. Democratic rivals like Mr. Biden and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., who prefer building on the existing system of health coverage, have pointedly criticized her on the issue, with Mr. Buttigieg calling her \u201cextremely evasive.\u201d Two weeks ago, with no sign that the pressure would relent, she announced she would soon release her own financing plan. \u201cA key step in winning the public debate over Medicare for all will be explaining what this plan costs \u2014 and how to pay for it,\u201d Ms. Warren wrote in her plan. To do that, she added, \u201cWe don\u2019t need to raise taxes on the middle class by one penny.\u201d But whether such a detailed plan will end up as a strength or a liability is unknown, and represents a gamble for a candidate who has stirred doubts about her electability among establishment Democrats. Some in the party believe that concerns about income inequality and corporate greed have become such a powerful motivator that her stance will win her converts. Others say such a strong alignment with Medicare for all will haunt her if she gets to the general election. \u201cThis is not a symbolic proposal,\u201d Mr. Levitt said. \u201cThis is the most specific plan for Medicare for all that\u2019s ever been proposed by a candidate.\u201d \u201cCandidates often pivot to the center on issues in the general election,\u201d he added. \u201cThis proposal will make it more difficult for Warren to do that on health care.\u201d For Ms. Warren to achieve her desired health care transformation, she would need to persuade Congress to pass far-reaching legislation, an enormous political challenge and a virtual impossibility unless Democrats win control of the Senate. Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign quickly criticized Ms. Warren\u2019s plan as \u201cunrealistic.\u201d \u201cThe mathematical gymnastics in this plan are all geared towards hiding a simple truth from voters: It\u2019s impossible to pay for Medicare for all without middle-class tax increases,\u201d Kate Bedingfield, a deputy campaign manager for Mr. Biden, said in a statement. In an interview with \u201cPBS NewsHour,\u201d Mr. Biden said of Ms. Warren\u2019s plan, \u201cShe\u2019s making it up.\u201d Speaking to reporters in Des Moines, Ms. Warren rebuffed criticism of her proposal, saying: \u201cDemocrats are not going to win by repeating Republican talking points and by dusting off the points of view of the giant insurance companies and the giant drug companies who don\u2019t want to see any change in the law that will bite into their profits.\u201d She said anyone defending the profits of the insurance and drug companies was \u201crunning in the wrong presidential primary.\u201d The Republican National Committee described Ms. Warren\u2019s plan as a \u201cfairy tale,\u201d adding that it would have the effect of \u201cbankrupting the country and hurting the quality of care.\u201d The comments sent a signal of how President Trump and Republicans would portray her: as a tax-and-spend liberal who wants to vastly expand the role of the federal government while abolishing private health insurance. Her plan\u2019s price tag is equal to roughly one-third of what the federal government is currently projected to spend over the next decade in total. Still, the idea of government-run health insurance excites many liberal voters. Mr. Sanders has long championed single-payer health care, and Ms. Warren has aligned herself with him on the issue. A New York Times/Siena College poll released Friday found that about three-quarters of likely Democratic caucusgoers in Iowa supported creating a single-payer system, while about nine in 10 supported the creation of an optional government plan that any American could buy. Asked whether they would be likelier to support a candidate who promises to replace the existing health care system with Medicare for all or a candidate who promises to improve the current system, likely caucusgoers said by a 14-point margin that they preferred the second option. Ms. Warren\u2019s proposal shows just how large a reorganization of spending Medicare for all represents. By eliminating private health insurance and bringing every American into a federal system, trillions of dollars of spending by households, employers and state governments would be transferred into the federal budget over the course of a decade. Ms. Warren tries to minimize fiscal disruption by asking the big payers in the current system to keep paying. Her tax on employers is meant to replace the amount that companies now pay directly to health insurers. (Small businesses would be exempt if they are not currently paying for their employees\u2019 health care.) She has also proposed that states pay the federal government what they currently spend to cover state workers and low-income residents under the Medicaid program. But to help replace an estimated $11 trillion in health care spending that would be borne by American households over a decade \u2014 on premiums, deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs \u2014 Ms. Warren lays out a series of new taxes on corporations and wealthy people. She would raise $3 trillion in total from two proposals to tax the richest Americans. She has previously said that her wealth tax proposal would impose a 3 percent annual tax on net worth over $1 billion; she would now raise that to 6 percent. For the top 1 percent of households, she would tax investment gains annually instead of when the investments are sold. Ms. Warren is also counting on stronger tax enforcement to bring in more than $2 trillion in taxes that would otherwise go uncollected, as well as $800 billion in cuts to military spending. And she is banking on passing an overhaul of immigration laws \u2014 which itself would be a huge political feat \u2014 and gaining revenue from additional taxes paid by immigrants. Ms. Warren\u2019s plan would put substantial downward pressure on payments to hospitals, doctors and pharmaceutical companies. She expects that an aggressive negotiation system could lower spending on generic medications by 30 percent compared with what Medicare pays now, for example, and spending on brand-name prescription drugs could fall by 70 percent. Payments to hospitals would be 10 percent higher on average than what Medicare pays now, a rate that would make some hospitals whole but would lead to big reductions for others. She would reduce doctors\u2019 pay to the prices Medicare pays now, with additional reductions for specialists, and small increases to doctors who provide primary care.",

      "content": "  Bernie Sanders acknowledged on Wednesday that he knew he had suffered a heart attack three days before his campaign released that information, but he defended the decision to keep those details private. Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign had been inundated with questions from the news media last week as he recovered at a hospital in Las Vegas, and speculation about whether he had had a heart attack spread on social media and among voters. Campaign officials waited until Mr. Sanders was released from the hospital on Friday, smiling and waving to news reporters, before disclosing that he had. In an interview with NBC News, Mr. Sanders said a doctor at an urgent care facility in Las Vegas, where he went last Tuesday night after experiencing chest pain, had informed him that he was having a \u201cheart event.\u201d The interviewer then asked if the doctor had said he was having a heart attack, to which Mr. Sanders said, \u201cYeah.\u201d His campaign did not announce that until Friday, saying only that doctors had inserted two stents to open a blocked artery \u2014 a fairly common procedure. A heart attack, known medically as a myocardial infarction, means that there was at least some damage to the heart muscle. Mr. Sanders, 78, rejected the idea that his campaign had showed a lack of transparency in not disclosing the information more quickly. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t accept that. I think that\u2019s a media thing,\u201d he told NBC, adding that his campaign had been trying \u201cto understand what in fact is going on.\u201d \u201cI think we did it appropriately and did it as quickly as we could,\u201d he said. \u201cNo apologies.\u201d His wife, Jane Sanders, said in an interview with The New York Times that she had received the heart attack news on Thursday, and that it was her decision to wait to release that information until her husband was discharged the next day. Mr. Sanders and his family were dealing with another crisis at the same time: the cancer diagnosis of his daughter-in-law, Rain\u00e8 Riggs. Ms. Riggs \u2014 who was married to Mr. Sanders\u2019s son Levi Sanders \u2014 died this weekend at age 46. \u201cI heard it on Thursday,\u201d Ms. Sanders said, referring to her husband\u2019s heart attack. \u201cBut frankly, I wasn\u2019t thinking about the campaign.\u201d Asked in the NBC interview what voters should think with regard to the future of his campaign, Mr. Sanders said: \u201cPeople should think that I had a procedure which hundreds of thousands of people a year have. People should think that according to the doctors, I\u2019m on the way to a full recovery.\u201d",

      "author": "Giovanni Russonello",
      "content": " Welcome to Poll Watch, our weekly look at polling data and survey research on the candidates, voters and issues that will shape the 2020 election. Free tuition to public colleges? Just a few years ago it seemed unthinkable, but now it\u2019s a popular proposal embraced by some leading Democratic presidential candidates. Medicare for all? Same thing. But what about foreign policy? Are Democratic voters moving to the left on world affairs, too? There is at least one area in which the answer seems to be yes: the United States\u2019 once-unquestionable loyalty to Israel. At a conference this week sponsored by J Street, a group that advocates a progressive foreign policy toward Israel, several Democratic presidential candidates said the United States should consider withholding military aid if Israel continued to annex land in the West Bank. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be hard to be against bad policies and to be against anti-Semitism,\u201d Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., said echoing the critical tenor Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren used in their speeches. Last election cycle, such a stance might have seemed untenable. But polling data suggest that as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has drawn an increasingly hard line against Palestinians\u00a0while cultivating a chummy relationship with President Trump, many Jewish voters and liberal Democrats have started to feel uneasy. \u201cBoth Donald Trump and Bibi Netanyahu have approached this issue far differently than any of their predecessors, and Trump has made a real effort to align himself with Netanyahu and with the right in Israel,\u201d Jeremy Ben-Ami, the president of J Street, said in a phone interview. \u201cOver the past eight or nine years, with Bibi in control in Israel and now Trump here, you\u2019ve seen some real shifts in the ways that the partisanship on this issue plays out.\u201d Among Democrats, sympathy for Israel is weaker than it was before Mr. Netanyahu took office in 2009. When asked in a Gallup poll in February to choose which side of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict they sympathized with more, just 43 percent of Democrats said they were partial to Israel \u2014 the lowest number in 14 years. (Thirty percent said they sympathized with the Palestinians.) Among liberal Democrats, there is now almost an even split between those saying they sympathize with the Israeli side and the Palestinian one, according to Gallup. And a Pew survey conducted in April found that Jewish Americans were far more likely than Christians to say that Mr. Trump was \u201cfavoring the Israelis too much.\u201d Forty-two percent of Jewish respondents to the national poll said so, compared with just 6 percent saying he was too supportive of Palestinians. Only about one in four Christians said Mr. Trump was overly supportive of Israel. Jewish voters are among the Democratic Party\u2019s most loyal supporters. In the 2018 midterm elections, four out of every five Jewish voters said in exit polls that they had supported a Democratic candidate for Congress. And while Jewish Americans account for just 2 percent of the overall vote, they represent an outsize share of the Democrats\u2019 donor base. According to an analysis by The Forward, a Jewish publication, roughly 5.5 percent of all donors to Democratic presidential candidates in the first half of this year were Jewish, and they accounted for 7 percent of all funds given. (The Forward used several methods, including a research tool called the Distinctive Jewish Names list, to identify donors who were most likely Jewish in campaign finance reports.) The Forward found that the Democratic presidential candidate receiving the most donations from Jewish backers\u00a0this cycle has been Mr. Buttigieg, even as he has issued sharp critiques of Mr. Netanyahu. \u201cYou can be committed to the U.S.-Israel alliance without being supportive of any individual choice by a right-wing government over there,\u201d Mr. Buttigieg said at the J Street conference on Monday. Mr. Sanders, who would become the country\u2019s first Jewish president if elected, railed against giving \u201ccarte blanche to the Israeli government, or for that matter to any government at all.\u201d \u201cI would say that some of the $3.8 billion should go right now to humanitarian aid in Gaza,\u201d Mr. Sanders added, referring to the annual amount of military aid that the United States currently gives to Israel. Halie Soifer, the executive director of the Jewish Democratic Council of America, said that as Mr. Trump and Mr. Netanyahu have embraced more hawkish policies, Democratic politicians who are otherwise supportive of Israel have adopted a more critical stance. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen is a shift to the right, from Trump on down, whereby U.S. foreign policy no longer prioritizes a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat you\u2019ve heard recently are responses to shifts from the other side of the aisle, and frankly even shifts in terms of Israeli government policy.\u201d Last spring, J Street commissioned a Democratic firm to poll likely primary voters nationwide about their feelings on Israel. As the firm stated in its report, the poll found that among the Democratic electorate, \u201cthe political playbook on Israel has changed.\u201d Any survey conducted by a partisan group must be taken with a grain of salt, but the study\u2019s findings paint a detailed picture of a Democratic electorate that is generally supportive of Israel but also concerned about the potential for unfair treatment of Palestinians. The study found that Democratic voters are far more likely to say the United States should be an impartial broker in peace negotiations, instead of taking Israel\u2019s side. It showed little Democratic support for sending military and financial aid to Israel if it continued to annex land, or for recognizing Jerusalem as the Israeli capital, as Mr. Trump did in 2017, dealing a blow to the Palestinian nationalist cause. Mr. Ben-Ami attributed much of the shifting sentiment among Democrats to Mr. Trump and Mr. Netanyahu. Those leaders, he said, are \u201cthe two people who have had the most significant impact on changing this whole equation.\u201d",

      "author": "Sydney Ember",
      "content": "  DES MOINES \u2014 Displaying a new assertiveness toward her Democratic opponents, Elizabeth Warren laced into her chief political rivals, warning on Friday night that the country was in a \u201ctime of crisis\u201d and arguing that Democrats would lose in 2020 if they nominated \u201canyone who comes on this stage and tells you they can make change without a fight.\u201d Speaking to thunderous applause during the party\u2019s biggest Iowa political event of the year, Ms. Warren denounced candidates in the presidential race who opposed bold ideas in favor of more moderate solutions, in veiled attacks on Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Pete Buttigieg. \u201cFear and complacency does not win elections,\u201d she said at the Iowa Democratic Party\u2019s fund-raising dinner. \u201cHope and courage wins elections. I\u2019m not running some consultant-driven campaign with some vague ideas that are designed not to offend anyone.\u201d Befitting her front-runner status, Ms. Warren was the target of heated attacks from three of the first five speakers on the stage: Mr. Biden, Mr. Buttigieg and Kamala Harris. None of the candidates mentioned one another by name, though Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg both presented themselves as more capable of uniting the country. \u201cWe will fight when we must fight but I will never allow us to get so wrapped up in the fighting that we start to think that fighting is the point,\u201d Mr. Buttigieg said. Mr. Biden, who spoke directly after Mr. Buttigieg, extended the theme, saying, \u201cIf you can\u2019t bring the country together we\u2019re in real, real, real trouble.\u201d Even Ms. Harris, whose campaign is lagging to the point that she may not qualify for the party\u2019s December debate, attacked Ms. Warren personally for the first time. \u201cI\u2019ve only had one client in my life \u2014 the people,\u201d Ms. Harris said of her career as a prosecutor. \u201cUnlike others, I\u2019ve never represented a corporation.\u201d The sharp exchanges underscored the urgency motivating the candidates as the race enters its final phase ahead of the Iowa caucuses three months from now. The dinner occurred on one of the most consequential days of the race so far, with Ms. Warren, under pressure from other candidates over how she would pay for \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d finally introducing a long-awaited, $20.5 trillion proposal that immediately drew a fierce attack from her chief rival, Mr. Biden. Mr. Biden declared that under his health care plan, there would be \u201cno increase in taxes for the middle class. None, none, none,\u201d a shot at Ms. Warren\u2019s delay in articulating whether such taxpayers would see tax increases. Instead, Mr. Biden promised an opportunity to \u201cbuy into a Medicare-like proposal.\u201d The Biden, Buttigieg and Warren campaigns each bought large sections of the 16,000-seat Wells Fargo Arena here for supporters to cheer on their candidates. Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s section was particularly enthusiastic, clapping thundersticks and waving flashing lights throughout his address. Ms. Warren\u2019s fans were also spirited, unfurling a banner during her speech with the words, \u201cWin with Warren.\u201d Bernie Sanders, while speaking at the event, brought no supporters, electing to lead them in a march outside instead, part of a pattern of the independent senator\u2019s antipathy toward Democratic Party functions. At the same time, the candidates have been wooing voters with bus tours, rallies and town hall-style events. Ms. Harris, the California senator who is trying to revive her campaign, has taken to cooking Sunday night dinners in supporters\u2019 homes and plans to spend Thanksgiving in the state. The surge in attention on Iowa coincides with a more contentious phase of the race, marked by aggressive campaigning and an increased willingness to go on the offensive. Mr. Sanders, the senator from Vermont, and Mr. Biden, the former vice president, have resumed their attacks on each other, with back-and-forth sniping in the last week about Medicare for all and super PACs. Mr. Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar have shown an increased willingness to go after Ms. Warren, the senator from Massachusetts. Hours before the dinner was to begin, Former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas announced the end of his presidential campaign. His departure was so sudden that supporters had already planted scores of his signature black-and-white campaign signs outside the arena. Lower-tier candidates looking to energize their campaigns have also been more pugnacious: Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, for instance, has amped up her criticisms of the Democratic National Committee, the news media and even Hillary Clinton, who is not in the race. But nowhere has the battle been more intense than at the event on Friday, with candidates trading barbs less on specific policies, and more on political ideology. \u201cWe need big ideas, and here\u2019s the critical part: We need to be willing to fight for them,\u201d Ms. Warren said. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to give up on a big idea, but when we give up on big ideas, we give up on the people whose lives would be touched by those ideas.\u201d Of the top-tier candidates, only Mr. Sanders \u2014 the sole candidate to stand stationary and speak from note on a lectern \u2014 did not attack his opponents, instead delivering a version of his standard stump speech that championed the working class and took aim at corporate interests and the rich. He quoted Franklin D. Roosevelt and Nelson Mandela and provided pleas for his signature policy proposals, including \u201cMedicare for all\u201d and tuition-free public college. He also announced his campaign was donating $20,000 to the Iowa Democratic Party in a symbolic show of solidarity even as he continues to eschew traditional party politicking. The crowded and diverse field \u2014 there are still 17 candidates \u2014 has proved challenging for contenders outside the top tier. While nine have qualified for the party\u2019s November debate in Atlanta, just four are guaranteed a spot for the December debate in Los Angeles. A poll taken this week of likely caucusgoers by The New York Times and Siena College shows the top four candidates locked in an extraordinarily tight race. Ms. Warren held a narrow advantage, with the support of 22 percent of voters, while Mr. Sanders drew 19 percent and Mr. Buttigieg 18 percent. Mr. Biden, who entered the race as a front-runner, had the backing of 17 percent of likely caucusgoers, much weaker than his position in national polls. For Democrats who had been inclined to support Mr. Biden but now find themselves shopping around, that means the moderate choices are limited to Mr. Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., and Ms. Klobuchar, the senator from Minnesota, with other would-be options like Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey falling out of the conversation. Susan Swift, a 58-year-old yoga teacher from Dubuque, said at a Biden event Wednesday that even after watching nine months of campaigning she was still trying to decipher the field. Ms. Swift said she liked the former vice president for \u201chis experience,\u201d but had become more impressed with Mr. Buttigieg the more she had seen him. \u201cDid you see the pluck that that guy had in the last debate?\u201d she said. \u201cSeriously? I was like, \u2018You just won my heart.\u2019\u201d Conversations this week with 24 of Iowa\u2019s 99 Democratic county leaders revealed moderate Democrats moving from Mr. Biden toward Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Klobuchar, who the county officials said had benefited from strong debate performances and repeated trips to the state. Mr. Sanders, who fought Mrs. Clinton to a draw in Iowa four years ago, has struggled to retain support in the party\u2019s most liberal pockets. Some of his anti-establishment backers have gravitated to candidates even more outside the mainstream, like the entrepreneur Andrew Yang and Ms. Gabbard. Zach Simonson, the Democratic chairman in Wapello County, backed Mr. Sanders in 2016 and said he was now torn between Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren. \u201cI was all in for Bernie in 2016, but with Warren in the race, some of the weaker parts of his candidacy are magnified,\u201d Mr. Simonson said. \u201cHe\u2019s got a very reasonable critique of the national Democratic Party institution, but from campaigning so much on the outside, I don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll be ready to take the role of national standard-bearer for all Democrats after the convention.\u201d ",

The survey is full of alarming signs for Mr. Biden, who entered the race in April at the top of the polls in Iowa and nationally. He is still in the lead in most national polls, but his comparatively weak position in the earliest primary and caucus states now presents a serious threat to his candidacy. With the Iowa caucuses just three months away, Mr. Biden\u2019s unsteadiness appears to have opened a path in the race for other Democrats closer to the political middle, particularly Mr. Buttigieg. The poll reveals a race in flux but not in disarray, framed by a stark debate about the direction of the Democratic Party and by a degree of fluidity arising from Mr. Biden\u2019s travails. In the early states, at least, the former vice president appears to be buckling on one side to the expansive populism of Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders, and on the other to Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s calls for generational change. While no single candidate has a decisive advantage, the strongest currents in the party appear to be swirling around candidates promising in different ways to challenge the existing political and economic order. Several of them would also represent change by virtue of their identities, including Ms. Warren, who would be the first female president, and Mr. Buttigieg, who is gay. But despite the historic diversity of the field, all the top candidates are white. In Iowa, a state that helped vault Barack Obama into the presidency, the poll found a substantial bloc concerned that anyone other than a heterosexual white man might struggle to defeat President Trump. The survey found Iowa Democrats in a divided and perhaps indecisive state about what the party must do in order to deny Mr. Trump a second term. They are an ideologically mixed group, with younger voters trending to the left and leaning strongly toward Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders. Mr. Biden remains the favorite candidate of older voters, but only 2 percent of respondents under 45 years old said they currently plan to caucus for him. The caucuses are Feb. 3. In the poll, large majorities were supportive of ambitious liberal policy goals, like breaking up big banks, increasing Social Security benefits and implementing single-payer health care. But perhaps out of political caution, the poll also found that more Democrats would prefer to nominate someone who supports improving the private health insurance system rather than replacing it altogether. And most Democrats said they would favor a nominee willing to work with Republicans. There is still plenty of room for shifts in political momentum: Two-thirds of likely caucusgoers in The Times poll said they could still be persuaded to change their minds. Outside the top tier of four candidates, the best-performing Democrat was Senator Amy Klobuchar, supported by 4 percent of respondents, followed by Senator Kamala Harris and Andrew Yang, both at 3 percent, and Senator Cory Booker, Representative Tulsi Gabbard and Tom Steyer, all at 2 percent. The Iowa caucuses are a fairly arcane institution that differs from a standard primary election. They traditionally require Democrats to gather at myriad locations around the state for a multiround process in which voters group themselves behind their first-choice candidate; if a candidate registers less than 15 percent support, their supporters can reallocate themselves to other candidates. Factoring in voters\u2019 second choices, Ms. Warren had the broadest appeal: She is the first or second preference of 47 percent of Iowa Democrats, with two-thirds of Sanders supporters naming her as their backup choice. Mr. Sanders is the first or second choice of 34 percent of likely caucusgoers, followed by Mr. Buttigieg at 31 percent. Mr. Biden was in fourth place by this measure, at 28 percent; only 1 in 10 voters named him as their second choice. The Times/Siena survey of 439 Iowa Democratic caucusgoers was conducted from Oct. 25-30 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.7 percentage points. Here are the full results and the methodology for the poll. One issue that occasions little division among Democrats is impeachment. Eighty-nine percent of people in the poll said they support impeaching Mr. Trump and removing him from office. Most Iowa Democrats in the poll said they were somewhat or very confident that the party\u2019s top candidates would beat Mr. Trump in the general election. There was no difference in how they assessed Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren on that measure, and Mr. Sanders and Mr. Buttigieg fared only slightly worse. The confidence Iowa Democrats expressed in Ms. Warren as a general-election candidate could represent something of a turning point for her candidacy, if she can extend the sentiment to other early states. For much of the race, even Democratic voters who have embraced her ideas and political persona have harbored reservations about her odds against Mr. Trump. In Iowa, that appears to have changed. Jonathan Morrison, 45, of Mason City, said he was drawn to Ms. Warren because of her grasp of economic issues and believed she would \u201chold her own\u201d against the president. \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s going to allow herself to be pushed around or bullied by Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s going to stick to the facts and call him out on his policies.\u201d Mr. Morrison, who said he is a drone pilot in the oil and gas industry, said he also liked Mr. Buttigieg, whom he described as having a \u201cleadership aura about him.\u201d \u201cI think Pete Buttigieg is going to be president someday,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure it\u2019s this time around.\u201d Both Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders appear to be tapping into a thirst among many primary voters for transformational policies rather than incremental improvements in governance. But the presence of two forceful, well-funded populists in the race may be preventing either Mr. Sanders or Ms. Warren from gaining a wide advantage. They have assembled somewhat different political coalitions: Ms. Warren is the top choice of younger voters, women and people with college degrees, while Mr. Sanders fares better with men and people with high school degrees or less. He also retains significant backing from young people, and his supporters are the least likely to say they might change their minds before February. Though Mr. Buttigieg would be the youngest president ever, he is not exceptionally popular with his generational cohort. He fared somewhat better with older voters than younger ones; like Ms. Warren, he registered strongly among people with college and postgraduate degrees. Mr. Biden\u2019s support comes almost exclusively from older voters: Among people 65 years or older, he is still the front-runner, with backing from nearly a third of them. But he has negligible support among younger Iowans. With voters under 45, Mr. Biden is polling several points behind Mr. Yang, a former tech executive who has never run for office before. An ideological gulf, running along generational lines, is a major feature of the Democratic race. Two-thirds of voters under 30 favored either Ms. Warren or Mr. Sanders, while a smaller majority of people over 65 favored either Mr. Biden or Mr. Buttigieg. An overwhelming 85 percent of voters under 30 said they preferred a nominee promising fundamental change over one seeking to restore normalcy in Washington. Among voters more than 65 years old, 7 in 10 preferred a candidate who would bring back normalcy. William Nix of Waterloo, Iowa, is among the young voters torn between several candidates promising large-scale change. He said he had long admired Mr. Sanders but worried that he might pull out of the race after his recent heart attack. Mr. Nix, who is 21 and works on an assembly line at John Deere, said he was considering Ms. Warren and Mr. Buttigieg, and wanted a nominee focused on economic inequality and access to education. \u201cI\u2019m really all for making going to college more affordable,\u201d Mr. Nix said. \u201cThat is my biggest thing, because I want to go to college myself.\u201d Most Iowa Democrats appear to believe it is easier for candidates who are heterosexual, white, male and ideologically moderate to win presidential races, though that assessment is not playing a decisive role in shaping their caucus preferences. Most poll respondents said they believed it would be harder to win the election with a nominee who is more liberal than most Democrats, or one who is gay. About half expressed those reservations about a female nominee, and 4 in 10 were pessimistic about an African-American candidate These reservations about embracing the diversity of their presidential field have not translated into enthusiasm for Mr. Biden. One reason may be his age: A majority of respondents said they believed it would be harder to win the election with a candidate over the age of 75. Both Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders would turn 80 within a year or two of taking office. Julia Roberts, a voter in Winterset, Iowa, is among those wary of nominating someone whose identity could unsettle rural conservatives. Ms. Roberts, 60, a retired state employee, favored Mr. Biden because she saw him as the strongest general-election candidate and valued his foreign policy experience. \u201cI think, really, he\u2019s got the best chance of beating Trump,\u201d Ms. Roberts said, adding that she also liked Ms. Warren and Mr. Buttigieg but feared there would be \u201cprejudice in play\u201d against them.  Tonda Hadden, 63, of Council Bluffs, Iowa, said she had originally favored Mr. Biden or Mr. Sanders. But she worried Mr. Sanders was \u201ctoo old and too left.\u201d With Mr. Biden, she had grown \u201ca little worried about his gaffes.\u201d Ms. Hadden said she was now \u201cstill looking\u201d over her options: She named Ms. Warren as her current favorite and Mr. Buttigieg as an intriguing alternative. And she said she hoped some others, like Mr. Booker, whom she saw interviewed Wednesday on \u201cThe View,\u201d would get a closer look from voters. \u201cI really like him,\u201d she said of Mr. Booker, \u201cand I don\u2019t understand why he\u2019s not up in the polls.\u201d",

      "author": "Lisa Lerer",
      "content": " Hi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I\u2019m Lisa Lerer, your host, bringing you a dispatch from my weekend reporting trip to Iowa. Democrats put on quite a show Friday night in Des Moines at their Liberty & Justice Celebration, a 13-candidate event considered the start of the final, three-month sprint to the Iowa caucuses. There were smoke machines! Spotlights! A runway! And, of course, thundersticks! Was this W.W.E.? No, it was the Iowa Democratic Party\u2019s annual dinner. Somehow, amid the shouts of the booming announcer and the migraine-inducing glare of thousands of glow sticks, it became clear to me that the race has entered a new phase. There has been no defining moment. No devastating gaffe. But over the past few weeks, the race in Iowa has begun to take a very different form than it had when the candidates sweated through the state fair just three months ago. For months, this was a contest between two of the biggest boldface names in Democratic politics \u2014 former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Now, the number of leading contenders has essentially doubled, creating a four-way race with Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders, yes, but also with Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. A New York Times/Siena College poll of likely caucusgoers taken last week showed those four candidates knotted at the top of the field. As I wrote with my colleague Reid Epstein over the weekend, the energy seems to be with the two fresher faces, who used the dinner as a display of organizational force. Mr. Buttigieg, helped by a cheering section of around 1,000 superfans who flew in from across the country to attend the dinner, cast himself as the heir to President Barack Obama\u2019s political legacy in his remarks \u2014 a direct shot at one of Mr. Biden\u2019s central arguments. Ms. Warren used her speech to debut a new line of attack against Mr. Biden, Mr. Buttigieg and her other centrist rivals. \u201cAnyone who comes on this stage and tells you to dream small and give up early is not going to lead our party to victory,\u201d she said. The attack underscored how questions about her \u201cMedicare for all\u201d plan have become central to this race. The Friday release of Ms. Warren\u2019s long-awaited, $20.5 trillion proposal explaining how she would fund the program prompted a new series of attacks over the weekend about the plan\u2019s specifics and whether she is being honest about the price tag. Her campaign plans to release a proposal detailing how she would manage the transition from private health insurance plans to universal government-run health coverage. But the questions are likely to trail her for the foreseeable future. Also worth noting from this weekend: The supersized field has finally begun shrinking to merely pleasantly plump. Former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas dropped out on Friday night, and rumors abound of other exits that could be coming soon. Of course, not everything has changed. As has been the case since the start of this crowded contest, most of the field has found it all but impossible to break out of the single digits in polling. At the dinner, Senators Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota delivered strong performances \u2014 to a half-empty room. (Both had the unlucky draw of speaking toward the end of the five-hour program.) And they had it far better than some of the candidates who followed. Former Representative John Delaney of Maryland was introduced with photos of Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana on the screens. And Mr. Bullock delivered the final address of the event \u2014 after being announced as Mr. Booker. Want more about Ms. Warren? Check out this story I wrote for the paper today with the ace business reporter Kate Kelly. We dive into the fury that her rise in the polls has ignited on Wall Street, where money mangers, investors and bankers are contemplating voting for President Trump, threatening to leave the country and loudly predicting a double-digit dive in the market if Ms. Warren is elected. Ms. Warren and her campaign see their rage as more beneficial than any monetary contribution. The joke making the rounds among Democrats on Wall Street is that every time a banker complains, Ms. Warren gets another thousand votes in Iowa. We want to hear from our readers. Have a question? We\u2019ll try to answer it. Have a comment? We\u2019re all ears. Email us at onpolitics@nytimes.com. As several states go to the polls, we\u2019ll have live results on NYTimes.com and in the NYTimes app on Tuesday night. Here\u2019s a cheat sheet from our colleague Trip Gabriel: Three states have particularly consequential elections on Tuesday. Kentucky and Mississippi are choosing governors in unexpectedly competitive races. But perhaps the biggest attraction is in Virginia, where control of the state legislature is up for grabs. Two years ago, the majority in the state\u2019s House of Delegates turned on a random drawing to settle a tied race. If Democrats reverse the slim majorities that Republicans hold in both chambers \u2014 as polling and a court-ordered new map of key districts suggest is likely \u2014 it will cap off a decade-long evolution of a Southern state, the former seat of the Confederacy, into a progressive bastion. With a sitting Democratic governor, Ralph Northam, new Democratic majorities in the legislature would be expected to advance liberal priorities on gun restrictions, the minimum wage, health care and civil rights protections for women and L.G.B.T. people. Perhaps most important to Democrats, unified control of state government would put the party in charge of mapping new voting districts in 2021. Virginia, which holds elections every year, has been at the forefront of a national revolt against President Trump among suburban voters since 2017. Tuesday night\u2019s returns are certain to be interpreted as a report card on Mr. Trump ahead of 2020. But Virginia is not an ideal presidential bellwether. Republicans have not won a statewide election there since 2009. These elections, like local elections everywhere now, are a kind of referendum on the president; but the simple toting up of W\u2019s and L\u2019s will not be especially meaningful. More telling will be the intensity of both parties\u2019 voters. Look for the margins of victory or loss, and the overall turnout, which nonpartisan analysts think will be in the mid-40s.

      "author": "Matt Stevens",
      "content": "  It was another busy week in Washington and on the campaign trail. Here is our quick rundown of what happened in the 2020 race. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont had a heart attack this week, and doctors inserted two stents to open a blocked artery. Mr. Sanders, 78, was taken to a Las Vegas hospital on Wednesday after he experienced \u201csome chest discomfort\u201d at an event Tuesday night. His wife, Jane Sanders, later said that he was resting comfortably and that he would participate in the next Democratic debate, on Oct. 15. The news that he\u2019d had a heart attack was not revealed until he was discharged from the hospital on Friday. The end of the third fiscal quarter was Monday, and candidates have started announcing their fund-raising totals for July, August and September. We\u2019re tracking the numbers here. Our colleague Reid J. Epstein wrote about the last-minute email scramble for donations. (Meet our goal! Save the kittens!) Here\u2019s where some of the candidates ended up: President Trump\u2019s re-election campaign and the Republican National Committee raised a combined $125 million in the third quarter. Of course, the numbers aren\u2019t directly comparable to the Democratic hauls, since each donor can give hundreds of thousands of dollars to the R.N.C., but only $5,600 to an individual candidate. On Wednesday, Mr. Biden delivered his most forceful response yet to Mr. Trump\u2019s requests that foreign countries investigate unsubstantiated allegations about him and his son Hunter. He accused the Trump team of trying to use \u201clies, smears, distortions and name calling\u201d to knock him out of the presidential race. Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign also contacted television anchors and networks on Sunday to \u201cdemand\u201d that Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, be kept off the air for promoting \u201cfalse, debunked conspiracy theories.\u201d Ms. Harris, for her part, called (in a tweet and more formally in a letter) on Twitter to suspend Mr. Trump\u2019s account for what she said was harassment of the whistle-blower, a violation of the platform\u2019s terms of service. It\u2019s official: The next Democratic debate will feature a dozen candidates onstage at once. As we\u2019ve mentioned before, the Oct. 15 debate in Ohio will feature the 10 candidates who appeared at last month\u2019s event as well as Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii and Tom Steyer, the former hedge fund investor. In the world of not-so-surprising news, we learned on Tuesday that Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, is not a fan of Ms. Warren\u2019s plan to \u201cbreak up big tech.\u201d \u201cIf she gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg told Facebook employees, according to recordings leaked to The Verge. Suffice it to say, there were more remarks where those came from, and Ms. Warren offered some of her own: Facebook, she said, had repeatedly fumbled its \u201cresponsibility to protect our democracy.\u201d Nine of the 2020 candidates appeared at a gun policy forum in Las Vegas on Wednesday, two years and one day after a gunman massacred 58 concertgoers there, and expressed their collective support for sweeping new gun restrictions. Gun control once splintered Democrats along regional and ideological lines, but the party is increasingly unified around an assault weapons ban, gun licensing and other measures. Before the event, both Mr. Biden (who participated) and Mr. Steyer (who wasn\u2019t invited) released gun control plans. On Monday, Mr. Sanders unveiled another proposal aimed at reducing income inequality: a corporate tax that would penalize the country\u2019s largest companies if they don\u2019t narrow the gap between what they pay their top executives and what they pay their workers. Two days later, Ms. Warren outlined a new tax on \u201cexcessive lobbying,\u201d which would apply to corporations and trade organizations that spend more than $500,000 a year lobbying the government. When \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d does an entire skit on a Democratic debate, all the time you\u2019ve spent trying to keep up with this clown-car primary can suddenly seem worth it. Enjoy the \u201ccorn pop\u201d story, Maya Rudolph\u2019s portrayal of Ms. Harris, and this very good tweet from Ms. Harris herself.",

What we don\u2019t know: A lot, still.By Giovanni RussonelloPRINT EDITIONPoll Puts Four in a Tie, With Many Iowa Voters Still Open to Persuasion|November 3, 2019, Page A19",
      "author": "Giovanni Russonello",
      "content": " Senator Elizabeth Warren is starting to stand out in Iowa, as Friday\u2019s New York Times/Siena College poll shows. But she isn\u2019t standing alone \u2014\u00a0at least not yet. With the candidacy of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. cooling off, the race now looks more interesting than at any point since campaigning in Iowa began intensifying over the summer. Here are a few major takeaways from the poll. The Iowa poll demonstrated that Ms. Warren has strength in Iowa, and room to grow \u2014\u00a0but she has not quite broken out of the pack. All four of the top candidates \u2014 Ms. Warren, Mr. Biden, Senator Bernie Sanders and Mayor Pete Buttigieg \u2014\u00a0are technically locked in a statistical tie, according to the poll\u2019s 4.7-point margin of error. Then there\u2019s the fact that 65 percent of Iowa voters who named a first-choice candidate said they could still be persuaded to caucus for someone else. While Ms. Warren is at the top of the crowded bunch with 23 percent of the overall vote, only about a quarter of her supporters are certain they\u2019ll caucus for her\u00a0on Feb. 3. That said, there is evidence to suggest that her support is solidifying. Ms. Warren is the second-choice pick of 25 percent of voters with a chosen candidate \u2014 that\u2019s 10 points higher than Mr. Sanders, the runner-up. And she leads among the two-thirds of voters who say they\u2019re paying very close attention to the news; she has 23 percent support from that group, compared to Mr. Sanders\u2019 16 percent. As the caucuses near and attention picks up, she may have a particularly good shot at winning over voters who are just tuning in. With Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign faltering slightly, there are signs hidden within these poll results that he is still relying heavily on name recognition, rather than enthusiasm. He is buoyed by the sense \u2014\u00a0held by four in five Democratic voters \u2014\u00a0that he would have a good chance of beating President Trump in the general election. Slim majorities of Democratic voters say they would prefer a moderate candidate and one who promises to find common ground, rather than a trenchant liberal. But Mr. Buttigieg also polls formidably among these middle-path voters, and he is fast on Mr. Biden\u2019s heels. They are roughly tied for the lead among voters looking for a candidate who will\u00a0seek common ground with political opponents. Meanwhile, Mr. Biden doesn\u2019t command even 10 percent among the liberal Iowa voters that make up the party\u2019s core. Only 2 percent of voters underage 45 said they would support him. And he draws a good deal of his backing from those who say they have never attended a caucus before, possibly showing that his numbers are being pumped up by respondents who are less engaged\u00a0\u2014 and perhaps, less likely to turn out. Mr. Sanders, who nearly won the Iowa caucuses four years ago,\u00a0stands at 19 percent in the poll, revealing that he has held onto a durable \u2014 but diminished \u2014 following. Ms. Warren has already swept up support among what was once his most solid demographic: young voters. According to the poll, Ms. Warren was the choice of a whopping 38 percent of voters under 30, compared to 29 percent for Mr. Sanders. But neither of them has been able to capture even one out of every five voters age 45 and over. Ms. Warren seems to have annexed much of Mr. Sanders\u2019 support among very liberal caucusgoers; she now has 37 percent of them in her corner, compared to 28 percent for him. Not all of the Democratic voters who are gravitating toward Ms. Warren express passion for each element of her progressive agenda. Two-thirds strongly back the idea of a public health care option, and a majority \u2014\u00a057 percent \u2014\u00a0also strongly support increasing Social Security benefits. But there is less widespread enthusiasm for some of the boldest progressive proposals that Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders have put forth. Just one-third of Democratic voters expressed strong support for giving free college tuition to all Americans, and only 43 percent strongly believe the big banks and tech companies should be broken up. Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s and Mr. Biden\u2019s backers tend not to be enthusiastic about those ideas. Yet Ms. Warren has managed to assemble an ideologically diverse coalition. Though her supporters generally skew liberal, most of\u00a0them don\u2019t feel strongly about eliminating college tuition, and almost half don\u2019t express strong support for breaking up banks and tech companies. Health care has been the most discussed issue of the primary season, with Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren advocating a \u201cMedicare for all\u201d bill and more moderate candidates calling for a public option. The poll found that most Democratic voters in Iowa are open to a single payer-type plan, but a majority would prefer a candidate who seeks to strengthen the Affordable Care Act and add a public option. While Mr. Sanders\u2019 Iowa supporters are united in their desire for a single-payer health care system, Ms. Warren brings together a broader spectrum: Barely over half of her voters feel strongly about getting rid of private insurance. This suggests that Ms. Warren has room to grow among the substantial share of voters who are less interested in Medicare for all, and who have not yet settled on a final candidate choice. It is impossible to say just how many voters will actually turn out in a primary, or which groups will vote in the greatest numbers. At caucuses, which are more sparsely attended, it\u2019s especially hard to know. So, remember that like all the pre-election surveys that you\u2019ll see in the coming months, the results of this one were dictated in part by how our team defined the probable electorate. Add in the complex set of rules governing the Iowa caucuses \u2014 where backers of less-popular candidates will eventually have to throw their support to someone else on the night of the election \u2014 and it all adds up to a lot of uncertainty. This poll is nothing more than our attempt at a snapshot of where things are at, three months out. Besides that, Iowa\u2019s voters are more than 90 percent white, so the results of this poll carry only the faintest of implications about how the race will play out in the rest of the country. After Iowa\u2019s caucuses and the first primary a week later, in heavily white New Hampshire, the importance of the party\u2019s nonwhite electorate \u2014 particularly black and Hispanic voters \u2014 will come back into the foreground. From late February through Super Tuesday on March 3, the focus will be on major contests in Southern and Western states.",

      "content": "  CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa \u2014 For months, the presidential race in Iowa was a contest between two titans of the Democratic political world, each representing distinct poles of a party struggling to define its identity in the Trump era. Now, with just three months to go before the caucuses, the ideological debate has remained the same, but the key players have shifted. For now, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is being eclipsed by Mayor Pete Buttigieg, of South Bend, Ind., a Midwestern mayor less than half his age who has captured the energy of those looking for the party to move in a more centrist direction. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has seen much of the message that had lifted him to political fame in the 2016 primary contest co-opted by Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. In polling, enthusiasm and organization, there is now a yawning gap between Ms. Warren, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Biden, Mr. Buttigieg and the other 13 Democrats running for president. A poll taken this week of likely caucusgoers by The New York Times and Siena College shows the top four candidates locked in a virtual tie atop the field, with the next contenders \u2014 starting with Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, at least 13 percentage points behind. [The latest data and analysis to keep track of who\u2019s leading the race to be the Democratic nominee.] Yet, in a field that once numbered two dozen, it is Ms. Warren and Mr. Buttigieg who have emerged as coveted fresh faces, riding a surge of momentum. Both have been rising for months \u2014 Mr. Buttigieg from the obscurity of leading a community of 100,000 people and Ms. Warren from early campaign missteps highlighted by her ill-fated decision to release a DNA test designed to combat charges that she exaggerated her Native American ancestry. With three months to go, the emergence of Ms. Warren and Mr. Buttigieg has confirmed that the race is entering a new phase, as Mr. Biden struggles to regain momentum and Mr. Sanders attempts to expand his base beyond his core supporters. \u201cThe Sanders people are mostly the same people that were Sanders people in 2016, but there seem to be fewer of them,\u201d said JoAnn Hardy, the Democratic Party chairwoman in Cerro Gordo County, Iowa. \u201cSome of them have moved on to other campaigns, not necessarily all to Warren. Warren has a wider supporter base than just former Bernie supporters.\u201d Mr. Buttigieg himself declared the contest to be a \u201ctwo-way race\u201d in an interview with the Showtime television show \u201cThe Circus,\u201d a comment that irked several others in the presidential race. \u201cAnybody who thinks that this is a two-person race right now doesn\u2019t know Iowa,\u201d former Housing Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro told reporters Saturday. For months Mr. Biden led polls in Iowa, but he has seen his support steadily shrink as other candidates have focused their time and attention on the state. [Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter.] \u201cSome of the early Biden support was name recognition, some was familiarity, some was affection and respect,\u201d said Kurt Meyer, the Democratic Party chairman of Mitchell County, Iowa. \u201cBut much of it had to be renewed and extended, much as one would renew a thick book at the local library, for it to last until early February.\u201d That has left many of the remaining 13 candidates scrambling for attention, relevance and desperately needed campaign dollars. Much of the debate among the quartet of top contenders this weekend centered around Ms. Warren\u2019s long-awaited, $20.5 trillion proposal explaining how she would fund \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d which she released on Friday. Mr. Biden on Saturday bristled at Ms. Warren\u2019s suggestion that he was borrowing Republican talking points about her health care proposal, while at the same time accusing her of peddling plans that have no chance of being enacted as law. \u201cTo say that you\u2019re a Republican or you\u2019re not loyal or you have no courage if you don\u2019t agree with such and such a position is no way to get anything passed, I promise you,\u201d Mr. Biden told reporters after speaking at a fish fry hosted by first-term Representative Abby Finkenauer. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t even get it passed. You have to be able to reach out.\u201d For Ms. Warren, the weekend marked the beginning of a crucial stretch during which she would be compelled to sell her new plan to voters. Though not all of her supporters had familiarized themselves with the details on Saturday morning, many seemed inclined to give her the benefit of the doubt. \u201cShe is passionate about what she\u2019s saying,\u201d said Renee Lapan-Islas, 50, who came to see Ms. Warren speak in Vinton, Iowa. \u201cWe struggle for money at times because of health care.\u201d But Ms. Warren also faced a skeptical question from a voter with Type 1 diabetes, who expressed concern about the continuity of care under Ms. Warren\u2019s proposed transition to \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d \u201cHealth care is a basic human right, and we fight for basic human rights,\u201d Ms. Warren said, adding that the approach was \u201cabout strengthening America\u2019s middle class\u201d and arguing that failing to dramatically overhaul the health care system would be calamitous over the long haul. At the fish fry, which drew the race\u2019s seven leading candidates to a Cedar Rapids racetrack that has become a regular stop on the Democratic presidential campaign trail, the candidates parried question about rural infrastructure, river flooding and labor rights \u2014 the sort of bread-and-butter issues Ms. Finkenauer used last year to oust a Republican incumbent. Ms. Finkenauer\u2019s mother baked 750 cupcakes, which were heartily consumed by activists, campaign staffers and the assembled press. Other candidates, too, recognized the new order. Mr. Biden declared Ms. Warren\u2019s health care proposal to be divisive. Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado and Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana denigrated the population of South Bend as relatively insignificant. The weekend began with the Liberty & Justice Celebration, a party dinner seen as the last major candidate gathering before the caucuses. While 13 candidates spoke, only about half drew any kind of notable support and, of those, Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Warren were the only ones to draw thunderous applause from their speeches. The weekend marked the latest public test of each campaign\u2019s organizational prowess. The campaigns purchase tickets for the Friday night dinner, hoping to pack the hall with their supporters. Instead of rallying supporters for his speech, Mr. Sanders led a march that his campaign said attracted 1,500 people in the Des Moines drizzle. His aides said the campaign focused on organizing volunteers for the February caucus rather than a visible demonstration of enthusiasm inside the arena. Mr. Biden hosted no such demonstration: Before the event began, allies of Mr. Biden quietly collected signs and noisemakers that had been placed out for supporters who never arrived. At the end of his remarks, Mr. Biden asked the audience to \u201cget up\u201d and defeat President Trump. Nearly everyone remained seated.",

      "author": "Sydney Ember",
      "content": " Senator Bernie Sanders and his advisers were not anxious before the first three televised primary debates, confident in his ability to champion his ideas and dubious that the debates would dramatically change how voters regarded him. But his aides know the next debate will be different: When he takes the stage on Tuesday night, two weeks after suffering a heart attack, he will have to convince voters that he is strong enough to carry the party\u2019s challenge to President Trump next fall. Since he experienced chest pains on Oct. 1 at an event in Las Vegas and had two stents inserted to clear a blocked artery, Mr. Sanders, 78, has remained off the campaign trail, first recovering at a hospital and then at his home in Burlington, Vt. News that his campaign had waited several days to reveal his diagnosis of a heart attack \u2014 and the limited medical details that they have released since \u2014 has also raised questions of transparency and contributed to speculation about his condition. His campaign has not made his doctors available for interviews, and while Mr. Sanders has pledged to release his medical records, he has not yet done so. His health issues have cast a degree of uncertainty over his campaign and left his aides rushing to reassure voters about his age and health, just as he was trying to improve his standing in a race that in recent weeks has become more of a two-person contest between Senator Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. But if debates are an endurance test for all candidates, Tuesday\u2019s event has now taken on new urgency for Mr. Sanders, as he seeks to dispel doubts and show a national audience that he is physically capable of competing for the Democratic nomination. \u201cHe\u2019s got to step back onto the stage and show that he\u2019s vigorous and healthful,\u201d said Mark Longabaugh, a Democratic strategist who worked for Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign in 2016 but left his team earlier this year. \u201cI think he has only one objective in this debate, and that\u2019s just to show that he\u2019s healthy.\u201d Mr. Sanders has been preparing for the debate at his home in Burlington, where he has largely followed his typical pre-debate playbook: Rather than conducting intensive drills and mock debates \u2014 which he and his team generally do not view as productive given how many candidates will be onstage \u2014 Mr. Sanders has been having conversations with his close advisers, including his wife, Jane Sanders, about policy and his record. At Mr. Sanders\u2019s insistence, however, much of his debate preparations this time have occurred outdoors, in his backyard, according to a campaign official. He has alternated between sitting and standing, and during breaks, he has gone for walks or batted around a baseball to build up his endurance. Aides have said they expect Mr. Sanders to come across as energetic as ever and have rebuffed questions about whether he can handle standing for so long onstage. But they also allow that Mr. Sanders, his health and his appearance will be under intense scrutiny. (During the last debate, he struggled with a hoarse voice.) His team expects the topic of his heart attack to come up at the debate and anticipates he will be asked about it by the moderators. Mike Casca, a spokesman for the Sanders campaign, said in a statement that Mr. Sanders \u201cwill do what he\u2019s always done\u201d at the debate. \u201cI promise the pressure of doing right by the working class on Tuesday night is bigger than any boring conventional wisdom about the importance of his \u2018performance\u2019 pushed by political pundits in D.C.,\u201d Mr. Casca said. He added that \u201cthe solidarity forged over the last two weeks is going to make his coalition stronger.\u201d Several staff members, almost verbatim, have said the episode, though initially concerning, has empowered them with a new feeling of resolve, heightening the sense of unity. \u201cMore grateful than ever to be part of the @BernieSanders movement and family,\u201d Josh Orton, a senior adviser, wrote on Twitter on Saturday. Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign recently said it had raised $25.3 million between July and September, more than any other candidate, which has also helped buoy morale. Officials describe the strategy going forward as business as usual. The campaign has continued to release policy plans, including one on Monday aimed at \u201ccorporate greed and corruption\u201d that proposes giving workers 45 percent of the seats on their corporate boards. While Mr. Sanders recovers, an army of surrogates has fanned out across the country to make his case for him. Last week, he released a seven-minute, direct-to-supporter video reaffirming his commitment to his political revolution and to overcoming adversity. He has promised to continue his fight, especially for his signature policy proposal, \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d Campaign leaders have been providing campaign updates and rallying staffers on conference calls. The campaign is also attempting to portray his return to the campaign trail as a comeback story, and will hold a \u201cBernie\u2019s Back\u201d rally next weekend in New York City. To the extent he has talked about his heart trouble, he has framed it as a common medical episode that many people have experienced. \u201cPeople are back on their feet pretty soon, as is the case with me,\u201d he said in an interview that aired on ABC News on Sunday. In that interview he also drew an explicit contrast to Ms. Warren, a tactic he has mostly avoided. \u201cElizabeth, I think, as you know, has said that she is a capitalist through her bones. I\u2019m not,\u201d he said in response to a question about what he would say to voters who might prefer Ms. Warren, his chief ideological rival, because she is younger and did not just have a heart attack. His campaign, though eager to highlight how Mr. Sanders differs philosophically from Ms. Warren, said the comment did not reflect a broader change in strategy. Yet despite his campaign\u2019s projection of optimism, the episode has also exposed the uncertain nature over this next phase of his candidacy. Speaking to reporters last week, Mr. Sanders, who was known for keeping a grueling schedule on the campaign trail, said he intended to \u201cchange the nature\u201d of his campaign, holding fewer events than he had previously. But aides immediately downplayed his remarks and by the next day, Mr. Sanders told NBC News that he had \u201cmisspoke\u201d when he implied he would be slowing his pace and vowed to \u201cget back into the groove of a very vigorous campaign.\u201d Several staffers, however, said they were relieved he would be reducing the number of events, even if the slowdown was only temporary.",

      "author": "Maggie Astor",
      "content": "  Less than two months ago, Michael R. Bloomberg told a PBS interviewer that he probably couldn\u2019t win a Democratic primary, and that entering the race as late as November would be \u201cpretty hard.\u201d Well, it\u2019s November now, and he seems to have changed his mind. Here\u2019s a look at what happened on the campaign trail this week. Mr. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, filed paperwork on Friday to put his name on the ballot for the Democratic primary in Alabama. According to his advisers, he has not definitively decided to run for president, but the paperwork was necessary to keep the possibility alive, because Friday was Alabama\u2019s filing deadline. Arkansas and New Hampshire have deadlines next week, and Team Bloomberg says it plans to meet those, too. If Mr. Bloomberg does enter the race, it will bring the Democratic field back to 18 candidates, the largest ever. For the past week or so, it was merely tied with the 2016 Republican field. Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s flirtation with running is part of a larger backlash to Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s continuing strength in the race \u2014 and a vote of no confidence in former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s ability to unite moderate Democrats against her. As she has cemented herself at or near the top of the polls, Ms. Warren has drawn particular vitriol from Wall Street, where some executives have already announced that they will support Mr. Bloomberg if he runs. In a Medium post this week, Mr. Biden cast Ms. Warren as an \u201celitist\u201d who takes a \u201c\u2018my way or the highway\u2019 approach to politics.\u201d And Leon Cooperman, the billionaire investor who complained recently about what he called Ms. Warren\u2019s \u201cvilification of the rich,\u201d endorsed Mr. Bloomberg. Thanks to six polls released since we last wrote, Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii has qualified for the next debate (Nov. 20), and Senators Kamala Harris of California and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota have qualified for the one after that (Dec. 19). That means 10 candidates are in for November, and six so far for December. We also learned this week that the December debate will no longer be held at the University of California, Los Angeles, because of a dispute between the university and its largest employee union. The union has called for a boycott of speaking engagements on campus. It will instead take place at Loyola Marymount University, also in Los Angeles. While President Trump\u2019s approval rating is very low, and he trails most of his potential Democratic challengers in national polls, he appears stronger in the states that will decide the election, according to a new set of polls from The New York Times and Siena College. In the six closest states that went Republican in 2016, he trails Mr. Biden among registered voters, but is deadlocked with Senator Bernie Sanders and leads Ms. Warren. Pat Murphy, the Iowa political director for Tom Steyer, resigned after reports that he had offered campaign contributions to local Iowa candidates if they endorsed Mr. Steyer. The campaign said no contributions had actually been made. \u201cOur campaign policy is clear that we will not engage in this kind of activity, or any kind of communication that could be perceived as improper,\u201d Mr. Steyer\u2019s campaign manager, Heather Hargreaves, said in a statement on Friday announcing Mr. Murphy\u2019s resignation. \u201cViolation of this policy is not tolerated.\u201d Mr. Sanders unveiled his immigration plan on Thursday, pledging to use executive action if Congress does not pass comprehensive legislation. He said that on the first day of his presidency, he would reverse President Trump\u2019s immigration policies, including the denial of asylum claims and the \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy that has led to family separations. He also vowed to halt all deportations \u201cuntil a thorough audit of current and past practices and policies is complete.\u201d More broadly, he called for ending deportations of people who have been in the United States for more than five years, creating a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, expanding the DACA program and making unauthorized immigration a civil, not criminal, offense. Ms. Warren has wholeheartedly embraced attacks from Wall Street, and on Thursday, she took it one step further: Her campaign released a \u201ccalculator for the billionaires.\u201d \u201cSome billionaires seem confused about how much they would pay under Elizabeth\u2019s Ultra-Millionaire Tax,\u201d it says. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, now we have a calculator for that too.\u201d",

Bloomberg is poised to enter a race that has many voters anxious and searching for the perfect candidate.

      "author": "Sydney Ember",
      "content": "  COUNCIL BLUFFS, Iowa \u2014 Jackie Wellman worries that Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are too liberal to defeat President Trump, thinks Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., may be too inexperienced and, while she is fond of Joseph R. Biden Jr., she is also uneasy about his tendency to misspeak. \u201cI am worried about the top four candidates because they all have issues,\u201d said Ms. Wellman, a 54-year-old Iowa caucusgoer from West Des Moines who likes Senator Amy Klobuchar. Ms. Wellman is not the only Democrat who keeps finding flaws as she searches for the best candidate to win the White House. \u201cVoters are holding back because just when they start to fall in love, they find something that gets them a little nervous,\u201d former Mayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago said. \u201cThe reason it\u2019s so fluid is because they\u2019re still searching for the horse that can win.\u201d\n\nMichael R. Bloomberg believes that may be him. But Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s apparent decision to mount a late entry into the presidential race represents something more than just the robust self-confidence of a New York City billionaire; it\u2019s a manifestation of the Democratic angst that has been growing, particularly among moderate voters and party establishment figures. Mr. Bloomberg has jolted the Democratic primary, drawing fire from the leading liberals in the field who said he was trying to buy the presidency while posing a direct threat to the centrist candidacy of Mr. Biden. But he has also exposed the jitters among establishment-aligned Democrats who fear that the leftward turn of the party is endangering their chances of building a winning coalition.\n\nFor weeks, senior Democratic officials and donors have been musing about whether a new candidate could be lured in the race, a striking illustration of nervousness just three months before the Iowa caucuses. Some talked up Mr. Bloomberg and Hillary Clinton, but others wondered if Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio might make a late entry to unite a party splintered along ideological lines. And while some party leaders have muted their concerns in an effort to be neutral, that restraint has started to give way to open expressions of alarm. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has been repeating the same mantra \u2014 \u201cRemember November\u201d \u2014 in private about focusing on winning the general election, and has told Democratic allies she was uneasy about a nominee running on Medicare for all. In an interview last week with Bloomberg News, the San Francisco-based speaker let her concerns slip, saying that creating government-run health care \u201cwould increase the vote in my own district, but that\u2019s not what we need to do in order to win the Electoral College.\u201d Many voters are just as uneasy. \u201cI like Elizabeth Warren,\u201d said Janet Mayo-Smith, 64, who was attending an event for Mr. Biden in Franklin, N.H., on Friday, before adding that she had concerns about whether Ms. Warren was too \u201cradical\u201d to win. She expressed some openness to Mr. Bloomberg, calling him \u201ca good candidate\u201d but also noting that it was late to join the race. Stanley Brown, 49, also from New Hampshire,  called Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s move \u201cinteresting.\u2019\u2019 Asked if there were too many voices in the race already, he replied \u201cno such thing.\u2019\u2019 \u201cI\u2019d consider anybody,\u201d he said. Yet if there is consensus around the high priority of finding the strongest candidate to take on Mr. Trump, there is less agreement among rank-and-file voters that the party needs a white knight to enter the race and rescue them. Interviews with Democrats across four states on Friday showed that many were content to pick from those who remained in the sprawling field. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what his logic is exactly,\u201d Ricky Hurtado, who attended a Hispanic voters forum in North Carolina that featured Ms. Warren, said of Mr. Bloomberg. Ticking through a number of the leading Democrats in the race, Mr. Hurtado, who is running for the state legislature next year, said, \u201cI think we have enough voices in the primary right now covering the majority of the spectrum in the Democratic Party.\u201d In New Hampshire, where Mr. Biden and the businessman Andrew Yang were at the statehouse on a frosty day, filing paperwork to be on the state\u2019s primary ballot, voters mostly shrugged about Mr. Bloomberg, who on Friday filed paperwork to qualify for the Alabama primary. A few groused about a bloated field getting bigger. Carolyn Stiles, 75, said she worried that such a large field would make it difficult for Democrats to unify behind one candidate, and described Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s potential entrance into the race as \u201cunhelpful.\u201d She said she was considering Mr. Biden, Ms. Warren and Senator Kamala Harris. To some center-left Democratic candidates in the race, though, a Bloomberg bid could prove more than unhelpful. Were he to finance a major advertising campaign, he could siphon support, news media attention and ultimately votes from the more moderate candidates, clearing a path for Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren. \u201cI don\u2019t know who he hurts but it\u2019s not going to be Bernie or Elizabeth,\u201d said Senator Amy Klobuchar, who is hoping to establish herself in Iowa as a centrist alternative to Mr. Biden. \u201cWe don\u2019t need another billionaire,\u201d she added. Representative Cedric Richmond of Louisiana, a co-chair of Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign, was even blunter. \u201cIt takes a whole lot of moxie to look at the Democratic field and say, \u2018None of them can be president and I\u2019ll enter the race and be the savior,\u2019\u201d Mr. Richmond said. \u201cWhat does Bloomberg offer that\u2019s different? It\u2019s not like he\u2019s 27 \u2014 he\u2019s 77.\u201d Mr. Bloomberg may not prove to be the tonic the party is looking for. His record on policing and economic issues, and his skepticism about the #MeToo movement, could alienate large swaths of the Democratic electorate. And he is choosing an unconventional path in the primary; his advisers signaled Friday that if he runs he\u2019s unlikely to compete in the first four states. But it is clear enough why he is tempted to run. Mr. Biden\u2019s unsteady performances in debates and on the campaign trail have undermined confidence in his ability to beat the president. They have hurt Mr. Biden\u2019s fund-raising and early-state polling while exacerbating what may be his biggest liability \u2014 that at 76, he may not be nimble enough to beat an unpredictable figure like Mr. Trump. Mr. Buttigieg is gaining support in Iowa, but polls show he has yet to draw any sizable support from nonwhite Democrats. On the other flank of the party, Democrats are eyeing Mr. Sanders, a 78-year-old democratic socialist who just suffered a heart attack, and Ms. Warren, who is tightening her embrace around a pricey single-payer health care proposal that would terminate private insurance plans. Both candidates have large and devoted followings, but Democrats have not put forward avowedly liberal presidential nominees in decades; a new New York Times/Siena College poll showing Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders losing to Mr. Trump in some battleground states only further frayed nerves. \u201cThat frightened a lot of people,\u201d Terry McAuliffe, the former governor of Virginia and D.N.C. chair, said of the survey. Then came Tuesday\u2019s elections, in which Democrats had great success with mostly moderate candidates who posted large margins in suburban jurisdictions \u2014 heightening the conviction among many that the party needed a centrist standard-bearer. Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s prospective run has mostly agitated Mr. Biden\u2019s supporters, who were already on edge over his fund-raising troubles, his dip in the polls in Iowa and Mr. Trump\u2019s unrelenting assault on him and his son Hunter.\n\n \u201cI don\u2019t like that,\u201d Marge Cudney, who came to celebrate Mr. Biden\u2019s filing for the New Hampshire primary, said of Mr. Bloomberg. \u201cHe\u2019s going to divide the team and will weaken everybody. I think he could pull some people away.\u201d Yet two former lawmakers who are supporting Mr. Biden \u2014 Ed Rendell of Pennsylvania and Bob Kerrey, a former senator and governor of Nebraska \u2014 spoke favorably about Mr. Bloomberg and said they would be comfortable with him as a candidate if Mr. Biden faltered. \u201cI\u2019m for Joe,\u201d Mr. Rendell said, \u201cbut if something were to happen where Joe was no longer a candidate, which I don\u2019t believe is going to happen, I would enthusiastically consider the mayor as a good strong candidate, and I think he\u2019d make a fine president.\u201d And not every voter dismissed Mr. Bloomberg, whose advisers believe will be viewed more favorably once Democrats nationally become more familiar with his business career and record as mayor. Bryant Tolles, 80, of Concord, N.H., gave Mr. Bloomberg high marks for his political experience. \u201cI\u2019m glad he entered the race,\u201d said Mr. Tolles, who is undecided, adding, \u201cThey need another centrist who can appeal to the broad electorate.\u201d For all the heartburn in a party that is often given to indigestion about its presidential field, polls show that Democrats are generally pleased with their options. In a Monmouth University poll released this week, roughly three-quarters of Democratic voters said they were satisfied with the field, while just 16 percent said they were not. Moderate and conservative Democrats were more likely to say they wished someone new would get in the race, but only 22 percent of them expressed discontent with their choices. What is more revealing is how many in the party are not yet settled on a candidate: The Times/Siena poll of Iowa, where voters are paying closest attention to the race, found that roughly two-thirds of likely caucusgoers could still be persuaded to change their minds.\n\nThe ranks of the undecided include Alan Seabrooke, 89, of Elgin, Iowa, who said, \u201cIf you get somebody too far to the left, it scares people.\u201d Alex Stroda, a 40-year-old from Ottumwa, Iowa, who called himself a \u201cleftist libertarian,\u201d was just as concerned about 2020 but for the opposite reason: He thinks too many of the candidates are not progressive enough. Mr. Stroda, a former vice chair of the Wapello County Democrats, who is considering Mr. Sanders, Ms. Warren and Mr. Yang, dismissed the logic behind a Bloomberg candidacy. \u201cThis notion that he needs to ride in on a white horse and save the Democratic Party from somebody who is too left-wing,\u201d he said, \u201cis just an extension of the problem we have understanding politics in America, where we have the Democrats tacking to the right as the Republicans tack farther and farther right.\u201d",

      "content": " WESTERVILLE, Ohio \u2014 Representative Ilhan Omar endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont for the Democratic presidential nomination on Tuesday, and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez will endorse Mr. Sanders at a rally this weekend, according to his campaign. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York and a star of the progressive left, will join Mr. Sanders at his \u201cBernie\u2019s Back\u201d rally in Queens on Saturday. Earlier Tuesday, his campaign had teased that Mr. Sanders would have a \u201cspecial guest\u201d at the event. News of the endorsements came as the Democratic presidential candidates were wrapping up their appearances in the fourth debate of the primary season. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s planned endorsement was first reported by The Washington Post. The endorsements, which come just two weeks after Mr. Sanders suffered a heart attack in Las Vegas, are likely to provide a much-needed boost to Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign. They could also serve to quell some concerns about his health and his age. \u201cBernie is leading a working-class movement to defeat Donald Trump that transcends generation, ethnicity and geography,\u201d Ms. Omar, Democrat of Minnesota, said in a statement. She cited the bill she and Mr. Sanders introduced in June to cancel all of the country\u2019s student debt, worth about $1.6 trillion, and praised him for working to end foreign wars. \u201cI believe Bernie Sanders is the best candidate to take on Donald Trump in 2020,\u201d she said. In his own statement, Mr. Sanders called Ms. Omar \u201ca leader of strength and courage.\u201d Mr. Sanders, 78, has been recovering since his heart attack, first at a hospital and then at his home in Burlington, Vt. The debate on Tuesday night in Westerville, Ohio, just outside of Columbus, was his first appearance before a national audience since the episode. Mr. Sanders\u2019s health issues have cast a degree of uncertainty over his campaign and left his aides rushing to reassure voters about his age and health, just as he was trying to improve his standing in a race that in recent weeks has become more of a two-person contest between Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. Asked about his health directly at the debate on Tuesday night, Mr. Sanders nodded to the rally and to the \u201cspecial guest.\u201d \u201cLet me invite you all to a major rally we\u2019re having in Queens,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a special guest at that event, and we are going to be mounting a vigorous campaign all over this country.\u201d He also said, \u201cI\u2019m feeling great.\u201d Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign is billing the New York rally as his official return to the campaign trail. It had toyed with holding the rally in Prospect Park in Brooklyn, according to an aide, but settled on a park in Queens, with a backdrop of the Manhattan skyline. Presidential endorsements from the congresswomen, both members of the group of first-term Democratic women of color known as \u201cthe squad,\u201d were highly coveted. In addition to being among the country\u2019s most prominent progressives, the members of the group \u2014 Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, Ms. Omar, Representative Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Representative Ayanna S. Pressley of Massachusetts \u2014  have also become some of President Trump\u2019s favorite foils. Assorted news reports said that Ms. Tlaib planned to endorse Mr. Sanders as well, and early Wednesday Ms. Omar tweeted that Ms. Tlaib was backing him. Ms. Tlaib\u2019s team did not respond to requests for comment, and Mr. Sanders\u2019s aides did not confirm that Ms. Tlaib had endorsed him. In a statement, an aide to Ms. Pressley said: \u201cAyanna has tremendous respect for her sisters-in-service. Ultimately, these political decisions are made as individuals. Ayanna knows that taking back the White House in 2020 is a top priority, and she is working everyday to hold this Administration accountable.\u201d Last month, Ms. Warren won the endorsement of the Working Families Party, a progressive group that endorsed Mr. Sanders during the last presidential cycle. The endorsement was a boon to Ms. Warren\u2019s candidacy as she aimed to position herself as Mr. Biden\u2019s main rival and the standard-bearer for the progressive left. But it also unnerved supporters of Mr. Sanders, who criticized the endorsement process.",

      "author": "Jonathan Martin",
      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 Democrats in the country\u2019s most pivotal general election battlegrounds prefer a moderate presidential nominee who would seek common ground with Republicans rather than pursue an ambitious, progressive agenda, according to a New York Times/Siena College poll of primary voters across six states. As the Democratic candidates intensify their argument over how best to defeat President Trump, their core voters in Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Arizona and Florida are counseling them to pursue a political middle ground. A majority of those surveyed said they wanted a Democratic nominee who is more moderate than most Democrats, and they overwhelmingly preferred one who would bridge the partisan divide in Washington. The party\u2019s voters are more evenly split on the scale of change they are seeking from their nominee: 49 percent said they preferred a candidate who would return politics in Washington to normal, while 45 percent hope for one who will bring fundamental change to American society. The poll showed a top tier of three candidates in the battleground states: Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. Mr. Biden was leading in five of the six states, while Ms. Warren enjoyed a narrow advantage within the margin of error in Wisconsin, where Mr. Sanders also appeared strong. No other candidate registered in double digits in any of the states surveyed. While Democrats have unambiguously moved to the left in the decade since President Barack Obama took office, as Republicans eagerly point out, the poll illustrates that the party\u2019s identity is more complex than the opposition and some progressive activists would portray it. Democratic voters in the six states, each of which Mr. Trump carried three years ago, are split almost equally in how they described themselves ideologically: 49 percent say they are moderate or conservative, while 48 percent indicate they are very liberal or somewhat liberal. And this presidential primary reflects the party\u2019s contrasting impulses. Primary voters who long for a moderate standard-bearer and a return to normalcy in Washington strongly prefer Mr. Biden, according to the survey. Those Democrats who prefer a progressive nominee and want them to fight for a bold agenda while bringing systemic change to American society are nearly evenly divided between Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren. The divisions go beyond ideology and ambition: Older, nonwhite Democrats and those without college degrees strongly favor Mr. Biden. But younger Democrats of all races prefer Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders, while those with college degrees overwhelmingly prefer Ms. Warren. None of the six states where voters were polled are casting ballots in the first stage of the primary next year, and only North Carolina votes on Super Tuesday, in early March, immediately after the initial early-voting states. So the candidate preferences could change by the time these states hold their nominating contests. The Times/Siena survey of 1,568 Democratic primary voters in the six states was conducted from Oct. 13 to 26. It has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2.8 percentage points. Sampling error in individual states is higher. In preferences for individual candidates, the major distinction between the six states and Iowa, where The Times and Siena polled caucusgoers late last month, is that Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., is in the top tier with Ms. Warren, Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders in Iowa. But he has scant support in the battleground states and despite winning a wave of attention in recent months, he was one of several candidates to poll at zero percent among black voters in those states. The ideological and generational divisions shaping this primary are strikingly similar in the Iowa and battleground surveys. Mr. Biden has nearly three times the support from voters over 65 that he does among those 29 and younger. And he does three times better among self-described moderates and conservatives than he does among those who say they are very liberal. The former vice president\u2019s support from older voters is especially pronounced among nonwhite Democrats. Nearly half of the racial minorities surveyed who were 45 and older backed Mr. Biden, while Mr. Sanders received 10 percent and Ms. Warren 9 percent. What\u2019s more ominous for Mr. Biden is that his support with younger nonwhite voters is far more tenuous: Among racial minorities under 45, Mr. Sanders was the favorite at 28 percent, followed by Ms. Warren at 19 percent and Mr. Biden at only 11 percent. Xiomara Alarcon, a 24-year-old postal worker from Greensboro, N.C., described Mr. Sanders as \u201cpure-hearted,\u201d a true-believing advocate for progressive policies like \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d She also approvingly noted that he was arrested as a young activist in 1963. \u201cHe fights for all people of color,\u201d said Ms. Alarcon, who identifies as Hispanic. \u201cNot just himself and his people.\u201d Among African-American voters of all ages in the six states, Mr. Biden was the overwhelming favorite, receiving 42 percent of that vote. Ms. Warren captured 13 percent, and Mr. Sanders had 10 percent. That finding aligns with other polling through the year that reinforces Mr. Biden\u2019s high standing with black voters, forged through ties with congressional and community leaders, and most significantly, through his relationship with former President Obama. \u201cHe was Obama\u2019s vice president and some of the things Obama supported, he supported,\u201d Michael Elliott, 61, of Jacksonville, Fla., said of Mr. Biden. \u201cVice president, that\u2019s as close as you can get to being a president. I\u2019m looking at experience, too.\u201d Nearly 300 miles down the Florida coast, William Stewart, 39, raised concerns about Mr. Biden\u2019s ability to appeal to younger voters and said he was currently supporting Ms. Warren. \u201cIt would be great for a woman to be president,\u201d said Mr. Stewart, of West Palm Beach. Mr. Stewart, a logistics manager, identifies as African-American. \u201cI believe in some of the thoughts she has about health care and equal rights for everybody.\u201d As for Mr. Biden, he said, \u201cI have a little reservation about if he\u2019s connecting with the younger people.\u201d Ms. Warren was strongest among voters who identified as \u201cvery liberal,\u201d winning 35 percent, while Mr. Biden captured just 13 percent of those voters. She also dominated with white college graduates, capturing 33 percent, far more than Mr. Biden or Mr. Sanders. Mr. Biden was strongest among white voters without a four-year degree, taking 30 percent \u2014 double Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders, who both captured 15 percent of these voters. \u201cJoe Biden has the experience,\u201d said Diane Ethridge, 60, of Green Bay, Wis. \u201cI also think he\u2019s more willing to listen and he will do far better with trade with this country, he will do far better, I think also even in the Democratic Party, with health care.\u201d Ms. Ethridge, who attended vocational school and worked at a phone company, said she opposed Medicare for all and efforts to make college free, proposals supported in various forms by Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders. \u201cShe\u2019s doing well in the polls,\u201d she said of Ms. Warren, \u201cbut I am not for her political platform of Medicare for all. I don\u2019t know where this money is going to be coming from. I am not in favor of education for all, either. I don\u2019t feel we should be paying for someone who could afford to pay for it.\u201d\n\nEven some of Ms. Warren\u2019s supporters expressed concerns about the practical and political considerations of her Medicare for all plan. Ms. Warren has said her proposal will not raise taxes on the middle class. Last Friday she unveiled a plan describing how she would pay for an initiative that she says would cost $20.5 trillion in new federal spending over a decade. \u201cI\u2019m very skeptical\u201d about the tax implications, Mr. Stewart, of Florida, said. \u201cThat\u2019s the only discrepancy. I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s possible.\u201d",

      "author": "Linda Qiu",
      "content": " Since Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont drove the idea of \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d or a single-payer health system, to the center of the political debate, few other issues have so divided the Democratic presidential candidates and voters. The result has been a cascade of competing assertions, estimates and statistics about the costs and effects of what would amount to a fundamental overhaul of the size and role of the government and the way Americans receive care. Here\u2019s a fact check of some of these claims. \u201cShe\u2019s making it up. Look, nobody thinks it\u2019s $20 trillion. It\u2019s between $30 trillion and $40 trillion, every major independent study that\u2019s gone out there that\u2019s taken a look at this\u201d \n\u2014 Joseph R. Biden Jr., in a November interview on PBS \u201cBernie has said that it will cost $31 trillion, he\u2019s come up with 16 of that $31 trillion, and that\u2019s half.\u201d\n\u2014 Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, in an October interview on CNN The Medicare for all proposal released by Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts last week would cost the federal government an additional $20.5 trillion over a decade, and she would fund it in large part through new taxes on business and the wealthy. Unlike Ms. Warren, Mr. Sanders has not committed to funding proposals, but he has released several \u201coptions to finance Medicare for all\u201d \u2014 characterized as discussion starters \u2014 that would generate about $16.2 trillion over 10 years. Mr. Biden and Mr. Bennet have a point that several major studies have found higher additional federal expenditures than Ms. Warren\u2019s estimate or Mr. Sanders\u2019 revenue options: $34 trillion over a decade, according to the liberal Urban Institute; $32.6 trillion, according to the conservative Mercatus Center; and $24.7 trillion, according to an estimate by Kenneth E. Thorpe, a health care economist at Emory University. And the RAND Corporation, a research group, projected an increase of $2.4 trillion in 2019 alone. \n\nBut lower estimates exist as well. A University of Massachusetts at Amherst study suggested the number was $13.5 trillion while Gerald Friedman, a health economist at the same university who did not contribute to that study, said that a single-payer system would need to come up with about $9.6 trillion more. Apart from examining different time frames, such diverging estimates result from the unpredictable nature of projecting how Medicare for all would work in practice. How much fees paid to doctors and hospitals, prescription drugs prices and administrative costs could be reduced \u2014 and how many more people would become insured and use health care services \u2014 will all affect a single-payer system\u2019s bottom line. Ms. Warren assumes, for example, cuts of 70 percent in prescription drug prices and 2.3 percent in administrative costs while the Urban Institute projected reductions of 40 percent in drug costs and 6 percent administrative costs. \u201cFirst of all, if we do nothing in terms of the health care, I think the estimate is, we will be spending as a nation $50 trillion.\u201d\n\u2014 Mr. Sanders, in an October interview on PBS The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services projects that under the current system, total health care spending, including both private insurance and government programs, will reach a little over $47 trillion from 2018 to 2027. But that number is not completely comparable to the $30-some trillion estimates for Medicare for all. That is because those estimates reflect federal government spending, not total health care spending, under Medicare for all. Mr. Sanders\u2019s broader point \u2014 that a such a system is less expensive than the status quo \u2014 is up for debate. The Urban Institute found that total health spending would reach $52 trillion from 2020 to 2029 under existing law versus $59 trillion under Medicare for all. The RAND Corporation estimated the status quo costing $3.8 trillion versus $3.9 trillion for single-payer in 2019. On the flip side, the University of Massachusetts study projected that national health expenditures would be $5.1 trillion lower over 10 years under Medicare for all. Mr. Friedman estimated $5.5 trillion to $12.5 trillion in savings. \u201cIf a fireman and a schoolteacher are making 100,000 bucks a year, their taxes are going to go up about 10 grand.\u201d\n\u2014 Mr. Biden, at a Democratic debate in October\n\n\u201cAnd he does that by taxing people that are making less than $30,000 a year.\u201d\n\u2014 Mr. Bennet, in the interview with CNN These statements refer to a 7.5 percent payroll tax and a 4 percent premium tax based on income, two financing mechanisms listed by Mr. Sanders. But these taxes are merely options. Moreover, the statements omit key details about how these potential taxes could work. A $7,500 payroll tax and a $4,000 premium tax for Mr. Biden\u2019s hypothetical household making $100,000 a year would still lower be than the $20,576 average annual family premium on employer-sponsored plans in 2019. (Employers picked up the bulk of the tab, $14,561 on average.) Economists generally agree that employers pass on the cost of health benefits to workers in the form of lower wages, and payroll taxes also come out of paychecks. So it is theoretically possible that under Medicare for all, a family would get a $20,000 raise as they and their employers no longer had to pay for premiums, while their additional health care taxes would amount to less than $20,000, said Gerard F. Anderson, a professor of health policy at Johns Hopkins University. \u201cBut it is also likely that the company would not give them a $20,000 raise,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile the average is $20,000, not everyone receives this in benefits. We simply cannot make that projection without a fully fleshed out financing plan.\u201d Under a single-payer plan, said Linda J. Blumberg of the Urban Institute, the wages for workers who currently do not receive employer-sponsored health care, however, may decrease. \u201cIt puts $11 trillion back in the pockets of American families, and doesn\u2019t raise taxes on the middle class by even a cent.\u201d\n\u2014 Ms. Warren, in a Twitter post in November\n\n\u201cThe average American will pay less for health care under Medicare for all.\u201d\n\u2014 Mr. Sanders, in the PBS interview Whereas Mr. Sanders has said taxes will increase for average families under Medicare for all and Ms. Warren has based her plan on a promise to avoid additional taxes on the middle class, their statements make a similar point: Most Americans would see savings under Medicare for all. But both of their claims require additional context. Ms. Warren does not include any middle-class tax increases in her plan but would charge employers a tax equal to 98 percent of what they were previously paying for employee health care. Unlike Mr. Sanders\u2019s suggested payroll tax, this tax is not proportional to workers\u2019 pay and thus would have regressive effects, Howard Gleckman of the Tax Policy Center and Matt Bruenig of the progressive People\u2019s Policy Project have argued. Since employers would essentially pay the same amount for health care under Ms. Warren\u2019s plan than under the status quo, that hypothetical household making $100,000 is also theoretically less likely to see a pay raise under the employer tax than under a payroll tax. (Nonetheless, Ms. Warren assumes that higher take-home pay is guaranteed, because employees would no longer be paying a share of health premiums or contributing to health savings accounts, and includes $1.15 trillion in additional tax revenue in her calculations.) While Mr. Sanders does not commit to specific financing mechanisms, those proposed by his 2016 campaign would leave the program $16.6 trillion short, according to the Urban Institute, raising the possibility of additional costs to families. Mr. Thorpe found that 72 percent of families would see savings under that 2016 plan. But when Mr. Thorpe modeled higher taxes to achieve a deficit-neutral plan, it resulted in 71 percent of families paying more. Other researchers have been more optimistic that finding ways to pay the full cost of the program and savings to families are both achievable. The University of Massachusetts study determined that low- and middle-income families would pay less for health care. Under Mr. Friedman\u2019s proposal, households with incomes of $30,000 to $130,000 would receive the greatest savings. \u201cGovernment programs \u2014 Medicaid and Medicare \u2014 don\u2019t pay the cost of health care. So if we only had those as our payers, most of the hospitals in this country would close because the reimbursement rates are too low to support the operations in the hospitals.\u201d\n\u2014 John Delaney, the former congressman from Maryland and a Democratic presidential candidate, in an October interview on C-SPAN A spokesman for Mr. Delaney cited three sources for his assertion: a report from the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services noting that two-thirds of hospitals lose money on Medicare services; a New York Times article on the financial toll Medicare for all would place on some hospitals, and Mr. Delaney\u2019s personal experiences visiting rural hospitals. While the evidence suggests that Medicare for all would adversely affect some hospitals, it does not prove Mr. Delaney\u2019s claim that \u201cmost\u201d in the United States would close under a single-payer system. The impact on hospitals also depends on what rates the new system would pay. If current reimbursement levels were maintained, annual revenue for hospitals could have a net decrease of 16 percent, or about $151 billion, in a Medicare for all system, estimated a 2019 article in JAMA; that could possibly lead to job losses of 800,000 to 1.5 million. Kevin Schulman, a physician and economist at Stanford University who helped write the article, cautioned that these findings did not reflect performance at individual hospitals. \u201cPredicting hospital closures from operating losses would be difficult because many hospitals have endowments that they can use to support themselves for some period of time despite a financial loss,\u201d he said. \u201cHospitals that do not have endowments would be at greater risk, but may still be able to operate despite financial losses.\u201d And if Medicare for all were phased in over time, the impact would be more blunted. \u201cThe hospitals would revise their cost structures,\u201d said Sherry Glied, a health economist at New York University. \u201cThat means that they would probably reduce some staffing \u2014 both administrative and clinical \u2014 slow investments in new technology, and stop building marble-paneled lobbies. Would that be terrible? Not sure.\u201d Moreover, a Medicare for all system would more likely pay hospitals at higher rates than current Medicare levels, said Mr. Anderson of Johns Hopkins. As an example, he pointed to Washington State\u2019s public option, which pays 60 percent more than Medicare rates. Legislation introduced in the House replaces existing Medicare payments with a new negotiated lump sum for each provider. Ms. Warren proposes to pay hospitals at about 10 percent more than current Medicare rates. \u201cUnder my Administration, Medicare Advantage premiums next year will be their lowest in the last 13 years. We are providing GREAT healthcare to our Seniors. We cannot let the radical socialists take that away through Medicare for All!\u201d \n\u2014 President Trump, in a tweet in October Medicare Advantage is a private alternative to traditional Medicare, run by companies but funded with government subsidies. They cover the same services as Medicare and often additional benefits. About a third of Medicare enrollees opt for this type of plan. Though Mr. Sanders\u2019s legislation would eliminate Medicare Advantage, current enrollees would receive more benefits under a single-payer system \u2014 contrary to Mr. Trump\u2019s suggestion that they would lose their coverage. On average, Medicare Advantage premiums cost $29 a month while Mr. Sanders\u2019s plan eliminates premiums and covers dental, vision and long-term care and hearing aids.

      "content": " The large field of Democrats running for president may have differing views on the best way to provide health care to the masses or exactly how to reform the immigration system. But when it comes to helping America\u2019s veterans they largely agree: The Department of Veterans Affairs needs some serious help, and those who have served need much better access to benefits, health care, housing, education and jobs. On Veterans Day, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont released extensive plans outlining how they would help them. They follow a similarly detailed proposal unveiled last week by Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and they join a lengthy list of policy plans released by candidates throughout the summer and fall. Here\u2019s a closer look at the measures Democrats are calling for, and how their proposals contrast with what President Trump has already done. Almost every candidate agrees that the V.A. needs to be able to function better than it currently does and has pledged to give the agency the resources it needs to work efficiently. Mr. Buttigieg, Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren are among those who have called for the agency to fill its more than 49,000 staffing vacancies. Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders, among others, have said they would invest in modernizing V.A. hospitals, clinics and other infrastructure. And in a commonly heard refrain, several Democrats have promised to eliminate the perennial \u201cbenefits backlog\u201d that forces tens of thousands of veterans to wait for a determination on the benefits they can receive. Mr. Buttigieg, a former Navy intelligence officer who served in Afghanistan, proposes making the V.A. apolitical \u201cby appointing leaders with relevant expertise and ensuring continuity in leadership across administrations.\u201d And in an interview with The Associated Press on Monday, he said he\u2019d seek to name a woman to head the agency for the first time. \u201cI think leadership plays a huge role, so, absolutely I\u2019d seek to name a woman to lead V.A.,\u201d he said. Several candidates have promised that under their administrations, veterans would get access to affordable and comprehensive health care. Under that umbrella, candidates like Mr. Sanders have specifically promised to guarantee dental care, expand the V.A.\u2019s comprehensive caregiver program and other measures. Multiple candidates also have called attention to veteran suicide and pledged to invest in research, mental health services and housing to help address the issue. Ms. Warren has said she would aim to reduce the number of veteran suicides by 50 percent within her first term. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey suggested appointing a White House official solely focused on working across agencies to cut the suicide rate. Senator Kamala Harris of California, meanwhile, is among those who have called for expanding access to health care and housing assistance for veterans with \u201cother-than-honorable\u201d discharges, which they may have received because they experienced trauma or other reasons beyond their control. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and other candidates have also outlined ways to support veterans once they re-enter civilian life. For instance, Ms. Klobuchar has proposed extending G.I. Bill education benefits to members of the National Guard and Reserve and implementing a grant program that would invest in veteran education centers. Several candidates have also said they would expand and improve incentives for companies to hire veterans, and that they would direct government agencies to invest in more veteran-owned businesses and entrepreneurship. The entrepreneur Andrew Yang has argued for what he calls a \u201creverse boot camp\u201d which would seek to help veterans adjust to life after the military by training them in skills like cooking, financial literacy and how to interview for a job. Candidates also promised to rescind Mr. Trump\u2019s ban on transgender servicemembers, stand up for victims of sexual assault in the military and protect veterans and family members of servicemembers from deportation. Ms. Warren has called the ban on transgender servicemembers \u201cshameful.\u201d And Mr. Buttigieg said his administration would reach out to people who were discharged because of their gender identity and give them a chance to re-enlist. Ms. Klobuchar said in her proposal that more than 20,000 servicemembers were sexually assaulted in 2018. She and other Democrats have proposed various ways to strengthen the prosecution of perpetrators and expand access to counseling for victims. In her plan, Ms. Warren noted that protections from deportation for veterans have been eroding under the Trump administration, and pledged to restart a program that makes it easier for noncitizens who serve to become naturalized. Mr. Trump, who kicked off the 100th annual New York City Veterans Day Parade in Manhattan on Monday, has also sought to court veterans, a group he views as a key piece of his political base. Public polls have found that Mr. Trump\u2019s support among veterans outpaces his support from the public at large. He has garnered praise from some veterans for railing against \u201cendless wars,\u201d much like the 2020 Democratic candidate Representative Tulsi Gabbard, a major in the Hawaii Army National Guard who has served two combat tours in the Middle East. Mr. Trump campaigned in 2016 on wanting to put more veterans in private health care. To help accomplish that goal, Congress passed health care legislation known as the Mission Act in 2018 and the V.A. rolled out new rules this year that allowed a broad group of enrollees to seek care outside the agency. Though Mr. Trump has heralded the program as great success, it has struggled to grow its network of doctors to meet coverage demands. For all his talk of supporting veterans, Mr. Trump has also sometimes snubbed them.He admitted in court documents that he gave his campaign control over how to spend $2.8 million that his charity raised through what was ostensibly a fund-raiser for veterans. Last year, he chose to forgo a traditional visit to Arlington National Cemetery on Veterans Day, a decision that led him to issue a rare apology. He drew wide condemnation during the 2016 campaign when he criticized the parents of a slain soldier who had denounced him, and he frequently attacked the late Senator John McCain, saying the former Navy pilot and prisoner of war was \u201cnot a war hero.\u201d ",

      "author": "Lisa Lerer",
      "content": " Hi, and welcome to a special post-debate edition of On Politics. I\u2019m Lisa Lerer, your host. Yesterday afternoon, when our benevolent politics editor Patrick Healy asked what I expected to hear at the debate last night, I shot back full of confidence and that classic political reporter swagger. Pile on Pete. Duh. The question, I argued, wasn\u2019t whether the candidates would go after Pete Buttigieg but how he\u2019d deal with the flood of attacks on his policies, lack of experience and inability to win over voters of color. Well, dear readers, revoke my conventional wisdom card right now. I was wrong. Really wrong. Last night\u2019s debate was notable more for what didn\u2019t happen that what did: The South Bend mayor skated. Coming into the debate, there were several leading candidates who needed to do something to try to slow Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s momentum. Others, like Senators Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey, could have benefited from taking a shot at a top-tier candidate, particularly one who has struggled to connect with black voters. No one did anything to stop his rise. Sure, there were a handful of attacks. Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii went after Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s record on foreign policy, a charge he deflected by launching into a broadside on Ms. Gabbard\u2019s much-derided meeting with the President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, a \u201cmurderous dictator.\u201d Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota went after Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s background, questioning whether his experience as mayor of South Bend, Ind., \u2014 a city of about 100,000 people \u2014 makes him ready for the White House. \u201cThere\u2019s more than 100 years of Washington experience on this stage, and where are we right now as a country?\u201d Mr. Buttigieg fired back. And Ms. Harris, who has continued her slide in the polls, whiffed her attack over his campaign website\u2019s use of a stock photo from Kenya to illustrate his plan to combat racism in the United States. Mr. Buttigieg responded by talking about his history leading a \u201cracially diverse city\u201d and as a gay man. Of course, a good night hardly means Mr. Buttigieg is unstoppable. His weakness with voters of color, which is evident in tons of polls, is a real problem. No Democrat in recent political history has won the party\u2019s presidential nomination without the support of black voters. But Mr. Buttigieg, who has opened a lead in Iowa in recent polling, is hoping a victory there can help him win over skeptical voters in the more diverse primaries that follow. There\u2019s no indication anyone on that stage last night took steps to sow the kinds of doubts that would stop him from moving forward with his plan. Or his momentum. Plenty of other stuff happened last night, too! Here\u2019s some of what we were watching. The candidates touched on a number of topics that hadn\u2019t really been explored in the past four debates: paid family leave, affordable housing and the potential cost of deconstructing President Trump\u2019s border wall, to name a few. But none led to sharp exchanges, as the candidates favored quippy one-liners over sustained attacks. With little conflict to help distinguish the candidates on a number of issues, the consensus among my colleagues was that the debate was, well, boring. Nearly all the previous debates revolved around Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren and their health care plans. This time, they were mostly relegated to background players on the stage. While both had brief moments, neither lodged a particularly memorable line. And health care, for the first time in five rounds of debates, didn\u2019t dominate the discussion. When asked about the Me Too movement, former Vice President Joe Biden said that Americans just have to keep \u201cpunching at it, and punching at it, and punching at it\u201d to change the culture of violence against women. \u201cI come out of the black community,\u201d Mr. Biden said, perplexingly, at a later point. And at least one of his flubs prompted incredulous cross talk from others on the stage, when he suggested that only one black woman had been elected to the Senate. Ms. Harris, who was standing two lecterns over, is the second. While those comments will rile up those who oppose him, they seem unlikely to seriously shake his strong support among black voters. The Hawaii congresswoman took more incoming fire than in any previous debate, as rivals painted her as a closet Republican and a conservative media darling who loves nothing more than attacking the Democratic Party she aims to lead. Analysis of her support shows that she draws more from conservatives and Republicans than any other candidate, so it\u2019s unclear whether this will hurt her modest standing in the race.

      "author": "Alexander Burns",
      "content": "  COLUMBUS, Ohio \u2014 For months, the Democratic presidential race has seemed to move inexorably toward a confrontation between former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. As Ms. Warren gathered financial support and strength in the polls, Mr. Biden steadily slid on both fronts while the rest of the Democratic field stagnated with voters. A jumbled primary appeared on the verge of becoming a contest between two front-runners. But the debate in central Ohio on Tuesday night showed that the rest of the Democratic pack was not ready to yield. From the moderate wing of the party, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota are now confronting Ms. Warren directly on her policy views and challenging Mr. Biden implicitly for his status as the party\u2019s dominant centrist. From the left, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has returned to the race with force after a heart attack that shook his candidacy, collecting valuable endorsements from prominent left-wing women in Congress, including Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Klobuchar, in assailing Ms. Warren by name, and Mr. Sanders, in rolling out endorsements from the most coveted figures in progressive politics, are acknowledging the same urgency about halting the drift toward a two-person primary. But that task could be easier because of what may ultimately prove to be this week\u2019s most consequential development: Mr. Biden, who raised $6.3 million on the day he entered the race in April, revealed Tuesday that he has run through so much money that he has less than $9 million left. That is far less than what the two leading liberals in the race, Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren, as well as Mr. Buttigieg, have on hand. Mr. Biden insisted on Wednesday that he was \u201cconfident\u201d in his financial position and was not contemplating any changes to his campaign because of money. But between Mr. Biden\u2019s apparent weakness, the sudden onslaught against Ms. Warren and signs of new relevance from Mr. Sanders, there is now at least enough uncertainty in the race to encourage even long-shot candidates to persist. \u201cPeople have been saying the race was going to solidify into Biden-versus-Warren,\u201d said Paul Begala, a longtime Democratic strategist. \u201cI think instead it has become more fluid than ever.\u201d Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, who is backing Ms. Klobuchar, said in an interview Wednesday he believed there was still plenty of room to make headway in the Democratic race, because many voters were only now \u201creally listening and tuning in.\u201d \u201cIt felt like the moment is here,\u201d Mr. Walz said of the debate. Without criticizing other candidates by name, Mr. Walz predicted Ms. Klobuchar would appeal to \u201ca broader swath of folks\u201d beyond activists on the left, and also to voters\u2019 \u201chunger to get back to a decency and a normalcy\u201d \u2014 political currents Mr. Biden has sought to tap into, with mixed success. Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren, of course, continue to loom over their rivals and it is unlikely that the debate will prompt an immediate change in fortunes for either candidate. On Wednesday, Mr. Biden attempted to reassert himself by taking on Ms. Warren in more caustic terms at an event in Ohio. He called it \u201cabsolutely ridiculous\u201d that Ms. Warren had not been clearer about how she would pay for a \u201cMedicare for all\u201d system and challenged her to be \u201ccandid and honest\u201d about it. At the moment, Ms. Warren appears to have an upper hand in most of the early-voting states, along with a powerful campaign war chest stocked with a reservoir of online donors, while Mr. Biden still holds a slight lead in national polls and the conviction among many older Democrats that he would be the safest nominee to challenge President Trump. Yet both Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren have vulnerabilities that their underdog opponents are now determined to exploit: his poll numbers have dropped steadily since the start of the summer and his campaign is in the midst of a financial crunch. And Ms. Warren must still allay Democratic concerns about her strength as a general-election candidate and strike a delicate balance between locking down liberal voters who also like Mr. Sanders while growing her support among moderates and racial minorities. Aaron Pickrell, an Ohio-based Democratic strategist, said the debate had shown that \u201cother candidates getting into the top tier is not insurmountable.\u201d Both Ms. Klobuchar and Mr. Buttigieg, he said, had begun to break through with a message of Midwestern pragmatism that could appeal to voters in the early states. \u201cThey\u2019re setting themselves up as a potential alternative for Biden,\u201d Mr. Pickrell said. \u201cYou can see these folks breaking through when we get to Iowa.\u201d Surveys there indicate that about half the Democrats planning to participate in the caucuses are moderate or conservative; many of these voters have said they are uncommitted or are supporting Mr. Biden but willing to change their minds. Some candidates have more maneuvering room than others to challenge the two leaders: Whereas Mr. Buttigieg and Mr. Sanders are flush with cash, Ms. Klobuchar is in a far more tenuous financial position and has yet to qualify for the debate in November. At least a few other candidates who took an assertive approach Tuesday are in similar straits, straining to raise money or meet the debate threshold or both. What could prove decisive in Iowa, and beyond, is if centrist voters coalesce behind a single candidate or fracture among the group of hopefuls presenting themselves as pragmatists. If Mr. Biden cannot recover a measure of momentum, but holds on to enough support to block other candidates from building a coalition of more moderate Democrats, it could allow Ms. Warren or Mr. Sanders to roll through the earliest primaries and caucuses with relatively weak opposition. This scenario, of a sort of zombie Biden candidacy, is what most alarms supporters of other center-left Democrats in the race. Mayor Nan Whaley of Dayton, Ohio, a close ally of Mr. Buttigieg, predicted the South Bend mayor would now \u201cdig down deep in Iowa and New Hampshire,\u201d carrying his message from the debate \u2014 a combination of uplifting rhetoric about the future and blunt criticism of certain progressive policies \u2014 into the early states where he\u2019s polling in fourth place. Ms. Whaley said she expected Mr. Buttigieg, 37, to make a determined effort to displace Mr. Biden as the candidate seen as most capable of speaking to Midwesterners. \u201cWhat you have with Pete is, you have somebody who speaks so amazingly well to this part of the country and is incredibly electable,\u201d Ms. Whaley said, adding, \u201cWhat Biden does is, he tells you all he\u2019s done for us, which really hasn\u2019t been enough because we\u2019ve had 30 years of failed policy in the Midwest.\u201d But it is not Mr. Buttigieg who is depending on millennials to claim the nomination \u2014 it\u2019s the oldest candidate in the race, the 78-year-old Mr. Sanders. And that is why his endorsements from Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota \u2014 and an expected one from Rashida Tlaib of Michigan \u2014 could prove so vital to at least sustaining his campaign. Their appeal with younger progressives offers Mr. Sanders a vote of confidence he can trumpet to the voting bloc that makes up his strongest constituency. That cue has particular resonance in this moment, when even some of the senator\u2019s supporters have been wondering about his prospects following his hospitalization and acknowledgment that he may have to slow down the pace of his campaign. \u201cTheir endorsement is huge in validating him as a face for the party and movement going forward,\u201d said Representative Ro Khanna of California, a co-chair of Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign. Mr. Khanna said the backing from three women of color would help Mr. Sanders in another crucial way at a time when Democrats are moving left on racial issues \u2014 by rebutting the criticism that his is a niche campaign for white, left-wing men. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say we\u2019re just Bernie Bros when you have the most visible progressives from communities of color coming out and saying, \u2018We\u2019re for Bernie Sanders,\u2019\u201d Mr. Khanna argued. \u201cThat\u2019s more powerful than what Bernie Sanders or any of his co-chairs can say about his polling or support.\u201d The question now, for Mr. Sanders and the other well-funded contenders, is how they begin spending their money. With the race moving into the fall and the candidates needing ways to get attention amid saturation of coverage with the impeachment inquiry, many Democrats expect the attacks on the debate stage to begin playing out on the airwaves. Even more than the verbal fisticuffs and flashy endorsements, it was Mr. Biden\u2019s comparably weak financial standing that prompted many Democrats to think a new phase may be at hand. \u201cThat went off like a bomb this morning,\u201d said Mr. Begala, noting that his phone was \u201cblowing up with texts\u201d about the putative front-runner\u2019s money struggles. Mr. Biden\u2019s problem could be even more dire than it appears, Mr. Begala said. That\u2019s because he is so reliant on raising money from wealthy donors, who are often fickle and want to pick a winner, while those who outraised him can keep bringing in contributions online without devoting so much time and money to finance events.",

      "author": "Carl Hulse",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Senate Republicans are conflicted about how quickly to move on an impeachment trial against President Trump, with some arguing for a speedy vote on the charges and others seeing an opportunity to drag out the historic proceedings and tie down some Democratic senators at a prime moment in their presidential campaigns. Republican senators say the split over how to approach what is likely to be the first presidential impeachment trial ever to unfold in an election year has been on vivid display in their private weekly lunches in the Capitol. Some senators argued last week that the articles of impeachment likely to emerge from the House later this year do not merit the slightest consideration, and should be quickly dispensed with, so as to limit the damage they could do to Mr. Trump and his party. Others mused with relish this week about the prospect of keeping the six Democratic presidential candidates who are sitting senators chained to their desks in the Capitol for weeks on end as crucial primary contests unfold. \u201cThere are lots of different opinions within the conference as to how long the impeachment in the Senate will take or should take, and those are different questions,\u201d said Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, the No. 3 Senate Republican. \u201cClearly there\u2019s not 51 votes for any one thing, so this is going to have to begin and then play out over time.\u201d Keeping anxious candidates stuck in Washington during campaign season, rather than out connecting with voters, is a tried-and-true political tactic in Congress. But the strict Senate rules for impeachment would take it to an extreme. Under Senate requirements for an impeachment trial, senators must sit attentively at their desks every afternoon except Sunday. That means they would not be able to flit in and out of Washington for occasional votes while spending most of their time campaigning in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, or on the phone raising money. Senators could choose to skip the proceedings, but then would likely have to contend with accusations they were shirking their constitutional responsibility. Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican and majority leader, was the first to raise the potential dilemma for the six presidential contestants \u2014 Senators Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kamala Harris of California, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Michael Bennet of Colorado, Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. \u201cThe question is how long does the Senate want to take,\u201d he told reporters last week. \u201cHow long do presidential candidates want to be here on the floor of the Senate, instead of in Iowa and New Hampshire and all of these other related issues that may be going on at the same time?\u201d Mr. McConnell may have been trying to drive home for Democrats the downsides of dragging out the trial, but he helped instigate a new school of thought \u2014 that Republicans could disrupt the Democratic primary by themselves prolonging the process. Senator Richard M. Burr, Republican of North Carolina, added fuel to the idea when he speculated aloud that a Senate trial could take six to eight weeks \u2014 longer than the five-week trial for President Bill Clinton in 1999. Mr. Burr told colleagues that he pulled the number out of the air based on his own experience as a member of the House during Mr. Clinton\u2019s impeachment, but his comments spurred senators to begin discussing among themselves the disadvantages for the Democrats. A prolonged trial could have implications for the president as well, allowing new information to emerge and potentially giving public credibility to the accusations against him. At the same time, close Republican allies of the president argue a speedy dismissal would convey to the public that the Democratic claims against him are groundless and unworthy of even the barest consideration. \u201cI think it\u2019s purely a partisan adventure right now by the Democrats, so I think the shorter the better,\u201d said Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky. \u201cI think we\u2019re having a debate over policy, not really over impeachable offenses. The sooner we can be done with it, the better.\u201d That approach has its own problems. It worries embattled Republican senators up for re-election who don\u2019t want to be seen by independent voters as unwilling to seriously consider that the president may have acted inappropriately. Mr. McConnell has also been cold to the idea of an immediate dismissal of the charges against Mr. Trump, telling colleagues that he believes the Senate must show that it is approaching an impeachment trial with solemnity and seriousness. Any hint that Republicans were focused mainly on sabotaging Democratic presidential candidates would undercut that effort. Mr. McConnell is also loath to force Republican members into any high-profile votes that show division among them, and a quick motion to dismiss probably would. \u201cI think it\u2019s impossible to predict how long we\u2019ll be on it or predict which motions would pass,\u201d Mr. McConnell said Wednesday as the first public impeachment hearing unfolded in the House. \u201cNo way to know.\u201d Republicans said the new focus on timing \u2014 and the implications for the Democratic presidential contenders \u2014 could have a positive benefit for both sides, serving to force senators to concentrate on just how they want the trial to develop as they move slowly toward bipartisan negotiations on ground rules for the trial. As for the presidential hopefuls in the Senate, most seem resigned to the idea that they will be forced to spend more time at their day jobs during a pivotal period in the race for their party\u2019s nomination. The first caucus, in Iowa, will be on Feb. 3. The trial could conceivably provide an advantage to top-tier candidates not in the Senate such as Pete Buttigieg and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., himself a former longtime senator, allowing them more time alone with early-state voters while their rivals sit quietly through an impeachment trial in Washington. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to see it this way, but if he\u2019s here in Iowa and six of his main competitors have to be in Washington, I think it\u2019s going to help him,\u201d said State Representative Bruce Hunter, an Iowa Democrat supporting Mr. Biden. But he was quick to note that many of Mr. Biden\u2019s opponents have strong field organizations, and that Iowa Democrats expect the senators to meet their obligations on Capitol Hill in a moment of national crisis. While being in Washington for an impeachment trial could afford endless cable news time for the six senators running for president, it would hinder their ability to push stories to early-state local news outlets, the sort of coverage campaigns prize in the run-up to the first nominating contests, officials with several 2020 campaigns said this week. Yet the senators and officials with their campaigns have said in recent days that they have an obligation to attend an impeachment trial of the president. \u201cWill your schedule change if there\u2019s an impeachment trial? Yes, yes,\u201d Ms. Klobuchar said earlier this month at a stop in Iowa. \u201cBut you see, I have the most endorsements of anyone from elected officials in the presidential race, so I have a lot of nice surrogates.\u201d Mr. Sanders, during an interview with ABC News that aired Sunday, said he would be forced to adjust his schedule to attend an impeachment trial. \u201cI guess I\u2019m just going to have to try to be in Washington, D.C., in Des Moines, Iowa, and Concord, N.H., at the same time,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cI will do my best.\u201d",

      "content": "  Pete Buttigieg was trying a little tenderness. \u201cI\u2019m running to be the president for that day the sun comes up and the Trump presidency is behind us,\u201d said the millennial mayor of South Bend, Ind., pumping his left fist a bit for the crescendo, \u201cwhich will be a tender moment in the life of this country.\u201d Senator Kamala Harris had another impulse. By Wednesday evening, the nation\u2019s foremost political drama had been confined to the capital, where marathon impeachment proceedings into President Trump have siphoned oxygen from the Democratic primary less than three months before the voting begins. Onstage in Atlanta, Mr. Trump\u2019s leading challengers had been asked a thorny political question: How do you run a campaign in impeachment\u2019s long shadow? \u201cWe have a criminal living in the White House,\u201d Ms. Harris said, nodding grimly before appearing to tweak Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s rosy view. \u201cAnd there is no question that in 2020, the biggest issue before us, until we get to that tender moment, is justice is on the ballot.\u201d The candidates\u2019 divergent messages laid bare a central tension in this Democratic primary: finding a way to stand out when the sitting president, tweeting and rampaging through impeachment, tends to edge into the frame whether or not he is in the room. With Democratic voters desperate to defeat a man they view as a singular threat, much of the primary has turned on the difficult-to-define question of electability \u2014 on who can take the fight most powerfully to Mr. Trump, how much emphasis that should earn in what is ostensibly an intraparty battle of ideas and who can piece together the most formidable coalition next fall. On Wednesday, several of the candidates embraced the kind of meta-punditry that voters have often demanded, sketching out their paths to victory in detail. Senator Amy Klobuchar and Mr. Buttigieg highlighted their Midwestern credentials, with Ms. Klobuchar noting her strength in \u201cred and purple\u201d congressional districts in her home state of Minnesota. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who has premised much of his candidacy on the idea that he stands the best chance against Mr. Trump, suggested that he was uniquely positioned not only to defeat Mr. Trump but also to help Democrats expand their ranks on Capitol Hill. But the most pointed argument came from Ms. Harris, perhaps alluding again to Mr. Buttigieg, who has glided to the top of early-state polls but still struggles mightily with voters of color, the bedrock of the party. \u201cWe need someone on that stage who has the ability to go toe to toe with Donald Trump,\u201d Ms. Harris said, \u201cand someone who has the ability to rebuild the Obama coalition.\u201d Mr. Buttigieg, playing to his biographical strengths, suggested the more useful electoral background was his own. \u201cWe need somebody who can go toe to toe who actually comes from the kinds of communities that he\u2019s been appealing to,\u201d Mr. Buttigieg said, nodding to Mr. Trump\u2019s popularity in parts of the industrial Midwest. \u201cI don\u2019t talk a big game about helping the working class while helicoptering between golf courses with my name on them. I don\u2019t even golf.\u201d Left unsaid on Wednesday, at a debate held in a large majority-black city, was that in a party that has long prided itself on its diversity, the top four candidates at present \u2014 Mr. Biden, Mr. Buttigieg, Senator Elizabeth Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders \u2014 are all white. Ms. Harris and Cory Booker, two black senators once seen as major contenders, have flagged in the polls. Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former federal housing secretary and the only Latino in the race, did not qualify for this debate. \u201cFor too long, I think, candidates have taken for granted constituencies that have been the backbone of the Democratic Party,\u201d Ms. Harris said a short while later, punctuating a forceful night. \u201cWhen it\u2019s close to election time, they show up at a black church.\u201d She spoke twice more about \u201cthe Obama coalition.\u201d \u201cI keep referring to that because that\u2019s the last time we won,\u201d she said. Mr. Buttigieg said he welcomed \u201cthe challenge of connecting with black voters in America who don\u2019t yet know me,\u201d noting that he runs a city \u201cthat is racially diverse and largely low-income\u201d and reflecting on his own experience with discrimination as a gay man. Mr. Biden, who in polls currently has a commanding lead with African-American voters, sought to emphasize his own credibility with that demographic \u2014 but he overlooked Ms. Harris, a black senator, in the process. \u201cI\u2019m part of that Obama coalition,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cI come out of the black community in terms of my support. If you notice, I have more people supporting me in the black community that have announced for me because they know me, they know who I am. Three former chairs of the black caucus, the only African-American woman that had ever been elected to the United States Senate \u2014\u201d Mr. Booker and Ms. Harris objected as the California senator, laughing, raised her arms in amusement. Mr. Biden clarified that he meant to say \u2014 or perhaps thought he said \u2014 the first African-American woman elected to the Senate, not the only one. As with past debates, a truism of presidential politics seemed to hold: Combat is the sincerest form of flattery. When Mr. Biden was dominating the polls early in the primary, debate nights devolved frequently into a stage-wide game of whack-a-veep. Last month, after Ms. Warren seemed to be overtaking him, she took her turn absorbing attacks. By evening\u2019s end on Wednesday, Mr. Buttigieg, who is leading in Iowa in the latest poll from The Des Moines Register and CNN, had reason to feel reasonably flattered. Ms. Klobuchar expressed her \u201cappreciation,\u201d a bit dismissively, for his work \u201cas a local official.\u201d Representative Tulsi Gabbard, who has delighted this year in criticizing other Democrats, called one of Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s recent comments about foreign policy \u201ccareless.\u201d Mr. Booker, joking of his \u201clifetime of experience with black voters\u201d as a black voter himself, seemed to have Mr. Buttigieg in mind when he said, \u201cNo one on this stage should need a focus group to hear from African-American voters.\u201d The former vice president was less eager to confront Mr. Buttigieg directly, even as the mayor seeks to emerge as a younger moderate alternative for voters alarmed at Mr. Biden\u2019s uneven performances. Mr. Biden stumbled on Wednesday as he sought to discuss one of his signature issues: health care. He intends to give Americans the option to maintain their private health insurance \u2014 but he initially contradicted himself. \u201cWe should build on Obamacare, provide the plan I put forward before anybody in here, adding a Medicare option in that plan and not make people choose \u2014 allow people to choose, I should say,\u201d he said. Mr. Biden, a former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was smoother when discussing foreign policy. And one of his strongest moments in the debate came when he said he would defer to his Justice Department on whether Mr. Trump should face a potential criminal investigation after he leaves office. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea that we model ourselves after Trump and say, \u2018lock him up,\u2019\u201d Mr. Biden said. Other flourishes were less elegant. At one point, he seemed to suggest that violence against women could be addressed by \u201cpunching\u201d it. \u201cNo man has a right to raise a hand to a woman in anger other than in self-defense, and that rarely ever occurs,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cSo we have to just change the culture, period, and keep punching at it and punching at it.\u201d It was probably always going to be an unusual evening. Even unmemorable debates generally monopolize the nation\u2019s political attention for at least a couple of hours. But on Wednesday, the day\u2019s chief political moment had plainly already happened, in Washington, by the time the candidates took the stage. More bizarre still, the debate did not feature the two would-be contenders whose renewed interest in the 2020 race has shadowed the primary recently: former Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts, who entered the contest last week, and former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York, who could follow him soon. Yet for all the candidates onstage \u2014 whether fighting for relevance, qualification for future debates or a polling lead \u2014 the forum supplied a crucial opportunity for airtime, and to test out new jokes or dust off old material. Ms. Klobuchar had a chance to deploy a well-practiced bit: \u201cMy first Senate race I literally called everyone I knew and I raised $17,000 from ex-boyfriends,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019d like to point out it is not an expanding base.\u201d Mr. Sanders jumped on the subject of Medicare for all with his catchphrase: \u201cI wrote the damn bill.\u201d When asked, Mr. Yang said that as president, his first comment to Russian leader Vladimir V. Putin would be, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I beat your guy.\u201d Mr. Booker laced into Mr. Biden\u2019s recently expressed reservations about legalizing  marijuana. \u201cI thought you might have been high when you said it,\u201d Mr. Booker said. Mr. Biden wobbled a bit behind his lectern, smirking. Yet in his closing remarks, Mr. Booker reminded viewers of a curious truth: He has not yet qualified for next month\u2019s debate.",

      "author": "Neil Vigdor",
      "content": " At their best, they were clever and unscripted. A timely comeback. A witty one-liner. At their worst, they were robotic and rambling. Clumsy. Cringe-worthy. Here are some of the most memorable moments from Wednesday\u2019s Democratic presidential debate in Atlanta, hosted by MSNBC and The Washington Post. Senator Kamala Harris of California said President Trump had compromised the checks and balances on North Korea\u2019s nuclear capabilities with his unilateral dealings with the country\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un. She said Mr. Trump was the greatest threat to the national security of the United States, pointing to his decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement and the Iran nuclear deal, as well as his decision to pull American troops from Northern Syria. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts opened the debate by saying Gordon D. Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union, had no qualifications other than his $1 million contribution to President Trump\u2019s inaugural committee. Ms. Warren said Mr. Sondland\u2019s testimony during an impeachment proceeding in the House of Representatives on Wednesday added to the mounting evidence that President Trump had tied foreign aid to Ukraine to an investigation of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s son. Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., said that Mr. Trump was not putting critical military resources into things like artificial intelligence for border security. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota avoided a direct attack on Mr. Buttigieg when asked about her comment that a woman with his credentials would not be doing as well as a candidate. But Ms. Klobuchar did not shrink from the moment of getting a point across that women candidates are treated differently. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey created a buzz with his dig at Mr. Biden, who recently said he opposed the legalization of marijuana. Mr. Booker said Mr. Biden\u2019s position on cannabis was at odds with the progressive wing of the Democratic Party and many black Americans, who he said have been disproportionately hurt by criminal charges related to marijuana. Andrew Yang, the former tech executive and entrepreneur, was asked what he would say to Vladimir Putin in their first conservation if elected president. Mr. Yang answered that he would tell the Russian president that his \u201cdays of meddling in American elections are over.\u201d Mr. Biden quipped about a recent swipe at him by Mr. Kim, as quoted by North Korean state media. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont then interjected, \u201cOther than that, you like him,\u201d which drew laughs from the candidates and audience. Mr. Biden used the wrong metaphor as a point of emphasis when asking what he would do to address the culture of violence toward women in the United States. He started his answer by urging Congress to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, which Mr. Biden championed when he was a member of the United States Senate. Mr. Biden, who has enjoyed strong polling numbers among black voters, rattled off a list of endorsements of prominent African-American lawmakers and said there was reason that his appeal transcended racial lines. But Mr. Biden flubbed the number of black women who have served in the Senate: there have been two. He was endorsed by former Senator Carol Moseley Braun of Illinois, the first black woman elected to the chamber. The second, Ms. Harris, was onstage to his left.",

      "author": "Alexander Burns",
      "content": "  The Democratic presidential candidates yielded to the furor surrounding the impeachment inquiry in Washington in their primary debate on Wednesday, for the first time training their fire more steadily on President Trump than on one another and presenting a largely united front on vital issues like climate change and abortion rights. One month after the party\u2019s moderate wing led a ferocious attack against Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts at the previous debate, the leading Democrats opted to mute their rivalries and restrain their language, mainly detailing their disagreements in gentle or at most passive-aggressive terms. There were moments of direct friction, especially in the final minutes of the debate over matters of national security, but in many cases the candidates\u2019 criticism was couched within jocular one-liners or pragmatic arguments about electability. Most telling were a handful of sharper exchanges among the 10 candidates onstage in Atlanta related to matters of race and gender. Several expressed concerns about the prospect of nominating a white man, like former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. or Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. Senators Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of California both warned that the party could not afford to select a candidate who was not capable of exciting African-American voters, and Ms. Harris repeatedly invoked \u201cthe Obama coalition\u201d as the Democrats\u2019 best hope for electoral success. \u201cBlack voters are pissed off and they\u2019re worried,\u201d Mr. Booker said, lamenting that too many African-American voters hear from Democratic candidates only during election season. He also rebuked Mr. Biden for expressing resistance last weekend to legalizing marijuana, joking, \u201cI thought you might have been high when you said it.\u201d Mr. Buttigieg and Mr. Biden both insisted they were capable of marshaling support from minority voters. Mr. Buttigieg acknowledged that he faced \u201cthe challenge of connecting with black voters\u201d who do not know him yet, and Mr. Biden argued that his present strength with African-American primary voters spoke for itself. \u201cI was part of that coalition,\u201d he said, even adding: \u201cI come out of the black community.\u201d As for the Obama coalition, Mr. Biden once again referred to his personal bond with the former president: \u201cI was part of that coalition,\u201d he said. It was widely anticipated that Mr. Buttigieg would become a kind of political pin cushion onstage, as other Democrats sought to harry him as the emerging front-runner in Iowa. But it was only in the final moments of the debate that he drew sustained criticism, first from Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and then, more caustically, from Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii. But it was unclear whether anyone raised new doubts about the young mayor as a contender for the nation\u2019s most powerful office. Ms. Klobuchar noted that Mr. Buttigieg, 37, had lost his only statewide election, and lacked a governing record on issues, like voting rights, that he talked about on the campaign trail.  \u201cI think experience should matter,\u201d she said. But Mr. Buttigieg, using a recurring tactic of deflection, dismissed the value of experience in Washington and cited his service in the military. Ms. Gabbard was a more persistent adversary, rebuking Mr. Buttigieg for saying in a recent interview that he might be willing to deploy American troops in Mexico to fight violence there. Mr. Buttigieg again held his ground, calling Ms. Gabbard\u2019s characterization of his remarks \u201coutlandish\u201d and chiding her for having met with the \u201cmurderous dictator\u201d Bashar al-Assad during a trip to Syria. But for the most part, the Democrats focused on denouncing Mr. Trump. That was in part because, unlike at previous debates, the moderators avoided stoking rivalries and highlighting differences. Yet the lack of vitriol and the intense focus on electability also owed to the nature of this campaign, which as the impeachment inquiry unfolds is becoming even more centered on finding the best candidate to defeat the president. The candidates attacked Mr. Trump both for his actions toward Ukraine that have prompted impeachment proceedings and for a longer litany of offenses, including his detention of children at the Mexican border, his warm relationships with dictatorial governments in Saudi Arabia and North Korea and his appointment of political cronies to prominent jobs. The debate also highlighted the considerable areas of agreement across the Democratic field on overarching policy goals, including taking aggressive action to counter climate change, expanding voting rights and restoring traditional American alliances around the world. Ms. Warren used the impeachment inquiry, and the testimony on Wednesday by Gordon D. Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union and a Trump donor, to criticize the practice of installing wealthy political supporters in overseas embassies. Mr. Booker railed against Mr. Trump for what he described as his human rights violations at the southern border, such as \u201cwhen children are thrown in cages.\u201d Ms. Harris jabbed that Mr. Trump \u201cgot punked\u201d by Kim Jong-un, the North Korean dictator, in nuclear negotiations. For Ms. Klobuchar, it was Mr. Trump\u2019s forgiving treatment of Saudi Arabia after its agents kidnapped and killed the journalist Jamal Khashoggi. \u201cThat sent a signal to dictators around the world that that\u2019s O.K.,\u201d Ms. Klobuchar said. Still, if there were no heated moments likely to endure past the evening, as there had been in past debates, there were fault lines within the field, separating the most progressive candidates, like Ms. Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, from comparatively moderate figures like Mr. Biden, Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Klobuchar. Mr. Buttigieg, who eagerly assailed Ms. Warren\u2019s health care policies at the debate in October, was far more veiled in his criticism this time, arguing that Democrats must \u201cgalvanize not polarize\u201d a coalition representing a majority of voters. And Ms. Klobuchar suggested that there were candidates who were making big promises \u201cbecause they sound good on a bumper sticker and then throw in a free car.\u201d But neither of them named names or tried a direct attack as they had done last month. Similarly, Ms. Harris, whose campaign has been on a downward spiral in the polls, notably declined an opportunity to confront Mr. Buttigieg. The leading candidates of the left took much the same approach. Mr. Sanders, defending his support for single-payer health care, referred to skeptical competitors who he said believed \u201cthat we should not take on the insurance company, we should not take on the pharmaceutical industry.\u201d But he did not say to whom he was referring. Mr. Sanders took only an oblique shot at Ms. Warren, who has not prioritized his \u201cMedicare for all\u201d legislation, noting that he would introduce his single-payer system \u201cin the first week\u201d of his presidency. Mr. Biden did not appear to incur new damage to his campaign, which has been durable despite some of his self-inflicted errors. Yet at a moment when a pair of new candidates were entering the race in part because of his perceived weakness, the former vice president appeared tongue-tied on more than one occasion. He drew nervous laughter when, in discussing domestic violence, he said it was important to keep \u201cpunching at\u201d the problem. And when he was boasting about receiving the support of the first African-American woman elected to the Senate, former Senator Carol Moseley Braun, he referred to her as the only black woman elected to the body rather than the first. That prompted a bemused response from Ms. Harris. \u201cThe other one is here,\u201d she said. Mr. Biden, who has staked his campaign on the perception that he is a strong general election candidate, focused on his broad appeal, urging Democrats to pick a nominee who could \u201cgo into states like Georgia and North Carolina and other places and get a Senate majority.\u201d It was, atypically, Mr. Booker, normally a nonconfrontational voice on the debate stage, who opened a more contentious phase in the first half of the debate, critiquing Ms. Warren\u2019s proposal for a tax on the nation\u2019s largest fortunes. \u201cIt\u2019s cumbersome,\u201d Mr. Booker jabbed. \u201cIt\u2019s been tried by other nations. It\u2019s hard to evaluate.\u201d The exchanges grew notably less polite, though, when Ms. Harris was offered a chance to respond on a foreign policy question that went to Ms. Gabbard, who had targeted Ms. Harris at a debate over the summer. Ms. Harris, with payback in mind, ignored the policy element of the question and unloaded on Ms. Gabbard. She noted that her rival had been a frequent guest on Fox News, refused to call Mr. al-Assad \u201ca war criminal\u201d and \u201cbuddied up to Steve Bannon\u201d during Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential transition. Ms. Gabbard responded that Ms. Harris was merely offering \u201clies and smears and innuendo\u201d and asserted that the senator would continue the \u201cBush-Clinton-Trump foreign policy of regime change wars.\u201d Mr. Buttigieg, who is rising rapidly in the polls in Iowa, found himself for the first time in the position of defending his qualifications for the presidency. Mr. Buttigieg, who has never held statewide office, argued that from the vantage point of South Bend it was \u201cthe usual way of doing business in Washington is what looks small.\u201d Two of Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s rivals pushed back more or less gently. Mr. Booker, a former mayor of Newark, described himself as \u201cthe other Rhodes scholar mayor on this stage\u201d \u2014 perhaps his most pointed expression of feeling overlooked in the race. But it was Ms. Klobuchar who most effectively pivoted from her past criticism of Mr. Buttigieg, whom she has described as benefiting in the race from being male, into a forceful plea to the country to elect a female president. \u201cWomen are held to a higher standard, otherwise we could play a game called name your favorite woman president,\u201d Ms. Klobuchar said, brandishing one of her favorite lines from the campaign trail: \u201cIf you think a woman can\u2019t beat Donald Trump, Nancy Pelosi does it every single day.\u201d While she was not as pugilistic as in the last forum, Ms. Klobuchar enjoyed another series of memorable moments in this debate, including a crack about raising money from ex-boyfriends. The businessman Andrew Yang, who has attracted a strong niche following of mostly younger voters, received little time but drew a mix of applause and laughs when he was called on. Asked what he would say, as president, in his first phone call with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, Mr. Yang responded, \u201cWell, first I\u2019d say I\u2019m sorry I beat your guy.\u201d Since the debate last month, the race has become more fluid than ever; former Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts has entered the primary contest, and former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York has taken steps to do the same. They have been lured into the campaign in part over their concerns about the leftward drift in the party, and also because there is still no clear front-runner with just over two months until the Iowa caucuses. It remains far from certain that they will be able to catch on so late in the race, but both have made clear that they are trying to win over more moderate voters.",

But the expansive $20.5 trillion package could come to define her candidacy anyway.By Shane Goldmacher, Sarah Kliff and Thomas KaplanPRINT EDITIONHow Warren Found a Focus In Health Care|November 18, 2019, Page A1",
      "author": "Shane Goldmacher",
      "content": "   Two days before Senator Elizabeth Warren rolled out a fundamental reimagining of America\u2019s health care and tax system \u2014 a $20.5 trillion package that would dwarf all her previous plans combined \u2014 she was working the phones to personally preview her proposal and sell it to a select group of political influencers. One was Paul Krugman, the Nobel Prize-winning economist and New York Times columnist, who had written skeptically days earlier that her plan to pay for \u201cMedicare for all\u201d was a \u201cmake-or-break moment\u201d for her, if not the whole 2020 race. Another call was to Representative Pramila Jayapal, the lead sponsor of Medicare for all legislation in the House and a leading liberal as the co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. \u201cPramila,\u201d Ms. Warren told her, \u201cwe\u2019re gonna do this.\u201d She would soon need every ally possible: Ms. Warren\u2019s announcement of her Medicare for all financing package is perhaps the riskiest political bet of her campaign. Her Democratic rivals have attacked her plan as unfeasible and some voters worry that it is too radical. Ms. Warren would guarantee government health coverage to every American for the first time, erase the existing system of private insurance that currently covers more than 170 million people and pay for it with huge new taxes on corporations and the wealthy but not, her campaign claimed, with \u201cone penny\u201d from the middle class. The sprawling plan is the culmination of Ms. Warren\u2019s yearslong journey toward a full embrace of Medicare for all and a clear sign that she believes her path to the Democratic nomination, and her party\u2019s to the White House, is through full-throated liberalism. And yet the politics of health care have always been thorny \u2014 they powered the Democratic takeover of the House in 2018 and the Republican wave in 2010. Ms. Warren appeared to nod to that reality on Friday, announcing a two-step transition plan that would give her up to three years to try to pass  Medicare for all. The twist is that health care was never supposed to define Ms. Warren\u2019s candidacy. That was Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019s signature issue. Ms. Warren had entered the race and gained momentum with a populist agenda focused on breaking up Big Tech, tackling corruption in Washington and on Wall Street, and making corporations and the wealthiest Americans pay more in taxes. But her decision to remake the health care system is now a major part of the 2020 debate, and Ms. Warren\u2019s upward momentum in the polls has stalled as her opponents have assailed her. Political strategists say the sheer scope of her plan and her support for ending private insurance threaten to subsume her candidacy. \u201cShe took most, if not all, of her chips and put them on this \u2014 and I do think it took a lot of political guts,\u201d said Chris Lehane, a veteran Democratic strategist who worked in the Clinton White House. \u201cBy going big on health care, she will either go to the White House on this issue or go home because of it.\u201d How Ms. Warren came to put together her blueprint, including her determination to avoid middle-class tax increases, offers a revealing window into the methodical way that she operates, her approach to political balancing acts and how she might govern as president. It is a story that begins with Ms. Warren researching medical bankruptcies at Harvard nearly two decades ago and ends with her as a front-runner for the Democratic nomination, rolling out a plan while under siege from her rivals for more specifics. Throughout, Ms. Warren has kept one eye trained on policy and the other on realpolitik: protecting her aspirational brand of liberalism and robbing Republicans (and her Democratic rivals) of a potent talking point about middle-class taxes. She ignored those in the Democratic establishment who had warned her against eliminating private insurance, and ultimately settled on a proposal whose math loosely adds up but that many, even within her party, see as mostly a values statement. The transition she announced Friday focuses her first 100 days on a public health insurance plan closer to what her more moderate rivals have championed \u2014 drawing instant condemnation that she was trying to have it both ways. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to beat Donald Trump next year with double talk on health care,\u201d Kate Bedingfield, a deputy campaign manager for Mr. Biden, said on Friday. The backlash seemed to ensure that Ms. Warren will face even more pressure to explain her stance in the Democratic debate in Atlanta on Wednesday. \u201cUp until putting a price tag on Medicare for all she had imposed her will on the primary and dictated the tempo on her terms,\u201d Mr. Lehane said. \u201cThis is first time that she is having to react and not follow her campaign script.\u201d Ms. Warren had a plan for everything. That was her calling card almost from the start of the race. But health care was conspicuous it its absence, all the way back to her first trip to Iowa, when she barely mentioned Medicare for all. In June, Ms. Warren simply tucked into the slipstream of her liberal rival, Mr. Sanders, on his signature issue. \u201cI\u2019m with Bernie on Medicare for all,\u201d she said at the first debate. But by fall, health care was emerging as the No. 1 issue in the campaign, and the absence of a plan was increasingly untenable. She was dogged for weeks by questions about whom she would raise taxes on, saying only that total costs for the middle class would go down. \u201cYour signature, senator, is to have a plan for everything,\u201d Mayor Pete Buttigieg took aim at the last debate. \u201cExcept this.\u201d What few people knew then was that Ms. Warren and her Boston-based team had been privately crunching numbers since at least late August, working with the internal imperative to craft a package without hiking middle-class taxes, according to interviews with people directly involved in the process. The onslaught at the debate accelerated the timeline. One academic described working so hard with Warren officials in late October that he was distracted from his teaching duties; another said she made final edits on a letter endorsing Ms. Warren\u2019s math in her car at her child\u2019s school during a Halloween parade. \u201cSyria is easier compared to this,\u201d said one Warren adviser, granted anonymity to speak about the process of crafting a plan. Kristen Orthman, Ms. Warren\u2019s communications director, said the campaign had not been and would not be buffeted by \u201cthe cable news flavor of the week.\u201d \u201cWe are running a campaign on identifying what\u2019s broken, presenting big ideas to fix it, and building a grass-roots movement to make it happen and that\u2019s exactly what we did here,\u201d Ms. Orthman said. Now Ms. Warren, who declined to be interviewed for this article, must sell her plan to a Democratic Party deeply concerned about ceding any political advantage to President Trump next fall. Skeptics of Medicare for all have ranged from Hillary Clinton to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to former President Barack Obama, who on Friday night issued a warning of his own about disrupting people\u2019s existing insurance. \u201cEighty-five percent of the country has health care,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cThey may not love it, but it roughly works for them.\u201d Kathleen Sebelius, who had a front-row seat to the health care wars of the last decade as Mr. Obama\u2019s first secretary of health and human services, sounded a similar note of caution. \u201cWe saw the Republicans very effectively demagogue the issue,\u201d she said. Even some of Ms. Warren\u2019s supporters are wary. \u201cIt still kind of scares me,\u201d said Eric Spera, a 40-year-old who attended a recent town hall in Goose Creek, S.C. \u201cI love her. I think she\u2019s the best candidate that there is. But that\u2019s the only drawback I have with her.\u201d Yet in some ways, Ms. Warren has almost proceeded as if her announcement did not happen. On the stump, she only glancingly mentions health care. And speaking to reporters the day after unveiling her Medicare for all financing plan, she uncharacteristically stumbled over the specifics, insisting, incorrectly, that only billionaires would see their taxes go up. Nearly two decades earlier, Ms. Warren was meeting with fellow Harvard researchers in her light-filled office at the university\u2019s Radcliffe Institute to pore over hundreds of accounts of how Americans went bankrupt. The same answer kept popping up: medical bills. \u201cWe started to hear things like, \u2018I have diabetes and I can\u2019t afford to save,\u2019 and older people who had no savings left because of their medical bills,\u201d said Deborah Thorne, a researcher who worked closely with Ms. Warren on the project. \u201cI do think you could have watched our views evolving then, both for Elizabeth and me.\u201d Ms. Thorne recalled one story that stood out especially: a middle-aged man who had spent hours debating with his wife about whether to go to the emergency room for a second heart attack; they were worried about the bills they could not afford to pay after the first one. \u201cBoth of us were so moved by the data and the people\u2019s experiences, it made it clear to us: This isn\u2019t working,\u201d Ms. Thorne said. \u201cSo what would?\u201d In 2008, Ms. Thorne and Ms. Warren co-wrote a book chapter where they described single-payer health care as \u201cthe most obvious solution\u201d to medical bankruptcy. A few paragraphs later though, they acknowledged that other policy options exist \u201cif single-payer health insurance is politically unacceptable.\u201d In Ms. Warren\u2019s 2012 Senate run, her lone competitive race against a Republican, she resisted endorsing a government-run health care program, saying \u201cyou\u2019ve got to stay with what\u2019s possible,\u201d an echo of what former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. now says. Four years later another member of the Harvard research team, Steffie Woolhandler, a longtime single-payer advocate, traveled to Washington to make her case for Medicare for all to Ms. Warren. But the senator demurred, saying that she would prioritize \u201csupporting the Affordable Care Act and helping Democrats hold onto the Senate\u201d in the upcoming election. But a year later, it was Ms. Warren reaching out, inviting Ms. Woolhandler to her Massachusetts home on June 19, 2017. There, over tea on an indoor porch, Ms. Warren peppered her with questions about the economics of Medicare for all. \u201cShe seemed to be thinking through the economics \u2014 essentially, why can other nations with single-payer spend no more than we do and cover everybody?\u201d Ms. Woolhandler said. Days later, she called for single-payer for the first time. And in September, she signed onto Mr. Sanders\u2019s single-payer legislation. Mr. Sanders has framed health care chiefly as a matter of human rights, a way to provide medical care to the masses. Ms. Warren focused on eliminating the medical bankruptcies she had seen in her research. Under Medicare for all, she said at the time, \u201cFamilies don\u2019t have to bear the costs of heartbreaking medical disasters on their own.\u201d But she stopped well short that day of saying it was the only way to proceed. \u201cEverything should be on the table,\u201d she said. \u201cMedicare for all is one way.\u201d The Sanders legislation represented an early 2020 ideological crossroads, not only for Ms. Warren but for much of the presidential primary field. Multiple advisers to potential candidates said the decision on whether to join with Mr. Sanders, who had made Medicare for all central to his insurgent 2016 campaign, presented one of the first sorting moments of the coming primary. \u201cThere are people who thought it was a litmus test for being able to run for president,\u201d said Senator Michael Bennet, a moderate Democrat who is using a long-shot presidential bid to warn his party about the electoral risk of Medicare for all. But long after endorsing the Sanders bill, Ms. Warren\u2019s language on Medicare for all remained fluid. In March 2019, at a CNN forum, she said there were \u201ca lot of different pathways\u201d for universal coverage, and that private insurers \u201ccould\u201d still have a role. By June, Ms. Warren was more unequivocal, raising her hand at the first presidential debate to endorse doing away with private insurers entirely. Still, she allowed herself room to maneuver, especially on how the program would be paid for. She repeatedly refused to rule out raising middle-class taxes, saying only that she would lower overall costs. The tension came to a head in a July post-debate interview, when Chris Matthews, pressed her in a live interview on MSNBC to say what would happen to taxes. Over and over, she refused to answer. By September, the headlines were everywhere: The candidate with a plan for everything did not have one for the issue at the center of the race. The tax question became so commonplace that Ms. Warren even got advice from the late-night host Stephen Colbert, who recommended she compare it to taxes for public schools. Behind the scenes, her team was already pressing to get the senator on firmer rhetorical and financial footing. Two long-serving Warren aides, Jon Donenberg and Bharat Ramamurti, were spearheading the effort to develop a financing plan over the summer, with Mr. Donenberg briefing Ms. Warren on various cost options. But the plan was not quite cooked yet by the time she stepped on the debate stage in Ohio with a bull\u2019s-eye on her back. She had just caught Mr. Biden in national polling averages for the first time, and staked out a lead in Iowa. The attacks began almost immediately. First came Mr. Buttigieg. Then Senator Amy Klobuchar (\u201cAt least Bernie\u2019s being honest here,\u201d she said). Then Mr. Biden (\u201cOn the single most important thing facing the American public,\u201d he said, \u201cI think it\u2019s awfully important to be straightforward with them.\u201d) From a hotel room thousands of miles away, Donald Berwick, a former federal health care official, had watched it unfold with growing frustration. For six weeks, he had been stealthily working with Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign to develop a comprehensive way to pay for Medicare for all. \u201cSenator Warren was under tremendous pressure,\u201d Dr. Berwick said. \u201cIt was the same question again and again: Where is your plan? Where is your plan? That\u2019s her thing, she has plans.\u201d But he said that he and Simon Johnson, an M.I.T. economist close to Ms. Warren, were not rushed by campaign officials after they began working together at the end of August. Ms. Warren\u2019s own staff had produced the initial outline of her proposal and began circulating it among a small network of economists and academics, both for input and, eventually, public validation. \u201cIt did kick into a higher gear after the last debate,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody\u2019s Analytics, whom the campaign has consulted on this and other policy proposals. The Warren campaign also tipped the progressive group Data for Progress about her proposal; it rushed a poll into the field on Oct. 30 and 31, and released its favorable results on Nov. 1, the same day as Ms. Warren\u2019s plan. The proposal, which would require an estimated $20.5 trillion in new federal spending over 10 years, immediately came under attack from Ms. Warren\u2019s rivals, chiefly Mr. Biden, who said \u201cshe\u2019s making it up.\u201d  His campaign manager recently warned that Medicare for all could cost Democrats the House. Ms. Jayapal, the Seattle congresswoman whom Ms. Warren called before releasing her plan, said it was a milestone to have a front-runner fully embrace government-provided Medicare for all. \u201cIt was tricky political terrain because it was Bernie\u2019s issue,\u201d said Ms. Jayapal, who has not endorsed a Democratic candidate. \u201cShe had to figure out a way to not step on that but also make the issue her own.\u201d At a campaign event in North Carolina recently, Ms. Warren delivered an emphatic rejoinder to those who said it was misguided and impossible to enact. \u201cYou don\u2019t get what you don\u2019t fight for,\u201d she said. Less than 30 minutes earlier, Ms. Warren had been asked to list the first three bills she would want to sign into law. Medicare for all did not make the cut.",

      "author": "Maggie Astor",
      "content": " It was a busy week in the Democratic presidential campaign, with a flood of new policies and, of course, another debate. Let\u2019s get right to it. There weren\u2019t a lot of sparks in this week\u2019s debate, the fifth of the Democratic primary. But in the absence of a clear front-runner, several lower-polling candidates were able to break through \u2014 at least for one news cycle. Senators Kamala Harris of California, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Cory Booker of New Jersey all had strong nights. So did Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., who did not face nearly as many attacks as expected in his first appearance since he shot to the top of the field in Iowa. Mr. Buttigieg has had a remarkable rise in Iowa, rocketing from 9 percent (fourth place) in a CNN/Des Moines Register poll in September to 25 percent (first place) in one released last weekend. Between that and a Monmouth University poll four days earlier also showing him in first place, it is clear that Mr. Buttigieg has become a serious contender there. The bad news for him: He is polling terribly among black voters. A Quinnipiac poll in South Carolina, where black Democrats are the most powerful voting bloc in the primary, showed him at 0 percent in that group. And while his current supporter base could be enough for him to win Iowa, which is mostly white, no Democrat in modern history has won the presidential nomination without winning a majority of black voters. After the debate, several candidates fanned across Atlanta to pitch themselves to black audiences. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts gave a speech at Clark Atlanta University on Thursday evening, saying that \u201crace-neutral laws\u201d were not enough, and that the government had an obligation to mend the damage caused by \u201cdecades of active, state-sponsored discrimination.\u201d She was joined onstage by Representative Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, who has endorsed her, and Ms. Pressley ended up speaking directly to pro-charter-school protesters who interrupted the speech. Earlier in the day, Ms. Harris held a \u201cblack women\u2019s breakfast,\u201d and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont gave a speech tying his family\u2019s experience in the Holocaust to the discrimination black Americans face. Mayor Wayne Messam of Miramar, Fla., ended his presidential campaign on Wednesday. If you hadn\u2019t known he was running to begin with, well, don\u2019t worry about it. Mr. Messam had never appeared on a debate stage, reaching only 1 percent in exactly two debate-qualifying polls all year, and had raised a mere $15,000 in the third quarter. \u201cI knew the odds were a steep hill to climb, but I have always fought for what is right and will continue to break barriers never broken,\u201d he said in announcing his withdrawal. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. introduced a wide-ranging plan this week to expand on the Violence Against Women Act. Among other things, it would create a new housing program for survivors of sexual assault and domestic abuse, require colleges and universities to improve reporting systems, establish a task force on online harassment and provide $100 million a year to end the backlog of untested rape kits. The proposal also focuses on survivors\u2019 ability to sue: It would ban mandatory arbitration clauses that block employees from suing over sexual harassment and restore a provision in the act that would allow people to take civil action against their abusers in federal court. The Supreme Court blocked that provision in 1999, and Mr. Biden is calling on Congress to pass a version that \u201cfills the gaps the Court found fatal last time.\u201d Mr. Biden was one of seven candidates who released plans this week \u2014 including Ms. Warren, who, as is her wont, released two. We will leave you with Ms. Harris\u2019s reaction after Mr. Biden, touting an endorsement from former Senator Carol Moseley Braun of Illinois, said he had the support of the only black woman elected to the Senate.",

      "subtitle": "5 Takeaways From the November Democratic DebateIt was a mostly bloodless evening among the 10 candidates onstage, but there were some standout moments.By Shane Goldmacher, Reid J. Epstein and Lisa LererPRINT EDITIONNovember 21, 2019",
      "author": "Shane Goldmacher",
      "content": "   With polls showing a highly competitive primary race and no clear front-runner, the Democrats in Wednesday\u2019s debate acted as if they had decided ahead of time to avoid taking risks or doing much of anything that might cause them to lose momentum at this stage of the campaign. It was not flashy. It might not be memorable. But it was revealing. Here are five takeaways: For much of the night, the showdown in Atlanta felt more like a candidate forum than a true clash of visions, as contender after contender seemed more than satisfied to go long periods reciting elements of their stump speeches, rather than contrasting with one another on policy. They disagreed politely with one another, and agreed repeatedly about the menace of President Trump. \u201cI think Joe is right,\u201d Senator Bernie Sanders said at one point to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. \u201cI just want to stick up for Tom,\u201d the businessman Andrew Yang piped up for the billionaire Tom Steyer. \u201cThanks, Andrew,\u201d Mr. Steyer replied. And so it went on  a mostly bloodless evening marked more by civility than caustic confrontations \u2014 besides, that is, Representative Tulsi Gabbard, who sparred aggressively with both Senator Kamala Harris and Mayor Pete Buttigieg, of South Bend, Ind., generating two of the three most tweeted moments of the debate, according to Twitter. A viewer tuning into this debate for the first time would be hard-pressed to say who exactly is the Democratic front-runner in the 2020 primary. Mr. Biden? Sure, he leads in all the national polls, but few onstage seemed eager to challenge him after others who\u2019ve targeted him \u2014 Ms. Harris in June and Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former housing secretary, who did not qualify for this debate \u2014 have faded afterward. Senator Elizabeth Warren? She sure seemed to look like the front-runner a month ago, when she was the object of most of the attacks. But not on Wednesday. The top four candidates \u2014 Mr. Biden, Mr. Buttigieg, Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren \u2014 all spoke the most but none of them suffered against sustained incoming. Hours before the debate, Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign had accidentally sent out a post-debate email that hinted of plans to take on Ms. Warren (\u201cWe need more than plans\u201d), but no such thing materialized onstage. The story of the debate was more of punches pulled than landed. A month after her rivals hammered Ms. Warren for a lack of \u201cMedicare for all\u201d specifics, her fresh $20.5 trillion package to remake the health care system received surprisingly little scrutiny. Mr. Sanders hit Mr. Biden at one point for his support of the Iraq war, but the moderators quickly moved on. Perhaps Mr. Biden\u2019s biggest swing of the night was aimed at an unusual target: dinging the low-polling Mr. Steyer for his past investments in coal. The evening before the debate, one of Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s top advisers, Lis Smith, posted a GIF about debate preparations for an onslaught of attacks to come. That did not happen, at least not until the final moments of the debate, and by then Mr. Buttigieg was settled in onstage. When Senator Amy Klobuchar took a swipe at him as a \u201clocal official,\u201d he was ready with the retort: \u201cThere\u2019s more than 100 years of Washington experience on this stage, and where are we right now as a country?\u201d When Ms. Gabbard accused Mr. Buttigieg of saying he wanted to send troops to Mexico, he brushed her aside. \u201cDo you seriously think anyone on this stage is proposing invading Mexico?\u201d he said. For a candidate who has now vaulted toward the top of the field in Iowa, Mr. Buttigieg skated through most of the evening with surprisingly little scrutiny. Ms. Harris was among those given a chance to take a shot at Mr. Buttigieg over diversity and his lack of support among black voters, but she mostly chose not to do so. Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s response showed his dexterity as a politician, pivoting to his own lived experiences as a married gay man who understood discrimination deeply and personally, if differently. \u201cI care about this because while I do not have the experience of ever having been discriminated against because of the color of my skin, I do have the experience of sometimes feeling like a stranger in my own country,\u201d he said. The Minnesota senator, who is on a slow but steady climb in Iowa polls, drew sharp distinctions between herself and the candidates she perceives as her most effective foils: Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Warren. In a debate devoid of any signature moments or significant rhetorical battles, Ms. Klobuchar delivered a performance designed to appeal to Democrats nervous about the party\u2019s leftward turn and unsure whether to hand the party to a 37-year-old executive of Indiana\u2019s fourth-largest city. \u201cI\u2019m not going to go for things just because they sound good on a bumper sticker and then throw in a free car,\u201d Ms. Klobuchar said. \u201cWe have an obligation as party to, yes, be fiscally responsible, yes, think big, but be honest.\u201d Her hope is that there are a lot of people in Iowa \u2014\u00a0 where Ms. Klobuchar has bet the future of her campaign \u2014 who are drawn to that message. She didn\u2019t back down when read her comments to The New York Times about Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s relative inexperience. Ms. Klobuchar said it\u2019s true that she believes the women running for president face higher standards than the men. Asked why her paid family leave proposal, 12 weeks, is less robust than what other candidates are offering, Ms. Klobuchar didn\u2019t apologize. And she even found an opportunity to deliver the best of the array of jokes she makes on the campaign trail. \u201cMy first Senate race I literally called everyone I knew and I set what is still an all-time Senate record,\u201d she said. \u201cI raised $17,000 from ex-boyfriends.\u201d For a candidate on the ropes, Senator Cory Booker, had an impressively strong evening. He landed a tough hit against Mr. Biden, delivering one of the most notable lines of the night when he wondered if Mr. Biden was \u201chigh\u201d for saying he opposed marijuana legalization on the federal level. \u201cMarijuana in our country is already legal for privileged people,\u201d Mr. Booker said. He argued that the party must nominate someone who can inspire black voters \u2014 a knock on Mr. Buttigieg, who has struggled to build support among communities of color. \u201cWe need to have someone that can inspire, as Kamala said, to inspire African-Americans to the polls in record numbers,\u201d Mr. Booker said. And he closed with one of the most direct pleas of the evening. Mr. Booker\u2019s solid performance in past debates hasn\u2019t been enough to change his fortunes in the race, and he is now at serious risk of failing to meet the polling and fund-raising standard necessary to make the December debate. \u201cKeep me on the stage,\u201d he all but begged, in his final statement. Afterward, Mr. Booker reported on Twitter that he had raised more online in the hour after the debate than on any previous fund-raising day.",

      "author": "Alexander Burns",
      "content": " LAS VEGAS \u2014 After spending months in anxious passivity, staking their hopes on Joseph R. Biden Jr. and little else, moderate Democrats appear suddenly determined to fight for control of their party in the 2020 elections. The shift in attitude has come in fits and starts over the last few weeks, seemingly more as an organic turn in the political season than as a product of coordinated action by party leaders. But each assertive act has seemed to build on the one before, starting with a debate-stage clash last month over \u201cMedicare for all\u201d and culminating in recent days with the entry of two new moderate candidates into the primary, Michael R. Bloomberg and Deval Patrick, and a gentle warning from former President Barack Obama that Democrats should not overestimate voters\u2019 appetite for drastic change. Most convincing to some Democrats may be the off-year elections this month in Kentucky and Louisiana, where moderate-to-conservative Democrats prevailed in governors\u2019 races that President Trump worked strenuously to win for his party. The victories bolstered the argument, advanced by some leading Democrats, that the party could peel away some of Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters in 2020 by avoiding \u201clitmus test\u201d battles and courting the political middle. \u201cClearly, factually, people who voted for Trump voted for our Democratic gubernatorial candidates,\u201d said Gov. Gina Raimondo of Rhode Island, a moderate who leads the Democratic Governors Association. She said Democrats could win those voters in 2020 with a \u201cmessage of unity\u201d and pragmatic promises on issues like health care and student debt. For months the Democratic race was defined in terms of which candidate could promise the most daring policy reforms \u2014 a contest in which Mr. Biden, the former vice president, was struggling to keep pace with Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont. As the most liberal candidates set the agenda, many in the party establishment squirmed, anxious about alienating moderate voters. Now the primary has become an increasingly jumbled contest, shaped by Democrats\u2019 competing appetites for visionary ideas, tactical realism and sheer political novelty. Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., appears to be harnessing those tensions to his advantage, at least in Iowa, where for the first time he emerged as a clear front-runner in a CNN/Des Moines Register poll this weekend. In Nevada, where more than a dozen candidates were gathered for the state party\u2019s \u201cFirst in the West\u201d dinner, Representative Dina Titus was holding up the Democrats\u2019 off-year victories as a reason for optimism heading into 2020. But Ms. Titus, who has not endorsed a candidate in the presidential race, urged the presidential field to be mindful of the \u201cmoderate Democrats in suburban districts\u201d who flipped control of the House last year. \u201cWe have just got to make sure that we appeal across the board,\u201d said Ms. Titus, who introduced both Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders at events this weekend. \u201cWe are a big-tent party.\u201d That proved to be true this month, at least in Louisiana and Kentucky. The Democratic victors in both states, Gov. John Bel Edwards of Louisiana and Andy Beshear, the governor-elect of Kentucky, ran on expanding health care coverage at the state level and largely avoided national issues, like impeachment. Mr. Edwards in particular positioned himself well to the right of the national Democratic Party, opposing abortion rights and new efforts to regulate firearms. No Democratic leaders believe either state will be in play at the presidential level in 2020, and few would argue that the party should shift as far to the right as Mr. Edwards in order to compete. But Representative Cedric Richmond of Louisiana, a leading supporter of Mr. Biden, said on Sunday that Democrats should take the election in his state as a sign that \u201cthe country is not as far to the left as people would have us believe.\u201d \u201cIf you look at Kentucky, if you look at Louisiana, it shows 2020 could be a very good year for Democrats,\u201d Mr. Richmond said, \u201cbut we have to read the tea leaves right, learn the real lesson of what these races are saying.\u201d Many Democratic voters still appear determined to find a Goldilocks-like option in the race \u2014 a candidate who both generates excitement and soothes concern about the general election, someone who promises sweeping change but appears capable of winning Republican votes. Ms. Warren climbed in the polls for months on the strength of her reform message and a mastery of policy that conveyed reassuring competence, but her poll numbers have slipped recently amid intensive scrutiny of her health care plans. Ms. Warren has attempted to allay voters\u2019 reservations on that front in recent weeks by pledging not to raise middle-class taxes to pay for her plans. She also described how she would prioritize improvements to the Affordable Care Act, including the creation of an optional government health-insurance plan, before attempting to create a single-payer system. Both Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders remain among the best-positioned candidates in the primary election, with distinctive appeal to young people and other voters seeking a large-scale redraw of the political system \u2014 an overlapping agenda that drew roars of approval at the \u201cFirst in the West\u201d dinner. At the dinner, both expressed disdain for incremental politics, with Mr. Sanders saying that \u201ctinkering around the edges just won\u2019t do what needs to be done\u201d and Ms. Warren dismissing more modest policies as \u201ca nibble here and a nibble there.\u201d Both are polling at or near the top of the pack in three of the four early primary states, including Nevada. And both are actively working to persuade voters that their approach is the better bet in a general election, including by appealing to voters who feel alienated from the political system. \u201cIf the best that Democrats can offer is business as usual after Donald Trump, then Democrats will lose,\u201d Ms. Warren said at a campaign stop here on Sunday afternoon. \u201cWe win when we have solutions for the problems in people\u2019s lives.\u201d Andrea Griffin, an elementary school nurse in Las Vegas, said she had been wary of Ms. Warren as a general-election candidate but came away feeling more confident after watching her on Sunday. \u201cI was a little skeptical about a plan for everything, but she has a pretty good grasp on what the major issues are and I kind of think that she might be able to get it done,\u201d said Ms. Griffin, 56, a former independent voter who said she registered as a Democrat two weeks ago. Ms. Griffin said she was also curious about Mr. Buttigieg, but had essentially ruled out Mr. Biden, explaining, \u201cI think America is not ready to go back to business as usual.\u201d While he is consistently leading national polls, Mr. Biden\u2019s vulnerability in the primary appears to come, at least in part, from his seeming inability to inspire Democratic voters. He is seen as a sensible and safe option, and a conventionally steady hand for the presidency. At the Nevada Democrats\u2019 dinner on Sunday evening, Mr. Biden urged primary voters to think cautiously: \u201cWe\u2019d better be real careful about who we nominate,\u201d he warned, \u201cbecause the risk of nominating someone who wouldn\u2019t beat Trump is a nation and a world that our children and our grandkids won\u2019t want to live in.\u201d For a good number of primary voters, that appeal is persuasive enough: At Mr. Biden\u2019s town hall-style event in Las Vegas the night before, Phyllis Lind, a retired health care worker who is becoming a substitute teacher, explained her thinking about the race in terms that conveyed her party\u2019s conflicting impulses. She said she was drawn to Ms. Warren because she was \u201cfor the common person,\u201d and to Mr. Buttigieg because he had personal charisma \u201clike Obama.\u201d But at the moment, Ms. Lind, 73, said she was firmly supporting Mr. Biden. \u201cWe need to have a candidate that is going to also get the moderate Republicans,\u201d Ms. Lind said. At the moment, Mr. Buttigieg seems to be claiming an inchoate space that lies between Mr. Sanders\u2019s ideological movement and Mr. Biden\u2019s unapologetically tactical approach to the election. But his rise in the polls has been chiefly confined to the earliest primary states, Iowa and New Hampshire, and he has not generated interest among African-American and Latino voters, cornerstones of the Democratic coalition. At the dinner in Nevada, Mr. Buttigieg repeatedly struck the theme of unity, pledging to \u201cbring together an American majority\u201d for Democratic policies. His prepared remarks also included a rebuke seemingly aimed at Ms. Warren: the text circulated to reporters had Mr. Buttigieg saying that no one should be \u201cwritten out of a particular political party\u201d because of a policy disagreement \u2014 an apparent allusion to Ms. Warren\u2019s recent barb suggesting Mr. Biden might be running in the wrong party\u2019s primary because of his attacks on the idea of single-payer health care. But Mr. Buttigieg did not deliver the line, instead saying he wanted support from people \u201cwhether you are a progressive or a moderate or what I like to call a future former Republican.\u201d Mayor John Cranley of Cincinnati, a moderate Democrat who supports Mr. Buttigieg, said he saw the shift toward Mr. Buttigieg as a function of voters\u2019 intense concern about defeating Mr. Trump. \u201cI think that it\u2019s clear Democrats are focused on winning,\u201d Mr. Cranley said. Pointing to neighboring Kentucky, the northern bulge of which houses the suburban bedroom communities of his own city, Mr. Cranley argued that Mr. Beshear\u2019s victory with right-leaning voters there could be a case study for the national party. To win there, Mr. Cranley said, \u201cYou can\u2019t have somebody who is to the far left on some of these issues.\u201d",

But it can give us the perspectives of some of the people with expertise on primary races: veteran campaign strategists, consultants and advocates from both parties. Here is a sampling of their reactions. Senator Kamala Harris of California, trying to stop her campaign\u2019s slide, got perhaps her best reviews since the first debate in June \u2014 the one that shot her up in the polls for a few weeks. Commentators were not unanimous on Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., \u2014 who has risen to or near the top of recent polls, especially in Iowa \u2014 but for the most part, they thought he did well under the increased scrutiny. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota earned praise for several responses, but most prominently her defense of her argument that she and the other women running would struggle to win support with Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s level of political experience. And Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey did well against former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts had the most speaking time of any candidate but did not make the biggest impression. But strategists and commentators generally said she and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont did what they needed to do to maintain their positions in the race, and both of them had standout moments \u2014 especially on impeachment for Ms. Warren and climate change for Mr. Sanders. In what has become a pattern, Mr. Biden drew good marks for his responses on foreign policy \u2014 consistently a strong point for him in debates \u2014 but groans for his responses on race.",

      "content": " DES MOINES \u2014 Pete Buttigieg continues to surge in Iowa, leapfrogging Senator Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. to hold a commanding lead among likely Democratic caucusgoers, according to a new poll from The Des Moines Register and CNN. The poll showed that Mr. Buttigieg, the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Ind., was the first choice for 25 percent of would-be Democratic caucusgoers, a significant increase from the 9 percent he held in September, when The Register last polled the state. The support placed him far ahead of the rest of the field \u2014 with the other three top candidates in a virtual tie for second: Ms. Warren at 16 percent and Mr. Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders at 15 percent. The results are the latest evidence of Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s strength in Iowa, where his moderate political views, plain-spoken style and military history have resonated in the early voting state. Since September, when he placed fourth in the Register poll, he has more than doubled his on-the-ground staff to over 100 and has opened more than 20 field offices. He recently completed another bus tour in the state. Speaking to reporters in Long Beach, Calif., on Saturday night during the state\u2019s Democratic convention, Mr. Buttigieg said the just-released poll numbers were \u201cextremely encouraging.\u201d \u201cWe have felt a lot of momentum on the ground,\u201d he said. His rise also suggests that voters, in Iowa at least, are increasingly favoring a centrist agenda \u2014 a view that has drawn two new entrants, Deval Patrick, the former governor of Massachusetts, and Michael R. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City, into the race this month. The poll results reflect the deep split within the Democratic Party over whether it is veering too far to the left to defeat President Trump. Speaking on Friday to a room of wealthy liberal donors, former President Barack Obama expressed concern about some of the policy ideas being promoted by some of the candidates, citing health care and immigration as issues where the proposals may not align with public opinion. Though he did not single out any candidates directly, his remarks were seen as an implicit criticism of Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren, two of the leading candidates who are pushing policy plans once considered too liberal, like \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d with the broader goal of \u201cpolitical revolution\u201d and \u201cbig, structural change.\u201d \u201cEven as we push the envelope and we are bold in our vision we also have to be rooted in reality,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cThe average American doesn\u2019t think we have to completely tear down the system and remake it.\u201d Ms. Warren, who led the Register\u2019s September poll, with 22 percent, fell 6 percentage points. Her poll numbers are now roughly what they were in June, when she was at 15 percent. Mr. Sanders, who suffered a heart attack shortly after the last poll results were released, climbed 4 percentage points. Mr. Biden, who has seen his standing in Iowa slowly slip, dropped 5 percentage points. In addition to identifying a new Iowa front-runner, the poll has once again delineated a clear divide between the top tier of Democratic candidates \u2014 Mr. Buttigieg, Ms. Warren, Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders \u2014 and the rest of the field. The next-closest candidate in the poll was Senator Amy Klobuchar, with 6 percent, followed by a cluster of White House hopefuls with 3 percent, including Senator Cory Booker, Senator Kamala Harris and Andrew Yang. Mr. Bloomberg, who has suggested he would skip the first four early nominating states, including Iowa, if he were to officially enter the race, was at 2 percent.",

      "content": " CORALVILLE, Iowa \u2014 Bernie Sanders on Saturday unleashed his most forceful rebuke yet of Michael R. Bloomberg\u2019s potential presidential bid, warning the former mayor of New York that he would not be able to \u201cbuy this election\u201d and chastising his plan to skip campaigning in the early states. Speaking at a rally in Coralville, near the liberal home of the University of Iowa, Mr. Sanders, the senator from Vermont, repeatedly addressed Mr. Bloomberg by name, almost daring him to enter a Democratic primary race that has already been in progress for months. \u201cOur campaign is going to end the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality which exists in America today,\u201d said Mr. Sanders, who was joined by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a standard-bearer of the progressive left. \u201cSo tonight we say to Michael Bloomberg and other billionaires: Sorry, you ain\u2019t going to buy this election.\u201d He also derided Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s intended strategy of bypassing the key early voting states where so many of the current candidates are devoting time, money and resources. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to get elected president by avoiding Iowa, by avoiding New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to buy this election by spending hundreds of millions of dollars on media in California. Those days are gone.\u201d Mr. Bloomberg on Friday took the first step toward a candidacy, filing paperwork to qualify for the ballot in Alabama. His looming entry into the race has underscored its fluidity while presenting the threat of a centrist competitor to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. As a leading progressive, Mr. Sanders could potentially benefit from a Bloomberg candidacy that siphoned voters from Mr. Biden. But Mr. Sanders displayed no eagerness to see Mr. Bloomberg in the race, and was quick to draw a direct contrast between their efforts, saying his campaign had the grass-roots support to win rather than billions of dollars in the bank. \u201cBloomberg can have his billions,\u201d he said, \u201cbut that is why we are going to win this election.\u201d The rally was Mr. Sanders\u2019s second public event of the day with Ms. Ocasio-Cortez of New York, who joined him on Friday for a two-day swing through the first-in-the-nation caucus state. During a rally in Council Bluffs on Friday, both progressive politicians largely avoided making any references to Mr. Bloomberg. Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s early moves, and his suggestion that he would follow the unconventional campaign strategy of skipping all four traditional early-state contests and instead stake his candidacy on delegate-rich primary states like California and Texas, has supplied fresh fodder for candidates like Mr. Sanders and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who are both campaigning on anti-elitist, progressive messages. Earlier in the day on Saturday, at a climate change forum in Des Moines, Mr. Sanders directed a more glancing blow at Mr. Bloomberg, saying the country needed \u201ca dynamic democracy \u2014 a democracy where all of us play a role in shaping public policy, not some billionaire who decides that he wants to run for president of the United States because he\u2019s a billionaire.\u201d Mr. Sanders also took a shot at Mr. Biden, who recently said he would be willing to accept support from a super PAC; his campaign, Mr. Sanders said, had no such financial vehicle.",

      "author": "Reid J. Epstein",
      "content": "  [Follow our live coverage of tonight\u2019s Democratic debate.] Ten Democratic presidential candidates will take the debate stage in Atlanta on Wednesday night, but the spotlight is likely to follow two contenders who have risen to the top of polls over the last several months: Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. Here is what to watch for as the candidates debate: Last month in Ohio, Ms. Warren took incoming fire from four different rivals. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Mr. Buttigieg led the attack against her health care proposals, Senator Kamala Harris of California made a disjointed plea for Ms. Warren to sign onto her call for Twitter to ban President Trump and Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii demanded to know how Ms. Warren was qualified to serve as commander-in-chief. Since then, Ms. Warren has seen her polling position diminish as she has sought to explain how she would finance \u201cMedicare for all\u201d beyond the \u201cI\u2019m with Bernie\u201d line that she offered earlier in the campaign. But the attacks against her haven\u2019t stopped. She remains a useful foil for Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg \u2014 along with Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota \u2014 as they jostle to be the standard-bearer for the party\u2019s moderate wing. Ms. Warren has shown no indication she\u2019s willing to give ground. During a speech to Iowa Democrats this month she used the word \u201cfight\u201d 21 times in 12 minutes. Her argument that the party will lose to Mr. Trump if it nominates a candidate who fears her bold proposals has become central to her campaign stump speech. Expect both dynamics to be on full display in Atlanta, though this time Ms. Warren will be prepared to defend Medicare for all in a more detailed fashion than she has demonstrated to date. For weeks, aggravation about Mr. Buttigieg among his rivals has been simmering. It\u2019s about to boil over Wednesday night. With the 37-year-old holding a commanding first-place position in the latest Des Moines Register poll, his opponents are ready to attack him. Ms. Harris said Mr. Buttigieg would \u201chave to answer\u201d for using a stock photograph from Kenya to illustrate his plan for African-Americans on his campaign website. Ms. Klobuchar has taken her quiet asides about his lack of experience to the Sunday talk shows. And Ms. Warren dismissed Mr. Buttigieg for running a \u201cconsultant-driven campaign with some vague ideas that are designed not to offend anyone.\u201d At the same time, the volume of opposition research being pitched by rival campaigns about Mr. Buttigieg has increased, focusing on 9-year-old friendly remarks about the Tea Party and his stewardship of the municipal government in South Bend. In previous debates, Mr. Buttigieg has easily parried attacks from his rivals \u2014 that task will become tougher as scrutiny on him increases. While Ms. Warren laid out a plan last week to pass a full Medicare for all system by her third year in the White House, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont said he\u2019d get it done right away. \u201cI will engage that struggle on day one of my administration,\u201d Mr. Sanders said Friday in California. \u201cNot put it off for several years.\u201d Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren, long ideological partners, have mostly avoided direct conflict on the campaign trail. But the Medicare for all issue affords each of them an opportunity to create political distance. Mr. Sanders can once again brand himself as the purest advocate for his political revolution. Ms. Warren, meanwhile, will have to navigate between appealing to the party\u2019s most progressive voters and not frightening away moderate Democrats by tying herself too closely to Mr. Sanders. The Democratic differences on how to fix America\u2019s health care system have consumed much of the airtime in debate after debate, and the coming clash in Atlanta is expected to be more of the same. In the last debate, Ms. Warren was hammered for lacking her own Medicare for all plan. She has since rolled out a comprehensive package that more moderate Democrats, like Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg, have said is unrealistic and unworkable. Mr. Biden has used health care to raise other questions about Ms. Warren, calling her an elitist with a \u201cmy way or the highway\u201d approach to governance. Mr. Buttigieg has been advertising in Iowa to promote his \u201cMedicare for all who want it\u201d approach, which Ms. Warren has said will not fundamentally fix the system. The recent Des Moines Register/CNN poll showed how divided the party is on the topic, with 36 percent favoring a Medicare for all plan that eliminates private insurance, 34 percent wanting a \u201cpublic option\u201d and 20 percent saying they preferred restoring provisions in the Affordable Care Act. Midway through the second week of impeachment gobbling the entire Washington news cycle, the presidential candidates would still rather talk about almost anything else. Yet it seems implausible \u2014 if not impossible \u2014 for Wednesday night\u2019s debate moderators to avoid asking the White House hopefuls about the House inquiry unfolding daily on live television. But what can the candidates say at this point? They\u2019re all for impeaching Mr. Trump. But while they know that wanting the president removed from office is the cost of entry for the Democratic primary, voters would much rather see a discussion about the sort of issues that are central to their daily lives: health care, climate change and the economy. Even Tom Steyer, the California billionaire who spent years on a campaign calling for Mr. Trump\u2019s impeachment, is talking about other issues on the trail. So expect to see the moderators quiz the candidates about the latest developments from Washington, as they then pivot to something else. Things are not going well for the California senator. Since the last debate, she has shuttered her New Hampshire offices. She has laid off staff and shifted resources from her Baltimore headquarters to Iowa. And she has continued a slide in the polls, which now show her closer to the bottom tier than to the top. The challenge is that Ms. Harris has already delivered one of the most memorable debate moments of the primary \u2014 her takedown of Mr. Biden on busing \u2014 but the bump she received quickly faded. She has since turned her focus on Mr. Trump in one debate, and challenged Ms. Warren to call for kicking the president off Twitter in another. She does not have a signature policy focus \u2014 she has called to cut middle-class taxes as a top priority \u2014 that seems ripe to pop. It is not clear what tack she will take on Wednesday evening (she could be among the many ready to pile onto Mr. Buttigieg), but the pressure to perform is strong.",

      "content": " CORALVILLE, Iowa \u2014 It was her first visit to Iowa, but Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez bounded onstage like she was speaking to a hometown crowd in Queens. \u201cAre you all ready for a revolution?\u201d she said, as rap lyrics in Spanish rang through the crowd. \u201cI sure am.\u201d Her question was a fitting prelude for the man Ms. Ocasio-Cortez was there to introduce: Bernie Sanders, who has been pushing a similarly insurgent message for decades. Like Mr. Sanders, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, the congresswoman from New York, spoke of solidarity. Like him, she name-dropped Franklin D. Roosevelt. \u201cWhen people try to accuse us of going too far left \u2014 we\u2019re not pushing the party left,\u201d she said, to raucous applause, \u201cWe are bringing the party home.\u201d On a two-day swing through Iowa this weekend Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and Mr. Sanders, the senator from Vermont, traversed the state in tandem, an unlikely duo separated in age by nearly half a century, spreading their ideology in an unlikely place. They held rallies in Council Bluffs on the state\u2019s conservative western edge and in Coralville, near the liberal home of the University of Iowa. They hosted a climate change forum in Des Moines. The trip was their first together since Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, 30, endorsed Mr. Sanders, 78, last month, a decision that immediately jolted the Democratic primary and injected fresh energy into his campaign. Less than three weeks after he suffered his heart attack, they held an enormous rally in New York City that both demonstrated his political strength and deflected attention away from his health and age. Now, as Mr. Sanders reboots his campaign and prepares for an all-out push in Iowa, he is on a quest to lure the progressive left to him and away from Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and to convince the country that they need a wholesale revolution rather than \u201cbig, structural change.\u201d In Iowa, having Ms. Ocasio-Cortez by his side could prove a powerful weapon, as he and Ms. Warren remain locked in an intense battle to win over progressive caucusgoers with political appeals and policy plans. Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign is confident that Ms. Ocasio-Cortez will help motivate young people, a group that was critical to his success in 2016 but is now also excited by Ms. Warren, as well as the entrepreneur Andrew Yang. His advisers are also betting that her support, and the endorsements of Representatives Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, will help counter the criticism that he is running a campaign that appeals only to white, young men. Indeed, Mr. Sanders and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez cut a striking image: An older Jewish man from Brooklyn alongside a young woman of color from the Bronx \u2014 the standard-bearer of the American left and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 \u2014 together in the Midwest to share their message of democratic socialism. Even Mr. Sanders, who takes politics more seriously than most, couldn\u2019t resist cracking a joke about their partnership. \u201cPeople sometimes say that Alexandria and I are an odd couple, that she is so old and I am so young,\u201d he said in Council Bluffs on Friday night. \u201cBut that\u2019s okay. I\u2019m not an ageist.\u201d At all of three of their public events in Iowa, the atmosphere was festive, with little of the paternal scolding that can sometimes characterize Mr. Sanders\u2019s speeches. There were no homemade signs \u2014 the campaign does not allow them, fearing they could block the view for TV cameras \u2014 but there was a silhouette of Mr. Sanders\u2019s head projected onto a wall in Coralville. Onstage, Mr. Sanders and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez clasped hands, raising them together \u2014 him beaming like a proud professor, albeit one who seemed to understand he might soon be eclipsed by his student; her commanding an audience that was at once rapt and ebullient. \u201cI cannot think of any member of Congress who has done more within one year to fundamentally transform American politics,\u201d Mr. Sanders said in Council Bluffs. Yet what remains unclear, even after her positive reception this weekend, is whether Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and the political ideology that she and Mr. Sanders embrace resonates beyond Iowa\u2019s more liberal pockets. Mr. Sanders is still running third in most polls, faces formidable competition from Ms. Warren for progressive voters and is likely to endure nagging doubts about his fitness right up until the first Iowans caucus on Feb. 3. \u201cIt plays moderately well in blue areas, but far less well in areas that voted Republican in 2016,\u201d said Steven Drahozal, the Democratic chair in Dubuque County, Iowa, which narrowly voted for Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton. \u201cThey have been painted as socialists, and that turns off many moderate and Republican voters.\u201d But if Iowans are used to seeing Mr. Sanders, they are less used to seeing Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, and several attendees expressed particular enthusiasm for catching their first in-person glimpse of her. \u201cEveryone loves Bernie and especially A.O.C.,\u201d said George Holtz, 18, as he waited for the rally in Coralville to begin. \u201cI\u2019m excited to see him but I\u2019m really mostly here for her.\u201d A student at the University of Iowa, Mr. Holtz said he was still trying to decide whether to caucus for Mr. Sanders or Ms. Warren. But he said that Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s support for Mr. Sanders was swaying him, particularly because of what it signaled about her appreciation for his policies to combat climate change. \u201cIf Alexandria is supporting him, then I feel like I should too,\u201d he said. His friend, Isabella O\u2019Connor, 19, was equally enthused about Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, even though she was an intern on Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign. \u201cI loooove A.O.C.,\u201d she said. \u201cA.O.C. is my role model. She inspires me in a way that I haven\u2019t seen. And that\u2019s because she is young and she is unapologetic and she is unafraid. I respect her so much.\u201d Before the climate change forum in Des Moines, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez canvassed for Mr. Sanders, going door-to-door to speak directly with caucusgoers. During her public appearances with him, she at times seemed to dazzle the audience with her stage presence and her elegant political phrasing. \u201cThis is not about something that we allow to happen to us,\u201d she said at the rally in Council Bluffs, which drew a significant number of people from more liberal Omaha. \u201cWe don\u2019t let this race happen to us. We don\u2019t watch the presidential race. This is not a movie. This is a movement.\u201d She also subtly hinted at her own political ambitions. \u201cI\u2019m here today in Iowa because I want to grow, because I want to learn,\u201d she said at one point. \u201cBecause I want to learn about your fight so that I can take that and stitch it together with the Bronx and stitch it together with Baltimore and stitch it together with rural upstate New York and stitch it together with our black brothers and sisters in the South.\u201d It was a message that left an impression with audience members like Vivian Banderas, a 27-year-old from Omaha, who said after the rally that she had \u201cstarted crying when Alexandria was talking about her story and her struggle.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s just amazing to see someone with that background up onstage,\u201d she said, calling the partnership between Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and Mr. Sanders a \u201cdream team.\u201d Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign boasted repeatedly about their crowds this weekend, saying he and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez spoke to thousands of people in their two days in Iowa. But nowhere was it more apparent than in Coralville on Saturday night which of the speakers many of them had come to see: As soon as Ms. Ocasio-Cortez finished speaking, people began to head out the door.",

      "author": "Jennifer Medina",
      "content": " LOS ANGELES \u2014 Three months before anyone starts voting in the Democratic primaries, advisers for Bernie Sanders are confident about the new voters they are registering in Iowa. They expect a decisive victory in New Hampshire, where Mr. Sanders, the senator from neighboring Vermont, is seen as a local. And in California, a state the campaign views as clearing a path to the nomination, they believe Mr. Sanders has a clear advantage with the not-so-secret weapon of Latino voters. Mr. Sanders has collected more money from Latino voters than any other candidate in the Democratic field, raising three times as much from the group as Barack Obama did in 2008. He leads among Latino voters in a set of new surveys conducted by The New York Times Upshot and Siena College, receiving 28 percent of the Democratic primary vote in six swing states. In fact, campaign advisers have made it clear: No other ethnic voting bloc is as important as Latinos. Mr. Sanders may be a 78-year-old white senator from Vermont, the state with the lowest Latino population in the country, but many Latino voters see him as the candidate who best embodies their hopes. \u201cT\u00edo Bernie,\u201d they often call him, as if he were an affectionate uncle or a family friend. They are loyal Bernie Sanders supporters and their adoration stretches back to 2015, during his first run for president. They have pored over old videos, delighting in the fact that his message has hardly changed in his decades in office. In his calls for equality, they hear echoes of their parents, some of whom immigrated for economic opportunities. \u201cWe\u2019re a community of struggle, and this is a man who knows struggle,\u201d said Anthony Mercado, a 48-year-old maintenance worker, who wore a \u201cBernie 2016\u201d T-shirt while sitting outside the East Los Angeles Sanders campaign office the day it opened last month. \u201cLatinos have been promised things and then the winds change. But he\u2019s been saying the same things ever since he started.\u201d In Iowa and Nevada, the Sanders campaign believes that even a slightly increased Latino turnout in the states\u2019 caucuses will deliver significantly more delegates to Mr. Sanders. And the campaign has several reasons to be optimistic. In 2016, Mr. Sanders prevailed in just one primary state where Latinos made up at least 15 percent of the population, but in several surveys of the 2020 field, Latino voters \u2014 expected to be the largest minority voting group \u2014 have indicated that they favor Mr. Sanders more than any other presidential candidate. In a recent poll of likely Democratic voters from the Public Policy Institute of California, a nonpartisan research group, 39 percent of Latinos in California said they prefer Mr. Sanders, compared to 21 percent for former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and 5 percent for Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. Latinos make up 24 percent of likely Democratic voters in the state, according to the group. The Sanders campaign has collected more money from Latino donors \u2014 both among individuals and total contributions \u2014 than any other campaign, raising four times as much from the group as the Warren campaign and five times as much as the Biden campaign, according to an analysis of ActBlue contributions by Juan M. Proa\u00f1o, the chair of Plus Three, a fund-raising and technology group. At a presidential forum sponsored by the League of United Latin American Citizens in Des Moines last month, Mr. Sanders spoke after Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former housing secretary, and Beto O\u2019Rourke, the former Texas congressman. Only Mr. Sanders received a standing ovation as he entered the room. In Los Angeles, a core group of Sanders volunteers from 2016 has stayed involved in causes they care about \u2014 successfully campaigning for a $15 minimum wage, marching with teachers during a weeklong strike for higher salaries and lobbying for Medicaid for undocumented immigrants. Now, they are further galvanized by President Trump\u2019s divisive language and hard-line policies toward immigrants. They are pressing their parents and their neighbors to join them, volunteering their Spanish at phone banks and organizing in the heavily Latino suburbs east of Los Angeles. \u201cIn most campaigns, Latinos are usually an afterthought \u2014 we\u2019re explicitly saying this is a cornerstone of our campaign,\u201d said Rafael N\u00e1var, the California state director for the Sanders campaign. Earlier this month, the campaign opened field offices in the Central Valley and the Inland Empire, two heavily Latino regions of the state that are often overlooked in national elections. \u201cWe\u2019re running the biggest operation in the biggest state, so we\u2019re going to do better than we did the last time.\u201d In 2016, Mr. Sanders captured 45.7 percent of Democratic voters in California\u2019s primary, compared to Hillary Clinton\u2019s 53.4 percent. The Sanders campaign office in East Los Angeles is tucked between taquerias in a small strip mall. During the October Democratic debate, it was filled with raucous energy \u2014 people in plastic folding chairs whooped with each jab Mr. Sanders took at the candidates surrounding him onstage. It had been just two weeks since Mr. Sanders had a heart attack, but whatever concern his supporters had seemed to quickly melt away. Far from seeing his age as a liability, many Latinos said in interviews they supported him precisely because they view him as an elder who deserves to be respected. \u201cI see him as the most honest candidate,\u201d said Esteban Shugert, 42, who had come to the party from his nearby home, eager to meet other Sanders fans. \u201cHe\u2019s not trying anything out for the first time. He\u2019s been fighting for the same things in the past.\u201d Campaign officials acknowledge that there is still something of a generational split, with supporters skewing younger. So organizers and volunteers are focused on outreach to older voters, many of whom primarily speak Spanish. Orianna Garcia, a 28-year-old production assistant, said she started a \u201cBoyle Heights for Bernie\u201d group because Mr. Sanders is unknown among many of her neighbors in the historically and predominantly Mexican-American area, particularly those who mostly speak Spanish. \u201cIn the older community especially, people will tell me they support Biden because they know who he is, but once I start talking about not taking corporate money and supporting \u2018Medicare for all,\u2019 they light up and are ready to flip,\u201d said Ms. Garcia who is planning a \u201cTamales for T\u00edo Bernie\u201d event in the area. Ms. Garcia said that despite holding steady jobs for the past decade, she has never received health insurance and instead relies on emergency rooms when she needs to see a doctor. \u201cThere is so much need for health care in our community,\u201d she said. \u201cIt costs everyone so much money that it gets everyone\u2019s attention.\u201d In interviews with Latino supporters in California and Iowa, many said health care was their top issue, pointing to parents who have gone bankrupt after surgery or have to travel to Mexico to see doctors. Even among members of unions that have fought to negotiate health care benefits, there is widespread enthusiasm for Mr. Sanders\u2019s Medicare for all proposal. Mr. Sanders has also taken some of the most liberal stances on immigration in the Democratic field. In an immigration policy plan released Thursday, he called for a moratorium on deportations and an end to Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids. He also promised to push Congress to enact a pathway to citizenship for all 11.1 million undocumented immigrants currently living in the United States. Mr. Sanders said he would expand executive orders to allow those immigrants to stay in the country until Congress changes existing laws. He has vowed to \u201cfundamentally restructure\u201d Immigration and Customs Enforcement, an agency that in 2002 he opposed creating. The plan also calls for ending family separations at the border and allowing asylum seekers into the country. Campaign officials have emphasized that three staff members who are Latino recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, shaped Mr. Sanders\u2019s immigration policy. \u201cWe made it very clear that immigration reform is not enough any more. We need to put a stop to deportations right away,\u201d said Bel\u00e9n Sisa, one of those staff members. \u201cTen years ago it would have been taboo for us to have influence over the policies that have impacted our lives.\u201d The campaign began its dedicated Latino outreach as soon as Mr. Sanders announced, Mr. N\u00e1var said, and held \u201cUnidos con Bernie\u201d events throughout the early voting states. In Iowa, the campaign has begun texting Latinos with a digital advertisement in Spanish about Mr. Sanders\u2019s family immigration history. Organizers in the state believe that they can drastically increase the number of Latino caucus voters; in 2006, less than 3,000 of the 85,000 eligible Latinos voted in the caucus. There are now more than 80 Latino staff members out of the roughly 400 working for the campaign, including Analilia Mejia, the national political director. \u201cWe have a cultural competency in everything we do because of that,\u201d said Chuck Rocha, a senior adviser for the campaign. \u201cWe were running paid ads targeting Latinos before we started reaching out to white people.\u201d In Des Moines late last month, Mr. Sanders received another round of loud applause as he touted his recent endorsement from Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat from New York and one of the most prominent Latinos in politics. \u201cIt gives me no pleasure to tell you what I suspect most of you already know \u2014 that we have a president of the United States today who is an overt racist, who is a xenophobe,\u201d Mr. Sanders began, before citing his own father\u2019s experience as an immigrant from Poland, \u201cfleeing anti-Semitism, fleeing terrible, terrible poverty.\u201d He added that his father \u201ccame to this country and like millions and millions of people became the proudest American that you have ever seen.\u201d Inside the East Los Angeles campaign office, a sign declaring \u201cUnidos con Bernie\u201d is tacked up next to a drawing of Mr. Sanders with \u201cmensch\u201d written in capital letters below. For the last four years, Carlos Marroquin, 53, a postal worker and activist, has been helping to corral what he calls the \u201cBernie Brigade,\u201d organizing Sanders supporters for all kinds of political causes. Now, he said, the group is seeing the benefits of never disbanding. \u201cWe didn\u2019t stop, just like he doesn\u2019t stop,\u201d Mr. Marroquin said. \u201cWe need to show people that he is the one talking about the things we care most about: incarceration, homelessness, housing, inequality. These are things we\u2019ve all demanded for a long time.\u201d",

      "content": " Senator Bernie Sanders wanted a show of force to convince voters he was back from his heart attack, and he produced one on Saturday: At his first rally since the episode just two and a half weeks ago, he reveled in one of the most coveted endorsements in the Democratic Party, from Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. Drawing loud cheers from a large, enthusiastic and diverse crowd that had packed into a park in Queens next to a public housing complex, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez offered resounding words of support, for both Mr. Sanders and his influence in shaping the Democratic primary. \u201cNo one wanted to question the system, and in 2016, he fundamentally changed politics in America,\u201d she said, minutes before Mr. Sanders joined her on the stage. \u201cWe right now have one of the best Democratic presidential primary fields in a generation and much of that is thanks to the work that Bernie Sanders has done in his entire life.\u201d Mr. Sanders declared himself \u201cso delighted\u201d that Ms. Ocasio-Cortez had thrown her support behind his campaign, hailing her as \u201can inspiration to millions of young people not just here in New York but across this country who now understand the importance of political participation and standing up for justice.\u201d Mr. Sanders said the crowd exceeded the 20,000 people the campaign had secured a permit for. Campaign officials, keen to affirm Mr. Sanders\u2019s resilience and mindful of the big crowd Senator Elizabeth Warren attracted to her rally last month in Washington Square Park, said more than 25,000 people turned out. During his remarks, Mr. Sanders also briefly and somewhat indirectly, addressed his health. \u201cI am happy to report to you that I am more than ready, more ready than ever, to carry on with you the epic struggle that we face today,\u201d he said. \u201cI am more than ready to assume the office of president of the United States.\u201d \u201cTo put it bluntly,\u201d he added, \u201cI am back.\u201d It was a theme that dominated the afternoon, as progressive activists and leaders paraded onto the stage to extend their own words of encouragement. There was his wife, Jane Sanders, who declared him \u201chealthy\u201d and \u201cmore than ready to continue his lifelong struggle to fight for the working people of America.\u201d There was Michael Moore, the filmmaker, who said he was \u201cglad\u201d Mr. Sanders was 78. \u201cWe will benefit from his wisdom.\u201d And there was Tiffany Cab\u00e1n, who nearly won the Queens district attorney race earlier this year; Carmen Yulin Cruz, the mayor of San Juan, and Nina Turner, a vocal supporter at his rallies on the campaign trail. Beyond serving as a show of strength, their presence aligned with a more unifying, inclusive message his campaign is aggressively trying to project. At the end of his address, he urged audience members to look around and find someone they didn\u2019t know. Then he asked a series of questions designed to promote a sense of unity. \u201cAre you willing to fight for that person who you don\u2019t even know as much as you\u2019re willing to fight for yourself?\u201d he asked. \u201cAre you willing to fight for young people drowning in student debt even if you are not? Are you willing to fight to ensure that every American has health care as a human right even if you have good health care? Are you willing to fight for frightened immigrant neighbors even if you are native born?\u201d Last week, the Sanders campaign announced that Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, who along with Ms. Ocasio-Cortez is one of the most prominent left-wing women in Congress, had also endorsed him. The pair of endorsements jolted the primary race, signaling that Mr. Sanders was still a formidable contender just as it had increasingly seemed like a contest between Ms. Warren and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. They also shifted the conversation away from his health issues and his age, infusing his campaign with a renewed sense of vitality. \u201cThere\u2019s been some degree of criticism over all \u2014 Bernie Sanders can\u2019t win because his movement is tapped out,\u201d Faiz Shakir, Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign manager, said. \u201cThis discounted that.\u201d But if the endorsements were an obvious indication that Mr. Sanders was not ready to surrender the party\u2019s left flank to Ms. Warren, it is not clear how much they will ultimately change the race \u2014 in part because there are signs that voters are not taking their cues from endorsements. Ms. Warren, for instance, has attracted huge crowds, posted some of the biggest fund-raising numbers, and surged to the top of national and early-state polls despite lacking endorsements from a single governor, big-city mayor or senator outside her home state. At the same time, Senator Kamala Harris of California is struggling to gain momentum even though she has the backing of politicians across the country, including her state\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom. Mr. Sanders\u2019s endorsements could inject fresh energy into a campaign that in some respects needed it badly. Consistently trailing Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren in recent polls and struggling to expand his base, he spent the last two weeks facing a barrage of questions about his health. His campaign made a show of financial strength this month when it reported it had collected $25.3 million between July and September \u2014 the most of any candidate in that period \u2014 but the announcement was quickly eclipsed by the news of his heart attack. Mr. Sanders\u2019s aides are also confident that the women will motivate young people, a group that was critical to his success in 2016 and that his allies know he must win over again, both in term of perception and for actual votes. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone would question or doubt that they, more than a lot of people, have the ability to inspire young people,\u201d Mr. Shakir said, referring to Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and Ms. Omar. \u201cThat in itself is going to be tremendous.\u201d The endorsements underscore how Mr. Sanders is striving to portray himself as the candidate furthest to the left. In recent months, as support for Ms. Warren has swelled, Mr. Sanders has unveiled policy proposals that have gone beyond hers \u2014 including plans to completely eliminate student debt and medical debt, and to impose a wealth tax that would apply to more households and is steeper for rich people than the one Ms. Warren has proposed. Several Democratic officials and strategists said the endorsements of Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and Ms. Omar \u2014 and possibly Representative Rashida Tlaib of Michigan \u2014 could stoke enthusiasm among the far left and perhaps prompt some of Ms. Warren\u2019s supporters to take a second look at Mr. Sanders. But some said the endorsements might not do much to grow his existing coalition, pointing out that the two women carry a similar anti-establishment, populist message that already appeals to Mr. Sanders\u2019s voter base. Some suggested the endorsements could even help Ms. Warren by making her appear more moderate and pragmatic in comparison with Mr. Sanders. Though Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and Ms. Omar have a big following nationally, and have become preferred targets of President Trump\u2019s, their support may not help woo voters, particularly in critical early states. Jess Morales Rocketto, a Democratic strategist who worked on Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign, said that the endorsements could give Mr. Sanders a fund-raising bump and more news media attention. But she was skeptical that the new support would sway undecided voters. \u201cI don\u2019t know that a congresswoman from New York, one from Minnesota, one from Michigan are super influential to voters in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina,\u201d she said. Mr. Sanders\u2019s allies said the visual imagery alone \u2014 an older man standing with younger women of color \u2014 could be enough of a benefit, especially as he continues to fight the perception that his voter base is skewed white and male. Cori Bush, who was endorsed by Ms. Ocasio-Cortez in her unsuccessful bid for Congress last year in St. Louis, said the endorsements from the two women \u201cknocks away that whole Bernie Bro idea.\u201d She also said their support \u201cwipes away the idea that maybe he\u2019s not the progressive champion anymore.\u201d Last month, the Working Families Party, an influential liberal group that backed Mr. Sanders in 2016, endorsed Ms. Warren. The announcement infuriated his supporters. But it also sent a message: It was time for progressives to pick a side and start organizing. Maurice Mitchell, the Working Families Party\u2019s national director, dismissed the notion that the dueling endorsements would splinter the left. \u201cWe\u2019ve said from the beginning that progressives need to get involved, and that\u2019s exactly what they did,\u201d he said, referring to Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and Ms. Omar. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing for our movement that folks choose one of these candidates.\u201d Mr. Mitchell said his group \u2014 which endorsed Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s opponent, then-Representative Joseph Crowley, in the 2018 primary \u2014 planned to marshal its network of volunteers across the country to work with voters to nominate Ms. Warren. What is less obvious is the role Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and Ms. Omar will play for the Sanders campaign. Waleed Shahid, the communications director for the progressive group Justice Democrats, which helped propel Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s congressional campaign, said the two women could mobilize their own networks of volunteers and donors. He pointed to Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s influence this year in the Democratic primary for district attorney in Queens, where her support for Ms. Cab\u00e1n helped to nearly lift her to victory. And because the two congresswomen represent the activist base of the party, he said, they could galvanize progressive activists around the country. But perhaps above all, the endorsements will help dispel questions about Mr. Sanders\u2019s viability post-heart attack, he said. Already, there are some indications the strategy could be working. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it makes him seem less old,\u201d Rashaun Durden, 29, said on Saturday as he waited for Mr. Sanders\u2019s rally to begin. \u201cBut I think it shows that the young generation still wants to support him regardless of his age.\u201d ",

      "author": "Maggie Astor",
      "content": " Loath as the candidates have been to talk about it, age is an inescapable subject in this Democratic primary: The three highest-polling candidates are all in their 70s, and one of them just had a heart attack. So it was perhaps not surprising that, about two hours into the debate on Tuesday, the moderators bluntly asked how Senator Bernie Sanders, 78, Joseph R. Biden Jr., 76, and Senator Elizabeth Warren, 70, could assure voters that they were up to the rigors of the presidency. The question was initially directed at Mr. Sanders, who had a heart attack two weeks ago and has been off the campaign trail since, except for a virtual appearance via Skype at a United Food and Commercial Workers International Union forum in Iowa. He has tried to turn his experience into a positive, using it to underscore his support for \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d In interviews during his recovery, he has spoken of his concern for Americans who, because of the cost, may not seek treatment when they experience the symptoms he did. Still, going into Tuesday\u2019s debate, his aides knew Mr. Sanders needed to convince voters of his strength and stamina to run against President Trump, 73. Here is a transcript of the exchange, including the responses from Mr. Sanders, Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren. ERIN BURNETT, moderator: Senator, we are all very glad you\u2019re feeling well, as you just said. But there is a question on a lot of people\u2019s minds, and I want to address it tonight. You\u2019re 78 years old, and you just had a heart attack. How do you reassure Democratic voters that you\u2019re up to the stress of the presidency? SANDERS: Well, let me invite you all to a major rally we\u2019re having in Queens, New York. BernieSanders.com. We\u2019re going to have a special guest at that event, and we are going to be mounting a vigorous campaign all over this country. That is how I think I can reassure the American people. But let me take this moment, if I might, to thank so many people from all over this country, including many of my colleagues up here, for their love, for their prayers, for their well wishes. And I just want to thank you from the bottom of my heart, and I\u2019m so happy to be back here with you this evening. BURNETT: Vice President Biden, if you\u2019re elected, you will turn 80 during your first term. Last month, former President Jimmy Carter said he could not have undertaken the duties of the presidency at 80 years old. Why are you so sure that you can? BIDEN: Because I watched it. I know what the job is. I\u2019ve been engaged. Look, one of the reasons I\u2019m running is because of my age and my experience. With it comes wisdom. We need someone to take office this time around who on Day 1 can stand on the world stage, command the respect of world leaders from Putin to our allies, and know exactly what has to be done to get this country back on track. It is required, now more than any time in any of our lifetimes, to have someone who has that capacity on Day 1. That\u2019s one of the reasons why I decided to run, why I decided to run this time, because I know what has to be done. I\u2019ve done it before. I\u2019ve been there when we pulled the nation out of the worst financial recession in history. I\u2019ve been there, and I\u2019ve got so many pieces of legislation passed, including the Affordable Care Act as well as making sure that we had the Recovery Act, which kept us from going into a depression. I know what has to be done. I will not need any on-the-job training the day I take office. And I will release my medical records, as I have 21 years of my tax records, which no one else on this stage has done, so that you can have full transparency as to my health and what I am doing. BURNETT: Just to be clear, Mr. Vice President, when will you release those records? BIDEN: Before the first vote. BURNETT: Before Iowa? BIDEN: Yes. BURNETT: Not by the end of this year? BIDEN: Well, before Iowa. I mean, look, I\u2019ve released them before. I released 55 pages of my \u2014 I\u2019m the only guy that\u2019s released anything up here. BURNETT: Senator Warren, like Senator Sanders and Vice President Biden, if you win the presidency, you would be the oldest president ever inaugurated in a first term. You would be 71. Forty percent of Democratic primary voters say they think a candidate under the age of 70 is more likely to defeat President Trump. What do you say to them? WARREN: Well, I say I will outwork, out-organize and outlast anyone, and that includes Donald Trump, Mike Pence or whoever the Republicans get stuck with. Look, the way I see this, the way we\u2019re going to win is by addressing head-on what millions of Americans know in their bones, and that is that the wealthy and the well-connected have captured our democracy, and they\u2019re making it work for themselves and leaving everyone else behind. And political pundits and Washington insiders and, shoot, people in our own party don\u2019t want to admit that. They think that running some kind of vague campaign that nibbles around the edges of big problems in this country is a winning strategy. They are wrong. If all Democrats can promise is after Donald Trump, it will be business as usual, then we will lose. Democrats win when we call out what\u2019s broken and we show how to fix it. Democrats will win when we fight for the things that touch people\u2019s lives, things like child care and health care and housing costs. Democrats will win when we give people a reason to get in the fight.",

      "content": " MARSHALLTOWN, Iowa \u2014 On a trip to Iowa in June, Senator Bernie Sanders confided in aides about a central gamble of his second bid for the White House. As nearly two dozen other presidential candidates and their supporters were heading to an Iowa Democratic Party dinner, the first major event of the 2020 election cycle, Mr. Sanders was on his way to march with striking fast-food workers. While such populist gestures have defined Mr. Sanders\u2019s life in politics, he was taking a risk in favoring grass-roots organizing over the party politicking usually essential to winning the Iowa caucuses, as he acknowledged in a car ride to the protest. \u201cThis is going to be hard,\u201d he said, according to an aide who was present. \u201cBut,\u201d he said, using a profanity for emphasis, \u201cthis is the only way we\u2019re going to do it.\u201d Every top Democratic candidate has been making calculations to try to win Iowa\u2019s first-in-the-nation caucus, and, lately, many have been staking their candidacies to a big result on Feb. 3. But Mr. Sanders stands out in several ways: He nearly won Iowa in 2016 against Hillary Clinton and, some allies say, he cannot afford to be anything less than a close runner-up again. He is returning to the state this week after suffering a heart attack that stirred questions about his campaign\u2019s viability. He has the most money in the race but also faces tough competition for liberal voters from a leading Iowa candidate, Senator Elizabeth Warren. And, as his solidarity with the fast-food workers showed, he is trying to strengthen his base of voters by dedicating time and resources to wooing workers, young people, Latinos and others in Iowa, rather than focusing on winning over more party leaders. It is something of a shift from 2016, when Mr. Sanders and his allies were a greater presence at Democratic Party dinners and events to try to compete with Mrs. Clinton. Increasingly, Mr. Sanders and his allies are making it clear that he is determined to win Iowa, even as he faces an uphill battle with about 100 days to go before the caucuses. \u201cI\u2019m here this evening to ask for your help,\u201d he said at a town hall-style event in Marshalltown on Thursday. \u201cI don\u2019t have to tell anybody in this room that Iowa plays a very disproportionately large role in the political process.\u201d Mr. Sanders continues to lag Ms. Warren and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. in polls. As candidates like Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., nip at his heels, his campaign has zeroed in on Iowa, viewing it as critical to his chances of winning the Democratic nomination, according to several people familiar with his strategy. Some advisers say a strong showing in Iowa \u2014 especially if he finishes ahead of Ms. Warren \u2014 would be enough to catapult him through New Hampshire and into Nevada and Super Tuesday. \u201cIowa has to be a top priority for the campaign \u2014 we need to do very well in the state,\u201d said Representative Ro Khanna, one of Mr. Sanders\u2019s national campaign co-chairs. \u201cI hope he can go there every week,\u201d Mr. Khanna said. \u201cHe needs to be in Iowa as much as possible.\u201d To that end, his campaign has recently reallocated resources to the state, including spending $1.3 million to air its first television ad this month. It has built out its Iowa team, naming a key communications aide as its deputy state director. The campaign has also expanded its ground operation, with 13 field offices and more than 110 paid staffers. Mr. Sanders returned Thursday for a two-day, five-event swing, and plans to be back next week to lead a \u201cmarch to end corporate greed.\u201d According to aides, his campaign is also discussing a trip to the state with Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who recently endorsed him. Mr. Sanders, however, has competition: Nearly all of the top-tier candidates have also signaled that Iowa is a top priority. Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign has publicly sought to lower expectations but he has been to the state three times this month and is planning another four-day swing there next week. Ms. Warren, whose campaign was among the first to establish a presence in the state, has 19 field offices. Mr. Buttigieg recently completed an Iowa bus tour. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota has made 21 trips to the state, including her own post-debate bus tour, and has visited 55 of the state\u2019s 99 counties. Senator Kamala Harris vowed to visit the state every week in October. The sudden flurry of attention represents a change from earlier this year, when White House hopefuls appeared to be embracing a more national campaign strategy that took them beyond Iowa and other early nominating states. The growth of social media, the changes to the electoral calendar and the increasing diversity of the Democratic electorate combined to make it seem like Iowa, a predominantly white state, might lose its sway in the primary process. \u201cUsually there\u2019s a ramp-up period in past presidential cycles,\u201d said Sean Bagniewski, the Democratic chair in Polk County, about the focus on Iowa. \u201cThis year, it was like a thunderclap.\u201d The stakes in Iowa for Mr. Sanders have personal and psychological dimensions. After his surprising performance in the caucuses in 2016, some aides said the state has taken on an almost mystical quality. A weak result could also indicate that he does not have the same influence with progressive voters as he used to. Despite a series of disappointing polls in the state \u2014 a Suffolk University/USA Today poll released this week showed him in fourth place \u2014 allies are confident he is still in a position to do well. Like it did in 2016, the Sanders campaign is betting on an extensive ground game that relies heavily on a vast network of volunteers that they hope will motivate other supporters to turn out on caucus night \u2014 including people who do not typically participate in the political process. His aides believe that the technique, known as distributed organizing, will help motivate unlikely or first-time caucusgoers, especially those who were too young to participate in the last presidential caucuses; Latino voters, whose turnout rate in the caucuses is typically low; and working-class voters. The campaign sees high potential for victory particularly in and around college towns, like Ames and Iowa City, and in rural areas. To solidify his base of support, he has spent hours rallying on college campuses in an effort to capture the support of young voters. He has courted labor support particularly in counties along the Mississippi River. And he has held multiple \u201cUnidos con Bernie\u201d events with Latino voters. With $33.7 million cash on hand at the beginning of October, he will likely have plenty of money to spend in the state going forward on staffing and advertising. (On Friday, his campaign plans to go on air with an upbeat new television ad, about climate and green jobs in Iowa.) Aides are sensitive to any comparison of the Sanders campaign of 2020 to the Sanders campaign of 2016: Unlike then, when voters only had to choose between him and Mrs. Clinton, they now have a wealth of options. To win in Iowa this cycle, he need only secure a larger percentage of the vote than his opponents. But he has struggled to expand his support in the state, and there are some signs it may be diminishing: According to a poll last month from The Des Moines Register and CNN, only 25 percent of those who say they caucused for Mr. Sanders in 2016 said they would do so again, while 32 percent said they would support Ms. Warren and 12 percent said they would support Mr. Buttigieg. In recent months, Mr. Sanders has begun holding smaller town hall-style events that give audience members the opportunity to share their own deeply personal stories. Advisers hope the events will inspire voters to work together to change what Mr. Sanders views as a broken system. (The campaign recently cut a television ad from one of these town halls in Iowa that featured a woman telling a horrific story about medical debt.) Mr. Sanders is staking his success on supporters like Morgan Baethke, 58, of Indianola, Iowa, who was one of about 100 people who came to hear him speak in Marshalltown, the first stop on a two-day \u201cend corporate greed\u201d tour. Mr. Baethke, who works in retail, said he tries to convince other voters to caucus for Mr. Sanders by knocking on doors and participating in parades and festivals. But he also revealed a fundamental tension endemic to the Sanders campaign\u2019s organizing strategy: He said that he prefers to speak to voters in a neighboring county rather than his own. \u201cI don\u2019t feel comfortable in my home county looking at customers who I deal with during the day, going to their house in the evening, knocking on their door and saying, \u2018Would you support Bernie Sanders?,\u2019\u201d he said.",

      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 Bernie Sanders\u2019s campaign plans to spend more than $30 million on TV advertising alone in the first four presidential nominating states and California, according to several people familiar with the strategy, a financial show of force that also suggests he needs to reach outside the traditional sphere of Democratic primary voters and caucusgoers for support. Mr. Sanders, the senator from Vermont, has been on the air in Iowa since early October, when his campaign spent $1.3 million on television advertising, and has bought $1 million of TV time in New Hampshire beginning Thursday. The campaign has so far largely flouted traditional politicking, wagering instead on robust on-the-ground organizing to bring new voters into the political process. But in earmarking tens of millions of dollars for television advertising between now and Super Tuesday in early March, the campaign is following a more established and analog path to accomplish what it says is the same aim. \u201cHe brings regular people into the process who are not currently participating,\u201d said Jeff Weaver, a Sanders adviser, who is leading the TV-centric strategy. \u201cYou need to be reaching people in a nonpolitical space. To find people who are not going to caucus, you have to be in spaces where they are, and that\u2019s on television.\u201d The campaign is producing its television ads in-house. The advertising blitz comes as two of his main rivals, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., have opened more field offices in Iowa than has Mr. Sanders. Instead, Mr. Sanders has built a network that allows supporters to connect with one another online, without going to a field office.  These same people are more likely to see his message on television, aides said. The campaign is also betting on a tactic that it used in 2016, known as distributed organizing, that relies heavily on a vast web of volunteers. The hope is that they will motivate other supporters, especially unlikely or first-time voters. Claire Sandberg, the Sanders campaign\u2019s national organizing director, said in an interview last month that her aim was to reach \u201call of the people who have given up on the political process and talking to them about what matters to them and then encouraging them to come out and vote.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re able to do that because we can reach a scale of voter contact that no other campaign can,\u201d she added. Mr. Sanders, who began his 2016 campaign relatively unknown outside of Vermont, spent more money on TV ads during that primary contest than any other candidate in either the Democratic or Republican race. \u201cThere were states where we would move 10 points, 20 points in a two-week period,\u201d Mr. Weaver said in an interview Wednesday, referring to Mr. Sanders\u2019s standing in public opinion polls. \u201cYou would add TV and it would spike almost straight up.\u201d Because Mr. Sanders already has near-universal name recognition among Democrats, his campaign\u2019s task in this primary is less about introducing him to voters than it is reminding those who backed him four years ago why they supported him. The Sanders campaign had raised a total of $61.5 million \u2014 more than any Democratic rival \u2014 as of the end of September, the last time candidates were required to report fund-raising numbers. The campaign also said it had $33.7 million in cash on hand, giving it a substantial war chest heading into the crucial early primary season. Doing well in the first four states is as important for generating momentum as it is for amassing delegates. That is particularly true for Mr. Sanders, whose surprisingly strong performances in 2016 against Hillary Clinton in Iowa and New Hampshire helped turn him into a real threat for the Democratic nomination. California and other states that vote on Super Tuesday, March 3, are rich with delegates that will determine the party\u2019s presidential nominee. A big TV buy could help Mr. Sanders with the demographics among which he is weakest: older voters who are the likeliest to be watching television without skipping the commercials. \u201cThey\u2019re doing very well with younger voters,\u201d said Joe Trippi, a Democratic consultant who managed the Vermont governor Howard Dean\u2019s insurgent 2004 presidential campaign. \u201cHe\u2019s going to break out among older voters who are not with him, and that\u2019s a TV audience.\u201d In recent weeks, Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign has been making it increasingly clear that it views Iowa as critical to his chances of winning the Democratic nomination. It has built up its state team and expanded its ground operation. It has similarly tried to display strength in New Hampshire: Earlier this week, Shannon Jackson, the state director there, sent a memo to supporters saying the Sanders campaign was \u201cin a strong position to win.\u201d The campaign, according to the memo, now has 14 field offices and 90 staff members on the ground in the state. Yet while much of Mr. Sanders\u2019s 2016 appeal was predicated on his being the lone alternative to the establishment choice, Mrs. Clinton, in 2020 he is competing with a field of 16 remaining rivals. Only one, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., has a plausible claim on widespread establishment support. In Iowa, Mr. Sanders has largely opted out of the cattle-call events that have drawn most of the presidential field, forgoing opportunities to make his case to both undecided attendees and supporters of other candidates who might be persuaded to pick Mr. Sanders as a second choice. In Iowa\u2019s caucuses, supporters of a candidate who fails to attain the 15 percent threshold for earning delegates may reassign themselves to another candidate. Mr. Sanders bought no tickets last weekend to the Iowa Democratic Party\u2019s Liberty and Justice Celebration, a huge annual political event in the state, nor did he take supporters to the Polk County Steak Fry in September. Both events drew more than 12,000 Democrats, and other campaigns used them as opportunities to demonstrate their organizational might and collect data on caucusgoers who could be persuaded to support their candidate. Mr. Weaver, who despite giving up the title of campaign manager remains Mr. Sanders\u2019s closest adviser \u2014 after the senator\u2019s wife, Jane Sanders \u2014 said it was unlikely that many attendees of either event would back Mr. Sanders in the caucuses if they already supported a different candidate. \u201cA lot of campaigns spent a lot of time in Iowa organizing sign brigades to stand outside events \u2014 that\u2019s a waste of an organizing event,\u201d he said. \u201cMost people who went to the dinner the other night were already persuaded one way or the other.\u201d",

      "author": "Reid J. Epstein",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Senator Bernie Sanders on Thursday called for ending virtually all of the Trump administration\u2019s immigration policies and creating a \u201cswift, fair pathway to citizenship\u201d for undocumented immigrants, including by allowing people who have been in the United States illegally for five years to stay without the risk of deportation. Mr. Sanders\u2019s immigration proposals are among the most progressive offered by a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate to date and, should they be enacted, would substantially reshape federal policy. If elected, Mr. Sanders would, on his first day in office, place a moratorium on all deportations until his administration conducted a \u201cthorough audit of current and past practices and policies,\u201d his campaign said. And he would seek to restructure the Department of Homeland Security, reassigning responsibilities for border enforcement, naturalization and citizenship and customs authority to other cabinet agencies. In so doing, he would \u201cbreak up\u201d Immigration and Customs Enforcement, as many liberal immigration activists have demanded, splitting its responsibilities between the Justice and State Departments. \u201cThe Trump administration\u2019s treatment of immigration exclusively as a criminal and national security matter is inhumane, impractical and must end,\u201d the Sanders campaign wrote. \u201cAs president, Bernie Sanders would make undocumented immigration a civil matter, and fundamentally reform the government agencies tasked with enforcing immigration law in a way that views immigration as a historically valued process that\u2019s woven into our country\u2019s fabric.\u201d Mr. Sanders, like his Democratic rivals who have articulated immigration proposals, said he would end President Trump\u2019s policies restricting funding to so-called sanctuary cities, allow asylum seekers to stay in the United States rather than having them wait in Mexico, halt family separations at the southern border and stop efforts to build a wall there. He said he would seek to double funding for immigration judges, though his plan does not specify where those funds would come from. He also said he would decriminalize unauthorized border crossings, making them a civil offense, an idea pushed by Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former housing secretary, in the first Democratic debate in June. Mr. Castro, who has released an extensive immigration plan of his own, tweeted Thursday that he was \u201chappy to see @BernieSanders join me.\u201d A President Sanders would not need congressional approval for the raft of executive actions detailed in his immigration proposals. But he would need Congress to pass any plan to offer amnesty to undocumented immigrants. The most recent effort failed in 2013 when the Democratic-controlled Senate passed immigration legislation hammered out by the bipartisan \u201cGang of Eight\u201d senators, but the Republican-held House did not vote on it. That proposal, which had backing from Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, helped torpedo Mr. Rubio\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign and served as the focal point of attacks from conservatives including Jeff Sessions, who would eventually serve as a key surrogate and attorney general for Mr. Trump. Homeland Security officials in the Trump administration have said that plans like Mr. Sanders\u2019s, which would forgo deportations for any undocumented immigrant who has been in the country for at least five years, could serve as a magnet for migrants from around the world, many of whom would have little trouble avoiding detection for that time. Unlike Republicans, Democrats have not made immigration policy a front-burner issue on the presidential campaign trail. The leading candidates all agree in their staunch opposition to Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration policies, with the border wall and family separation policies drawing particular ire. But in Iowa, where Democrats will hold the party\u2019s first nominating contest on Feb. 3, immigration policy has not drawn nearly as much attention as the debate over how to expand health insurance coverage, which has created a stark contrast between Mr. Sanders of Vermont and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts on one side and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., on the other. Ms. Warren has called for some of the same immigration priorities as Mr. Sanders, including decriminalizing the border. Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg have not offered detailed immigration plans and have not specified how they might change deportation policies. Chris Newman, the general counsel for the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, a pro-immigration group, said the Sanders proposal was the \u201cgold standard\u201d of progressive immigration proposals in the 2020 field. Yet he said it remained unclear how much emphasis Mr. Sanders would place on immigration policy during his campaign or in a possible presidential administration. \u201cThe big incomplete is whether he\u2019ll use the bully pulpit, whether he\u2019ll actually emphasize this,\u201d Mr. Newman said Thursday. \u201cThat\u2019s what was missing in 2016. He had great words on paper in 2016 but he didn\u2019t emphasize this issue.\u201d",

Mr. Sanders, of Vermont, was the only candidate to sit for an in-person interview with the union to seek its endorsement; Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts called in on a video chat and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., sent a three-minute video. Union officials said they had invited former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Kamala Harris of California to interview but each declined to do so. Ms. Warren, another leading candidate for the nomination and Mr. Sanders\u2019s top progressive rival, has also laid out a sweeping plan for single-payer health insurance, but the union stuck with the original architect of Medicare for all. \u201cWe enjoyed the difficulty this time around because last time the field was so barren\u201d aside from Mr. Sanders, Ms. Ross said. The endorsement also brings Mr. Sanders the support of the union\u2019s super PAC, a thorny issue given that Mr. Sanders, like most of the Democrats seeking the party\u2019s 2020 nomination, has disavowed support from super PACs. In 2016 the union\u2019s super PAC spent $5 million backing Mr. Sanders in the primary contest against Hillary Clinton, a relative pittance in the world of super PACs (the one supporting Jeb Bush blew through $87 million). Still, it spent more money backing Mr. Sanders than was spent by any other super PAC on behalf of Mrs. Clinton or other Democrats in the run-up to the Iowa caucuses. The union\u2019s super PAC \u201cwill be activated\u201d on behalf of Mr. Sanders, said Bonnie Castillo, the union\u2019s executive director. But she said union members and the super PAC would not attack Mr. Sanders\u2019s rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination. \u201cWe\u2019re not going negative,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are a very positive force. It\u2019s a reflection of who we are as a profession. We are healers.\u201d When talking to voters, Mr. Sanders often rails against the influence of money in politics, vowing to overturn the Supreme Court\u2019s Citizens United ruling in 2010 that opened the super PAC era in American politics. Since Mr. Biden dropped his resistance last month to receiving the support of such groups, Mr. Sanders has become more pointed. \u201cI don\u2019t need a super PAC,\u201d he said during a town hall-style event last month in Marshalltown, Iowa, in response to a question from the audience about Mr. Biden. \u201cI am not going to be controlled by a handful of wealthy people. I will be controlled by the working people of this country.\u201d This weekend, he continued the theme, saying, \u201cWe don\u2019t have a super PAC,\u201d at a rally in Coralville, Iowa. But Mr. Sanders did not disavow support from the nurses\u2019 union\u2019s super PAC in 2016, even as he pointed out that he did not have a super PAC of his own. On Monday, Mr. Sanders thanked the nurses\u2019 union for its support but did not address its super PAC. \u201cWhat the nurses understand is that the current health care system is not only dysfunctional but extraordinarily cruel,\u201d Mr. Sanders said in a statement relayed by his campaign. \u201cTogether we are finally going to do what should have been done decades ago and make sure that every man, woman and child in this country has quality health care as a human right.\u201d Few major labor unions, typically significant players in Democratic Party politics, have endorsed candidates in the 2020 presidential contest. Mr. Biden kicked off his campaign in a Teamsters hall with the endorsement of the International Association of Fire Fighters. The United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America backed Mr. Sanders in August. The National Union of Healthcare Workers endorsed both Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren in September. National Nurses United was born out of a 2009 merger of three smaller unions. The organization, with about 155,000 members, is a staunch proponent of liberal politics and movement-building in the Sanders mold. The union\u2019s nurses were active in providing health care to protesters at the Occupy Wall Street encampment in Lower Manhattan in 2011, and the organization has lobbied forcefully for single-payer health care and a financial transaction tax. Deborah Burger, a union co-president, said if Mr. Sanders did not win the primary the union was committed to fighting for whoever wins the party\u2019s nomination against President Trump. \u201cWe have made a commitment to endorse Bernie Sanders,\u201d she said. \u201cBut in the end we have made a commitment to our communities that we live in that we will do whatever it takes to defeat Donald Trump.\u201d",

      "content": " DES MOINES \u2014 Before a campaign event last month, Bernie Sanders and his wife, Jane, went for an hourlong stroll around Green Castle Recreation Area, a lush park in central Iowa with evergreen trees and a small lake. Mr. Sanders also walked around a residential neighborhood in Waterloo recently, prompting curious passers-by to ask him what on earth he was doing there. Ms. Sanders is ensuring that her husband is getting adequate rest, and he has been requesting fish for dinner instead of steak or ribs. \u201cI\u2019ve noticed him ordering a heck of a lot more salads,\u201d said Faiz Shakir, Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign manager. Some allies, aware that Mr. Sanders can appear rumpled, have even urged him to dress better \u2014 he has been wearing more stylish sweaters \u2014 and to rein in his previously unkempt hair. In the six weeks since he suffered a heart attack while campaigning in Las Vegas, Mr. Sanders has been working hard to move past his health issues, adhering to a newly wholesome regimen that has included more exercise and a healthier diet. His recuperative program has coincided with a vigorous push to reboot his campaign: Buoyed by an enormous rally in New York City and the endorsements of three prominent young liberal congresswomen, including Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, his campaign has enjoyed fresh momentum heading into the final stretch before the primary contests begin. Yet Mr. Sanders, 78, is still trying to rekindle the magic of his last presidential bid, as he struggles to expand his base in the crucial early states of Iowa and New Hampshire, both places that helped propel him against Hillary Clinton in 2016. He and his team recognize that his ability to beat his chief ideological rival, Elizabeth Warren, and the rest of the leading candidates depends in part on whether he can convince voters that his age, and his health, is not an issue. \u201cIf people were on the fence at any point, they probably went to Warren after Sanders\u2019s health scare,\u201d said Bryce Smith, the Democratic chairman in Dallas County, Iowa. In Iowa and nationally, Mr. Sanders remains in the top-tier of Democratic candidates, though at different levels. A poll of likely Democratic caucusgoers released Nov. 1 by The New York Times and Siena College showed Mr. Sanders in second place in Iowa, only slightly behind Ms. Warren. A Monmouth poll released Tuesday showed him in fourth place in the state. The Times/Siena poll also showed him running third nationally, behind Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Ms. Warren, and leading with some voter groups, like Hispanics and those between ages 18 and 29. Many of his supporters dismiss the notion that his age is a vulnerability, brushing off the fact that he would be the oldest president ever elected. Younger fans, one of his biggest bases of support, often say with affection that he reminds them of their grandfather or uncle. His main opponents are, for the most part, also not young. Mr. Biden, who has faced questions about his own age, is 76. Ms. Warren is 70. President Trump is 73. (On the other hand, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., who is surging in Iowa, is 37.) When he is asked about his heart attack, Mr. Sanders says he is \u201cfeeling great.\u201d At rallies and town hall-style gatherings over the last several weeks, he has appeared livelier and more genial, and has even cracked the occasional one-liner to make light of his condition; during a rally with Ms. Ocasio-Cortez in Council Bluffs, Iowa, last week, he joked that some people thought the two of them made an \u201codd couple\u201d because \u201cshe is so old and I am so young.\u201d Despite suggesting that he would slow the pace of his campaign while recovering, he often holds multiple events a day. But he and his advisers are also mindful that he is under more scrutiny than ever before, and he has acknowledged that voters would likely consider his health when deciding whether to support him. His campaign has said he would release his health records by the end of the year but he has yet to do so, and it remains unclear how much damage his heart attack caused. Democratic voters have expressed some reservations about Mr. Sanders\u2019s condition following his heart attack. A recent poll conducted by The Washington Post and ABC News found that only 48 percent of respondents said Mr. Sanders was in good enough health to serve as president, compared with 74 percent for Mr. Biden and 80 percent for Ms. Warren. \u201cI do think his age is playing into peoples\u2019 decision, as well as perceived electability,\u201d said Rachel Bly, the Democratic chairwoman in Poweshiek County, Iowa. Ms. Warren, she added, was \u201cseen as more electable.\u201d With that in mind, Mr. Sanders has displayed newfound determination to prove his resilience, an objective that has meant balancing his rehabilitation with concrete steps to show he has the energy, and endurance, to go the distance. Previously known to enjoy diner food and meals at Outback Steakhouse while on the campaign trail, Mr. Sanders \u2014 with prodding from Ms. Sanders, who often travels with him \u2014 is eating more nutritiously, often asking at restaurants if they have grilled fish. He recently ate a vegan breakfast. His most common order at Panera, a lunchtime go-to on the road, is soup and a salad. \u201cWe\u2019re getting better eating habits and making sure we can maintain them on the road,\u201d Ms. Sanders said in an interview last month. \u201cFor him and for me, and for everybody else on the campaign.\u201d He has also incorporated more physical activity into his routine, frequently asking staffers to schedule time for a walk between campaign stops. The fashion-minded have noticed the upgrade to his wardrobe: Esquire magazine recently praised his look, writing that his knitwear in particular was \u201csmart enough for a formal dress code, but softens the angles of a tailored suit.\u201d And while he has long been reluctant to speak about his age, he has begun to embrace it, arguing that it gives him the upper hand. \u201cI\u2019ve been criticized for being old,\u201d he said at a campaign stop in Marshalltown, Iowa, three weeks ago, his first since his heart attack. \u201cI plead guilty. I am old. But there are some advantages of being old.\u201d Among Democrats, Mr. Sanders\u2019s health has become a popular topic. \u201cYou\u2019re electing a leader, and you want that person to be around for another four years or eight years to do the job that you\u2019re electing him to do,\u201d said Martha Wilding, 55, a school librarian from Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Karen Carver, 74, Ms. Wilding\u2019s friend, said she worried health concerns could distract a president from focusing on the job, noting that voters had plenty of other options. Mr. Sanders\u2019s health, she said, \u201cmight not be so much of an issue if there weren\u2019t so many other people who are qualified.\u201d Running for president is not the regimen typically prescribed by doctors after their patients suffer heart attacks. \u201cIdeally, we like to say, \u2018avoid stress,\u2019\u201d said Dr. Eric Peterson, a professor of cardiology at Duke University. \u201cBut that\u2019s not going to be possible this election.\u201d Beyond that, he said patients are typically told to take at least two weeks off after a heart attack; they are then instructed to take preventive medication and to follow a formal program for cardiac rehab that includes monitoring and lifestyle modifications. Mr. Sanders\u2019s aides and advisers have admitted privately that they were uncertain about the future of his candidacy immediately after his heart attack. But they now insist he has not lost a step, and point out that he is doing well in polls and drawing large crowds. His campaign moved the location of a rally earlier this month with Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, who has also endorsed him, to accommodate a larger-than-expected audience. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing a very comfortable Bernie Sanders,\u201d Mr. Shakir, the campaign manager, said. \u201cHe\u2019s having fun campaigning. There\u2019s something about having gone through the heart incident he did that I think has made him, even more so, appreciate the joys of campaigning, and it\u2019s also centered him more firmly on why he\u2019s running.\u201d One other benefit of Mr. Sanders\u2019s health scare: the voters who can relate. When told Ms. Sanders would like her husband to eat more vegetables, Ken Ramstad, 64, of Cedar Rapids, said he knew the feeling. \u201cMy wife,\u201d he said, \u201cdoes too.\u201d",
