      "content": "video platformvideo managementvideo solutionsvideo player Former Vice President Dick Cheney said that Sarah Palin was not ready to be his successor and that picking her was \u201ca mistake\u201d that Mitt Romney should seek to avoid in making his choice. Speaking to Jonathan Karl of ABC News in his first interview since undergoing heart transplant surgery in March, Mr. Cheney said Senator John McCain\u2019s choice of Ms. Palin, then governor of Alaska, clearly reflected considerations other than her ability to serve as vice president. Mr. Karl asked whether a presidential candidate should consider how well a vice presidential nominee might appeal in a particular state or to a demographic group. \u201cThose are important issues, but they should never be allowed to override that first proposition. That was one of the problems McCain had,\u201d Mr. Cheney said. \u201cI like Gov. Palin. I\u2019ve met her. I know her,\u201d Mr. Cheney said, calling Ms. Palin an \u201cattractive candidate\u201d in 2008. \u201cBut based on her background, she had only been governor for, what, two years? I don\u2019t think she passed that test of being ready to take over. And I think that was a mistake.\u201d Mr. Cheney has been an outspoken critic of President Obama, but has been silent amid health troubles in the past year. He received a heart transplant in March and has been recovering at his home in Jackson Hole, Wyo. Mr. Karl interviewed him there. The full interview will be shown Monday on ABC news programs. In the brief excerpt shown on Sunday, Mr. Cheney did not criticize Mr. Obama. But Mr. Karl hinted that the former vice president does not hold back in the rest of the interview. \u201cNo question: Cheney is back. He feels much better,\u201d Mr. Karl said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d program. \u201cHe says he hasn\u2019t felt this good for years. And he is certainly not holding back. You\u2019ll hear what he said about Obama \u2014 some of his harshest criticism yet tomorrow.\u201d Update: Mr. Cheney\u2019s comments about Sarah Palin drew some respectful objections from one expected source \u2014 and one that was unexpected. Mr. McCain defended his choice Monday on Fox\u2019s \u201cFox & Friends\u201d program, saying that he remains proud of Ms. Palin. \u201cI\u2019m always glad to get comments four years later,\u201d Mr. McCain said on the show Monday morning. \u201cLook, I respect the vice president. He and I had strong disagreements as to whether we should torture people or not. I don\u2019t think we should have.\u201d But he added: \u201cBut the fact is that I\u2019m proud of Sarah Palin, I\u2019m proud of the job she did, I\u2019m proud of the job she continues to do.\u201d But Mr. Cheney\u2019s comments about the selection of Ms. Palin also drew a mild rebuke from none other than his daughter. In a tweet, Liz Cheney defended Ms. Palin\u2019s credentials to be president. \u201cRarely do I disagree with best VP ever but @SarahPalinUSA more qualified than Obama and Biden combined. Huge respect 4 all she\u2019s done 4 GOP,\u201d Ms. Cheney tweeted.",

      "content": "Sarah Palin\u2018s political action committee raised $1.65 million in the first six months of 2011 and spent about the same amount, the PAC reported on Thursday.   Ms. Palin, the former Alaska governor, received 36,700 contributions from 24,000 people, according to Tim Crawford, the PAC\u2019s treasurer. They contributed more than twice what Ms. Palin raised in the same period in 2009. \u201cWe at Sarah PAC are very pleased and grateful for the tremendous support that Governor Palin receives from everywhere across our country,\u201d Mr. Crawford said. Ms. Palin\u2019s ability to raise money is being closely watched as she mulls whether or not to jump into the 2012 presidential contest. She said on Fox this week that she would make a decision sometime in August or September. If she were to run, she would not be able to transfer any money from her PAC to a presidential committee. Ms. Palin spent $1.59 million in the first half of the year, though Mr. Crawford did not say how that money was spent. This spring, Ms. Palin began her \u201cOne Nation\u201d bus tour to historical locations across the country. Mr. Crawford said her PAC had $1.4 million in cash on hand. He said the PAC contributed $65,000 to other candidates in 2011 and donated $18,700 to the Young America\u2019s Foundation, a conservative group.",

      "content": "Talking Georgia With Kissinger | 4 p.m. Gov. Sarah Palin wrapped her first day of motorcade diplomacy with a 90-minute meeting with Henry Kissinger, where they spoke about Georgia. Ms. Palin and Mr. Kissinger sat on blue couches, separated by an end table with photographs of President Nixon and President Reagan on it. As photographers were led in, Mr. Kissinger could be heard saying that he gave someone \u201ca lot of credit for what he did in Georgia,\u201d according to a reporter who was allowed to watch. \u201cGood, good,\u2019\u2019 Ms. Palin said. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll give me more insight on that, also, huh? Good.\u201d The photographers were ushered out. When Ms. Palin emerged from the building, a news producer asked her how it went, and she mouthed the words, \u201cIt was great.\u201d Meeting Uribe | 2:20 p.m.: The next stop on Governor Palin\u2019s whirlwind diplomatic tour was a meeting with President Alvaro Uribe of Colombia. Mr. Uribe has a warm relationship with Senator John McCain, who paid him a visit during extremely unusual campaign trip to Colombia over the summer where he expressed support for a free trade agreement. The meeting was held in the residence of the Colombian Mission on the Upper East Side in an ornate room with a pink stuffed chair and a chandelier, according to an account provided by the reporter allowed to accompany her into the event, Ms. Palin was overheard telling Mr. Uribe, \u201cThank you for your work.\u2019\u2019 Then the motorcade left for a sit-down at Kissinger Associates.  Palin and Karzai Bond Over Children  | 1 p.m. When Gov. Sarah Palin sat down with President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan on Tuesday afternoon, the polite preliminaries to their conversation centered around children, as Mr. Karzai spoke of the birth of his first child last year. \u201cWhat is his name?\u201d Ms. Palin was heard to ask, as she met with Mr. Karzai in the suite of a midtown hotel, according to a pool report. \u201cMirwais,\u201d Mr. Karzai replied. \u201cMirwais, which means, \u2018The Light of the House.\u2019\u201d \u201cOh nice,\u201d Palin responded. \u201cHe is the only one we have,\u201d Mr. Karzai said. Then the pool of journalists was escorted out, and the meeting began. Accompanying Ms. Palin were Randy Scheunemann, a senior foreign policy adviser for the McCain campaign, and Steve Biegun, a former staff member of President Bush\u2019s National Security Council who is advising Ms. Palin. Update | 12:17 p.m.:    Word now is that a print reporter will be allowed in at the next two meetings. Stayed tuned for updates on all the handshakes and pleasantries\u2026 Update | 12:02 p.m.: The campaign is relenting and letting in the television producer, so the camera crew will be going as well. But print reporters are up in arms about being excluded. Media Rebellion: Live from New York, it\u2019s Gov. Sarah Palin\u2019s top-secret foreign policy tutorial! Ms. Palin, the Republican vice-presidential nominee, is scheduled to meet Tuesday in New York with President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan, President Alvaro Uribe of Colombia, and former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger. But the McCain-Palin campaign\u2019s sharp limitations on coverage of the meetings have sparked a mini-revolt \u2013 and a threatened boycott \u2014 among the press corps. The campaign plans to bar print reporters from the meetings, and to limit coverage to brief photo-ops for a still photographer and a television camera. The television stations, though, are objecting, noting that they have a policy of not sending cameras to cover events without a producer, who provided editorial guidance. A stand-off has ensued, with the networks threatening not to send cameras. The newspapers are trying to get back into the act as well. It is not uncommon for meetings with world leaders to be pooled, but in the past the McCain campaign has at times allowed print reporters and televisions producers to look in and report any color \u2013 or exchange of pleasantries, usually banal \u2013 that occurs.",

      "content": "TAMPA, Fla. \u2014 The joke was, it seemed, a little awkward. Sarah Palin, the 2008 Republican vice-presidential nominee, was scheduled to campaign on Donald J. Trump\u2019s behalf Monday in Florida, but she had canceled to return to Alaska after her husband, Todd, was hospitalized in a snow machine accident. But Ms. Palin, the former governor of Alaska, still managed to appear with Mr. Trump at his event here, and in response to a question from the audience about the Second Amendment, Mr. Trump invoked both her and her husband. Referring to the terrorist attacks of San Bernardino, Calif., Mr. Trump said the situation might have unfolded differently had others in the room been armed. \u201cIf Todd Palin were in that room, frankly, if Sarah Palin were in the room \u2014 forget about Todd, especially now,\u201d Mr. Trump said, seeming to refer to Mr. Palin\u2019s hospitalization. \u201cIf Sarah Palin were in that room, if somebody were in that room that had a gun of some kind, attached to the hip, attached to the ankle, with bullets that could fly in the opposite direction, you wouldn\u2019t have this,\u201d Mr. Trump concluded. There seemed to be no hard feelings, with Mr. Trump thanking Ms. Palin at the end of his speech and telling her to \u201cget home to that incredible husband.\u201d And Ms. Palin did her part to excite the crowd when she spoke before the New York businessman. She referred to the rash of protests that have increasingly started to disrupt Mr. Trump\u2019s events recently, with one ending in violence and another leading him to shut down a rally in Chicago on Friday evening. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t have time for is all that petty punk-ass little thuggery stuff that\u2019s been going on with these quote unquote protesters, who are doing nothing but wasting your time and trying to take away your First Amendment rights, your rights to assemble peacefully,\u201d Ms. Palin said. Then, she turned her attention to another favorite target of Mr. Trump \u2014 reporters. \u201cAnd the media being on the thug side, what the heck are you guys thinking, media?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d",

      "content": "1:09 p.m. | Updated  DES MOINES \u2014 Sarah Palin arrived at the Iowa State Fair even as Rick Santorum was speaking on the fair soap box and Tim Pawlenty was grilling pork on a stick. Ms. Palin came, reportedly in a black Suburban, to the cattle barn \u2014 and was immediately surrounded by a crush of reporters and fairgoers. \u201cWho is it?\u201d people asked as the huge crowd moved through the barn. Original Post Where in the world \u2014 or at the fair \u2014 is Sarah Palin?   The most famous noncandidate in the 2012 presidential field is playing cat-and-mouse games again. Ms. Palin, the former Alaska governor, has let it be known that she intends to visit the Iowa State Fair at some point this weekend as part of her \u201cOne Nation\u201d bus tour of historic and important sites around the country. Will it be Friday? Will she show up at the fair\u2019s soap box, where candidates offer speeches to the crowd? Will she drive in on a tractor, much like she appeared at the Rolling Thunder rally on Memorial Day riding a Harley? No one knows, and her aides aren\u2019t talking. They \u2014 and she \u2014 like the mystery and the sense of turning the tables on the media, which she believes has not been fair to her. Wandering through the crowd Friday morning, whispers could be heard among the fairgoers: \u201cCan you see her?\u201d \u201cIs she here yet?\u201d \u201cWhen does she get here?\u201d They might be disappointed, of course. Just like the Palin fans who waited for hours at Gettysburg earlier this summer only to have her mysteriously delay her visit by a day, with no explanation. Iowa fairgoers might be luckier today. If she does arrive, she is likely to make a grand entrance, stirring Twitter into a crazed frenzy all over again. But even if she does arrive, the question lingers: what does it mean? Is Ms. Palin methodically planning for a very late entrance into the race, with the hopes of becoming the Republican nominee? Or is she just using her celebrity and the uncertainty to maintain her popularity so she can write more books and do more TV shows? As with everything else about Sarah Palin, no one really knows but her. In the meantime, we will keep looking for her. There doesn\u2019t seem to be a booth for fried caribou on a stick, but maybe pork is similar enough.",

With the Republican presidential campaign shaken by Herman Cain\u2019s announcement that he was reassessing his bid, a conservative group said Tuesday that it bought airtime in Iowa for a television advertisement urging Ms. Palin to run. The group, Conservatives 4 Palin, which describes itself as \u201can independent grass-roots blog,\u201d said it had bought $6,500 in television ads on the local ABC station in Sioux City. The ad was scheduled to be shown Wednesday during \u201cGood Morning America,\u201d \u201cDr. Oz,\u201d and the evening broadcasts, the group said. In the ad, Ms. Palin is shown giving a speech on \u201ccrony capitalism\u201d alongside footage of President Obama.

She has not endorsed any presidential candidate yet. Some supporters have been raising money on the Conservatives 4 Palin Web site in recent weeks to run the ad in Iowa. If the ad gets people talking about Ms. Palin again, the group said its next step might be paying to conduct a national poll that included Ms. Palin as a candidate.",

      "content": "Within two weeks, you probably won\u2019t be able to escape a glimpse of former Gov. Sarah Palin, as her book tour moves into high gear, complete with a slot on Oprah\u2019s show. And in the last few days, an Iowa group has been particularly intent on trying to snag the former Republican vice presidential nominee as the headliner for an event. Even in the face of probable rejection because of her busy book schedule, the Iowa Family Policy Center decided to try to woo her more heavily, by attempting to pay her $100,000. By the time of this posting, it still doesn\u2019t seem as if Ms. Palin ever would\u2019ve gone to Iowa, or had asked for a fee, or if the offer is still on the table. Politico\u2019s Jonathan Martin wrote today that conservatives were \u201cwincing\u201d at the notion of paying a politician for the privilege of speaking to people in the vaunted first caucus state. Ed Failor, Jr., president of Iowans for Tax Relief, tells Politico: \u201cIf somebody tells me they want me to pay an appearance fee, it tells me they\u2019re not very serious about running for president.\u201d Conservatives4Palin says Politico was attempting \u201cto stir up controversy\u201d with its story. Palin\u2019s detractors, of course, are having a little fun, especially in light of the disclosures earlier this week that she had received a $1.25 million book advance. Matthew Yglesias writes, in a post entitled, \u201cCynicism and Greed Stand in the Way of Sarah Palin\u2019s Political Aspirations:\u201d Holly Bailey at Newsweek\u2019s The Gaggle was in touch with a representative for Ms. Palin, who did not exactly clarify matters. Calling Out Sarah Palin Then there\u2019s this: Conservative bloggers are crying foul at a new effort by the Democratic National Committee to take on Ms. Palin on her own turf: Facebook, from where she has offered endorsements, made announcements and lobbed attacks at the Democrats and even against more moderate members of her own party. Most recently, for example, Ms. Palin endorsed a third-party candidate in New York\u2019s divisive congressional race in the 23rd District on her Facebook page. She is backing Doug Hoffman, the Conservative Party nominee, over Assemblywoman Dede Scozzafava, a Republican who supports same-sex marriage and abortion rights. The D.N.C.\u2019s Web video employs the phrase President Obama uttered during his health care address to Congress, in which he said he and others would \u201ccall out\u201d those spreading falsehoods about health care plans. And one of those fake rumors that went viral this past summer was about the so-called death panels, and Ms. Palin was among those harshly criticizing them as though they would ever have come to fruition. The Democrats\u2019 online effort includes the video entitled \u201cCall Em Out: Sarah Palin, and a place to click so that readers can \u201cshare\u201d an open letter to Ms. Palin via Facebook. At Gateway Pundit, Jim Hoft calls the Democrat\u2019s strategy \u201cpathetic.\u201d At Conservatives4Palin, Joe Report writes that the Democrats must feel threatened by Ms. Palin\u2019s popularity: At The Daily Dish, Andrew Sullivan, who wrote a long post in July about what he called Ms. Palin\u2019s \u201clies,\u201d refers to the D.N.C.\u2019s campaign today and notes \u201c55 percent of Americans still believe she\u2019s honest.\u201d While Ms. Palin herself was not addressing the D.N.C. effort, several of her \u201cfriends\u201d on Facebook were condemning the campaign against her today, while on Twitter, many of her critics were \u201creTweeting\u201d the D.N.C.\u2019s message.",

Sarah Palin kicked off a rally in Ohio this afternoon with a feisty shot at Ms. Fey, who has played Ms. Palin with dead-on accuracy on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d for the last two months. Ms. Palin had just taken the stage after Gretchen Wilson, the country singer, who sang \u201cRedneck Woman\u201d to warm up the crowd. \u201cSpeaking of great performances, did anyone catch John McCain on \u2018SNL\u2019 last night?\u201d Ms. Palin said, drawing cheers. \u201cA little advice to Tina Fey,\u201d Ms. Palin said. \u201cI want to make sure she\u2019s holding on to that Sarah outfit. Because she\u2019s gonna need it in the next four years.\u201d It turns out Ms. Palin missed the full experience of watching Mr. McCain on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d She boarded her charter plane at 11:30 p.m. on Saturday, just on time to watch the show, an aide said, but the audio on her television wasn\u2019t working.",

      "content": "TUCSON \u2014   Senator John McCain and Sarah Palin embraced on stage here on Friday as they made their first joint campaign appearance since their presidential race, with Ms. Palin assuring Republicans in Arizona that Mr. McCain should not be dispatched from office by a conservative challenger. \u201cFor the sake of your state, for the sake of our country, send a maverick back to the United States Senate,\u201d  Ms. Palin told an audience in a rally at the Pima County Fairgrounds. She added, \u201cIt was John McCain who warned us about this administration\u2019s plan for growing government.\u201d As he faces a conservative primary challenge in his bid for a fifth Senate term, Mr. McCain asked for help. Ms. Palin answered the call, and Arizonans arrived by the thousands to see the pair again. Even Cindy McCain, who makes few public appearances these days, was on hand to introduce Ms. Palin. And Todd Palin stood behind, smiling. Ms. Palin urged Republicans to rise up against the new health care law. Days after telling supporters, \u201cDon\u2019t retreat, just reload,\u201d she said she did not advocate violence and warned Republicans not to be diverted by the criticism. \u201cWe know violence isn\u2019t the answer,\u201d Ms. Palin said. \u201cWhen we take up our arms, we do it with our votes.\u201d The rally here on Friday carried an air of nostalgia for the Republican ticket, but instead of criticizing candidate Barack Obama, they criticized his administration. Cars and pickup trucks lined up for miles outside the dusty desert fairgrounds, where people waited for hours to see Ms. Palin, chanting \u201cSarah, Sarah, Sarah.\u201d For Mr. McCain, it was one of his biggest audiences since losing the presidency. \u201cShe energized America and she still does today,\u201d Mr. McCain said. \u201cI\u2019m proud of Sarah Palin and I know you are too.\u201d Ms. Palin, who has campaigned for conservative candidates across the country, has drawn a bit of backlash for stepping into Mr. McCain\u2019s race with J.D. Hayworth, a former Republican congressman from Arizona, who refers to himself as the \u201cconsistent conservative.\u201d She said she wanted to \u201cclear the air\u201d about the criticism, saying that Mr. McCain is as much a candidate of the Tea Party as anyone. \u201cLet\u2019s not beat around the bush,\u201d Ms. Palin said. \u201cEverybody here supporting John McCain, we are all part of that Tea Party movement.\u201d The former Alaska governor is the latest in a parade of prominent Republicans coming to Mr. McCain\u2019s aid here in Arizona. In recent weeks, he has stood side-by-side with Senator Scott Brown of Massachusetts and former Republican presidential rival Mitt Romney. And Jeb Bush has endorsed Mr. McCain\u2019s candidacy from afar. But it\u2019s an open question what effect the endorsements will have. Mr. Hayworth, who has drawn the support of several Tea Party followers and other conservative activists, welcomed Ms. Palin to Arizona but doubted that her seal of approval for Mr. McCain would mean much to voters here. \u201cThe actions of this campaign, lining up all these endorsements by non-Arizonans, typifies a style of campaigning that has been the norm for John for the better part of the last decade,\u201d Mr. Hayworth said. \u201cCertainly his national aspirations have affected his ability to represent Arizona.\u201d",

Both candidates stuck to their stump speeches, and then worked the crowd, Mr. McCain in a dark suit and tie, Ms. Palin in a black suit with ruby red, patent leather heels at least three inches high. Afterward they headed to Dulles Airport and boarded separate campaign planes, parked side by side on the tarmac. Ms. Palin was headed for a homecoming in Alaska, more than 10 hours away. Mr. McCain was headed for an economic forum at the Down Home Diner in Philadelphia, in front of his first post-Palin crowd since the conclusion of the Republican National Convention.",

      "subtitle": "News Outlets Pounce on Palin E-Mails",
      "author": "",
      "content": "News organizations that pored over nearly 25,000 pages of e-mail correspondence relating to Sarah Palin on Friday focused on her selection as Senator John McCain\u2019s running mate in 2008, her relationship with the media and her style of governing. Many news outlets \u2014 what Ms. Palin, the former governor of Alaska, calls the \u201clamestream media\u201d \u2014 sent reporters to Juneau for the release of the e-mails by the state government in response to Freedom of Information Act requests. The result? After a day of frantically poring over the correspondence, with the help of millions of online readers, there were no major revelations but plenty of attempts to dissect the background of a woman who might yet run for president. A review in the morning of Web sites for news organizations and major blogs found that most gave the story prominent play, with large headlines and, in some cases, multiple articles. One exception: Fox News, where Ms. Palin is a paid commentator. The network\u2019s home page offered one link to its article with the headline \u201cPalin E-Mails Reveal Harsh Scrutiny After VP Pick.\u201d It came above an article about a fight on an airliner and below one about Turkish preparations for elections. Many articles focused on the period just before and after Ms. Palin was chosen as the Republican vice-presidential nominee. CNN\u2019s headline said \u201cE-Mails Show GOP Circling Palin in Late 2008.\u201d The Huffington Post wrote about \u201cSarah Palin and John McCain\u2019s Courtship.\u201d The Daily Beast led its site with \u201cBush, Palin Joked about VP Rumors.\u201d The New York Times\u00a0focused on that period as well. The article, headlined \u201cIn E-Mails, a Glimpse From Inside Palin\u2019s Rise,\u201d noted that Ms. Palin seemed genuinely surprised by Mr. McCain\u2019s choosing her. \u201cCan you believe it!\u201d she wrote in response to a staff member\u2019s \u201cWow governor\u201d message that Friday in late August when the choice was announced. \u201cHe told me yesterday \u2014 it moved fast! Pray! I love you.\u201d The Anchorage Daily News, which served as Ms. Palin\u2019s hometown newspaper throughout her time in the governor\u2019s office, focused on the many criticisms of the media sprinkled throughout the e-mails. \u201cE-Mails Show Criticism Put Palin on Defensive,\u201d a headline said. \u201cA massive trove of e-mails released Friday from Sarah Palin\u2019s time as governor show a chief executive who was engrossed with countering her critics and increasingly upset at news coverage as she vaulted into international celebrity,\u201d the paper wrote. Politico focused on what it saw as a crucial difference between Ms. Palin\u2019s political style during her governorship and her approach to politics now. \u201cLong-Lost Sarah Palin Surfaces in E-Mails,\u201d the headline said. \u201cOnce, there was a different Sarah Palin,\u201d Politico wrote in its article. \u201cShe was hands-on and averse to partisan politics. She championed openness in government and had normal relations with the media. She was a little starstruck by her interactions with national politicians but unafraid to do battle with the chief executives of the world\u2019s largest oil companies.\u201d The Washington Post picked up that theme as well, saying that the e-mails offered\u201cvivid new color and fresh details to the complicated public portrait of Sarah Palin, who displayed many of the same strengths, and shortcomings, as Alaska governor that she would later bring to the national political stage.\u201d Some news organizations had fun with the e-mail release. The Guardian in Britain used one word \u2014 \u201cUnflippinbelievable\u201d \u2014 as their headline, a reference to the fact that Ms. Palin used that phrase several times in e-mails during her time as governor. Drudge Report offered several links, most focused on the media\u2019s handling of the document release. \u201cPRESS HUNTS MAMA GRIZZLY\u2026\u201d\u00a0 one headline said. Another said, \u201cDEAD TREES: 30+ reporters scour 275 lbs. of paper, 24,000 e-mails\u2026\u201d And then there was this one, from The Detroit News, which apparently decided to go for the local angle. \u201cSearch Shows Few Michigan References in Palin E-Mails,\u201d the paper\u2019s headline said. \u201cConcerns over pipeline safety and a job hire recommendation were the only two Michigan connections in thousands of Sarah Palin e-mails released today.\u201d",

The ad is decidedly low-tech and has run on some of Iowa\u2019s smaller broadcast stations like WOI in Des Moines, a sign that the group is not putting much money behind its campaign. But what the commercial lacks in sophistication it makes up for in audacity. \u201cCrony capitalism and corruption in government is eating this country alive,\u201d says the message on screen, which is displayed in simple white font against a black backdrop as a montage of still photos of Ms. Palin flash by. \u201cThis disease must be addressed by our next president or the crooks will still be running your candy store.\u201d The ad ends with Ms. Palin\u2019s voice, taken from a political rally, saying, \u201cGod bless you, Iowa!\u201d and it implores viewers, \u201cPlease, caucus for Sarah Palin.\u201d The group that placed the ad has been calling local television stations to inquire about their rates in recent days, explaining itself  as an organization that is pushing Ms. Palin through Facebook. A Facebook page called \u201cSarah Palin\u2019s Earthquake Movement\u201d urges fans to donate money through a PayPal account. \u201cThe cost of one 10 pm news show slot is $500.00 just to give you an idea of how fast the funds can go,\u201d it says. \u201cPrimetime shows are anywhere from $1500.00 to $3500.00. If you can, please donate.\u201d So far the page has nearly 1,300 \u201cLikes.\u201d The group has also created a similar radio ad urging Iowans to \u201cvote rogue\u201d and caucus for the former Alaska governor.",

      "content": "LOUISVILLE \u2014 A senior adviser to Gov. Sarah Palin delivered a late-night tongue-lashing to the news media on Wednesday, protesting ABC News\u2019s characterization of an interview with Ms. Palin as evidence of her 2012 presidential aspirations. The interview was promoted on ABCNews.com on Wednesday afternoon with selected excerpts and the headline, \u201cSarah Palin Vows to Remain Player in 2012: \u2018Not Doing This For Naught.\u2019 \u201d After the full transcript was released, revealing that the headline was misleading, ABC later amended its release to read, \u201cSarah Palin: \u2018Not Doing This For Naught.\u2019 \u201d But it was too late for the cable news networks, which quickly seized on the report, as did wire services and some newspapers, all of whom repeated the error. Tucker Eskew, the adviser to Ms. Palin, spoke to reporters aboard the campaign plane after Ms. Palin had left a campaign rally in Indiana that drew 16,000 people. After explaining ABC News\u2019s mistake, which he called \u201ca terrifically misleading headline,\u201d and acknowledging that the network had apologized, Mr. Eskew offered his own critique. \u201cThat mistake was then compounded,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it was compounded by some of the other coverage, and if you will bear with me, I\u2019ll get to that in a minute.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s just, I think, beyond the pale. I think it\u2019s a time for us, as this campaign builds an occasionally acknowledged but real momentum toward a very fast-approaching deadline of Election Day, that this record get corrected. Get corrected very directly, and that some standards of fairness and accuracy be met.\u201d When Ms. Palin learned how the interview had been characterized, she wanted to make sure it had been corrected, Mr. Eskew said. \u201cShe felt there was an error,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was curious about how it was getting fixed. And then she turned back to what she was doing, six or seven other things at once. She\u2019s fine.\u201d He compared the media treatment of Ms. Palin to that of Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton, who have had notoriously rocky relations with the press. \u201cThe list of those distortions and attacks go beyond any witnessed by, even, I think, the most immediate member of the Clinton family. It is overwhelming to observers, but not to Sarah Palin. You\u2019ll find her knocked around and unbowed.\u201d Asked what Ms. Palin\u2019s plans for 2012 are, Mr. Eskew said only, \u201cTo help John McCain and his re-election.\u201d",

      "content": "With 13 days until the Iowa caucuses, Donald J. Trump and Ted Cruz, the senator from Texas, are deploying different surrogates but similar playbooks in the state, where the Republican electorate is conservative and where each is trying hard to win. Mr. Trump\u2019s closing argument began on Tuesday night with the endorsement of Sarah Palin, the Republican vice-presidential nominee in 2008, who built a grass-roots following from the ashes of defeat that year. Mrs. Palin could be a significant help to Mr. Trump, certainly in terms of news media attention. But much of the coverage of her endorsement speech was negative. Pundits and reporters took note of her rambling, edgy-seeming, sometimes-rhyming presentation in Iowa, with Mr. Trump standing nearby, occasionally looking as if he wished it would wrap up. That may not matter much, since Mrs. Palin\u2019s supporters are mistrustful of the \u201clamestream media,\u201d as she has described the press in recent years. And Mr. Cruz\u2019s team was mindful enough of the potential impact of her endorsement that he clarified a negative comment from his spokesman about her support for Mr. Trump. But some Republicans see an upside for Mr. Cruz in the performance of Mrs. Palin, who, like Mr. Trump, has reality television star as a line on her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and who has been absent from the national scene for many months. Those Republicans argue that Mrs. Palin and Mr. Trump could make Mr. Cruz look more presidential. But 2016 has been an unusual, and unpredictable, cycle. Mr. Cruz has criticized government subsidies of the renewable fuels industry in Iowa, but, instead of being praised by small-government conservatives, he was denounced by Gov. Terry E. Branstad, Iowa\u2019s Republican governor, and few others came to Mr. Cruz\u2019s defense. And Mrs. Palin\u2019s support was seen as a boon for Mr. Trump, despite Republicans\u2019 frustration with what they see as a \u201ccelebrity\u201d president in Barack Obama. Her endorsement has also raised expectations for Mr. Trump in Iowa. It is a state that he can afford to lose, but it becomes harder to explain away a loss if he campaigns hard there. However, Mr. Trump is not used to losing, and he does not seem interested in starting now.",

      "content": "Updated, 2:09 p.m. | As rumors swirled Tuesday that Sarah Palin, the 2008 Republican vice-presidential nominee, would endorse Donald J. Trump in Iowa, the former Alaska governor posted on Twitter a link to a comment from her daughter Bristol slamming Senator Ted Cruz, who holds a slim lead over Mr. Trump in the polls there.  \u201cIs THIS why people don\u2019t like Cruz?\u201d Sarah Palin asked in her Twitter message, with a link to a blog post by her daughter under that headline.  Bristol Palin, in the blog item, teased the speculation about her mother\u2019s intentions. \u201cIs my mom going to endorse Donald Trump for president of the United States?\u201d Bristol Palin wrote. \u201cThat\u2019s the rumor, and I\u2019ve been too busy with diapers to delve too much into politics these days. But the rumors were enough to cause staffers from Ted Cruz\u2019s office to slam my mom.\u201d She pointed to an assertion by Rick Tyler, Mr. Cruz\u2019s spokesman, on CNN, that supporting Mr. Trump would align Sarah Palin, \u201ca champion for the conservative cause,\u201d with \u201csomeone who\u2019s held progressive views all their life on the sanctity of life, on marriage, on partial-birth abortion.\u201d Bristol Palin said that she didn\u2019t know whether the endorsement would happen, but that what Mr. Cruz\u2019s camp was now saying about her mother \u201cmakes me hope my mom does endorse Trump.\u201d Mr. Trump has a rally set for 6 p.m. Eastern time in Ames, Iowa, which is being billed as a \u201cmajor announcement\u201d with a \u201cspecial guest.\u201d Despite her waning pull within the Republican Party, Sarah Palin is still a Tea Party favorite and would provide Mr. Trump with valuable currency at a moment when Mr. Cruz is attacking him over his conservative bona fides. Ms. Palin also remains a magnet of controversy and intrigue that could help Mr. Trump maximize his attention ahead of the Feb. 1 caucuses. In an effort to maintain the suspense, Mr. Trump earlier Tuesday would not reveal who would be accompanying him. \u201cI\u2019m a big fan of Sarah Palin, but I\u2019m not saying who it is,\u201d he said. \u201cI think everyone will be very impressed.\u201d But the Cruz campaign appeared prepared either way.

      "author": "By Alan Rappeport",
      "content": "Sarah Palin made her return to national politics this week with a rousing endorsement of Donald Trump, praising the billionaire developer for his penchant for \u201cgoing rogue\u201d and lashing out at Republicans who say he is not sufficiently conservative. While Mrs. Palin\u2019s influence within the party has waned since 2008, when she was a vice-presidential candidate, the Trump campaign views her as someone who can bolster the candidate\u2019s support with evangelical Christians and Tea Party Republicans in Iowa. Her ability to turn out voters remains to be seen, but stumping with Mr. Trump appears to be doing some damage to Mrs. Palin among her own supporters, especially on social media. The former Alaska governor maintains a community of millions of Facebook fans, and while some cheered her backing of Mr. Trump, others called her a sellout who was only seeking another moment in the political spotlight. \u201cVery sorry to see that Sarah Palin has decided that being a maverick is more important than being a conservative,\u201d said Dale Roberts, of Calvert City, Ky. \u201cTrump supports gay marriage. He is pro abortion. He is anything but a conservative.\u201d John Guy Lockwood Burpee, of Fort Worth, said that he was disappointed that Mrs. Palin would be critical of one of his senators from Texas, Ted Cruz, who is locked in a tight race with Mr. Trump less than two weeks before the Iowa caucuses. \u201cI know you are upset with the establishment, and rightfully so, but going after Ted Cruz is not you,\u201d he said. \u201cSo disappointing and heartbreaking to see this.\u201d Although Mr. Trump has won the support of many evangelical Christians, he has struggled at times to discuss religion with fluency and he has strained to explain his previous liberal positions on abortion and same-sex marriage. This week he was mocked when he referred to the Bible verse Second Corinthians as \u201cTwo Corinthians\u201d during a speech at Liberty University. Fans of Mrs. Palin could not understand how she could endorse someone who says that he does not ask for God\u2019s forgiveness and who does not appear to read the Bible. \u201cSarah, I have lost all respect for you,\u201d said Barbara Fitzgerald, of Grand Rapids, Mich. \u201cTrump is anything but a conservative and he clearly lacks humility and fear of the Lord. What a shameful act on your part.\u201d Ryan Dyal, of Jacksonville, Fla., was also disappointed in Mrs. Palin. But he\u00a0remained hopeful that she could teach Mr. Trump something about Christianity while they campaign together. \u201cHe does not share your values,\u201d Mr. Dyal said of Mr. Trump. \u201cI hope there is prayer and wisdom in this that I cannot see. Praying for you Sarah. Make sure he understands the full Gospel, will ya?\u201d",

      "content": "Sarah Palin in 2016? Even she thinks that\u2019s a joke. The former vice-presidential candidate made her final transition to pure celebrity and political punch line on Sunday night, when Lorne Michaels\u2019s \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d celebrated its 40th birthday with a comic extravaganza that became NBC Entertainment\u2019s top-rated show in more than a decade. \u201cI\u2019m just curious, Jerry, how much do you think Lorne Michaels would pay me if I were to run in 2016?\u201d Ms. Palin asked, standing up in the audience to joke with Jerry Seinfeld, who was onstage in the legendary Studio 8H. She then threw in a hypothetical about another Republican headliner with big hair sitting a few rows back. \u201cWhat if I were to choose Donald Trump as my running mate?\u201d Looking less hockey mom than Hollywood vamp, Ms. Palin wore a short, sparkly white dress with arm cut-outs and black bondage heels. Even though John McCain\u2019s 2008 strategists still fume about her shopping sprees on the trail, Ms. Palin told US Weekly \u2013 after Twitter monitors called her out \u2013 that she borrowed her dress, red-soled shoes and fur purse from her daughter Bristol\u2019s closet. The dress was so slinky it nearly caused a wardrobe malfunction. Ms. Palin had to wear the battery pack underneath the sheath on her back with her microphone hooked to the top. The NBC technician who came to take off the battery and mic during the commercial break had a hard time reaching them, so the unfazed Ms. Palin stood in the aisle, yanking up and down her mini as she tried to slither out of the equipment. Ms. Palin, joshing about her \u201916 prospects in the studio where she once lampooned herself as \u201cCaribou Barbie,\u201d walked onstage past her doppelganger Tina Fey and did a rap skit with a very pregnant Amy Poehler,  was only one of the surreal moments Sunday night. Yet the anniversary show, which the serene Mr. Michaels admitted was \u201ca nightmare\u201d to produce, went off without a hitch \u2013 against all odds and egos. Not only did Mr. Michaels get Keith Richards to introduce Paul McCartney for a song during the show, but at the glamorous Champagne-and-sliders after-party at the Plaza Hotel, where Ms. Palin held court in one corner and Ms. Fey and Ms. Poehler mingled elsewhere, Taylor Swift popped up to do backup for Mr. McCartney singing \u201cI Saw Her Standing There.\u201d And because he\u2019s a player, not a hater, Sir Paul plucked his bass and did backup for Ms. Swift on \u201cShake It Off.\u201d As the \u201cFoxcatcher\u201d director Bennett Miller noted, it was a night that captured cascading generations of magic (and misses) in comedy and music. \u201cCan you imagine the world,\u201d he mused, looking down at the stage full of \u201cS.N.L.\u201d veterans, \u201cif none of the people in this room had ever existed?\u201d",

Chinese officials said the quake struck in a poor and sparsely populated area near the mountainous border with Tibet. The circumstances echo the devastating earthquake that rocked neighboring Sichuan Province almost two years ago, killing 87,000 people. [The New York Times] Palin Saga at Cal State  | California\u2019s attorney general, Jerry Brown, said Tuesday that he would look closer into the foundation at California State University, Stanislaus, that invited Sarah Palin to speak. This comes after allegations surfaced that the foundation tried to destroy documents related to Ms. Palin\u2019s scheduled campus appearance in June. Students at Stanislaus said they recovered shredded documents outside an administration building late last week, a month after State Senator Leland Yee of San Francisco began pushing for the documents surrounding Ms. Palin\u2019s visit to be handed over.  Mr. Brown said the issue was not Sarah Palin, but rather \u201cpublic disclosure and financial accountability in organizations embedded in state-run universities.\u201d [The Los Angeles Times] Crime Lab Laughed at Discrepancies | Deborah Madden, the former technician at the center of the drug-handling scandal at San Francisco Police Department\u2019s crime lab, described to investigators in February a culture at the lab where technicians routinely \u201claughed at\u201d discrepancies in narcotics weights. Ms. Madden, a 29-year civilian employee, was never charged with skimming drugs, although she admitted to taking \u201cspilled remnants\u201d of cocaine back to her home in vials five times in late 2009. The police said they later found 21 empty vials at her home and evidence at the lab that 11 packages of cocaine were stapled and re-opened. [The San Francisco Chronicle] Father Sues Caltrain | A Washington State man has filed claims against Caltrain, SamTrans, Redwood City, San Mateo County and a train engineer in connection with his son\u2019s death last year in Redwood City. The son, Charles Isaacson, 64, was crossing the tracks in a car when traffic in front of him stopped to yield to a fire truck. Moments later, a train traveling more than 60 miles an hour collided into Mr. Isaacson\u2019s Honda. The legal claim by the father, Donald Isaacson, includes the municipal and county governments because they might have designed or operated the roads near the tracks. [The San Jose Mercury News] Death Penalty a Lightning Rod | A Sonoma County judicial race has \u201cexploded into controversy,\u201d The Santa Rosa Press Democrat reports, after Chris Mazzia, a candidate, accused his rival Jamie Thistlethwaite of promising local Democratic leaders that she would try never to issue the death penalty if they offered her the party endorsement. Ms. Thistlethwaite, a criminal defense lawyer, has denied trying to strike an agreement with the party and has accused Mr. Mazzia of political mudslinging. [The Santa Rosa Press Democrat] Deal Ends De Young Art Dispute, Somewhat | A mindboggling legal tug of war surrounding dozens of pieces of tribal Oceanic art at the M.H. de Young Museum \u2014 the world\u2019s most significant collection of its kind \u2014 has drawn to a close. The City of San Francisco, which owns the museum, will  retain 274 of the original collection\u2019s 398 pieces. Of the rest, 29 will be sold off, and the remainder will be held as collateral by Sotheby\u2019s, although they remain on show. The auction house is trying to collect on a $25 million loan it extended to the New York philanthropists John and Marcia Friede years ago when they amassed the collection. [The San Francisco Chronicle] Benecia Bike Race Called Off | The promoters of the bike race in downtown Benecia have called off the event just days after the city approved the event. The city issued a permit for June 13 after stipulating that the event planners control pedestrian crossings and install signs guiding detoured drivers. Promoters on Tuesday said they did not have enough time to meet the conditions. [The Vallejo Times Herald]",

      "content": "Update | 11:35 p.m. The McCain campaign dissed Sarah Palin, muffled her, and then stuck her with a $50,000 legal bill \u2014 that, at least, is the version of events she tells in her new book, due to be released next week. Ms. Palin writes that the bill was for vetting her to be John McCain\u2019s vice presidential nominee, according to the Associated Press, which purchased an early copy of the book. After the election, when she asked if the campaign would help her financially, Ms. Palin says aides told her it would have been covered if the ticket won. Since they lost, it was her responsibility. An official with the McCain campaign with knowledge of the matter referred questions to Mr. McCain\u2019s general counsel, Trevor Potter, but, the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, added that Ms. Palin\u2019s claim about being stuck with a $50,000 legal bill for the vetting process was \u201ccompletely false, not true.\u201d Mr. Potter did not immediately respond to a phone message Thursday night. But he told the Associated Press that the campaign had never asked Palin to pay a legal bill. \u201cTo my knowledge, the campaign never billed Gov. Palin for any legal expenses related to her vetting and I am not aware of her ever asking the campaign to pay legal expenses that her own lawyers incurred for the vetting process,\u201d he said. Publishing sources said Ms. Palin received a $5 million advance for the book, which she wrote with a co-author, Lynn Vincent. A high price, perhaps, to confirm what is hardly a well-kept secret anymore: these folks did not get along. According to the A.P., Ms. Palin backs up other media accounts of how she was blocked when she wanted to give a concession speech on election night (Mr. McCain and his aides believed this would be unprecedented, and a generally bad idea, given her tendency for, as  the book\u2019s title puts it, \u201cGoing Rogue.\u201d) She says the campaign refused to let her rewrite the statement announcing her teenage daughter\u2019s pregnancy, instead issuing remarks that Ms. Palin thought glamorized the pregnancy. And contrary to earlier reports that the Palin family saw the campaign as a free ticket to a new wardrobe, Ms. Palin writes that she was awed by the stylist and the clothes the campaign provided, The A.P. reports. When she asked who was paying, she writes, McCain aides told her it was \u201cpart of the convention.\u201d The A.P. says that in the book, Ms. Palin also accuses the McCain campaign of keeping her away from reporters, which fed a perception that she was ignoring the media. She writes that she sat down with Katie Couric in part because she felt sorry for her, after Nicolle Wallace, a McCain aide, said Ms. Couric suffered from low self-esteem. But in the interview, Ms. Palin writes, Ms. Couric was biased and badgering. (Ms. Palin got terrible reviews for the interviews.) The 432-page book, published by HarperCollins, is currently the No. 1 pre-order item on Borders.com, and has been steadily within the top ten on Amazon. Despite her disdain for the media, Ms. Palin spent part of Thursday on the first part of a media blitz for the book, taping an interview to air Monday on the Oprah Winfrey show. On her Web site, Ms. Winfrey said they talked about everything: the campaign, the marriage, her children, including the pregnancy of her eldest daughter, and her estranged would-have-been son-in-law, Levi Johnston, who has been doing his own media tour attempting to take down Ms. Palin\u2019s devoted hockey mom image. Her book tour will take her to smaller cities across the country, but this week, she is in New York, taping appearances on several television shows, including an interview with Barbara Walters that is to air in several parts over the next week on ABC. This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: \n\nCorrection, November 14, 2009\n\nA report in The Caucus column on Friday about Sarah Palin\u2019s new book, \u201cGoing Rogue,\u201d using information from The Associated Press, gave an incorrect amount in some copies for the legal costs she said the McCain campaign made her pay for its vetting of her as a vice presidential candidate. According to her account in the book, it was $50,000, not $500,000.",

      "content": "Making her debut as a Fox News analyst Tuesday night, Sarah Palin immediately picked up the network\u2019s mantra, promising that she would provide \u201cfair and balanced commentary.\u201d That seemed to mean largely agreeing with her host, Bill O\u2019Reilly \u2013-  that President Obama\u2019s decline in polls is not a surprise, that Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi are out of touch. (\u201cDo you think that she\u2019s a kook?\u201d Mr. O\u2019Reilly asked about the latter.) But for the most part, what Ms. Palin punditized about was Ms. Palin, and the perception, as Mr. O\u2019Reilly put it, \u201cthat you\u2019re not that smart.\u201d Why all the criticism of her? asked Mr. O\u2019Reilly. \u201cIt\u2019s not about me personally,\u201d Ms. Palin said. \u201cThey don\u2019t like the message, they don\u2019t like the common sense conservative solutions I articulate.\u201d After marveling that \u201c60 Minutes\u201d spent 8 minutes on Ms. Palin Sunday night, Mr. O\u2019Reilly spent about 20 with her (followed by a 5-minute analysis of the new analyst.) Ms. Palin used the new forum to rebut revelations from a new book about the 2008 campaign, that, for instance, she did not know the difference between North and South Korea, and that she believed that Saddam Hussein had attacked the United States on 9/11. Mr. O\u2019Reilly told her that Fox would be her place for rebuttal. \u201cAnytime you want to set the record straight, we\u2019re here,\u201d he said. \u201cOh,\u201d Ms. Palin replied, \u201cwe\u2019ll be doing a lot of that.\u201d",

      "content": " ON THE NEWT GINGRICH PRESS BUS, Interstate 20, S.C. \u2014 Sarah Palin, who conducted a lengthy flirtation with a run for the Republican nomination last year, ended the equally lengthy speculation over which candidate she would endorse by naming Newt Gingrich \u2014 sort of.   Ms. Palin said that in her view, Mr. Gingrich won Monday\u2019s debate in Myrtle Beach, S.C.  She hedged her praise somewhat by suggesting she was going with Mr. Gingrich to prolong the Republican contest \u2014 in other words, to head off the inevitability of Mitt Romney\u2019s coronation should he win handily in South Carolina. She said that a longer race meant more debates and more vetting of candidates, something that did not occur as it should have, in her view, with President Obama. \u201cI want to see this thing continue because iron sharpens iron, steel sharpens steel,\u2019\u2019 Ms. Palin said, framed against a rugged Alaska backdrop where such metaphors presumably come naturally. \u201cThese guys are getting better in their debates, they\u2019re getting more concise, they\u2019re getting more grounded in what their beliefs are and articulating what their ideas are to get the country back on the right track and get Americans working again.\u2019\u2019 Ms. Palin elicits strong feelings both positive and negative, but her endorsement is coveted even by strategists who dismiss the influence of endorsements in general.",

      "subtitle": "Sarah Palin\u2019s Nomination Chances: A Reassessment",
      "author": "By Nate Silver",
      "content": "In November 2009, I wrote an article entitled \u201c10 Reasons That Sarah Palin Could Win the Republican Nomination.\u201d The article wasn\u2019t necessarily arguing that she was the favorite to take the nomination, but it did suggest she had a credible chance at it. In light of the developments of the last 13 months, it is probably worthwhile to revisit that assessment. Do these reasons still hold? Assuming that she runs, are her chances at becoming the Republican nominee stronger or weaker than they were a year ago? Let\u2019s examine each of my original arguments in some detail. Enthusiasm is difficult to discern in surveys: pollsters generally have more trouble anticipating who exactly is going to vote than which candidate they might vote for, especially in primaries where participation rates are relatively low. So, if Ms. Palin\u2019s numbers are problematic in some polls \u2014 like in a recent CNN survey in which about half of Republicans say they\u2019re unlikely to vote for her \u2014 this is not necessarily a crisis for her if the half of Republicans who are excited about Sarah Palin is also the half that is more likely to vote. What\u2019s a bit unusual for Ms. Palin, however, is that her support tends to be concentrated among Republicans with lower incomes and lower educational attainment \u2014 and these types of people are traditionally less likely to turn out in primaries. On the one hand, this could lead to underestimating support for Ms. Palin once pollsters start applying \u201clikely voter\u201d models. There may be a sizable contingent of Republicans who find Ms. Palin to be a unique candidate and are especially motivated to vote for her, but who are screened out in such surveys because they did not participate in the Republican primaries in previous years. On the other hand, she may need to actuate that support with get-out-the-vote efforts. It could be a mistake for her to rely too heavily on new technology to motivate voter turnout, because the downscale voters who might be most inclined to support her are generally less voracious consumers of information technology than are their wealthier, college-educated cousins. One trap that I can easily imagine Ms. Palin falling into is going too far in eschewing traditional campaign infrastructure, such as field offices. Here is a potential wrench in the works for Ms. Palin. Nov. 2 was, indeed, an extraordinarily successful night for Republicans. But \u2014 at least in terms of how the night was scored by the press \u2014 that victory was mitigated to some extent by the losses of certain Tea Party candidates in high-profile races: particularly Christine O\u2019Donnell, Sharron Angle and Joe Miller, and to a lesser extent, Ken Buck. Ms. Palin endorsed three of the four candidates, the exception being Mr. Buck. That isn\u2019t such a big problem, though; she also picked a lot of winners. The problem, rather, is that it brought the issue of electability to the fore, something that does not play well for Ms. Palin \u2014 she trails Barack Obama by double digits in head-to-head polls, whereas other Republican frontrunners like Mitt Romney are nearly tied with him. Did these Tea Party candidates lose because they were too conservative? Because they were too inexperienced? Because they were simply poor, unlikable candidates? Probably a little of each. Plenty of other Tea Party candidates, like Marco Rubio of Florida and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, did quite well, so we should be wary of oversimple explanations. Nevertheless, the public was willing to differentiate these candidates from others despite the magnitude of the Republican wave, and Republicans may be more reluctant to take such gambles in the future, when the political terrain is unlikely to be quite so favorable. This is no less true than when I wrote it originally. Mr. Romney, if anything, might have a new problem now, given the central role that the Democrats\u2019 health care bill is likely to play in the Republican primaries and that Massachusetts passed a highly similar bill when he was governor there. There have been a few Republicans, like Chris Christie and Paul Ryan, who have seen their stocks rise over the last year, but neither are yet household names (although Mr. Christie is getting there) and both have denied interest in the presidential derby. Ms. Palin is up against some fairly weak competition, and that surely helps her chances. There was a time not too long ago, back when President Obama\u2019s standing was a little stronger, when you\u2019d hear the argument that some of the Republican candidates might sit 2012 out, figuring that 2016 would present a clearer path toward victory. You don\u2019t really hear that anymore. Mr. Obama will not be easy to defeat: his approval ratings have stopped their slide. But clearly, he is beatable. If his approval ratings are in November 2012 what they are right now \u2014 somewhere in the mid-to-high 40s \u2014 a reasonably strong Republican nominee would be about even-money to beat him, based on historical precedent. Figure that you\u2019re a Republican candidate like Mr. Romney or Mr. Huckabee. If you run in 2012, there\u2019s perhaps a 50 percent chance that you\u2019ll defeat Mr. Obama and become president, provided that you win your party\u2019s nomination. If you wait until 2016 instead, there\u2019s a 50 percent chance that you can\u2019t really run at all since another Republican will already have become president. The remaining 50 percent of the time, you\u2019ll nevertheless lose sometimes to whomever the Democrats nominate; they might nominate Hillary Clinton, who would be a formidable opponent. So, perhaps there\u2019s a 50 percent chance that the Republican nomination is open in 2016 (because a Republican hadn\u2019t already become president in 2012); of that 50 percent, you\u2019ll win the election 55 percent of the time (historically, a party has been at a slight disadvantage after having won two consecutive terms, as the Democrats would have in this scenario, so the Republican candidate would probably be a very modest favorite). That works out to a 27.5 percent chance to become president in 2016 (contingent on having won the nomination), worse than the 50 percent chance you\u2019d have in 2012. Some of this is a little silly, by the way. It\u2019s still too early to have more than the vaguest notion of how strong Mr. Obama\u2019s position will ultimately be by November 2012. George H.W. Bush had approval ratings in the high 60s at a comparable point in 1990 and was considered almost certain to win re-election, which deterred many Democrats from entering the race. Fortunately for Democrats, Mr. Bush\u2019s approval rating was barely half that by the time the election was held, and they found a diamond in the rough in Bill Clinton. Still, I\u2019d expect the Republican field to be fairly crowded. Mr. Obama\u2019s position is decent, but it is certainly not strong enough to intimidate any candidates who would otherwise be interested in running for the presidency. Candidates might decline to run for other reasons, of course; Ms. Palin would probably stand the most to gain if Mike Huckabee and Newt Gingrich were not to run, as she is probably in the most direct competition with them for voters. The press has a complicated relationship with Ms. Palin \u2014 and vice versa \u2014 but it could be helpful to her in the following way: if there are moments when her campaign is struggling (and even winning campaigns inevitably have a few of those), she won\u2019t need to worry about a lack of attention of the sort that causes some campaigns to die with a whimper rather than a bang. She\u2019ll be a constant source of intrigue, and if the media is harsh and unfair to her at some points in time, it may also be looking to write her comeback story at others. Since the campaign hasn\u2019t really begun, we haven\u2019t yet had a good test of this theory yet. But, it rests to some extent on the notion that Ms. Palin would adopt a somewhat counter-attacking posture, rather than instigating fights. We\u2019ll address this in a little more depth under point No. 8. This argument was, frankly, a bit hyperbolic at the time that I made it. There aren\u2019t a lot of moderates in the Republican base, and their numbers are declining somewhat. But there are some: 27 percent of Republicans identify as either moderate or liberal. And the number might be somewhat higher than that in a Republican primary since independents can vote in many states as well. Based on exit polls, the fraction of Republican primary voters identifying themselves as moderate or liberal was about one-third in the Republican primaries of 2008, although it varied significantly from state to state: just 12 percent in the Iowa caucus, for instance, but 45 percent in the New Hampshire primary. Certainly, a Republican could win her party\u2019s nomination despite having almost no support among moderates, but it makes her path somewhat tougher. The Republican establishment has indeed begun to critique Ms. Palin quite explicitly. It is very important for Ms. Palin to address this criticism. No, not all Republicans care about what the panelists on Morning Joe, or the Wall Street Journal\u2018s editorial board, think, but enough value that their opinion might make the difference at the margin. Also \u2014 although I\u2019m agnostic on the question as to how much \u201celite\u201d opinion ultimately matters (it matters less than elites think it does, surely!) \u2014 it can sometimes be contagious, shaping the way that some broader spectrum of the public perceives a candidate. Ms. Palin\u2019s response so far \u2014 for instance, characterizing George H.W. Bush and Barbara Bush as \u201cblue bloods\u201d \u2014 has perhaps been somewhat lackluster. This is not necessarily an easy thing to deal with, mind you: people whom you considered to be allies starting to attack you. But one thing that I suspect hurts Ms. Palin is that she herself initiates a lot of conflicts, and may lack discrimination in selecting her targets. Ms. Palin, for instance, recently picked a fight with Michelle Obama over her anti-obesity campaign. This seems an ill-considered choice: the president\u2019s wife is quite popular, and so, I\u2019m sure, are her efforts to combat childhood obesity. Sometimes in interviews, or in presidential debates, a candidate is asked what qualities she admires in her opponent, or in which areas she thinks he has performed well. The goal is generally to mention something so manifestly uncontroversial that you are essentially damning your opponent with faint praise. I can quite easily imagine a Republican candidate, faced with such a question, citing Mr. Obama\u2019s attractive family, and heralding the steps that Ms. Obama has taken to combat obesity. Instead, Ms. Palin has chosen to engage Ms. Obama on this subject. What does this have to do with how Ms. Palin responds to the criticisms from the Republican establishment? A politician has only so many arrows in her quiver. If everything that she says or does seems to convey the sense of being locked into an existential battle against the rest of the world, the public may eventually become fatigued, less able to differentiate the important fights from the unimportant ones, and less likely to see the politician as a victim rather than an aggressor. If there were one piece of advice I would provide to Ms. Palin, it would be the following: pick your battles. You need to placate the concern that you couldn\u2019t win a general election against Mr. Obama, because that is what this critique from the Republican establishment is ultimately all about. Save your efforts for that argument, as well as for the times that your opponents pick a fight with you, which will happen plenty often. This reads, in retrospect, like a relatively trivial point. In a case like Mr. Goldwater\u2019s in 1964, or Mr. McGovern\u2019s in 1972, the incumbent president seemed as though he would be very difficult to defeat, and that may have contributed to the opposition party placing less of a premium on electability and more on ideological purity. Republicans, certainly, are going to have those arguments over the next two years \u2014 but they will come against the backdrop of an election that will seem winnable than 1964 or 1972 did. There is no doubt that Ms. Palin \u201cgets\u201d new media. As she pointed out on her reality show, her use of the invented word \u201crefudiate\u201d became one of the top Google search topics within a matter of hours after her having introduced it in a 140-character Twitter post. Ms. Palin can, at virtually at a moment\u2019s notice, cause the media to drop whatever other stories it is covering and upend the news cycle for a day. This is a unique and powerful ability. But how about the other way around: what does new media think about Ms. Palin? Let\u2019s make this less abstract: what is the prevailing sentiment about her in the conservative blogosphere? Actually, I don\u2019t know that there is any one prevailing sentiment. Republican-leaning blogs have matured significantly since 2008 and there are a lot of flavors of them: more conservative or more moderate, more professional or more amateur, more activist or more analytical. Ms. Palin will surely receive enthusiastic support on some of these blogs. For instance, she won an informal straw poll earlier this month at the influential site Redstate.com, getting the support of 31 percent of participants, as compared to 15 percent for the second-place candidate, the radio host Herman Cain. I would anticipate that other sites, however, might be less enthusiastic about her. Just as the liberal/progressive blogosphere divided itself between pro-Hillary Clinton websites and pro-Barack Obama ones in 2008 \u2014 even though the candidates had few substantive differences, fewer than the major Republican candidates probably will \u2014 I would expect something along the same lines to occur in the conservative blogosphere between now and 2012, with some sites being pro-Palin, some sites opposing her nomination, and many others splitting the difference. I don\u2019t necessarily know that she can be thought of as having some intrinsic advantage in this area. *-* On balance, these factors look somewhat less favorable to Ms. Palin than they did a year ago. In particular, it should be alarming to her how quickly some figures in the Republican establishment have turned against her. It is probably not a coincidence that these attacks began to escalate shortly after this November\u2019s elections, in which Republicans were perceived as having sacrificed several Senate seats, like in Delaware and Nevada, because of having nominated unelectable candidates. Meanwhile \u2014 after an interim period in which she seemed to be playing the role of the happy warrior, endorsing and raising money for Republican candidates \u2014 Ms. Palin recently seems to have become less selective about the arguments that she is engaging in. Her choice to attack Ms. Obama\u2019s anti-obesity initiatives, for instance, suggests that she is either not listening to advice or that her advisers are not highly competent. Instead, she should be erring on the side of turning the other cheek: one thing that has generally been true is that presidential candidates who project a sunnier, more optimistic disposition tend to outlast those that come across as angrier. This may be especially important for Ms. Palin, who is always a lightning-rod for criticism; she doesn\u2019t need to instigate any conflicts that she isn\u2019t already engaged in. Still, Ms. Palin has some unique strengths, like her ability to use new media to attract the political world\u2019s attention virtually at her whim. It remains conceivable, also, that the attacks that Ms. Palin will receive from members of the Republican establishment \u2014 and those which she will eventually begin to receive from other Republican presidential contenders \u2014 could be turned to her advantage if she manages them in the right way, considering the anti-establishment mood in some corners of the party. In the near term, I would look toward two things. First, what is being said about Ms. Palin on conservative blogs, on conservative talk radio, and on Fox News? These reflect the middle ground between elite and popular opinion and may provide a leading indicator \u2014 perhaps more so than polls \u2014 about how much the elite\u2019s criticisms of Ms. Palin, and their concerns about her electability, are penetrating into the general public. Second, I would look toward whom Ms. Palin is hiring as her support staff. A presidential campaign is a huge endeavor, comparable to a medium-sized business. Perhaps, because of her facility in commanding attention, Ms. Palin requires less assistance than a typical candidate might. Perhaps, because she sometimes seems to have an impatience for details and has not run for president before, she requires more. But all presidential candidates need some help: those candidates, like the Republican Fred Thompson, who have become too enamored with the notion of running a \u201cviral\u201d, nontraditional campaign from the confines of their living rooms have usually failed miserably. Is she hiring good pollsters, media strategists, fundraisers, consultants, logisticians, and advertising gurus? If so, she may still be as likely as anyone to prevail from a large, but fairly weak, Republican field. If not, her campaign, if she decides to run one, is liable to be a bust.",

      "author": "By Alan Rappeport",
      "content": "Donald J. Trump appears to be making a serious play for the \u201cMama Grizzly\u201d vote. This week the Republican presidential candidate flattered Sarah Palin \u2014 who gave herself the bear of a nickname \u2014 calling her a \u201cstrong\u201d and \u201cspecial\u201d person and proclaiming that he would love to have her in his cabinet if he won the White House. On Thursday, Mr. Trump showed another sign of respect for Ms. Palin, hiring Michael Glassner to be his campaign\u2019s national political director. Mr. Glassner was chief of staff for Ms. Palin\u2019s political action committee and worked closely with her when she ran for vice president alongside Senator John McCain in 2008. \u201cMr. Glassner will certainly be an asset to us as we further cement our dominance in the 2016 G.O.P. field,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a statement. Mr. Trump\u2019s anti-establishment persona and sometimes angry rhetoric has tapped into the frustration that many Republicans feel toward centrists in the party. A comparison of Quinnipiac polls from this summer and 2011, when Ms. Palin was considering her own presidential bid before deciding against it, shows that she and Mr. Trump both have strong appeal among Catholics, evangelical Christians, lower income voters and those without a college education. Ms. Palin\u2019s supporters have taken notice of Mr. Trump\u2019s attention, and many are hopeful it will pave the way for her return to\u00a0politics. Ms. Palin\u2019s Facebook page tends to be a forum for venting against Democrats, but lately it has become a platform for pushing a Trump/Palin ticket. \u201cI\u2019m hoping Sarah will run with Donald Trump when the time comes,\u201d Rose Hamilton wrote on Ms. Palin\u2019s page. \u201cI think they will be the dynamic duo and be great for our country.\u201d Rick Lewis of Iowa suggested that Ms. Palin would make the perfect secretary of state in a Trump administration, presumably complementing his economic expertise. Some of Ms. Palin\u2019s supporters, however, still feel that she would be selling herself short settling for a vice presidential slot again. \u201cMy dream ticket, however, would have Sarah at the top of the ticket!\u201d said John Gregory, of Oregon. For her part, Ms. Palin has shown little interest in running for office again, but she does toy with the idea on occasion. At a\u00a0\u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d 40th Anniversary event this year, Ms. Palin joked,\u00a0\u201cJust hypothetically, what if I were to choose Donald Trump as my running mate?\u201d While it would be a dream ticket for comedians, Jerry Seinfeld was not amused. \u201cSarah, you\u2019re teasing us,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not nice.\u201d",

      "author": "",
      "content": "The argument over whether Sarah Palin was misinformed about the historical facts of Paul Revere\u2019s ride has moved to where bar bets go to be settled: Wikipedia. Since Ms. Palin described the ride last week while she was visiting Boston,  Wikipedia\u2019s Paul Revere article page has been the site of a mini \u201cedit war.\u201d And the page has gone from a little-visited one \u2014 2,000 or so page views a day \u2014  to a more heavily trafficked one, with54,000 on Saturday when Ms. Palin\u2019s comments were gaining the most news attention. Over the course of the weekend, people added sentences to the Revere article that repeated Ms. Palin\u2019s claims. It can be hard to discern motives for changes on Wikipedia, and in some cases people appeared to be attributing the claims to Ms. Palin in order to mock her. One editor, Tomwsulcer, added the following sentence:\u00a0 \u201cAccounts differ regarding the method of alerting the colonists; the generally accepted position is that the warnings were verbal in nature, although one disputed account suggested that Revere rang bells during his ride.\u201d When the discussion board for the Revere article was ringing with complaints that this was a lie, Tomwsulcer replied that it should be included as a theory because a prominent American politician, that is, Sarah Palin, had said it. \u201cIf you follow Wikipedia\u2019s rules,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwe must maintain a neutral position, representing the mainstream position as well as disputed versions.\u201d He lost the argument, but others have been searching history books to find evidence to support Ms. Palin\u2019s claims. One editor added the fact that the colonists on the eve of revolution were themselves British. That argument was included at the end of a passage stating that \u201cRevere did not shout the phrase later attributed to him (\u2018The British are coming!\u2019), largely because the mission depended on secrecy and the countryside was filled with British army patrols.\u201d By that logic, Revere did, as Ms. Palin put it,\u00a0 \u201cwarn the British\u201d \u2014\u00a0 namely, the rebel colonists who were still technically British subjects. But the battles continue, and recent changes to the Revere article have used more facts to undercut the additions that seem to support Ms. Palin. For example, on Monday, one editor added, \u201cEverything Revere told his British captors had a single goal, to move the soldiers away from Lexington, where he had left Hancock and Adams.\u201d As a result, the Revere article has become much longer, and much better sourced -\u2013 a version of what Wikipedia users call the \u201cStreisand Effect,\u201d which is described as when  \u201can attempt to hide or remove a piece of information has the unintended consequence of publicizing the information more widely.\u201d Ms. Palin\u2019s supporters have made their mark on the Paul Revere article at Conservapedia, a right-leaning version of a Wikipedia-like encyclopedia. The piece has been edited to read as follows: \u201cHe is famous for riding from Boston to Lexington, Massachusetts with William Dawes on the night of April 18, 1775 ringing bells to warn the British that colonists would exercise their natural rights to both bear arms and use them in an effort secede from the United Kingdom in response to Big Government bullying and interfering with Colony\u2019s Rights.\u201d",
