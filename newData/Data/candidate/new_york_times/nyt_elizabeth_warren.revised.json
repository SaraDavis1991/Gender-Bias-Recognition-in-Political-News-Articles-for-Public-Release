We take a look back at their debate performances.By Thomas KaplanPRINT EDITIONSeptember 12, 2019",

      "content": " HOUSTON \u2014 Ahead of Thursday\u2019s debate, we looked back at how the leading Democratic candidates \u2014 Joseph R. Biden Jr., Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren \u2014 performed in the first two debates. Here\u2019s a refresher on the high points, and low points, including some of the more memorable lines of the primary race so far. After a shaky performance in the first debate, Mr. Biden was somewhat steadier in his second appearance, including when he reached for a classic Bidenism to respond to talk from his opponents about \u201cMedicare for all\u201d and the failings of the current health care system. \u201cThis idea is a bunch of malarkey,\u201d he said, before warning about what a Medicare-for-all system would cost. Mr. Biden was on the receiving end of the most memorable attack in the debates so far, when Senator Kamala Harris of California confronted him over his comments about segregationist senators and his record on busing. \u201cThere are very few candidates who are able to connect on an emotional and personal level with voters the way Joe Biden typically does. But in that exchange with Harris, when she looked at him and gave an intensely personal anecdote, he fell far short of doing so.\u201d \u2014 Mo Elleithee, former spokesman for the Democratic National Committee, on the first debate \u201c@JoeBiden finally played the card he should have played in the last debate when @KamalaHarris challenged him on race. @BarackObama vetted his record and nominated him for Vice President.\u201d \u2014 David Axelrod, former chief strategist for President Barack Obama, on the second debate It\u2019s usually the moderator who cuts off a candidate. In this case Mr. Biden did it to himself, bringing to a close his lackluster response after Ms. Harris confronted him. Ms. Harris\u2019s attack on Mr. Biden over race and busing gave a jolt of energy to her campaign, attracting a surge in donations and a bump in the polls. By invoking her personal story, Ms. Harris also contrasted herself as a young, fresh face in the Democratic Party, as opposed to Mr. Biden\u2019s elder statesman status. In the second debate, Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii targeted Ms. Harris with a fierce attack on her record as a prosecutor. Ms. Gabbard said Ms. Harris owed an apology to \u201cthe people who suffered under your reign.\u201d Though Ms. Harris has defined herself as a \u201cprogressive prosecutor,\u201d Ms. Gabbard\u2019s attack highlighted a part of Ms. Harris\u2019s career that can be wielded against her in the primary race. \u201cHarris directly confronting Biden on busing/segregationists was historic, powerful, and unimaginable on a presidential stage until very recently, which is itself symptomatic of a world Biden is struggling to defend.\u201d \u2014 Rebecca Traister, writer-at-large for New York magazine, on the first debate \u201c@KamalaHarris has been on defense all night. A stark difference from the first debate.\u201d \u2014 Patti Solis Doyle, campaign manager for Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2008 presidential bid, on the second debate After Ms. Harris confronted Mr. Biden over busing, her campaign tried to capitalize on the moment by selling T-shirts showing a picture of Ms. Harris as a young girl. Mr. Sanders has put a big focus on his signature policy proposal, creating a Medicare-for-all system in the United States. \u201cI wrote the damn bill!\u201d he declared during the second debate. He has not let voters forget it: He has used the line many times on the campaign trail since then. During an exchange about climate change at the first debate, Mr. Sanders raised his hand to signal that he wanted to speak. But the moderators ignored him and turned instead to John Hickenlooper, the former governor of Colorado. The moment typified the night for Mr. Sanders, who at times all but disappeared from the conversation even as his ideas took center stage at the debate. \u201cThese Bernie lines seem very familiar. Is he there or just a hologram?\u201d \u2014 Mr. Axelrod on the first debate \u201cI tend to think candidates who do best in debates are the ones who appear the most committed to whatever it is they are selling. Hands down Bernie wins the health care section \u2014 most Dems are with him on it, and he showed outrage and anger when the gnats swarmed.\u201d \u2014 Scott Jennings, Republican strategist and adviser to Senator Mitch McConnell, on the second debate The line came during an exchange with Representative Tim Ryan of Ohio. The Sanders campaign quickly offered \u201cI wrote the damn bill\u201d stickers in exchange for campaign donations. Ms. Warren found a convenient foil in John Delaney, the former Maryland congressman, who argued in the second debate that the progressive policies she advocates were unrealistic. Ms. Warren\u2019s candidacy revolves around the idea of fighting for sweeping change, and her comeback to Mr. Delaney \u2014 expressing bafflement about why someone would run for president with a message of discouraging big ideas \u2014 packed a punch. Ms. Warren made it through the first two debates without any glaring missteps. But one moment could be used against her in the future: when she raised her hand in support of abolishing private health insurance. A supporter of Medicare for all, Ms. Warren makes no apologies for taking that position. But her stance could provide ammunition to those seeking to paint her as too extreme in her progressive policies, including President Trump if she were to become the Democratic nominee. \u201cThey could teach classes in how @ewarren talks about a problem and weaves in answers into a story. She\u2019s not just wonk and stats.\u201d \u2014 Christina Reynolds, spokeswoman for Emily\u2019s List and former aide to Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, on the first debate \u201cBig difference in communication style: Sanders answers health care question by railing against the big health care companies. Warren answers by personalizing the issue, telling the story of a real person. The first is designed to rile people up. The second, to draw them in.\u201d \u2014 Mr. Elleithee on the second debate One thing is certain on Thursday night: This particular fight will not be revived, as Mr. Delaney failed to qualify for the debate.",

      "content": " Twitter can\u2019t tell us whether, or how, Thursday\u2019s debate might change voters\u2019 minds. But it can give us the perspectives of some of the people with expertise on primary races: veteran campaign strategists and consultants from both parties. Here is a sampling of their reactions. While there was no consensus on a single winner of the debate, the strategists generally agreed that Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts was near the top. But some also noted that she (and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, with whom Ms. Warren is ideologically aligned on many issues) faced more effective counterarguments than she had in past debates. Mr. Sanders had some good moments, the strategists agreed, but not as consistent or energizing a performance as Ms. Warren. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who had inconsistent showings in the last two debates, did very well in the first part of the debate, several strategists said. But when the moderator Linsey Davis asked him about his record on race and desegregation, he faltered. Senator Kamala Harris of California got good reviews for several exchanges, as well as for her focus on \u2014 baiting of, really \u2014 President Trump. Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former housing secretary, went after Mr. Biden early and hard, suggesting that his memory was failing. Strategists and commentators on both sides of the aisle cringed. But Mr. Castro did earn some praise at other points, including for his discussion of race, and some argued that \u2014 whatever the merits of his jab at Mr. Biden \u2014 his boldness was admirable. Several other candidates had bright moments but did not manage to stand out in the overall reckoning. As for the entrepreneur Andrew Yang, he drew a great deal of attention at the start for announcing that he would give 10 Americans $1,000 a month for a year. But by the time the debate ended three hours later, he had been greatly overshadowed.",

      "author": "Coral Davenport",
      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts released an ambitious new climate change plan on Tuesday, embracing goals laid out by a former presidential rival and calling for $3 trillion in spending over a decade to combat human-driven global warming. Ms. Warren made her announcement on the eve of a CNN town-hall-style event on global warming, which 10 top Democrats in the 2020 field are scheduled to attend on Wednesday \u2014 the first time in a presidential campaign that the question of what to do about the heating planet has merited its own major forum on prime-time television. Senator Kamala Harris of California is expected to put forth a detailed climate change plan on Wednesday morning, and three other Democratic presidential candidates \u2014 Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former housing secretary \u2014 have also released climate change plans since Sunday. Political analysts say the rush of plans is a sign that the issue has gained remarkable traction on the national stage, as scientific reports conclude that climate change is leading to dangerous outcomes for humanity, including more powerful hurricanes, stronger droughts and shortages of food and water. The forum comes as Hurricane Dorian moves \u201cdangerously close\u201d to Florida after inflicting devastating damage to the Bahamas, where at least seven people died. Ms. Warren\u2019s new climate plan explicitly adopts ideas from Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington, who focused his presidential campaign on combating climate change but dropped out last month after it became clear he was unlikely to qualify for the next primary debate. Ms. Warren met with Mr. Inslee last week in Seattle, according to two people familiar with their discussions. \u201cWhile his presidential campaign may be over, his ideas should remain at the center of the agenda,\u201d Ms. Warren wrote in her new climate plan. Mr. Inslee released six detailed climate plans, totaling over 200 pages, which were widely praised by environmental policy experts for their rigor. He said he hoped they would help \u201craise the ambition\u201d of other candidates\u2019 climate policies, and he has since had conversations with several candidates about how to incorporate his ideas into their plans, said his former campaign spokesman, Jared Leopold. In her new proposal, Ms. Warren adopts Mr. Inslee\u2019s plan to eliminate planet-warming emissions from power plants, vehicles and buildings over 10 years, and adds an additional $1 trillion in spending to subsidize that transition. The spending would be paid for, she says, by reversing the Trump administration\u2019s tax cuts for wealthy individuals and corporations. Like Mr. Inslee\u2019s proposal, her plan would set regulations aimed at retiring coal-fired electricity within a decade, but also fund health care and pensions for coal miners. It would create new federal regulations on vehicle tailpipe emissions with the goal of achieving zero emissions from new light-duty passenger vehicles, medium-duty trucks and buses by 2030. In April, Ms. Warren released a plan to ban fossil-fuel leasing on public lands. In June, she unveiled a proposal calling for $2 trillion in spending on \u201cgreen manufacturing,\u201d which is incorporated in her new, broader climate plan. Mr. Castro\u2019s plan, also released Tuesday, includes several ideas either directly adopted from or developed in consultation with Mr. Inslee, such as a plan to replace all coal-fired power generation with zero-emissions sources by 2030, and a proposal to marshal $10 trillion in federal, state, local and private spending on jobs associated with the transition from polluting to nonpolluting energy. Democratic strategists said that Mr. Inslee\u2019s influence on the rest of the party\u2019s presidential field was clear. \u201cInslee is one of those rare candidates who did not last for more than a few months but had a big impact on the race,\u201d said Robert Shrum, a veteran Democratic consultant and director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at the University of Southern California. \u201cHis candidacy is over, but his ideas do live on.\u201d Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a rival of Ms. Warren\u2019s on the left, has not explicitly taken up Mr. Inslee\u2019s ideas. Instead, analysts said, he is trying to win over the progressive wing of the Democratic Party with a climate plan that takes its name from the Green New Deal and has the biggest price tag of all the candidates\u2019 proposals \u2014 $16.3 trillion over 15 years. He has called for banning fracking to extract natural gas and halting the import and export of coal, oil and natural gas. \u201cI think Sanders is looking for ways to prove that he\u2019s the true progressive in the race,\u201d said Paul Bledsoe, a lecturer at American University\u2019s Center for Environmental Policy. Polls reflect that climate change is a rising concern among voters. In a poll published by Quinnipiac University last week, a majority of registered voters nationwide, 56 percent, said that climate change is an emergency. That majority included 84 percent of Democrats, while 81 percent of Republicans said that climate change is not an emergency. Among 18- to 34-year-old voters, who may expect to be the most affected by climate change, 74 percent said that climate change is an emergency. Voters also think that the United States is not doing enough to address climate change, with 67 percent saying more needs to be done. Republican officials say the plans that Democrats have devised to address climate change will decimate the economy. Mandy Gunasekara, a former policy adviser at the Environmental Protection Agency under the Trump administration, branded Democrats\u2019 plans as socialist takeovers of the economy. \u201cMost Americans who talk about climate change, when you ask them, \u2018O.K., how much are you willing to pay,\u2019 it\u2019s minimal to none. These trillion-dollar plans that each of them are putting up need some measure of honesty,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat are the true costs and how are the costs going to be borne? And what are the implications for our fossil workers?\u201d Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for President Trump\u2019s re-election campaign, wrote in an email, \u201cThe Democrats\u2019 radical approach to energy is to eliminate the use of all fossil fuels, which would kill more than 10 million jobs and inflict economic catastrophe across the country.\u201d Mr. Bledsoe said there was some political danger for Democrats in attempting to outdo one another. \u201cIn all honesty, every one of the climate plans proposed is more ambitious than anything that\u2019s ever been remotely contemplated before,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, these are just off-the-charts ambitious, so in that sense activists have gotten what they wanted. But the danger is that they ignore the nuts and bolts of energy politics of swing states and risk handing Trump the election.\u201d",

Now a more combative phase of the race seems inevitable.By Alexander Burns and Katie GlueckPRINT EDITION2 Democrats In No Hurry To Do Battle|September 14, 2019, Page A1",
      "author": "Alexander Burns",
      "content": "  If Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Elizabeth Warren are headed for a showdown, neither of them appears in a hurry to get there. The two candidates have seemed to be on a collision course for much of the last few months: Mr. Biden as the Democratic front-runner and de facto leader of the party\u2019s moderate wing, with a steady but hardly dominant lead in polls, and Ms. Warren as his rising challenger, slowly trimming his lead and perhaps surpassing Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont as the focal point of progressive energy in the race. Despite some pre-debate chest-thumping by Mr. Biden\u2019s camp, no great clash occurred in Thursday\u2019s debate in Houston, the first time he and Ms. Warren have been onstage together during the primary. It is almost inevitable that the race will grow more combative, and in the wake of the debate there were signs that some of the leading candidates were ready for conflict. Mr. Biden, who only challenged Ms. Warren in a single exchange on health care Thursday, delivered a veiled swipe at her policy-heavy campaign at a fund-raiser on Friday, saying that the country needed not just plans but also \u201csomeone who can execute a plan.\u201d And Mr. Sanders sought to reignite his own clash with Mr. Biden, releasing a statement from his campaign manager that accused Mr. Biden of \u201cechoing the deceptions and falsehoods of the health care industry.\u201d Ms. Warren, for her part, ignored the back-and-forth, seemingly content with a debate performance that her campaign said had presented her \u201clike a president.\u201d Supporters of Mr. Biden claimed encouragement from what they called the best of his three debates, but his tendency to garble his words, and his dated instincts on sensitive matters of culture and race, are sure to be tested even more strenuously in the coming months. [Here are six takeaways from the September Democratic debate.] Ms. Warren, the Massachusetts senator, and Mr. Sanders are plainly unintimidated by Mr. Biden\u2019s lead in the polls. While he has a solid electoral base,\u00a0made up chiefly of moderates, older voters and African-Americans, he has not gained new support since he entered the race, and now appears vulnerable to defeat in at least three of the four early primary and caucus states \u2014 Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada. \u201cThe question is, who is trying to play a long game, against Biden and for the nomination,\u201d said Dan Sena, a strategist who helped oversee the Democratic takeover of the House last year. Mr. Sena, who is now advising Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, a presidential candidate who failed to qualify for the Houston debate, suggested that Ms. Warren appeared satisfied with pursuing her own gradual and disciplined strategy. \u201cMy suspicion,\u201d he said, \u201cis that the Warren campaign in particular is looking at a much, much longer runway.\u201d Among Ms. Warren\u2019s goals in the near term are to consolidate her backing from liberals and expand her appeal to lower-income voters and minorities. Attacking Mr. Biden might not serve either goal. In the debate, Ms. Warren spent far more time highlighting her upbringing in a working-class Oklahoma family than engaging on any level with Mr. Biden. She must also still navigate the enduring presence of Mr. Sanders on the left. And Mr. Biden may have more immediate challenges. On Thursday night, he repeatedly expressed himself imprecisely \u2014 saying at one point that no nonviolent criminals should be in jail, when he meant to refer only to nonviolent drug offenders. He also referred to himself as the vice president of the United States, without appending the modifier \u201cformer.\u201d In a moment that drew criticism after the debate, Mr. Biden responded to a question about the legacy of slavery with a meandering answer that wound up involving a recommendation to place social workers in the homes of parents who \u201cdon\u2019t quite know what to do.\u201d Those parents, he suggested, might do well to \u201cmake sure you have the record player on at night\u201d so that young children grow up hearing more words \u2014 a suggestion he has made more broadly at other times, though he does not typically allude to that particular technology. [Sign up for our politics newsletter hosted by Lisa Lerer and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race.] Mr. Biden\u2019s obvious unsteadiness at certain moments opened the way for other candidates to question his strength as a challenger to President Trump. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, appearing on CNN after the debate, noted that Mr. Biden \u201ctends to go on sometimes,\u201d and depicted him as out of touch. \u201cAt one point, he\u2019s talking about people in communities like mine listening to record players \u2014 I don\u2019t remember the last time I saw a record player,\u201d Mr. Booker said, adding, \u201cThere are definitely moments when you\u2019re listening to Joe Biden and you just wonder.\u201d Mr. Biden and his campaign surrogates have taken umbrage at suggestions that he has slipped in his political acuity, and on Friday they pushed back particularly hard on Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former federal housing secretary, for having bitingly questioned Mr. Biden\u2019s recall of his own policies in the debate. Mr. Castro, who is polling near the bottom of the field, was the only candidate to attack Mr. Biden in such strong terms, drawing backlash that illustrated why other candidates had shunned that approach. Asked by a reporter Friday whether he would release his medical records to address \u201cconcerns,\u201d Mr. Biden, 76, said he would do so before votes are cast. \u201cWhat the hell concerns, man, you want to wrestle?\u201d he said lightheartedly. He continued, \u201cWhen I get the next physical. Look, I\u2019ll release my \u2014 before there\u2019s a first vote, that\u2019s \u2014 I\u2019ll release my medical records. There\u2019s no, I mean there\u2019s no reason for me not to release my medical records.\u2019\u2019 In Mr. Biden\u2019s camp, there is a persistent sense that his rivals and the news media are underestimating him and giving him too little credit for the blocs of support he has already claimed. Whatever the flaws in Mr. Biden\u2019s performance in Houston, there was no exchange in which an opponent obviously routed him, as Senator Kamala Harris of California did in the first debate and Mr. Booker did in the second. He has faced many controversies throughout the campaign, his allies note, and he is still in the lead \u2014 a reflection, they argue, of the good will he enjoys from rank-and-file Democrats who feel that they already know him and who see him as best positioned to defeat Mr. Trump. Still, Mr. Biden may have exposed his anxieties about Ms. Warren in the one debate exchange that pitted him against her. He used his very first answer of the night to chide Ms. Warren for calling for the replacement of the Affordable Care Act with a \u201cMedicare for All\u201d-style system. Ms. Warren declined to swipe back; instead, she praised the A.C.A. but said it could be improved upon. [Here\u2019s the latest data on who\u2019s leading the race to be the Democratic nominee.] Mr. Biden never went after Ms. Warren again. It was a more restrained performance than what several of his campaign surrogates had seemed to forecast, suggesting that he would question the pragmatism of Ms. Warren\u2019s policies. Instead, the differences that emerged between Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren arose largely by implication: the side-by-side contrasts between Mr. Biden\u2019s manner of speech and Ms. Warren\u2019s crisp, detailed answers; or between his proud ownership of the ideological middle and her refusal to be outflanked by other liberals. Allies of Mr. Biden pointed to the exchange over health care as an example of how he would draw contrasts with Ms. Warren and other candidates without becoming venomous. \u201cHe made clear that everybody knew about the differences in their two health care plans,\u201d said Representative Cedric Richmond, a Louisiana Democrat and Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign co-chairman. Asked about Mr. Biden\u2019s aversion to making personal attacks onstage, Mr. Richmond said: \u201cIt\u2019s not his style, he would never do that.\u201d Indeed, Mr. Biden, who served for decades as a senator from Delaware, at times acted more like a man on the Senate floor than someone in a crowded presidential field, referring to Ms. Warren as his \u201cdistinguished friend\u201d as he raised questions about her plan to pay for single-payer health care. \u201cThere\u2019s no pressure at this point for either one of them to go on the attack,\u201d said Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster. \u201cThe potential downside is, frankly, much more likely than the upside.\u201d The relative lack of engagement between Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren may carry risks, too. For Mr. Biden, there is the chance that holding back against Ms. Warren could allow her to amass momentum that would make her harder to overcome later on. And for Ms. Warren, there is the possibility that her status as the challenger who is creating the most buzz could pass to a rival candidate \u2014 perhaps someone more eager to make the case against Mr. Biden directly. Kathy Sullivan, a former head of the New Hampshire Democratic Party, said it would be a mistake to write off the rest of the field in favor of the top two or three candidates. \u201cI know people still want to focus on Sanders and Biden and Warren and say it\u2019s a three-person race,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s accurate. I think it\u2019s a mistake and it would be unfortunate if people didn\u2019t give all of these other candidates a good look, too.\u201d",

      "content": "  For 18 years and four presidential elections, Democrats running for president have felt compelled to lay out comprehensive plans for the future of Afghanistan, vowing to never again let the country become a breeding ground for terrorists who could strike the United States as they did on Sept. 11, 2001. Now, the candidates are racing one another \u2014 and President Trump \u2014 to demonstrate how quickly they would end the long-running conflict. In the debate on Thursday night, there was almost no discussion of American goals for the country, like building a democracy or protecting the rights of women \u2014 objectives that were staples of past Democratic campaigns. It is a striking change. Even while deeply opposing President George W. Bush\u2019s war in Iraq, Democrats saw Afghanistan as the good war, prompted by a direct attack on the United States. President Barack Obama ordered a surge in American forces by the end of his first year in office. But as the years went by, he had growing doubts, and now Democrats have fully embraced those misgivings and want out. Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. are so eager for the United States to depart that they say they would pull out combat troops even in the absence of an agreement with the Taliban. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing right now in Afghanistan is not helping the safety and security of the United States,\u201d Ms. Warren said during the debate. \u201cIt is not helping the safety and security of the world. It is not helping the safety and security of Afghanistan.\u201d \u201cWe cannot ask our military to keep solving problems that cannot be solved militarily,\u201d she added. A foreign policy adviser to Mr. Sanders, who has said he would withdraw all American troops from Afghanistan in his first term as president, echoed that argument in an interview on Friday, saying that while Mr. Sanders supported negotiations with the Taliban, the next president should be \u201cmodest about what we, the United States, can actually achieve given that we\u2019ve been there for almost two decades.\u201d Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., and the only candidate to have served in Afghanistan, acknowledged during an interview over the weekend that what the Democrats missed last week was any discussion of what the United States still wanted or needed to achieve in Afghanistan \u2014 the first step toward determining what kind of presence to have on the ground. \u201cI will say I agree that didn\u2019t come through in the debate,\u201d said Mr. Buttigieg, who has pledged to withdraw the troops within a year of taking office, but only with a substantive peace deal with the Taliban. \u201cIt almost came across as if the candidates think there is no point to being there, which is not how I view it.\u201d Mr. Buttigieg said that could be a reflection of wariness over \u201cendless war,\u201d and the confusion generated by a conflict in which the American goals have often seemed to shift. He recalled that when he exercised at the gym at the headquarters of the international security force in Kabul,  he would stare at a large graphic that had \u201ceight lines of effort on it, and it was very hard to understand what the scope of the mission was.\u201d Yet even the central goal of protecting the American homeland from another attack, a staple of John Kerry\u2019s run for the presidency in 2004 and Mr. Obama\u2019s in 2008, barely gets a mention now. Mr. Kerry told The New York Times in 2004 that any effective Afghanistan plan \u201crequires destroying terrorists. And I\u2019m committed to doing that. But I think I have a better way of doing it.\u201d Five years later, Mr. Obama overruled warnings from his ambassador in Kabul that his administration\u2019s plan to surge troops into the country, then depend on the Afghan government to defend itself, would probably not work. Speaking at West Point, Mr. Obama said he had \u201cdetermined that it is in our vital national interest to send an additional 30,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan. After 18 months, our troops will begin to come home.\u201d Quietly, his White House set up an \u201cAfghan Good Enough\u201d committee to find an exit. The current presidential candidates seem uninterested in revisiting those decisions. Instead, they race to reassure voters about how quickly they would bring the remaining 14,000 troops home. To some Democrats who devoted years to stabilizing Afghanistan, the candidates are losing an opportunity to take on Mr. Trump for what they view as a feckless foreign policy, one in which the president is trying to rush through a bare-bones peace agreement with the Taliban so that he can announce major troop withdrawals before the 2020 election. \u201cIt would be unworthy of the U.S. to leave the Afghan people and government to the mercies of the Taliban in an unequal agreement,\u201d R. Nicholas Burns, a former under secretary of state for policy and now an adviser to Mr. Biden, said over the weekend. As ambassador to NATO in the early years of the war, Mr. Burns took allies to Afghanistan to persuade them to join the coalition, declaring that it was in their own interest to stabilize the country, where 2,400 Americans have died in combat, along with 1,000 troops from NATO and other nations. \u201cTrump has displayed astonishingly weak negotiating skills by signaling to the Taliban his desperation to withdraw American forces ahead of the 2020 election,\u201d he said. But if the Taliban were tuned into the recent debates, or were reviewing the positions the candidates have posted on their websites, they would most likely conclude that no matter who gets elected, they are on the verge of achieving their central goal: getting American forces out of the country. Mr. Biden himself, a voice for more rapid withdrawal during the Obama administration, now advocates keeping an intelligence presence \u2014 though in the debate he said it would be across the border in Pakistan. \u201cWe can prevent the United States from being the victim of terror coming out of Afghanistan by providing for bases \u2014 insist the Pakistanis provide bases for us to airlift from and to move against what we know,\u201d Mr. Biden said after one of the moderators quoted Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, saying that Afghanistan still needed military support to prevent violence. \u201cWe don\u2019t need those troops there. I would bring them home.\u201d Mr. Biden\u2019s longtime national security adviser, Antony Blinken, refined that on Sunday, saying the candidate would \u201cdraw down our combat forces and narrowly focus the mission on counterterrorism, with small numbers of special operators and intelligence assets in and around Afghanistan. He would rally the world to support Afghans\u2019 human rights and continued development efforts.\u201d Senator Kamala Harris of California said in an interview with The Times this year that while she supported withdrawing troops, she believed the United States needed some sort of continued presence in Afghanistan to support the government and stop terrorists from regrouping. \u201cThe question is the type of presence,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that it is completely appropriate that we would give support to the Afghan government in terms of helping them train their troops and thinking about how we can provide assistance so that they can have their own people up and running in a way that they keep their country secure, and in particular prevent it from becoming a haven\u201d for terrorists. One of the curious elements of the presidential campaign is that Afghanistan has been the only foreign policy issue actively debated among Democrats. There has been little to no debate about the far bigger strategic questions raised by the revival of superpower tensions with Russia and China. The growing confrontation with Iran and the president\u2019s dealings with Kim Jong-un of North Korea have barely been mentioned. Perhaps that is because the Afghan conundrum is so familiar to voters, and goes to a central question: When would these aspirants for the Oval Office use traditional military force? Mr. Buttigieg \u2014 noting that Congress\u2019s 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force has allowed the war in Afghanistan to continue for so long that, very soon, the soldiers fighting it will include people who were not born when the law was passed \u2014 said that as president, he would put a three-year limit on such authorizations and require a congressional vote to renew them for longer. \u201cIf there\u2019s one thing we\u2019ve learned from Afghanistan,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s that the best way not to be caught up in endless war is to avoid starting one in the first place.\u201d None of the candidates seem particularly impressed by the argument that withdrawing troops would create a vacuum in Afghanistan for the Taliban and other terrorist groups to fill. \u201cIt\u2019s a false choice to say we need an enduring combat presence in Afghanistan or we open ourselves to an unmanageable terrorist threat,\u201d a spokeswoman for Ms. Warren said. \u201cInternational terrorism is a worldwide challenge, and it is best confronted not with boots on the ground in Afghanistan, but instead with diplomacy and intelligence and through coordination with partners and allies.\u201d Mr. Sanders would continue the United States\u2019 intelligence presence in Afghanistan, according to his campaign, but focus on humanitarian and developmental incentives, not military pressure, to bring the Taliban to the table and reach a peace deal. He and Ms. Warren  made very similar arguments. \u201cI was in Afghanistan with John McCain two years ago this past summer,\u201d Ms. Warren said at the debate. \u201cWe talked to people on the ground and asked the question, the same one I ask on the Senate Armed Services Committee every time one of the generals comes through: \u2018Show me what winning looks like. Tell me what it looks like.\u2019 And what you hear is a lot of \u2018Uh,\u2019 because no one can describe it. And the reason no one can describe it is because the problems in Afghanistan are not problems that can be solved by a military.\u201d",

President Trump, in New Mexico, denounced a \u201cfailed liberal establishment.\u201dBy Alexander BurnsPRINT EDITIONThey Agree on Fighting Corruption, but Not on What\u2019s Corrupt|September 18, 2019, Page A13",
      "author": "Alexander Burns",
      "content": " Senator Elizabeth Warren stood beneath a marble arch in New York City, telling a crowd of thousands that she would lead a movement to purge the government of corruption. Not far from the site of a historic industrial disaster, Ms. Warren described Washington as utterly compromised by the influence of corporations and the extremely wealthy, and laid out a detailed plan for cleansing it. \u201cCorruption has put our planet at risk, corruption has broken our economy and corruption is breaking our democracy,\u201d Ms. Warren said Monday evening. \u201cI know what\u2019s broken, I\u2019ve got a plan to fix it and that\u2019s why I\u2019m running for president of the United States.\u201d Only a few hours later, on a stage outside Albuquerque, President Trump took aim at a different phenomenon that he also described as corruption. Before his own roaring crowd, Mr. Trump cast himself as a bulwark against the power not of corporations but of a \u201cfailed liberal establishment\u201d that he described as attacking the country\u2019s sovereignty and cultural heritage. \u201cWe\u2019re battling against the corrupt establishment of the past,\u201d Mr. Trump said, warning in grim language: \u201cThey want to erase American history, crush religious liberty, indoctrinate our students with left-wing ideology.\u201d [Read about Elizabeth Warren\u2019s speech on corruption in government, and President Trump\u2019s speech at a rally in New Mexico.] The two back-to-back addresses laid out the competing versions of populism that could come to define the presidential campaign. From the right, there is the strain Mr. Trump brought to maturity in 2016, combining the longstanding grievances of the white working class with a newer, darker angst about immigration and cultural change. And on the left, there is a vastly different populist wave still gaining strength, defined in economic terms by Ms. Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. The messages underlined the possibility that the 2020 election could be the first in a generation to be fought without an ally of either party\u2019s centrist establishment on the ballot. While it is by no means certain that Ms. Warren will emerge as the Democratic nominee, two of her party\u2019s top three candidates \u2014 Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders \u2014 are trumpeting themes of economic inequality and promises of sweeping political and social reform. Their version of populism, which Mr. Sanders pioneered but did not bring to fruition when he challenged Hillary Clinton in 2016, is about attacking concentrated wealth and economic power and breaking its influence over government. Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders, effectively tied for second place in their party\u2019s primary, both describe the country\u2019s political institutions as rotten and vow to make vast changes to the economy. They are both trailing behind Joseph R. Biden Jr., the former vice president, in the Democratic race; Mr. Biden has run on a far more conventional message of making gradual policy improvements from the center-left, and he has expressed reservations about the rhetoric of his more liberal rivals about corporations and billionaires. The party is currently locked in a grand debate over how best to build an electoral majority, and whether Democrats would be better off appealing to voters with a soothing promise of returning to normalcy or with a more activist message about economic and social injustice. [Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter.] These divergent strains of populism are far from new in American politics: for much of the country\u2019s modern history, mass social movements channeling grievances with government or big business have competed with other forces directing outrage at racial and cultural minorities, immigrants and foreign countries. To some Democrats, the task of delivering a credible message of changing a broken system in Washington is a defining challenge of the 2020 election. Tiffany Muller, head of the influential clean-government group End Citizens United, said her organization\u2019s research showed that many swing voters still see Mr. Trump as a political outsider with what Ms. Muller called an undeserved veneer of ethical independence. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen is that Trump actually maintains strength on this issue \u2014 that, frankly, voters don\u2019t know who to trust on the issue of corruption and cleaning up Washington,\u201d Ms. Muller said in an interview on Monday afternoon. \u201cWe have got to go after his strength on this issue and win back some of the voters we lost in 2016.\u201d Ms. Warren proposed a battery of new reforms in her remarks in New York City\u2019s Washington Square Park, near the 1911 Triangle Shirtwaist factory fire that she cited as an example of the oppression of the working class. And she highlighted an array of other reforms she has previously outlined, including a ban on lobbying by foreign governments and new ethics regulations on presidents and judges. She presented herself not just as an opponent of Mr. Trump, whom she called \u201ccorruption in the flesh,\u201d but of the Washington system writ large. \u201cToo many politicians in both parties have convinced themselves that playing the money-for-influence game is the only way to get things done,\u201d Ms. Warren said, vowing to do things differently: \u201cNo more business as usual. Let\u2019s attack the corruption head-on.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s version of populism is starkly different and, to most voters, already well known. While he has periodically taken rhetorical aim at certain big corporations, like pharmaceutical companies, he has largely abandoned early efforts to make good on his drain-the-swamp rhetoric from the 2016 campaign, and he has faced a barrage of ethical questions about the intermingling of his hotel and real estate business with the work of the government. He has invited business executives and lobbyists into his administration and a number of cabinet departments and agencies have drawn close scrutiny for potential conflicts of interest, including the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of the Interior. But Mr. Trump has still positioned himself for re-election as an anti-establishment brawler, in the same mode that helped him pull away blue-collar whites from Mrs. Clinton three years ago. He has continued to combine blue-collar concerns about issues like foreign trade with culturally conservative priorities like gun rights and immigration restriction. And Mr. Trump has at times aligned himself with leaders of right-wing movements in countries like France and Brazil who share his contempt for cultural elites. In New Mexico on Monday, Mr. Trump avoided some of the more incendiary appeals to bigotry that he has made in the past, but still repeated a set of blunt warnings to the crowd: Democrats, he said, would enact immigration policies that would imperil their jobs and \u201cturn every city in America into a sanctuary for criminal aliens.\u201d And in a state where oil and gas production is a major source of employment, Mr. Trump claimed Democrats would impose environmental policies that would empower \u201cforeign producers\u201d and sap profitable industries. \u201cUnder the Green New Deal, that all goes away,\u201d Mr. Trump said, caricaturing Democrats as seeking to eliminate cars and airplanes. \u201cThey\u2019ll call us the hermit nation \u2014 we\u2019ll never leave our house.\u201d If Mr. Trump castigated Democrats and liberals as a collective group, he offered no particular critique of Ms. Warren or Mr. Sanders, or the distinctive policies they have put forward, with the exception of their shared endorsement of a \u201cMedicare for all\u201d-style health care system. His lone reference to Ms. Warren was a jab at her contested claims of Native American ancestry, a mocking personal attack that Mr. Trump said was \u201ccoming back.\u201d Ms. Warren, for her part, only mentioned Mr. Trump in a relatively brief passage of her speech, saying that he pits people against each other on the basis of their identity so that they won\u2019t \u201cnotice that he and his buddies are stealing more and more of our country\u2019s wealth.\u201d",

Bernie Sanders, Pete Buttigieg and Cory Booker also attracted particularly energetic support.By Katie GlueckPRINT EDITIONAt a Democratic Event in New Hampshire, Warren Stands Out|September 8, 2019, Page A18",
      "author": "Katie Glueck",
      "content": " MANCHESTER, N.H. \u2014 Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s backers roared supportive slogans and banged on drums as they awaited his arrival outside Southern New Hampshire University Arena. Senator Bernie Sanders was welcomed by die-hard fans ready to cheer seemingly every sentence he uttered. Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Senator Cory Booker delivered one applause line after the next. But no one was embraced at the New Hampshire Democratic Party\u2019s state convention Saturday quite like Elizabeth Warren. The Massachusetts senator took the stage to a standing ovation that lasted around two minutes, and the thunderous applause that frequently interrupted her speech was amplified by the inflatable noisemakers that had been distributed to the crowd. \u201cWin with Warren!\u201d attendees yelled. \u201cThere is a lot at stake, and people are scared,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we can\u2019t choose a candidate we don\u2019t believe in because we\u2019re scared.\u201d It\u2019s a version of a line that Ms. Warren has deployed before, though it took on new significance days before she faces off against Mr. Biden \u2014 who is running explicitly on a message of electability \u2014 for the first time on the presidential debate stage. Ms. Warren and Mr. Biden were two of 19 candidates who assembled here for a daylong party gathering that attracted some of the state\u2019s most committed activists, including more than 1,200 delegates. The event was an imperfect test of the New Hampshire primary electorate \u2014 indeed, there were plenty of attendees who came from out of state. An unknown number of Warren supporters came to the event from outside New Hampshire, judging from several social media posts of Democratic backers from Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island and elsewhere who came to the convention for her on Saturday. Out-of-state supporters for candidates including Mr. Biden and Senator Kamala Harris also attended the event, according to interviews and social media posts. Campaigns often bus in some supporters and allies for major events.  It was not clear on Saturday night to what extent the different campaigns coordinated the importing of supporters. A Warren spokeswoman declined to comment. Still, the event did offer an early window into campaign organization and enthusiasm, in a contest that is traditionally a must-win for candidates from neighboring states This cycle, that includes Mr. Sanders of Vermont, who won New Hampshire by a wide margin in 2016, and Ms. Warren, whose ground game is often regarded as the most extensive here. As he has nationally, Mr. Biden has led in most New Hampshire polls since entering the race \u2014 though the surveys have been relatively few, and his campaign last week sought to downplay expectations, citing the \u201chome-field advantage\u201d typically enjoyed by candidates from New England. Mr. Biden, who has landed endorsements from several of the most influential Democratic leaders in the state, is focused on blue-collar voters, moderates and others who believe his more centrist brand offers the most promising path to defeating President Trump, in contrast to the more progressive coalitions Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders are working to build. While many voters feel warmly toward Mr. Biden, some have also referenced calculations about his standing against Mr. Trump, rather than displaying outright enthusiasm for his vision for the country. In ways overt and subtle, both of those more liberal candidates and their supporters sought to challenge the idea that Mr. Biden is the only candidate who can win a general election. \u201cI am not afraid,\u201d Ms. Warren said as she called for a \u201cgrass-roots movement\u201d to create structural change. \u201cAnd for Democrats to win, you can\u2019t be afraid either.\u201d Meanwhile, inside the arena, a large banner read, \u201cBernie beats Trump.\u201d Outside, another banner affixed to a pro-Sanders tent read, \u201cIn poll after poll after poll \u2026 Bernie BEATS Trump.\u201d Mr. Sanders received frequent applause throughout his speech and his supporters \u2014 who appeared dispersed throughout the arena \u2014 greeted many of his remarks with loud whoops. \u201cTogether, we will make Donald Trump a one-term president,\u201d he said. \u201cBut frankly, frankly, it is not enough just to defeat Trump. We must do much, much more. We must finally create a government and an economy that works for all of us, not just the one percent.\u201d Mr. Biden, the former vice president, was the first of the presidential contenders to speak, and he received a polite though not raucous reception as attendees trickled into the arena. Taking aim at Mr. Trump, he said: \u201cWe cannot and I will not let this man be re-elected.\u201d The audience cheered, driven in part by a contingent from the International Association of Fire Fighters. \u201cThere\u2019s that sense of, we know who Joe is, and we trust him,\u201d said Sylvia Larsen, the former New Hampshire Senate president. \u201cThere\u2019s still a little bit of people still looking around to say, \u2018Well, O.K., so what else is out there?\u2019\u201d Mr. Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., was another prominent presence at the convention: He had a large cheering contingent that punctuated his address with rounds of applause. Flush with a field-leading fund-raising haul, his campaign has significantly expanded its presence in New Hampshire and has announced the opening of 12 new offices in the state. Senator Kamala Harris of California had a visible and vocal support section, too, boosted by her fans in bright yellow T-shirts. Yet Ms. Harris\u2019s standing in the polls has slipped over the summer, and party leaders here say she does not have the same footprint in the state as some of the other contenders. Perhaps reflecting those dynamics \u2014 and a lunchtime-hour speaking slot \u2014 her reception was uneven. \u201cEverybody else and the pundits can ride polls; I\u2019m not on that roller coaster,\u201d she told reporters after her speech. \u201cI am working hard, we are steady, I don\u2019t get high with the polls, I don\u2019t go low with the polls.\u201d Mr. Booker, too, found himself brushing off the polls, speaking to reporters after giving a well-received speech. His candidacy has mystified some veteran New Hampshire Democrats who note his relatively stagnant poll numbers despite extensive on-the-ground campaign organization, and mounting endorsements. Given the huge cast of candidates \u2014 and how seriously New Hampshire residents take their status as the first primary voters \u2014 many voters are in no mood to commit this early. It is another reminder that the polls could change dramatically before the primary next February. \u201cI think of it like getting an ice cream sundae and trying to decide what toppings you want to put on your ice cream, because they\u2019re very good choices, but I just can\u2019t make up my mind,\u201d said Jeanne Brown from Goffstown, N.H., who attended a Warren event in Bow, N.H., over the summer. \u201cYou know, I don\u2019t know if I want the gummy bears or the sprinkles.\u201d That same indecision was on display Saturday. \u201cI have been waving signs for all the candidates, as have most people on the floor,\u201d said State Representative Kris Schultz, a progressive leader who said that her top choices were Ms. Warren, Mr. Sanders and Mr. Booker \u2014 adding that the New Jersey senator is \u201camazing.\u201d \u201cLots of people remain undecided.\u201d And for all of the enthusiasm for Ms. Warren, some attendees continued to have reservations about her ability to defeat Mr. Trump. \u201cSenator Warren is probably the best campaigner out there, but in order to get elected against Trump I think she\u2019s going to have to moderate some of her priorities,\u201d said New Hampshire State Representative David Karrick Jr. Ahead of the event, activists and other voters rattled off lists of their top three choices, but repeatedly stressed that their rankings could shift. For at least one voter, they changed in a matter of moments. \u201cPete, Warren and then Biden,\u201d said Tim Ashe of Somersworth, N.H., referencing Mr. Buttigieg. \u201cThat may change.\u201d When asked why Mr. Buttigieg was his first choice, he replied, \u201cI was looking at a Pete sign when I said it.\u201d \u201cIf I had to vote today,\u201d he added, \u201cit would probably be for Warren.\u201d His wife, Laurie Ashe, said that she had supported John Kasich, the former Republican governor of Ohio, in the primary in 2016 and then voted for Hillary Clinton in the general election. Now, she said, she is supporting Ms. Warren, because \u201cregular people cannot work their way into the middle class anymore.\u201d Jonathan Martin contributed reporting from Bow, N.H.",

      "author": "Shane Goldmacher",
      "content": " On the highest floor of the tallest building in Boston, Senator Elizabeth Warren was busy collecting big checks from some of the city\u2019s politically connected insiders. It was April 2018 and Ms. Warren, up for re-election, was at a breakfast fund-raiser hosted for her by John M. Connors Jr., one of the old-guard power brokers of Massachusetts. Soon after, Ms. Warren was in Manhattan doing the same. There would be trips to Hollywood and Silicon Valley, Martha\u2019s Vineyard and Philadelphia \u2014 all with fund-raisers on the agenda. She collected campaign funds at the private home of at least one California megadonor, and was hosted by another in Florida. She held finance events until two weeks before her all-but-assured re-election last November. Then, early this year, Ms. Warren made a bold bet that would delight the left: She announced she was quitting this big-money circuit in the 2020 presidential primary, vowing not to attend private fund-raisers or dial up rich donors anymore. Admirers and activists praised her stand \u2014 but few noted the fact that she had built a financial cushion by pocketing big checks the years before. The open secret of Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign is that her big-money fund-raising through 2018 helped lay the foundation for her anti-big-money run for the presidency. Last winter and spring, she transferred $10.4 million in leftover funds from her 2018 Senate campaign to underwrite her 2020 run, a portion of which was raised from the same donor class she is now running against. As Ms. Warren has risen in the polls on her populist and anti-corruption message, some donors and, privately, opponents are chafing at her campaign\u2019s purity claims of being \u201c100 percent grass-roots funded.\u201d Several donors now hosting events for her rivals organized fund-raisers for her last year. \u201cCan you spell hypocrite?\u201d said former Gov. Ed Rendell of Pennsylvania, who contributed $4,000 to Ms. Warren in 2018 and is now supporting former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. Mr. Rendell said he had recruited donors to attend an intimate fund-raising dinner for Ms. Warren last year at Barclay Prime, a Philadelphia steakhouse where the famed cheesesteak goes for $120. (The dish includes Wagyu rib-eye, foie gras, truffled cheese whiz and a half-bottle of champagne.) He said he received a \u201cglowing thank-you letter\u201d from Ms. Warren afterward. But when Mr. Rendell co-hosted Mr. Biden\u2019s first fund-raiser this spring, Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign sent brickbats, deriding the affair as \u201ca swanky private fund-raiser for wealthy donors,\u201d the likes of which she now shuns. \u201cShe didn\u2019t have any trouble taking our money the year before,\u201d Mr. Rendell said. \u201cAll of a sudden, we were bad guys and power brokers and influence-peddlers. In 2018, we were wonderful.\u201d Supporters of Ms. Warren say her presidential campaign should not be criticized for trying to lessen the influence of big donors now, even if she wooed and benefited from them previously. \u201cThere\u2019s a perverse incentive system for public officials,\u201d said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which has endorsed Ms. Warren. If candidates continue the big-money status quo, he said, \u201cyou don\u2019t get called a hypocrite. But if you stick your neck out, take chances, challenge power, and try to change the system step by step, you get criticized for not taking every step possible all at once.\u201d Ms. Warren\u2019s surplus Senate cash has undergirded two important elements of her 2020 run. She was able to invest early in a massive political organization \u2014 spending 87 cents of every dollar she raised in early 2019 \u2014 without fear of bankrupting her bid, and she had that financial backstop to lessen the risk of forgoing traditional fund-raisers. \u201cIt gave her some running room,\u201d said Mary Anne Marsh, a Democratic strategist based in Massachusetts, though she still called banning fund-raisers a \u201cbig risk.\u201d Advisers to Ms. Warren defended her campaign finance decisions and noted that big-money fund-raisers, like the ones with Mr. Connors and Mr. Rendell, accounted for only about one-quarter of the $25.8 million she raised in 2017 and 2018. Kristen Orthman, Ms. Warren\u2019s communications director, said the senator \u201cbelieves that to take back the White House we need to build a grass-roots movement.\u201d \u201cWhen we made the decision to run the campaign this way, the players in the usual money-for-influence game dismissed it as na\u00efve and said it would never work and it would kill the campaign,\u201d Ms. Orthman said. \u201cWe\u2019re pleased that our grass-roots strategy has been so effective that they\u2019re now threatened enough to be attacking us for it.\u201d Since Ms. Warren\u2019s announcement in February, her disavowal of closed-door events with the donor class has become an inextricable part of the DNA of her candidacy as she promises to bring about structural change to American society. It is the reason, her campaign advisers say, that she has the time to dedicate to hourslong selfie lines, to expand the map of states she can visit, and to call up small donors at random to thank them for giving, rather than pleading for more $2,800 donations from the well-to-do. \u201cThe best president money can\u2019t buy,\u201d read campaign T-shirts and tank tops. That message \u2014 paired with a raft of ambitious policy proposals \u2014 resonated with enough small contributors to propel Ms. Warren to raise $19.2 million in the second quarter of 2019 (the third most in the field) and to the top tier in the polls. The only other Democratic candidate to bypass big-money events is her fellow liberal in the race, Senator Bernie Sanders. He has transferred $10.1 million from old accounts to his 2020 campaign, but, unlike Ms. Warren, he had eschewed high-dollar fund-raisers in past races. (Other senators transferred money into their 2020 bids as well.) There is no way to say exactly how much of the $10.4 million Ms. Warren transferred from 2018 was attributable to large donations. Her campaign said she had 380,000 donors to her re-election who gave an average of $30\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a strong grass-roots following. Records show about $6 million of her Senate funds also came from donors who gave $1,000 or more. Throughout 2017 and 2018, Ms. Warren paired appeals to small contributors with a robust operation courting big ones. In early 2017, Ms. Warren had created the Elizabeth Warren Action Fund, which could raise money above the $5,400 candidate limit. The extra funds went to her political action committee, which she would then redistribute to other party committees and politicians, and the Massachusetts Democratic Party; she closed the joint account in late 2018. Ms. Warren also traveled the country extensively to fund-raise, according to invitations obtained by The New York Times and people familiar with the events, though she often found a chillier reception in New York because of her anti-Wall Street rhetoric. In Florida, she was hosted for an event by the billionaires Henry and Marsha Laufer. In New York, Meyer S. Frucher, the vice chairman of Nasdaq, held a reception for her. She was hosted by the \u201cLost\u201d creator Damon Lindelof and his wife, Heidi, in Southern California. The philanthropist Stephen M. Silberstein had Ms. Warren over to his San Francisco-area home. And as late as the fall of 2018, she visited Silicon Valley, where Karla Jurvetson, a multimillion-dollar Democratic contributor, hosted an event for her. This year, Ms. Jurvetson also donated money to the Democratic National Committee on Ms. Warren\u2019s behalf,  as first reported by BuzzFeed, to help her campaign purchase information about voters (she was not solicited directly by Ms. Warren). Ms. Jurvetson declined to comment through a spokesman. Mr. Silberstein said he had bristled when he first heard Ms. Warren would stop doing events like the dinner he had held for her. \u201cMy first reaction was I was insulted,\u201d he said in an interview, but then came to see it as a \u201cgutsy move.\u201d \u201cAfter I sort of got over the fact that she wouldn\u2019t be calling me anymore, I saw that she made a big success out of it,\u201d he said. As the 2018 election neared, Ms. Warren\u2019s big money was partly bankrolling an apparent 2020 apparatus in waiting. Ms. Warren said in late September last year that she would \u201ctake a hard look\u201d at a White House run. Her Senate campaign notably aired zero television ads (as did Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, ahead of her run). Some of the money that Ms. Warren did not stockpile went to strategic giveaways and investments, such as deploying staff in the early nominating states of Iowa and New Hampshire in 2018. Ms. Warren continued to press for donations into October. Her campaign invited donors to attend a Senate debate watch event, with the added draw that Ms. Warren would visit after she got offstage. Her last fund-raising event, an intimate round table in Cambridge, came on Oct. 27. Sean Curran, who contributed $5,400 to Ms. Warren\u2019s Senate campaign but co-hosted an event for Senator Kamala Harris of California this year, said the move by Ms. Warren to forgo private fund-raisers now was \u201cconsistent with her values.\u201d \u201cIf any other candidate did this, I\u2019d say they were looking for the cheap political advantage,\u201d Mr. Curran said. The choice to swear off fund-raisers was certainly seen as fraught when she made it. Her finance director and another top fund-raising official quickly resigned. And in late March, she had to dip briefly into those Senate reserves, as her fund-raising briefly did not keep up with her spending. But the decision has proved a central selling point for Ms. Warren, who by the end of June had nearly $20 million in the bank and will stand at center stage with Mr. Biden at Thursday\u2019s debate. Steven Grossman, a Boston-area donor and former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, who contributed the maximum amount to Ms. Warren\u2019s 2018 campaign, said the biggest advantage of Ms. Warren\u2019s carry-over cash was the ability for her to invest in staff early on. \u201cEveryone else was playing catch-up ball,\u201d Mr. Grossman said. He is now a supporter of Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. Mr. Green, the Warren supporter, said her vow to skip fund-raisers had led to small donations. \u201cWhen we point out to our grass-roots that Elizabeth Warren needs you more because she\u2019s forgoing big-money fund-raising, that definitely is a more compelling pitch that results in more people taking out their credit card,\u201d he said. Ms. Warren has said her ban on fund-raisers only applies to the primary. Should she win the nomination, she would return to the events to compete with Republicans. (Faiz Shakir, campaign manager to Mr. Sanders, said the senator would not hold such fund-raisers if he is the nominee.) So how much did the Senate money help Ms. Warren get a jump on her presidential rivals? Here\u2019s one way to look at it: As of the end of June, only five candidates besides Ms. Warren, out of two dozen Democratic hopefuls, had even raised more than $10.4 million, the amount of her Senate transfer. \u201cCertainly it\u2019s a lot easier if you have $12 million as a starting point,\u201d Andrew Yang, the businessman and first-time candidate, said with a laugh. \u201cIf she hadn\u2019t, then it might have been a slightly different calculation.\u201d Mr. Yang went on: \u201cBut you can\u2019t begrudge something that someone has done at an earlier point if they decide to move in a direction that I personally think is very positive.\u201d",

      "content": " CHAPEL HILL, N.C. \u2014 College students are back on campus. Bernie Sanders is, too. Earlier this month at Iowa State University, he lectured to young voters as they played \u201cGreen New Deal Pong\u201d (the Solo cups were filled with green-colored water) and \u201cBern Bag Toss.\u201d At the University of Nevada, Reno, he croaked through a hoarse voice to address a crowd that stretched from the college lawn to the open-air floors of a parking garage beside it. And at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill on Thursday evening, he implored students to get themselves to the primary polls come February \u2014 and vote for him. \u201cYou have friends out there, and I know you do, who think that the political system\u201d is absurd, he said, using a colorful expletive. \u201cTell them that instead of just complaining, they must get involved into the political process.\u201d It was a sentiment he has repeated often this month as he crisscrossed the country on what has amounted to a whirlwind back-to-school tour. In Iowa, Nevada, North Carolina and South Carolina, he has by turns used flattery (\u201cYour generation is the most progressive younger generation in the history of this country\u201d) and subtle warnings (\u201cThe future of this country and in fact the world rests with your generation\u201d) to bolster his appeals. Everywhere, his goal was the same: muster a version of the army of young voters who propelled his campaign in 2016. His message was one that has resonated with Brianna Williams, 19, who arrived with a group of friends to hear him in Chapel Hill. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of his policies, and I\u2019m just excited for what he has to offer as a candidate,\u201d she said. But she was just as excited by Senator Elizabeth Warren. \u201cI would love to see a woman running the country,\u201d she said. \u201cThat would be really cool.\u201d Last time around, Mr. Sanders\u2019s rants against the elite and promises of free college tuition endeared him to legions of young fans. It also helped that Mr. Sanders \u2014 74 at the time, with unruly white hair and an old-school Brooklyn accent \u2014 was both decidedly uncool and new to presidential politics, affording his campaign a paradoxical edge that inspired millions of young supporters to \u201cfeel the bern\u201d and vote for him over Hillary Clinton. As he fights anew for the Democratic nomination, it is not lost on him or his allies that his success hinges, in no small part, on his ability to capture that enthusiasm again \u2014 for both the optics of his race and the actual votes. But this time he is no longer an insurgent, nor is he the only anti-establishment candidate in the race \u2014 factors that helped boost his standing among young voters. With the race entering the crucial fall period, other candidates, including Ms. Warren and Andrew Yang, have begun siphoning off some of his support. [Sign up for our politics newsletter hosted by Lisa Lerer and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race.] Even Mr. Sanders\u2019s closest advisers acknowledge that he cannot take for granted a voting cohort they view as critical, even if it is traditionally unreliable in actually making it to the ballot box. \u201cLast time it was much more organic,\u201d Faiz Shakir, Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign manager, said. \u201cAnd this time it\u2019s far more intentional.\u201d In interviews, many young voters still praised Mr. Sanders, sometimes breathlessly \u2014 citing his authenticity and conviction but also his calls for free college and universal health care and his proposal to cancel student debt. But many also expressed curiosity, if not exuberance, about other candidates \u201cI love everything he stands for,\u201d said Asha Loutsch, 18, as she sat with a circle of friends who were waiting for his event at the University of Iowa. \u201cI think he really cares about what he\u2019s trying to say. Like, he\u2019s always getting up in there, you know?\u201d But she also said she was interested in Ms. Warren and wanted to hear her speak. Jiego Lim, an 18-year-old student at the University of Nevada, Reno, who was volunteering at Mr. Sanders\u2019s event there, said he supported Mr. Sanders but was also intrigued by Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Senator Kamala Harris. \u201cI feel like we need a fresh new face in politics,\u201d he said. \u201cBernie comes off aggressive to me sometimes.\u201d Others were less equivocal. \u201cHe\u2019s America\u2019s dad,\u201d offered Gabriel Olier, 19, a student in Reno. \u201cI love Bernie.\u201d That affection for Mr. Sanders is reflected in some more tangible metrics. His campaign said it had so far raised over $1 million from people under the age of 25, a relatively small figure compared to his overall haul but one that nevertheless points to his continued strength with young voters. [Here\u2019s the latest data on who\u2019s leading the race to be the Democratic nominee.] And in most polls, Mr. Sanders still maintains a strong lead among young voters: A recent NBC/Wall Street Journal survey showed that a third of voters under 35 supported him. Yet at the same time, a quarter of these respondents said they supported Ms. Warren, suggesting Mr. Sanders no longer has the same hold on the group he had in 2016. Any candidate relying on the support of younger voters faces an undeniable challenge: Younger voters tend not to vote in high numbers compared with other groups. In the 2016 election, for instance, only 11 percent of voters under 30 participated in the Iowa caucuses, representing just 15 percent of the total, according to an estimate from the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts University. But the high turnout among young voters during the 2018 midterm elections has given some experts hope that the 2020 election will be different. That strong showing has provided organizers with a larger pool to identify and target potential presidential voters. Issues, including climate change, criminal justice, health care and gun control, are also motivating young voters to act. \u201cThe truth is that if younger people in this country voted at the same level as people 65 and over, we could transform this country,\u201d Mr. Sanders said this month at the University of Iowa. \u201cPlease do it!\u201d John Della Volpe, the director of polling at Harvard\u2019s Institute of Politics, said that Mr. Sanders was still \u201cdoing really well\u201d but that the field was more complex and his pool of support was smaller. \u201cAt this stage, he\u2019s essentially sharing support of young people in most polls with Elizabeth Warren,\u201d Mr. Della Volpe said. \u201cThe idea of going after structural reforms is really, I think, what is resonating so clearly with young people.\u201d Indeed, of all the other candidates, it is Ms. Warren who appears to be generating the most powerful wave of energy among young voters in Democratic presidential politics \u2014 particularly among those who once supported Mr. Sanders. Olivia Stecklein, 19, a student at the University of Iowa, said she had been a fan of Mr. Sanders since 2015 but was now choosing between him and Ms. Warren. \u201cI feel like they\u2019re pretty similar, but I just kind of like how Elizabeth Warren has a set-out plan for everything,\u201d she said. \u201cShe just seems very prepared.\u201d Eliza Link, 18, a University of Iowa student, said she was also deciding between Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren. \u201cI think they\u2019re both the cool aunt and uncle of the political race right now,\u201d she said. With his characteristic verve that can exhaust even young reporters, Mr. Sanders has been in an all-out sprint to earn the vote of the youths, months before any of them can even cast their vote. His team set up a Bernie Summer School program to train campus leaders in the art of campaigning. He urged his campaign to get him back on college campuses in the first weeks of the new school year. He constantly asks his team to share data on young voters. To win over the group, however, Mr. Sanders will have to convince people like Tim Watts, 19. Before Mr. Sanders\u2019s event in Reno, Mr. Watts wore a \u201cMATH\u201d hat, the universal accessory of Yang supporters. But despite his overt support for Mr. Yang \u2014 who in some ways is benefiting from the outsider status among young voters that Mr. Sanders enjoyed in 2016 \u2014 Mr. Watts said he had not yet closed the door on Mr. Sanders. \u201cI\u2019m part of the Yang gang, I guess,\u201d he said. \u201cI will probably feel the bern later.\u201d",

      "content": " WEBSTER CITY, Iowa \u2014 Iowa\u2019s presidential caucuses disenfranchise huge blocs of voters. The state is 91 percent white. It is not easy to get to, or get around in. But to a greater degree than in recent campaigns, this unrepresentative and idiosyncratic state is proving that it is the only electoral battleground that matters for Democrats from now until caucus night on Feb. 3. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s campaign said it would have 110 staff members in the state by the end of this month. Senator Kamala Harris has promised to visit every week in October. Mayor Pete Buttigieg on Sunday kicked off a John McCain-like, everything-on-the-record bus tour and is advertising on local television and radio. Senator Amy Klobuchar is 49 counties into her tour of all 99 in the state. And on Monday, Senator Bernie Sanders will begin a \u201cBernie Beats Trump\u2019\u2019 tour of eastern Iowa to highlight what he says is his strength as a general election candidate. As a new poll suggested a significant shift in the primary race\u2019s top tier \u2014 with Senator Elizabeth Warren overtaking Mr. Biden for first place \u2014 candidates at the annual Polk County Steak Fry in Des Moines on Saturday tried to cut through the furor surrounding President Trump, Ukraine and Mr. Biden to deliver their message to voters still sifting through their preferences from one of the largest fields in history. The candidates\u2019 renewed sense of urgency has set the stage for a four-month sprint to a night of caucuses that remains the single biggest prize in American politics. \u201cWe know that Iowa is where we can turn heads,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Buttigieg, of South Bend, Ind., said aboard his campaign bus on Sunday. \u201cEven the other early states will be looking at what Iowa did.\u201d The increasing focus on Iowa, where voters must attend an hourslong midwinter evening gathering to participate in choosing their party\u2019s nominee, has come at the expense of New Hampshire, where the nation\u2019s first primary election comes eight days later. None of the Democratic presidential candidates are betting their entire campaigns on a strong performance in New Hampshire, meaning it may be the first time since 1984 that there is not a candidate focused solely on the Granite State in a contested presidential race. With so many candidates running, much remains unsettled. And both Iowa and New Hampshire have a history of lifting underdog candidates, with John Kerry rising from the single digits to a caucus victory in 2004 and Bill Clinton declaring himself the \u201ccomeback kid\u201d when he finished second in New Hampshire\u2019s 1992 primary contest. Yet those examples, like others often cited by this year\u2019s back-of-the-pack candidates, took place before presidential campaigns had become entirely nationalized. Nowadays, Democrats at campaign rallies in rural Iowa are more likely to recite talking points they have heard on cable news or social media than something they read in their local newspaper. Collectively, the 10 Democrats who appeared on the debate stage in Houston this month have spent more than twice as much money on Facebook advertisements targeted to Iowans since June 29 than to people in New Hampshire, Nevada or South Carolina, according to data from Bully Pulpit Interactive, a Democratic political firm. No candidate in the race has a bigger chasm between online investments in the first two nominating states than Ms. Harris, of California, who since June 29 has spent $115,178 on Facebook ads in Iowa, but just $2,164 on such ads in New Hampshire. After some grumbling that she had gone more than a month since last visiting the state, Ms. Harris was overheard last week saying she was \u201cmoving to Iowa,\u201d with an expletive added for emphasis. Her team announced last week that it would add 60 new staff members and open 10 new offices, and she plans to return weekly until Halloween. Her campaign manager told reporters she was aiming for a \u201ctop three\u201d finish in the state. The historically large field has left even the candidates unclear about how many Democrats will have a plausible claim to continue on to New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. Ms. Harris called a third place showing a goal but said she did not know if a failure to meet that threshold would doom her campaign. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t know,\u201d she said in an interview before a campaign stop on Friday in Cedar Falls. \u201cI think it will be a confluence of factors that ultimately decides how long anyone stays in and what that means.\u201d A new poll from The Des Moines Register and CNN, released on Saturday night, showed a reordering of the Democratic field. For the first time in The Register\u2019s poll this year, Ms. Warren, of Massachusetts, at 22 percent support, led Mr. Biden, who the survey found was the first choice of 20 percent of would-be caucusgoers. Mr. Sanders, of Vermont, placed third, at 11 percent, with Mr. Buttigieg at 9 percent and Ms. Harris at 6 percent. \u201cThis is the first major shake-up\u201d of the race, The Register\u2019s pollster, Ann Selzer, told the paper. The poll found that just one in five likely caucusgoers said they had made up their minds, and 63 percent could still be persuaded to shift their support to someone else. Ms. Klobuchar, of Minnesota, who was tied for sixth in the poll, said after presiding over the opening of a new campaign office on Friday in Cedar Rapids that there might be more than twice as many tickets out of Iowa as usual. \u201cYou could be No. 6,\u201d Ms. Klobuchar said before the poll results were announced. \u201cI\u2019m really serious, in a 20-person field and people will go, \u2018Not bad.\u2019 They\u2019re going to look at who is in the top eight.\u201d Mr. Buttigieg predicted a smaller number of candidates would survive Iowa. \u201cI don\u2019t know how many people can emerge, I think that comes down to how many people voters can keep track of,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d be shocked if it\u2019s more than five.\u201d At the moment, all of the Democratic candidates are chasing Ms. Warren. She is drawing the largest crowds in the field \u2014 2,000 came to see her on Thursday night in Iowa City, two hours after and three miles away from a stop by Ms. Harris in Coralville that drew about 200 to a brewery. Ms. Warren declined on Sunday to take a victory lap over her new Iowa polling standing. \u201cI don\u2019t do polls,\u201d she said in Detroit, where she marched with striking autoworkers outside a General Motors plant. \u201cWe are still months away from the Iowa caucuses and the first primary elections.\u201d A cadre of challengers to Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren are augmenting their Iowa operations, adding staff, opening new offices, collecting endorsements and starting new fund-raising appeals as they aim to create the aura of momentum while building organizations to turn out supporters for the state\u2019s Feb. 3 caucuses. Ms. Klobuchar, from neighboring Minnesota, has support from more current and former Iowa state lawmakers than any other 2020 presidential candidate, according to Iowa Starting Line, a local political news website. And Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, who tied with Ms. Klobuchar in The Register\u2019s poll, issued an S.O.S. to supporters over the weekend, saying that without an infusion of $1.7 million by the end of the month his campaign might no longer be viable. While Democrats elsewhere in the country, representing a national party that is increasingly diverse, offer quadrennial grumbling about Iowa, officials here aim to use their status to force the presidential candidates to focus on local issues. J. D. Scholten, a Democrat running for the seat held by Representative Steve King in a 39-county section of northwest Iowa, said he will soon schedule campaign stops across his district with each of the presidential campaigns in towns of 1,000 people or less to test their appeal to rural voters. \u201cI really want to see the engagement,\u201d Mr. Scholten said at the steak fry on Saturday, which drew a crowd of more than 12,000 people. \u201cI think that\u2019s where I\u2019ll see. No polling can tell me, nothing like that. I want to see whether the people\u2019s heads nod or not.\u201d",

      "content": " DETROIT \u2014 The Democratic presidential candidates have been chasing labor support all summer, appearing at small union halls and large conferences, and tweeting support for workers at companies like Amazon and Walmart. But now, as the United Automobile Workers, one of the nation\u2019s largest unions, stages a strike that has even drawn words of support from President Trump, Democrats are seizing the moment to align themselves with workers in public and dramatic ways. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts walked the picket line Sunday alongside striking General Motors workers at an assembly plant in Detroit. Not to be outdone, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. appeared at another G.M. assembly plant in Kansas City, Kan. The picket line visits of two of the leading candidates for the Democratic nomination \u2014 with the third, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, planning to join striking workers in Detroit on Wednesday \u2014 illustrated the importance to Democrats of winning the support of rank-and-file union members, including those who voted for Mr. Trump in 2016. Taking her message of fighting inequality to Michigan for the fourth time since June, Ms. Warren joined a scrum of striking autoworkers, carrying a blue and white \u201cU.A.W. on Strike\u201d sign. As they crisscrossed the entrance to the Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly Plant, where Cadillacs and Chevrolets are built, the workers chanted, \u201cWe are the union, the mighty, mighty union. U.A.W. stand strong.\u201d Ms. Warren criticized G.M. for closing plants while making billions of dollars in profits. \u201cG.M. is demonstrating that it has no loyalty to the workers of America or the people of America,\u201d she said. \u201cTheir only loyalty is to their own bottom line. And if they can save a nickel by moving a job to Mexico or to Asia or to anywhere else on this planet, they will do it.\u201d \u201cEverybody deserves a living wage in this country,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear, unions built America\u2019s middle class and unions will rebuild America\u2019s middle class.\u201d U.A.W. leaders in Detroit voted unanimously a week ago to authorize the strike, the union\u2019s first such walkout since 2007. The union is pushing G.M. to raise wages, reopen some plants and add jobs at others, and narrow the pay gap between new hires and veteran workers. Nearly 50,000 members have joined picket lines at factories across the South and the Midwest. Every major Democratic presidential candidate has expressed support for the striking workers, and several have visited picket lines to appeal to union members who may have switched their support to Mr. Trump. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota joined the one in Detroit on Thursday, while Representative Tim Ryan of Ohio traveled to several in his home state and in Flint, Mich. Addressing the striking U.A.W. workers in Kansas City on Sunday afternoon, Mr. Biden wore a red T-shirt in solidarity. He referenced the bailout of General Motors during the Obama administration, telling the crowd, \u201cWe didn\u2019t bail out GM, U.A.W. bailed out GM!\u201d He went on to lament the high pay of executives at the company and the lack of equitable benefits for workers, and he encouraged the striking workers, acknowledging, \u201cyou\u2019re making a hell of a sacrifice.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s only one reason we have a middle class, and it\u2019s spelled \u2018U-N-I-O-N,\u2019\u201d he said. The crowd cheered. Auto-worker support for the Democratic Party has eroded slightly in recent years, and about 30 percent of the union\u2019s rank and file were estimated to have voted for Mr. Trump in 2016, slightly more than the share who voted for the two previous Republican presidential nominees. The departure of those voters from the Democratic Party, even as the union had officially endorsed Hillary Clinton, was particularly critical to Mr. Trump in Michigan, where he won by the thinnest of margins \u2014 less than 11,000 votes \u2014 to capture the state\u2019s 16 electoral votes. Nearly three years later, it is unclear how many of those union workers continue to back the president. The economy has generally remained strong here, with unemployment near a 20-year low. Representative Debbie Dingell, a Democrat who represents a district just outside of Detroit that is home to several auto manufacturing facilities, said she felt that Mr. Trump\u2019s support among autoworkers had held roughly steady. But she said she believed that a prolonged strike could move the president\u2019s numbers among such workers in one direction or the other, depending on whether they viewed him as trying to help or hurt them. \u201cIf he\u2019s perceived as trying to keep the plants open, and it\u2019s successful, it could have a positive impact,\u201d Ms. Dingell said. In 2016, Ms. Dingell was a lonely voice among Michigan Democrats as she raised concerns that Mr. Trump could carry the state, even going so far as to hold a meeting with Democratic legislators in her district several weeks before the election warning them not to underestimate his appeal. Ms. Dingell said she had heard frequently from autoworkers at dozens of community meetings in 2016 that they were \u201cwith Donald\u201d and that they believed he sincerely cared about trade. Mr. Trump last week expressed hope that the strike would be a \u201cquick one,\u201d complaining about General Motors\u2019 decision to close domestic plants and open factories offshore, and taking a swipe at the company\u2019s leadership, which announced last November that the company would close four plants in the United States. \u201cI got tremendous numbers of votes from the autoworkers,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House. \u201cI don\u2019t want General Motors to be building plants outside of this country. You know they built many plants in China and Mexico and I don\u2019t like that at all.\u201d While Mr. Trump ran as a friend of workers, some labor leaders have said that was largely empty rhetoric. In a recent interview on Fox News, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., Richard Trumka, said workers were suffering, and criticized the White House\u2019s inaction on the minimum wage. During the 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump had said he supported hiking the federal minimum wage, currently at $7.25 an hour, to $10. \u201cHe\u2019s opposed every increase in the minimum wage,\u201d Mr. Trumka said. \u201cHe\u2019s changed the regulation to take overtime away from a couple of million people. He\u2019s proposed trillion-dollar cuts to Medicare and Medicaid. He\u2019s rolled back health and safety standards toward workers.\u201d As a crowd of about 200 waited for Ms. Warren\u2019s arrival on a sunny day, blocking the entrance to the idled plant, some sang along to a recording of Aretha Franklin\u2019s \u201cRespect,\u201d the message directed at G.M. management. Many wore red T-shirts that said \u201cSolidarity, No More Bull.\u201d In many ways, Ms. Warren\u2019s central message, which emphasizes the struggles of middle- and low-income Americans, appeals to the same frustrations that Mr. Trump tapped into in 2016 \u2014 pent-up anger at an economy and system that workers view as unfair. \u201cPersonally for me, this is a lot bigger than G.M. and the autoworkers,\u201d said Mike Mucci, a worker who was on the picket line outside the Detroit plant on Sunday. \u201cThis is a fight for the middle class.\u201d Mr. Mucci, 43, who said he was not a fan of Mr. Trump, predicted that the president would \u201cdo anything he could to try to take credit for saving the U.A.W.\u201d Robert Hatline, 61, a retired G.M. worker who voted for Mrs. Clinton in 2016, said he was impressed with Ms. Warren\u2019s plan to provide free public college. \u201cI like what she says if she can do it,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to see student loans reduced off these kids.\u201d Carla Duckett, 60, a team leader on the Cadillac line here, said she would support whichever Democrat the U.A.W. endorsed. \u201cI just know we\u2019ve got to support the Democrats this time,\u201d she said. Ms. Klobuchar, who delivered doughnuts when she visited the picket line on Thursday, described how G.M. workers had suffered during the economic downturn and how the company had \u201cbounced back.\u201d \u201cThis particular company has been making a lot of money and that means to me that you got to share it with your workers,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that means better wages, that means health care, and that also means the long-term benefits that our workers deserve. That\u2019s what this is about. It\u2019s about shared prosperity, that we\u2019re all in it together.\u201d Mr. Sanders\u2019s Wednesday visit will follow a stop on Tuesday at a labor rally in support of the Chicago Teachers Union. In August, Mr. Sanders released his Workplace Democracy Plan, which he has said would double union membership during his term and give workers increased workplace protection. Mr. Ryan, who cited the closing of the Chevrolet Cruz plant in Lordstown earlier this year as the impetus for his presidential campaign, joined G.M. workers outside the idled plant last Monday. \u201cWhen a group of workers lose their jobs, it causes massive disruption in the whole community,\u201d Mr. Ryan tweeted. \u201cKids of these workers have to deal w/ either move to a new state & school; or the trauma of a parent being laid off. Educators are often left to help pick up the pieces.\u201d G.M. last year announced its plans to close the four plants, including the one in Lordstown, with hundreds of workers electing to relocate to other G.M. facilities. The Hamtramck plant, which makes the Chevrolet Impala and the Cadillac CT6, is slated to shut down in January. The idled plants have become an issue in the negotiations, with workers also pushing G.M. to improve wages, add jobs at other facilities, pay a greater share of employee health care costs, and close or narrow the difference between pay rates for new hires and veteran workers. Pointing to a $50 billion federal bailout of G.M. in 2009 following the financial crisis, as well as union concessions, many G.M. workers have said they view the decisions as particularly callous. The company paid the government back most of the money. The Democratic presidential candidates have joined picket lines in previous strikes, including the McDonald\u2019s strike in May and the Stop & Shop strike in April, as they jockey for union endorsements. But with a couple of isolated exceptions \u2014 the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America endorsed Mr. Sanders last month, and the national firefighters\u2019 union endorsed former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. in April \u2014 unions have been holding back, many waiting until they see which Democratic candidate wins the support of the rank and file.",

      "content": "  He tends to meander and misspeak. She once won a college debate scholarship. He is a relative centrist who is seen by Democrats in early polls as the strongest candidate against President Trump. She is a self-styled progressive fighter whose ability to appeal to the broad electorate in a general election still worries some voters and party officials. He rarely delves deep into policy on the campaign trail, preferring to discuss American values and the dangers of a second Trump administration. She gleefully ticks through her long list of detailed plans. In style, substance and strategies for winning the White House, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Elizabeth Warren present two starkly different options for Democratic voters, and in many ways they embody competing theories about what the Democratic Party should stand for. Those tensions will be laid bare Thursday night in Houston, when the two candidates meet onstage at a debate for the first time in the presidential race. It\u2019s a highly anticipated matchup between the early front-runner, Mr. Biden, and a liberal standard-bearer, Ms. Warren, who has steadily climbed in the polls to challenge him. Mr. Biden is eager to stress his experience. And his advisers and allies suggested in interviews that, whether obliquely or overtly, he is prepared to seize on one of Ms. Warren\u2019s perceived strengths \u2014 her extensive and boldly progressive policy plans \u2014 and use that to accentuate his own record of liberal achievements despite the sometimes-challenging political realities in Washington. \u201cYou have to have plans, but you have to be able to execute those plans,\u201d he said at a fund-raiser last week in Manhattan, a message he is expected to reiterate. Ms. Warren is unlikely to pursue the kind of personal, premeditated broadside that Senator Kamala Harris launched against Mr. Biden in the first debate. But she has emerged onstage as a skilled advocate for her message of \u201cbig, structural change\u201d and has shown that she is capable of crisply defending her far-reaching proposals. \u201cWe start with a plan, and then we get out there and fight for it,\u201d she told reporters in Austin, Tex., on Tuesday when she was asked about Mr. Biden\u2019s focus on what progressive proposals are achievable. \u201cTo me, that\u2019s what being president is all about. It\u2019s about laying those plans out and showing the direction for this country, and then getting in the fight, leading the fight and bringing people along.\u201d At Thursday\u2019s debate, Ms. Warren will have another opportunity to stress the urgency of fixing what she views as an economic and political system that caters to the rich and powerful at the expense of working people. Mr. Biden, a Beltway veteran, is expected to preach pragmatism, with a focus on how to achieve Democratic priorities in a divided political moment. [Which Democrats are leading the 2020 presidential race this week?] One risk for Mr. Biden is that, while he connects well with voters in one-on-one interactions, he is prone to uneven and sometimes faltering performances onstage. And the debate arrives as he has faced scrutiny for a series of gaffes and misstatements. \u201cVice President Biden has not proven to be really great on his feet,\u201d said Steve Drahozal, chairman of the Dubuque County Democratic Party in Iowa. \u201cI know he does not think that his gaffes are a big deal, but he is going up against a very keen, intelligent, articulate candidate who is able to frame issues very well.\u201d A strong night for Ms. Warren could further propel her already-accelerating campaign both nationally and especially in Iowa, the state that begins the presidential primary process, where Mr. Biden already faces challenges. \u201cShe\u2019s been the one who\u2019s been gaining the most,\u201d Mr. Drahozal said. \u201cWith Biden being in the front-runner position, I don\u2019t think he has a lot to gain. He has a lot to lose.\u201d Mr. Biden\u2019s team has no illusions about Ms. Warren\u2019s skill as a debater and her rise in the polls, advisers and others close to the campaign acknowledge, though they insist that they are not focusing on her alone. Mr. Biden spent the first two debates facing intense criticism from his opponents, a reflection in part of his current standing atop the polls, and his campaign is bracing for more broadsides from all across the stage. Allies noted that Mr. Biden has survived rough debate performances before, with little lasting impact on his national poll numbers. That, they argue, is evidence of the deep-seated good will that Mr. Biden, President Barack Obama\u2019s vice president, continues to enjoy from the Democratic base. [Sign up for our politics newsletter and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race.] They also see several opportunities for him to draw contrasts that could work to his benefit. That list includes emphasizing his foreign policy credentials \u2014 as a former vice president and a former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \u2014 amid several prominent foreign policy-related controversies involving the Trump administration. His team is convinced that the Democratic electorate is far more moderate than some activists suggest, and welcomes a debate over issues like health care \u2014 Mr. Biden supports a public option but opposes eliminating private insurance, something Ms. Warren supports under \u201cMedicare for all\u201d \u2014 and which social programs should be offered for free. And allies are eager to deepen an argument Mr. Biden has been previewing: that it is not enough to have ambitious plans if those proposals cannot survive the political realities of Washington. \u201cLots of other candidates have great plans, they have good policy papers, many of them have, you know, talked about them on college campuses or in the Senate,\u201d said Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware. \u201cThe difference, I think, is that Joe has decades of actual experience getting things enacted in a bitterly divided and partisan Washington, and I think he can and should point to that.\u201d Ms. Warren did not face significant scrutiny from other leading contenders in the first two debates. Mr. Biden\u2019s allies are privately hopeful that she will be pressed on the details and practicalities of her proposals by several of the candidates onstage, as her formidable standing in the race now makes her a bigger target for attacks. Ms. Warren and Mr. Biden have clashed before, exchanging sharp words during a fight over the nation\u2019s bankruptcy laws, which culminated in the passage of a bill in 2005 that Mr. Biden supported and Ms. Warren opposed. In April, in response to a reporter\u2019s question on the day Mr. Biden entered the race, Ms. Warren took a swipe at him over the bankruptcy legislation they had disagreed about. But she has almost always refrained from overtly criticizing her rivals, and any kind of premeditated attack on Mr. Biden on the debate stage would be a significant departure from how Ms. Warren has approached the campaign so far. \u201cDifferent candidates have different imperatives in the debates, and there are some candidates that need to throw wild punches in order to get attention,\u201d said Adam Green, a founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which is backing Ms. Warren. \u201cFortunately, Elizabeth Warren is not in that camp.\u201d Still, Mr. Green said, \u201cJust because she doesn\u2019t throw a punch doesn\u2019t mean that she doesn\u2019t strongly show a contrast.\u201d Scott M. Stringer, the New York City comptroller, who endorsed Ms. Warren on Monday, said there was no need for Ms. Warren to confront Mr. Biden on the debate stage. \u201cI think she has to challenge the Democratic Party and say, we can be incremental or we can be big and bold,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if she can showcase big and bold, I don\u2019t think she has to look at Joe Biden. I think she has to look directly into the camera and speak to the American people and Democrats.\u201d Speaking to reporters on Saturday at the New Hampshire Democratic Party convention, Ms. Warren portrayed the debate as an opportunity to share her message with a large audience. She received a far more raucous reception at the convention than did Mr. Biden, who was the first presidential candidate to speak. But asked to compare her welcome to Mr. Biden\u2019s, she did not engage. \u201cAll I can do is stand up and talk about why I\u2019m running,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not here to criticize any other Democrat or anyone else\u2019s campaign.\u201d Still, veteran Democrats caution that for all of the momentum she has enjoyed lately, Ms. Warren still has work to do in assuaging concerns about whether her unapologetically progressive candidacy would resonate in general election battlegrounds. \u201cElizabeth probably needs to show that she is ready to take on Middle America, the center of our country,\u201d said Sylvia Larsen, the former New Hampshire Senate president, who also questioned whether Mr. Biden could excite younger voters. \u201cOur primaries push people into a more left position and so to get back to a center \u2014 Joe already holds the center. And so, can Elizabeth Warren move back to the center if she\u2019s our nominee?\u201d Ms. Warren, for her part, has challenged the idea that a more moderate candidate is best positioned to win. At the convention Saturday, she told the crowd that \u201cwe can\u2019t choose a candidate we don\u2019t believe in because we\u2019re scared.\u201d And at a house party in New Hampshire on Labor Day, she cautioned against \u201cnibbling around the edges\u201d \u2014 without mentioning Mr. Biden by name. \u201cI think what\u2019s going to carry us as Democrats is not playing it safe,\u201d she said.",

      "author": "Alan Rappeport",
      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts unveiled a plan on Thursday to give all recipients of Social Security benefits an extra $200 per month and to pay for it by raising taxes on the rich, her latest economic proposal to redistribute wealth in the United States. Ms. Warren, whose support has been rising steadily in polling of the Democratic presidential race, announced the plan ahead of a Democratic primary debate on Thursday evening. The proposal appeared to be targeted directly at older voters who have been gravitating toward former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who thus far is the front-runner in the primary campaign. \u201cIt\u2019s time Washington stopped trying to slash Social Security benefits for people who\u2019ve earned them,\u201d Ms. Warren wrote in a post on Medium. \u201cIt\u2019s time to expand Social Security.\u201d Ms. Warren\u2019s proposal would significantly increase government spending on Social Security, which is already the single largest federal program, accounting for about a quarter of the budget. The largest portion of her plan, raising benefits for 64 million recipients by $200 a month, would cost more than $150 billion in its first year. The plan would also fundamentally alter the funding structure of the program, forcing the very rich to pay much more into Social Security in taxes than they would get out of it in benefits, while most Americans would get far more than they pay in. Ms. Warren\u2019s proposal is the latest sign that Democrats have shifted from promising to protect Social Security benefits \u2014 or in the case of former President Barack Obama, proposing to slow the rate at which benefits increase over time \u2014 to expanding the program and increasing benefits. House Democrats are considering a vote on a bill that would increase benefits and shore up the program\u2019s future finances by raising the taxes that fund the program, for middle- and high-income workers. Social Security is popular with voters, but polls show they worry about its solvency. Attempts to change the program and reduce benefits have long been considered a \u201cthird rail\u201d of American politics. Earlier this year, a government report found that the cost of Social Security would exceed its income in 2020 for the first time since 1982. The program\u2019s reserve fund is projected to be depleted in 16 years, at which time recipients would get smaller payments than they are scheduled to receive, if Congress does not act. Older Americans, who would see the most immediate benefits from Ms. Warren\u2019s proposal, represent a sizable voting block in the Democratic primary race. In 2016, nearly three in 10 Democratic caucusgoers in Iowa were 65 and older, according to polls of voters entering the caucuses. In a national poll released by CNN on Wednesday, Mr. Biden was supported by 35 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents who were 65 or older. Ms. Warren was next at 22 percent. No other Democratic candidate exceeded 5 percent. Mr. Biden has proposed increasing Social Security benefits for older Americans, as part of a plan to shore up the program. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont introduced legislation in February to tax workers earning above $250,000 a year, in order to extend the solvency of the program by more than 50 years. Social Security recipients get an average of $16,248 a year in benefits, and Ms. Warren is proposing to give them a raise of $2,400 a year. The plan would also overhaul how annual cost-of-living increases are calculated so that benefits increase more rapidly over time. And it would create a new Social Security credit for people who leave the work force to care for family members \u2014 a benefit that Ms. Warren says would make the social safety net program more fair for women. Like many of Ms. Warren\u2019s major policy proposals, the plan to broaden Social Security has a particular source of financing: the rich. Under the plan, Ms. Warren would impose a new 14.8 percent payroll tax on individuals who earn more than $250,000 a year, to be split by workers and their employers, and a 14.8 percent tax on investment income that would apply to the top 2 percent of earners. The Warren campaign, citing an analysis conducted by Moody\u2019s Analytics, estimated that the plan would reduce the federal budget deficit by $1.1 trillion over a decade. It would accomplish that with a $4.2 trillion tax increase over that period. Ms. Warren\u2019s plan to accelerate the cost-of-living increases for Social Security benefits represents a stark shift from a proposal offered by Mr. Obama in 2013 that would have slowed the rate at which benefits increase over time by switching to a different measure of inflation known as the \u201cchained\u201d Consumer Price Index. That idea, which was floated in an effort to reach a budget agreement with Republicans, was ultimately scrapped. President Trump vowed as a candidate not to cut Social Security and initially steered clear of addressing the program\u2019s looming shortfall. However, in the budget proposal that the White House released in March, Mr. Trump called for a $26 billion reduction in spending on Social Security programs, including a $10 billion cut to the Social Security Disability Insurance program, which provides benefits to disabled workers. Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, who reviewed Ms. Warren\u2019s proposal for the campaign, said that it would extend the solvency of Social Security by almost 20 years. In his analysis, Mr. Zandi noted that Ms. Warren\u2019s fondness for funding new spending by taxing the rich could affect the economy significantly. Ms. Warren, he wrote, \u201chas put forth a number of other economic policy plans, including for affordable housing, student lending, clean energy and child care, that are also financed in large part by substantially greater taxes on high-income and high net worth households.\u201d \u201cGiven this financial burden,\u201d he added, \u201cthere could be significant behavioral changes by these households that are difficult to gauge.\u201d The Trump administration panned Ms. Warren\u2019s proposal on Thursday. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, speaking to reporters outside the White House, said, \u201cIf you listen to the Elizabeth Warren plan, it\u2019s 100 percent recession, if not worse.\u201d",

      "content": "  DES MOINES \u2014 Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts is the new Iowa polling leader, narrowly in first place ahead of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., according to a new poll of the state from The Des Moines Register and CNN. The poll showed that Ms. Warren was the first choice for 22 percent of would-be Democratic caucusgoers, a significant increase from the 15 percent support she held in June, when The Register last polled the state. Mr. Biden dropped from a first-place June showing of 24 percent to 20 percent. The result left the two in a statistical tie, well ahead of the rest of the pack. The poll is the latest evidence of Ms. Warren\u2019s political rise in the 2020 race. Alone among the 2020 candidates, her campaign stops have become bona fide events, with 20,000 people attending a speech in Manhattan this week and 2,000 turning out in Iowa City on Thursday night. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont placed third with 11 percent, the second consecutive poll from The Register in which his campaign has seen precipitous decreases in support. Mr. Sanders, who placed in a statistical tie with Hillary Clinton in the state\u2019s 2016 contest, had 25 percent support in the paper\u2019s March poll and 16 percent support in June. Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., placed fourth in The Register\u2019s poll, with 9 percent. He had 14 percent in The Register\u2019s June poll and has fallen in other surveys of the state since then before launching a television advertising campaign here after Labor Day. The gains by Ms. Warren come largely at the expense of Mr. Sanders. His polling drop-off comes as his campaign has reordered staff in early nominating states in an effort to reboot his campaign. Senator Kamala Harris of California was fifth overall with 6 percent support. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota each had 3 percent support. Four candidates were the first choice of 2 percent of likely Iowa caucusgoers. In addition to leading the field, Ms. Warren also has the most room for growth in the field \u2014 71 percent of Democrats surveyed said she was their first or second choice or they were open to backing her, the poll found. Mr. Biden was next, being considered by 60 percent of Iowa Democrats. Of the rest of the field, only Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Harris were being considered by more than half the Democratic electorate. The dynamics are far from set: Just one in five likely Democratic caucusgoers said their minds were made up, and 63 percent said they could still be persuaded to support a different candidate. The poll surveyed 602 likely Democratic caucusgoers by telephone Sept. 14-18, and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points. It was released after 17 Democratic presidential candidates appeared Saturday at the Polk County Steak Fry, an annual political event that drew 12,000 activists and voters to a Des Moines park for several hours of political speeches, campaign singalongs and freshly grilled meats. The poll, like the Steak Fry event, illustrated the increasingly condensed nature of the 2020 Democratic presidential contest. The poll found just five candidates registering more than 3 percent support, while those who braved the drizzling conditions and threat of thunderstorms congregated around the candidates who emerged hours later atop the polls. The event\u2019s largest applause came for Ms. Warren, who repeated a forceful call for President Trump\u2019s impeachment, and Mr. Buttigieg, who was followed by a yellow-clad cadre of highly enthusiastic supporters. Mr. Biden, whose campaign purchased the largest allotment of Steak Fry tickets, entered the event with a marching band and scores of campaign aides and volunteers. The lower-polling contenders for the most part roamed the grounds of Water Works Park here unencumbered. Mr. Biden was not the only candidate bringing some flash to the event. Supporters of the former housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro danced to a mariachi band, backers of former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke pushed a boat out into the nearby lake, Ms. Warren took 1,050 selfies and Ms. Klobuchar blasted the music of Prince, a Minnesota hero. For some, the event may mark one of their last major appearances in the state. Mr. Booker sent out a plea to donors today saying that unless he raises $1.7 million over the next 10 days, he will be unable to remain in the race. He\u2019s not alone in being in danger of running out of cash.",

His proposal goes further in who would be taxed and how much money would be raised.By Thomas KaplanPRINT EDITIONA Candidate Opposed to Billionaires Unveils His Tax Proposal|September 25, 2019, Page A13",
      "author": "Thomas Kaplan",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Senator Bernie Sanders on Tuesday unveiled a proposal to create a new tax on the wealth of the richest Americans, including a steep tax on billionaires that could greatly diminish their fortunes. With the proposal, Mr. Sanders is embracing an idea that has been a centerpiece of the campaign of his top progressive rival, Senator Elizabeth Warren. But while Ms. Warren came first, Mr. Sanders is going bigger. His wealth tax would apply to a larger number of households, impose a higher top rate and raise more money. Mr. Sanders\u2019s plan to tax accumulated wealth, not just income, is particularly aggressive in how it would erode the fortunes of billionaires. His tax would cut in half the wealth of the typical billionaire after 15 years, according to two economists who worked with the Sanders campaign on the plan. Mr. Sanders would use the money generated by his wealth tax to fund the housing plan he released last week and a forthcoming plan for universal child care, as well as to help pay for \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d \u201cLet me be very clear: As president of the United States, I will reduce the outrageous and grotesque and immoral level of income and wealth inequality,\u201d Mr. Sanders said in an interview. \u201cWhat we are trying to do is demand and implement a policy which significantly reduces income and wealth inequality in America by telling the wealthiest families in this country they cannot have so much wealth.\u201d Asked if he thought billionaires should exist in the United States, Mr. Sanders said, \u201cI hope the day comes when they don\u2019t.\u201d He added, \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be tomorrow.\u201d [Sign up for our politics newsletter and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race.] \u201cI don\u2019t think that billionaires should exist,\u201d he said, adding that there would always be rich people and others with less money. \u201cThis proposal does not eliminate billionaires, but it eliminates a lot of the wealth that billionaires have, and I think that\u2019s exactly what we should be doing.\u201d The proposal from Mr. Sanders is the latest sign of the push in the Democratic Party to collect substantially more revenue from the wealthiest Americans by rethinking how they are taxed \u2014 a move that could provide large sums of money to finance new social programs. And it is a significant development in the competition of ideas between Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren, the two leading progressive candidates in the Democratic primary race. Both of their plans would need to be passed by Congress in order to take effect \u2014 a virtual impossibility unless Democrats win control of the Senate in the 2020 elections, and far from a sure thing even then. Ms. Warren\u2019s plan touched off a number of questions about the feasibility of creating a wealth tax, including whether such a tax would be constitutional, how it would be enforced and whether it would generate as much money as has been projected. On Tuesday, Ms. Warren welcomed Mr. Sanders\u2019s plan. \u201cI\u2019m delighted to see people talking about a wealth tax,\u201d she told WBUR. \u201cI think it\u2019s great because this is how we make big structural change in this economy. We need all of the presidential candidates talking about it; where are the rest of them?\u201d Mr. Sanders, of Vermont, would create an annual tax that would apply to households with a net worth above $32 million \u2014 about 180,000 households in total, or about the top 0.1 percent, according to the economists who worked on the plan. He would impose a 1 percent tax on net worth above $32 million, with increasing marginal rates topping out at 8 percent on net worth over $10 billion. For single filers, the brackets would be halved, meaning the tax would kick in at $16 million. By contrast, the wealth tax proposed by Ms. Warren, of Massachusetts, would apply to households with a net worth above $50 million \u2014 an estimated 70,000 households in total. The structure of her plan is simpler: She would apply a 2 percent tax on net worth from $50 million to $1 billion, and a 3 percent tax on net worth above $1 billion. Unlike the Sanders plan, the tax brackets would be the same for married and single filers. Mr. Sanders\u2019s tax is projected to raise $4.35 trillion over a decade, while Ms. Warren\u2019s is projected to raise $2.6 trillion over the same time period. Those estimates were produced by Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, two economists at the University of California, Berkeley, with whom both the Sanders and Warren campaigns consulted as they developed their proposals. (The projection for Ms. Warren\u2019s plan differs slightly from their original estimate of $2.75 trillion earlier this year.) \u201cThe Sanders plan is really pitched at the idea that we don\u2019t want billionaires and decabillionaires to be billionaires and decabillionaires for as long as they currently are,\u201d Mr. Saez said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to erode their fortunes much faster than the Warren wealth tax.\u201d Mr. Sanders included several steps in his plan to enforce the tax, including creating a \u201cnational wealth registry,\u201d increasing funding for the Internal Revenue Service and requiring audits of many taxpayers who are subject to the wealth tax, including all billionaires. Mr. Saez and Mr. Zucman calculated how the Warren and Sanders wealth taxes would have affected the fortunes of the richest Americans had each been in effect since 1982. The fortune of Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder who Forbes said was worth $160 billion last year, would have been $87 billion under the Warren plan and $43 billion under the Sanders plan. Over all, the economists found, the cumulative wealth of the top 15 richest Americans in 2018 \u2014 amounting to $943 billion, using estimates from Forbes \u2014 would have been $434 billion under the Warren plan and $196 billion under the Sanders plan. Mr. Sanders is hardly a newcomer to the idea of a wealth tax. In a 1997 book, he wrote that it was \u201ctime, high time, to establish a tax on wealth similar to those that exist in most European countries.\u201d In 2017, he included a wealth tax on a list of financing options for Medicare for all. Ms. Warren was quick to harness the idea in the 2020 race. She released her wealth tax proposal in January, weeks before Mr. Sanders began his campaign. Since then, the proposal has become a cornerstone of Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign and a fixture of her stump speech, even prompting chants of \u201cTwo cents!\u201d from crowds. The money from her tax would go toward other policy plans she has issued, including her proposals for universal child care, student debt cancellation and tuition-free public college.",

      "author": "Shane Goldmacher",
      "content": " The breathless text message from President Trump and his campaign landed soon after Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry: \u201cI need you on my Impeachment Defense Team.\u201d Within three hours of Ms. Pelosi\u2019s announcement on Tuesday, Mr. Trump had raised $1 million, and his campaign manager said on Wednesday that Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and the Republican National Committee had raised $5 million in 24 hours. \u201cHuge groundswell of support,\u201d wrote Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign manager, on Twitter. The impeachment fight between the Democratic-led House of Representatives and the Trump White House may have initiated a constitutional clash, but for the political operatives involved in the 2020 campaign it also represents a potentially galvanizing moment to pry loose wallets. In a flurry of tweets, text messages and emails, Mr. Trump has pressed his millions of supporters to donate to protect his hold on the presidency. At times, the Trump campaign almost seemed to mock the allegations that he improperly sought assistance from a foreign nation against a political rival, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., in a call with the president of Ukraine. One email from Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and the Republican National Committee arrived with the paper clip symbol and the words \u201cCall Transcript\u201d in the subject line, suggesting there was an attachment. There was no attachment. Instead, Mr. Trump was seeking \u201ccharter members\u201d for his \u201cOfficial Impeachment Defense Task Force\u201d against a Democratic \u201csmear job.\u201d At least initially, most Democrats were less explicit than Mr. Trump in seeking to monetize the impeachment push, with several emailing their lists of supporters to first ask them to sign impeachment petitions, rather than asking directly for donations. But money still flowed: The online ticker for ActBlue, the company that processes most online Democratic donations, showed that Tuesday was one of the bigger fund-raising days in recent months that was not linked to a Democratic debate or a monthly deadline. The site showed $4.6 million in donations on Tuesday, after $4.2 million on Monday. All the 2020 Democratic presidential campaigns use ActBlue, as do most Democratic House and Senate candidates. The Democratic National Committee said a text message it sent out on Tuesday evening raised more money than any of its previous texting efforts. \u201cURGENT: Stand with Speaker Pelosi as the House moves forward with an official impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump,\u201d the message read. The D.N.C. also said that Tuesday was its best fund-raising day of the month. (Notably, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the campaign arm for House Democrats, has so far not included impeachment in its fund-raising solicitations.) Mr. Biden finds himself in a particularly unusual situation. Following the revelation that Mr. Trump pressured the president of Ukraine to investigate unsubstantiated corruption allegations about Mr. Biden and his son, Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign has pushed supporters to stand with him \u2014 financially. \u201cDisgusting,\u201d read one email subject line. \u201cAbout Ukraine,\u201d said another. \u201cDonald Trump asked a foreign leader eight times to investigate my family,\u201d one appeal read. \u201cBut I\u2019m only going to ask you once: Please, I need you with me at this critical moment. Chip in to my campaign tonight.\u201d A Biden adviser said the campaign had tripled its daily online fund-raising average on Saturday, though the adviser didn\u2019t respond Wednesday morning when asked whether that pace had continued. The campaign also sent a fund-raising email Tuesday evening suggesting that Mr. Biden\u2019s sliding poll numbers were a bigger problem than Mr. Trump\u2019s foreign dealings. \u201cLook, here\u2019s the bad news: Trump is using the Oval Office to pressure a foreign power into interfering in the 2020 election,\u201d the email said. \u201cAnd it gets even worse: A new poll has us down in Iowa, a key first state in this Primary race.\u201d The release on Wednesday of a reconstructed transcript of the call between Mr. Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine could add further fund-raising fodder. \u201cBREAKING: Trump memo bombshell,\u201d read an email from the campaign of Senator Kamala Harris of California. Inside, the campaign urged supporters to \u201crush a contribution to Kamala\u2019s presidential campaign to elect a president who will fight for truth, justice and the rule of law \u2014 and defeat the lawless one we have now.\u201d Ms. Harris was also running an ad on Facebook targeting Iowa voters, in which she called for impeachment proceedings in a video. The campaign of Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who saw a fund-raising bump when she called for impeachment in April, is using the issue to try to expand its email list, running Facebook ads on the subject. \u201cThe impeachment inquiry must move forward with the efficiency and seriousness this crisis demands,\u201d Ms. Warren says in an ad that began running on Tuesday. \u201cThe House needs to vote on articles of impeachment \u2014 and when it comes to the Senate, I will do what the Constitution requires. Sign up now if you\u2019re with me.\u201d Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign has been spending modestly on impeachment-related Facebook ads for months, according to Bully Pulpit Interactive, a Democratic digital communications firm. From late April to mid-September, her campaign spent an estimated $133,000 on Facebook ads about impeachment, according to the firm. But that represented only about 8 percent of her overall spending on Facebook during that period.",

      "content": "  KEENE, N.H. \u2014 Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s message on impeachment was blunt and brief. On a college campus here, Ms. Warren reminded a crowd of hundreds that she had called for President Trump\u2019s impeachment last spring, after the release of Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s report on Russian interference in the 2016 election. Taking action against Mr. Trump, she said then, was \u201ca matter of constitutional responsibility.\u201d \u201cIf Congress does not hold this man accountable, then he will break the law again and again and again,\u201d Ms. Warren said Wednesday. \u201cIt is time for impeachment now.\u201d She said she was pleased the House of Representatives had \u201cstepped up\u201d and expressed hope the process would move \u201cquickly.\u201d And then, less than three minutes after she began speaking, Ms. Warren turned away from the subject. Ms. Warren was not the only Democrat on Wednesday to attempt such a balancing act, as other candidates blended urgent denunciations of Mr. Trump with broader arguments for their own campaigns. Across the Democratic field, candidates are approaching the impeachment battle stirring in Washington as a matter to be addressed but also contained \u2014 a necessary process, but perhaps not one that ought to redefine their own campaigns. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont released a statement labeling Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cself-dealing and corruption\u201d as \u201climitless,\u201d and praising the House for formally opening an impeachment inquiry. But he also tweeted about homelessness and outsourced jobs after walking on a picket line in Michigan. Senator Kamala Harris of California said in interview that she was shocked by the summary of a phone call the president made to the leader of Ukraine in which he urged his counterpart to investigate one of his political rivals, Joseph R. Biden Jr. But she also said her candidacy would remain focused on the scope of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency and not a single episode or the impeachment question narrowly. And Mr. Biden, who held no public events on Wednesday, issued his own statement saying he would be focused \u201cnot on how Donald Trump abused his power to come after my family, but on how he has turned his back on America\u2019s families.\u201d Candidates like Ms. Warren may have the stature to communicate with voters over the din of impeachment. She has risen rapidly in the polls in recent weeks, threatening to overtake Mr. Biden as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination. Ms. Warren was the first of the major Democratic candidates to demand Mr. Trump\u2019s impeachment, but mentions Mr. Trump sparingly in her speeches. Even she is declining to transform her campaign into a crusade for his ouster. Democratic voters, too, appear not to be focused with singular intensity on impeachment: Ms. Warren\u2019s rhetoric on the matter drew loud applause, but no louder than the crowd\u2019s reaction to her arguments about climate change, racial inequality and government corruption. Among the people in Ms. Warren\u2019s audience, there was a sense of outrage about Mr. Trump\u2019s conduct and a sense of support for the steps taken this week by House Democrats to investigate him more aggressively. But there was little optimism that Mr. Trump might ultimately be removed from office, and some expressed anxiety at the unpredictability of the impeachment process. Tim Butterworth, a retired teacher who is supporting Ms. Warren, said he believed the House had a duty to proceed with impeachment even though there was \u201ckind of a stone wall\u201d waiting in the Republican-controlled Senate. Mr. Butterworth did not mention Ms. Warren\u2019s support for impeachment among his reasons for supporting her, focusing instead on her plans for addressing economic inequality. \u201cI think it would be easier to defeat him in an election,\u201d Mr. Butterworth, 75, said of the president. \u201cBut when you see a crime being committed, you have to report it. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019re complicit.\u201d Ellen Moran, an undecided voter who works in urgent care, expressed both exasperation with Mr. Trump and some trepidation about impeachment. Ms. Moran, who is deciding between Ms. Warren and Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., said it was \u201cembarrassing, frankly, as an American that we have to come down to this.\u201d Earlier in the day, Ms. Warren was one of at least two candidates, along with the former housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, who labeled the reconstruction of the phone call a \u201csmoking gun.\u201d The call between Mr. Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine is at the center of accusations that Mr. Trump pressured a foreign leader to open a potential corruption investigation tied to Mr. Biden, who is seeking to challenge Mr. Trump in 2020. The news of the call \u2014 which was first revealed by a whistle-blower who works in the intelligence community \u2014 prompted House Democrats to say on Tuesday they would formally open an impeachment inquiry. The rapid developments in Washington provided a rare chance for most of the 19 Democratic candidates to offer a unified response in a primary that has increasingly seen them draw distinctions with each other in an attempt to stand out. The near-uniform embrace of an impeachment inquiry represents a significant shift from this spring, after the release of the report by the special counsel, Mr. Mueller, on Russian interference in the 2016 election, when fewer candidates explicitly endorsed beginning an impeachment inquiry. Poll after poll has shown that Democratic voters\u2019 top priority is beating Mr. Trump in the 2020 general election, and the allegations that he pressured a foreign leader in an effort to hurt a political rival have enabled the candidates to collectively paint him as unfit to occupy the presidency. In the interview, Ms. Harris said the time for impeachment had come. \u201cThis guy has told us who he is,\u201d she said. \u201cHe believes he\u2019s above the law. And everything that has happened in these years continues to tell us that.\u201d Her campaign on Wednesday also highlighted the role of Attorney General William P. Barr in the various controversies surrounding Mr. Trump. Ms. Harris\u2019s communications director resurfaced an exchange between Ms. Harris and Mr. Barr during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in May about Mr. Mueller\u2019s report, in which she asked the attorney general whether Mr. Trump had ever asked him to open an investigation into anyone else. After much hesitation, Mr. Barr said he did not know. In the interview, Ms. Harris, a former prosecutor who ran California\u2019s Department of Justice, raised concerns about the fact that Mr. Trump had urged Mr. Zelensky to contact Mr. Barr about opening an investigation. \u201cIs he using his power in a way that\u2019s for political advantage rather than the pursuit of justice?\u201d Ms. Harris asked. \u201cYes, I have a question about where is this attorney general\u2019s loyalty, and to whom, and to what end.\u201d Not every candidate in the Democratic primary supports an impeachment inquiry. Representative Tulsi Gabbard, who has long opposed that remedy, argued Tuesday on Fox News that \u201cimpeachment at this juncture would be terribly divisive for the country.\u201d And on Wednesday, she said that seeing the reconstructed transcript had not changed her mind. \u201cMost people reading through that transcript are not going to find that extremely compelling cause to throw out a president,\u201d she said. Most of the rest of the Democratic candidates however were unequivocal in their calls for an impeachment investigation to begin. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey said that the memo on the phone call was \u201capparent proof that Trump had pressured a foreign nation to meddle in our democracy again.\u201d \u201cHistory will remember those who put politics aside at this time of crisis and treated it like the moral moment that it is,\u201d he said. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota said that the record of the call was \u201cdeeply disturbing,\u201d adding that Mr. Trump had \u201cviolated the public\u2019s trust.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s shameful,\u201d she said. \u201cOur country deserves better.\u201d And Mr. Castro, in an interview, called Mr. Trump\u2019s conduct \u201cegregious.\u201d \u201cI want to see Donald Trump held accountable and for the House to move forward with impeachment,\u201d he said.",

      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 Oddly, it has been business as usual on the campaign trail this week. Senator Elizabeth Warren explained her policy plans to voters in New Hampshire on Wednesday, Senator Bernie Sanders walked a picket line with striking auto workers in Detroit and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. courted donors in Bel Air, Calif., and went on Jimmy Kimmel\u2019s late-night TV show. But behind the scenes, many of the 2020 Democratic candidates have been grappling with a new reality: For the first time, a presidential primary will unfold with a sitting president seeking re-election while also facing an impeachment inquiry. There is no political playbook for this. No pollster or strategist to speak from experience. What is clear, from interviews with advisers and allies with the various campaigns, is that the top candidates like Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren believe they are sufficiently established in the race that they can continue to command attention for their candidacies and messages. Second-tier and third-tier candidates, however, are at much greater risk of falling off the radar screen for an electorate that may soon be at a standstill, distracted by an impeachment circus in Washington. \u201cThis is a nuclear bomb dropped in the middle of the race and it\u2019s going to change the dynamics for everyone,\u201d said Jared Leopold, an aide to Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington, who dropped out of the race several weeks ago. \u201cYou can\u2019t go on pretending it was like it was a week ago.\u201d \u201cIt scrambles the playing field,\u201d he added. The political intensity surrounding impeachment was on vivid display at a private Biden fund-raiser on Thursday afternoon in California, where Mr. Biden said that Mr. Trump had tried to \u201chijack the election\u201d by asking the president of Ukraine to help undertake a corruption investigation against the former vice president and his son, Hunter Biden. \u201cHe\u2019d like to get foreign help to win elections,\u201d Mr. Biden said. The stark new reality for the Democratic haves and have-nots is rooted in the bifurcated political landscape of the 2020 campaign. For months, it has played out on cable television, where some candidates have been able to convert appearances into polling bumps and greater fund-raising. It has also played out on the campaign trail, where candidates have tried to catch fire with voters by talking about rising prescription drug bills, child care costs and student debt burdens. For weeks ahead, if not months, cable shows will be so crowded with news and analysis of impeachment that only the top Democrats may have a guaranteed shot at getting on the airwaves. And in places like Iowa and New Hampshire, it may become harder for lower-polling candidates to get attention and break through there, too, amid the ongoing focus on Washington. \u201cThese hearings are going to be taking place while the primary contests are unfolding,\u201d Matt Barreto, a co-founder of the polling firm Latino Decisions, said. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be wall-to-wall coverage of impeachment, how do they find space to talk about Medicare for all, immigration reform or criminal justice reform?\u201d On Wednesday, as new revelations about Mr. Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine unfolded on cable news, strategists, aides and allies on lower-polling campaigns cracked dark jokes about their futures, privately worrying that an expected nonstop news media focus on impeachment could be fatal for their campaigns. More than a dozen candidates have staked their presidential bids on a breakout moment that has not yet happened, one they argue could come if Mr. Biden falters. With Mr. Biden and his son at the center of the impeachment drama, Ms. Warren ascendant and the nation\u2019s attention focused on what happens with Mr. Trump, the path for everyone else vying for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination just got a lot harder. The new normal may be campaign stunts like the almost-all-access bus tour Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., took reporters on this week in Iowa, dubbed the \u201cLive Tweet Express\u201d by Politico for the real-time chronicling reporters did of its exploits. Making matters worse for candidates who have seen their fund-raising pace slow dramatically since the end of June, the House\u2019s turn toward impeachment comes in the last week of the quarter, just days before a Sept. 30 deadline that, for several candidates, will serve as the latest marker of their financial viability. In the last 48 hours, there have been signs that candidates other than Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren are beginning to recalibrate their strategies to keep their campaigns relevant. Mr. Sanders, who for decades has refused to allow current events to alter his campaign strategy, held a rare news conference Tuesday in Davenport, Iowa, hours before the formal impeachment inquiry was announced. He provided a revealing glimpse into the two sides of impeachment for the candidates, castigating Mr. Trump for committing what he believed were \u201cimpeachable offenses\u201d while also pulling back and acknowledging that impeachment proceedings posed political risks for both sides. \u201cThis is a complicated issue from a political point of view,\u201d he said. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, who on Saturday launched a fund-raising drive that his campaign manager said was critical to his staying in the race, appeared Tuesday night on the same MSNBC program with Senator Kamala Harris of California \u2014 a demotion for two candidates who typically headline their own shows. The next morning Mr. Booker appeared on \u201cFox and Friends\u201d for the first time as a presidential candidate, talking about impeachment on the president\u2019s favorite morning news show \u2014 an apparent attempt to draw himself into Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter-based news cycles. Overwhelming numbers of Democrats nationwide support impeachment, with nearly three-quarters backing the House moving forward, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday morning. Yet, the topic has not gained primary candidates much traction on the campaign trail. In part, that is because impeachment is not a distinguishing issue; all the leading candidates support moving forward with an impeachment investigation. \u201cThere\u2019s an underlying stipulation that Trump should be impeached and the Democratic candidates all agree on that point,\u201d said Geoff Garin, a pollster working for Priorities USA, a Democratic super PAC. \u201cSo questions about that don\u2019t help voters sort out one candidate from the other.\u201d Democratic officials and strategists say primary voters are more eager to hear about the issues that directly impact their lives, like health care, immigration and the economy. \u201cWhen we knock on doors the thing we hear about most is health care costs,\u201d Ben Wikler, chairman of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin, said. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense that Washington and the Trump administration are spinning out of control but what\u2019s agonizing about that to voters is they have actual problems in their lives.\u201d The only exception may be Mr. Biden, who finds his family at the center of Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks, which continued in a Wednesday news conference carried by all the major broadcast and cable networks \u2014 though MSNBC cut away early. Some of Mr. Biden\u2019s advisers and allies are aware that Mr. Trump\u2019s focus on Mr. Biden\u2019s son Hunter and his business dealings in Ukraine carries potential risk for him. Yet they also believe that Mr. Biden is at his strongest when he is challenging Mr. Trump over American values and the direction of the nation, rather than relitigating his past, and his verbal gaffes, with his Democratic rivals. The new impeachment focus offers the former vice president an opportunity to draw direct contrasts with Mr. Trump at a time when many Democrats are inclined to be protective of Mr. Biden, aides and allies say. They also argue that Mr. Trump\u2019s focus on Mr. Biden suggests the president is worried about Mr. Biden\u2019s candidacy, a message the Biden campaign has reinforced through fund-raising appeals. \u201cIt reminds him of when he was young and had a stuttering problem and dealt with bullies then,\u201d said Representative Cedric Richmond, a Louisiana Democrat who is a national co-chairman of Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign. \u201cAnd he\u2019s dealing with bullies now.\u201d But it may be Ms. Warren who most benefits from the timing of the impeachment inquiry. It comes just as she was beginning to receive increased scrutiny from her rivals and the press over her opaque answers on health care policy. Impeachment swings the news pendulum back to one of Ms. Warren\u2019s strengths \u2014 in April she was the first top-tier candidate to call for impeaching Mr. Trump, a move that helped infuse her then-listing campaign with momentum that has yet to slow down. Impeachment may also serve to shield Ms. Warren from fresh attacks from her Democratic rivals seeking to take aim at someone who has overtaken Mr. Biden atop some early-state polling. With the news media focused on impeachment, attacking Ms. Warren over an issue like health care may be like shouting into a void, aides to rival candidates said. \u201cImpeachment is good news for Elizabeth Warren,\u201d Jeff Link, a longtime Democratic strategist, said. \u201cIf everything gets frozen, she\u2019s either at the top or near the top.\u201d The impeachment drama does not appear likely to force any dramatic recalibration of Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign. Unlike most of her rivals, she is not starving for attention. \u201cIt is time for impeachment now,\u201d Ms. Warren told a crowd Wednesday night in Keene, N.H. \u201cI\u2019m glad to see that the House has stepped up, and I hope we do this, and I hope we do it quickly.\u201d She then went back to her stump speech.",

      "author": "Alexander Burns",
      "content": "  Allies of Joseph R. Biden Jr., concerned about his slipping poll numbers in the Democratic presidential primary and an onslaught of attacks from President Trump, are weighing whether to mobilize a super PAC supporting Mr. Biden and have held conversations with wealthy donors to gauge their interest in contributing money. Mr. Biden and his campaign aides have said since the start of the race that they would not welcome an outside spending effort on his behalf, and every other major Democratic candidate has sworn off super PACs for the duration of the primary. A spokesman for Mr. Biden on Thursday reiterated that he opposed super PACs and would reject any such group that attempted to support him. Yet several former staffers of Mr. Biden and political donors backing his candidacy have held conversations in recent weeks about moving ahead with a super PAC, and said Mr. Trump\u2019s furious, and often unsubstantiated, allegations about the former vice president had convinced them it was imperative they act. \u201cFor me, this week puts everything into stark relief,\u201d said Larry Rasky, a former aide to Mr. Biden who is now a political fund-raiser and public relations executive. \u201cAnd I was already thinking the campaign was being a little na\u00efve about the resources we\u2019d need to fight this.\u201d In Mr. Rasky\u2019s office in Washington last week, a small group of Biden allies briefly discussed the possibility of a pro-Biden super PAC. Philip Munger, a prominent Democratic donor, and Mark Riddle, a political strategist, were among those who participated. Conversations about a super PAC were well underway earlier this month, even before news broke of Mr. Trump\u2019s attempt to enlist the leader of Ukraine to investigate Mr. Biden. Mr. Riddle was involved in filing paperwork for a pro-Biden super PAC, named For the People, earlier this year. The Biden campaign disavowed it last spring, and there is no evidence that the group has raised any money since then. Mr. Riddle suggested that could change. \u201cThe vice president is getting hit from all directions,\u201d Mr. Riddle said in an interview, alluding to some negative advertising by a Republican group, Great America PAC. \u201cA lot of us believe there should be a fair fight. He can hold his own with his campaign in these early states or whatnot, but there\u2019s only so much incoming somebody can take without a response.\u201d T.J. Ducklo, a spokesman for Mr. Biden, said Mr. Biden would reject any super PACs that joined the race on his side. Invoking the Supreme Court decision that made such groups legal, Mr. Ducklo said Mr. Biden \u201chas long advocated to reverse Citizens United and stand up against the corrupt money in our politics.\u201d And while some of Mr. Biden\u2019s supporters see the anti-Biden efforts by Mr. Trump\u2019s allies as a reason to solicit their own outside money, Mr. Ducklo said the campaign took an opposing view. \u201cThe attacks aimed at this campaign from dark money groups helping Donald Trump spread his outlandish lies and slander have only served as a reminder of the urgent need for campaign finance reform,\u201d Mr. Ducklo said. \u201cWhich is exactly why since the beginning of this campaign, Biden for President has not and will not welcome the help of super PACs. That goes for those that purport to help him, despite his explicit condemnation of their existence.\u201d In addition to its public statements, Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign has warned off some Democrats from participating in a super PAC. One prominent Democrat, David Wilhelm, a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said he had been approached about being involved in the pro-Biden super PAC but had declined to do so after the campaign urged him against it. Mr. Riddle said a final decision about whether to deploy a super PAC for Mr. Biden would be made in \u201cthe coming weeks.\u201d Mr. Biden clearly needs to jolt his campaign, which has lost ground in the early nominating states to Senator Elizabeth Warren, who has been largely unscathed by her rivals. And the vice president\u2019s longtime friends increasingly believe that Ms. Warren\u2019s growing strength \u2014 along with Mr. Trump\u2019s offensive \u2014 is reason enough to risk the backlash they would get from their opponents and campaign finance reform advocates for creating a group reliant on large contributions. But Mr. Riddle said there had been no final decision on whether to proceed with a super PAC, in part because of this risk. Mr. Biden\u2019s two leading competitors for his party\u2019s nomination, Ms. Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, have made getting big money out of politics a major theme of their campaigns. And Mr. Biden has already drawn criticism for his comparative reliance on wealthy donors to fund his candidacy. \u201cI\u2019m mindful that any effort to do this is going to be disowned by the campaign because of the way Warren has replayed her hand,\u201d said Mr. Rasky, alluding to the senator\u2019s decision not to solicit large campaign checks as a presidential candidate, despite having done so in her Senate campaign. Mr. Riddle said that any pro-Biden advertising would be focused on responding to attacks from Mr. Trump and Republicans, rather than targeting other Democrats. Despite Mr. Munger\u2019s presence at the meeting last week, Mr. Riddle said Mr. Munger was not involved in devising the pro-Biden group and had not contributed any money so far. Mr. Munger is the son of Charles Munger, a billionaire who is the vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett\u2019s investment firm. There have been a few fitful attempts so far to use super PACs on behalf of specific Democratic presidential candidates, but none of them has had a major impact on the race. A super PAC promoting Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington ran a wave of television ads in Iowa, but Mr. Inslee did not rise in the polls. And Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey sternly disavowed an effort by one Democratic donor, Steve Phillips, to lead a super PAC promoting his campaign. Tiffany Muller, president of End Citizens United, a progressive group that supports stricter campaign finance laws, said Mr. Biden was right to reject any group that might attempt to raise and spend money in unlimited increments. She credited him with being \u201can outspoken opponent of single-candidate super PACs.\u201d \u201cThe Democratic nominee should be chosen by voters, not millionaires and corporate special interests,\u201d Ms. Muller said. Still, Mr. Biden\u2019s political position now appears precarious enough that some of his supporters believe it may be worth taking the considerable risk of activating a group that could raise and spend large sums of money to support him. While Mr. Biden remains at the top of the Democratic field, his poll numbers have slowly weakened over the course of the race, leaving him at risk of slipping behind Ms. Warren or Mr. Sanders in three of the four early primary and caucus states. A poll released this week by Quinnipiac University found Ms. Warren slightly ahead of Mr. Biden in the preferences of Democratic voters nationwide, though her lead was less than the margin of error. The next round of fund-raising reports, due after the end of the month, will also reveal whether Mr. Biden is still in a strong financial position relative to his nearest competitors. In the last quarter, Mr. Biden raised the second-most money of any candidate, trailing only Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind. But he finished June with less money in the bank than Mr. Buttigieg, Ms. Warren, Mr. Sanders and Senator Kamala Harris of California.",

HerndonPRINT EDITIONWorking Families Party, a Major Progressive Force, Endorses Warren|September 17, 2019, Page A18",
      "author": "Astead W. Herndon",
      "content": " The Working Families Party, the labor-aligned progressive group whose electoral influence has grown since the 2016 election, has endorsed Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts for the Democratic presidential nomination, a boon to her candidacy as she attempts to position herself as the main challenger to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. The party endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont during the last presidential cycle, at which time he described Working Families as \u201cthe closest thing\u201d to \u201cmy vision of democratic socialism.\u201d The group\u2019s endorsement of Ms. Warren on Monday, one of the few by a prominent progressive organization this early in the primary, could turn heads among left-leaning Democrats desperate to defeat Mr. Biden, the more moderate front-runner, in a primary election where their party\u2019s ideological future is at stake. \u201cSenator Warren knows how to kick Wall Street kleptocrats where it hurts, and she\u2019s got some truly visionary plans to make this country work for the many,\u201d said Maurice Mitchell, the Working Families Party\u2019s national director. \u201cWe need a mass movement to make her plans a reality, and we\u2019re going to be a part of that work.\u201d Mr. Mitchell brushed off the possibility that the group\u2019s endorsement would be seen as a sign of a splintering of the progressive left. The vote among \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of party members and national committee leaders resulted in a commanding majority for Ms. Warren, a party spokesman said; she received more than 60 percent of the votes on the first ballot. But the announcement was met with derision from some of Mr. Sanders\u2019s supporters. The national committee leaders \u2014 56 people \u2014 held 50 percent of the voting power, with party members accounting for the other 50 percent. Several Sanders supporters called for the Working Families Party to release the full vote totals, which it has declined to do. Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign shook up its New Hampshire staff over the weekend as Ms. Warren continued to make inroads among progressives. Ms. Warren is coming off a debate performance last week that was generally well received, and she held a rally in New York on Monday that drew thousands to Washington Square Park. Also on Monday, Ms. Warren unveiled a plan to combat corruption in government, a core theme of her campaign. The plan is based on a wide-ranging anticorruption bill that she first proposed last year and is a cornerstone of her stump speech on the campaign trail. Mr. Mitchell and other Working Families Party leaders said in interviews that their endorsement came with a message to other progressive organizations. Rather than passively observe the primary, they said, these groups should choose a side and flex their organizing muscle during the early stages to help knock Mr. Biden off his perch. \u201cIf our focus is on victory, we can\u2019t be delusional about it,\u201d Mr. Mitchell said. \u201cYou don\u2019t defeat the moderate wing of Democrats through thought pieces or pithy tweets, you defeat their politics through organizing.\u201d Traditional bellwether endorsements from labor unions like American Federation of Teachers and the Service Employees International Union have not yet materialized, though Mr. Sanders picked up an endorsement from the United Electrical workers in August. With less than five months to go before the Iowa caucuses formally begin the nominating contest, many organizations are still wrestling with a sprawling Democratic field. \u201cThere are some great arguments for progressives rallying around a single candidate as soon as possible and others for taking the time to see how the contest develops,\u201d said Yvette Simpson, chief executive of Democracy for America, another progressive group that endorsed Mr. Sanders four years ago. Ms. Simpson said her group did not plan to endorse a candidate before December. Mr. Sanders finished second in the Working Families Party vote, ahead of three other candidates: the former housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey and Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York. Most national polls show a top tier of three candidates in the Democratic primary \u2014 Mr. Biden, Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders \u2014 and Mr. Biden has remained the front-runner. Among the two leading progressive candidates, Mr. Sanders has traditionally enjoyed more support from working-class voters, helped by his name recognition held over from 2016. Ms. Warren has made significant gains in the last six months, but polling shows that most of that growth has come from college-educated voters. In the years since President Trump\u2019s election, candidates backed by the Working Families Party have won congressional, state and local races across the country, expanding the group\u2019s power base from the Acela corridor to the West Coast. The group also helped several left-wing candidates win seats in the New York State Legislature last year. Mr. Mitchell took over as national director for the party in 2018, after he rose in prominence during the Black Lives Matter movement born out of protests in Ferguson, Mo. The group\u2019s leaders stressed that, even with their endorsement, their intention was not to divide the progressive left between Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders. The senators are longtime friends and have been publicly supportive of each other\u2019s candidacies. But they are still locked in a battle to be the progressive standard-bearer. After the Working Families endorsement was announced on Monday, Misty Rebik, Mr. Sanders\u2019s Iowa state director, wrote on Twitter: \u201cThere is one movement politics presidential candidate. One. It\u2019s @BernieSanders.\u201d Outside the left wing of the party, more moderate Democrats have continued to sound alarms about progressives\u2019 ability to beat Mr. Trump, and about Ms. Warren\u2019s chances in particular. And many Republicans see the progressives\u2019 embrace of a \u201cMedicare for all\u201d health care system and the Green New Deal as general-election liabilities waiting to be exploited. Surrogates for other Democratic contenders \u2014 like Mr. Biden, Ms. Harris and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. \u2014 have tried to paint Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders as candidates of the elite, who talk about lofty ideologies instead of pragmatic solutions. \u201cMy concern about the vision from the Sanders-Warren approach is that it can polarize Americans, when we have other ways to deliver bold solutions without dividing the American people further,\u201d Mr. Buttigieg said Sunday on CNN. But Mr. Mitchell said he believed the Working Families Party could convert Democrats skeptical of wide-reaching progressive policies. \u201cI\u2019m not worried about converting people who are already committed to a structural change agenda,\u201d Mr. Mitchell said. \u201cI\u2019m worried about the people who are still trying to figure out where they land.\u201d",

      "author": "Alexander Burns",
      "content": "  After the 2016 election, Democratic leaders reached an all but unanimous conclusion: To defeat President Trump in 2020, they would have to do more than condemn his offensive behavior and far-right ideology, as Hillary Clinton had done. They would need, above all, to promote a clear and exciting agenda of their own. They took that lesson to heart in the midterm elections and afterward, capturing the House of Representatives with a focus on health care and then attempting to impress the electorate by passing legislation on matters like campaign finance reform and the minimum wage. As Democratic presidential contenders pushed campaigns built on big ideas, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi resisted a chorus of calls for impeachment, even from some of her party\u2019s leading 2020 candidates. Yet 13 months before the next election, Democratic leaders are now steering into a protracted, head-on clash with Mr. Trump. By seeking the Ukrainian government\u2019s help in tarring former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., Mr. Trump left them no choice, they say, but to pursue an impeachment inquiry that could consume the country\u2019s attention for months. Ms. Pelosi has indicated she aims to move the process along with haste, in part to avoid an election-year conflagration, but the exact course of the inquiry is impossible to foresee. All 19 Democratic presidential candidates now support the impeachment inquiry, and many Democrats are optimistic that voters will as well, because Mr. Trump is so unpopular and the allegations against him are grave and easily grasped. For now, Republicans are the party on the defensive, flummoxed by the cascading disclosures about Mr. Trump that have threatened to upend his re-election campaign. But there is also a general recognition, at every level of the Democratic Party, that impeachment could complicate their candidates\u2019 efforts to explain their policy ideas to the country and persuade voters they have a vision beyond ousting Mr. Trump. The party has been disappointed too many times, its leaders say, by betting that Mr. Trump\u2019s violations of political and cultural norms would bring about his downfall. On Friday evening, Ms. Pelosi declared at a conference of New Jersey Democrats in Atlantic City that she would not allow the 2020 election to become a campaign about impeachment. Insisting the inquiry \u201chas nothing to do with the election,\u201d she said the campaign would be fought on other terms. [Sign up for our politics newsletter and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race.] \u201cThat\u2019s about facts and the Constitution,\u201d Ms. Pelosi said of the impeachment process. \u201cThe election is about all of the issues and policies that we have a difference of opinion with the Republicans on, and they are very drastic \u2014 and they have nothing to do with impeachment.\u201d Ms. Pelosi has already advised the newest members of her caucus \u2014 the ones who secured the majority last year \u2014 that they will have to execute a careful balancing act in the coming weeks, to show voters in their districts that they can continue to pass important legislation. She is said to be particularly focused on a proposal to lower prescription drug prices that she unveiled last week, before the Ukraine saga began. But even before impeachment, House Democrats were gaining little traction with policy bills that withered in the Republican-controlled Senate. Polls have shown their proposals to be popular, but they have been routinely overshadowed in the news by Mr. Trump. There is little doubt that impeachment will become a singular obsession in the political world and dominate news coverage for as long as the inquiry is underway. A few early polls on impeachment suggest that public support for the inquiry is somewhat stronger than opposition to it, but those numbers could easily change in either direction as the process unfolds. [Which Democrats are leading the 2020 presidential race this week?] Diane Feldman, a Democratic pollster, said it would be difficult for the party to communicate with voters on issues besides impeachment for the duration of the process. But candidates up and down the ballot had to try to drive a message about policy all the same, she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s worth the effort, but it\u2019s a long shot,\u201d Ms. Feldman said. \u201cThat we not put all of our eggs in the impeachment basket seems to me extremely wise.\u201d However, Ms. Feldman said, the impeachment process could also \u201cadd some clarity to risks that Trump presents to our national security and foreign policy\u201d and sharpen the overall Democratic case against his re-election. The task of balancing impeachment against policy priorities will be especially delicate for lawmakers elected last year, including dozens who won narrow victories in historically Republican districts. Democrats are defending a sizable number of seats that Mr. Trump carried in 2016, in parts of the country like upstate New York, Oklahoma City and northern Maine, where the impeachment issue is likely to stir backlash. Congressional Republicans are likely to struggle in a different way, as they face pressure from their party\u2019s conservative base to defend Mr. Trump even as he behaves in erratic or legally questionable ways. Democratic presidential candidates are attempting their own juggling act, mixing denunciations of Mr. Trump\u2019s actions on Ukraine with detailed policy promises. Mr. Biden, the candidate most directly connected to the impeachment uproar, has repeatedly denounced Mr. Trump but has declined to reorient his activities around responding to the president. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Mr. Biden\u2019s leading competitor in the primary, has reminded voters this week that she was the first major Democratic candidate to demand Mr. Trump\u2019s impeachment. But she, too, has not dwelled on the subject in her speeches, and she has indicated she would prefer to avoid a sprawling, open-ended process. And at the same Democratic gathering in New Jersey where Ms. Pelosi spoke on Friday, Senator Cory Booker urged his party to avoid \u201cpartisan glee\u201d about the prospect of impeaching Mr. Trump. Talking to reporters outside the event, he said Democrats should keep campaign considerations separate from impeachment: \u201cIt\u2019s just something that I need to deal with in a very sober way,\u201d he said, \u201caway from politics.\u201d But Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren may be among the only Democratic candidates who can count on breaking through the din of impeachment with regularity, along with Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and perhaps Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. For the rest of the Democratic field, strategists say, the next stage of the primary race may have less to do with delivering high-minded policy arguments on the national level than courting voters in the early primary and caucus states with personal appeals \u2014 as an impeachment battle rages in the foreground. Meredith Kelly, a Democratic strategist, said the experience of the last presidential race had not faded in the party\u2019s thinking. A veteran of the 2018 campaign to seize the House, Ms. Kelly said Democratic candidates would have to both build a \u201cmethodical\u201d case against Mr. Trump during the impeachment inquiry and also keep detailing \u201ca proactive vision of what you stand for.\u201d \u201cIt was a lesson from 2016: You couldn\u2019t only call out Donald Trump without your own positive vision for the country,\u201d said Ms. Kelly, who advised Senator Kirsten Gillibrand\u2019s presidential campaign. \u201cYou cannot stop talking about kitchen-table issues and your vision for the country.\u201d Democratic voters this week expressed a combination of enthusiasm for impeachment and anxiety about potential political complications \u2014 and, at times, a desire to stay focused on policy. At Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign stop in Las Vegas on Friday, Rick Carter, 74, a voter from Henderson, Nev., said he had been highly skeptical of impeaching Mr. Trump until the recent revelations about Ukraine. The newest allegations, he said, were \u201cpretty clear, to the point.\u201d Still, Mr. Carter said he hoped candidates would continue training their attention on subjects like the cost of prescription drugs. \u201cI want to start focusing on what the American people need,\u201d he said. Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster, said that even in the tumult of impeachment there were opportunities for Democrats to emphasize policy. He pointed to Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign as one that was plainly \u201cbreaking through on policy\u201d even amid Mr. Trump\u2019s constant provocations. \u201cThe House has passed a lot of bills that have gotten very little news coverage,\u201d he noted. \u201cBut when members go home and have interactions with their constituents, they\u2019re going to spend a lot of time talking about their legislation to have Medicare negotiate for lower prices and give all people the benefit of lower drug prices.\u201d And while the impeachment process unfolds, Mr. Garin added, Democrats could likely count on Mr. Trump not to deliver a broad, policy-based message of his own. \u201cTrump\u2019s not really making any effort to do anything but rally his base on this,\u201d Mr. Garin said. \u201cAnd in doing that, I think he\u2019s probably aggravating his situation with voters in the center.\u201d",

      "author": "Thomas Kaplan",
      "content": " Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts brought her ascendant presidential campaign to New York City on Monday night, unspooling a forceful argument for attacking corruption in government in a defining speech of her White House bid. Addressing thousands of supporters in Washington Square Park, some holding up \u201cI\u2019m a Warren Democrat\u201d signs, Ms. Warren pressed her case to bring sweeping change to an economic and political system she views as fundamentally tilted to favor the wealthy and powerful. She spoke near the site of the Triangle shirtwaist factory fire of 1911, which killed 146 garment workers, most of them women. The fire spurred a push to improve workplace safety, which Ms. Warren harnessed as a parallel for the far-reaching change she wants to pursue as president. And once again, she urged Democrats to embrace her call for dramatic change \u2014 not the kind of incremental approach favored most notably by Joseph R. Biden Jr., the former vice president and the primary race\u2019s front-runner. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot at stake in this election, and I know people are scared,\u201d Ms. Warren said from a lectern in front of the park\u2019s marble arch. \u201cBut we can\u2019t choose a candidate we don\u2019t believe in just because we\u2019re too scared to do anything else. And Democrats can\u2019t win if we\u2019re scared and looking backward.\u201d Ms. Warren was introduced by Maurice Mitchell, the national director of the Working Families Party, which announced its endorsement of her earlier Monday. In her speech, Ms. Warren described President Trump as \u201ccorruption in the flesh,\u201d but added that \u201cour problems didn\u2019t start with Donald Trump.\u201d And in invoking the Triangle factory workers, she made explicit reference to the power of women to bring about change. \u201cWe\u2019re not here today because of famous arches or famous men,\u201d Ms. Warren told the crowd. \u201cIn fact, we\u2019re not here because of men at all. We\u2019re here because of some hard-working women.\u201d Throughout her remarks, Ms. Warren was repeatedly met with enthusiastic cheers, and the crowd broke into chants of \u201ctwo cents\u201d when Ms. Warren brought up her proposal to impose a 2 percent annual tax on the fortunes of the super rich. Beyond amplifying her call to confront corruption, a hallmark of her presidential bid, the speech was another chance for Ms. Warren to draw a big crowd on the campaign trail and put on display the enthusiasm she is generating among voters. In August, she drew 15,000 people in Seattle and 12,000 in St. Paul, according to her campaign. The New York City Department of Parks and Recreation said organizers had anticipated a crowd of 8,000 to 10,000 people for Monday\u2019s speech. Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign said the crowd exceeded 20,000, though that estimate could not be independently verified. With each big rally, Ms. Warren is solidifying her place in an exclusive club of presidential candidates who have become crowd magnets, exhilarating fans at events that can sometimes feel like rock concerts. In the 2004 election, it was Howard Dean, the former governor of Vermont, whose large crowds \u2014 including a big showing in Bryant Park in New York in August 2003 \u2014 offered a visibly striking signal of interest in his candidacy. Barack Obama drew enormous crowds in the 2008 race, including at a giant rally in Washington Square Park in September 2007. And in the 2016 election, Mr. Trump and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont were both buoyed by the electric crowds they commanded. Mr. Sanders, too, held a huge event in Washington Square Park, drawing a crowd before the 2016 New York primary that his campaign put at 27,000 people, though he went on to lose that contest to Hillary Clinton. Mr. Sanders has drawn big crowds this year as well. The recent history of crowd-magnet candidates offers a mixed track record of electoral success. Joe Trippi, who was Mr. Dean\u2019s campaign manager, said Ms. Warren was well positioned to draw sizable crowds in big cities, given her large email list and many grass-roots donors around the country. That is particularly true in a Democratic stronghold like New York; for example, through the end of June, Ms. Warren had an estimated 1,300 donors in a single ZIP code in Brooklyn that includes most of Park Slope. But Mr. Trippi cautioned that drawing a large audience in a big city does not necessarily translate to success in the early voting states. \u201cThe question is, can you build beyond that core into a more diverse Democratic constituency?\u201d Mr. Trippi asked. \u201cFifteen thousand people in Seattle does not equal winning South Carolina.\u201d Asked last week whether she thought crowd size mattered, Ms. Warren replied, \u201cI think it matters getting to talk to lots and lots and lots and lots of people.\u201d Earlier Monday, Ms. Warren unveiled an expansive plan to attack corruption in government, a central theme of her campaign. The plan is based on a wide-ranging anticorruption package she first proposed last year. On the campaign trail, she likes to call it \u201cthe biggest anticorruption plan since Watergate.\u201d Ms. Warren kicked off her campaign with a speech in Lawrence, Mass., at the Everett Mills, where textile workers went on strike in 1912. On Monday, she again invoked the setting of her speech, recalling the horrific scene of the Triangle shirtwaist factory fire. Before the fire, she said, female factory workers across New York City had been \u201csounding the alarm\u201d about their working conditions, but were no match for wealthy and well-connected factory owners. \u201cThe tragic story of the Triangle factory fire is a story about power,\u201d Ms. Warren said. \u201cA story of what happens when the rich and the powerful take control of government and use it to increase their own profits while they stick it to working people. But what happened in the aftermath of the fire is a different story about power \u2014 a story about our power, a story about what\u2019s possible when we fight together as one.\u201d Ms. Warren told the story of Frances Perkins, citing her efforts after the Triangle factory fire to improve conditions for workers, and, later, her tenure as labor secretary for Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Ms. Warren presented Ms. Perkins \u2014 \u201cone very persistent woman,\u201d she called her, drawing cheers \u2014 as a template of sorts for how a President Warren could bring about change. \u201cShe used the same model that she and her friends had used after the Triangle fire: She worked the political system relentlessly from the inside while a sustained movement applied pressure from the outside,\u201d Ms. Warren said, citing legacies like Social Security and the minimum wage. Even the lectern from which Ms. Warren delivered those lines had a connection to Ms. Perkins, who was the first female cabinet member: It was made with reclaimed wood from the Frances Perkins Homestead in Maine, her campaign said. As is her custom, Ms. Warren stayed after her speech to take pictures with anyone who wanted one. Linus Glenhaber, 18, a college student from Massachusetts, worked on his science homework as he waited. He praised Ms. Warren for how she reached back into American history as she spoke of corruption. \u201cWhen she was talking about the Triangle shirtwaist factory,\u201d he said, \u201cit felt relevant to today in this incredible way.\u201d Ms. Warren finished taking pictures around 11:40 p.m. \u2014 nearly four hours after she finished her speech. One figure who did not seem to factor into Monday\u2019s proceedings was New York City\u2019s mayor, Bill de Blasio, who like Ms. Warren is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination. \u201cThe mayor of this city is still running, and Elizabeth Warren turned this city out,\u201d said City Councilman Jimmy Van Bramer of Queens, who endorsed Ms. Warren last week. \u201cI\u2019m not being mean, but it\u2019s got to be devastating for him. But it\u2019s great for us.\u201d",

      "author": "Matt Stevens",
      "content": " Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont proposed a new corporate tax on Monday that would penalize some of the country\u2019s largest companies if they did not narrow the gap between what they pay their chief executives and what they pay their workers. The proposal is the latest measure from Mr. Sanders aimed at reducing income inequality \u2014 a pillar of his campaign for the Democratic nomination for president. It is also the latest example of the commitment by Mr. Sanders and his leading progressive rival, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, to use America\u2019s tax system to address the wide gulf between ordinary Americans and the rich. \u201cThe American people are sick and tired of corporate C.E.O.s who now make 300 times more than their average employees, while they give themselves huge bonuses and cut back on the health care and pension benefits of their employees,\u201d Mr. Sanders said in a statement. \u201cThey want corporations to invest in their workers, not just dividends, stock buybacks and outrageous compensation packages to their executives.\u201d Mr. Sanders\u2019s proposal would impose tax rate increases on companies whose chief executives make at least 50 times what their typical workers earn. The tax would apply to all private and publicly held corporations with annual revenue of more than $100 million, the Sanders campaign said. The tax penalties would begin at half a percentage point for companies that compensate their highest-paid employees between 50 and 100 times as much as their typical workers, then escalate as the pay gap increases. The biggest penalty \u2014 5 percentage points \u2014 would apply to companies that pay their top executives more than 500 times what they pay a typical worker. Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign said that if current pay patterns continued, the plan would raise about $150 billion over the next decade; the revenue would be used to pay for a plan he released earlier this month to eliminate an estimated $81 billion in existing medical debt. He followed that three days later by proposing an annual tax on the fortunes of the richest Americans, an idea that Ms. Warren has made a centerpiece of her presidential bid. The tax plans the two candidates have proposed would need to be passed by Congress to become law, an unlikely scenario if Republicans retain control of the Senate. Together, Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders have used the 2020 Democratic primary to offer up a substantial rethinking of the federal government\u2019s approach to taxation that would shift more of the burden of paying for government toward the wealthy. \u201cAt a time of massive income and wealth inequality, the American people are demanding that large, profitable corporations pay their fair share of taxes,\u201d Mr. Sanders said in his statement on his corporate tax proposal. \u201cIt is time to send a message to corporate America: If you do not end your greed and corruption, we will end it for you.\u201d Ms. Warren also wants to change how the country\u2019s most profitable corporations are taxed in order to ensure that they are paying their \u201cfair share.\u201d In April, she proposed a new tax on corporations that report more than $100 million in profits. Ms. Warren has another proposal about big corporations, the Accountable Capitalism Act, that addresses executive compensation. The proposal would restrict when top executives can sell company shares, and it would require that workers elect at least 40 percent of a company\u2019s board of directors.",

      "author": "Alan Rappeport",
      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 Progressive Democrats are advocating the most drastic shift in tax policy in over a century as they look to redistribute wealth and chip away at the economic power of the superrich with new taxes that could fundamentally reshape the United States economy. As they compete for the Democratic presidential nomination, Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont have proposed wealth taxes that would shrink the fortunes of the richest Americans. Their plans envision an enormous transfer of money from the wealthy to ordinary people, with revenue from the wealth tax used to finance new social programs like tuition-free college, universal child care and \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d The wealth taxes under discussion would deal a major blow to the balance sheets of American plutocrats like Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates and Warren Buffett. If the tax that Ms. Warren has called for had been in place since 1982, the net worth of the 15 richest Americans in 2018 would have been half as much, according to two economists who helped develop her plan. The Sanders wealth tax, which was released last week, would have eroded their fortunes even further, to barely one-fifth of their 2018 total. The idea of a wealth tax has become an animating issue for the Democratic Party, which sees it as a solution to long-festering concerns about inequality and the rapid concentration of economic power among wealthy Americans. Its emergence is also an antidote to the policies of President Trump, whose $1.5 trillion tax cut largely benefited rich Americans and corporations while leaving future generations with the bill. \u201cWe are living in the second Gilded Age,\u201d said Bruce Ackerman, a professor of law and political science at Yale University, referring to the stark wealth gap produced by the Industrial Revolution. \u201cWhat we have once again is people both on the right and the left being provoked by the perception they are being left behind.\u201d [Bernie Sanders raised $25.3 million in the most recent fund-raising quarter, reflecting his continued strength with small-dollar donors.] But the idea of redistributing wealth by targeting billionaires is stirring fierce debates at the highest ranks of academia and business, with opponents arguing it would cripple economic growth, sap the motivation of entrepreneurs who aspire to be multimillionaires and set off a search for loopholes. \u201cYou\u2019re going to completely disincentivize capital investment, which is going to be very, very bad for economic growth,\u201d Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in an interview  in September. \u201cTaxing capital is not a good thing for creating economic growth, and if anything we should be looking at how we create more incentives for economic growth.\u201d Income inequality has surged in the United States in the last 50 years, with the top 0.1 percent now controlling about a fifth of the nation\u2019s wealth. That concentration of wealth has coincided with stagnant wages, rising college costs and the lingering effects of the Great Recession, which erased trillions of dollars in household wealth, ravaging the middle class. New figures from the Census Bureau released last week show that income inequality in the United States reached its highest level last year since the government began tracking it in 1967. The dueling policy proposals from Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders come as they compete intensely for support from the same universe of liberal voters and activists. Their tax proposals are helping to galvanize those on the left, but their ideas will also provide fodder for Republicans eager to paint them in a general election as tax-happy and too liberal. Polls have found widespread support for the idea of taxing wealth. A poll conducted for The New York Times by the internet research firm SurveyMonkey this summer found that two-thirds of Americans, including a majority of Republicans, backed a 2 percent tax on households worth over $50 million, which is the heart of Ms. Warren\u2019s plan. The proposals for a wealth tax are among a variety of ideas for collecting more tax revenue that Democratic presidential candidates have put forward. On Monday, Mr. Sanders proposed a new tax on corporations that have a huge gap between what they pay their chief executive and their median worker. Jared Bernstein, who was chief economist for Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. from 2009 to 2011, said he has discussed with the Biden campaign a proposal to tax financial transactions. [The latest data and analysis to keep track of who\u2019s leading the race to be the Democratic nominee.] On the campaign trail, Ms. Warren explains the concept of a wealth tax by putting it in familiar terms, likening it to the property taxes that many Americans pay on their homes. For the superrich, she said in South Carolina on Saturday, \u201chow about we include in yours not only your real estate, but also your stock portfolio, the diamonds, the Rembrandt and the yacht?\u201d Mr. Sanders is blunt about his desire to reduce the size of America\u2019s biggest fortunes, even highlighting how much individual billionaires would have to pay in taxes under his proposal. He said last week that he did not believe billionaires should exist in the United States. \u201cThere\u2019s no question to my mind that the United States is moving toward an oligarchy,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cThis is an issue that has to be addressed, and this wealth tax begins to do that.\u201d  The United States largely taxes individuals based on the income they earn through their jobs and investments. Wealth taxes impose annual levies on an individual\u2019s accumulated assets, everything from vacation homes and art collections to stakes in companies and family heirlooms. The tax proposed by Ms. Warren would apply to households worth over $50 million. She would impose a 2 percent tax on net worth above $50 million, and a 3 percent tax on net worth above $1 billion. The plan from Mr. Sanders would apply to a larger number of households, and it would be particularly aggressive on billionaires. His tax would start out at 1 percent on net worth from $32 million to $50 million for married couples, and it would top out at 8 percent on net worth over $10 billion. Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, the two University of California, Berkeley, economists who helped Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders develop their plans, project that Ms. Warren\u2019s proposal would hit about 70,000 households and generate $2.6 trillion in revenue for the federal government over a decade. They project that Mr. Sanders\u2019s proposal would apply to 180,000 households and raise $4.35 trillion over 10 years. Mr. Zucman said in an interview that he believes a wealth tax would have a modest but positive impact on growth. By reducing the power of the wealthiest, he argued, it would make markets more competitive and spur innovation. [Who\u2019s in? Who\u2019s out? Keep up with the 2020 field with our candidate tracker.] But redirecting such vast sums could have unintended effects on the United States economy that go beyond promulgating economic fairness. While Ms. Warren ticks off the social programs that can be funded if the richest Americans pay just 2 cents on every dollar they have above $50 million \u2014 a number that is unimaginable to most Americans \u2014 skeptics warn of economic stagnation, depressed business confidence and a legal battle that would go to the Supreme Court. At a conference sponsored by the Brookings Institution in September, N. Gregory Mankiw, a Harvard economist, debated Mr. Saez and Mr. Zucman about the merits of taxing wealth. Mr. Mankiw, the former head of President George W. Bush\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, offered a searing critique, arguing that a wealth tax would skew incentives that could alter when the superrich make investments, how they give to charity and even potentially spur a wave of divorces for tax purposes. He also noted that billionaires, with their legions of lawyers and accountants, have proven to be experts at gaming the system to avoid even the most onerous taxes. \u201cOn the one hand it\u2019s a bad policy, and then the other thing is it\u2019s a feckless policy,\u201d Mr. Mankiw said. Left-leaning economists have expressed their own doubts about a wealth tax. Earlier this year, Lawrence Summers, who was President Bill Clinton\u2019s Treasury secretary, warned in an article with Natasha Sarin, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania, that wealth taxes would sap innovation by putting new burdens on entrepreneurial businesses while they are starting up. In their view, a country with more millionaires is a sign of economic vibrancy. \u201cTurning the tax code into a vehicle for confronting what some call \u2018oligarchic drift\u2019 would undermine business confidence, reduce investment, degrade economic efficiency and punish success in ways unlikely to be good for the country or even to be appealing to most Americans,\u201d they wrote. Corporate America has also come out against a wealth tax. At a recent briefing by the Business Roundtable, a lobbying group for large companies, Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, said he feared that the federal government would squander the additional revenue. \u201cI know a lot of wealthy people who would be happy to pay more in taxes; they just think it\u2019ll be wasted and be given to interest groups and stuff like that,\u201d Mr. Dimon said. Other obstacles that often raise concern about wealth taxes are how to value assets like art and private businesses when determining wealth, and the potential impact on stock markets if rich shareholders suddenly have to liquidate their holdings to pay their tax bills. Despite the many obstacles, a wealth tax in the United States could prove to be a political winner for Democrats and serve as a rejoinder to Mr. Trump, who has allowed deficits to swell by cutting taxes without curbing spending. Ms. Warren makes a point of stressing she is not looking to punish the rich, and she presents the tax as quite modest: just 2 cents on every dollar over $50 million in net worth. That 2-cent tax \u2014 which rises to 3 cents on net worth over $1 billion \u2014 amounts to a golden key that unlocks other policy plans, covering the cost of proposals like student debt cancellation, free public college and universal child care. Ms. Warren\u2019s White House bid is the rare political campaign where a tax rate has become a catchy slogan: Crowds have broken out into chants of \u201c2 cents!\u201d and at a recent political event in Iowa, two of her campaign staffers dressed up as pennies. \u201cI think that what she does really brilliantly is takes a policy that\u2019s really cumbersome and makes it really simple and straightforward,\u201d Victoria Farris, 38, said after Ms. Warren gave a speech in New York in September. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be an economist, you don\u2019t have to have an advanced degree \u2014 2 cents is 2 cents.\u201d",

      "content": "  The Democratic field got a little bit smaller this week, shrinking to 19 candidates. Here\u2019s our weekly catch-up on the 2020 election and some moments you may have missed. Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York, who entered the Democratic presidential race on the hopes that his brand of urban progressive leadership could appeal on a national scale, said on Friday that he was ending his candidacy. Mr. de Blasio\u2019s campaign never quite caught on, and his announcement came less than two weeks before the qualification deadline for the October debate. His inclusion in the event was growing less likely by the day. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve contributed all I can to this primary campaign, and it\u2019s clearly not my time,\u201d he said in an appearance on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m going to end my presidential campaign, continue my work as mayor of New York City, and I\u2019m going to keep speaking up for working people.\u201d Monday was big for Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. She received the endorsement of the Working Families Party, a labor-aligned progressive group that endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont during the last presidential cycle. She released a 6,000-word anti-corruption plan, which would make the release of tax returns automatic for candidates for federal office, make it illegal for elected officials to become lobbyists and strengthen ethics requirements for federal judges. And in a speech at a rally in Manhattan that drew thousands to Washington Square Park, she forcefully attacked corruption and invoked the power of women to bring about sweeping change. Ms. Warren delivered the speech blocks from the site of the Triangle shirtwaist factory fire of 1911, which killed 146 garment workers, most of them immigrant women. It was one of the deadliest industrial disasters in the nation\u2019s history. \u201cThe tragic story of the Triangle factory fire is a story about power,\u201d Ms. Warren said. \u201cA story of what happens when the rich and the powerful take control of government and use it to increase their own profits while they stick it to working people. But what happened in the aftermath of the fire is a different story about power \u2014 a story about our power, a story about what\u2019s possible when we fight together as one.\u201d With five months to go before the New Hampshire primary, Mr. Sanders overhauled his operations in the state, which he won by more than 22 percentage points in 2016. Mr. Sanders, who hails from neighboring Vermont, almost certainly must win New Hampshire again next year to have a chance at the nomination. The campaign also parted ways with its political director in Iowa, according to a report that surfaced later in the week. Read more about that move here. Several candidates called for the impeachment of Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh after The New York Times published new information about allegations of sexual misconduct against him. Ms. Warren, Mr. Sanders and Senator Kamala Harris of California were among those who called for the justice\u2019s impeachment. \u201cHe was put on the Court through a sham process and his place on the Court is an insult to the pursuit of truth and justice,\u201d Ms. Harris wrote. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. called the revelations \u201cprofoundly troubling\u201d but stopped short of demanding impeachment. Instead, he called for an investigation into \u201cwhether the Trump administration and Senate Republicans pressured the F.B.I. to ignore evidence.\u201d Former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas released a plan on Thursday to legalize marijuana, expunge all possession convictions and regulate the substance the way alcohol is regulated. Sales would be limited to adults, smoking would be banned in public areas, and advertising would be restricted. He also wants to tax the marijuana industry and invest the revenue in the communities of color disproportionately affected by the war on drugs. Every Democratic candidate supports decriminalizing marijuana, and most, including Mr. O\u2019Rourke, support full legalization. But six candidates \u2014 Mr. Biden, Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana, Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Mayor Wayne Messam of Miramar, Fla., and former Representative Joe Sestak of Pennsylvania \u2014 want to leave the question of legalization up to the states. Overheard on the campaign trail? \u201cI\u2019m moving to Iowa,\u201d Ms. Harris joked in a comment to Senator Mazie Hirono of Hawaii that included an expletive and was overheard by a reporter. The state of California did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Ms. Harris\u2019s remark came as her campaign announced a new push in the state. In a call with reporters Thursday morning, aides said they hoped to position Ms. Harris for a late-breaking Iowa surge. And they set a firm target: a top-three finish. Ms. Harris\u2019s team sent out a fund-raising email based on her quip. And, of course, there are already T-shirts.",

In the fight to get it done, she honed the approach to politics that defines her presidential campaign.By Alexander BurnsPRINT EDITIONIn Losing a Coveted Position, Warren Found a Larger Stage|September 22, 2019, Page A1",
      "author": "Alexander Burns",
      "content": " Elizabeth Warren did not want a goodbye party. She told her aides there would be no grand send-off, no celebration of a mission accomplished. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau had been her idea from the start: a new arm of the government, uniquely empowered to police the kinds of loans and financial schemes that led to the Great Recession. Ms. Warren had detailed the idea in a journal article, then cajoled and pressured Congress to make it law. She was tasked by President Barack Obama in 2010 with setting up the bureau, and spent a year recruiting investigators and enforcers for an office they saw as an exhilarating cause. But as spring turned to summer in 2011, Ms. Warren faced a wrenching separation. The White House had decided not to nominate her to lead the bureau permanently. So she gathered the staff for an \u201call hands\u201d meeting and told them her work there was over. \u201cShe told us that we were ready to sail the ship, that we did not need her there, and that we would be able to do it on our own,\u201d said Patricia McCoy, a Boston College law professor who was a senior official at the bureau. Ms. Warren was right. Under her successor, Richard A. Cordray, the bureau would recover $12 billion for consumers from financial institutions by 2017. It would become, to supporters, a prized example of the government taking on big banks after the 2008 financial crisis. To opponents \u2014 Republican lawmakers, business associations and a few conservative Democrats \u2014 it would become an example of \u201crunaway government,\u201d an agency to be curbed at the first opportunity. To Ms. Warren, the bureau is something else as well: a formative lesson in how an idea \u2014 a plan \u2014 can become reality. For it was through creating a new financial regulator that Ms. Warren developed the approach to government that now guides her presidential campaign. And it was in losing the chance to lead her bureau that Ms. Warren came to see the value of asking voters, rather than a president, to give her power. A review of Ms. Warren\u2019s role in creating the consumer bureau, including interviews with more than 30 people involved in the process, revealed an approach to politics that joins imaginative policy ideas with a keen instinct for mass communication and a willingness to negotiate. On one hand, she marshaled support from progressive activists and helped build public demand for her idea; on the other, she haggled with members of Congress to earn their backing. David Axelrod, who was Mr. Obama\u2019s top political adviser during the battle to create the C.F.P.B., called Ms. Warren\u2019s role a \u201cbona fide credential\u201d for the presidency. \u201cThere aren\u2019t that many people who can say they had an idea, wrote about it and ended up bringing it to fruition, in terms of the creation of a whole new government agency with a very focused mission,\u201d Mr. Axelrod said. If some of Ms. Warren\u2019s rivals \u2014 and more than a few Democratic voters \u2014 question whether her ideas are realistic, she and her supporters answer by pointing to the consumer bureau. At the New Hampshire Democratic Party\u2019s convention this month, supporters of Ms. Warren broke out in chants of, \u201cC-F-P-B! She fights for you, she fights for me!\u201d In a recent interview, Ms. Warren described the creation of the bureau as a \u201cmodel\u201d for how she would seek to deploy her plans as president. At a September rally in Washington Square Park in New York, Ms. Warren likened herself to Frances Perkins, the first secretary of labor \u2014 a woman, she said, \u201cwho worked the political system relentlessly from the inside, while a sustained movement applied pressure from the outside.\u201d But if the bureau has been an enduring victory for Ms. Warren, it culminated in a painful disappointment. In the interview, Ms. Warren \u2014 an upbeat presence on the campaign trail \u2014 became somber when the conversation turned to her exit from the bureau. Asked about her insistence against having a farewell party, her eyes began to glisten. \u201cI couldn\u2019t say goodbye to all those people I\u2019d hired and all those people I\u2019d brought in to fight,\u201d Ms. Warren said, speaking slowly and quietly. \u201cI\u2019d made an implicit promise to lead the charge, and I would\u2019ve stayed and led it if I could have. But I couldn\u2019t. And I did not want to say goodbye to all of them.\u201d Ms. Warren\u2019s band of advisers, lawyers, researchers and technicians devised a more discreet send-off. Elizabeth Vale, a former White House official who was among Ms. Warren\u2019s close counselors, said an immense farewell card was made from a \u201cbig, big, big piece of cardboard,\u201d stamped with the electric-green logo of the C.F.P.B. and signed by scores of staff members. Still, Ms. Warren, then 62, declined to receive it before a throng of colleagues. \u201cI remember two of us brought it to her,\u201d Ms. Vale said, \u201cand then I remember when she walked out, she just walked out quietly, by herself.\u201d It all began with Ms. Warren\u2019s decision to write an article in the winter of 2007. She had endured one unhappy brush with Washington, testifying against a bill to tighten the bankruptcy code in a way she feared would burden low-income debtors. The proposal became law in 2005, with Joseph R. Biden Jr., then a senator, as its leading Democratic supporter. Back at Harvard, where she was teaching law, Ms. Warren began considering a new idea: a proposal for a government regulator to address the issue on which Congress had spurned her advice \u2014 the problem of consumer credit and the often-deceptive financial products being offered to ordinary people. She outlined the concept to Kenneth Baer, then 34, a former Clinton administration aide who with several like-minded Democrats had founded a publication, Democracy, to stir an ambitious policy debate among liberals. He was skeptical at first of Ms. Warren\u2019s regulatory proposal, wondering if forming a new government agency represented an \u201cold Democratic way of thinking.\u201d But Mr. Baer and his colleagues were hungry for big ideas to fill what they saw as an intellectual void in the Democratic Party, and he encouraged her to make the case for a new regulator. In a February email to Mr. Baer, Ms. Warren agreed to write it. As she tells it now, she was bursting for the chance. \u201cThe idea was ripe,\u201d she said. \u201cI was ready.\u201d A draft of the piece followed in late March. Ms. Warren urged her collaborators to \u201cedit aggressively,\u201d an instruction that proved unnecessary. A copy of her first version reviewed by a reporter shows its now-famous opening was scarcely changed. \u201cIn the U.S. today it is not possible to buy a toaster that has a 1-in-5 chance of bursting into flames and burning down a customer\u2019s house,\u201d Ms. Warren wrote in her draft. \u201cBut it is possible to refinance an existing home with a mortgage that has the same 1-in-5 chance of putting the family out on the street \u2014 without ever disclosing that fact to the homeowner.\u201d When Democracy published Ms. Warren\u2019s article in the summer of 2007, Mr. Baer and his colleagues promoted it \u2014 and its author \u2014 vigorously, booking Ms. Warren on CNN and winning coverage for her idea in national newspapers. And they promoted it to presidential campaigns, too. A breakthrough came in June when Heather McGhee, a policy adviser to Senator John Edwards, emailed Ms. Warren to say her candidate was about to endorse a new regulator for financial products. By early 2008, Ms. Warren and her sometime editors were musing over email that the proposal could really become law. When Ms. Warren noted praise for her idea in Newsweek, Andrei Cherny, a co-founder of Democracy, wrote back, \u201cNext stop: law of the land!\u201d \u201cI\u2019m working on it!\u201d Ms. Warren replied, signing off with her initials, EW, in lowercase. It had been decades since either political party had tried seriously to impose tougher financial regulations. Even sympathetic Democrats, like Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, questioned the feasibility. Ms. McGhee, who stayed in touch with Ms. Warren after the Edwards campaign ended, said she saw the professor straining to discern what to do and whom to turn to in Washington. \u201cShe really was trying to figure out how to have all the right conversations,\u201d Ms. McGhee said. \u201cAnd then the financial crisis happened.\u201d The Congressional Oversight Panel, a body set up to scrutinize Washington\u2019s bailout of the financial system, did not mention toasters in its \u201cspecial report\u201d on financial regulation. But the document, issued days after Mr. Obama\u2019s inauguration in 2009, was unmistakable in its suggestion. The report recommended creating a financial regulator that could gather up the fragmented enforcement tools of the federal government and seek to avert another financial crisis. It was a natural suggestion for the oversight body, since Ms. Warren was its chairwoman. Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader at the time, had named her to the post at the end of 2008, in the throes of a global financial catastrophe that sent unemployment soaring and threw millions of homeowners into foreclosure. From this perch, Ms. Warren began a campaign for her bureau. It was no longer a lonely effort. Mr. Frank, a powerful committee chairman, was now an ally. So was an emerging coalition of progressive groups, labor unions and consumer advocates, known as Americans for Financial Reform. Ms. Warren sought out its leader, Heather Booth, for insight into political organizing. \u201cShe knew many of the players on the policy side,\u201d Ms. Booth said. \u201cWhat she hadn\u2019t been experienced with were the politics.\u201d Ms. Warren also built alliances inside government, finding friends in people like Mr. Axelrod and Valerie Jarrett, one of Mr. Obama\u2019s closest advisers. Mr. Axelrod saw the bureau as a political necessity, the one part of financial reform ordinary voters might understand. At times, Ms. Warren\u2019s appeals were strikingly personal: Over dinner in Cambridge, Mass., Ms. Warren told Ms. Jarrett much of the life story that is now familiar to voters who follow her campaign, a tale of deep economic adversity for her family in Oklahoma. \u201cIt put in context why this policy was so important to her,\u201d Ms. Jarrett said. Mr. Obama embraced the proposal, putting a consumer bureau in his blueprint for financial reform in the spring of 2009 and talking on late-night television about exploding toasters. Ms. Warren was elated but uneasy. The financial industry was mobilizing, warning that a new regulator would damage the economic recovery. And Ms. Warren was concerned about two of Mr. Obama\u2019s lieutenants: Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and Lawrence H. Summers, who helmed the National Economic Council. She had profound philosophical disagreements with both men, who believed that her savage criticism of the bank bailouts revealed a misunderstanding of the role of Wall Street in the fragile economic recovery. \u201cTim and Larry were not fans of this agency,\u201d Ms. Warren said. \u201cI heard more than once from Senate and House staffers that they had proposed scrapping it in return for some other concession that they cared more about.\u201d Of Mr. Obama, she said: \u201cI never worried about the president. I was worried about his advisers.\u201d Mr. Obama remained forcefully supportive and senior officials at the Treasury Department helped negotiate the shape of the bureau at every stage. In the House, Ms. Warren blessed deals struck by Mr. Frank, including one exempting banks with less than $10 billion in assets from certain new regulatory requirements. The concession was intended to win over an influential trade group, the Independent Community Bankers of America, and its chief lobbyist, Cam Fine. The arrangement dismayed the left \u2014 until Ms. Warren endorsed it. \u201cShe was very realistic,\u201d Mr. Frank said. \u201cShe was deeply engaged in talking to members and she did acquire her own sense of what was politically doable.\u201d Ms. Warren had less influence in the Senate, where Democrats held the majority but their ability to break a filibuster hinged on centrist legislators. So Ms. Warren turned her attention beyond the chamber, rallying activists and talking to the media. In her most provocative move, she told HuffPost that the Senate must either create a \u201cstrong consumer agency\u201d or have \u201cno agency at all and plenty of blood and teeth left on the floor.\u201d \u201cThat,\u201d Ms. Warren said recently, \u201cis the outsider\u2019s game.\u201d The Senate ultimately approved a bureau that was stronger in some ways than Ms. Warren\u2019s 2007 proposal. Instead of a Financial Products Safety Commission, led by committee, it would be the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, headed by a single director. And it would draw funding from the Federal Reserve, putting its budget beyond reach of adversaries in Congress. Ms. Warren attended the July 2010 ceremony where Mr. Obama signed the Dodd-Frank bill into law, and with it a consumer bureau that he asked her to help set up. He designated her an aide to himself and to Mr. Geithner, with a mandate to build the regulator she had devised on paper in 2007. There was no promise she would become the permanent director. If Ms. Warren had won a landmark policy victory, it came at the cost of making enemies in Congress and the administration. While Mr. Geithner would criticize business groups for opposing the consumer bureau in a 2014 book, he also cast Ms. Warren as an implacable critic of the bank rescue, more focused on \u201cmade-for-YouTube\u201d grandstanding than on crafting practical ideas. He and Mr. Summers described her in White House meetings as unreasonably hostile to financial institutions, and as simply unreasonable. \u201cYou cannot play the role she was playing without making people mad at you,\u201d said former Representative Brad Miller, a North Carolina Democrat involved in drafting Dodd-Frank. He said of the Obama economic team, \u201cThose were folks who were used to getting their own way and not having to deal with critics at all.\u201d Mr. Geithner, now president of the private equity firm Warburg Pincus, declined through a spokeswoman to be interviewed. Mr. Summers, who has criticized some of Ms. Warren\u2019s 2020 campaign proposals, did not respond to interview requests. But Ms. Warren at times unnerved others in the administration. In a 2015 memoir, Mr. Axelrod wrote that Mr. Obama grew frustrated in 2010 with Ms. Warren\u2019s assertive efforts to position herself to become director \u2014 a possibility he feared would enrage banks and doom the Dodd-Frank bill. \u201cTell her to keep her mouth shut,\u201d Mr. Obama said, according to Mr. Axelrod\u2019s book. \u201cShe may well be the choice, but we can\u2019t surface that now.\u201d In the spring of 2011, Mr. Fine, the lobbyist for community banks, got a call from Ms. Jarrett. If the White House selected Ms. Warren to lead the consumer bureau, she asked, would he fight for her confirmation? Mr. Fine said he would. A few days later, Ms. Warren told Mr. Fine over lunch in downtown Washington that the White House had decided against nominating her. \u201cI said: \u2018That\u2019s just not right. Do you want me to start a campaign? Do you want me to demand a meeting over at the White House?\u2019\u201d said Mr. Fine, whose offers Ms. Warren declined. \u201cShe put on a brave face.\u201d For Ms. Warren, this setback came at the end of a whirlwind year setting up the bureau. Since Dodd-Frank became law, Ms. Warren had traveled widely and hired aggressively. Eager to show her organization was at work, she demanded swift, visible actions, like the creation of a complaint hotline with a public catalog of Americans\u2019 grievances against banks and other lenders. Her recruitment efforts had established the bureau as a political force, as well as a legal one. The staff swelled, and weekly meetings shifted from a modest conference room to an elevator-studded lobby. In a pair of public-relations coups, Ms. Warren asked Holly Petraeus, a Better Business Bureau official married to a renowned general, to lead the Office of Servicemember Affairs, and enlisted Mr. Cordray, the outgoing attorney general of Ohio, to lead her enforcement division. \u201cAs she put it to me: It\u2019s a chance to do on a nationwide basis what you\u2019re doing in Ohio, with more tools, more authority to pursue the banks,\u201d Mr. Cordray said, recalling Ms. Warren\u2019s pitch. It was a chance, in other words, to wield great power. But Ms. Warren would soon learn that hers was borrowed power \u2014 power delegated by the president, and for only a year. By the spring of 2011, the opposition to Ms. Warren becoming permanent director was unbending. Republican senators said they would never confirm her; so did Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, a conservative Democrat. Mr. Nelson, who is supporting Mr. Biden in the Democratic primary, said in an interview that he worried about empowering someone he saw as a champion of \u201crunaway government.\u201d \u201cI was very concerned about somebody who had been such a strong advocate for a government bureau that had virtually no control,\u201d Mr. Nelson said. Mr. Reid said Republican opposition sealed Ms. Warren\u2019s fate. \u201cThe Republicans stopped her from getting that job,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was her job.\u201d Among some of Ms. Warren\u2019s allies, frustration lingers about what happened in 2011. They blame not just Republicans, but also her rivals in the Obama administration and a harsh strain of sexism directed at her by political opponents and the media. \u201cMen never get this adjective, \u2018strident.\u2019 That bothers me, because I don\u2019t think she is,\u201d Ms. Petraeus said. \u201cYes, she\u2019s passionate. She doesn\u2019t hesitate to call somebody out, especially on the Hill, if they\u2019re trying to serve up a bunch of double-dealing nonsense.\u201d Sheila Bair, a Warren ally who was then at the head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, said she had been angry to learn the White House was leaning against nominating Ms. Warren. Her detractors in the administration, Ms. Bair said, had been \u201cwhispering behind the scenes that she couldn\u2019t get confirmed.\u201d \u201cEven if that is true, fight it out,\u201d Ms. Bair said. In the end, Mr. Obama concluded Mr. Cordray stood a better chance of clearing the Senate. Republicans would stonewall his nomination until 2013. It was Ms. Jarrett who called to inform Ms. Warren. She also suggested an alternative path forward: running for Senate. \u201cShe was not overly enthusiastic in our first call, because she never saw herself as a politician,\u201d Ms. Jarrett said, \u201cand I said I thought that\u2019s the reason she\u2019d be perfect for the job.\u201d Others in the administration, including Mr. Geithner\u2019s aides, saw the Senate race as a way to get Ms. Warren out of the executive branch. Mr. Miller, the former congressman, said he emailed Ms. Warren to warn that her critics might be trying to lure her \u201cinto a race that she could not win.\u201d But in September 2011, Ms. Warren entered the race against Senator Scott P. Brown of Massachusetts, starting down a path that has led with improbable speed to a presidential campaign. Her candidacy today resembles a vastly enlarged version of the movement that gave rise to the consumer bureau. In a campaign framed as a crusade of ideas, Ms. Warren has vowed to restructure the economy as president using the same methods that helped make her imagined agency a real structure of concrete and glass. It is not lost on Ms. Warren that, had she become the director, it is unlikely she would be a leading presidential candidate now. \u201cI would have stayed,\u201d she said, \u201cand done it forever.\u201d",

She shot back.By Matt StevensPRINT EDITIONZuckerberg\u2019s Disdain for Tech Breakup Is Made Clear, as Is Warren\u2019s Resolve|October 2, 2019, Page A19",
      "author": "Matt Stevens",
      "content": " For months, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts has made \u201cbig, structural change,\u201d the rallying cry of her presidential campaign. And when it comes to the tech sector, that has meant taking square aim at giant companies like Facebook \u2014 companies she says have become so large that they are stifling competition. Ms. Warren rolled out a proposal to break up Facebook, Amazon and other tech giants in March. To ensure that tech workers got her message, her campaign paid for a billboard near a major transit station in San Francisco. It read \u201cBreak Up Big Tech,\u201d in capital letters. On Tuesday, nearly seven months after Ms. Warren first unveiled her plan, The Verge offered a window into what Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, thinks about it. In leaked audio recordings of open meetings with employees this summer, Mr. Zuckerberg can be heard saying that the company would sue if Ms. Warren were to enact the plan as president. \u201cIf she gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge,\u201d he said. \u201cDoes that still suck for us? Yeah. I mean, I don\u2019t want to have a major lawsuit against our own government. That\u2019s not like the position you want to be in. We care about our country and want to work with our government to do good things,\u201d he added. \u201cBut look, at the end of the day, if someone\u2019s going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight.\u201d Shortly after The Verge published Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s remarks, Ms. Warren responded by renewing her criticism of Facebook. \u201cWhat would really \u2018suck,\u2019\u201d she said, mimicking Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s language, \u201cis if we don\u2019t fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights, and repeatedly fumble their responsibility to protect our democracy.\u201d The surfacing of grievances between Ms. Warren and Mr. Zuckerberg has the effect of publicly pitting one of the leading Democratic candidates for president against the head of the world\u2019s largest social network, at a time when Silicon Valley in general and Facebook in particular continue to be scrutinized for their efforts to combat disinformation and prevent election interference in 2020 and beyond. In the audio recording clipped and published by The Verge, Mr. Zuckerberg ties his criticism of Ms. Warren\u2019s plan to concerns about election interference. \u201cIt\u2019s just that breaking up these companies, whether it\u2019s Facebook or Google or Amazon, is not actually going to solve the issues,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, you know, it doesn\u2019t make election interference less likely. It makes it more likely because now the companies can\u2019t coordinate and work together.\u201d After the leaked audio was published and Ms. Warren responded, Mr. Zuckerberg commented on the episode in a Facebook post. \u201cEvery week I do a Q&A at Facebook where employees get to ask me anything and I share openly what I\u2019m thinking on all kinds of projects and issues,\u201d he said. \u201cThe transcript from one of my Q&As a few months ago just got published online \u2014 and even though it was meant to be internal rather than public, now that it\u2019s out there, you can check it out if you\u2019re interested in seeing an unfiltered version of what I\u2019m thinking and telling employees on a bunch of topics.\u201d Ms. Warren, meanwhile, used the renewed focus on the issue as an opportunity to reiterate that she is \u201cnot afraid to hold Big Tech companies like Facebook, Google, and Amazon accountable.\u201d In her proposal, Ms. Warren argues that the tech giants have essentially developed monopolies \u2014 they have \u201cbulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else.\u201d Her plan calls for legislation that would prohibit platforms like Amazon from both offering a marketplace for commerce and participating in that marketplace; appointing regulators to undo some tech mergers; and rolling back some acquisitions by tech giants, such as Facebook\u2019s deals for WhatsApp and Instagram. Later Tuesday, she pressed the issue, firing off a five-tweet thread that began: \u201cLet\u2019s talk a bit about my plan to #BreakUpBigTech and why it\u2019s got Mark Zuckerberg so worked up.\u201d \u201cFacebook is doing pretty well right now,\u201d Ms. Warren said, citing its acquisitions as evidence that tech companies had amassed significant power and face little competition. \u201cImagine Facebook and Instagram trying to outdo each other to protect your privacy and keep misinformation out of your feed, instead of working together to sell your data, inundate you with misinformation, and undermine our election security,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we need to #BreakUpBigTech.\u201d By offering a steady diet of detailed policy proposals, Ms. Warren has grown her following significantly and risen to the top of the polls. Her plans to reshape the government extend to areas like the economy and education, where she has called for a wealth tax and canceling student loan debt. \u201cWe have these giant corporations \u2014 do I have to tell that to people in Long Island City? \u2014 that think they can roll over everyone,\u201d Ms. Warren told a crowd there earlier this year, after Amazon pulled out of plans to build a new campus in the neighborhood. \u201cI\u2019m sick of freeloading billionaires.\u201d",

      "content": " For months, Senator Bernie Sanders brushed off questions about his age, offering a simple, six-word mantra to those who doubt he\u2019s energetic enough to run for president: \u201cFollow me around the campaign trail.\u201d But in the hours before the chest pains that led to an emergency procedure in a Las Vegas hospital, Mr. Sanders, 78, uttered a different, perhaps more telling, series of six words. \u201cGet me a chair up here,\u201d he said, turning to his deputy campaign manager on Tuesday, before sitting down in front of the crowd of 250 gathered for a fund-raiser in a Persian restaurant. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long day here.\u201d For months, Democrats have watched as a trio of septuagenarians commanded a majority of support in their crowded primary field: Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., 76, Senator Elizabeth Warren, 70, and Mr. Sanders, have consistently led in the contest to face President Trump, 73, next year. Presidential campaigns always reflect the hopes and fears \u2014 or, as political strategists call them, the \u201ckitchen table conversations\u201d \u2014 of the voters who cast the ballots. And this year, along with health care costs and college affordability, stagnant wages and immigration, the contest also reflects another issue, one that strikes at the heart of a country where the highest share of the electorate will be older than 65 since at least 1970: How old is too old? Voters, who have watched candidates through debate stages and state party dinners, on sweaty stages and speed-walking across the state fair, corn dog in hand, do not generally want to say there is a ceiling. No one is too old to be doing this. They just are not sure they would want to be keeping up such a rigorous schedule in their 70s. Would you? Gerontologists and other experts in aging say there is simply no way to definitively address the question of an upper age limit on the rigors of the presidency. \u201cThere\u2019s no answer. It\u2019s unknowable,\u201d said Dr. Mark Lachs, co-chief of Geriatric and Palliative Medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian. \u201cIt\u2019s true that rates of physical and cognitive impairment are age dependent but there\u2019s all kind of variability.\u201d The averages paint a sobering picture: The average life expectancy in the United States is just under 79, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Even as Americans live longer than ever before, about 85 percent of older adults have at least one chronic disease, and more than three-quarters have at least two. But despite the statistics, one person\u2019s 70 can be another\u2019s 60, Dr. Lachs said. And being 70 years old, he added, is not at all what it used to be. \u201cThe yardstick gets moved every decade because the country is aging and medical care becomes better,\u201d he said. \u201cAge should not be a disqualification for the presidency.\u201d That\u2019s a message some voters happily believe, as they confront the realities of aging in their own lives. The number of Americans who plan to retire after age 66 has steadily ticked up over the past quarter century, with a quarter saying they do not plan to retire at all. \u201cSeventy is the new fifty,\u201d said Halliestine Zimmerman, a retired accountant from Greenville, S.C., who celebrated her 70th birthday in June, a week before Ms. Warren did. \u201cYou don\u2019t really think I am at the end of my life span, you think more you are in the middle. I know what it is I want out of my life, and you know how to get it.\u201d Ms. Zimmerman\u2019s husband, whose age she would only give as \u201c70 plus,\u201d had a triple bypass several years ago and today he regularly plays tennis. \u201cHe\u2019s doing fantastic, so a stent doesn\u2019t bother me at all,\u201d she said, of Mr. Sanders. \u201cI don\u2019t think he will stop campaigning, I don\u2019t think he should \u2014 remember a lot of people don\u2019t make it to his age.\u201d But others worry that an older commander-in-chief would share the declines they have experienced in their own physical and mental abilities over the years. Discussions of aging have been all-but-inescapable on the campaign trail. Since he entered the race, Mr. Biden has been dogged by questions about his physical fitness and condition \u2014 concerns he has tried to alleviate by bounding through parade routes and shaking dozens of hands in steamy summer weather. Mr. Sanders keeps a blistering campaign schedule that often includes multiple events in multiple cities each day. And supporters of Ms. Warren gush about her vitality, bragging about the hundreds of selfies she takes with supporters after each appearance. \u201cI was just amazed that when you first came out here, Senator Warren, that you ran up those steps the way that you did, and all this energy and stamina that you have,\u201d Nikita L. Jackson, a Rock Hill, S.C., city councilwoman, said as she praised Ms. Warren to a crowd at a town hall event on Saturday. None of the Democratic candidates have been particularly eager to delve into the details of their health. Aides to Mr. Sanders released a brief statement noting that he \u201cwas found to have a blockage in one artery and two stents were successfully inserted,\u201d a fairly common procedure in the United States. Like his rivals, Mr. Sanders has not yet released his medical records, though all three have vowed to do so before the Iowa caucuses in February. With little actual medical information, even minor irregularities in how candidates appear have prompted a flurry of age-related speculation. When Mr. Sanders hit his head on the edge of a glass shower door, his campaign explained that he had received a cut requiring stitches but stressed that he did not fall. Mr. Biden appeared to be moving his mouth in a strange fashion during the last debate, which led to questions about whether he wore dentures. At Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign events, voters question whether his verbal missteps can be attributed to his age. \u201cHe\u2019s not as sharp as he might be,\u201d said Carol Sobelson, 63, at a campaign event in Concord, N.H. \u201cHe\u2019s done a lot for our country, he was a great vice president. He\u2019s probably not my first choice.\u201d Health, or the perception of a candidate\u2019s health, is unlikely to be off the table in a campaign against Mr. Trump. In 2016, his supporters spliced together video footage of Hillary Clinton coughing and Mr. Trump often questioned her stamina, particularly after she abruptly left a ceremony in New York honoring the 15th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks. Already, Mr. Trump has started questioning Mr. Biden\u2019s energy levels, nicknaming him \u201cSleepy Joe.\u201d Nearly all Democrats prefer candidates in their 40s through 60s, according to surveys. When asked about the ideal age for a president, just 3 percent said the 70s, according to polling released by Pew Research Center in May. Other polls have shown that Americans express more discomfort with a candidate in their 70s than one who is gay, Muslim or an independent. The two Democratic nominees who have won the White House since 1992 \u2014 Bill Clinton and Barack Obama \u2014 made generational change a key part of their winning campaign message. Both were the youngest in their primary fields.",

      "author": "Matt Stevens",
      "content": "  It was another busy week in Washington and on the campaign trail. Here is our quick rundown of what happened in the 2020 race. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont had a heart attack this week, and doctors inserted two stents to open a blocked artery. Mr. Sanders, 78, was taken to a Las Vegas hospital on Wednesday after he experienced \u201csome chest discomfort\u201d at an event Tuesday night. His wife, Jane Sanders, later said that he was resting comfortably and that he would participate in the next Democratic debate, on Oct. 15. The news that he\u2019d had a heart attack was not revealed until he was discharged from the hospital on Friday. The end of the third fiscal quarter was Monday, and candidates have started announcing their fund-raising totals for July, August and September. We\u2019re tracking the numbers here. Our colleague Reid J. Epstein wrote about the last-minute email scramble for donations. (Meet our goal! Save the kittens!) Here\u2019s where some of the candidates ended up: President Trump\u2019s re-election campaign and the Republican National Committee raised a combined $125 million in the third quarter. Of course, the numbers aren\u2019t directly comparable to the Democratic hauls, since each donor can give hundreds of thousands of dollars to the R.N.C., but only $5,600 to an individual candidate. On Wednesday, Mr. Biden delivered his most forceful response yet to Mr. Trump\u2019s requests that foreign countries investigate unsubstantiated allegations about him and his son Hunter. He accused the Trump team of trying to use \u201clies, smears, distortions and name calling\u201d to knock him out of the presidential race. Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign also contacted television anchors and networks on Sunday to \u201cdemand\u201d that Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, be kept off the air for promoting \u201cfalse, debunked conspiracy theories.\u201d Ms. Harris, for her part, called (in a tweet and more formally in a letter) on Twitter to suspend Mr. Trump\u2019s account for what she said was harassment of the whistle-blower, a violation of the platform\u2019s terms of service. It\u2019s official: The next Democratic debate will feature a dozen candidates onstage at once. As we\u2019ve mentioned before, the Oct. 15 debate in Ohio will feature the 10 candidates who appeared at last month\u2019s event as well as Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii and Tom Steyer, the former hedge fund investor. In the world of not-so-surprising news, we learned on Tuesday that Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, is not a fan of Ms. Warren\u2019s plan to \u201cbreak up big tech.\u201d \u201cIf she gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg told Facebook employees, according to recordings leaked to The Verge. Suffice it to say, there were more remarks where those came from, and Ms. Warren offered some of her own: Facebook, she said, had repeatedly fumbled its \u201cresponsibility to protect our democracy.\u201d Nine of the 2020 candidates appeared at a gun policy forum in Las Vegas on Wednesday, two years and one day after a gunman massacred 58 concertgoers there, and expressed their collective support for sweeping new gun restrictions. Gun control once splintered Democrats along regional and ideological lines, but the party is increasingly unified around an assault weapons ban, gun licensing and other measures. Before the event, both Mr. Biden (who participated) and Mr. Steyer (who wasn\u2019t invited) released gun control plans. On Monday, Mr. Sanders unveiled another proposal aimed at reducing income inequality: a corporate tax that would penalize the country\u2019s largest companies if they don\u2019t narrow the gap between what they pay their top executives and what they pay their workers. Two days later, Ms. Warren outlined a new tax on \u201cexcessive lobbying,\u201d which would apply to corporations and trade organizations that spend more than $500,000 a year lobbying the government. When \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d does an entire skit on a Democratic debate, all the time you\u2019ve spent trying to keep up with this clown-car primary can suddenly seem worth it. Enjoy the \u201ccorn pop\u201d story, Maya Rudolph\u2019s portrayal of Ms. Harris, and this very good tweet from Ms. Harris herself.",

Biden Jr. is increasingly dependent on his top donors, many of whom met in Philadelphia.By Shane GoldmacherPRINT EDITIONWith Biden Under Attack, Big-Money Donors Gather to Plot Fortifications|October 7, 2019, Page A20",
      "author": "Shane Goldmacher",
      "content": " PHILADELPHIA \u2014 Leading donors for Joseph R. Biden Jr. convened this weekend for their first donor retreat since he announced his candidacy and struck a determined posture as Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign found itself under assault from President Trump, losing its clear front-runner status and lapped in the money chase by multiple Democratic rivals, most notably Senator Elizabeth Warren. Over cocktails on Friday evening and a Saturday spent in a drab hotel conference room, Mr. Biden\u2019s top financiers and fund-raisers received strategy briefings and PowerPoint presentations, and plotted the path forward for the former vice president, who suddenly found himself in fourth place in the money chase. Only hours before the gathering began, the news broke that Ms. Warren, now seen as Mr. Biden\u2019s chief rival, had out-raised him in the last three months by nearly $10 million \u2014 $24.6 million to $15.2 million. He lagged behind Senator Bernie Sanders ($25.3 million) and Mayor Pete Buttigieg ($19.1 million), too. While some were downbeat about the financial figures, Mr. Biden\u2019s slip in the polls and the onslaught from Mr. Trump, the Biden loyalists described a sense of almost burden and responsibility. If Mr. Biden is to compete financially with the online windfalls of Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren, several donors said, they believe it would be on the shoulders of the bundlers assembled here. \u201cAll of us realize that Joe Biden does not have the online fund-raising capability of a Warren. Warren has been doing it longer than him. Sanders has been doing it longer than him,\u201d said Dick Harpootlian, a prominent South Carolina supporter who hosted a fund-raiser for Mr. Biden in May. [Which Democrats are leading the 2020 presidential race this week?] Denise Bauer, a former ambassador to Belgium, said there was an urgency in the air. \u201cWe need him to get the nomination because he\u2019s the one who can win,\u201d she said, adding \u201cWe are all going to try to raise every single dollar we can.\u201d Some donors played down the importance of the very currency that had brought them to Philadelphia in the first place for what the campaign called a \u201cfinance committee forum,\u201d questioning, for instance, whether Mr. Buttigieg and Mr. Sanders had the other political assets needed to seriously challenge Mr. Biden. In a sign of the attendees\u2019 significant financial firepower, Mr. Biden himself addressed the several dozen donors who came to the retreat on Saturday, rallying them for 45 minutes about the months ahead, people there said. The campaign kept the session with Mr. Biden behind closed doors, despite pledging to open his fund-raising events to reporters. The campaign said this event with Mr. Biden\u2019s biggest bundlers was different because no money was actually raised. On Friday afternoon, the donors received a tour of Mr. Biden\u2019s downtown Philadelphia office before decamping to the second floor of The Continental Mid-town, a retro-style bar a few blocks away where they sported shiny \u201cJoe 2020\u201d pins and sipped from an open bar. On Saturday, there were a series of closed-door briefings, with updates from most of Mr. Biden\u2019s top brass, including his campaign manager, Greg Schultz, and former chief of staff as vice president, Steve Ricchetti, about the run-up to the Iowa caucuses through Super Tuesday, including delegate math and digital tactics, according to attendees, who were asked to keep the proceedings private. Multiple attendees said Ms. Warren was, by far, Mr. Biden\u2019s most discussed opponent, with his strategists telling donors they expected her to come under new press scrutiny now that she has risen in the polls. Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren, who refuse to hold traditional fund-raisers or coddle members of the contributor class like those gathered in Philadelphia, have raced ahead of Mr. Biden in fund-raising by attracting hundreds of thousands of small donors online. Ms. Warren had 940,000 donations in the last three months; Mr. Sanders had 1.4 million; Mr. Biden, who sharply cut back digital spending in August, has not disclosed his total number of donations. Some contributors played down the significance of money in a race flooded by free news media attention, and for a candidate like Mr. Biden whose reputation has been established after more than a decade in the national spotlight. [Keep up with the 2020 field with our candidate tracker.] \u201cHow is money working out for Sanders and Mayor Pete?\u201d asked John Morgan, a lawyer and top Biden fund-raiser in Florida who has hosted the former vice president at his home but who did not attend the summit. \u201cJoe has more than plenty.\u201d Donors were also shown Mr. Biden\u2019s latest ads; the campaign had announced a $6 million television and digital ad purchase on Thursday in the four early voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. The summit comes less than four months before the opening Iowa caucuses. And it comes as Mr. Trump has relentlessly attacked Mr. Biden, soliciting the assistance of foreign nations to investigate him, his son Hunter and his business deals, sparking an impeachment inquiry in the House of Representatives. Donors, many of whom spoke on condition of anonymity, were on edge about how the impeachment proceedings would play out. Would Mr. Trump\u2019s focus on Mr. Biden end up helping him by making it appear that Mr. Trump fears him? Or would Mr. Trump\u2019s barrage \u2014 including on the airwaves in early states \u2014 and the president\u2019s singular ability to command attention irreparably wound Mr. Biden in the mind of primary voters? \u201cHe\u2019s running a primary campaign and a general at the same time and I think he\u2019s doing a great job,\u201d said Sheila Nix, a former chief of staff to Dr. Jill Biden, who attended the forum. \u201cIt\u2019s a little unprecedented having to do both at the same time.\u201d Biden campaign officials  said that they had always expected the primary race to tighten, it was just a matter of who would emerge as their strongest opponent. Still, the reality began to sink in for the assembled donors: Mr. Biden is likely to be outspent in the coming months. Unlike his two leading rivals, Mr. Biden did not disclose a cash-on-hand total. Mr. Sanders had $33.7 million in the bank. Ms. Warren has $25.7 million. Mr. Biden is expected to report only a fraction of that. Even if he had spent zero dollars since July 1 \u2014 and he has spent millions \u2014 his cash on hand would be less than Mr. Sanders\u2019s or Ms. Warren\u2019s. Mr. Biden spent $5 million in both May and June, the most recent months that federal records are available. His staff and campaign costs have only ballooned since then, suggesting he likely spent nearly all, if not more than, the $15.2 million he raised in the last three months. As the race has narrowed to only three candidates polling consistently above single digits \u2014 Mr. Biden, Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders \u2014 some see an opportunity for Mr. Biden to consolidate a donor class that is typically more moderate than the grass-roots donors powering the Warren and Sanders campaigns. Mr. Buttigieg and Senators Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey have been the chief competitors for bundler loyalty. But Mr. Biden\u2019s uneven performances on the stump and the debates have slowed such movement. During the last debate, a group of Democratic donors gathered for a private event in Manhattan with the strategists James Carville and Paul Begala providing color commentary. When Mr. Biden went on his discursive and meandering answer that invoked a record-player, there were audible groans, and some people threw their arms in the air in frustration, according to an attendee. In an interview, Mr. Carville said Mr. Trump\u2019s recent \u201cobsession\u201d with Mr. Biden made the former vice president\u2019s electability case better than anyone else could. \u201cI think Biden has been given a lifeline here,\u201d Mr. Carville said. \u201cI hope he takes it.\u201d Among the ads attendees were shown was a new one from Friday in which Mr. Biden accused Mr. Trump of trying to \u201cchoose the Democratic candidate.\u201d For all the incoming Mr. Biden has taken \u2014 from his rivals, from the White House and from, as his campaign likes to point out, the news media \u2014 his advisers believe his continued perch atop many polls proves his resilience, no matter his shrinking lead. \u201cI always come away from things with him thinking I\u2019ve got to work harder. I need to do more,\u201d Ms. Bauer said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t ask for that. He inspires that.\u201d",

      "author": "Thomas Kaplan",
      "content": " LOS ANGELES \u2014 With Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s announcement on Friday that she raised $24.6 million in the past three months, the fund-raising picture for the leading Democratic presidential contenders has come into focus: Ms. Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders are in strong position to fund their campaigns over the long haul. Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders, whose campaign announced raising $25.3 million in the third quarter, both brought in more money than they had in the previous quarter, while money totals were down for two of their top competitors, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. Ms. Warren\u2019s total also offers further evidence of her steady rise to the top of the pack in the Democratic primary race, where she now rivals Mr. Biden as a leading contender for the nomination. And while Mr. Sanders trails both of them in recent polls, he has a loyal following that has supported him with millions of small donations this year, ensuring that he is well positioned for a primary season that could stretch through next spring. More broadly, the fund-raising totals show the collective enthusiasm in the party for progressive candidates pushing messages of sweeping change. And they demonstrate the undeniable power of online donors in the primary. Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders have sworn off courting wealthy donors and holding elite fund-raising events, while Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg \u2014 who raised $15.2 million and $19.1 million in the quarter, according to their campaigns \u2014 both pursue money from big donors. The fund-raising hauls by Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren show that there is \u201cstrength and power to their ideas that they\u2019re putting forward, and people are engaged,\u201d said Karen Finney, a Democratic strategist who was a senior adviser for Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign. \u201cI think for anybody else in the race, you have to pay attention to that \u2014 that there is energy around some of these big ideas that represent bigger changes,\u201d she said. Mr. Biden\u2019s total did little to bolster his status in the race. Already under siege from President Trump and no longer enjoying a clear lead over the rest of the field in national polls, Mr. Biden saw his fund-raising drop roughly 30 percent from the previous quarter. Mr. Sanders exceeded Mr. Biden\u2019s total by about $10 million and Ms. Warren exceeded it by more than $9 million \u2014 an indicator of the gulf between Mr. Biden and his two progressive rivals in attracting grass-roots support. And for the second consecutive quarter, Mr. Biden, a two-term vice president who previously served in the Senate for 36 years, was bested by Mr. Buttigieg, the mayor of the fourth most populous city in the 17th most populous state. Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign said on Friday that it had received 943,000 donations in the third quarter from 509,000 donors, and more than 300,000 of those donors gave to her presidential campaign for the first time. The average donation was $26, and Ms. Warren ended the quarter with $25.7 million in cash on hand, according to her campaign. \u201cPlease take a moment to be proud of the movement you\u2019re helping build,\u201d Roger Lau, Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign manager, wrote in an email to supporters. \u201cClose your eyes and picture Wall Street bankers scowling into their catered breakfast,\u201d he suggested. Collecting small contributions from a vast group of donors comes with a huge long-term advantage: Those donors can keep giving again and again as the campaign goes on. That is not the case for wealthy donors writing $2,800 checks to candidates \u2014 the maximum an individual can give to a campaign for the primary race. Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders \u201care breaking these old political models in which rich donors can capture and control political parties,\u201d said Stephanie Taylor, a co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which is supporting Ms. Warren. \u201cThis is just a really revolutionary, seismic shift in American politics.\u201d Beating Mr. Sanders\u2019s total for the past three months would have given another jolt of momentum to Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign. Instead, Mr. Sanders\u2019s status as the top fund-raiser for the quarter provides a reminder of his sizable base of support, even as other indicators like polling are less favorable. In the long run, Mr. Sanders\u2019s slight financial edge over Ms. Warren in the quarter is unlikely to make a major difference in the perceptions of their candidacies. Mr. Sanders entered the race having already established an enormous network of donors during his 2016 presidential campaign, and he raised slightly less in the third quarter of 2019 than he did during the same time period in 2015. \u201cThe biggest takeaway is that Warren is on a roll,\u201d said Stephanie Cutter, a Democratic strategist and veteran of past presidential campaigns. \u201cShe\u2019s got wind at her back. It\u2019s evident in her polls, her fund-raising and the energy at her events.\u201d Among other candidates who have disclosed their fund-raising for the third quarter, Senator Kamala Harris raised $11.6 million, Andrew Yang raised more than $10 million and Senator Cory Booker raised more than $6 million, according to their campaigns. Presidential candidates must report their fund-raising for the quarter, which covered July through September, to the Federal Election Commission by Oct. 15. Ms. Warren struggled with fund-raising at the beginning of her campaign, but those struggles ended up being short-lived. Her third-quarter haul is another validation of her strategy to rely on online donors to finance her campaign. That choice is central to her bid for the presidency, freeing up her schedule and creating a tidy contrast with some of her rivals: While other candidates gather with rich donors, Ms. Warren spends hours taking pictures with voters who wait in the \u201cselfie line\u201d at her town-hall-style events. \u201cI made the decision early on I was not going to spend my time behind closed doors with corporate executives and bazillionaires,\u201d Ms. Warren told the crowd at a town hall in Carson City, Nev., on Wednesday night. \u201cI was going to spend my time here.\u201d At a town hall in San Diego on Thursday night, she reached her latest selfie-related milestone: She has now taken pictures with an estimated 70,000 people since beginning her campaign. She made it to the end of the selfie line just before midnight.",

At Least Some of Them.Elizabeth Warren is seeking to find a balance \u2014 disavowing fund-raisers with wealthy contributors while promising not to actually disarm in a potential matchup with President Trump.By Shane GoldmacherPRINT EDITIONWarren Will Avoid Big Fund-Raisers if Nominated, With Some Caveats|October 10, 2019, Page A15",
      "author": "Shane Goldmacher",
      "content": " As Senator Elizabeth Warren has surged toward the top of the Democratic presidential field, she has found herself torn between two competing imperatives: maintaining her perceived purity from the influence of wealthy contributors and not ceding any financial advantage to President Trump, who is busy breaking fund-raising records. One of the centerpieces of Ms. Warren\u2019s anti-corruption message has been her pledge to forgo traditional big-money fund-raisers, which advisers believe has helped fuel her rise. From the start, Ms. Warren had said the ban only applied to the primary. \u201cI do not believe in unilateral disarmament,\u201d she said when she announced it in February on MSNBC. But in a reversal, she told CBS News in an interview posted late Tuesday evening that she would extend the pledge through the general election if she were to win the Democratic nomination. \u201cLook, for me this is pretty straightforward,\u201d Ms. Warren said. \u201cEither you think democracy works and electing a president is all about going behind closed doors with bazillionaires and corporate executives and lobbyists and scooping up as much money as possible. Or you think it\u2019s about a grass-roots, let\u2019s build this from the ground up.\u201d Pressed on whether that was her position \u201cno matter how much money Donald Trump is raising,\u201d Ms. Warren replied: \u201cYeah, I\u2019m not going to do the big-dollar fund-raisers. I\u2019m just not going to do it. The whole notion behind this campaign is that we can build this together.\u201d Her aides confirmed the decision on Wednesday but layered on some caveats: While she would forgo fund-raisers for her campaign, she would headline open press events for the Democratic National Committee, which has traditionally served as a virtual extension of the nominee. Her spokeswoman, Kristen Orthman, said Ms. Warren was committed to helping Democrats \u201cup and down the ballot.\u201d Powered by small donors, Ms. Warren has become one of the strongest Democratic fund-raisers of the 2020 field, raising $24.6 million in the last three months from more than 940,000 donations, second only to Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who raised $25.3 million. Ms. Warren\u2019s new position on general election fund-raisers appears to be an effort to thread the needle between those on the progressive left urging her to permanently swear off soliciting big checks and Democratic officials and activists concerned that such a stand would endanger the party as Mr. Trump and the Republicans bank record sums of cash. Veterans of Democratic politics said the idea that fund-raising operations for the party nominee and the party itself would be completely independent was strained. \u201cOnce you are the Democratic nominee, you are the party,\u201d said Rufus Gifford, a former finance director for President Barack Obama, who has donated to multiple 2020 candidates but not to Ms. Warren. \u201cYou own the party. Your political operation takes over the D.N.C. You cannot divorce in any way fund-raising for the presidential campaign and the Democratic Party.\u201d The donation limits for the D.N.C. are actually far higher than those for direct contributions to campaigns. The D.N.C. can raise money in increments of $355,000; direct donations to a potential Warren general election committee would be limited to $2,800. Ms. Orthman said Ms. Warren would attend D.N.C. events that are open to the press to \u201cmake sure the Democratic National Committee, state and local parties, and Democratic candidates everywhere have the resources\u201d they need. She also said Ms. Warren was \u201cnot going to change a thing in how she runs her campaign,\u201d including \u201cno special access or call time with rich donors or big-dollar fund-raisers.\u201d Ms. Warren headlined a D.N.C. event in August, but she did not meet privately with large donors who attended. She is scheduled for another D.N.C. event next week. The Warren campaign declined to say whether it would create a joint fund-raising committee with the D.N.C., which is traditionally a big lure for contributors who want to support candidates up and down the ballot. Mr. Trump and his shared committees with the Republican National Committee raised $125 million in the last three months. Henry R. Munoz III, who stepped down as finance chair of the D.N.C. earlier this year and has co-hosted a fund-raiser for former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., said Ms. Warren\u2019s proposed arrangement left him confused. \u201cI don\u2019t even know how that would work,\u201d Mr. Munoz said. Democrats, he added, \u201chave to do everything in their power to work together to create an infrastructure to do battle with the almost unlimited resources that this administration and that party will use to destroy what we believe in.\u201d Beyond the party itself, an array of Democratic super PACs are gearing up for 2020. Guy Cecil, the chairman of the biggest such group in the presidential race, Priorities USA, wrote on Twitter that regardless of Ms. Warren\u2019s decision, it was \u201cfull speed ahead.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re already up & running ads holding Trump accountable in key states & will be through November next year,\u201d Mr. Cecil wrote. Ms. Warren has steadily risen in the polls throughout the year and has recently topped Mr. Biden in some surveys both nationally and in the early-voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire. Previously, she had been clear that her ban on fund-raisers applied only to the primary. MSNBC\u2019s Chris Hayes asked her that directly when she announced it (\u201cYes,\u201d Ms. Warren replied). And in an interview with The New York Times over the summer, Ms. Warren said, \u201cIt\u2019s primaries. This is Democrat against Democrat. I don\u2019t believe in unilateral disarmament.\u201d Some of her rivals had sought to portray her stance as inconsistent. \u201cBernie is proud to be the only candidate running to defeat Donald Trump who is 100 percent funded by grass-roots donations \u2014 both in the primary and in the general,\u201d Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, said pointedly when announcing his campaign\u2019s quarterly financial haul. There has also been grumbling about the $10 million in leftover Senate funds she seeded her presidential campaign with, some of which was raised from major contributors. Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders are the only two Democrats to skip traditional fund-raising events in the primary, where candidates can collect checks of up to $2,800. Her announcement this week could appeal to more fervent supporters of Mr. Sanders, whose base Ms. Warren has been seeking to win over. Tension over how candidates raise their money is an age-old political issue. In the 2016 race, Mr. Trump railed against the influence of big donors in the Republican primary. But once he became the nominee, he quickly embraced the donor world. At the time, he said he did not see a contradiction. \u201cNo,\u201d Mr. Trump said then, \u201cbecause I\u2019m raising money for the party.\u201d",

      "author": "Giovanni Russonello",
      "content": " Welcome to Poll Watch, our weekly look at polling data and survey research on the candidates, voters and issues that will shape the 2020 election. After next week\u2019s Democratic debate, pundits will inevitably argue over who won and who lost, and they\u2019ll scour the polls to see if any presidential candidate has gotten a \u201cbump\u201d in support. But as high-profile as they are, debates rarely help a candidate break out of a crowded field. And strategists generally agree that post-debate spikes in the polls seldom last for long. A dozen candidates will be onstage at the CNN/New York Times debate on Tuesday, but experts broadly agree that none of them are likely to see a significant change in fortunes in a single night. Ahead of the 2016 Republican primaries, Donald J. Trump\u2019s publicity-heavy campaign rolled along with impregnable strength, despite the fact that TV viewers rarely gave him high marks for his debate performances. The current Democratic race has been characterized by a similar steadiness, experts say, with former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. continuing to command the support of around a quarter of Democratic respondents, and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts rising consistently and sometimes surpassing him. \u201cDemocratic primary voters basically seem to be fine with their top three options,\u201d said Sean McElwee, a co-founder of the polling and analytics firm Data for Progress, referring to Mr. Biden, Ms. Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. \u201cThere\u2019s the possibility that a debate would drive a news cycle that would bolster a candidate,\u201d Mr. McElwee added. \u201cBut instead, what we\u2019ve seen is that those sorts of moments tend to fall off.\u201d Senator Kamala Harris of California is the only Democratic candidate this cycle who has seen a statistically significant jolt in the polls after a debate. At the first round of Democratic debates in late June, she confronted Mr. Biden on his past opposition to federally mandated school busing. She immediately leapt up in the polls, enjoying double-digit support among primary voters nationwide throughout July. Perhaps more important, the exchange gave her fund-raising operation a shot of adrenaline: Just 24 hours after the debate, she had raised $2 million. But she soon fell from the race\u2019s top tier, and has not broken into the double digits in any major national poll since the start of August. Mr. McElwee cited recent studies showing that candidates\u2019 success is strongly driven by the sheer amount of news coverage they manage to receive \u2014 an argument that was borne out by the success of Mr. Trump in the run-up to the 2016 primaries, when he was able to reverse the unfavorable opinions that most Republican voters held of him, not by changing the tenor of his campaign, but by securing almost nonstop coverage. \u201cThere are lots of different earned-media opportunities in the current climate \u2014 and debates are very important,\u201d Mr. McElwee said. \u201cBut if you look at the polling, there\u2019s been lots of people who have had good debates, bad debates, and at the end of the day, it hasn\u2019t really changed the broad structure of the race.\u201d \u201cIn the broad scope of cable news coverage, the one hit per month of the debate is not enough to make a candidate break through,\u201d he added. The Democratic pollster Celinda Lake said that debates can help drive future coverage, resulting in a snowball effect. But she added that candidates\u2019 fortunes will largely be determined on the ground in early-voting states. \u201cI think that honestly, the debates are having more impact on news coverage than they are having impact on voters,\u201d Ms. Lake said. \u201cCandidates don\u2019t get known by unveiling a good plan at the debate. They become known by immersing themselves in these early states.\u201d To qualify for November\u2019s debate, candidates will need to reach 5 percent support in two polls in early nominating states, or 3 percent in four early-state or national polls. These are higher thresholds than for any debate thus far. A bump after next week\u2019s debate could, at the very least, help candidates such as Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota or the former housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro \u2014 who are now foundering in the low single digits \u2014 secure a spot onstage next month. But historically, early debates have been more likely to disqualify a candidate than to provide a lasting jolt of momentum. In 2011, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas pledged in an early debate to eliminate three agencies from the executive branch if elected president but couldn\u2019t remember the name of one of the agencies. He never recovered from the flub. (When Mr. Trump became president, however, Mr. Perry was chosen to head the Department of Energy, the very agency he had forgotten to name.) Last election cycle, the businesswoman Carly Fiorina enjoyed a strong showing in the second Republican primary debate, seeing a sizable uptick in support in the days afterward. But she could not convert it into a consistent climb in the polls. \u201cSuccessful first debate performances create buzz for a candidate but also generate expectations for continued success,\u201d the historian and presidential scholar Bruce Buchanan wrote in an email. \u201cIf he or she does O.K. but less well in the second debate, the story is about underperformance.\u201d Bob Shrum, a Democratic strategist and speechwriter, said that Ms. Warren had found success by performing strongly in debates \u2014 while not chasing a breakout moment. \u201cShe has done this by performing consistently well by not looking for a cute line, and my guess is that she\u2019ll continue that,\u201d he said. But Mr. Shrum noted that as the field of candidates narrows, and the remaining candidates each get more airtime, the opportunity for news-making moments will increase. \u201cThese early debates are more like skirmishes,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re now getting into the later debates \u2014 and they can have an impact.\u201d It may not be until the general election that the debate stage once again assumes prime importance. \u201cPrimary debates are more like a beauty contest or a cameo appearance in a play,\u201d Peter Hart, a longtime Democratic pollster, said. \u201cIt gives you a glimpse, it gives you an insight, and it allows a candidate to get noticed. More importantly, it can eliminate a candidate\u2019s potential to be the nominee.\u201d On the other hand, he said, \u201cgeneral election debates have a huge impact upon the dynamics of the election \u2014 and the outcome.\u201d",

      "author": "Alexander Burns",
      "content": " With a crucial debate looming next week in the Democratic presidential primary, the party\u2019s populist wing appears increasingly in control of the race \u2014 rising in the polls, stocked with cash and with only a wounded leading candidate, Joseph R. Biden Jr., standing in its way. Several slow-building trends have converged to upend the race over the last few weeks: Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s steady ascent in the polls has accelerated. Both she and Senator Bernie Sanders, a fellow progressive, have raised immense sums of money from small donors online, dominating the Democratic field and each collecting about $10 million more than Mr. Biden in the last quarter. And Mr. Biden\u2019s numbers have gradually slipped in a way that has alarmed his supporters. The race is far from over: All three of the top candidates \u2014 Ms. Warren, Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders \u2014 have a path to victory, and there is still time for longer-shot candidates to make a real run at the nomination. The CNN/New York Times debate in Ohio on Tuesday is likely to test Ms. Warren\u2019s status as an emerging front-runner, subjecting her to new criticism from her fellow Democrats on matters ranging from health care policy to trade and the role of the government in overseeing the economy. Above all, she may need to allay lingering reservations about her appeal to swing voters in the general election. And Mr. Biden signaled on Thursday night that he will come into the debate fighting. \u201cOne of the problems I\u2019m finding, I\u2019ve got to be more aggressive,\u201d he said at a fund-raiser in Los Angeles. He then used a roundabout example to explain that debate time restraints don\u2019t allow time for lengthy answers. \u201cWhen someone says, you know, you know, \u2018Are you still beating your wife?\u2019 And, and I go, \u2018I have a long explanation,\u2019 and they say, \u2018You got 30 seconds to answer.\u2019 And you say, \u2018No. And then, wait a minute, what\u2019d I just say? No, I\u2019m not still beating my wife.\u2019 But so, I\u2019ve had, I\u2019ve had some difficulties,\u201d he said. If Tuesday\u2019s debate could break in any number of directions, what may be resolved is the overall mood of Democratic primary voters, and whether they are more inclined to seek a politically cautious nominee who promises to restore normalcy in Washington, or a more confrontational standard-bearer with an ambitious and disruptive reform agenda. It is candidates in the latter category who now control the bulk of the financial might in the race, and are best positioned in most of the early primary states. Anna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster who is not aligned in the primary, said an \u201canti-establishment\u201d current had plainly taken hold, with voters rewarding candidates for defying the conventional limits of political debate and \u201cpushing boundaries in really productive ways.\u201d She pointed not only to Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders but also to former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke, who has embraced a new political identity for himself as a gun-control activist and a critic of his own party\u2019s relatively cautious platform on the issue. \u201cAcross the board, whether it\u2019s Beto talking about assault weapons or Warren and Sanders talking about Wall Street,\u201d Ms. Greenberg said, \u201cit does feel like there is a shift in the party that is kind of new.\u201d Ms. Greenberg said there was still space for Mr. Biden to run a strong campaign because of the way voters perceive his values and character. Americans, she said, believe Mr. Biden \u201ccares about people and working class people, regular people, and that\u2019s not an insignificant asset.\u201d Yet it has been Ms. Warren, rather than Mr. Biden, who has consistently gained strength. Campaigning on a message of purging corruption in Washington and restructuring the economy, Ms. Warren has closed Mr. Biden\u2019s lead in the polls every week since the beginning of the summer and is now in a position to upset him in both Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two states to vote. Mr. Biden remains a strong contender for the nomination, largely because of the support he collects from African-American voters. But he has struggled for months to articulate a clear vision for the future and has relied heavily on Democratic nostalgia for the Obama administration. In recent weeks, he has been consumed in a grisly political clash with President Trump. So far, the support Mr. Biden has lost does not seem to have gone to another moderate, like Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. Only Ms. Warren has been moving up in the national polls, suggesting either that Mr. Biden\u2019s lost supporters have defected to her camp or that they have become undecided altogether. If Ms. Warren has become the leading liberal standard-bearer, Mr. Sanders has been a steady third in national polls and his fund-raising power is likely to keep him among the most formidable competitors in the race. Yet his campaign has been grappling with the implications of Mr. Sanders\u2019s heart attack in Las Vegas last week, a medical emergency that landed him in the hospital and has kept him off the trail for days. He has sent mixed signals about his path forward, first indicating that he would scale back his campaign schedule and then defiantly reversing that suggestion. It is unclear whether Mr. Sanders\u2019s physical condition will affect his poll numbers: He has a solid base of support nationally and few other candidates believe his core followers will be easily dislodged. There is at least a new degree of uncertainty about whether he will be in a strong position to vie for liberal Democrats who have already been migrating toward Ms. Warren. Nearly all of the candidates feel pressure to do something in the Ohio debate to stop the race from becoming a contest entirely defined by a Warren-Biden rivalry, either by inflicting direct damage on Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign or by outflanking her as an alternative to Mr. Biden. The ongoing impeachment inquiry targeting Mr. Trump has only added to the pressure on the Democratic field, since the tumult in Washington is likely to leave voters with even less time to devote to reviewing underdog options. Mr. Buttigieg in particular has been moving assertively in recent weeks to position himself as a center-left alternative to both Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren, using his considerable war chest to run television ads in Iowa. Several other candidates of different ideological stripes are counting on Iowa for a breakthrough, including Senators Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Amy Klobuchar. A wild-card joining them onstage will be a new contender, Tom Steyer, a former hedge fund investor who has spent lavishly from his personal fortune to brand himself as a reform-minded outsider. For Ms. Warren, meanwhile, the debate may help reveal whether she can consolidate her gains across the Democratic Party. On Wednesday, she campaigned in South Carolina, where she has so far struggled to gain traction with the African-American voters who largely decide the primary there. To cement her status as a front-runner, she may have to win over a range of constituencies torn between their interest in her ideas and a more cautious political calculus that draws them to Mr. Biden. One of those voters is Ohio\u2019s former governor, Ted Strickland, the only Democrat to hold that office this century. Like many Democratic voters, Mr. Strickland, a populist with close ties to organized labor, said he saw Mr. Biden as the safer bet for the general election but found it hard to resist the appeal of Ms. Warren\u2019s proposals, most of all her plan for a new tax on vast private fortunes. \u201cI think there may be something to the electability issue for Mr. Biden, in Ohio,\u201d Mr. Strickland said. \u201cBut if I could just choose to put someone in the presidency \u2014 if that was my choice alone \u2014 it would be hard for me to pass up Elizabeth Warren.\u201d Mr. Strickland said he had spoken with Mr. Biden recently and saw him as a seasoned diplomat and a reliable \u201ceconomic progressive.\u201d But Ms. Warren, he said, was gradually easing voters\u2019 reservations about her ability to go up against Mr. Trump by talking about policy issues \u201cin ways that are easily understood.\u201d Mr. Biden remains a clear favorite in just one of the early states, South Carolina, and his advisers have predicted that he would fare better in larger, more diverse states that vote later in the calendar. He is counting, in particular, on older and more moderate African-American voters to hold back the party from stampeding toward a more ideological liberal candidate. In 2016, black and Latino voters helped Hillary Clinton withstand a persistent primary challenge from Mr. Sanders. Yet scattered polling in the later states has largely followed the national trend: Last week, for instance, the Public Policy Institute of California released a poll finding a statistical three-way tie in the nation\u2019s most populous state between Mr. Biden, Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders. Mark Baldassare, president of the institute, said there was no indication in his poll that the state\u2019s diversity would represent a stumbling block for candidates on the left, as Mr. Biden is hoping. The primary debates would be crucial to determining Ms. Warren\u2019s continued momentum, he said, because voters seemed to be using them for insight into the general election. \u201cIt has become kind of a proxy for: How are these candidates going to do when they stand up next to Trump?\u201d Mr. Baldassare said. \u201cI think this will be Elizabeth Warren\u2019s moment now, because if she is in the mix for front-runner, people are going to be testing her and seeing: How does she do? How does she do when she has to be on defense?\u201d",

      "content": " IOWA CITY \u2014 Oliver Hanlon was beaming ear-to-ear as he stood next to Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts on a riverside stage at the University of Iowa. \u201cI met the president,\u201d he shouted, bounding down the steps two at a time. His mother gently corrected him: \u201cNot yet,\u201d she said, while the Warren photo line snaked on behind her. Oliver couldn\u2019t be faulted for his civics proficiency; he\u2019s 7 years old. The 2020 Democratic presidential campaign stops are crawling with children, some of whom spend most of the stump speeches crawling away from their parents. While all of the candidates seek to portray a family-friendly image, it takes work to bring a youngster to a campaign event: They often start late and run well into the evening, with a policy discussion not exactly accessible on the elementary-school level; bigger rallies often take place outdoors, regardless of weather. Kissing babies and tousling children\u2019s hair has long been a staple of retail campaigning, but in 2020 it is about more than a photo op, even the cutest of photo ops. In a historically crowded field, in an era of uncertain polling, these campaign stops are something of a past-their-bedtimes straw poll, revealing which candidates young parents deem viable or famous enough to risk a tantrum or a sleep-deprived meltdown over the next morning. For now, the leaders appear to be Ms. Warren and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who have both taken steps to cater to the children and parents who come see them. It\u2019s one more subtle measure of their stature in a race that is steadily narrowing from the largest primary field in history to just a handful of viable contenders. Ms. Warren and Mr. Biden, whose staffs both go to great lengths to present their events as family friendly, are currently atop the Democratic polls, which might explain the pep talk parents often give their children before meeting the two candidates: You are talking to the next president. Ms. Warren lets families with children cut to the front of her selfie line, a strong incentive given that supporters often wait hours for a 20-second interaction and photograph. Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign stops over the summer and fall have often come with free ice cream \u2014 and if frozen dairy products are not available, he\u2019s been known to hand out cash with instructions for children to tell their parents to stop for a treat on the way home. During a Labor Day swing through Iowa, Mr. Biden worked a chocolate-and-vanilla swirl machine at one union picnic and handed out ice cream sandwiches at another. Last month in Iowa City, Clara Engler, 5, spent hours before an evening Warren rally at the University of Iowa practicing the \u201cpinkie promise\u201d that has become a staple for young girls at Ms. Warren\u2019s events. With her mother, Brooke Engler, an Iowa City cosmetologist, Clara worked on locking fingers briefly and looking up, so she could hear Ms. Warren tell her that running for president is \u201cwhat girls do.\u201d When the moment came, about a half-hour after Clara\u2019s bedtime, Ms. Warren got down on one knee, looked her in the eye and made the promise. Clara jumped up with glee. Her mother beamed. \u201cShe\u2019d seen it before on TV,\u201d Ms. Engler said. \u201cIt\u2019s nice that I can have my child sit back and watch politics without worrying about what will be said.\u201d The others in the 19-candidate Democratic field aren\u2019t overtly inhospitable to children, but former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas peppers his stump speech with profanity and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont isn\u2019t a fuzzy figure while delivering his policy-heavy stemwinders. In early September he scolded a crying baby to \u201ckeep it down\u201d during a campaign stop in New Hampshire. Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., whose most fervent supporters tend to be young enough not to have children of their own, often attracts older kids \u2014 particularly L.G.B.T. teens inspired by the first openly gay major candidate for president. \u201cWhen you know that there\u2019s something historic about your campaign, you feel a level of responsibility that goes with that,\u201d Mr. Buttigieg said aboard his Iowa campaign bus last month. \u201cIt certainly adds a level of motivation when people come up to you, sometimes with tears in their eyes, just letting you know what the fact of your campaign means to them.\u201d Even in Iowa, where rare is the weekend without a presidential hopeful stumping nearby, it takes a serious commitment and coordination to attend a campaign event with young children. \u201cIf she starts crying we\u2019ll run out quickly,\u201d Elizabeth Batey, a lawyer from Waverly, Iowa, said of her 2-year-old daughter, Hattie, while waiting for Mr. Buttigieg last month in a stuffy storefront in Iowa Falls. Ms. Batey, whose 4-month-old son, George, was asleep in his car seat, made it through Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s event without having to flee. Afterward, she waited on the sidewalk in front of the Buttigieg campaign bus, holding one child in each arm. \u201cWow, you\u2019ve got your hands full,\u201d Mr. Buttigieg told her before pausing for a picture. Parents interviewed at a range of campaign events said they often felt like this political moment resembled a tawdry reality TV show, and they brought their children to see the 2020 candidates to try to demonstrate to them that politics can be something different. \u201cI can\u2019t let my kids listen to the TV without being ready to hit the mute button,\u201d said Julia Privett, a physician assistant who brought her 2-year-old daughter, Alyssa, to see Mr. Biden talk about climate change in Cedar Rapids. Lytishya Borglum, a Cedar Falls small business owner, brought her three middle-school-aged children to see Senator Kamala Harris of California speak at the University of Northern Iowa. She\u2019d taken her oldest daughter, 13-year-old Berlyn, to see Democratic caucus campaign events in 2008, but skipped 2016 because it was too toxic. \u201cNowadays, it\u2019s impossible for them not to be exposed to the craziness in the White House,\u201d Ms. Borglum said. At Ms. Warren\u2019s Iowa City rally, a parade of children waited with their parents for a picture with the senator. Kohner Reynolds, who will turn 2 in November, blew past his 7:30 p.m. bedtime. \u201cHe fell asleep a couple times in the baby carrier,\u201d said Kohner\u2019s mother, Callie Reynolds. \u201cI wanted him to be able to say he came to see her.\u201d Burgundy Johnson, a child psychologist, kept her 5-month-old son, Archer, up past his 8 o\u2019clock bedtime. She occupied Archer with toys. \u201cI wanted a picture of Elizabeth Warren holding my baby,\u201d she said while leaving the event at 8:40 p.m. \u201cNow it\u2019s going to be an interesting night.\u201d The older children tend to be more attuned to issues. Evelynn Parlet, 11, an Iowa City sixth grader, said she approved of Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign goal of reordering the American economy. \u201cI liked what she said,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to help people who don\u2019t have enough money.\u201d Samara and Isa Murillo, sisters who are 10 and 8 years old, each had Ms. Warren autograph a white campaign placard. Ms. Warren got down on one knee and signed them on the floor of the stage. \u201cWe love her ideas about change and the two cents,\u201d Samara said. \u201cPeople out there are dying of hunger.\u201d Isa said she was more focused on climate change. \u201cSome people don\u2019t have homes because of the flooding,\u201d she said. And, because it is Iowa, there are parents who spend caucus season vying to get their children photographed with all of the candidates they can \u2014 just in case one of them makes it to the White House. Eric Heininger, a fund-raiser for nonprofit organizations, and his wife, Tiffani Milless, a physician, toted their 9-month-old daughter, Charlotte, around the Polk County Steak Fry last month to get her in pictures with as many contenders as possible. Dressed in a red-white-and-blue sundress, Charlotte met Ms. Warren, Mr. Buttigieg, Mr. O\u2019Rourke and the entrepreneur Andrew Yang. At earlier campaign events, she was photographed with Mr. Sanders, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey and former Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado, who ended his campaign in August. With Charlotte sleeping on her father\u2019s chest, Dr. Milless filled out a card committing to caucus for Mr. O\u2019Rourke and held it up while the Texan offered his toothy smile. \u201cThank you so much,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke said, gently patting the sleeping child on her back. A campaign aide took Dr. Milless\u2019s caucus card and stuffed it into a backpack. Afterward, Dr. Milless said she had only filled out the card in order to secure the picture with her daughter. \u201cHe\u2019s in my top three,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a loose commitment, kind of like a promise ring.\u201d",

      "author": "Maggie Astor",
      "content": "  Here\u2019s our rundown of what happened in the Democratic primary this week, as the candidates gear up for Tuesday\u2019s debate in Ohio. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. explicitly endorsed impeachment on Wednesday, going beyond past statements in which he had called only for an impeachment inquiry if President Trump did not cooperate with Congress. \u201cTo preserve our Constitution, our democracy, our basic integrity, he should be impeached,\u201d Mr. Biden told supporters in New Hampshire, as he accused Mr. Trump of having \u201cbetrayed this nation.\u201d It\u2019s been a whirlwind week for Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who is recovering from a heart attack. In addition to the concerns the episode raised about his health, his campaign\u2019s delay in disclosing the heart attack led to criticism about its transparency, which Mr. Sanders has forcefully rejected. Perhaps more consequentially, Mr. Sanders told reporters on Tuesday that he would be changing the \u201cnature\u201d of his campaign by doing fewer events. On Wednesday, he said he had misspoken. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts often tells voters that after she became \u201cvisibly pregnant\u201d at the end of her first year as a public-school teacher, the principal wished her luck and hired someone else to replace her. This week, a conservative news site and other outlets challenged her account, citing a 2007 interview with Ms. Warren and minutes from a school board meeting \u2014 and Ms. Warren pushed back in a unique way. Rather than just restating the truth of her account (though she has done that as well), she called on women to share their own stories of pregnancy discrimination, which remains widespread. CNN and the Human Rights Campaign hosted the latest subject-based forum of the presidential race on Thursday, focused on gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender issues. Protesters interrupted the event at several points to call attention to the murders of black transgender women, and the candidates seemed to welcome the reminder. Before the event, Ms. Warren, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and Senator Kamala Harris of California released plans on L.G.B.T.Q. equality. All three said they would fight to pass the Equality Act and ban conversion therapy as president. This week brought a deluge of new policy proposals on issues ranging from foster care to judicial ethics. The fifth presidential debate will be held in Georgia on Wednesday, Nov. 20, and the hosts will be MSNBC and The Washington Post. As previously announced, candidates will need 165,000 donors and at least 3 percent support in four qualifying polls to make the stage. (An alternative polling option is 5 percent support in two early-state polls.) Eight candidates have met those criteria so far; the latest was Andrew Yang, who did so this past week. Ms. Warren had a crowd-pleasing comeback at the CNN town hall when asked how she would respond to a supporter who said, \u201cSenator, I\u2019m old-fashioned, and my faith teaches me that marriage is between one man and one woman.\u201d Read more about the moment here.",

      "content": " Sign up here to get On Politics in your inbox. Tonight, I\u2019m writing to you from Columbus, Ohio, where The New York Times has descended in force for the biggest presidential primary debate in history. This one is particularly exciting for those of us at the paper, since The Times is co-hosting the debate with CNN and our own Marc Lacey will be one of the moderators. More on that in a minute. Tonight is also an exciting milestone for this little newsletter. Starting this week, we\u2019ll be appearing in your inbox five evenings a week. We have tons of exciting things ahead \u2014 impeachment and primaries and a general election, oh my! Sign up, forward us to your friends and get them to sign up, and as always, thanks for reading. Now, back to the debate. Tuesday night\u2019s event comes at a truly extraordinary moment in American politics. In Washington, the impeachment inquiry into President Trump is moving forward at a dizzying pace. Senator Bernie Sanders is out of the hospital, former Vice President Joe Biden is out of patience and Senator Elizabeth Warren seems out to get Facebook. With a dozen candidates stuffed onstage, there are bound to be some fireworks. Here\u2019s some of what we\u2019ll be watching: On Sunday, Mr. Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden said he would step down from his board position at a Chinese investment firm. On Monday, Mr. Biden released a government ethics plan. On Tuesday, Hunter Biden will do a major television interview. Seems as if Mr. Biden and his team want to make sure he has plenty to talk about Tuesday night when it comes to his family, ethics and Mr. Trump. The challenge for Mr. Biden will be whether he can leverage the fact that Mr. Trump now faces impeachment proceedings because of the president\u2019s efforts to collect opposition research on him and his son, without getting stuck in a morass of questions about his own family. After being hospitalized for a heart attack, Mr. Sanders, 78, needs to convince voters that he is not too old to be president. The debate signifies his return to the race: He has remained off the campaign trail since Oct. 1, when he had two stents inserted to clear a blocked artery after experiencing chest pains at a campaign event. Aides to Mr. Sanders rebuffed questions asked by my colleague Sydney Ember about whether he\u2019d be able to stand so long on a stage, but they fully realize that his energy, vibrancy and ability will be under intense scrutiny from voters. Ms. Warren\u2019s surge in the polls has finally reached the point where it has become problematic for Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders. Both men have signaled that attacks could be coming, with Mr. Sanders drawing a pretty sharp contrast over the weekend. It\u2019s likely that some of those attacks will focus on her health care plan: how she would pay for it, whether she would raise taxes on the middle class, whether she would end private insurance plans and how she would accommodate union health plans. Will Ms. Warren be ready with more polished answers than she has given in the past? Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., has the most field offices in the early states (tied with Ms. Warren) and a generous campaign bank account (only Mr. Sanders has raised more among Democrats). What he lacks is actual traction in the polls. So far, most of his debate performances have been characterized by \u201cWest Wing\u201d-style monologues. But there are signs he may pivot to a more aggressive tack Tuesday night in hopes of expanding his support. In recent weeks, he has nudged Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders on health care and has been in something of a sniper fight with former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas. There have been plenty of signs that the two young guns in the race may be headed for a shootout at the Otterbein University Corral. The question is whether that will be enough for either to make a mark. Four candidates on the stage haven\u2019t qualified for the next debate in November: the former housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Mr. O\u2019Rourke. Tuesday night is a now-or-never moment for them. Expect some fireworks \u2014 or at least an attempt to light a fuse. For Mr. Steyer, it\u2019s his first time in a primary debate. He\u2019s an actual billionaire standing onstage at a time when several candidates have built populist campaigns running against the billionaires. But he\u2019s also one of the most progressive candidates in the field on issues like climate change and impeachment. As for Ms. Gabbard, her campaign has emerged as one of the biggest mysteries of the 2020 race. After threatening last week to boycott the debate, she is now planning to appear. She could attack the entire political class, the Democratic Party and the media. Or not! No one quite knows what to expect from either one of these iconoclastic competitors. Here\u2019s our list of who has qualified for the stage. Check out our visual guide to the debate. You can also read the live chat we did today and listen to the preview conference call we did for subscribers. Tuesday, you can watch the CNN/New York Times debate with us. Join us on nytimes.com or the NYTimes app for the live video and our live chat starting at 7:30 p.m. Eastern time. (I\u2019ll be moderating! The debate itself starts at 8.) And if you happen to be in the Columbus area Tuesday evening, I\u2019ll be appearing with a panel of my New York Times colleagues to discuss what we expect to see at the debate. R.S.V.P. here. After the debate, on Wednesday, politics editor Patrick Healy, national political correspondent Jonathan Martin and politics reporter Katie Glueck will parse the standout moments. Dial in to ask your questions and discuss the takeaways from the night before. We want to hear from our readers. Have a question? We\u2019ll try to answer it. Have a comment? We\u2019re all ears. Email us at onpolitics@nytimes.com. Our National editor, Marc Lacey, has held a lot of the biggest jobs at The New York Times: White House correspondent, a foreign correspondent who has reported from dozens of countries and the editor of the weekend news report. Now, he is about to take on perhaps his highest-profile task yet \u2014 moderating the Democratic primary debate. We had some questions about that. Marc was kind enough to give us some answers. But, sadly, not the questions. So, a dozen candidates on the stage, a nonstop flood of Big Breaking News out of Washington. How do you prepare for this kind of debate, in this particularly extraordinary moment in American politics? There are a lot of candidates, no doubt about it. And so many critical issues to ask about. This debate could go on until the sun comes up. But we\u2019ve had to cull the many things we could ask into one meaty debate in one evening. How important is it to ask about what\u2019s happening with the administration versus what\u2019s happening in Democratic policy circles? Put another way, what\u2019s the balancing act between asking about President Trump and, say, health care policy? I can\u2019t get into the questions. I\u2019ve been sworn to secrecy. You\u2019re a print guy about to enter a TV world. Is that nerve-racking? I\u2019ve been in the hotel gym a couple of times a day to remain calm. I can already do more pull-ups than James Comey has set as his goal. How much do you take into account what happened at past debates when making your plan of attack for this one? I\u2019ve watched every previous debate and every candidates\u2019 forum from this election season. That\u2019s hours and hours of preparation. I know you can\u2019t tell us the questions. But, seriously, can you tell us the questions? Any hints, at least? There will be questions, many questions, and they will be substantive questions. Does that answer your question? Any pre-debate rituals? This is my very first debate, so I have no ritual. I\u2019m open to suggestions. And I\u2019m not certain yet how I will nourish myself immediately beforehand. There\u2019s this great taco joint a couple of blocks from my hotel, though. Uh, don\u2019t think we\u2019re talking about quite the same Saints. Were you forwarded this newsletter?

But many of them, too, want to withdraw from the Middle East.By David E. SangerPRINT EDITIONTrump\u2019s Foreign Policy Draws Wide Criticism And Differing Ideas|October 16, 2019, Page A16",
      "author": "David E. Sanger",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 For nearly two decades, Republicans have dominated national security debates, portraying themselves as tough on terrorists after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and tough on a recalcitrant, disruptive Russia. On Tuesday night, Democrats sensed an opportunity to retake that ground, attacking President Trump\u2019s impulsive action in Syria as a gift to the Islamic State and to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. But it was not an easy path. Debating American foreign policy among themselves in a sustained way for the first time in the campaign, the 12 candidates on the debate stage in Ohio found themselves caught between their party\u2019s intensifying instinct to extract the United States from war and their desire to cast Mr. Trump\u2019s rapid retreat from Syria as dangerous and incompetent. In heated exchanges, the candidates were largely unified in their critique of Mr. Trump\u2019s willingness to abandon the Kurds in northern Syria; \u201cbetrayal\u201d was the most commonly used word. They drew a clear distinction between the president\u2019s impulsiveness and their own promises to maintain alliances and bring American forces home in a deliberate, orderly way. At moments, they sounded like Mr. Trump\u2019s many Republican critics in Congress, who have been equally critical of his handling of the crisis in Syria. Yet the Democrats struggled to articulate what strategy they would pursue if they inherited the carnage and disarray stemming from Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to give Turkey\u2019s leader, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, what amounted to a green light to invade his neighbor. Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to pull American troops without a backup plan put the dozen Democrats in an unusual position: It ceded to them strong-on-counterterrorism ground once largely dominated by Republicans. One by one the Democrats warned that Mr. Trump was allowing thousands of Islamic State terrorists, now breaking free from camps where they were contained by Kurdish forces in Syria, to again pose an imminent threat to the region, and ultimately to the United States. They were clearly suggesting that if a terrorist strike emanated from the region, they would blame Mr. Trump\u2019s failure to anticipate the consequences of his actions. \u201cHe has helped ISIS get another foothold, a new lease on life,\u201d Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said during what amounted to the first extensive discussion of national security in the Democratic debates so far. \u201cWe have ISIS that is going to come here,\" said her chief rival in the polls, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. But both candidates exhibited the complex straddle that Democrats are performing these days, as they try to sound tougher and more competent than Mr. Trump while also playing to their party\u2019s aversion to keeping American troops indefinitely in war zones. \u201cI think that we ought to get out of the Middle East,\u201d Ms. Warren said. She then dwelled on a description of how she would pull back differently, and more skillfully, than Mr. Trump\u2019s rapid and chaotic retreat in the past week. Mr. Biden, the only one of the candidates with a long record in foreign issues, declined \u2014 twice \u2014 to answer a question about whether he would reinsert the American troops that have been withdrawn from northern Syria. Instead, he talked about protecting the forces still in the country, saying he would give them air cover and \u201cmake it clear they\u2019re not going anywhere.\u201d He then turned to Mr. Trump\u2019s abandonment of the Kurds, America\u2019s longtime ally in fighting ISIS, shouting: \u201cThis is shameful! Shameful what this man has done.\u201d Only Mayor Pete Buttigieg of Indiana, who served in Afghanistan, made the distinction between ending large combat operations and keeping \u201ca small number of specialized, special operations forces and intelligence capabilities\u201d on the ground, especially in Syria. Those forces, he argued, \u201cwere the only thing that stood between that part of Syria\u201d and \u201cthe beginning of a genocide and the resurgence of ISIS.\u201d It is a distinction Mr. Trump, and many of those seeking to run against him on the Democratic ticket, have passed by. The exchanges on Syria, followed by a parallel discussion of how to contain Russia\u2019s increasing aggressiveness, underscored one of the oddities of the 2020 election season: Faced with a Republican president who has envisioned a far more isolationist approach to American power, the Democrats are sounding like interventionist Republicans of just a few years ago. When Mitt Romney ran against President Barack Obama in 2012, he called Russia the \u201cNo. 1 geopolitical foe\u201d facing the United States and argued that containing Mr. Putin would be his top priority. That led Mr. Obama, with a laugh, to respond: \u201cThe 1980s, they\u2019re now calling to ask for their foreign policy back,\u201d an effort to paint Mr. Romney as a cold warrior who did not realize that era had passed. Now, that Russia-focused policy is back for those hoping to reassemble Mr. Obama\u2019s coalition. In sharp contrast to Mr. Trump, who has never been openly critical of Mr. Putin, several said they would expose the Russian leader\u2019s links to corruption and freeze his bank accounts. (That was a measure briefly considered \u2014 and rejected \u2014 by Mr. Obama in late 2016, as he tried to figure out how to punish Mr. Putin as the interference in the presidential election that year became clear.) The candidates tried to outdo one another in explaining how tough they would be on Moscow. \u201cWe have not talked about what we need to do to protect ourselves from Russia invading our election,\u201d said Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. She called for the entire nation to use backup paper ballots, a step that Tom Steyer, the billionaire hedge-fund manager who gained a name \u2014 and a place on the debate stage on Tuesday night \u2014 with an expensive campaign to press for Mr. Trump\u2019s impeachment, said he \u201cabsolutely\u201d would freeze Mr. Putin\u2019s assets. But it was Syria that gave Mr. Steyer, and most of the other candidates, the opportunity they sought to present Mr. Trump as an erratic, unthinking commander in chief, incapable at looking around corners or considering the second-order effects of his actions. \u201cMr. Trump\u2019s having no plans, having no process and having no partners has proved to be a disaster in Syria,\u201d he argued. He called the president\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d approach, a slogan he adopted during the 2016 campaign, \u201c the worst idea I have ever heard and I would change it on day one.\u201d But at the same time, the candidates repeatedly struggled to explain how they would handle a problem like Mr. Erdogan, an ostensible ally who has in the past few months bought Russian air defenses and sent troops to seize territory in a neighboring state. \u201cTurkey is not a U.S. ally,\" said Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, \u201cwhen they invade another country and engage in mass slaughter.\u201d But he quickly turned the issue back to Mr. Trump, blaming him, not Mr. Erdogan, for the current crisis. \u201cYou tell me what country in the world will trust the word of the president of the United States,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. Mr. Biden came the closest to describing how he would approach the situation today, suggesting he would threaten to expel Turkey from North Atlantic Treaty Organization \u2014 a step that would be difficult to impossible under the alliance\u2019s charter \u2014 and lay out a series of steps that would force Mr. Erdogan to reverse course. But his prescription of tough talk to force a dubious ally into line sounded much like what Mr. Trump is belatedly seeking to do by sending Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the new national security adviser, Robert C. O\u2019Brien, to Turkey this week.",

      "author": "Neil Vigdor",
      "content": " It was an unusual juxtaposition for Democrats \u2014 calling a Republican president weak militarily. That\u2019s how the contenders for the party\u2019s nomination framed the recent withdrawal of American troops from northern Syria under President Trump, who they said during Tuesday night\u2019s debate had created turmoil with his impulsive foreign policy decision making. \u201cIt\u2019s been the most shameful thing any president has done in modern history in terms of foreign policy,\u201d former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said. While Democrats have been consumed with the Trump administration\u2019s dealings with Russia and Ukraine, the emerging foreign policy crisis in Syria presented a delicate test for the party\u2019s presidential hopefuls on the debate stage. It followed Mr. Trump\u2019s decision this month to withdraw American troops from northern Syria, one that has been sharply criticized by Republicans and now Democrats, who said it would endanger Kurdish allies in the region. Mr. Trump said he was trying to \u201cend the endless wars.\u201d Mr. Biden, a former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, called the move a betrayal and said it would throw Syria into chaos and embolden Islamic State militants. The issue appeared to give Mr. Biden an opening to burnish his foreign policy credentials and contrast himself with his main rivals, Senator Elizabeth Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders. \u201cThey lost their lives,\u201d Mr. Biden said of the Kurds. \u201cThis is shameful.\u201d Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., who served as an intelligence officer in the United States Navy Reserve and was deployed to Afghanistan, admonished Mr. Trump over the withdrawal. \u201cWhat we were doing in Syria was keeping our word,\u201d Mr. Buttigieg said. \u201cPart of what makes it possible for the United States to get people to put their lives on the line to back us up is the idea that we will back them up, too.\u201d \u201cWhen I was deployed, not just the Afghan national army forces but the janitors put their lives on the line just by working with U.S. forces,\u201d he continued. \u201cI would have a hard time today looking an Afghan civilian or soldier in the eye after what just happened over there.\u201d Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders both assailed Mr. Trump\u2019s abrupt withdrawal declaration, but both have long opposed American intervention in the conflict. \u201cSo, look, I think we ought to get out of the Middle East,\u201d Ms. Warren said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should have troops in the Middle East, but we have to do it the right way, the smart way.\u201d Mr. Sanders said Mr. Trump\u2019s credibility was completely undermined. \u201cNow you tell me what country in the world will trust the word of the president of the United States?\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cIn other words, what he has done is wreck our ability to do foreign policy, to do military policy, because nobody in the world will believe this pathological liar.\u201d And then there was Representative Tulsi Gabbard, whom Senator Kamala Harris had called an apologist for Syria\u2019s president, Bashar al-Assad. In 2017, Ms. Gabbard visited Mr. Assad, whose government used chemical weapons against rebels during a May 2018 attack in Syria\u2019s civil war, the United States concluded. Ms. Gabbard, who was deployed to Iraq, criticized the presence of American troops in Syria and the Trump administration\u2019s handling of their withdrawal, both of which she said contributed to the killing of Kurds by Turkish-backed forces. \u201cFirst of all, we\u2019ve got to understand the reality of the situation there, which is that the slaughter of the Kurds being done by Turkey is yet another negative consequence of the regime change war we\u2019ve been waging in Syria,\u201d Ms. Gabbard said. Despite the shared military service of Ms. Gabbard and Mr. Buttigieg, the two veterans split over whether to keep American troops in Syria. Mr. Buttigieg said that Ms. Gabbard was \u201cdead wrong,\u201d and that the slaughter was not caused by the presence of American troops but by the abrupt withdrawal of troops by the Trump administration. Ms. Gabbard responded: Mr. Buttigieg said Ms. Gabbard had aligned herself with the Trump administration on the issue. \u201cYou can put an end to endless war without embracing Donald Trump\u2019s policy, as you\u2019re doing,\u201d Mr. Buttigieg said. Ms. Gabbard said Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s stance didn\u2019t make sense. \u201cWhat is an endless war if it\u2019s not a regime change war?\u201d Ms. Gabbard said.",

      "content": "  As part of our 2020 debate coverage, we are asking political debate coaches and experts to tell us what each candidate needs to do to win, and what advice they would give those onstage. Then we will ask the experts afterward how the candidates did. KELLY The former vice president should aggressively set the record straight armed with facts and outside validators, and make clear that Trump\u2019s motivation is simple: He\u2019s scared of running against Biden and is trying to pick a different nominee. Biden should then quickly pivot back to what voters love and believe about him: that he\u2019s fighting for working families and has a record of delivering on issues like health care, while Donald Trump has failed these very same workers and families. A kitchen table contrast with Biden is deadly for Trump. O\u2019DONNELL Biden needs to answer the question of how his son got the position in Ukraine carefully, but stay on offense if he is to escape having this rub off on him more than it has. If the press drills down, and he appears weak, then others might pile on or use it to frame Biden as part of the past they\u2019re attempting to move on from. His hope has to be to keep pivoting this to impeachment. POTTER Warren has managed to win the inside track on the \u201cchange\u201d message in a primary where voters\u2019 top concern is beating Donald Trump, and this debate is a chance to tie those threads together through the lens of corruption. While a process-heavy discussion of impeachment will likely be unhelpful to her, Warren could do herself a world of good by packaging the known facts surrounding Ukraine as an easy-to-understand tale of Washington influence-peddling. FINNEY Clearly the vision Warren is campaigning on is more popular than is being given credit, but she still has to keep making the case that her ideas can win in a general election. Her strategy ought to be to continue to convince voters that she can be the commander-in-chief, steward of our economy, and that these ideas can win. DUNN Follow the old rule of show, don\u2019t tell. Senator Sanders demonstrates that he is all vim and vigor by acting that way and not talking about it. Expect him to try and act the same as he has in every previous debate. KELLY First of all, I hope that Senator Sanders is healthy and fully recovers soon. But this is a real issue. Certainly, he\u2019ll need to show energy throughout the three-hour debate and make a strong case for himself, remaining engaged throughout. But ultimately, he is 78 years old and had a heart attack. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a tactical silver bullet for the debate stage that can change those facts or demonstrate that he\u2019s healthy enough to be president of the United States. O\u2019DONNELL The November debate will be too late to have a break out moment. He has to have a moment early in this debate where he commands the stage and gets the narrative moving in his direction. The problem for him has been identity and message. He needs to find both. All the money in the world can\u2019t buy that. He also needs to have a moment where he shows competitive advantage over one of the front-runners \u2014 Warren or Biden \u2014 by taking them on over an issue where he has a real different message. He should not waste time arguing with Beto O\u2019Rourke over guns. So if he doesn\u2019t differentiate himself, he\u2019ll be on the stage for the rest of the debates, but will be out of the media conversation and out of contention. POTTER Her success depends on getting multiple opportunities to deliver sharp, simple-to-understand critiques of President Trump. Harris\u2019s greatest success on the debate stage came from creating the impression she would badly outclass Trump in a general election debate, but she has generally been unable to build on that. Her campaign\u2019s goal should be to remind voters of her unique skills in this area, perhaps on an under-addressed issue such as reproductive rights. O\u2019DONNELL His only lane is a pragmatist, more moderate approach to policy. He can never beat Warren and Sanders on their agenda, so trying to position himself more in line with Biden has to be his approach. What does that mean for the debate? He has to take on Sanders or Warren and prove that his approach is better and take on Biden and prove he would be a better president than Biden. DUNN Senator Klobuchar has already been performing very, very well \u2014 but it is not moving the needle. That\u2019s a hard position to be in. Her best bet is to draw contrast with Senator Warren and try to use Warren\u2019s momentum to build her own. KALL He should try to take credit for the impeachment inquiry since he spent so much time and money on this process. He was at the forefront of this initiative before most, but he can\u2019t let this issue singularly define his candidacy and debate talking points. FINNEY He tried to have these breakout moments at each of the debates. He ought to try to have a breakout moment that is not about attacking someone else but is about making the case that he is the right person for this moment. We still haven\u2019t seen that from him. KALL He needs to show the audience that he can do more than deliver quippy sound bites and engage in campaign giveaway gimmicks. He\u2019s been successful in directly attacking President Trump, but the debate is a good opportunity for him to soberly lay out his agenda and political philosophies more clearly. POTTER I would not be surprised to see O\u2019Rourke try to generate a sense of \u201cus-against-the-world\u201d among his supporters and decrying traditional political expectations that point toward an early exit. Beto O\u2019Rourke is best when he\u2019s in the role of the rebel with a cause and needs to leave Ohio with voters believing his voice is urgent and necessary once more. FINNEY She needs to act like a Democrat! I say this as someone who at onetime was a fan of hers years ago when she first was elected to Congress. I don\u2019t even recognize this person. Instead of whining and complaining, tell us what you are for. Don\u2019t just attack others.",

      "author": "Shane Goldmacher",
      "content": "  WESTERVILLE, Ohio \u2014 The CNN/New York Times debate on Tuesday night revealed new dynamics in the Democratic presidential race: Senator Elizabeth Warren took sustained fire from multiple rivals, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. struggled to make an impact and Mayor Pete Buttigieg and other candidates were newly aggressive in making their points. Here are six takeaways from the debate: For the first time this year, Ms. Warren was frequently called out and criticized by her rivals: For a candidate who has risen in the polls based on her policy acumen and specifics, Ms. Warren\u2019s unwillingness to address the question of whether her \u201cMedicare for all\u201d plan would require higher taxes on the middle class was striking. And her opponents put her on the defensive. Ms. Warren in large part survived the attacks, though she never did answer questions about whether she\u2019d raise those middle-class taxes. Nor did she explain to Ms. Harris why she thought Mr. Trump should remain on Twitter. But she did present a concise counterargument, saying that only her ambitious ideas could produce an electoral mandate from disaffected Americans to defeat Mr. Trump. In all, the debate served as a certification of Ms. Warren\u2019s status as one of two front-runners in the race, alongside Mr. Biden. It also crystallized much of the 19-way race as a contest to be the Biden alternative. The candidates sparring with Ms. Warren were auditioning to Democratic voters not just how they would go toe-to-toe with President Trump, but also how they would stack up against Ms. Warren as the campaign narrows to just a few candidates. Unlike in the previous three debates, nobody instigated a fight with Mr. Biden. It was both a sign of his diminished status in the race \u2014 he\u2019s no longer the solo front-runner, having ceded ground to Ms. Warren \u2014 as well as evidence that attacking Mr. Biden hasn\u2019t served his rivals well when they\u2019ve tried. The toughest moment for Mr. Biden came when the moderators pressed him on his son Hunter Biden\u2019s work in Ukraine. When no candidate pressed him on the topic, it faded from the discussion after Mr. Biden delivered a garbled and wobbly explanation. Mr. Biden, as is his custom, at times wandered away from the question at hand. During a monologue about tax rates, he bemoaned the size of the field and the relatively brief amount of time allotted candidates to answer questions. He was strongest when on offense against Ms. Warren. But it was a telling sign that his rivals tried to present themselves as a Biden alternative by contrasting themselves with Ms. Warren instead of Mr. Biden. She, not the former vice president, looked like the candidate to beat on Tuesday night. He railed against billionaires. He pitched \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d He tossed out his campaign URL. He said \u201cdamn\u201d \u2014 twice. It was vintage Bernie Sanders on Tuesday \u2014 and that was a relief to his supporters and advisers two weeks after Mr. Sanders, 78, suffered a heart attack. \u201cI\u2019m healthy, I\u2019m feeling great,\u201d Mr. Sanders said as the debate approached the two-hour mark. But by then he had made that case with his performance, dueling with Mr. Biden over their ideological differences and thrusting his arm into the air to seek more airtime. \u201cWe are going to be mounting a vigorous campaign all over this country. That is how I think I can reassure the American people,\u201d Mr. Sanders said when asked about his health. When Senator Cory Booker interjected with a joke that Mr. Sanders also supports medical marijuana, Mr. Sanders did not hesitate with the retort, \u201cI\u2019m not on it tonight.\u201d He may not have won over new supporters, but he looked like the same old Bernie Sanders. For this debate, that was more than enough. For months, Mr. Buttigieg has been satisfied to make most of his points at the debates without scoring them at the expense of his rivals. That ended Tuesday. Mr. Buttigieg sparred sharply with former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke on guns. He rebuked Representative Tulsi Gabbard on foreign policy. And, most notably, he engaged in the most substantive and sustained contrast of any candidate yet with Ms. Warren. It was Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s exchange with Ms. Warren over \u201cMedicare for all\u201d that was most memorable, pressing her as she declined to say, yet again, whether her plan would require a middle-class tax increase. (She says her plan would curb middle-class \u201ccosts.\u201d) \u201cA yes-or-no question that did not get a yes-or-no answer,\u201d Mr. Buttigieg said, adding, \u201cYour signature, senator, is to have a plan for everything. Except this.\u201d He rattled off how her plan would \u201cobliterate\u201d the private health insurance of 150 million Americans while pitching his \u201cMedicare for all who want it\u201d alternative. Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s rebuke of Mr. O\u2019Rourke \u2014 \u201cI don\u2019t need lessons from you on courage\u201d \u2014 may lend itself more to a viral moment. But the bigger leap was to be seen as a foil to Ms. Warren. It felt at times on Tuesday as if the sprawling 12-person stage had actually narrowed to a four-person debate, with Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders representing the left, and Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg representing the center-left. The occasional television shot of just those four served to hammer home the point. Mr. Booker and Ms. Harris were not the main course on Tuesday. They were the palate cleansers. They came into the debate struggling for support and attention. And it was apparent by the end of the first hour that they had adopted a similar game plan: seeking to rise above the fray and food fight unfolding around them while punching at President Trump. \u201cTearing each other down because we have a different plan is unacceptable,\u201d Mr. Booker said. He had been the first candidate to castigate the media for asking Mr. Biden questions about his son\u2019s work in Ukraine. At one point, Ms. Harris aired a complaint that women\u2019s advocates have pressed for months: the lack of questions about abortion. \u201cThis is the sixth debate we have had in this presidential cycle. Not one word with all of these discussions about health care, on women\u2019s access to health care. It\u2019s outrageous,\u201d Ms. Harris said. On Tuesday, both Ms. Harris and Mr. Booker hit Mr. Trump harder on foreign affairs than any rivals onstage. This is not a new strategy. Ms. Harris focused on Mr. Trump during the last debate, too. And for two candidates who have punched their ticket to November, this was a bloodless way to sell themselves without much risk on a crowded stage. The sixth night of Democratic presidential debates delivered three hours of discussion but no signature moments and little likely to be remembered when the primaries and caucuses begin in February. The most contentious exchanges \u2014 between Ms. Warren and Mr. Buttigieg, and then again between Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren \u2014 were intermittent, spaced throughout a debate that by obligation had to include seven candidates who haven\u2019t sniffed 5 percent in a poll in months. With so many low-polling candidates obligated to get speaking time, too, the debate meandered through exchanges with Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. O\u2019Rourke and the former housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, each of whom faces long odds to appear at the party\u2019s next debate on Nov. 20 in Atlanta. The billionaire investor Tom Steyer was there, too, though in his first debate appearance, he spent more time introducing himself to Democratic voters than he did making a case for why he\u2019d be better than anyone else onstage. While exposing the divisions between the party\u2019s factions, the most taut moments of contrast served more as an example of what is to come once the field shrinks.",

      "content": "   The Democratic field has lined up squarely behind Joseph R. Biden Jr. over President Trump\u2019s baseless allegations that, as vice president, Mr. Biden acted improperly to benefit his son\u2019s overseas business interests. But for many of Mr. Biden\u2019s rivals, the tougher question has been whether they think his son, Hunter Biden, should have been working for foreign interests while his father was vice president. On Sunday, the lawyer for the younger Mr. Biden said he was stepping down from the board of a Chinese company and would refrain from working for \u201cforeign-owned companies\u201d if his father was elected president. And in an interview with ABC News released this morning, Hunter Biden shared more of his side of the story, saying that while he showed \u201cpoor judgment\u201d in accepting the board position, Mr. Trump\u2019s accusations of wrongdoing were \u201cridiculous.\u201d How Mr. Biden handles questions about his son will be closely watched, as will how the rest of the field balances addressing Hunter Biden\u2019s work with denouncing Mr. Trump. Since his heart attack two weeks ago in Las Vegas and the insertion of two stents to clear a blocked artery, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has been off the campaign trail recovering, mostly at his home in Burlington, Vt. While Mr. Sanders, 78, has sat for interviews, spoken to press on the street outside his home and recorded videos, the debate will be his biggest event since his heart attack. While most of the candidates have political objectives on Tuesday, Mr. Sanders has a different kind of hurdle to clear, as his former adviser Mark Longabaugh told our colleague Sydney Ember. \u201cI think he has only one objective in this debate, and that\u2019s just to show that he\u2019s healthy,\u201d Mr. Longabaugh said. Mr. Sanders said last week the medical episode would \u201cchange the nature\u201d of his campaign, which has been among the most punishing in the field. \u201cWe were doing, you know, in some cases five or six meetings a day, three or four rallies and town meetings and meeting with groups of people,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to do that.\u201d But Mr. Sanders quickly said that he had been misinterpreted and that his candidacy will continue full steam ahead. The first and biggest test will be how he performs at the debate. For weeks now, as she\u2019s cemented herself as a fellow front-runner alongside Mr. Biden, the word has been that Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts would see more sustained scrutiny from her fellow candidates. It hasn\u2019t quite happened yet. But this may be beginning to change. Without naming Ms. Warren, Mr. Biden last week, called her health care plan \u201cdishonest.\u201d Mr. Sanders contrasted himself with Ms. Warren by saying she is \u201ca capitalist through her bones,\u201d while he is not. So far, Ms. Warren has been extremely lucky as a presidential candidate. At each moment when the heat on her has turned up, something happened to dial it down. Last month when Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and others, including the late-night host Stephen Colbert, criticized her for refusing to say whether the middle class would pay for her health care proposal, attention quickly shifted to Mr. Trump\u2019s conduct on a call with the Ukrainian president. When Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign made the embarrassing revelation that it fired a senior staffer who faced sexual harassment allegations, the Sanders campaign moments later announced that the Vermont senator had suffered a heart attack. Polls of early-state voters show that Ms. Warren is the most popular Democratic presidential candidate, but that\u2019s in part because no other candidate has taken a shot at her. If none do on Tuesday, it will be another month before their next best chance to do so. After three debates that each began with in-the-weeds discussions about health care policy, Tuesday\u2019s face-off in Ohio comes in the midst of an impeachment inquiry of Mr. Trump and after a weekend of cataclysmic fallout after Mr. Trump abruptly changed United States policy in Syria. The debate is the first opportunity for the 12 candidates onstage \u2014 who have each endorsed impeaching Mr. Trump \u2014 to demonstrate contrasting visions of how they would address the president. While each of the Democratic candidates have condemned Mr. Trump\u2019s action and conduct in the White House, they all realize there is danger in placing opposition to him at the center of their campaigns. Democratic primary voters loathe the president, but on the campaign trail few ask the candidates to respond to the latest outrage of the day \u2014 let alone the foreign policy legacy of the Iraq war. Voters, the candidates know by now, want to know the specifics about how their platforms will make their lives better, what policies they will seek to implement as president and, perhaps most of all, how they can win a general election. While the candidates are onstage, their bookkeepers will be busy with an entirely different event: formally disclosing how much their campaigns raised and spent in July, August and September. Almost all the candidates \u2014 besides Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former housing secretary, and Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii \u2014 have announced how much they have raised, with Mr. Sanders pacing the field with $25.3 million. But the top lines are hardly the only interesting element of the disclosures. While Mr. Sanders, Ms. Warren and Senator Kamala Harris of California have all disclosed how much cash they will have on hand heading into the final quarter of 2019, Mr. Biden notably did not. The general rule of thumb for such things is that campaigns release good news early and hold bad news for as long as possible. (Former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas did not disclose his dismal $3.6 million second-quarter haul until hours before the previous deadline, for instance.) That bodes ill for Mr. Castro\u2019s financial state of affairs and Mr. Biden\u2019s cash-on-hand.",

      "author": "Alexander Burns",
      "content": "  COLUMBUS, Ohio \u2014 For months, the Democratic presidential race has seemed to move inexorably toward a confrontation between former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. As Ms. Warren gathered financial support and strength in the polls, Mr. Biden steadily slid on both fronts while the rest of the Democratic field stagnated with voters. A jumbled primary appeared on the verge of becoming a contest between two front-runners. But the debate in central Ohio on Tuesday night showed that the rest of the Democratic pack was not ready to yield. From the moderate wing of the party, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota are now confronting Ms. Warren directly on her policy views and challenging Mr. Biden implicitly for his status as the party\u2019s dominant centrist. From the left, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has returned to the race with force after a heart attack that shook his candidacy, collecting valuable endorsements from prominent left-wing women in Congress, including Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Klobuchar, in assailing Ms. Warren by name, and Mr. Sanders, in rolling out endorsements from the most coveted figures in progressive politics, are acknowledging the same urgency about halting the drift toward a two-person primary. But that task could be easier because of what may ultimately prove to be this week\u2019s most consequential development: Mr. Biden, who raised $6.3 million on the day he entered the race in April, revealed Tuesday that he has run through so much money that he has less than $9 million left. That is far less than what the two leading liberals in the race, Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren, as well as Mr. Buttigieg, have on hand. Mr. Biden insisted on Wednesday that he was \u201cconfident\u201d in his financial position and was not contemplating any changes to his campaign because of money. But between Mr. Biden\u2019s apparent weakness, the sudden onslaught against Ms. Warren and signs of new relevance from Mr. Sanders, there is now at least enough uncertainty in the race to encourage even long-shot candidates to persist. \u201cPeople have been saying the race was going to solidify into Biden-versus-Warren,\u201d said Paul Begala, a longtime Democratic strategist. \u201cI think instead it has become more fluid than ever.\u201d Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, who is backing Ms. Klobuchar, said in an interview Wednesday he believed there was still plenty of room to make headway in the Democratic race, because many voters were only now \u201creally listening and tuning in.\u201d \u201cIt felt like the moment is here,\u201d Mr. Walz said of the debate. Without criticizing other candidates by name, Mr. Walz predicted Ms. Klobuchar would appeal to \u201ca broader swath of folks\u201d beyond activists on the left, and also to voters\u2019 \u201chunger to get back to a decency and a normalcy\u201d \u2014 political currents Mr. Biden has sought to tap into, with mixed success. Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren, of course, continue to loom over their rivals and it is unlikely that the debate will prompt an immediate change in fortunes for either candidate. On Wednesday, Mr. Biden attempted to reassert himself by taking on Ms. Warren in more caustic terms at an event in Ohio. He called it \u201cabsolutely ridiculous\u201d that Ms. Warren had not been clearer about how she would pay for a \u201cMedicare for all\u201d system and challenged her to be \u201ccandid and honest\u201d about it. At the moment, Ms. Warren appears to have an upper hand in most of the early-voting states, along with a powerful campaign war chest stocked with a reservoir of online donors, while Mr. Biden still holds a slight lead in national polls and the conviction among many older Democrats that he would be the safest nominee to challenge President Trump. Yet both Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren have vulnerabilities that their underdog opponents are now determined to exploit: his poll numbers have dropped steadily since the start of the summer and his campaign is in the midst of a financial crunch. And Ms. Warren must still allay Democratic concerns about her strength as a general-election candidate and strike a delicate balance between locking down liberal voters who also like Mr. Sanders while growing her support among moderates and racial minorities. Aaron Pickrell, an Ohio-based Democratic strategist, said the debate had shown that \u201cother candidates getting into the top tier is not insurmountable.\u201d Both Ms. Klobuchar and Mr. Buttigieg, he said, had begun to break through with a message of Midwestern pragmatism that could appeal to voters in the early states. \u201cThey\u2019re setting themselves up as a potential alternative for Biden,\u201d Mr. Pickrell said. \u201cYou can see these folks breaking through when we get to Iowa.\u201d Surveys there indicate that about half the Democrats planning to participate in the caucuses are moderate or conservative; many of these voters have said they are uncommitted or are supporting Mr. Biden but willing to change their minds. Some candidates have more maneuvering room than others to challenge the two leaders: Whereas Mr. Buttigieg and Mr. Sanders are flush with cash, Ms. Klobuchar is in a far more tenuous financial position and has yet to qualify for the debate in November. At least a few other candidates who took an assertive approach Tuesday are in similar straits, straining to raise money or meet the debate threshold or both. What could prove decisive in Iowa, and beyond, is if centrist voters coalesce behind a single candidate or fracture among the group of hopefuls presenting themselves as pragmatists. If Mr. Biden cannot recover a measure of momentum, but holds on to enough support to block other candidates from building a coalition of more moderate Democrats, it could allow Ms. Warren or Mr. Sanders to roll through the earliest primaries and caucuses with relatively weak opposition. This scenario, of a sort of zombie Biden candidacy, is what most alarms supporters of other center-left Democrats in the race. Mayor Nan Whaley of Dayton, Ohio, a close ally of Mr. Buttigieg, predicted the South Bend mayor would now \u201cdig down deep in Iowa and New Hampshire,\u201d carrying his message from the debate \u2014 a combination of uplifting rhetoric about the future and blunt criticism of certain progressive policies \u2014 into the early states where he\u2019s polling in fourth place. Ms. Whaley said she expected Mr. Buttigieg, 37, to make a determined effort to displace Mr. Biden as the candidate seen as most capable of speaking to Midwesterners. \u201cWhat you have with Pete is, you have somebody who speaks so amazingly well to this part of the country and is incredibly electable,\u201d Ms. Whaley said, adding, \u201cWhat Biden does is, he tells you all he\u2019s done for us, which really hasn\u2019t been enough because we\u2019ve had 30 years of failed policy in the Midwest.\u201d But it is not Mr. Buttigieg who is depending on millennials to claim the nomination \u2014 it\u2019s the oldest candidate in the race, the 78-year-old Mr. Sanders. And that is why his endorsements from Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota \u2014 and an expected one from Rashida Tlaib of Michigan \u2014 could prove so vital to at least sustaining his campaign. Their appeal with younger progressives offers Mr. Sanders a vote of confidence he can trumpet to the voting bloc that makes up his strongest constituency. That cue has particular resonance in this moment, when even some of the senator\u2019s supporters have been wondering about his prospects following his hospitalization and acknowledgment that he may have to slow down the pace of his campaign. \u201cTheir endorsement is huge in validating him as a face for the party and movement going forward,\u201d said Representative Ro Khanna of California, a co-chair of Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign. Mr. Khanna said the backing from three women of color would help Mr. Sanders in another crucial way at a time when Democrats are moving left on racial issues \u2014 by rebutting the criticism that his is a niche campaign for white, left-wing men. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say we\u2019re just Bernie Bros when you have the most visible progressives from communities of color coming out and saying, \u2018We\u2019re for Bernie Sanders,\u2019\u201d Mr. Khanna argued. \u201cThat\u2019s more powerful than what Bernie Sanders or any of his co-chairs can say about his polling or support.\u201d The question now, for Mr. Sanders and the other well-funded contenders, is how they begin spending their money. With the race moving into the fall and the candidates needing ways to get attention amid saturation of coverage with the impeachment inquiry, many Democrats expect the attacks on the debate stage to begin playing out on the airwaves. Even more than the verbal fisticuffs and flashy endorsements, it was Mr. Biden\u2019s comparably weak financial standing that prompted many Democrats to think a new phase may be at hand. \u201cThat went off like a bomb this morning,\u201d said Mr. Begala, noting that his phone was \u201cblowing up with texts\u201d about the putative front-runner\u2019s money struggles. Mr. Biden\u2019s problem could be even more dire than it appears, Mr. Begala said. That\u2019s because he is so reliant on raising money from wealthy donors, who are often fickle and want to pick a winner, while those who outraised him can keep bringing in contributions online without devoting so much time and money to finance events.",

      "content": " Sign up here to get On Politics in your inbox. Elizabeth Warren got a taste of that front-runner life in Tuesday night\u2019s CNN/New York Times debate. Yes, I know, she\u2019s not leading in all the polls. Joe Biden is clearly still a force to be reckoned with in the Democratic presidential race. But there\u2019s little question that Ms. Warren\u2019s surge in the contest has reached a point where she has become the major obstacle to anyone seeking the nomination. That shift hardly went unnoticed by the rest of the field. By my count, seven different candidates attacked Ms. Warren, on everything from her economic plans to her support for voluntary gun buybacks. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota accused Ms. Warren of reciting \u201cRepublican talking points.\u201d Former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas said Ms. Warren was focused on \u201cbeing punitive\u201d in her plan to tax the wealth of the richest Americans. Senator Kamala Harris of California tried to hit Ms. Warren over her refusal to call for President Trump\u2019s Twitter account to be suspended \u2014 an attack Ms. Warren barely even acknowledged. Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., who took some of the most aggressive shots at Ms. Warren, probed how she would pay for her health care plan and whether it would involve raising taxes on middle-class families \u2014 a question she continued to dodge last night. \u201cYour signature, senator, is to have a plan for everything, except this,\u201d said Mr. Buttigieg, after calling her \u201cevasive.\u201d Even Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii tried to get in a jab or two, demanding to be shown Ms. Warren\u2019s qualifications to be commander in chief. Ms. Warren ignored the request. One of the most striking moments came when Mr. Biden tried to take some credit for the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, one of Ms. Warren\u2019s signature achievements. \u201cI went on the floor and got you votes\u201d in Congress, he said, forcefully repeating himself three times. Ms. Warren responded, \u201cI am deeply grateful to President Obama, who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law,\u201d making no mention of Mr. Biden or his work. \u201cYou did a hell of a job in your job,\u201d he shot back. Ms. Warren, seeming slightly taken aback by Mr. Biden\u2019s biting tone (or perhaps looking to troll him), offered a quiet \u201cthank you.\u201d The exchange marked a notable reversal in the race: In past debates, it was Mr. Biden who found himself fending off a series of attacks from opponents trying to weaken his commanding position in the race. With his numbers sliding and the latest financial reports showing that he trails several rivals in campaign cash, Ms. Warren now faces her turn in the spotlight. On Tuesday night, she held her own through the incoming fire, trying to turn the attacks back on her critics by casting them as lacking in political vision and ambition. And by refusing to answer whether her health care plan would raise taxes on the middle class, she avoided creating a sound bite that her aides worry could be easily used against her in the primary \u2014 or the general election.

      "content": " [Watch the debate and follow our live analysis here.] In the pivotal industrial state of Ohio, which has been devastated by the announced closure of a General Motors plant, the Democratic contenders railed against automation and the trade policies of the Trump administration during Tuesday night\u2019s debate. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said the greed of multinational corporations has chipped away at the middle class, which she vowed to strengthen with her plan to extend the solvency of Social Security and a $200 monthly benefits increase that she claimed would elevate five million families above the poverty line. The populist pitch of Senator Warren, who has made up ground on former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., came in a state that President Trump carried in 2016 and that is critical to his re-election prospects. \u201cThe data show that we have had a lot of problems with losing jobs,\u201d Senator Warren said. She continued: Andrew Yang, the former tech executive and entrepreneur, used the issue of automation to promote his universal basic income payment plan, which he has called a freedom dividend. \u201cSenator Warren, I have been talking to Americans around the country about automation,\u201d Mr. Yang said. He continued: The former housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro said the Trump administration has not delivered on its populist message in states like Ohio, where a stalemate between G.M. and the United Auto Workers culminated with the closure of the automaker\u2019s Lordstown plant and the loss of 14,000 jobs. G.M. has said that Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs on steel, aluminum and other goods have cost the company $1 billion in profits. \u201cI believe that we need to address a community being impacted by automation,\u201d Mr. Castro said. \u201cWe need to spark job opportunity. As I mentioned earlier, here in Ohio, in the latest jobs data, Ohio is losing jobs under Donald Trump.\u201d",

      "author": "Alexander Burns",
      "content": "  WESTERVILLE, Ohio \u2014 Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts faced a sustained barrage of criticism from her Democratic rivals at a presidential debate in Ohio on Tuesday, tangling with a group of underdog moderates who assailed her liberal economic proposals, while former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. appeared to fade from the fray after parrying President Trump\u2019s attacks on his family. The debate confirmed that the primary race had entered a new phase, defined by Ms. Warren\u2019s apparent strength and the increasing willingness of other Democrats to challenge her. She has risen toward the top of the polls while confronting limited resistance from her opponents, and in past debates she attracted a fraction of the hostility that Democrats trained on Mr. Biden. That changed in a dramatic fashion on Tuesday, when a group of her rivals voiced sharp skepticism of Ms. Warren\u2019s agenda or accused her of taking impractical stances on issues like health care and taxation. Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., insistently charged Ms. Warren with evading a \u201cyes-or-no\u201d question on how she would pay for a \u201cMedicare for all\u201d health care system, while Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota cast parts of Ms. Warren\u2019s platform as a \u201cpipe dream.\u201d Former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas branded Ms. Warren\u2019s worldview as overly \u201cpunitive.\u201d Ms. Warren sought at every turn to dispense with her critics by casting them as lacking ambition or political grit. When she addressed criticism of her proposal to tax vast private fortunes, for instance, Ms. Warren suggested her opponents believed it was \u201cmore important to protect billionaires than it is to invest in an entire generation\u201d but did not single out her rivals. The debate unfolded in a drastically altered political landscape, with Mr. Trump facing impeachment and Mr. Biden in the center of a firestorm over his son\u2019s  overseas financial dealings. The candidates were prompted to cover a wide range of issues, including a number that had featured little or not at all in past debates \u2014 not just the impeachment of Mr. Trump, but the Turkish invasion of Syria, and the details of gun control policy and the taxation of great wealth. The moderators began with a series of questions about impeachment to each of the 12 candidates \u2014 the largest field ever for a primary debate \u2014 affording them an opportunity to denounce Mr. Trump. And Mr. Biden was quickly asked about his son Hunter Biden\u2019s overseas financial work, delivering a narrow, repetitive answer in which he said neither he nor his son had done anything wrong. Foreign policy played a greater role on Tuesday evening than in any other debate, pushed to the political foreground by the renewed outbreak of war and humanitarian catastrophe in Syria. The Democrats chiefly trained their attention on Mr. Trump\u2019s role in instigating the crisis there: For instance, Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former housing secretary, condemned Mr. Trump for \u201ccaging kids on the border and letting ISIS prisoners run free\u201d in Syria. With Mr. Biden a diminished force, Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Klobuchar appeared determined to present themselves as strong alternatives for voters in the middle. Both emphasized their Midwestern credentials, and Mr. Buttigieg invoked his experience as a military veteran in several wide-ranging answers on foreign policy. Their new aggressiveness represented a shorter-term calculation about halting Ms. Warren\u2019s increasing strength in Iowa. With Ms. Warren gaining there, Ms. Klobuchar and Mr. Buttigieg plainly decided to target her in an effort to appeal to the state\u2019s moderate voters, who so far have lined up with Mr. Biden. With a powerfully funded campaign and an expanding field operation in Iowa, Mr. Buttigieg may be uniquely well positioned to assert himself there. In an intense argument that reflected their changing fortunes in the race, Mr. Biden briefly went on the offensive against Ms. Warren toward the end of the debate, describing her health care plans as \u201cvague\u201d and demanding in a raised voice that she give him some credit for her signature accomplishment, the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau after the 2008 financial crisis. Ms. Warren expressed gratitude for the help she had received \u2014 not from Mr. Biden but from former President Barack Obama. But Ms. Warren was on the defensive for much of the evening and most of all on the issue of single-payer health care, when she again declined to specify precisely how she would fund a sweeping system of government-backed insurance. Unlike Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Ms. Warren has not acknowledged in plain terms that a \u201cMedicare for all\u201d plan would quite likely have to substitute broad-based taxes for private insurance premiums and other costs. \u201cI will not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle-class families,\u201d Ms. Warren said, declining to elaborate. Ms. Klobuchar, in her most assertive debate performance yet, chided Ms. Warren for not explaining to voters \u201cwhere we\u2019re going to send the invoice\u201d for single-payer care. \u201cAt least Bernie\u2019s being honest here,\u201d Ms. Klobuchar said. Ms. Warren was squeezed, at times, from the left as well: While Mr. Sanders never broke their informal nonaggression pact, he agreed with several of the moderates that it was \u201cappropriate\u201d to enumerate the financial trade-offs involved in single-payer health care, including taxes on Americans that would be \u201csubstantially less than what they were paying for premiums and out-of-pocket expenses.\u201d And while Mr. Sanders, who had a heart attack this month, was forced to address new concerns about his health, his campaign aides confirmed during the debate that he had secured an endorsement from Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York that could inject new energy into his candidacy. But there were also the germs of a broader discussion of the role of the United States in the Middle East: In an intense exchange between the two military veterans onstage, Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii said that it was not only Mr. Trump who had \u201cthe blood of the Kurds on his hands,\u201d but also politicians in both parties and news media organizations that had cheered for \u201cregime change war.\u201d Her remarks drew forceful pushback from Mr. Buttigieg, who said Ms. Gabbard was \u201cdead wrong,\u201d arguing that \u201cthe slaughter going on in Syria is not a consequence of American presence \u2014 it is a consequence of a withdrawal and a betrayal by this president of American allies and American values.\u201d While Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren did not clash directly over foreign policy, they diverged in a stark fashion over the situation in Syria. Mr. Biden said he would want to keep American troops there and convey to the Turkish government that it would pay a \u201cheavy price\u201d for its invasion. Ms. Warren said she opposed Mr. Trump\u2019s handling of the situation but believed the United States should \u201cget out of the Middle East.\u201d (Aides to Ms. Warren said she was referring to the withdrawal of troops from combat.) Throughout the debate, which was sponsored by CNN and The New York Times, Mr. Biden played a far less central role than he did in the past, stepping to the foreground for exchanges over foreign policy but otherwise taking a more passive approach. His most important moment of the night may have come early on, when he was pressed by a moderator to explain why his son had not crossed any ethical lines by doing business in Ukraine while his father was overseeing diplomacy there for the Obama administration. Mr. Biden said several times that he and his son had done \u201cnothing wrong,\u201d and alluded repeatedly to an interview Hunter Biden gave to ABC News, in which he said it had been an error in judgment to sit on the board of a Ukrainian gas company while the elder Mr. Biden was vice president. Mr. Trump has accused the Bidens of corruption, often in false or exaggerated terms, and his efforts to enlist the government of Ukraine in tarring Mr. Biden instigated an impeachment inquiry. \u201cThis is about Trump\u2019s corruption,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we should be focusing on.\u201d None of Mr. Biden\u2019s Democratic rivals chose to press the subject, reflecting both the political sensitivity of issues touching on Mr. Biden\u2019s family and also a calculation, by his most immediate rivals, that Mr. Biden is likely to continue sinking in the race without a further onslaught from fellow Democrats. While a number of candidates are hoping to peel away moderate voters from Mr. Biden, they tried to do so on Tuesday by challenging the left rather than by blasting the leading candidate of the center. Defending his political stature, Mr. Biden at one point described himself as \u201cthe only one on this stage who has gotten anything really big done,\u201d and cited his work on the Violence Against Women Act and the Obama administration\u2019s health care law. That argument drew a fierce response from Mr. Sanders, who said Mr. Biden had also achieved far less laudable feats, like the passage of the NAFTA trade deal and a law tightening the federal bankruptcy code. \u201cYou got the disastrous war in Iraq done,\u201d Mr. Sanders added. And Ms. Warren, too, took issue with Mr. Biden\u2019s claim, pointing to her role as the architect of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau \u2014 an agency, she said, that represented \u201cstructural change in our economy.\u201d In a moment of crackling tension, Mr. Biden raised his voice and urged Ms. Warren to give him credit, too, for the birth of the agency. \u201cI went onto the floor and got you votes,\u201d he said. Ms. Warren retorted by saying she was \u201cdeeply grateful for President Obama, who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law,\u201d as well as for others in the administration who did the same. Just as striking as the offensives by Ms. Klobuchar and Mr. Buttigieg were the more passive showings by Senators Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris \u2014 both of whom were counting on a strong outing. Mr. Booker repeatedly said the focus of the debate should be on Mr. Trump. He denounced the moderators\u2019 questions about Mr. Biden\u2019s son. \u201cThe only person sitting at home enjoying that was Donald Trump,\u201d Mr. Booker said. And he even defended the fitness of the septuagenarian candidates onstage \u2014 Mr. Biden, Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren \u2014 by noting that Mr. Trump would be the least healthy candidate running in 2020. Ms. Harris also mostly trained her fire on the president, at one point using her new catch line: \u201cDude gotta go.\u201d The only moment when Ms. Harris showed any appetite for tangling with the other candidates was when she demanded to know why Ms. Warren would not join her in urging Twitter to remove the president\u2019s account. Ms. Harris seemed more focused on trying to build support with women, as she spoke most forcefully about the importance of defending abortion rights. \u201cIt is her body, it is her right, it is her decision,\u201d she said. After presenting her message at the previous three debates with only intermittent challenges from her rivals, Ms. Warren was met with cutting criticism of her signature populist flourishes. \u201cI want to give a reality check to Elizabeth,\u201d said Ms. Klobuchar, before alluding to another candidate onstage, the hedge fund executive Tom Steyer. \u201cNo one on this stage wants to protect billionaires. Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires. We just have different approaches.\u201d Mr. Buttigieg was just as pointed, repeatedly casting Ms. Warren as a \u201cWashington politician,\u201d but he and Ms. Klobuchar were not alone. Even lagging candidates such as Mr. O\u2019Rourke and Andrew Yang, a former tech entrepreneur, took on Ms. Warren, all but confirming her front-runner status. And while she was eager to articulate her progressive vision here, Ms. Warren seemed just as cognizant that she must broaden her coalition beyond her core base of upscale liberal whites. She repeatedly cited her support for adding funding to historically black colleges and mentioned her brothers, who still live in her native Oklahoma and two of whom are Republicans. Mr. Sanders was not as ubiquitous a presence as he had been at past debates, but he drew applause by pre-empting a question about his health. \u201cI\u2019m healthy, I\u2019m feeling great,\u201d he said before vowing \u201ca vigorous campaign.\u201d That, Mr. Sanders said, \u201cis how I think I can reassure the American people.\u201d",

Read more here. Two weeks after he had a heart attack, Senator Bernie Sanders fielded a direct question about how he would convince voters of his strength and stamina. Mr. Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren received similar questions. Read more here. Senator Kamala Harris expressed anger at the lack of abortion-related debate questions up until that point, and Senator Cory Booker backed her up, saying women \u201cshould not be the only ones taking up this cause and this fight.\u201d Read more here. Ms. Harris criticized Ms. Warren for declining to call on Twitter to suspend Mr. Trump\u2019s account, telling her, \u201cYou can\u2019t say you\u2019re for corporate responsibility if it doesn\u2019t apply to everyone.\u201d Read more here. The candidates were mostly united in condemning President Trump\u2019s withdrawal of troops from Syria, but Representative Tulsi Gabbard stood apart. Read more here. During the same discussion of Mr. Trump\u2019s withdrawal from Syria, Ms. Gabbard denounced \u201cregime change wars\u201d and, unprompted, brought up news reports about her frequent mentions in Russian news outlets.

Mayor Pete Buttigieg and former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke picked up where they left off at a gun policy forum two weeks ago, sparring over whether an assault weapons buyback should be voluntary or mandatory. Read more here. Mr. O\u2019Rourke attacked Ms. Warren over her proposed wealth tax, saying she was being divisive instead of \u201clifting people up and making sure that this country comes together around those solutions\u201d \u2014 an attack that struck some as gendered. Ms. Warren said she was \u201creally shocked at the notion that anyone thinks I\u2019m punitive.\u201d Read more here. Mr. Buttigieg and Senator Amy Klobuchar both went after Ms. Warren on \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d accusing her of dodging the question of whether her plan would increase middle-class taxes. Ms. Warren said, as she has before, that overall costs \u2014 including premiums, deductibles and co-pays in addition to taxes \u2014 would go down for the middle class. Read more here and here.

When Senator Bernie Sanders attacked Joe Biden in April, shortly after the former vice president announced his presidential bid, Mr. Biden responded by \u2026 not responding at all. \u201cI\u2019m not going to get in a debate with my colleagues here,\u201d Mr. Biden told my colleague Jonathan Martin. That was when Mr. Biden held a commanding lead in early polling of the Democratic primary and Senator Elizabeth Warren was stuck in the single digits. My, how times have changed. On Wednesday, Mr. Biden questioned Ms. Warren\u2019s \u201ccredibility,\u201d comparing the Massachusetts senator, who has emerged as a force in the primary race, to President Trump. \u201cShe\u2019s going to have to tell the truth or the question will be raised about whether or not she\u2019s going to be candid and honest with the American people,\u201d he said. That attack came after a tense exchange during Tuesday night\u2019s debate, when Mr. Biden took some of the credit for Ms. Warren\u2019s signature achievement, the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau under Barack Obama\u2019s administration. \u201cI went on the floor and got you votes,\u201d he said, his voice rising. \u201cSo let\u2019s get those things straight, too.\u201d Ms. Warren parlayed the attack into a brutal response, thanking Mr. Obama and \u201cevery single person who fought\u201d for the agency, notably not naming Mr. Biden. Then, Mr. Biden seemed to try, again, to undermine the significance of her role. \u201cYou did a hell of a job in your job,\u201d he said, in a tone that struck some as condescending and paternalistic. A surprised Ms. Warren shrugged off the barb with a quick \u201cthank you,\u201d before pivoting back to the central message of her campaign: \u201cDream big, fight hard.\u201d Mr. Biden\u2019s more aggressive approach reflects his weakened standing in the race. In April, he was the definitive front-runner, running a type of Rose Garden, incumbent-light strategy that kept him above the fray. Now, dropping in the polls and lagging in money, he has to fight harder. But it also tells us something more about Mr. Biden\u2019s irritations with this moment in the campaign. He\u2019s frustrated: by the media, which he thinks is giving him a raw deal, and his opponents, who he believes are getting a free pass. Those resentments are manifesting in a dismissive tone and harsh attacks, at a time when aides to several other campaigns privately argue that Democrats do not want to see their candidates eviscerate one another. It\u2019s also a time when women are ascendant in the party \u2014 and at least a few Democratic voters saw sexism in Mr. Biden\u2019s tone. There are plenty of signs that Ms. Warren is beginning to face more scrutiny. She bore the brunt of the attacks on Tuesday night, facing jabs from seven of her rivals. Her refusal to say how she would pay for her \u201cMedicare for all\u201d health care plan feels untenable, risking undercutting the credentials of a candidate who has built her political brand on her policy chops. The question for Mr. Biden is whether his attacks encourage that scrutiny, or end up giving her more ammunition. We want to hear from our readers. Have a question? We\u2019ll try to answer it. Have a comment? We\u2019re all ears. Email us at onpolitics@nytimes.com. The Trump administration made a striking acknowledgment in Washington today: After President Trump had spent weeks arguing that there was no quid pro quo when he asked Ukraine to launch investigations into his political rivals, the acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, essentially confirmed that there was. He also insisted that it was standard operating procedure. In a briefing with reporters, Mr. Mulvaney acknowledged that the administration had held up military aid to Ukraine in part because of the president\u2019s request for that country to investigate a baseless theory about a missing Democratic National Committee server. \u201cI have news for everybody: Get over it,\u201d Mr. Mulvaney said. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be political influence in foreign policy.\u201d It was yet another example of Mr. Trump and his aides\u2019 admitting controversial \u2014 and possibly illegal \u2014 behavior out loud. Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s comments quickly became the new party line for the White House, echoed across the Capitol by other Trump supporters. \u201cWe have those types of expectations of our allies frequently,\u201d Representative Matt Gaetz, Republican of Florida, told reporters a few hours later. It\u2019s true, of course, that the United States bargains hard with foreign countries to further American interests \u2014 just not the president\u2019s personal interests. So why say that the Ukrainian foreign aid was conditioned on political investigations? Seems likely that it\u2019s because the evidence was increasingly moving in that direction. But it\u2019s also part of Mr. Trump\u2019s political strategy of blurting out publicly what he is accused of doing in secret. As my colleague Maggie Haberman puts it, saying the quiet part out loud removes some of the power of the secret and helps, as she puts it, \u201cmove the window of acceptability\u201d on damaging issues. My colleague Trip Gabriel sends this dispatch from Iowa: Representative Steve King of Iowa, the outspoken defender of \u201cWestern civilization\u201d and utterer of other incendiary statements, has caught a big break in his quest for a 10th term next year. Mr. King, who was stripped by fellow Republicans of his congressional committee assignments in January after he questioned why white supremacy is considered offensive, has drawn at least three Republican challengers. There\u2019s a good chance they will split the anti-King vote in next year\u2019s primary, allowing the incumbent to slide through to run again in Iowa\u2019s most conservative district. Abandoned by his party\u2019s establishment, Mr. King raised just $61,800 over the summer and has just $40,600 on hand, according to fund-raising data reported this week. He pulled in just $3,020 from conservative PACs. Two Republican challengers, Randy Feenstra, a state senator, and Bret Richards, a retired businessman, have raised more money than the incumbent. The Democratic challenger, J. D. Scholten, who came close to unseating Mr. King in 2018, raised $415,000 in the two months after announcing he would run again. But money has never mattered to Mr. King in previous races: He has universal name identification and is embraced by a sizable part of the Republican base in his district. He will also benefit from the decision by Iowa\u2019s top Republicans, Gov. Kim Reynolds and Senators Charles E. Grassley and Joni Ernst, to stay neutral ahead of the June primary. All had condemned Mr. King after his remark on white supremacy appeared in a New York Times article. (Mr. King has claimed he was misquoted.) Laura Belin, a liberal blogger in Iowa who closely monitors Mr. King, noted that he was well received in town halls this year and is cleaving to supporters by portraying himself as a victim of the media and an ardent defender of President Trump under impeachment fire. Mr. Scholten, a former professional baseball player, faces an uphill battle in a district where registered Republicans strongly outnumber Democrats. DEAR SANTA: DON\u2019T BE A FOOL!

      "author": "Karen Zraick",
      "content": " Senator Kamala Harris of California pressed Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts about why she had not called on Twitter to suspend President Trump\u2019s account during the Democratic presidential debate in Ohio on Tuesday. Ms. Warren responded that she wanted to push Mr. Trump \u201cout of the White House,\u201d not just off Twitter. But she did not weigh in on whether the president\u2019s favorite platform should suspend him. Instead, she turned the discussion back toward antitrust and campaign finance laws, repeating that she had vowed not to take money from many corporate interests. Here is a transcript of the exchange: HARRIS: Senator Warren, I just want to say that I was surprised to hear that you did not agree with me that on this subject of what should be the rules around corporate responsibility for these big tech companies, when I called on Twitter to suspend Donald Trump\u2019s account, that you did not agree. And I would urge you to join me because here we have Donald Trump, who has 65 million Twitter followers and is using that platform as the president of the United States to openly intimidate witnesses, to threaten witnesses, to obstruct justice. And he and his account should be taken down. We saw in El Paso that that shooter in his manifesto was informed by how Donald Trump uses that platform, and this is a matter of corporate responsibility. Twitter should be held accountable and shut down that site. It is a matter of safety and corporate accountability. WARREN: So, look, I don\u2019t just want to push Donald Trump off Twitter. I want to push him out of the White House. That\u2019s our job. HARRIS: Join me in saying that his Twitter account should be shut down. WARREN: No. Let\u2019s figure out \u2014 HARRIS: No? WARREN: Why it is that we have had laws on the books for antitrust for over a century, and yet for decades now, we\u2019ve all called on how the big drug companies are calling the shots in Washington, big ag, how the gun industry, big tech \u2014 you know, we really need to address the elephant in the room, and that is how campaigns are financed. HARRIS: You can\u2019t say you\u2019re for corporate responsibility if it doesn\u2019t apply to everyone. WARREN: I announced this morning that I\u2019m not going to take any money from big tech executives, from Wall Street executives. We\u2019ve already agreed, Bernie and I, we\u2019re not taking any money from big pharma executives. You can\u2019t go behind closed doors and take the money of these executives and then turn around and expect that these are the people who are actually finally going to enforce the laws. We need campaign finance rules and practices that support us all. HARRIS: It does not represent a system of justice to say that the rules will apply differently to different people. This is a matter, you are saying, of holding big tech accountable. WARREN: Yes. HARRIS: Holding big tech accountable because they have an outsized influence on people\u2019s perceptions about issues. And they actually influence behaviors. We all have to agree this is their power. It is immense. MARC LACEY, moderator: Senator Klobuchar, let me bring you in here. Your response. HARRIS: I\u2019m not finished. I\u2019m not finished. And so what I am saying is that it seems to me that you would be able to join me in saying the rule has to apply to Twitter the same way it does to Facebook. WARREN: Look, I think all of the rules should apply across the board. I don\u2019t have a problem with that. HARRIS: So you will join me in saying Twitter should shut down that account? WARREN: What I have a problem with is, if we\u2019re going to talk seriously about breaking up big tech, then we should ask if people are taking money from the big tech executives. If we\u2019re going to talk seriously about breaking up big drug companies, we should ask if people are financing their campaigns by taking money from big drug executives. If we are going to talk about Wall Street and having some serious regulation over Wall Street, we should ask if people are funding their campaigns by taking money from those executives.",

      "author": "Thomas Kaplan",
      "content": " Former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke suggested at Tuesday night\u2019s debate that Senator Elizabeth Warren was being \u201cpunitive\u201d as she argues for a tax on the wealth of the richest Americans, a proposal that is a centerpiece of her presidential campaign. \u201cSometimes I think that Senator Warren is more focused on being punitive or pitting some part of the country against the other, instead of lifting people up and making sure that this country comes together around those solutions,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke said, even as he said that a wealth tax was \u201cpart of the solution\u201d for addressing income inequality. Ms. Warren has proposed creating an annual tax on wealth that would apply to households with a net worth above $50 million. She would put in place a 2 percent tax on a household\u2019s net worth above $50 million, and a 3 percent tax on net worth above $1 billion. Ms. Warren would use the revenue from that tax \u2014 just two cents of every dollar over $50 million, as she explains it to crowds \u2014 to finance programs like universal child care, student debt cancellation and tuition-free public college. On the campaign trail, Ms. Warren takes care to emphasize that she is not seeking to punish the super rich, telling audiences that she is not proposing a wealth tax because she is \u201ccranky.\u201d In response to Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s comments, she said she was \u201creally shocked at the notion that anyone thinks I\u2019m punitive.\u201d \u201cLook, I don\u2019t have a beef with billionaires,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cYou made a fortune in America, you had a great idea, you got out there and worked for it, good for you.\u201d Ms. Warren then made an argument she is fond of making on the campaign trail \u2014 one that attracted attention back in 2011, the year before she was elected to the Senate. People who have built a fortune in the United States, she said on Tuesday, \u201cbuilt it in part using workers all of us helped pay to educate.\u201d \u201cYou built it in part getting your goods to market on roads and bridges all of us helped pay for,\u201d she continued. \u201cYou built it at least in part protected by police and firefighters all of us helped pay the salaries for. And all I\u2019m saying is, you make it to the top, the top one-tenth of 1 percent, then pitch in two cents so every other kid in America has a chance to make it. That\u2019s what this is about.\u201d",

HerndonPRINT EDITIONWarren Campaign Fires Staff Member for \u2018Inappropriate Behavior\u2019|October 5, 2019",
      "author": "Astead W. Herndon",
      "content": " Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts fired her national organizing director after \u201cmultiple complaints regarding inappropriate behavior,\u201d according to a statement released Friday by her communications director. The campaign hired the staff member, Richard McDaniel, earlier this year to head the national field operations, a job that involved spearheading the campaign\u2019s organizing structure and outreach programs. The statement by Ms. Warren\u2019s communications director, Kristen Orthman, said senior campaign leadership had received multiple complaints about Mr. McDaniel\u2019s behavior \u201cover the past two weeks.\u201d The decision to fire him came after an investigation conducted by outside counsel. \u201cBased on the results of the investigation, the campaign determined that his reported conduct was inconsistent with its values and that he could not be a part of the campaign moving forward,\u201d Ms. Orthman said. Ms. Orthman declined to elaborate on the nature of the complaints. Politico was first to report that Mr. McDaniel had been dismissed. The news came the same day that the Warren campaign reported having raised $24.6 million in the most recent fund-raising quarter, a total that offered further evidence of Ms. Warren\u2019s steady rise to the top of the Democratic primary field. Mr. McDaniel was a veteran of several Democratic campaigns, most recently serving as a senior campaign aide to Senator Doug Jones, who defeated a Republican challenger in a closely watched special election in Alabama in 2017. Before that, he worked for Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign. Reached by phone, Mr. McDaniel said \u201cdeparting at this time is in the best interest of both parties.\u201d \u201cI would never intentionally engage in any behavior inconsistent with the campaign or my own values,\u201d he said. \u201cIf others feel that I have, I understand it is important to listen even when you disagree. I wish the campaign and my colleagues well.\u201d Ms. Warren, speaking to reporters on Friday in Los Angeles after the firing was announced, said that when she started in campaign, she put in place procedures to deal with any complaints, and that process was followed in this case. \u201cIt is really hard for anyone to come forward with a complaint or with a concern, and the people who did that showed incredible courage,\u201d she said. When he was hired, Mr. McDaniel's expertise in galvanizing black voters was touted as a boon to Ms. Warren, whose populist brand has so far held more sway in white elite circles than black ones. According to sources familiar with the campaign, there had been discontent with Mr. McDaniel\u2019s job performance even before the complaints regarding his behavior arose.",

      "author": "Maggie Astor",
      "content": "  We here on The New York Times Politics desk had a busy and exciting week helping to host the fourth Democratic debate. Tuesday night was especially frenetic, with the debate, third-quarter fund-raising reports and a pair of major endorsements all in the news. As always, we\u2019re here to step back and sort it all out for you. Here\u2019s a rundown of the major moments of the week. Thanks to her newfound front-runner status, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts was everyone\u2019s target on Tuesday night. She fielded criticism on her proposed wealth tax, on the cost of \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d and on her decision not to urge Twitter to suspend President Trump\u2019s account. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, appearing at his first event since his heart attack two weeks earlier, seemed like his old self and aimed to dispel some of the concerns about his health. And Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota had big nights, sparring with Ms. Warren and setting themselves up as moderate voters\u2019 alternatives to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr, who largely faded into the background. Tuesday was the deadline for candidates to file their third-quarter reports with the Federal Election Commission. Our colleagues compiled the fund-raising totals, analyzed how they compared to previous quarters, and created a graphic that shows who\u2019s up and who\u2019s down in the money race. The candidates also provided a few surprising top lines: Mr. Biden is relatively low on cash; about half the field spent more money in the third quarter than they took in; and Tom Steyer, a billionaire former hedge fund manager who is largely self-financing his campaign, spent $47 million in the past months. But the real oddity was on the other end of the spectrum. Mayor Wayne Messam of Miramar, Fla., reported raising a grand total of five (5) dollars from July through September. As the three-hour debate was winding down on Tuesday, word came that Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a progressive political star from New York, was planning to endorse Mr. Sanders at a rally this weekend. Representative Ilhan Omar, a Minnesota Democrat, soon gave her support to Mr. Sanders, too, scoring him a highly coveted endorsement two weeks after his heart attack. Both women are among the first-term Democratic women of color known as \u201cthe squad.\u201d The other two members of the group, Representatives Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ayanna S. Pressley of Massachusetts, have not made a presidential endorsement. In a speech on Thursday at Georgetown University, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, argued forcefully against the idea that the social network should be an arbiter of speech, doubling down on a stance that has drawn wide condemnation as the company continues to face accusations of amplifying disinformation. Ms. Warren renewed that criticism after Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s speech, saying late Thursday in a tweet: \u201cFacebook is actively helping Trump spread lies and misinformation. Facebook already helped elect Donald Trump once. They might do it again \u2014 and profit off of it.\u201d The comments continued an increasingly public feud between Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Warren. Earlier this month, Ms. Warren bought a political ad on Facebook that purposefully included the false claim that Mr. Zuckerberg and Facebook backed Mr. Trump\u2019s re-election \u2014 and essentially dared the social network to remove it. (Neither Mr. Zuckerberg nor Facebook has endorsed a candidate.) Mr. Zuckerberg at one point invoked the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to make his point about free speech, which drew a response from one of Dr. King\u2019s daughters, Bernice King. \u201cI\u2019d like to help Facebook better understand the challenges #MLK faced from disinformation campaigns launched by politicians,\u201d she wrote on Twitter. \u201cThese campaigns created an atmosphere for his assassination.\u201d On Tuesday, Ms. Warren also announced that she would not take any contributions over $200 from executives at big tech companies, big banks, private equity firms or hedge funds. Several Democrats released policy proposals this week, many of which echoed ideas from their rivals. We leave you with this photo of Mr. Steyer and his tie. Your humble hosts are not experts in neckwear, but lucky for you, Vanessa Friedman \u2014 The Times\u2019s fashion director and chief fashion critic \u2014 actually is. She has written a piece containing everything you ever wanted to know about the tie, its Twitter account(s), Mr. Steyer\u2019s penchant for tartan and, well, you get the idea. This is a rabbit hole. We welcome you down it.",

      "author": "Inyoung Kang",
      "content": " Good morning.  On Tuesday, months after Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts first unveiled her proposal to break up Facebook and other tech giants, The Verge published highlights from two hours of leaked audio in which Mark Zuckerberg railed against Facebook critics, competitors and Ms. Warren. Our political correspondent Matt Stevens covered Ms. Warren\u2019s response to the remarks: Remember that giant billboard near the Caltrain station in San Francisco? The one with Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s face on it? The one that said in all capital letters: \u201cBREAK UP BIG TECH\u201d? With Ms. Warren seeking the Democratic nomination for president, her campaign put up that billboard over the summer after she rolled out her plans to regulate the tech industry. One needs only to look to the billboard for evidence that she wanted to make very sure tech workers got her message. On Tuesday we learned that, yes, in fact, they did get the memo \u2014 and that at least one of Silicon Valley\u2019s power players is not a fan. \u201cIf she gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge,\u201d Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, said of Ms. Warren and her plan, according to leaked recordings of comments he made to Facebook employees. \u201cDoes that still suck for us? Yeah. I mean, I don\u2019t want to have a major lawsuit against our own government. That\u2019s not like the position you want to be in. We care about our country and want to work with our government to do good things,\u201d he added. \u201cBut look, at the end of the day, if someone\u2019s going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight.\u201d Ms. Warren has built her campaign around a call for \u201cbig, structural change\u201d and has garnered significant support by releasing a series of detailed policy proposals like the one on how she would break up giant tech companies. Shortly after The Verge published Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s remarks, Ms. Warren responded on Twitter. And she did not mince words. \u201cWhat would really \u2018suck,\u2019\u201d she said, mimicking Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s language, \u201cis if we don\u2019t fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights, and repeatedly fumble their responsibility to protect our democracy.\u201d The exchanges didn\u2019t end there. Mr. Zuckerberg commented on the situation later on Tuesday in a Facebook post, and Ms. Warren again took to Twitter, firing off a five-tweet thread that began: \u201cLet\u2019s talk a bit about my plan to #BreakUpBigTech and why it\u2019s got Mark Zuckerberg so worked up.\u201d The episode had the effect of publicly pitting one of the leading Democratic presidential candidates against the chief executive of the world\u2019s largest social network.

For now, Joe Biden has far deeper support.By Thomas KaplanPRINT EDITIONWarren Is Courting Black Voters,  But She Has a Lot of Work to Do|October 7, 2019, Page A1",
      "author": "Thomas Kaplan",
      "content": " ROCK HILL, S.C. \u2014 For her most recent rally in South Carolina, Senator Elizabeth Warren chose Clinton College, a historically black institution in this racially diverse city. Her campaign handed out signs reading, \u201cAfrican Americans With Warren.\u201d And in smaller print: \u201cBlack issues are American issues.\u201d But when Ms. Warren looked out at the audience, she saw mostly white faces. The view reflected perhaps her biggest political challenge as she seeks the Democratic presidential nomination: adding black voters to her base of support. African-Americans were critical to Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and Bill Clinton winning competitive primary contests and capturing the nomination. Like those earlier candidates, Ms. Warren faces multiple rivals who may splinter the electorate this winter, and running up the vote margin in predominantly black areas could once again deliver troves of delegates needed for the nomination. While Ms. Warren is rising in polls thanks to support among liberals, women, young people and college-educated whites, black voters, who are the most essential part of the traditional Democratic coalition, have yet to embrace her in large numbers. \u201cI just think people don\u2019t know her yet,\u201d said Kim Ume, 51, who came to see Ms. Warren in Rock Hill. But Ms. Ume, like some other black admirers here, was hopeful: \u201cAll she needs to do is put herself in front of people.\u201d Part of Ms. Warren\u2019s challenge is that her leading rival, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., appears to have strong support among black Democrats, which could help him in delegate-rich states with heavily black districts like the Carolinas, Texas and Virginia that hold early primaries. (In interviews with black voters in South Carolina recently, President Trump\u2019s attacks on Mr. Biden over Ukraine did not appear to worry them.) Senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, the two leading black Democrats in the race, are also courting African-American voters. But more broadly, Ms. Warren is running an ideologically left-wing campaign and basing her appeal on policy proposals more so than longstanding relationships and endorsements. Senator Bernie Sanders ran a similar campaign in 2016 and lost black voters in landslides to Mrs. Clinton, who was better known and had key allies among black leaders, most importantly Mr. Obama. Ms. Warren has several months to build ties, of course, but many black voters measure political relationships in years, not months. \u201cI\u2019ve heard very little about her,\u201d Charles Rodgers, 57, said after leaving a library in downtown Columbia. He said he had not yet paid close attention to the primary race, given the size of the field. The clear deficit with black votes stands out in part because, on so many other fronts, Ms. Warren is excelling. She is now running closely with Mr. Biden in polls in the first two states to vote, Iowa and New Hampshire, where the electorate is overwhelmingly white. She is well positioned to navigate the rushing political waters of impeachment, having called for the House to begin impeachment proceedings as far back as April. And the sizable crowd in Rock Hill, which her campaign put at 1,400, was another sign of the palpable interest in her candidacy. At the same time, the largely white audience was only the latest sign that she still has a long way to go in increasing her support among black voters. Six weeks earlier, when she held a rally in Aiken, S.C., the crowd that turned out was also predominantly white. Asked recently about her limited support among black voters, Ms. Warren refrained from offering a political analysis. Instead, she ticked off a number of policy issues that are important to African-Americans, and that she has plans to address, such as housing and maternal mortality. \u201cThe way I see this is that African-American women have really been the backbone of the Democratic Party for generations now,\u201d Ms. Warren said as she spoke with reporters. \u201cThey get out there and they fight for people. And what I\u2019m doing is showing up and trying to talk to people about why I\u2019m in this fight.\u201d Six in 10 voters in South Carolina\u2019s Democratic primary in 2016 were black, and they favored Mrs. Clinton over Mr. Sanders by 72 percentage points, according to exit polls. This time, it is Mr. Biden who is counting on black voters to propel him to a victory in South Carolina, the fourth state to hold a nominating contest in 2020. In a CNN poll released last week, Mr. Biden was supported by 37 percent of likely voters in South Carolina over all, followed by Ms. Warren with 16 percent. Among white voters in the state, they were neck-and-neck, at 29 percent and 28 percent, respectively. But Ms. Warren was all but invisible among black voters: Mr. Biden was supported by 45 percent, compared with just 4 percent for Ms. Warren. A Fox News poll released on Sunday and a Winthrop University poll released last week painted similar pictures of Mr. Biden far ahead of Ms. Warren among black voters in the state. A national poll released by Quinnipiac University last month offered a brighter outlook for Ms. Warren: It found her at 19 percent among black voters, an improvement of nine percentage points from a poll conducted a month earlier. Interviews with black voters at Ms. Warren\u2019s rally in Rock Hill and elsewhere in South Carolina showed the steepness of the challenge she faces in spreading the word about her candidacy \u2014 but also the enthusiasm she generates among voters whom she has been able to reach. After attending worship services at Zion Baptist Church in downtown Columbia on a recent Sunday, Ty Washington, 66, said he favored Mr. Biden, citing his experience and his time in the Obama administration. He was not drawn to Ms. Warren in the same way. \u201cI like her ideas, but she doesn\u2019t come across as strong to me,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not her being a woman, because I can deal with women rulers. It\u2019s something about her that just does not resonate with me, because she speaks well, she talks well, but she doesn\u2019t have that strength that I think we need in a presidential candidate.\u201d Denise Hodges, 63, Mr. Washington\u2019s cousin, also favored Mr. Biden. \u201cI never followed her as close as I\u2019ve been following him,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause we\u2019ve been seeing him, we\u2019re used to him, so we\u2019re comfortable.\u201d Asked whom he liked in the 2020 race, the Rev. Israel Gist, 81, an associate minister at the church, quickly offered a name: Mr. Biden. Then he offered another. \u201cWhat\u2019s her name? Warren?\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s coming along pretty well.\u201d But he immediately quickly flagged a concern. \u201cI don\u2019t think pushing \u2018Medicare for all\u2019 is a winning strategy,\u201d he said, referring to her support of a single-payer health care system, a key difference between her and Mr. Biden. Part of the challenge facing Ms. Warren is the warm feelings that many black voters have for Mr. Biden after he served two terms as Mr. Obama\u2019s vice president. \u201cI think it\u2019s really hard for candidates like Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, anybody, when you\u2019re going against Joe Biden, who can drop, \u2018Obama, Obama,\u2019 and African-Americans are like, \u2018Yes, yes,\u2019\u201d said Jazmine Curenton, 19, who came to a block party for Mr. Booker in Columbia. Mr. Biden\u2019s reputation may be particularly hard for Ms. Warren to overcome among older voters. \u201cI think that there are a lot of younger people who not only are really open to her, but truly like her and truly like what she\u2019s saying,\u201d said Uchechi Kalu, 26, who has canvassed for Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign and attended her event in Rock Hill. \u201cAnd then there\u2019s an older generation that is sticking to people who are familiar with the Democratic base.\u201d Ms. Warren\u2019s team is counting on her standing to improve as she becomes more familiar to black voters. \u201cWhat we see is that folks who have an opinion, and have heard of Elizabeth Warren, tend to have a favorable opinion and like her,\u201d Joe Rospars, the Warren campaign\u2019s chief strategist, said in a podcast interview with David Plouffe, who managed Mr. Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign. \u201cWhat we also see is that people of color are disproportionately likely to not have heard of, and not have an opinion about, Elizabeth Warren.\u201d Ms. Warren is making a concerted effort to build relationships with black leaders. \u201cEvery couple of weeks, she\u2019ll call just out of nowhere,\u201d said the Rev. Al Sharpton, who has yet to endorse a candidate. When Mr. Sharpton became a grandfather late last year, Ms. Warren was quick to offer congratulations. And last month, when Mr. Sharpton received an award and gave a speech at the annual Congressional Black Caucus Foundation dinner in Washington, he immediately received a text from Ms. Warren. \u201cShe\u2019s the only one that does that,\u201d he said. \u201cFriends of mine didn\u2019t text.\u201d Beyond personal overtures, Ms. Warren is leaning on what has been a defining quality of her campaign: producing policy plan after policy plan on a wide range of subjects. Racial justice is a common thread throughout her proposals. Her housing plan would provide down payment assistance to first-time home buyers who live in formerly redlined neighborhoods. She has a plan to reduce maternal mortality among black women, who die of pregnancy-related causes at a much higher rate than white women. She has a proposal to provide grants to minority entrepreneurs, and her child care plan would raise the wages of child care workers, who are disproportionately women of color. Her higher education plan calls for providing at least $50 billion for historically black colleges and universities as well as minority-serving institutions, and her campaign has made a point of highlighting how her student debt cancellation plan would help narrow the black-white wealth gap in America. Ms. Warren also has a powerful partner for her debt cancellation plan, which is being sponsored in the House by Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, the majority whip and the highest-ranking African-American in Congress. On Wednesday, she will join Mr. Clyburn at a town hall on student debt at his alma mater, South Carolina State University, a historically black college in Orangeburg. \u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of plans,\u201d Ms. Warren said, \u201cand what I want to do is talk to people about all of them.\u201d ",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 When a half-dozen Democratic donors gathered at the Whitby Hotel in Manhattan last week, the dinner began with a discussion of which presidential candidates the contributors liked. But as conversations among influential Democrats often go these days, the meeting quickly evolved into a discussion of who was not in the race \u2014 but could be lured in. Would Hillary Clinton get in, the contributors wondered, and how about Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York mayor? One person even mused whether Michelle Obama would consider a late entry, according to two people who attended the event, which was hosted by the progressive group American Bridge. It\u2019s that time of the election season for Democrats. \u201cSince the last debate, just anecdotally, I\u2019ve had five or six people ask me: \u2018Is there anybody else?\u2019\u201d said Leah Daughtry, a longtime Democrat who has run two of the party\u2019s recent conventions. With doubts rising about former Vice President Joseph R. Biden\u2019s ability to finance a multistate primary campaign, persistent questions about Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s viability in the general election and skepticism that Mayor Pete Buttigieg, of South Bend, Ind., can broaden his appeal beyond white voters, Democratic leaders are engaging in a familiar rite: fretting about who is in the race and longing for a white knight to enter the contest at the last minute. It is a regular, if not quite quadrennial, tradition for a party that can be fatalistic about its prospects and recalls similar Maalox moments Democrats endured in 1992, 2004 and in the last primary, when it was Mr. Biden who nearly entered the race in October. But the mood of alarm is even more intense because of the party\u2019s hunger to defeat President Trump and \u2014 with just over three months to go before voting starts in Iowa \u2014 their impatience with finding Mr. or Mrs. Right among the current crop of candidates. \u201cThere\u2019s more anxiety than ever,\u201d said Connie Schultz, a journalist who is married to Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, another Democrat who some in the party would like to see join the race. \u201cWe\u2019re both getting the calls. I\u2019ve been surprised by some who\u2019ve called me.\u201d \u201cI can see it, I can feel it, I can hear it,\u201d Mitch Landrieu, the former New Orleans mayor, said of the unease within the party. He said he thinks Mr. Biden is best positioned to defeat Mr. Trump but called the former vice president\u2019s fund-raising \u201ca real concern.\u201d Mr. Biden\u2019s lackluster debate performances and alarmingly low cash flow \u2014 he has less than $9 million on hand, not even half of some of his rivals \u2014 has fueled the Democratic disquiet. But if the causes of the concern are plain to see, what exactly can be done about it is less clear. And even some of those being wooed acknowledge that it can be hard to discern between people just being nice and those who genuinely want them in the race. Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Bloomberg have both told people privately in recent weeks that if they thought they could win, they would consider entering the primary \u2014 but that they were skeptical there would be an opening, according to Democrats who have spoken with them. Former Secretary of State John F. Kerry, who associates say has wondered aloud about whether he should have run and has found it hard to watch Mr. Biden\u2019s missteps, has also been urged to get in. But he still thinks the former vice president, who was once his longtime Senate colleague, is the party\u2019s best nominee. Another Obama administration official who weighed a campaign at the start of the year, former Attorney General Eric Holder, is considering a last-minute entry but has conceded it may be too late, according to a Democrat familiar with his thinking. Mr. Brown, who nearly entered the race earlier this year, said the pressure on him to reconsider from labor leaders, Democratic officials and donors has \u201cbecome more frequent.\u201d And Deval Patrick, the former Massachusetts governor, who also weighed a campaign run before deciding not to, said he too has been nudged by friends to reconsider. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to be rumored about,\u201d he said, before notably refusing to rule out a last-minute entry. \u201cDon\u2019t ask me that question,\u201d he said. But Mr. Patrick suggested an 11th-hour bid was highly unlikely and had a message for increasingly angst-ridden Democrats: \u201cEverybody needs to calm down, it\u2019s early. It\u2019s so early.\u201d The chances that another major contender decides to run are remote: While Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Bloomberg have both been encouraged to enter the race, Democrats close to them believe the only scenario under which they\u2019d consider running is if Mr. Biden drops out or is badly weakened. Neither is likely to take place before the end of this calendar year, at which point the filing deadline to be on the primary ballot in large Super Tuesday states like California and Texas will have passed. But that\u2019s not stopping the speculation, which has only grown of late thanks in part to the 2016 Democratic nominee\u2019s public comments. Mrs. Clinton, after largely staying in the  background of the Democratic primary, has been more vocal this month, promoting a book she wrote with her daughter and taunting Mr. Trump on Twitter. She also opened a feud with Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii by claiming the long-shot candidate was being supported by the Russians, as a potential third-party spoiler in the general election. Democrats who have recently spoken with Mrs. Clinton say she shares the same concerns other party elites have about the field \u2014 worried about Mr. Biden\u2019s durability, Ms. Warren\u2019s liberal politics and unsure of who else can emerge to take on Mr. Trump. But these people, who spoke anonymously to discuss private conversations, say she enjoys the freedom that comes with not being on the ballot.\n\nMr. Bloomberg is said to be more eager to find a way into the race \u2014 and chatter about his potential candidacy has only grown among Democrats who work on Wall Street and are concerned about Ms. Warren\u2019s rise. He raised some eyebrows recently by putting off a fund-raising request from one third-party Democratic group until he knew about his own intentions, according to two Democrats familiar with the conversation. But the former New York mayor has flirted with presidential runs before, only to pull back. Friends say he recognizes his long odds at this stage of the race and his advisers suggest he will play a significant financial role in the 2020 race without his name on the ballot. Still, it\u2019s unlikely that the what-if musing, particularly among the party\u2019s class of donors, elected officials and strategists, will quiet down as long as Mr. Biden is struggling and Ms. Warren, the Massachusetts senator, is surging. \u201cWith Trump looming, there is genuine concern that the horse many have bet on may be pulling up lame and the horse who has sprinted out front may not be able to win,\u201d said David Axelrod, a former adviser to President Barack Obama.\n\nWhile much of the daydreaming about a last-minute entry comes from pro-business Democrats, it is not confined to the wealthy. Mr. Brown and Ms. Schultz noted that they were hearing from a broad range of people but declined to offer any names. He said he was staying out of the race and had no regrets. The Ohio senator said he was confident Democrats would eventually rally behind their nominee, but he warned the party not to embrace a single-payer health care plan that eliminates private insurance. \u201cI think it\u2019ll be a hard sell to the public if we go into the general election for \u2018Medicare for all,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Brown, citing the risk of alienating union workers who would lose their negotiated plans. One longtime Democrat who originally sought to entice Mr. Brown into the race, Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, could not help letting out a loud \u201coy!\u201d when asked about the possibility of another candidate joining the sprawling field. \u201cFor as long as I have been in politics, I\u2019ve heard Democrats fretting about their presidential contenders,\u201d said Ms. Weingarten. Indeed, for some Democrats, the grass is always greener outside their field. There were multiple stages of the 1992 primary when Bill Clinton\u2019s candidacy was seen as doomed, either because of his own vulnerabilities or because of the third-party threat of H. Ross Perot. Would-be Democratic saviors that year included Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York, former Senators Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, Sam Nunn of Georgia and Al Gore of Tennessee, and Representative Richard Gephardt of Missouri. In the 2004 race, Mr. Gore was again sought after as a potential candidate. That race evolved along similar lines to the current primary, with Democrats desperate to oust an incumbent Republican (George W. Bush) but nervous that their front-runner into the fall (Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont) would prove unelectable as the nominee. That time, a candidate did come in relatively late in the race, Wesley K. Clark, a retired general, but he gained little traction and Mr. Kerry ultimately won the nomination. At this time four years ago, it was Mr. Biden who some Democrats were hoping would join the race to offer the party another option besides Mrs. Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Mr. Biden, of course, decided not to run. But now it\u2019s his own candidacy that\u2019s prompting a familiar call for the cavalry, or at least one horse-bound white knight. \u201cIf Biden were surging, I doubt you would be hearing this,\u201d said Harold Ickes, a longtime Democratic consultant. \u201cThis shows a restlessness among a lot of people.\u201d",

      "author": "Thomas Kaplan",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 It is one of Elizabeth Warren\u2019s signature anecdotes in her stump speech: By the end of her first year as a public-school teacher, she was \u201cvisibly pregnant,\u201d and the principal wished her luck and hired another teacher to replace her. In recent days, a conservative news site and other outlets have cited evidence that challenges her account, including past remarks by Ms. Warren in which she did not mention being forced to leave the school and minutes from a school board meeting showing that her contract was initially extended for the next school year. Ms. Warren is now pushing back against any suggestion that she has misrepresented the circumstances of her departure, and pointing to the discrimination that many pregnant women have faced on the job. The school board did extend her contract early in her pregnancy, before the school knew about it, she said in an interview with CBS News. But two months later, when it was clear that she was pregnant, she lost the job. \u201cWhen I was 22 and finishing my first year of teaching, I had an experience millions of women will recognize,\u201d she wrote on Twitter. \u201cBy June I was visibly pregnant \u2014 and the principal told me the job I\u2019d already been promised for the next year would go to someone else.\u201d She added: \u201cThis was 1971, years before Congress outlawed pregnancy discrimination \u2014 but we know it still happens in subtle and not-so-subtle ways. We can fight back by telling our stories. I tell mine on the campaign trail, and I hope to hear yours.\u201d Ms. Warren did not name the principal in her tweets. News accounts show that the principal at the time was Edward Pruzinsky. He died in 1999. Ms. Warren has frequently cited her experience with pregnancy discrimination as she has laid out her political biography to voters, explaining why she went from a public-school teaching career into law and eventually politics, and how her professional development was affected by a form of workplace bias that many women encounter. Historically, it was common for American teachers to be pushed out of their jobs during pregnancy, either through termination or the requirement of an unpaid leave of absence. In 1974, the Supreme Court ruled some of these policies unconstitutional. But not all such policies were explicitly written down and tracked, giving many female teachers little legal recourse. CBS News quoted a retired teacher from Ms. Warren\u2019s school, Trudy Randall, who suggested Ms. Warren would have been unwelcome at the school given her pregnancy. \u201cThe rule was at five months you had to leave when you were pregnant. Now, if you didn\u2019t tell anybody you were pregnant, and they didn\u2019t know, you could fudge it and try to stay on a little bit longer,\u201d Ms. Randall was quoted as saying. \u201cBut they kind of wanted you out if you were pregnant.\u201d At issue are the circumstances that brought to an end Ms. Warren\u2019s brief career as a special needs teacher at an elementary school in Riverdale, N.J., where she worked from 1970 to 1971, when she was just out of college. On the campaign trail, Ms. Warren\u2019s personal story is a central part of her stump speech, beginning with her upbringing in Oklahoma and, eventually, her experience as a teacher. As Ms. Warren tells it, she had wanted to be a teacher since she was in second grade. \u201cI loved that work, and I would probably still be doing that work today, but my story has some more turns,\u201d she told a crowd in Nevada last week. \u201cBy the end of the first year, I was visibly pregnant, and the principal did what principals did in those days: wished me luck and hired someone else for the job.\u201d She included a similar account in her 2014 memoir. In some retellings earlier this year, she said the principal \u201cshowed me the door.\u201d In a post on Twitter last week, Meagan Day, a writer for the socialist magazine Jacobin, drew attention to an interview Ms. Warren gave in 2007 in which she discussed the end of her career as a public-school teacher and did not describe being forced out because she was pregnant. Ms. Warren recalled going back to school because she lacked the education courses she needed. \u201cI went back to graduate school and took a couple of courses in education and said, \u2018I don\u2019t think this is going to work out for me,\u2019\u201d Ms. Warren said in the interview. Addressing the differences in her accounts, Ms. Warren said in a statement to CBS News, \u201cAfter becoming a public figure I opened up more about different pieces in my life and this was one of them.\u201d On Monday, a conservative website, The Washington Free Beacon, published minutes from meetings of the Riverdale Board of Education that referred to her employment status. Minutes of a meeting on April 21, 1971, show that the board approved the issuance of a contract for Ms. Warren\u2019s second year. \u201cMrs. Elizabeth Warren \u2014 2 days per week, Speech,\u201d the minutes say. Ms. Warren told CBS News that she had been hiding her pregnancy. \u201cI was pregnant, but nobody knew it,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then a couple of months later when I was six months pregnant and it was pretty obvious, the principal called me in, wished me luck and said he was going to hire someone else for the job.\u201d Minutes of another school board meeting on June 16, 1971, say that Ms. Warren\u2019s resignation, effective June 30, \u201cwas accepted with regret.\u201d Ms. Warren\u2019s first child, Amelia, was born that September. The Republican National Committee said Tuesday that Ms. Warren had been \u201ccaught lying.\u201d Pregnancy discrimination can begin as soon as women reveal they are pregnant, or are visibly showing, and can continue to affect them for years. In physically demanding jobs, pregnant women risk being fired if they ask to take rest breaks, and in the corporate world, women and mothers may be steered away from prestigious assignments or excluded from client meetings if a boss perceives them to be less committed to their work than other employees. Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, wrote on Twitter about Ms. Warren\u2019s experience, \u201cThis happened to women ALL the time.\u201d Congress passed the Pregnancy Discrimination Act in 1978, which made it illegal to treat pregnant women differently from other people \u201csimilar in their ability or inability to work.\u201d But the law did not solve the problem. Employers argued successfully in court that pregnant workers were comparable to people who got injured off the job, and did not deserve to be accommodated. Although many American companies have made efforts to become more welcoming to women and retain mothers, pregnancy discrimination remains widespread. Joan C. Williams, the founding director of the Center for WorkLife Law at the University of California Hastings College of the Law, called it the \u201cstrongest form of gender discrimination there is.\u201d",

      "author": "Dana Goldstein",
      "content": "  Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts had released dozens of policy plans before tackling K-12 education, making her the last leading Democratic primary contender to do so. But on Monday, the candidate who speaks frequently about her time as a public-school teacher offered her long-awaited proposal: a characteristically dense white paper that promises to quadruple federal funding for schools that serve low-income students, and to pump tens of billions of new dollars per year into desegregation, special education, bilingual programs and mental health support, while increasing federal oversight of racial and gender discrimination in schools. The plan would be paid for by Ms. Warren\u2019s signature wealth tax on net worth over $50 million. To encourage states to spend more on low-income students, those that fund poor and rich schools more equally would be awarded new federal dollars. And it proposes a mix of housing and educational strategies to racially integrate schools, such as inclusive zoning to make it easier to build affordable housing in areas with quality schools, and magnet schools to draw students outside their neighborhoods. Many of these policies enjoy wide support among Democrats. But the Warren campaign also chose a clear side in the party\u2019s long-running education war by vowing to end \u201chigh-stakes testing\u201d and federal funding for opening new charter schools, and to ban for-profit charters, which make up about 15 percent of the sector. \u201cPublic education is for everyone, and I believe in it,\u201d she said on Monday, speaking to students at Theodore Roosevelt High School in Des Moines. She added, \u201cLet\u2019s make every school in America a great school.\u201d Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont issued a similar proposal on charters in May. Charter schools are publicly funded but privately managed, and most are not unionized. Like Mr. Sanders, Ms. Warren offers little to the bipartisan group of school reformers who fought, under Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, to support the charter school movement and to hold schools and teachers accountable for student test scores. Those policies have become less popular in recent years, as a coalition of parent activists and restive teachers protested, saying they drew tax dollars away from traditional schools and put pressure on educators to spend too much time preparing students for exams. In his own education plan, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. did not mention charter schools or testing, a sign, perhaps, of the sensitivity of those subjects among Democrats. Mr. Biden proposed tripling federal funding for low-income schools and, like Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders, supported bringing health services into schools. Democrats for Education Reform, a group that supports charters and tougher accountability for teachers and schools, has met with most of the leading candidates. Charles Barone, the group\u2019s chief policy officer, said that while he welcomed big new investments in education, including in teacher pay, he was disappointed that the primary contenders had not tackled specific problems such as weaknesses in how educators are trained to teach children to read. \u201cThere is a political tension between spreading the money around and trying to make strategic investments in certain areas,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of meat and potatoes, but not a lot of spinach-eating getting proposed.\u201d Before she entered politics, Ms. Warren suggested a program allowing parents to choose any public school for their children, regardless of where the family lived. That vision aligned with many in the charter school movement, who see their schools as lifelines for families who cannot afford private school tuition or a home in a coveted school zone. But in 2016, Ms. Warren, then in her first term as a senator from Massachusetts, spoke out against a ballot referendum that would have raised the cap on the number of charters that could open each year in her home state. She acknowledged that many Massachusetts charter schools were high-performing, but said that opening too many additional charters could reduce funding for traditional public schools. Ms. Warren and her Democratic rivals are vying for endorsements from teachers\u2019 unions, which generally oppose the expansion of the charter sector. \u201cThe focus is on making sure every single neighborhood public school is a great school,\u201d said Bharat Ramamurti, an economic policy adviser to Ms. Warren. The unions have experienced a burst of energy and public support over the past two years, as teachers in a string of states and cities mounted walkouts in favor of higher pay and more school funding, and against competition from charters. Teachers in Chicago, the nation\u2019s third-largest school district, are now on strike, and Ms. Warren has offered her support. She has proposed policies that would make it easier for unions to organize teachers and other workers, and easier for employees to strike. On teacher pay, Ms. Warren\u2019s plan promises new federal funding but does not offer as much detail as a proposal by Senator Kamala Harris of California, which supports an average teacher raise of $13,500 per year, with more money for teachers in low-income schools. \u201cWe have to get a little edgier than just, \u2018Pay teachers more,\u2019\u201d said Paul Reville, a professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education and a former Massachusetts secretary of education. He suggested that in addition to a broad anti-poverty agenda, candidates should support a longer school day and year, with afternoon and summer enrichment activities that could help children from low-income families keep up with more affluent peers. \u201cWe have millions of children who are being grossly underprepared for the 21st-century labor market, to say nothing of citizenship in a complex democracy,\u201d he said. Ms. Warren has steadily gained momentum in the Democratic primary contest, and she now stands as a front-runner alongside Mr. Biden. Last week\u2019s debate, in which she was the target of a barrage of attacks from other candidates, was indicative of her perceived strength in the race. On the campaign trail, Ms. Warren often tells crowds that she had dreamed of becoming a public-school teacher ever since the second grade, recounting how she lost her job after her first year as a special needs teacher because she became pregnant. She has said she would appoint a former public-school teacher as education secretary and, six months ago, Ms. Warren released a higher education plan that calls for canceling student loan debt and eliminating tuition at public colleges. She has also proposed expanding access to free preschool and capping child care expenses at 7 percent of parents\u2019 income, with free child care for low-income families.",

      "author": "Mitch Smith",
      "content": " CHICAGO \u2014 Senator Elizabeth Warren waded into the crowd outside a Chicago elementary school on Tuesday morning, offering hugs and handshakes and words of support for more than 20,000 teachers whose strike had canceled classes for four days in the country\u2019s third-largest school district. \u201cThe unions are how we have a voice,\u201d said Ms. Warren, one of several Democrats running for president who have expressed support for the strike, which showed no sign of ending. \u201cThe unions are how we have power. The unions are how we make sure that the needs of every one of our children are heard loud and clear.\u201d The rush by Ms. Warren and other Democratic candidates to defend the striking teachers \u2014\u00a0 Senator Bernie Sanders attended a rally before the strike, Senator Cory Booker met with union members, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and others have expressed encouragement on Twitter \u2014 conveyed the national resonance of the Chicago union\u2019s demands for more support staff and smaller class sizes. It also reflected a broader shift in their party, as candidates respond to a recent revival of teacher activism across the country and seek to solidify union support ahead of next year\u2019s election. \u201cWhat it\u2019s saying is that the Democratic Party is actually finding its Rooseveltian roots again,\u201d Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, said in an interview. A decade ago, Ms. Weingarten said such an outpouring of support from so many candidates would have been unlikely. Back then, some Democrats joined conservatives in criticizing the power of teachers\u2019 unions. President Barack Obama sometimes criticized the unions as not focused enough on student achievement, and his administration supported nonprofit charter schools, which are generally not unionized. \u201cIt is a real shift,\u201d Ms. Weingarten said. \u201cIt is a change.\u201d David Axelrod, a longtime Chicago political consultant and former adviser to Mr. Obama, said he was not surprised that Democratic candidates were stepping in with support for the Chicago teachers. \u201cThere\u2019s a great deal of competition within the field for support on the left, and there\u2019s a great deal of competition for support from teachers nationally,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cThe other advantage of being a presidential candidate from out of town is that you don\u2019t have to pay for it. Who cannot be in favor of smaller class sizes and more support staff?\u201d Ms. Warren, who often speaks of her own stint as a teacher, and who this week released a plan calling for a quadrupling of federal funds for schools that serve low-income students, arrived on Chicago\u2019s West Side as negotiations between the union and Mayor Lori Lightfoot\u2019s administration appeared to grow more tense. One union member, who addressed the crowd before Ms. Warren spoke, called the mayor \u201cPetty Lori.\u201d Ms. Lightfoot, a Democrat who was elected earlier this year, has talked repeatedly about the school district\u2019s fiscal challenges and has urged teachers to return to work while negotiations continued. Union leaders took offense at the suggestion and said a resolution was not imminent, meaning that more than 300,000 students would remain out of class. \u201cWe\u2019re not going back to work without a legally binding agreement,\u201d said Jesse Sharkey, the union president, on Monday night. \u201cThe mayor today has dashed our hopes for a quick settlement.\u201d In addition to the teachers, a separate union representing thousands of school support workers in Chicago, including classroom aides and security guards, remained on strike Tuesday. Chicago is a heavily Democratic city with a long history of backing labor unions. As teachers have marched through downtown and picketed outside schools in recent days, they have often been greeted by supportive car honks and parents offering apple cider and doughnuts. But Ms. Lightfoot and her predecessor, Rahm Emanuel, whose tenure included an especially bitter teachers\u2019 strike in 2012, have struggled to reconcile demands from the union with the bleak finances of the city and the school system. \u201cBeyond what we put on the table, there is simply no more money,\u201d Ms. Lightfoot said, taking a noticeably harsher tone this week than in the first days of the strike. She added: \u201cEnough is enough. There is no further excuse to keep our kids out of school.\u201d Ms. Lightfoot suggested that she was unsurprised by Ms. Warren\u2019s arrival, but did not expect it to change much for the city. \u201cShe has her right to come in,\u201d Ms. Lightfoot said. \u201cI would expect all Democratic candidates for the presidency to support workers. That\u2019s who we are as a party. But at the end of the day, what\u2019s going to get it done is what happens at the bargaining table.\u201d Republicans were also skeptical of the visit. \u201cTeachers should be wary of any advice Elizabeth Warren may be relaying today in Chicago,\u201d said Kevin Knoth, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee, in a statement that questioned the wisdom of Ms. Warren\u2019s plan for spending billions of dollars more on education. The Rev. Jesse Jackson, who has attended some of the negotiating sessions to try to help reach a deal, said that the candidates weighing in on Chicago\u2019s strike are recognizing a broader problem in paying for what is needed in schools in communities across the country. \u201cThese are not just Chicago\u2019s problems,\u201d Mr. Jackson said. \u201cThey really need to talk about a national plan.\u201d In recent years, teachers have protested their pay or work conditions in liberal cities like Los Angeles and Denver, as well as in conservative states like Oklahoma and West Virginia. Amid that wave of activism, Democrats at all levels of politics have rushed to ingratiate themselves. Leading presidential contenders, including Mr. Sanders, Ms. Warren, Mr. Biden and Senator Kamala Harris of California, have all vied for endorsements from teachers\u2019 unions. The Chicago strike, in particular, has been a favorite topic. Ms. Harris posted earlier this month that she was \u201cin solidarity with Chicago\u2019s teachers.\u201d Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former secretary of Housing and Urban Development, posted a video before the strike calling attention to the demands of Chicago teachers. And on Tuesday morning, as hundreds of red-clad teachers gathered outside an elementary school, Ms. Warren told the cheering crowd that \u201cI\u2019m here to stand for America\u2019s public schools.\u201d \u201cTo have someone like Senator Warren come out,\u201d said Brett Murphy, a high school teacher who attended the speech, \u201cand say, \u2018You know what, I understand why you\u2019re standing here, keep standing here, and don\u2019t give in till it\u2019s over,\u2019 that gives us the boost\u201d to keep fighting.",

      "author": "Sydney Ember",
      "content": " MARSHALLTOWN, Iowa \u2014 On a trip to Iowa in June, Senator Bernie Sanders confided in aides about a central gamble of his second bid for the White House. As nearly two dozen other presidential candidates and their supporters were heading to an Iowa Democratic Party dinner, the first major event of the 2020 election cycle, Mr. Sanders was on his way to march with striking fast-food workers. While such populist gestures have defined Mr. Sanders\u2019s life in politics, he was taking a risk in favoring grass-roots organizing over the party politicking usually essential to winning the Iowa caucuses, as he acknowledged in a car ride to the protest. \u201cThis is going to be hard,\u201d he said, according to an aide who was present. \u201cBut,\u201d he said, using a profanity for emphasis, \u201cthis is the only way we\u2019re going to do it.\u201d Every top Democratic candidate has been making calculations to try to win Iowa\u2019s first-in-the-nation caucus, and, lately, many have been staking their candidacies to a big result on Feb. 3. But Mr. Sanders stands out in several ways: He nearly won Iowa in 2016 against Hillary Clinton and, some allies say, he cannot afford to be anything less than a close runner-up again. He is returning to the state this week after suffering a heart attack that stirred questions about his campaign\u2019s viability. He has the most money in the race but also faces tough competition for liberal voters from a leading Iowa candidate, Senator Elizabeth Warren. And, as his solidarity with the fast-food workers showed, he is trying to strengthen his base of voters by dedicating time and resources to wooing workers, young people, Latinos and others in Iowa, rather than focusing on winning over more party leaders. It is something of a shift from 2016, when Mr. Sanders and his allies were a greater presence at Democratic Party dinners and events to try to compete with Mrs. Clinton. Increasingly, Mr. Sanders and his allies are making it clear that he is determined to win Iowa, even as he faces an uphill battle with about 100 days to go before the caucuses. \u201cI\u2019m here this evening to ask for your help,\u201d he said at a town hall-style event in Marshalltown on Thursday. \u201cI don\u2019t have to tell anybody in this room that Iowa plays a very disproportionately large role in the political process.\u201d Mr. Sanders continues to lag Ms. Warren and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. in polls. As candidates like Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., nip at his heels, his campaign has zeroed in on Iowa, viewing it as critical to his chances of winning the Democratic nomination, according to several people familiar with his strategy. Some advisers say a strong showing in Iowa \u2014 especially if he finishes ahead of Ms. Warren \u2014 would be enough to catapult him through New Hampshire and into Nevada and Super Tuesday. \u201cIowa has to be a top priority for the campaign \u2014 we need to do very well in the state,\u201d said Representative Ro Khanna, one of Mr. Sanders\u2019s national campaign co-chairs. \u201cI hope he can go there every week,\u201d Mr. Khanna said. \u201cHe needs to be in Iowa as much as possible.\u201d To that end, his campaign has recently reallocated resources to the state, including spending $1.3 million to air its first television ad this month. It has built out its Iowa team, naming a key communications aide as its deputy state director. The campaign has also expanded its ground operation, with 13 field offices and more than 110 paid staffers. Mr. Sanders returned Thursday for a two-day, five-event swing, and plans to be back next week to lead a \u201cmarch to end corporate greed.\u201d According to aides, his campaign is also discussing a trip to the state with Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who recently endorsed him. Mr. Sanders, however, has competition: Nearly all of the top-tier candidates have also signaled that Iowa is a top priority. Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign has publicly sought to lower expectations but he has been to the state three times this month and is planning another four-day swing there next week. Ms. Warren, whose campaign was among the first to establish a presence in the state, has 19 field offices. Mr. Buttigieg recently completed an Iowa bus tour. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota has made 21 trips to the state, including her own post-debate bus tour, and has visited 55 of the state\u2019s 99 counties. Senator Kamala Harris vowed to visit the state every week in October. The sudden flurry of attention represents a change from earlier this year, when White House hopefuls appeared to be embracing a more national campaign strategy that took them beyond Iowa and other early nominating states. The growth of social media, the changes to the electoral calendar and the increasing diversity of the Democratic electorate combined to make it seem like Iowa, a predominantly white state, might lose its sway in the primary process. \u201cUsually there\u2019s a ramp-up period in past presidential cycles,\u201d said Sean Bagniewski, the Democratic chair in Polk County, about the focus on Iowa. \u201cThis year, it was like a thunderclap.\u201d The stakes in Iowa for Mr. Sanders have personal and psychological dimensions. After his surprising performance in the caucuses in 2016, some aides said the state has taken on an almost mystical quality. A weak result could also indicate that he does not have the same influence with progressive voters as he used to. Despite a series of disappointing polls in the state \u2014 a Suffolk University/USA Today poll released this week showed him in fourth place \u2014 allies are confident he is still in a position to do well. Like it did in 2016, the Sanders campaign is betting on an extensive ground game that relies heavily on a vast network of volunteers that they hope will motivate other supporters to turn out on caucus night \u2014 including people who do not typically participate in the political process. His aides believe that the technique, known as distributed organizing, will help motivate unlikely or first-time caucusgoers, especially those who were too young to participate in the last presidential caucuses; Latino voters, whose turnout rate in the caucuses is typically low; and working-class voters. The campaign sees high potential for victory particularly in and around college towns, like Ames and Iowa City, and in rural areas. To solidify his base of support, he has spent hours rallying on college campuses in an effort to capture the support of young voters. He has courted labor support particularly in counties along the Mississippi River. And he has held multiple \u201cUnidos con Bernie\u201d events with Latino voters. With $33.7 million cash on hand at the beginning of October, he will likely have plenty of money to spend in the state going forward on staffing and advertising. (On Friday, his campaign plans to go on air with an upbeat new television ad, about climate and green jobs in Iowa.) Aides are sensitive to any comparison of the Sanders campaign of 2020 to the Sanders campaign of 2016: Unlike then, when voters only had to choose between him and Mrs. Clinton, they now have a wealth of options. To win in Iowa this cycle, he need only secure a larger percentage of the vote than his opponents. But he has struggled to expand his support in the state, and there are some signs it may be diminishing: According to a poll last month from The Des Moines Register and CNN, only 25 percent of those who say they caucused for Mr. Sanders in 2016 said they would do so again, while 32 percent said they would support Ms. Warren and 12 percent said they would support Mr. Buttigieg. In recent months, Mr. Sanders has begun holding smaller town hall-style events that give audience members the opportunity to share their own deeply personal stories. Advisers hope the events will inspire voters to work together to change what Mr. Sanders views as a broken system. (The campaign recently cut a television ad from one of these town halls in Iowa that featured a woman telling a horrific story about medical debt.) Mr. Sanders is staking his success on supporters like Morgan Baethke, 58, of Indianola, Iowa, who was one of about 100 people who came to hear him speak in Marshalltown, the first stop on a two-day \u201cend corporate greed\u201d tour. Mr. Baethke, who works in retail, said he tries to convince other voters to caucus for Mr. Sanders by knocking on doors and participating in parades and festivals. But he also revealed a fundamental tension endemic to the Sanders campaign\u2019s organizing strategy: He said that he prefers to speak to voters in a neighboring county rather than his own. \u201cI don\u2019t feel comfortable in my home county looking at customers who I deal with during the day, going to their house in the evening, knocking on their door and saying, \u2018Would you support Bernie Sanders?,\u2019\u201d he said.",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump and his allies have struggled for months to come up with effective ways to confront Senator Elizabeth Warren, whose steady rise in the polls put the lie to Mr. Trump\u2019s boasts last spring that she was \u201cfinished\u201d and \u201cgone,\u201d undone by her past claims of Native American ancestry. Republicans have tried to brand her as a socialist, attack her policy ideas and portray her as too left-wing for the American electorate. None of those arguments have diminished her political momentum, robust fund-raising or polling. But in the past week, conservative news sites have challenged Ms. Warren\u2019s story about how a public school principal forced her out of a teaching job in 1971 because she was \u201cvisibly pregnant,\u201d and the Republican National Committee grabbed onto the issue to wage its own attack. In doing so, Republicans employed a tactic \u2014 questioning a female candidate\u2019s authenticity \u2014 that is at once often a sexist trope in politics and a strategy used against Hillary Clinton in 2016. Ms. Warren and her team, in turn, have confidently parried those attacks and used them to rally supporters. Rather than take a defensive posture, Ms. Warren has responded by offering her personal story as one of countless instances of pregnancy discrimination that have occurred in American workplaces, where it remains a widespread problem. In a video that has been viewed more than a million times across social media platforms, Ms. Warren read messages from women sharing their own experiences. Christina Reynolds, who was an aide on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign and is now a spokeswoman for EMILY\u2019s List, which supports female Democratic candidates who back abortion rights, said the Warren campaign\u2019s move to solicit stories from people was a better response to the line of attack \u201cthan just saying, \u2018No, it\u2019s not true.\u2019\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s a really powerful thing that she\u2019s done,\u201d she said, \u201cwhich is turn this into a learning opportunity for all of us as to what women have faced at past times, what they might still face and how can we do better.\u201d Well before Ms. Warren\u2019s story about losing her teaching job became the subject of news articles, she was being challenged over how she has presented her biography. Since she first ran for the Senate in 2012, she has faced questions over having identified herself as Native American during her career as a law professor, and she drew a backlash last year when she released a DNA test offering evidence that she had a Native American ancestor. Ms. Warren later apologized in private and in public. An email from the Republican National Committee on Tuesday offered a clear preview of how the party would seek to undermine her if she becomes the Democratic nominee: \u201cIt\u2019s not just her heritage Fauxcahontas has been lying about to get ahead,\u201d the subject line said. A spokeswoman for the committee, Liz Harrington, said on Wednesday, \u201cLike her false claim of Native American status, this is another example of Warren seemingly shifting the facts of her life story for personal gain.\u201d (Ms. Warren has said she did not advance her career by identifying herself as Native American, an assertion backed up by an extensive Boston Globe investigation.) \u201cThe more examples like this that surface, the more it will stick with voters that this is someone who cannot be trusted,\u201d Ms. Harrington said. Mr. Trump has slurred Ms. Warren for years over her ancestry claims, and the personal attacks on her come out of the Trump playbook from 2016 that targeted both Republicans and Mrs. Clinton. Michael Steel, a Republican strategist who was an adviser for former Gov. Jeb Bush\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, said Mr. Trump would need to \u201ctear down\u201d whoever is the eventual Democratic nominee in order to win re-election, given his low approval ratings. \u201cOne of Senator Warren\u2019s great strengths is her ability to connect her biography to her record to her plans for the future,\u201d he said. \u201cThat gets undermined if she can\u2019t rely on her biography as the foundation of that progression.\u201d All year, Ms. Warren has framed her personal story to voters as one of perseverance, focusing on her upbringing in Oklahoma, her family\u2019s financial struggles and her winding path to an eventual career as a law professor. Voters often praise her biographical story as a powerful part of her pitch, which centers on bringing about big change to an economic and political system that she describes as rigged against ordinary people. As part of that story, Ms. Warren tells crowds that at the end of her first year as a public-school teacher, she was \u201cvisibly pregnant\u201d and lost her job.  A retired teacher from Ms. Warren\u2019s school in New Jersey told CBS News, \u201cThe rule was at five months you had to leave when you were pregnant.\u201d Teachers in the United States were commonly pushed out of their jobs during pregnancy at the time, either through termination or the requirement of an unpaid leave of absence. Congress passed the Pregnancy Discrimination Act in 1978, which barred employers from treating pregnant women differently from other people \u201csimilar in their ability or inability to work,\u201d but claims of discrimination persist to this day. \u201cThese attacks on Senator Warren are absurd,\u201d said Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, who dropped out of the presidential race in August. \u201cOf course pregnancy discrimination was a serious problem in 1971, and it continues to be a widespread issue today despite a law banning it. The stories that women are sharing are real and powerful.\u201d Regardless, the Republican National Committee dismissed Ms. Warren\u2019s description of losing her job, citing a 2007 interview in which she discussed her public-school teaching career but did not mention being forced out, as well as records showing that the school board had approved a contract for Ms. Warren for the next school year. The records were reported on Monday by The Washington Free Beacon, a conservative website. \u201cAnother Elizabeth Warren lie about Elizabeth Warren?\u201d asked Kellyanne Conway, a top aide to Mr. Trump, as she shared The Free Beacon\u2019s article on Twitter. Ms. Warren told CBS News that she had not revealed her pregnancy when the contract was approved, and that two months later, when she was showing, the principal told her that she would not be welcomed back. Addressing the 2007 interview, she said: \u201cAfter becoming a public figure I opened up more about different pieces in my life and this was one of them.\u201d The attacks are the latest evidence of how Republicans are reviving tactics Mr. Trump used to caricature Mrs. Clinton, whom he branded as \u201cCrooked Hillary,\u201d as dishonest. Attacking authenticity has been a common strategy targeting women running for office for decades: Long before Mrs. Clinton, Geraldine Ferraro faced it in 1984, when she was the first woman to appear on a major party\u2019s presidential ticket. \u201cThis is a tried and true tactic when it comes to women candidates and elected officials, because women pay a much higher price when their honesty and integrity is called into question,\u201d said Amanda Hunter, research and communications director at the Barbara Lee Family Foundation, which supports women in politics. \u201cOur research shows that voters historically give women what we call a virtue advantage, but then the other side of that is they punish them for any real or manufactured ethical infraction,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd once women are knocked off that pedestal, it\u2019s a lot more difficult for them to climb all the way back up.\u201d Debbie Walsh, the director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University, said the broadsides against Ms. Warren reflected her increasing status as a front-runner for the Democratic nomination. \u201cThey\u2019re going to come for her in every possible way that they can, and her honesty and truthfulness will be one tactic,\u201d she said. \u201cWe certainly saw this as a tactic when Hillary Clinton was running, to constantly question her veracity.\u201d Ms. Walsh said she thought Ms. Warren\u2019s story of experiencing pregnancy discrimination would \u201cmake her relatable for an awful lot of women out there who understand that this has been how the world works.\u201d Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign demonstrated readiness for the attacks as news outlets began publishing articles in recent days about her public-school teaching career and pregnancy. Ms. Warren spoke with CBS News to go into greater detail about her story, and she and her campaign sought to shift the focus onto the broader issue of pregnancy discrimination. Her admirers praised her on social media and others offered support, including some rivals in the 2020 race, a sign of the protectiveness that many Democrats feel toward their candidates in the face of Republican attacks. Jennifer Palmieri, who was the communications director for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign, noted the extent of that unity around Ms. Warren. \u201cThis could have been something that really got pounced on by her opponents,\u201d she said, \u201cand that didn\u2019t happen.\u201d",

The Top Tier Is All White.Trailing in the money race, tripped up by their own missteps and perceived by some as less electable, nonwhite candidates find themselves well back of the leaders.By Astead W. Herndon and Jonathan MartinPRINT EDITIONDemocrats Have Diverse Field, But the Top Tier Is All White|October 30, 2019, Page A1",
      "author": "Astead W. Herndon",
      "content": "  When the Democratic primary contest began last winter, it featured the most racially diverse field in history, with two black senators, a Latino former cabinet secretary, an Asian-American businessman and the first American Samoan elected to Congress. But 10 months later, the Democratic field has a top tier of four white candidates, three of them men. Candidates of color are languishing in the low single digits in polls, well behind the four leaders \u2014 former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. The divide could become even more pronounced in the coming months: Because of new, more rigorous thresholds for the Democratic debate in December, it is possible that only one nonwhite candidate, Senator Kamala Harris of California, will qualify. With the Iowa caucuses three months away, it\u2019s a noticeable sorting of the field for an increasingly multiracial party, whose most recent White House victories were powered by a strong minority turnout for a black nominee. It has frustrated the Democrats seeking a more diverse party leadership \u2014 not to mention the affected candidates. \u201cI\u2019ve had lots of crazy things said to me, like, \u2018Is America ready for another black president?\u2019\u201d Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey said in an interview. \u201cAnd I\u2019m confident it\u2019s never been asked of a white candidate, \u2018Is America ready for another white president?\u2019\u201d The emergence of an all-white top tier reflects a combination of factors at the intersection of race, money and politics. Financial support from mostly white, educated elites has helped propel the candidacies of Ms. Warren and Mr. Buttigieg, while two nonwhite candidates \u2014 Mr. Booker and Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former housing secretary \u2014 have had to explicitly petition supporters for money to stay in the race. Assumptions about which candidates can or can\u2019t beat President Trump have also hurt minority candidates, with some Democrats fearing that the white working class voters who helped propel Mr. Trump to the White House would not support a nonwhite nominee.  Donors for Mr. Booker and Ms. Harris have argued that such implicit bias causes voters and pundits to treat Mr. Buttigieg as the natural heir to Mr. Biden\u2019s moderate coalition, though their candidates perform better among older black voters, the Democrats\u2019 most loyal moderate voting block. Other Democrats, however, say the blame rests with the candidates themselves. None of the nonwhite challengers have been able to forge a strong coalition or peel away black voters from Mr. Biden. Some voters and elected officials, white and nonwhite alike, now say privately what the polling suggests: They have not been swept off their feet by any of the candidates of color. Theodore Johnson, who studies African-American politics at the Brennan Center for Justice, said the nonwhite contenders, fairly or not, are suffering in comparison to the country\u2019s first black president. \u201cTheir road is easier because of Obama, but their ability to secure the nomination is harder because they\u2019re not Obama,\u201d said Mr. Johnson. Miscalculations along the way have not helped. Ms. Harris has been criticized for waffling on policy, Mr. Booker for timidness and Mr. Castro for a failed debate attack on Mr. Biden in September, which cost him the endorsement of one of his few Congressional allies. Mr. Castro, in an interview, zeroed in on \u201celectability\u201d as a problem, saying that concept has created an unspoken skepticism of nonwhite candidates among Democratic voters. People with this viewpoint, he said, can sometimes see nonwhite candidates as vice-presidential options, but not best equipped to lead the party. \u201cIn every election there\u2019s a current, and the current this year seems to be running toward candidates that people believe can take Donald Trump on with a certain profile of voter \u2014 the white working class in the Midwest,\u201d said Mr. Castro, whose polling support is running at about 1 percent. And, he added, \u201cassumptions are being made on who the best type of candidates are to do that.\u201d Mr. Booker said he thinks the tide will turn as more people seek a strong candidate to replace Mr. Biden as the moderate alternative to Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders. The trouble: getting enough financial support over the next two months to remain viable. \u201cI have to say these last few weeks, a lot of \u2014 a lot more people seem to be coming around,\u201d Mr. Booker said, \u201cand I think some of this might be because they\u2019re seeing some weakness to Biden.\u201d Aimee Allison, founder of She the People, the network of women of color looking to mobilize for the 2020 general election, said it was too early to rule out unforeseen shifts in the race\u2019s current pecking order. But she added that it would take more than an argument for racial representation to win over voters of color and rise in the polls. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had choices like this before, and that makes essentialism less important,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s diversity of opinion. Women of color are sophisticated voters and organizers. We understand that our power and influence can be felt through a candidate of any race and gender with our agenda.\u201d Any assessment of the performance of nonwhite candidates is complicated by Mr. Biden\u2019s enduring appeal with black voters. The former vice president remains popular from his time in the White House serving with President Barack Obama, and he benefits from the perception among many Democrats that he has the best chance to win back white voters who flipped to Mr. Trump. That popularity with African-Americans has helped keep Mr. Biden at or near the lead in the race for months, while preventing candidates like Mr. Booker and Ms. Harris from making inroads in states like South Carolina. One recent poll gave Mr. Biden a 17-point lead over his closest rivals in the state, propelled by the support of about 40 percent of black voters. Even left wing activists who prefer other candidates acknowledge Mr. Biden\u2019s advantage will be difficult to overcome. \u201cLike many black homes in America, my parents\u2019 home has an Obama shrine,\u201d said Tamika Gadsden, a South Carolina-based activist who likes Ms. Warren and Mr. Castro but whose parents side solidly with Mr. Biden. If Mr. Biden falters in predominantly white states that vote earlier, there\u2019s no guarantee that black voters will desert him \u2014 or that their support would automatically go to the race\u2019s black candidates. And the white candidates positioning themselves as moderate alternatives to Mr. Biden, like Mr. Buttigieg and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, have posted dismal numbers with nonwhite voters. Likewise, the candidates vying for the progressive lane, Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders, still face heavy skepticism among the older black voters. \u201cIt\u2019s still early,\u201d said Representative Karen Bass of California, the head of the Congressional Black Caucus, \u201cI don\u2019t take the top four as the fait accompli.\u201d Ms. Warren, of course, would be barrier-breaking in her own right as the first woman to be president, as would Mr. Buttigieg, an openly gay man. Both have risen to the top tier of early-state and national polls, and both are flush with cash from a largely white donor network that has assured them of long term viability. Together, Mr. Sanders, Ms. Warren, Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg have $90 million in cash on hand. Ms. Harris, Mr. Booker, Mr. Castro, Andrew Yang, the Asian-American entrepreneur, and Tulsi Gabbard, the American-Samoan Congresswoman, have about $24 million combined. Mr. Booker and Mr. Castro have, in recent weeks, had to make desperate hat-in-hand pleas for money just to stay in the race, and both received online boosts from prominent black and Latino politicians including Stacey Abrams of Georgia and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, who alluded to the importance of racial representation.  The race could quickly change before voting begins in February. Ms. Harris has more money in the bank, and more endorsements from the Congressional Black Caucus, than Mr. Biden. Mr. Castro has not qualified for the November debate, but Mr. Booker and Ms. Harris have \u2014 and will have more opportunities to catch fire ahead of the Iowa caucuses, which will reshape all expectations in a single night. Conversely, while none of the leading white candidates have proved they can forge a multiracial coalition, they still have time to make inroads. Ms. Warren has gained good will from black and Latino progressives for infusing her policy proposals with planks about racial equity. Mr. Sanders has a vast and diverse donor base, and recently won endorsements from three of the country\u2019s most prominent minority lawmakers, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and Representatives Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan. Ms. Harris, Mr. Castro, and Mr. Booker are inhibited in part because they came up through the Democratic establishment, and have faced criticism for legislative records that are viewed as out of step with the ascendant progressive wing. Mr. Castro, in response, has tried to remake himself as a progressive champion, and even disavowed some of the deportation actions of Mr. Obama\u2019s administration, in which he served. Ms. Harris and Mr. Booker have tried to toe a more careful line, in hopes they can win more moderate black voters should Mr. Biden falter. Mr. Booker has been attacked for his closeness to big donors and mixed police reform record as mayor of Newark. Ms. Harris\u2019s lack of clarity on policy has drawn fire, both from left-wing activists upset with her record as a prosecutor and centrists annoyed that she backed left-wing ideas such as the Green New Deal. Because of this, some black and Latino Democrats push back on the idea that it\u2019s racism or assumptions about electability that have hindered Ms. Booker, Ms. Harris and Mr. Castro. Privately they claim that some nonwhite Democrats who decided not to run, such as Ms. Abrams of Georgia or Andrew Gillum of Florida, would have been stronger candidates. \u201cIt boils down to the candidates themselves,\u201d said Representative Filemon Vela of Texas. \u201cThose structural barriers existed when President Obama ran.\u201d Mr. Vela, for his part, is backing Mr. Biden, convinced that he\u2019s best suited to defeat Mr. Trump. But he thinks a woman of color should be on the ticket and he has one in mind: Senator Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada.",

      "author": "Jonathan Martin",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Senator Elizabeth Warren has built her following in part by taking pictures with thousands of voters deep into evening after campaign events, but her dinner audience here one night last month was far smaller. And Ms. Warren\u2019s guests were more interested in hearing, and politely challenging, her campaign pitch than eagerly capturing the moment for posterity on their iPhones. Addressing a few dozen members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus at a Chinese restaurant a few blocks from the Capitol, she laid out her case for why she could unify Democrats, emphasized that she was not hostile to properly run businesses and made a soft sell to the lawmakers to support her presidential bid. \u201cShe said, \u2018Nobody could do this alone, I will need your help,\u2019\u201d recalled Representative Chellie Pingree of Maine, who attended the gathering and said Ms. Warren \u201cwas great.\u201d But just under a month since the family-style meal, the Massachusetts senator has the same small number of endorsements from congressional colleagues beyond her home state as she did beforehand: three. Ms. Warren is expected to reveal additional support from Democratic officials this week in conjunction with Tuesday\u2019s CNN/New York Times debate and the release of her smashing third-quarter financial disclosure. Yet her growing crowd sizes, soaring fund-raising and surge to the top of a number of national and early-state polls only shine a brighter light on one of the most revealing elements of this primary: the widening gap between the preferences of many Democratic voters and the lawmakers who represent them. Ms. Warren is now a clear front-runner in the race for her party\u2019s nomination, yet just under four months before the leadoff Iowa caucuses she lacks the support of a single governor, big-city mayor or fellow senator outside Massachusetts. She does have the backing of the Working Families Party, an influential liberal group, and yet she also has fewer total endorsements from state legislators in Iowa and New Hampshire than Senator Cory Booker, who registers in the lower single-digits of surveys and last month had to beseech donors to give him enough money to sustain his stagnant campaign. The apparent lag between Democratic activists and Democratic elected officials, which comes nearly four years after President Trump\u2019s stunning outsider\u2019s capture of the Republican nomination and Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019 surprisingly potent candidacy in the Democratic primaries, has done little to slow Ms. Warren\u2019s momentum. Yet the reluctance of Democratic lawmakers to embrace Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign this deep into the year, after she has plainly emerged as a leading candidate, illustrates both the lingering reservations party elites have about her general election prospects and her unique positioning in this race. \u201cRacing to the left is not really speaking to the needs of people in the heartland,\u201d said Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, who expressed alarm about scrapping private health insurance, urged the candidates to focus on \u201cpocketbook issues\u201d and, when asked if Ms. Warren could reclaim the Midwestern states Mr. Trump captured in 2016, paused before saying: \u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d Ms. Warren is politically neither fish nor fowl. She is not an anti-establishment insurgent in the style of Mr. Sanders, who were he in the position Ms. Warren is now would almost certainly have inspired a Stop Bernie campaign funded by a petrified donor class. But with her refusal to raise money among rich contributors, her unabashed populism and her pre-Senate roots in academia, she is hardly a Clinton-style creature of the Democratic political class. As a result, many party officials are neither rushing to oppose her nor racing to her side, instead staying on the sidelines and doing what politicians often do when they are uncertain of what choice to make: buying time. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to wait, you keep your relationships good,\u201d said Representative Deb Haaland of New Mexico, one of the few lawmakers who is supporting Ms. Warren, noting that some of her colleagues are loath to offend their friends in the race by choosing a candidate. Reinforcing this instinct toward caution is the fluid nature of a primary still large enough to feature 12 candidates on the debate stage this week as well as the high stakes of next year\u2019s general election. \u201cYou had two candidates last time,\u201d said longtime Representative Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, referring to the Sanders-versus-Hillary Clinton race. \u201cPeople want to see this unfold.\u201d Thanks to his decades-long relationships and the perception in some quarters that he would be a strong candidate against Mr. Trump, Joseph R. Biden Jr. has picked up the most support from Democratic lawmakers of any of the presidential hopefuls. But his uneven performance as a candidate this year and Mr. Trump\u2019s daily barrage of attacks on him have left some party officials wondering just how safe a pick he is in 2020. \u201cPeople are concerned about Joe, but they ask: Is Elizabeth electable?\u201d said former Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, explaining the dilemma. \u201cSo a lot of people are just keeping their powder dry because they have not decided who can best run against Trump.\u201d Defeating a president who may be the first incumbent to seek re-election after being impeached should be the party\u2019s overriding focus, said Gov. J.B. Pritzker of Illinois. \u201cI genuinely feel our republic is in danger,\u201d Mr. Pritzker said. A longtime donor who often immersed himself in primaries before he entered politics, Mr. Pritzker said he was staying out of this race for the time being in part because he was still stung by 2016, when some of Mr. Sanders\u2019s supporters protested what they saw as his mistreatment by Mrs. Clinton and her establishment-aligned supporters. \u201cWhen he didn\u2019t win people folded their arms and stayed home or they voted for Jill Stein or Gary Johnson,\u201d said Mr. Pritzker, alluding to two of the third-party candidates whose votes helped cost Mrs. Clinton the election. He\u2019s not the only Democrat who has the echo of the Sanders-Clinton race still throbbing in their ears nor the only one determined to avoid alienating any of the supporters of this cycle\u2019s candidates. \u201cMany believed the primary was rigged in favor of Hillary Clinton,\u201d Representative Darren Soto of Florida said. \u201cThere is a feeling among many of us that we need to have a broad and diverse field, plenty of debates and let the primary voters decide on their own.\u201d What few lawmakers will say, at least publicly, is that wading into the race can also come with a cost: they run the risk of angering the eventual nominee if they support a losing candidate and they also invite complaints from their own constituents or donors, who may have a different preference. What\u2019s more, they also have to be mindful of their own political branding and how they align themselves.  \u201cPoliticians are different from voters,\u201d said Donna Brazile, the longtime Democratic strategist and former party chair. \u201cThey have to say, \u2018How does this fit with my agenda, my district?\u2019\u201d In Ms. Warren\u2019s case, even one of her biggest boosters, Ms. Haaland, conceded it was easier for her to step out early because of the progressive nature of her district. \u201cSome folks they\u2019re just like, \u2018I better stay out of it for a while because of my district,\u2019\u201d she said of her House colleagues. And it\u2019s not just lawmakers who are taking a wait-and-see approach. Powerful liberal interest groups, including much of organized labor, are also hanging back, which only prompts the politicians to believe it\u2019s safer to remain mum. \u201cThat would make a difference if they came out,\u201d Representative Dina Titus of Nevada said of unions. \u201cThey\u2019re all being coy, too.\u201d Ms. Titus said she planned to get behind a candidate later this year, but her state, the third to vote in next year\u2019s primary, illustrates just how many party elites were remaining neutral: Nevada\u2019s governor, two senators, three Democratic House members and longtime boss, former Senator Harry Reid, have all refrained from endorsing a candidate. Representative Jamie Raskin of Maryland said that he had also been \u201cdrawn in different directions in this race,\u201d noting that he wanted to make a decision that\u2019s both \u201cpassionate and strategic.\u201d But after having lunch in Washington last month with Ms. Warren and her husband, Bruce Mann, Mr. Raskin said he planned on endorsing the senator. \u201cIf all she had to her name was senator from Massachusetts she would not be an ideal candidate,\u201d he said, before citing Ms. Warren\u2019s record as a consumer advocate and critic of Washington self-dealing. \u201cAs a candidate of public integrity and honesty in government, she has a very powerful story to tell at a time of boundless Republican corruption and lawlessness.\u201d What\u2019s more, Mr. Raskin said, \u201cShe made a very eloquent and personal pitch to me.\u201d As for Ms. Pingree, she said she was \u201cwatching the wisdom, the perspective of the public\u201d and was eager \u201cto see who people get excited about.\u201d She will also have a chance to gauge the views of her colleagues. When Congress comes back from its recess this week, Ms. Pingree said she and the other House Democrats who live in her Washington high rise planned on having a debate watch party in the building\u2019s common room.",

I\u2019m filling in for Nick Corasaniti this week for our Tuesday newsletter, which covers all things media and messaging. Sign up here to get On Politics in your inbox. In the third quarter of Iowa State\u2019s football game against Oklahoma State on Saturday, television viewers came across an unfamiliar sight: a commercial for Elizabeth Warren. Until that moment, Ms. Warren\u2019s presidential campaign had been conspicuously absent from the airwaves in the Democratic primary race \u2014 even as rivals with far less money to spend have bought television ads. The ad that appeared on Saturday was the first time the Warren campaign has aired a commercial in the 2020 race, her campaign confirmed. In the minute-long ad, Ms. Warren, a senator from Massachusetts, begins by telling the story of her upbringing in Oklahoma, illustrated with old photos and home movies. Then she talks about a central theme of her campaign: the idea that the government \u201cworks for the rich and the powerful, and leaves everyone else behind,\u201d which Ms. Warren says amounts to corruption. The ad concludes with footage from the big rally Ms. Warren held in Washington Square Park in New York in September. The ad, which aired on the cable sports network FS1, cost $27,000, according to Advertising Analytics, a media-tracking company. That is a drop in the bucket for the Warren campaign, which entered October with $25.7 million in cash on hand, more than any Democratic campaign aside from that of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. It is also a tiny amount compared with what the Warren campaign has spent on digital advertising: more than $6 million in total on Facebook and Google, according to data from those companies. Ms. Warren speaks somewhat contemptuously about television ads, preferring instead to talk about her desire to build a \u201cgrass-roots movement\u201d that would pay off in November 2020. \u201cWe can\u2019t have a model of, scoop up a bunch of money, run a bunch of TV ads at the last minute and then count on all of the folks to show up,\u201d she said earlier this year. Still, Ms. Warren is planning to spend millions on television advertising as time goes on. In September, her team announced what it described as an eight-figure advertising campaign in the first four states to vote \u2014 Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina \u2014 that would include digital and television ads. Her campaign is set to air commercials in Iowa next week, according to Advertising Analytics, and it has reserved millions of dollars of television ads in those four states in early 2020. The Warren campaign decided to produce its television ads in-house \u201crather than adopt the consultant-driven approach of other campaigns (and the big commissions and fees that come along with it),\u201d her campaign manager, Roger Lau, wrote in a memo in September announcing the eight-figure ad campaign. Her team unveiled three ads at the time, including the 60-second spot that was shown on Saturday. Ms. Warren visited Iowa State\u2019s campus in Ames for a town hall event last week and will return to Iowa on Friday for a four-day visit. She is hoping she fares better in the caucuses than the school\u2019s football team fared on Saturday: They entered the game as the favorite but ended up losing to Oklahoma State, 34-27.

President Trump\u2019s re-election campaign has moved quickly to highlight the death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State, in its advertising. On Sunday morning, Mr. Trump announced that Mr. al-Baghdadi had died in a raid in Syria. On Monday, his campaign began running Facebook ads about Mr. al-Baghdadi\u2019s death, according to the company\u2019s database of political ads. Some of the ads said, \u201cPresident Trump has brought the #1 terrorist leader to justice. He is KEEPING AMERICA SAFE.\u201d Others cited \u201cthe fierce leadership of our Commander-in-Chief.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s re-election effort has poured money into Facebook advertising. Some of its ads about Mr. al-Baghdadi\u2019s death sought to collect campaign donations. Others were intended to grow its list of possible supporters. They asked people to fill out an \u201cOfficial Job Performance Poll\u201d that included one question: \u201cHow would you rate President Trump\u2019s recent job performance?\u201d Crucially, the so-called poll asked people to provide their name, email address, ZIP code and cellphone number \u2014 allowing the Trump campaign to reach out to them in the future to solicit campaign donations. Our colleague Stephanie Saul just published a big story about Elizabeth Warren\u2019s legal work defending corporations in bankruptcy cases while she was a law professor. Here\u2019s the story behind the story, from Stephanie: Like most reporters, I\u2019ve spent a considerable amount of time in courthouses, covering big criminal cases and multimillion-dollar civil disputes. Over the years, I\u2019ve become familiar with the lingo lawyers and judges use, and I thought I had a fair understanding of how the legal system worked. In all my trips to courthouses, though, I had never drilled into the arcana of bankruptcy. Until this year. Enter Elizabeth Warren, a onetime bankruptcy professor turned senator and presidential candidate. In May, Ms. Warren released a list of legal cases she had handled on the side while working as a professor. As part of our jobs as political reporters, we look deeply into the backgrounds of candidates. Many of these stories run under our series called \u201cThe Long Run.\u201d The job of looking into Ms. Warren\u2019s legal work fell to me, a nonlawyer. The cases presented an apparent contradiction. Ms. Warren is a progressive who frequently criticizes the behavior of corporations, but had advised big companies like LTV Steel and Dow Chemical. She is a proponent of the Green New Deal, but had represented utilities that generated power using fossil fuels, and had gone to bat for a company that did not want to pay for cleaning up a Superfund site it left behind. Was Ms. Warren a hypocrite, as some of her opponents had suggested, or was something else in play? My reporting for this story, which involved reading Ms. Warren\u2019s cases and contacting other lawyers involved, revealed that the answer lay in Ms. Warren\u2019s devotion to the bankruptcy system. Even as she fought on behalf of corporate clients, experts told me, she was also working to preserve the bankruptcy process itself. Here\u2019s my article on Ms. Warren\u2019s bankruptcy work for big corporations. Were you forwarded this newsletter? Subscribe here to get it delivered to your inbox. Thanks for reading.

What we don\u2019t know: A lot, still.By Giovanni RussonelloPRINT EDITIONPoll Puts Four in a Tie, With Many Iowa Voters Still Open to Persuasion|November 3, 2019, Page A19",
      "author": "Giovanni Russonello",
      "content": " Senator Elizabeth Warren is starting to stand out in Iowa, as Friday\u2019s New York Times/Siena College poll shows. But she isn\u2019t standing alone \u2014\u00a0at least not yet. With the candidacy of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. cooling off, the race now looks more interesting than at any point since campaigning in Iowa began intensifying over the summer. Here are a few major takeaways from the poll. The Iowa poll demonstrated that Ms. Warren has strength in Iowa, and room to grow \u2014\u00a0but she has not quite broken out of the pack. All four of the top candidates \u2014 Ms. Warren, Mr. Biden, Senator Bernie Sanders and Mayor Pete Buttigieg \u2014\u00a0are technically locked in a statistical tie, according to the poll\u2019s 4.7-point margin of error. Then there\u2019s the fact that 65 percent of Iowa voters who named a first-choice candidate said they could still be persuaded to caucus for someone else. While Ms. Warren is at the top of the crowded bunch with 23 percent of the overall vote, only about a quarter of her supporters are certain they\u2019ll caucus for her\u00a0on Feb. 3. That said, there is evidence to suggest that her support is solidifying. Ms. Warren is the second-choice pick of 25 percent of voters with a chosen candidate \u2014 that\u2019s 10 points higher than Mr. Sanders, the runner-up. And she leads among the two-thirds of voters who say they\u2019re paying very close attention to the news; she has 23 percent support from that group, compared to Mr. Sanders\u2019 16 percent. As the caucuses near and attention picks up, she may have a particularly good shot at winning over voters who are just tuning in. With Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign faltering slightly, there are signs hidden within these poll results that he is still relying heavily on name recognition, rather than enthusiasm. He is buoyed by the sense \u2014\u00a0held by four in five Democratic voters \u2014\u00a0that he would have a good chance of beating President Trump in the general election. Slim majorities of Democratic voters say they would prefer a moderate candidate and one who promises to find common ground, rather than a trenchant liberal. But Mr. Buttigieg also polls formidably among these middle-path voters, and he is fast on Mr. Biden\u2019s heels. They are roughly tied for the lead among voters looking for a candidate who will\u00a0seek common ground with political opponents. Meanwhile, Mr. Biden doesn\u2019t command even 10 percent among the liberal Iowa voters that make up the party\u2019s core. Only 2 percent of voters underage 45 said they would support him. And he draws a good deal of his backing from those who say they have never attended a caucus before, possibly showing that his numbers are being pumped up by respondents who are less engaged\u00a0\u2014 and perhaps, less likely to turn out. Mr. Sanders, who nearly won the Iowa caucuses four years ago,\u00a0stands at 19 percent in the poll, revealing that he has held onto a durable \u2014 but diminished \u2014 following. Ms. Warren has already swept up support among what was once his most solid demographic: young voters. According to the poll, Ms. Warren was the choice of a whopping 38 percent of voters under 30, compared to 29 percent for Mr. Sanders. But neither of them has been able to capture even one out of every five voters age 45 and over. Ms. Warren seems to have annexed much of Mr. Sanders\u2019 support among very liberal caucusgoers; she now has 37 percent of them in her corner, compared to 28 percent for him. Not all of the Democratic voters who are gravitating toward Ms. Warren express passion for each element of her progressive agenda. Two-thirds strongly back the idea of a public health care option, and a majority \u2014\u00a057 percent \u2014\u00a0also strongly support increasing Social Security benefits. But there is less widespread enthusiasm for some of the boldest progressive proposals that Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders have put forth. Just one-third of Democratic voters expressed strong support for giving free college tuition to all Americans, and only 43 percent strongly believe the big banks and tech companies should be broken up. Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s and Mr. Biden\u2019s backers tend not to be enthusiastic about those ideas. Yet Ms. Warren has managed to assemble an ideologically diverse coalition. Though her supporters generally skew liberal, most of\u00a0them don\u2019t feel strongly about eliminating college tuition, and almost half don\u2019t express strong support for breaking up banks and tech companies. Health care has been the most discussed issue of the primary season, with Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren advocating a \u201cMedicare for all\u201d bill and more moderate candidates calling for a public option. The poll found that most Democratic voters in Iowa are open to a single payer-type plan, but a majority would prefer a candidate who seeks to strengthen the Affordable Care Act and add a public option. While Mr. Sanders\u2019 Iowa supporters are united in their desire for a single-payer health care system, Ms. Warren brings together a broader spectrum: Barely over half of her voters feel strongly about getting rid of private insurance. This suggests that Ms. Warren has room to grow among the substantial share of voters who are less interested in Medicare for all, and who have not yet settled on a final candidate choice. It is impossible to say just how many voters will actually turn out in a primary, or which groups will vote in the greatest numbers. At caucuses, which are more sparsely attended, it\u2019s especially hard to know. So, remember that like all the pre-election surveys that you\u2019ll see in the coming months, the results of this one were dictated in part by how our team defined the probable electorate. Add in the complex set of rules governing the Iowa caucuses \u2014 where backers of less-popular candidates will eventually have to throw their support to someone else on the night of the election \u2014 and it all adds up to a lot of uncertainty. This poll is nothing more than our attempt at a snapshot of where things are at, three months out. Besides that, Iowa\u2019s voters are more than 90 percent white, so the results of this poll carry only the faintest of implications about how the race will play out in the rest of the country. After Iowa\u2019s caucuses and the first primary a week later, in heavily white New Hampshire, the importance of the party\u2019s nonwhite electorate \u2014 particularly black and Hispanic voters \u2014 will come back into the foreground. From late February through Super Tuesday on March 3, the focus will be on major contests in Southern and Western states.",

      "content": " The top Democratic presidential candidates are locked in a close race in the 2020 Iowa caucuses, with Senator Elizabeth Warren slightly ahead of Senator Bernie Sanders, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., according to a New York Times/Siena College poll of likely Democratic caucusgoers. Ms. Warren appears to have solidified her gains in the first voting state while Mr. Buttigieg has climbed quickly to catch up with Mr. Sanders and overtake Mr. Biden, the onetime front-runner. Ms. Warren is drawing support from 22 percent of likely caucusgoers, while Mr. Sanders is at 19 percent, followed by Mr. Buttigieg at 18 percent and Mr. Biden at 17 percent. The survey is full of alarming signs for Mr. Biden, who entered the race in April at the top of the polls in Iowa and nationally. He is still in the lead in most national polls, but his comparatively weak position in the earliest primary and caucus states now presents a serious threat to his candidacy. With the Iowa caucuses just three months away, Mr. Biden\u2019s unsteadiness appears to have opened a path in the race for other Democrats closer to the political middle, particularly Mr. Buttigieg. The poll reveals a race in flux but not in disarray, framed by a stark debate about the direction of the Democratic Party and by a degree of fluidity arising from Mr. Biden\u2019s travails. In the early states, at least, the former vice president appears to be buckling on one side to the expansive populism of Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders, and on the other to Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s calls for generational change. While no single candidate has a decisive advantage, the strongest currents in the party appear to be swirling around candidates promising in different ways to challenge the existing political and economic order. Several of them would also represent change by virtue of their identities, including Ms. Warren, who would be the first female president, and Mr. Buttigieg, who is gay. But despite the historic diversity of the field, all the top candidates are white. In Iowa, a state that helped vault Barack Obama into the presidency, the poll found a substantial bloc concerned that anyone other than a heterosexual white man might struggle to defeat President Trump. The survey found Iowa Democrats in a divided and perhaps indecisive state about what the party must do in order to deny Mr. Trump a second term. They are an ideologically mixed group, with younger voters trending to the left and leaning strongly toward Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders. Mr. Biden remains the favorite candidate of older voters, but only 2 percent of respondents under 45 years old said they currently plan to caucus for him. The caucuses are Feb. 3. In the poll, large majorities were supportive of ambitious liberal policy goals, like breaking up big banks, increasing Social Security benefits and implementing single-payer health care. But perhaps out of political caution, the poll also found that more Democrats would prefer to nominate someone who supports improving the private health insurance system rather than replacing it altogether. And most Democrats said they would favor a nominee willing to work with Republicans. There is still plenty of room for shifts in political momentum: Two-thirds of likely caucusgoers in The Times poll said they could still be persuaded to change their minds. Outside the top tier of four candidates, the best-performing Democrat was Senator Amy Klobuchar, supported by 4 percent of respondents, followed by Senator Kamala Harris and Andrew Yang, both at 3 percent, and Senator Cory Booker, Representative Tulsi Gabbard and Tom Steyer, all at 2 percent. The Iowa caucuses are a fairly arcane institution that differs from a standard primary election. They traditionally require Democrats to gather at myriad locations around the state for a multiround process in which voters group themselves behind their first-choice candidate; if a candidate registers less than 15 percent support, their supporters can reallocate themselves to other candidates. Factoring in voters\u2019 second choices, Ms. Warren had the broadest appeal: She is the first or second preference of 47 percent of Iowa Democrats, with two-thirds of Sanders supporters naming her as their backup choice. Mr. Sanders is the first or second choice of 34 percent of likely caucusgoers, followed by Mr. Buttigieg at 31 percent. Mr. Biden was in fourth place by this measure, at 28 percent; only 1 in 10 voters named him as their second choice. The Times/Siena survey of 439 Iowa Democratic caucusgoers was conducted from Oct. 25-30 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.7 percentage points. Here are the full results and the methodology for the poll. One issue that occasions little division among Democrats is impeachment. Eighty-nine percent of people in the poll said they support impeaching Mr. Trump and removing him from office. Most Iowa Democrats in the poll said they were somewhat or very confident that the party\u2019s top candidates would beat Mr. Trump in the general election. There was no difference in how they assessed Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren on that measure, and Mr. Sanders and Mr. Buttigieg fared only slightly worse. The confidence Iowa Democrats expressed in Ms. Warren as a general-election candidate could represent something of a turning point for her candidacy, if she can extend the sentiment to other early states. For much of the race, even Democratic voters who have embraced her ideas and political persona have harbored reservations about her odds against Mr. Trump. In Iowa, that appears to have changed. Jonathan Morrison, 45, of Mason City, said he was drawn to Ms. Warren because of her grasp of economic issues and believed she would \u201chold her own\u201d against the president. \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s going to allow herself to be pushed around or bullied by Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s going to stick to the facts and call him out on his policies.\u201d Mr. Morrison, who said he is a drone pilot in the oil and gas industry, said he also liked Mr. Buttigieg, whom he described as having a \u201cleadership aura about him.\u201d \u201cI think Pete Buttigieg is going to be president someday,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure it\u2019s this time around.\u201d Both Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders appear to be tapping into a thirst among many primary voters for transformational policies rather than incremental improvements in governance. But the presence of two forceful, well-funded populists in the race may be preventing either Mr. Sanders or Ms. Warren from gaining a wide advantage. They have assembled somewhat different political coalitions: Ms. Warren is the top choice of younger voters, women and people with college degrees, while Mr. Sanders fares better with men and people with high school degrees or less. He also retains significant backing from young people, and his supporters are the least likely to say they might change their minds before February. Though Mr. Buttigieg would be the youngest president ever, he is not exceptionally popular with his generational cohort. He fared somewhat better with older voters than younger ones; like Ms. Warren, he registered strongly among people with college and postgraduate degrees. Mr. Biden\u2019s support comes almost exclusively from older voters: Among people 65 years or older, he is still the front-runner, with backing from nearly a third of them. But he has negligible support among younger Iowans. With voters under 45, Mr. Biden is polling several points behind Mr. Yang, a former tech executive who has never run for office before. An ideological gulf, running along generational lines, is a major feature of the Democratic race. Two-thirds of voters under 30 favored either Ms. Warren or Mr. Sanders, while a smaller majority of people over 65 favored either Mr. Biden or Mr. Buttigieg. An overwhelming 85 percent of voters under 30 said they preferred a nominee promising fundamental change over one seeking to restore normalcy in Washington. Among voters more than 65 years old, 7 in 10 preferred a candidate who would bring back normalcy. William Nix of Waterloo, Iowa, is among the young voters torn between several candidates promising large-scale change. He said he had long admired Mr. Sanders but worried that he might pull out of the race after his recent heart attack. Mr. Nix, who is 21 and works on an assembly line at John Deere, said he was considering Ms. Warren and Mr. Buttigieg, and wanted a nominee focused on economic inequality and access to education. \u201cI\u2019m really all for making going to college more affordable,\u201d Mr. Nix said. \u201cThat is my biggest thing, because I want to go to college myself.\u201d Most Iowa Democrats appear to believe it is easier for candidates who are heterosexual, white, male and ideologically moderate to win presidential races, though that assessment is not playing a decisive role in shaping their caucus preferences. Most poll respondents said they believed it would be harder to win the election with a nominee who is more liberal than most Democrats, or one who is gay. About half expressed those reservations about a female nominee, and 4 in 10 were pessimistic about an African-American candidate These reservations about embracing the diversity of their presidential field have not translated into enthusiasm for Mr. Biden. One reason may be his age: A majority of respondents said they believed it would be harder to win the election with a candidate over the age of 75. Both Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders would turn 80 within a year or two of taking office. Julia Roberts, a voter in Winterset, Iowa, is among those wary of nominating someone whose identity could unsettle rural conservatives. Ms. Roberts, 60, a retired state employee, favored Mr. Biden because she saw him as the strongest general-election candidate and valued his foreign policy experience. \u201cI think, really, he\u2019s got the best chance of beating Trump,\u201d Ms. Roberts said, adding that she also liked Ms. Warren and Mr. Buttigieg but feared there would be \u201cprejudice in play\u201d against them.  Tonda Hadden, 63, of Council Bluffs, Iowa, said she had originally favored Mr. Biden or Mr. Sanders. But she worried Mr. Sanders was \u201ctoo old and too left.\u201d With Mr. Biden, she had grown \u201ca little worried about his gaffes.\u201d Ms. Hadden said she was now \u201cstill looking\u201d over her options: She named Ms. Warren as her current favorite and Mr. Buttigieg as an intriguing alternative. And she said she hoped some others, like Mr. Booker, whom she saw interviewed Wednesday on \u201cThe View,\u201d would get a closer look from voters. \u201cI really like him,\u201d she said of Mr. Booker, \u201cand I don\u2019t understand why he\u2019s not up in the polls.\u201d",

      "author": "Sydney Ember",
      "content": "  DES MOINES \u2014 Displaying a new assertiveness toward her Democratic opponents, Elizabeth Warren laced into her chief political rivals, warning on Friday night that the country was in a \u201ctime of crisis\u201d and arguing that Democrats would lose in 2020 if they nominated \u201canyone who comes on this stage and tells you they can make change without a fight.\u201d Speaking to thunderous applause during the party\u2019s biggest Iowa political event of the year, Ms. Warren denounced candidates in the presidential race who opposed bold ideas in favor of more moderate solutions, in veiled attacks on Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Pete Buttigieg. \u201cFear and complacency does not win elections,\u201d she said at the Iowa Democratic Party\u2019s fund-raising dinner. \u201cHope and courage wins elections. I\u2019m not running some consultant-driven campaign with some vague ideas that are designed not to offend anyone.\u201d Befitting her front-runner status, Ms. Warren was the target of heated attacks from three of the first five speakers on the stage: Mr. Biden, Mr. Buttigieg and Kamala Harris. None of the candidates mentioned one another by name, though Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg both presented themselves as more capable of uniting the country. \u201cWe will fight when we must fight but I will never allow us to get so wrapped up in the fighting that we start to think that fighting is the point,\u201d Mr. Buttigieg said. Mr. Biden, who spoke directly after Mr. Buttigieg, extended the theme, saying, \u201cIf you can\u2019t bring the country together we\u2019re in real, real, real trouble.\u201d Even Ms. Harris, whose campaign is lagging to the point that she may not qualify for the party\u2019s December debate, attacked Ms. Warren personally for the first time. \u201cI\u2019ve only had one client in my life \u2014 the people,\u201d Ms. Harris said of her career as a prosecutor. \u201cUnlike others, I\u2019ve never represented a corporation.\u201d The sharp exchanges underscored the urgency motivating the candidates as the race enters its final phase ahead of the Iowa caucuses three months from now. The dinner occurred on one of the most consequential days of the race so far, with Ms. Warren, under pressure from other candidates over how she would pay for \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d finally introducing a long-awaited, $20.5 trillion proposal that immediately drew a fierce attack from her chief rival, Mr. Biden. Mr. Biden declared that under his health care plan, there would be \u201cno increase in taxes for the middle class. None, none, none,\u201d a shot at Ms. Warren\u2019s delay in articulating whether such taxpayers would see tax increases. Instead, Mr. Biden promised an opportunity to \u201cbuy into a Medicare-like proposal.\u201d The Biden, Buttigieg and Warren campaigns each bought large sections of the 16,000-seat Wells Fargo Arena here for supporters to cheer on their candidates. Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s section was particularly enthusiastic, clapping thundersticks and waving flashing lights throughout his address. Ms. Warren\u2019s fans were also spirited, unfurling a banner during her speech with the words, \u201cWin with Warren.\u201d Bernie Sanders, while speaking at the event, brought no supporters, electing to lead them in a march outside instead, part of a pattern of the independent senator\u2019s antipathy toward Democratic Party functions. At the same time, the candidates have been wooing voters with bus tours, rallies and town hall-style events. Ms. Harris, the California senator who is trying to revive her campaign, has taken to cooking Sunday night dinners in supporters\u2019 homes and plans to spend Thanksgiving in the state. The surge in attention on Iowa coincides with a more contentious phase of the race, marked by aggressive campaigning and an increased willingness to go on the offensive. Mr. Sanders, the senator from Vermont, and Mr. Biden, the former vice president, have resumed their attacks on each other, with back-and-forth sniping in the last week about Medicare for all and super PACs. Mr. Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar have shown an increased willingness to go after Ms. Warren, the senator from Massachusetts. Hours before the dinner was to begin, Former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas announced the end of his presidential campaign. His departure was so sudden that supporters had already planted scores of his signature black-and-white campaign signs outside the arena. Lower-tier candidates looking to energize their campaigns have also been more pugnacious: Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, for instance, has amped up her criticisms of the Democratic National Committee, the news media and even Hillary Clinton, who is not in the race. But nowhere has the battle been more intense than at the event on Friday, with candidates trading barbs less on specific policies, and more on political ideology. \u201cWe need big ideas, and here\u2019s the critical part: We need to be willing to fight for them,\u201d Ms. Warren said. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to give up on a big idea, but when we give up on big ideas, we give up on the people whose lives would be touched by those ideas.\u201d Of the top-tier candidates, only Mr. Sanders \u2014 the sole candidate to stand stationary and speak from note on a lectern \u2014 did not attack his opponents, instead delivering a version of his standard stump speech that championed the working class and took aim at corporate interests and the rich. He quoted Franklin D. Roosevelt and Nelson Mandela and provided pleas for his signature policy proposals, including \u201cMedicare for all\u201d and tuition-free public college. He also announced his campaign was donating $20,000 to the Iowa Democratic Party in a symbolic show of solidarity even as he continues to eschew traditional party politicking. The crowded and diverse field \u2014 there are still 17 candidates \u2014 has proved challenging for contenders outside the top tier. While nine have qualified for the party\u2019s November debate in Atlanta, just four are guaranteed a spot for the December debate in Los Angeles. A poll taken this week of likely caucusgoers by The New York Times and Siena College shows the top four candidates locked in an extraordinarily tight race. Ms. Warren held a narrow advantage, with the support of 22 percent of voters, while Mr. Sanders drew 19 percent and Mr. Buttigieg 18 percent. Mr. Biden, who entered the race as a front-runner, had the backing of 17 percent of likely caucusgoers, much weaker than his position in national polls. For Democrats who had been inclined to support Mr. Biden but now find themselves shopping around, that means the moderate choices are limited to Mr. Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., and Ms. Klobuchar, the senator from Minnesota, with other would-be options like Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey falling out of the conversation. Susan Swift, a 58-year-old yoga teacher from Dubuque, said at a Biden event Wednesday that even after watching nine months of campaigning she was still trying to decipher the field. Ms. Swift said she liked the former vice president for \u201chis experience,\u201d but had become more impressed with Mr. Buttigieg the more she had seen him. \u201cDid you see the pluck that that guy had in the last debate?\u201d she said. \u201cSeriously? I was like, \u2018You just won my heart.\u2019\u201d Conversations this week with 24 of Iowa\u2019s 99 Democratic county leaders revealed moderate Democrats moving from Mr. Biden toward Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Klobuchar, who the county officials said had benefited from strong debate performances and repeated trips to the state. Mr. Sanders, who fought Mrs. Clinton to a draw in Iowa four years ago, has struggled to retain support in the party\u2019s most liberal pockets. Some of his anti-establishment backers have gravitated to candidates even more outside the mainstream, like the entrepreneur Andrew Yang and Ms. Gabbard. Zach Simonson, the Democratic chairman in Wapello County, backed Mr. Sanders in 2016 and said he was now torn between Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren. \u201cI was all in for Bernie in 2016, but with Warren in the race, some of the weaker parts of his candidacy are magnified,\u201d Mr. Simonson said. \u201cHe\u2019s got a very reasonable critique of the national Democratic Party institution, but from campaigning so much on the outside, I don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll be ready to take the role of national standard-bearer for all Democrats after the convention.\u201d ",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 The campaign trail can bring fraught encounters for a presidential candidate. At a televised forum on L.G.B.T.Q. issues on Thursday, Senator Elizabeth Warren was asked to consider a hypothetical one. Suppose a supporter approached her and said: \u201cSenator, I\u2019m old-fashioned and my faith teaches me that marriage is between one man and one woman.\u201d How would she respond? \u201cWell, I\u2019m going to assume it\u2019s a guy who said that,\u201d Ms. Warren replied. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to say, then just marry one woman. I\u2019m cool with that.\u201d The audience laughed and applauded. About 10 seconds passed. \u201cAssuming you can find one,\u201d Ms. Warren added, to the delight of the crowd. Viral moments are coveted in the Democratic primary race, where they can serve as a magnet for online donations and bring much-needed attention to candidates struggling to stand out in a large field. Ms. Warren\u2019s answer appeared likely to turn into one of those moments, even though she is hardly struggling to attract attention to her campaign, having risen in the polls to rival former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. as a leading contender for the Democratic nomination. A video of her response at the forum immediately drew attention on Twitter, and the Warren campaign soon shared the moment on her feed as well. Below is a transcript of the exchange: CHRIS CUOMO: You ready for another question? ELIZABETH WARREN: You bet. CUOMO: All right. Morgan Cox, real estate investment firm in Dallas, Texas. He is the chair of the Human Rights Campaign board of directors. Morgan, thank you. WARREN: All right. Hi, Morgan. MORGAN COX: Chris, thank you so much. Hi, senator, thank you for being here. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re on the campaign trail \u2014 WARREN: I have been \u2014 COX: And you\u2019re approached \u2014 you have been, yes. And a supporter approaches you and says, \u201cSenator, I\u2019m old-fashioned and my faith teaches me that marriage is between one man and one woman.\u201d What is your response? WARREN: Well, I\u2019m going to assume it\u2019s a guy who said that. And I\u2019m going to say, then just marry one woman. I\u2019m cool with that. WARREN: Assuming you can find one.",

      "author": "Matt Flegenheimer",
      "content": "  WESTERVILLE, Ohio \u2014 Senator Elizabeth Warren looked down, performatively taken aback. She raised her hand to speak \u2014 surely it was her turn again. She shrugged a little. For about an hour on Tuesday, Ms. Warren had been the prime target of her debate rivals, compelled to defend as never before the hard-charging progressivism and soak-the-rich economic approach that has elevated her to the top of the polls. Beto O\u2019Rourke, the former Texas congressman, had a theory about all of that. \u201cSometimes, I think Senator Warren is more focused on being punitive or pitting some part of the country against the other,\u201d he said, using a question about the wealth tax to lash Ms. Warren\u2019s broader political philosophy, \u201cinstead of lifting people up and making sure this country comes together.\u201d Ms. Warren turned to Mr. O\u2019Rourke, then back to the cameras. \u201cSo, um, I\u2019m really shocked at the notion that anyone thinks I\u2019m punitive,\u201d she said. Perhaps. But she should not have been surprised. For months, Ms. Warren had moved largely unimpeded in her brisk jog to the front of the 2020 Democratic pack, coasting through debates without incident as her calls for \u201cbig structural change\u201d took hold and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. absorbed the unforgiving glare afforded the favorite. Time and again this year, moderators had invited Ms. Warren\u2019s top competitors to attack her. Time and again, they had done so gently, if at all. This time, Mr. O\u2019Rourke went after her. Pete Buttigieg, the millennial mayor of South Bend, Ind., did the same early in the evening in a slashing exchange on health care. Andrew Yang said she was wrong on the wealth tax. Senator Kamala Harris smiled as she and Ms. Warren sparred over whether to regulate President Trump\u2019s tweets. Mr. Biden initiated his most direct debate-stage confrontation with Ms. Warren to date, saying she was \u201cbeing vague\u201d in campaign proposals. This was Ms. Warren\u2019s reward for achieving co-front-runner (and maybe outright front-runner) status: persistent sniping from fellow Democrats who see her surge as the most urgent threat to their own paths to the nomination. Ms. Warren greeted the deluge with mixed success, never wobbling too precariously but retreating at times to the safe harbor of stump-speech platitudes. On occasion, she appeared so eager to avoid the fray that she could give the impression that she was not engaging with the substance. \u201cA yes-or-no question that didn\u2019t get a yes-or-no answer,\u201d Mr. Buttigieg observed at one point. The fresh antipathy was all the more striking for its contrast with the treatment of two fellow contenders whose campaigns have been consumed by drama of late. Shortly after his recent heart attack, Senator Bernie Sanders attracted little meaningful criticism, on policy matters or his health. He will receive a boost this weekend with the expected endorsement of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the New York congresswoman who has emerged as an impassioned gatekeeper of the left. And Mr. Biden, straining to keep his grip on the race, survived an early dissection of the impeachment inquiry that centers on Mr. Trump\u2019s urging of the Ukrainian president to investigate Mr. Biden and his son Hunter. While the candidates plainly saw little incentive in questioning whether Hunter Biden had traded on the family name in dealings abroad \u2014 lest they be seen as doing the president\u2019s bidding \u2014 their deference itself was damning: Other campaigns have long expected Mr. Biden to falter on his own, viewing Ms. Warren as the more nettlesome long-term headache, and the former vice president\u2019s performance on Tuesday quite likely did little to alter their calculation. The moment that Mr. Biden had prepared for came early. Asked about his son in the debate\u2019s opening minutes, Mr. Biden worked to summon the righteous fury and stern statesman\u2019s gaze perfected over his half-century in public life. \u201cMy son did nothing wrong,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cI did nothing wrong.\u201d At times, his delivery was wobbly, as it tends to be. He stopped and started a bit. He cited George Washington. But he worked toward the conclusion he has been repeating often on the campaign trail. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want me to be the candidate,\u201d Mr. Biden said of the president. \u201cHe is going after me because he knows if I get the nomination, I will beat him like a drum.\u201d Before the debate, several rivals had come to Mr. Biden\u2019s defense, plainly mindful of the limits and potential downsides of condemning peers so far this year \u2014 and of condemning Mr. Biden on this subject in particular. None made an issue of Mr. Biden\u2019s family on Tuesday. At the previous three debates, Mr. Biden had been the focus of attacks both glancing and sharply personal. Yet the candidates who have gone after Mr. Biden frontally \u2014 including Ms. Harris; Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former federal housing secretary; and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, who has left the race \u2014 have seen few lasting benefits. In some cases, such as Mr. Castro\u2019s, the effort appeared to backfire with some Democratic voters and officials who are eager to keep the focus on Mr. Trump. Taking on Ms. Warren brought risks of its own, given her popularity with the party\u2019s base and the scant evidence throughout this primary that voters are inclined to reward infighting of any sort. But less than four months before the Iowa caucuses, her competitors have determined that complacency will not suffice. Mr. Buttigieg was the first aggressor, a few minutes into the debate in Westerville. He had been asked about Ms. Warren\u2019s support for Medicare for All and her squishy responses to the question of whether middle-class taxes would rise under it. This was the candidate with \u201ca plan for everything,\u201d Mr. Buttigieg taunted, \u201cexcept this.\u201d Ms. Warren\u2019s head shot skyward. \u201cWe can pay for this,\u201d she insisted, repeating that \u201ccosts\u201d would rise only for the wealthy and declining to concede \u2014 as Mr. Sanders, her comrade-in-health-care-policy, has \u2014 that middle-class taxes would go up. Amy Klobuchar, a moderate Senate peer who has leveled few attacks from the stage all year, was having none of it. \u201cAt least Bernie\u2019s being honest here,\u201d she said. The debate, the fourth of the campaign, came during a period of momentum for Ms. Warren, who has moved into a lead position, topping Mr. Biden in some surveys both nationally and in early-voting primary states. At the previous debate, Mr. Biden quickly abandoned mannerly efforts to draw contrasts with her, and other high-polling rivals had until Tuesday largely refrained from issuing piercing criticism onstage. But in the lead-up to the debate, several contenders had telegraphed arguments against Ms. Warren. At a fund-raiser last week, Mr. Biden made an oblique jab, saying that to claim that Medicare for All is achievable without a significant increase of taxes \u201cnot just for the wealthy but across the board is just not honest.\u201d And on Tuesday morning, Mr. Buttigieg released a digital ad that swiped at Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders over their support for Medicare for All, a sweeping single-payer plan that would all but eliminate private health insurance. The two leading candidates had avoided flashes of explosive confrontation with each other until around the final half-hour of the debate, when Mr. Biden said, \u201cI\u2019m the only one who has gotten anything really big done,\u201d criticizing Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders for advocating overly general ideas on issues like health care. Ms. Warren went on to point to her role in helping to create the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau during the Obama administration. \u201cI agreed with the great job she did,\u201d Mr. Biden said. Turning to face Ms. Warren, jabbing his hand in her direction, the former vice president\u2019s voice rose. \u201cAnd I went out on the floor and got you votes. I got votes for that bill. I convinced people to vote for it. So let\u2019s get those things straight, too.\u201d Some in the room applauded. \u201cI am deeply grateful to President Obama,\u201d she said pointedly \u2014 as his vice president grinned \u2014 \u201cwho fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law, and I am deeply grateful to every single person who fought for it and who helped pass it into law.\u201d \u201cYou did a hell of a job at your job,\u201d Mr. Biden said, interrupting her. Less clear was Mr. Biden\u2019s appraisal of Ms. Warren in her new role: the co-favorite.",

We\u2019ll return to the holiday later. For now, here\u2019s a look at the more substantive things that happened in the race this week. Former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas ended his presidential campaign on Friday, saying he had concluded that \u201cthis campaign does not have the means to move forward successfully.\u201d \u201cMy service to the country will not be as a candidate or as the nominee,\u201d he said in a message to supporters. \u201cAcknowledging this now is in the best interests of those in the campaign; it is in the best interests of this party as we seek to unify around a nominee; and it is in the best interests of the country.\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke began his campaign as a potential front-runner, with some polls early in the year showing him as high as third place. But his numbers have steadily sunk, and by this month he was polling mostly at 2 percent or less. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts laid out how to pay for her \u201cMedicare for all\u201d plan on Friday, proposing $20.5 trillion in new spending through significant tax increases on businesses and wealthy Americans, but not, she said, on the middle class. Under Ms. Warren\u2019s plan, employer-sponsored health insurance would be eliminated and replaced by free government coverage for all Americans. Like Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, she would essentially eliminate medical costs for individuals, including premiums, deductibles and other out-of-pocket expenses. To fund it, she said that over the next decade, she would require employers to pay trillions of dollars, create a tax on financial transactions like stock trades, change how investment gains are taxed for the top 1 percent of households, and increase her signature wealth tax proposal for billionaires. She also proposed cutting $800 billion in military spending. Senator Kamala Harris of California, once in the top tier of the Democratic field, has fallen as low as 3 percent in recent polls. And on Wednesday, her campaign announced that it would lay off some aides, reduce top staffers\u2019 pay and throw its full weight into Iowa. In a memo to staff members, Ms. Harris\u2019s campaign manager, Juan Rodriguez, said the layoffs and pay reductions would free up enough money for more than $1 million in advertising. Mr. Rodriguez also took a thinly veiled jab at Juli\u00e1n Castro and Cory Booker, who raised money by telling supporters they would drop out otherwise. A successful campaign, he wrote, must \u201cmake difficult strategic decisions and make clear priorities, not threaten to drop out or deploy gimmicks.\u201d About that fund-raising effort from Mr. Castro, the former housing secretary: As we mentioned last week, he had announced that he would end his campaign if he didn\u2019t raise $800,000 by Oct. 31. Well, Oct. 31 was Thursday, and (surprise!) Mr. Castro\u2019s team announced Friday that he made it. \u201cWe\u2019re not going anywhere,\u201d his campaign manager, Maya Rupert, said in a statement. \u201cJuli\u00e1n will keep being a voice for the voiceless, and a champion for the Americans who have been left behind.\u201d Four Democratic presidential candidates are locked in a close race in Iowa, according to a New York Times/Siena College poll of likely caucusgoers released on Friday. The survey puts Ms. Warren (22 percent) slightly ahead of Mr. Sanders (19 percent), Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. (18 percent), and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. (17 percent). We\u2019ve got a few Halloween treats for you this weekend. First off, we like polls, and Monmouth University, one of the most highly respected polling groups out there, gave us this very serious survey on how Americans feel about Halloween. One takeaway: 36 percent of Americans picked Reese\u2019s Peanut Butter Cups as their favorite candy, making it the clear leader. Mr. Buttigieg, Ms. Harris, Mr. O\u2019Rourke and Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado were among the candidates who picked it as their favorite in a survey done by our colleagues in Opinion. They were also asked to name the worst candy. The entrepreneur Andrew Yang expressed his distaste for candy corn and offered the following observation: \u201cThere are better candies and better corn.\u201d Finally, we leave you with this video from Ms. Warren, whose dog, Bailey, channeled his inner tax policy wonk this year, appearing as his mom\u2019s two-cent wealth tax.

      "author": "Lisa Lerer",
      "content": " Hi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I\u2019m Lisa Lerer, your host, bringing you a dispatch from my weekend reporting trip to Iowa. Democrats put on quite a show Friday night in Des Moines at their Liberty & Justice Celebration, a 13-candidate event considered the start of the final, three-month sprint to the Iowa caucuses. There were smoke machines! Spotlights! A runway! And, of course, thundersticks! Was this W.W.E.? No, it was the Iowa Democratic Party\u2019s annual dinner. Somehow, amid the shouts of the booming announcer and the migraine-inducing glare of thousands of glow sticks, it became clear to me that the race has entered a new phase. There has been no defining moment. No devastating gaffe. But over the past few weeks, the race in Iowa has begun to take a very different form than it had when the candidates sweated through the state fair just three months ago. For months, this was a contest between two of the biggest boldface names in Democratic politics \u2014 former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Now, the number of leading contenders has essentially doubled, creating a four-way race with Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders, yes, but also with Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. A New York Times/Siena College poll of likely caucusgoers taken last week showed those four candidates knotted at the top of the field. As I wrote with my colleague Reid Epstein over the weekend, the energy seems to be with the two fresher faces, who used the dinner as a display of organizational force. Mr. Buttigieg, helped by a cheering section of around 1,000 superfans who flew in from across the country to attend the dinner, cast himself as the heir to President Barack Obama\u2019s political legacy in his remarks \u2014 a direct shot at one of Mr. Biden\u2019s central arguments. Ms. Warren used her speech to debut a new line of attack against Mr. Biden, Mr. Buttigieg and her other centrist rivals. \u201cAnyone who comes on this stage and tells you to dream small and give up early is not going to lead our party to victory,\u201d she said. The attack underscored how questions about her \u201cMedicare for all\u201d plan have become central to this race. The Friday release of Ms. Warren\u2019s long-awaited, $20.5 trillion proposal explaining how she would fund the program prompted a new series of attacks over the weekend about the plan\u2019s specifics and whether she is being honest about the price tag. Her campaign plans to release a proposal detailing how she would manage the transition from private health insurance plans to universal government-run health coverage. But the questions are likely to trail her for the foreseeable future. Also worth noting from this weekend: The supersized field has finally begun shrinking to merely pleasantly plump. Former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas dropped out on Friday night, and rumors abound of other exits that could be coming soon. Of course, not everything has changed. As has been the case since the start of this crowded contest, most of the field has found it all but impossible to break out of the single digits in polling. At the dinner, Senators Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota delivered strong performances \u2014 to a half-empty room. (Both had the unlucky draw of speaking toward the end of the five-hour program.) And they had it far better than some of the candidates who followed. Former Representative John Delaney of Maryland was introduced with photos of Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana on the screens. And Mr. Bullock delivered the final address of the event \u2014 after being announced as Mr. Booker. Want more about Ms. Warren? Check out this story I wrote for the paper today with the ace business reporter Kate Kelly. We dive into the fury that her rise in the polls has ignited on Wall Street, where money mangers, investors and bankers are contemplating voting for President Trump, threatening to leave the country and loudly predicting a double-digit dive in the market if Ms. Warren is elected. Ms. Warren and her campaign see their rage as more beneficial than any monetary contribution. The joke making the rounds among Democrats on Wall Street is that every time a banker complains, Ms. Warren gets another thousand votes in Iowa. We want to hear from our readers. Have a question? We\u2019ll try to answer it. Have a comment? We\u2019re all ears. Email us at onpolitics@nytimes.com. As several states go to the polls, we\u2019ll have live results on NYTimes.com and in the NYTimes app on Tuesday night. Here\u2019s a cheat sheet from our colleague Trip Gabriel: Three states have particularly consequential elections on Tuesday. Kentucky and Mississippi are choosing governors in unexpectedly competitive races. But perhaps the biggest attraction is in Virginia, where control of the state legislature is up for grabs. Two years ago, the majority in the state\u2019s House of Delegates turned on a random drawing to settle a tied race. If Democrats reverse the slim majorities that Republicans hold in both chambers \u2014 as polling and a court-ordered new map of key districts suggest is likely \u2014 it will cap off a decade-long evolution of a Southern state, the former seat of the Confederacy, into a progressive bastion. With a sitting Democratic governor, Ralph Northam, new Democratic majorities in the legislature would be expected to advance liberal priorities on gun restrictions, the minimum wage, health care and civil rights protections for women and L.G.B.T. people. Perhaps most important to Democrats, unified control of state government would put the party in charge of mapping new voting districts in 2021. Virginia, which holds elections every year, has been at the forefront of a national revolt against President Trump among suburban voters since 2017. Tuesday night\u2019s returns are certain to be interpreted as a report card on Mr. Trump ahead of 2020. But Virginia is not an ideal presidential bellwether. Republicans have not won a statewide election there since 2009. These elections, like local elections everywhere now, are a kind of referendum on the president; but the simple toting up of W\u2019s and L\u2019s will not be especially meaningful. More telling will be the intensity of both parties\u2019 voters. Look for the margins of victory or loss, and the overall turnout, which nonpartisan analysts think will be in the mid-40s.

      "content": "  CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa \u2014 For months, the presidential race in Iowa was a contest between two titans of the Democratic political world, each representing distinct poles of a party struggling to define its identity in the Trump era. Now, with just three months to go before the caucuses, the ideological debate has remained the same, but the key players have shifted. For now, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is being eclipsed by Mayor Pete Buttigieg, of South Bend, Ind., a Midwestern mayor less than half his age who has captured the energy of those looking for the party to move in a more centrist direction. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has seen much of the message that had lifted him to political fame in the 2016 primary contest co-opted by Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. In polling, enthusiasm and organization, there is now a yawning gap between Ms. Warren, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Biden, Mr. Buttigieg and the other 13 Democrats running for president. A poll taken this week of likely caucusgoers by The New York Times and Siena College shows the top four candidates locked in a virtual tie atop the field, with the next contenders \u2014 starting with Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, at least 13 percentage points behind. [The latest data and analysis to keep track of who\u2019s leading the race to be the Democratic nominee.] Yet, in a field that once numbered two dozen, it is Ms. Warren and Mr. Buttigieg who have emerged as coveted fresh faces, riding a surge of momentum. Both have been rising for months \u2014 Mr. Buttigieg from the obscurity of leading a community of 100,000 people and Ms. Warren from early campaign missteps highlighted by her ill-fated decision to release a DNA test designed to combat charges that she exaggerated her Native American ancestry. With three months to go, the emergence of Ms. Warren and Mr. Buttigieg has confirmed that the race is entering a new phase, as Mr. Biden struggles to regain momentum and Mr. Sanders attempts to expand his base beyond his core supporters. \u201cThe Sanders people are mostly the same people that were Sanders people in 2016, but there seem to be fewer of them,\u201d said JoAnn Hardy, the Democratic Party chairwoman in Cerro Gordo County, Iowa. \u201cSome of them have moved on to other campaigns, not necessarily all to Warren. Warren has a wider supporter base than just former Bernie supporters.\u201d Mr. Buttigieg himself declared the contest to be a \u201ctwo-way race\u201d in an interview with the Showtime television show \u201cThe Circus,\u201d a comment that irked several others in the presidential race. \u201cAnybody who thinks that this is a two-person race right now doesn\u2019t know Iowa,\u201d former Housing Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro told reporters Saturday. For months Mr. Biden led polls in Iowa, but he has seen his support steadily shrink as other candidates have focused their time and attention on the state. [Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter.] \u201cSome of the early Biden support was name recognition, some was familiarity, some was affection and respect,\u201d said Kurt Meyer, the Democratic Party chairman of Mitchell County, Iowa. \u201cBut much of it had to be renewed and extended, much as one would renew a thick book at the local library, for it to last until early February.\u201d That has left many of the remaining 13 candidates scrambling for attention, relevance and desperately needed campaign dollars. Much of the debate among the quartet of top contenders this weekend centered around Ms. Warren\u2019s long-awaited, $20.5 trillion proposal explaining how she would fund \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d which she released on Friday. Mr. Biden on Saturday bristled at Ms. Warren\u2019s suggestion that he was borrowing Republican talking points about her health care proposal, while at the same time accusing her of peddling plans that have no chance of being enacted as law. \u201cTo say that you\u2019re a Republican or you\u2019re not loyal or you have no courage if you don\u2019t agree with such and such a position is no way to get anything passed, I promise you,\u201d Mr. Biden told reporters after speaking at a fish fry hosted by first-term Representative Abby Finkenauer. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t even get it passed. You have to be able to reach out.\u201d For Ms. Warren, the weekend marked the beginning of a crucial stretch during which she would be compelled to sell her new plan to voters. Though not all of her supporters had familiarized themselves with the details on Saturday morning, many seemed inclined to give her the benefit of the doubt. \u201cShe is passionate about what she\u2019s saying,\u201d said Renee Lapan-Islas, 50, who came to see Ms. Warren speak in Vinton, Iowa. \u201cWe struggle for money at times because of health care.\u201d But Ms. Warren also faced a skeptical question from a voter with Type 1 diabetes, who expressed concern about the continuity of care under Ms. Warren\u2019s proposed transition to \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d \u201cHealth care is a basic human right, and we fight for basic human rights,\u201d Ms. Warren said, adding that the approach was \u201cabout strengthening America\u2019s middle class\u201d and arguing that failing to dramatically overhaul the health care system would be calamitous over the long haul. At the fish fry, which drew the race\u2019s seven leading candidates to a Cedar Rapids racetrack that has become a regular stop on the Democratic presidential campaign trail, the candidates parried question about rural infrastructure, river flooding and labor rights \u2014 the sort of bread-and-butter issues Ms. Finkenauer used last year to oust a Republican incumbent. Ms. Finkenauer\u2019s mother baked 750 cupcakes, which were heartily consumed by activists, campaign staffers and the assembled press. Other candidates, too, recognized the new order. Mr. Biden declared Ms. Warren\u2019s health care proposal to be divisive. Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado and Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana denigrated the population of South Bend as relatively insignificant. The weekend began with the Liberty & Justice Celebration, a party dinner seen as the last major candidate gathering before the caucuses. While 13 candidates spoke, only about half drew any kind of notable support and, of those, Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Warren were the only ones to draw thunderous applause from their speeches. The weekend marked the latest public test of each campaign\u2019s organizational prowess. The campaigns purchase tickets for the Friday night dinner, hoping to pack the hall with their supporters. Instead of rallying supporters for his speech, Mr. Sanders led a march that his campaign said attracted 1,500 people in the Des Moines drizzle. His aides said the campaign focused on organizing volunteers for the February caucus rather than a visible demonstration of enthusiasm inside the arena. Mr. Biden hosted no such demonstration: Before the event began, allies of Mr. Biden quietly collected signs and noisemakers that had been placed out for supporters who never arrived. At the end of his remarks, Mr. Biden asked the audience to \u201cget up\u201d and defeat President Trump. Nearly everyone remained seated.",

      "author": "Katie Glueck",
      "content": " COLUMBUS, Ohio \u2014 A day after their fiercest debate-stage confrontation to date, Joseph R. Biden Jr. escalated his criticism of his most formidable rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, suggesting that she was not being forthright about the costs of her far-reaching policy proposals and questioning her \u201ccredibility.\u201d Mr. Biden zeroed in on Ms. Warren\u2019s refusal to say if she would raise taxes on middle-class Americans to pay for \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d a single-payer health care system that would all but eliminate private health insurance. While other candidates are pouncing on that issue as well, Mr. Biden is under particular pressure because Ms. Warren has passed him in some national and early-state polls and joined him as a front-runner, a status he held alone for months. \u201cIt\u2019s fascinating that the person who has a plan for everything has no plan for the single most consequential issue in this election in the minds of the American people across the board,\u201d Mr. Biden said, addressing reporters on a cold, gray afternoon outside a union electrical trade center. \u201cAnd, you know, credibility matters. It matters. And the question that I think that Senator Warren is going to have to face, she\u2019s going to have to tell the truth or the question will be raised about whether or not she\u2019s going to be candid and honest with the American people,\u201d he said. He noted that she supports several ambitious proposals, including a tax on the wealth of the richest Americans, and said she should be pressed for details on how to implement them. \u201cThe last thing the Democrats should be doing is playing Trump\u2019s game, trying to con the American people to think this is easy,\u201d Mr. Biden said. Ms. Warren\u2019s team did not respond directly to Mr. Biden\u2019s attacks on policy matters, instead skewering his campaign\u2019s reliance on high-dollar fund-raising events. \u201cInstead of speaking to wealthy donors, our campaign spent the day calling and thanking over a thousand of our grass-roots supporters,\u201d said Kristen Orthman, the communications director for Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign. \u201cOther than that we have no comment.\u201d Mr. Biden and his allies have been previewing attacks on Ms. Warren for more than a month, swiping at her affection for sweeping policy plans and casting them as unrealistic or polarizing. But at last month's presidential debate, the two barely clashed. That dynamic changed dramatically on Tuesday, when Mr. Biden accused Ms. Warren of \u201cbeing vague\u201d in her proposals. Ms. Warren went on to detail her work in helping to create the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau under the Obama administration, leading to a tense exchange with Mr. Biden, who was vice president at the time. \u201cI went out on the floor and got you votes,\u201d Mr. Biden said, his voice rising and hand pointing in Ms. Warren\u2019s direction. \u201cSo let\u2019s get those things straight, too.\u201d Mr. Biden is now confronting a series of challenges: a third-quarter fund-raising haul that fell well behind the totals of Ms. Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont; struggles in some early state polls; and scrutiny on his family after revelations that President Trump asked the Ukrainian government to investigate Mr. Biden and his son Hunter. There is no evidence that Mr. Biden, as vice president, acted improperly to aid his son\u2019s overseas business dealings, but the development has emerged as a major distraction to his campaign, though his national polling numbers have generally remained steady since the Ukraine controversy broke last month. On Wednesday, Mr. Biden again sought to put that story line behind him, repeatedly working to bring the focus back to Mr. Trump and casting him as dangerous and corrupt. \u201cMr. President, release your tax returns or shut up,\u201d he said at one point, looking directly into the assembled cameras. And Mr. Biden, who often talks about civility, appeared far more eager to seize opportunities to tweak his Democratic rivals than he has on many previous occasions. \u201cGod love Bernie, you know it was really good, I really mean it, to see him so healthy and moving last night,\u201d Mr. Biden said of Mr. Sanders, who recently suffered a heart attack. \u201cBut Bernie! Bernie doesn\u2019t pay for half his plan.\u201d Asked about Ms. Warren\u2019s remark at the debate, that the United States should \u201cget out of the Middle East,\u201d Mr. Biden, a former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, embraced the chance to attempt to draw another contrast. \u201cI quite frankly was surprised,\u201d he said. \u201cI have never heard anyone say, with any serious background in foreign policy, that we pull all troops out of the Middle East.\u201d Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign has clarified that she was referring to combat troops. Later Wednesday, Mr. Biden gave a foreign policy address in Iowa where he briefly referenced that moment, again noting his surprise at her remarks before turning back to his foreign policy agenda. To some extent, Mr. Biden\u2019s attack is part of a broader effort to cast himself as uniquely qualified on foreign policy, an argument he made explicitly in his speech in Iowa. \u201cTrump is demolishing the moral authority of the United States of America,\u201d he said, and the next president will have to handle foreign relations in \u201cwhatever the state of disarray Trump leaves it in.\u201d \u201cWe need a leader who can on Day 1 pick up the phone, call our NATO allies, know them by their first names, and know and have them know there will be no question about the word of the next president of the United States,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cI\u2019ve personally met and built relationships with almost every world leader that\u2019s still on the stage.\u201d",

      "content": "  Julia Roberts was making the rounds at Blackstone, and no one at the giant private equity firm was particularly happy to see her. In mid-July, a video featuring a clip of Ms. Roberts in the movie \u201cPretty Woman\u201d ping-ponged through inboxes of Blackstone employees. The video, produced by Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s office to promote a legislative campaign, showed a scene in a hotel suite where Richard Gere, playing a suave investor, admits to a young Ms. Roberts that his work was akin to stealing cars and then selling off the parts. Ms. Warren\u2019s tagline: \u201cStop Wall Street looting.\u201d The pitch went largely unnoticed publicly. But at Blackstone, a titan of Wall Street, the video was received with a mix of frustration and incredulity, people who work at the firm said. They aren\u2019t the only ones: From corporate boardrooms to breakfast meetings, investor conferences to charity galas, Ms. Warren\u2019s rise in the Democratic primary polls is rattling bankers, investors and their affluent clients, who see in the Massachusetts senator a formidable opponent who could damage not only their industry but their way of life. It\u2019s a role that Ms. Warren unabashedly embraces, as an increasing number of voters, as well as a few veterans of the finance industry, see her as the policymaker who can address the growing wealth gap in the United States and take on the corruption and excess in the business world. Ms. Warren has made battling corporate greed and corruption a central theme of her fiercely populist campaign, mixing anti-elitist oratory with policy plans calling for sweeping new regulations. On Friday morning she released an ambitious proposal to pay for her \u201cMedicare for all\u201d program, with provisions directly affecting Wall Street: aggressive new taxes on billionaires, an additional tax on financial transactions like stock trades and annual investment gains taxes for the wealthiest households. Just hours later she told an audience in Iowa: \u201cOur democracy has been hijacked by the rich and the powerful.\u201d Interviews with more than two dozen hedge-fund managers, private-equity and bank officials, analysts and lobbyists made clear that Ms. Warren has stirred more alarm than any other Democratic candidate. (Senator Bernie Sanders, who describes himself as a socialist, is also feared, but is considered less likely to capture the nomination.) Wall Street has long tried to influence American politics and generally donated to both parties, though it traditionally has been more aligned with Republicans. But while there\u2019s no coordinated strategy, the industry is more or less united against Ms. Warren. With just months before the first voting begins, it is unleashing a barrage of public attacks, donating money to her rivals and scrambling to counter her blistering narrative about Wall Street.  \u201cEveryone is nervous,\u201d said Steven Rattner, a prominent Democratic donor who manages the wealth of Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor. \u201cWhat scares the hell out of me is the way she would fundamentally change our free-enterprise system.\u201d While even some of Ms. Warren\u2019s detractors see her soak-the-rich approach as a winning issue in the Democratic primary, President Trump and his team would undoubtedly try to weaponize it against her in a general election. Already, some Republicans are defining Ms. Warren as a veiled socialist who would disrupt the fragile economy with her sweeping plans. As president, Ms. Warren would also confront a long list of powerful and well-funded opponents on Wall Street, potentially complicating her ability to enact her agenda. Her tightly organized campaign has no Wall Street liaison or circle of advisers drawn from the industry and has done little outreach to the finance world. Yet even if Ms. Warren cannot get some of her more far-reaching proposals through Congress, finance executives fear that as president she would appoint regulators who take a far stricter view of the industry. Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign declined to comment, pointing to her public remarks, in which she has welcomed doing battle with Wall Street. In recent weeks, Wall Street\u2019s warning signals about Ms. Warren have begun exploding into the public, coloring analyst reports and earnings calls, and echoing from the stages of industry conferences. The billionaire money manager Leon Cooperman castigated her in an open letter released Thursday, and on Friday Goldman Sachs researchers suggested that tax hikes proposed by Ms. Warren and others could lower corporate earnings by 11 percent. Prominent money managers have predicted a double-digit decline in the stock market if Ms. Warren wins the presidency, a claim that some skeptics find hyperbolic. Some traders and investors have said, only half-kiddingly, that they\u2019ll leave the country \u2014 or at least, relatively high-tax states like New York \u2014 to minimize the impact of what they view as punitive policies. The wariness exists even in more friendly Democratic terrain. When prospective donors to the Black Economic Alliance, a nonpartisan political action committee focused on bettering the economic lives of black Americans, gathered one evening last month, the conversation quickly turned into a debate over Ms. Warren, according to someone who attended. Over dinner at Michael\u2019s in midtown Manhattan, some attendees suggested they would consider not voting in the general election if Ms. Warren won the nomination. They objected to her proposed \u201cultra-millionaire tax,\u201d a 2 percent annual tax on households worth $50 million to $1 billion that would constrain people\u2019s ability to pass their wealth on to their children. Ms. Warren\u2019s many policy plans take aim not only at multimillionaire pocketbooks, but also the financial responsibilities of banks and investment firms. Yet many Wall Street officials believe that Ms. Warren does not understand modern-day investing and lending, does not respect financial companies and is demonizing those who work in the markets. Mitch Draizin, a former fund-raiser for Mr. Obama who made his money in the financial industry, said he would back Ms. Warren\u2019s candidacy against Mr. Trump\u2019s. But he is supporting former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. this time, worried about Ms. Warren\u2019s disruptive approach. \u201cShe would be just as unpredictable and unproductive as Trump if she were to become president, and who needs that,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s getting a little carried away and to me it\u2019s irresponsible.\u201d On the campaign trail, she has emphasized that she is pushing only for fairness and accountability. She describes herself as a capitalist and says she believes in markets \u2014 as long as they have rules. And unlike Mr. Sanders, Ms. Warren has not argued that billionaires should not exist; she wants them to pay much higher taxes than they do now. \u201cUnderstand I\u2019m not proposing this because I\u2019m cranky,\u201d she said at a stop in New Hampshire recently.  Yet, it\u2019s also clear that Ms. Warren and her campaign see this fight as a political winner, one that can bolster her populist appeal. Indeed, a number of Democrats on Wall Street have dryly noted that every time their colleagues complain in the press, Ms. Warren picks up more votes in Iowa. Even within the finance community, she has supporters \u2014 some of whom view Wall Street opposition as a thinly veiled attempt to fend off any policies that affect profits. \u201cThe greed of Wall Street, of area code 212 types, has just gotten absolutely carried away, and it needs to be rolled back,\u201d said Marc Cohodes, a longtime short-seller who bets against troubled companies. Of Ms. Warren, he said, \u201cShe would be great, I think she would be a breath of fresh air.\u201d Ms. Warren has already collected campaign donations from employees of JPMorgan Chase, Barclays, and the asset-management firm Point72, among others. Wall Street\u2019s allergy to regulation is nothing new. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, despite the industry\u2019s rampant risk taking, financial institutions successfully beat back proposed curbs on their leverage, lending and use of exotic financial instruments. Even in the aftermath of the recession, banks and financial firms battled the implementation of the 2010 Dodd-Frank act, which imposed broad restrictions on banks and trading. Now, in ways big and small, Wall Street has begun bracing for a possible Warren administration. Some money managers and traders are testing something they call the \u201cWarren trade\u201d: either a bet that U.S. stocks will fall next November on the news of her victory, or that certain stocks in areas she plans to regulate aggressively \u2014 like health care, energy, and finance \u2014 will fall during the period between now and late 2020. Private equity executives \u2014 who believe the \u201cPretty Woman\u201d video gives an outdated and inaccurate view of their business \u2014 have also begun extolling the virtues of their business, kicking off a kind of pre-emptive public relations effort. Their lobbying organization, the American Investment Council, is promoting the industry as a job creator in op-eds, interviews and a digital ad campaign. And Blackstone\u2019s chief executive officer, Stephen Schwarzman, said recently that his firm has created 100,000 more jobs than it has cut in the last 15 years. Business executives are also donating to Ms. Warren\u2019s more moderate challengers, hoping to boost candidates with less transformative visions for revamping the economy. Of the roughly 1,400 biggest donors to Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign, just under 2 percent have so far given the maximum contribution to Ms. Warren, according to a New York Times analysis. That\u2019s a far lower percentage than those who gave to rivals like Mr. Biden. Ms. Warren also ranks well down the list in money raised from individual donors in the finance industry.  She has raised about $330,000, according to year-to-date figures compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics, far less than Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who leads the Democrats with nearly $1.3 million. (At about $1.5 million, Mr. Trump is the biggest beneficiary of finance-industry donations.) In her presidential campaign, Ms. Warren has eschewed donations from corporate PACs and bundlers, swearing off big donor events as she collects a flood of small donations that have put her among the race\u2019s leading fund-raisers. Last month, her campaign announced that they would no longer accept contributions of more than $200 from executives at big banks, hedge funds or private equity firms. Ms. Warren\u2019s Stop Wall Street Looting Act mandates that private-equity firms guarantee the debt of any companies they buy, a move that would make their corporate investments far more risky and possibly dampen their ability to make profits for investors. She has also proposed reinstating the Glass-Steagall Act, the landmark legislation that separated commercial banking from investment banking for decades before its repeal in 1999. The effect of such sweeping measures, some market participants say, could be profound. \u201cI am a fan of Elizabeth Warren, but electing her may be a case of \u2018be careful what you wish for,\u2019\u201d said Jamie Lester, a former hedge-fund analyst who now works as a consultant. \u201cI don\u2019t think she realizes how fragile our economy and financial system are, and she will be driving a bulldozer through them.\u201d",

      "author": "Thomas Kaplan",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 When Senator Elizabeth Warren laid out her plan for \u201cMedicare for all\u201d on Friday, she said she would raise taxes on the top 1 percent of households to help pay for it. The middle class, she said, would not pay \u201cone penny\u201d more. On Saturday night, Ms. Warren presented an even narrower description of who would face higher taxes under her plan. She told reporters that billionaires would be the only people to see their taxes go up \u2014 a misstatement of what she had proposed a day earlier. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t raise taxes on anybody but billionaires,\u201d Ms. Warren told reporters in Dubuque, Iowa, when asked what income bracket she defined as \u201cmiddle class.\u201d She added, \u201cAnd you know what? The billionaires can afford it.\u201d Anyone with under $1 billion in net worth, she said, \u201cis not paying a penny more.\u201d Asked again how she defined middle class, she repeated the assertion. \u201cUnderstand this,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is no increase in taxes for anyone except billionaires. Period. Done.\u201d But that is not what she proposed on Friday. Ms. Warren\u2019s plan for Medicare for all, which calls for $20.5 trillion in new federal spending over a decade, would be financed through a mix of sources, including taxes on businesses and $3 trillion in total from two proposals to tax wealthy Americans. One of those measures would steepen her proposed wealth tax on net worth above $1 billion. But the other \u2014 accounting for $2 trillion of the $3 trillion total \u2014 would go far beyond billionaires. For the top 1 percent of households, Ms. Warren would increase taxes on investment gains. She would put in place a new system in which capital gains are taxed annually instead of when investments are sold, and she would raise the tax rate on capital gains to be the same as on ordinary income like wages. Asked about Ms. Warren\u2019s comments, a spokeswoman for her campaign acknowledged that taxes would increase for the top 1 percent, but said Ms. Warren had been referring to her wealth tax proposal when she said taxes would increase only for billionaires. The campaign of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., one of Ms. Warren\u2019s top rivals, quickly criticized her over the comments. \u201cThe American people have to be able to trust whoever our party nominates to take on Donald Trump to be straight with them about health care,\u201d Kate Bedingfield, a deputy campaign manager for Mr. Biden, said in a statement late Saturday night. \u201cSenator Warren said tonight that her single-payer plan won\u2019t raise taxes on anyone but billionaires, but that\u2019s simply not true.\u201d Ms. Bedingfield argued that two other taxes proposed by Ms. Warren would also affect a broader population than just billionaires: a tax on employers that is similar to what they are currently spending on their employees\u2019 health care, and a tax on financial transactions like stock trades. The issue of Medicare for all has been a major and escalating point of tension between Ms. Warren and Mr. Biden, and a central fault line in the Democratic presidential primary. Mr. Biden supports adding a public health insurance option that people can purchase and building on the Affordable Care Act. He has cast Ms. Warren\u2019s more expansive plan as costly and unrealistic, telling reporters in Des Moines on Saturday that \u201cgetting that plan through even a Democratic Congress would be difficult.\u201d Ms. Warren\u2019s proposal to increase taxes on investment gains did not precisely describe how she would define the top 1 percent of households. In 2017, the top 1 percent of tax returns had income above roughly $515,000, according to the Internal Revenue Service \u2014 about 1.4 million tax returns in total. Earlier this year, Forbes said there were 607 billionaires in the United States. The other measure to tax wealthy Americans that Ms. Warren put forward on Friday would increase her proposed wealth tax on net worth above $1 billion to 6 percent annually, from 3 percent. (Her wealth tax also includes a 2 percent tax on net worth over $50 million, but that remains unchanged from what she proposed in January.) On Sunday, speaking to reporters in Davenport, Iowa, Ms. Warren offered a broader description of who would face higher taxes under her proposal. \u201cWe ask the big corporations and the top 1 percent,\u201d she said, \u201cto pay a little more.\u201d",

A Run for President Is One OptionMichael Bloomberg may join a 2020 field where some leading candidates are railing against wealth like his. It\u2019s complicated.By Matt FlegenheimerPRINT EDITIONFor Very Rich,  A Rocky Path  Paved in Gold|November 9, 2019, Page A1",
      "author": "Matt Flegenheimer",
      "content": " There is probably never a bad time to be a billionaire. But this, at least, is an especially complicated one. Yes, one billionaire is president \u2014 if President Trump\u2019s financial self-assessments are to be believed, in lieu of his tax returns \u2014 and at least one more, Tom Steyer, is running to succeed him. Yet as a more famous and formidable avatar of the mega-rich, former New York City mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, moves toward a run of his own in a 2020 Democratic primary defined largely by economic inequality, he is stepping into a public moment uniquely fraught for the three-comma set. Across politics, technology and popular culture, the wisdom and purpose of the extremely wealthy is being questioned as never before. Billionaires, led by Bill Gates and the hedge fund manager Leon Cooperman, have quarreled this week with one of the top Democratic contenders, Senator Elizabeth Warren, over the way she talks about affluence. Mark Zuckerberg, no longer lionized as the Facebook wunderkind in an unpretentious hoodie, has been hauled before Congress for televised floggings over privacy and advertising standards. Adam Neumann of WeWork has been scorned as an archetype of start-up chicanery, walking away with a $185 million \u201cconsulting fee\u201d and potentially far more in sold-off shares after effectively running the company into the ground. HBO has built a hit show, \u201cSuccession,\u201d around the dim morality of an ultrawealthy media family. So convoluted are the billionaire wars that on Friday, the Democratic primary descended into multibillionaire sniping: Mr. Steyer, seeking to distinguish himself from his would-be rival, called on Mr. Bloomberg to either support a wealth tax or sit out the primary. \u201cI missed that,\u201d said Howard Wolfson, a top adviser to Mr. Bloomberg, when told of Mr. Steyer\u2019s challenge. \u201cIs he still running?\u201d Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s allies plainly see him as a more credible contender \u2014 not just a business giant but a former three-term mayor of the country\u2019s largest city, with a national reputation buoyed by high-dollar philanthropy and activism on gun control and environmental issues. \u201cHe\u2019s run for office three times as a billionaire and won three times,\u201d Mr. Wolfson said, adding that voters valued that he was self-made. \u201cIt\u2019s not the first time he\u2019s been attacked for being a billionaire.\u201d Still, in the years since Mr. Bloomberg left office, polls have shown a wide-scale distrust of billionaires, once celebrated as the pinnacle of American achievement. Many Democratic candidates have done the math \u2014 99.999999 percent is larger than .000001 percent \u2014 and campaigned accordingly. Senator Bernie Sanders has said he does not believe billionaires should exist at all. Ms. Warren has delighted in taunting them with a customized tax-bill calculator on her website, infusing her stump speech with a faux-sympathetic \u201cawwwwww\u201d after telling voters about the very-upper-class opposition to her wealth tax proposal. At an event in Greensboro, N.C., on Thursday, which found Ms. Warren onstage for a word association game with an interviewer, one of the prompts was \u201cbillionaires.\u201d \u201cBoohoo,\u201d she said, breaking into mock tears. Such is the unsubtlety of the nation\u2019s present debate: a real-time collision of topple-the-plutocracy candidates and actual plutocrats in the same presidential field, injecting the race with a raft of questions that suddenly seem less academic: In a primary consumed by talk of corporate excesses, with top candidates mostly in their 70s, can Mr. Bloomberg, a 77-year-old titan of high finance, really find a major audience? Might his entry only boost the progressive candidates whose ascent \u2014 coupled with the stumbles of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. \u2014 so troubled Mr. Bloomberg in the first place, supplying them with another flesh-and-blood billionaire against whom they can make their case? And, at a more fundamental level, what does America expect of its billionaires in 2019? How are they supposed to behave when the first line on their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, the one they worked so hard to acquire, is liable to attract suspicion from a not-insignificant segment of the population? \u201cTo whom much is given, much is required,\u201d said Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, who clashed often with Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s education team when he was mayor. \u201cThere is great income and wealth inequality in this country, greater than any other time since the Gilded Age. If a billionaire is going to run, a billionaire has to understand that.\u201d Against this backdrop of simmering populist anger, growing since the Occupy movement of 2011 into a mainstream political force, several billionaires have stepped forward to defend their kind, particularly in reaction to Ms. Warren\u2019s policy plans, which stand to cost them considerably. Last month, Mr. Cooperman, the billionaire money manager, published a letter criticizing Ms. Warren\u2019s \u201cvilification of the rich.\u201d He told CNBC on Friday that Mr. Bloomberg has his support if he runs. Mr. Gates, speaking at The New York Times DealBook Conference this week, lamented the \u201cincentive system\u201d at play in Ms. Warren\u2019s tax proposals, wondering aloud if Ms. Warren would even \u201cbe willing to sit down with somebody, you know, who has large amounts of money.\u201d (Ms. Warren responded with a tweet offering to explain her ideas in person.) Earlier this year, Mr. Gates noted what he saw as an oddity of the modern age. \u201cIt is fascinating,\u201d he told Forbes, \u201cthat for the first time in my life, people are saying, \u2018O.K., should you have billionaires?\u2019\u201d Mr. Gates concluded that, yes, you should. But he allowed that a more \u201cneutral witness,\u201d someone without a billion dollars, might be a better messenger. Recent campaign history for billionaires is mixed, even for candidates investing tens of millions of dollars of their own money, often at minimum. There have been triumphs, including Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s three victories in New York and the election last year of J.B. Pritzker, the billionaire heir to the Hyatt hotel fortune who is now governor of Illinois. In 1992, Ross Perot, a twanging Texan who drew from his billions to become a factor in the presidential race between Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush, took 19 percent of the popular vote as an independent. Steve Forbes ran twice in Republican presidential primaries, 1996 and 2000, to little electoral effect. On this score, Mr. Trump is the most unalloyed success, fusing boardroom bravado and constant exaggeration to convince his supporters that his vast wealth was an asset. He even boasted of past donations to politicians as evidence that only an insider mogul \u2014 someone who knew the game was rigged because he had been rigging it \u2014 could be trusted to right such wrongs. Mr. Wolfson suggested that Mr. Bloomberg could offer his own take on an above-it-all pitch. \u201cThat was a powerful part of his appeal when he was mayor: He cannot be bought,\u201d Mr. Wolfson said, noting that Mr. Bloomberg favors raising taxes on \u201cupper-income earners.\u201d \u201cHe is unbought and unbossed.\u201d But thus far this cycle, candidates have struggled at times to connect their financial conquests to voters\u2019 experiences, supplying limited evidence that non-Trump entrepreneurs can find serious traction. Mr. Steyer, a hedge fund billionaire turned impeachment activist, has qualified for two Democratic debates but left little mark on the race to date, save for his ubiquitous advertising footprint and an Associated Press report that a top aide privately offered campaign contributions to local candidates willing to endorse Mr. Steyer. (The campaign apologized for \u201cany miscommunication\u201d it might have conveyed to these candidates. The aide offered his resignation on Friday.) Howard Schultz, the former chief executive of Starbucks, weighed an independent run this year before backing away. His flirtation was greeted most vocally by pleas from Mr. Trump\u2019s opponents, who viewed Mr. Schultz as an out-of-touch spoiler whose prospective bid would only help the president. \u201cThe obvious challenge is that everyone overlooks the drivers that turned these guys into billionaires,\u201d said Erin McPike, a former Schultz aide, \u201cand those are key qualifications.\u201d It has been a decade since Mr. Bloomberg last appeared on a ballot, inviting concerns that he may show significant rust as a candidate. Rarely folksy as mayor, he was prone to tin-eared flourishes, caricatured in the news media for spending weekends in Bermuda or urging snowed-in residents to take in a Broadway show during a blizzard. Some voters seem inclined to forgive any sins of tone, if the platform is right. \u201cJust because a guy\u2019s a billionaire doesn\u2019t make you a bad person,\u201d said Patrick Mirocha, 46, from Davenport, Iowa, a self-described liberal waiting to see Ms. Warren speak last weekend. In an address this spring to Harvard Business School\u2019s graduating class, Mr. Bloomberg perhaps hinted at the kind of message he might fashion to describe his own career. \u201cPeople have a hell of a lot more respect for those who make a difference in society than they do for people who just make money,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cGordon Gekko was wrong: Greed ain\u2019t good.\u201d On the question of greed, and whether too much power is concentrated in the hands of too few, the public seems to agree. A 2017 survey considered attitudes toward the ultrarich. It found that 53 percent of Americans distrusted billionaires, while 31 percent said they admired them.

      "author": "Alexander Burns",
      "content": " Hillary Clinton said Wednesday she hoped for a return to \u201cboring, normal times\u201d after the 2020 election, voicing skepticism of her party\u2019s populist wing and predicting that Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s proposal for single-payer health care would never get enacted. At The New York Times DealBook conference in New York, Mrs. Clinton said she saw two of the biggest policies embraced by the left in the 2020 Democratic primary \u2014 \u201cMedicare for all\u201d-style health care and a tax on the assets of the very wealthy \u2014 as unworkable or politically impractical. She said Democrats should pursue the goal of universal health coverage, but through other means. A longtime leader of her party\u2019s moderate wing, Mrs. Clinton was most blunt about Ms. Warren\u2019s proposal to replace private health insurance with a single-payer system funded largely by taxes on the wealthy and corporations. Asked if she thought that proposal could get passed into law, Mrs. Clinton answered in the negative. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the goal is the right goal.\u201d Mrs. Clinton did not criticize either Ms. Warren or Senator Bernie Sanders, the liberal populist who challenged Mrs. Clinton in the 2016 primary and who also supports Medicare for all, in harsh or personal terms. But she suggested that the approach to health care favored by both was misguided, saying that \u201cthe smarter approach is to build on what we have\u201d by adding the option of a public health care plan to the offerings of the Affordable Care Act. It is not a surprising preference for Mrs. Clinton: In the 2016 campaign, she supported introducing a public health insurance option but consistently rejected Mr. Sanders\u2019s calls for single-payer health care. Speaking on Thursday at North Carolina A&T State University in Greensboro, N.C., Ms. Warren was asked about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s remarks. \u201cI\u2019m saying, you don\u2019t get what you don\u2019t fight for,\u201d she said in response. \u201cYou know, you got to be willing to get out there and fight.\u201d Mrs. Clinton\u2019s comments suggest she remains skeptical of the populist forces on the rise in Democratic politics. While she did not endorse a candidate, she indicated a clear preference in one of the largest debates raging in the Democratic Party: whether to nominate a candidate who would make sweeping changes to the country\u2019s government and economy, or someone who would restore something like normalcy in Washington. \u201cI would like us to return to a presidency where we don\u2019t have to wake up every day worried,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said, adding, \u201cI\u2019d like us to get back to sort of boring, normal times.\u201d She also said she believed she knew who the Democratic nominee was \u201clikely to be,\u201d but declined to name that person. Mrs. Clinton, who has not entirely ruled out another run for the presidency but has taken no apparent steps toward a campaign, also sounded a note of skepticism about the detail-rich policy debates that have helped shape the Democratic primary so far. Those disputes during primary season, she said, do not always translate into actual governance after the election. Her 2008 primary battle with Barack Obama furnished an instructive case study, Mrs. Clinton said: During that campaign, Mr. Obama fiercely opposed her proposal for a government mandate that all individuals purchase health insurance, but he went on to include that very rule as president. The clash over health care unfolding in the primary now, she said, represented \u201ca very healthy debate.\u201d Of a tax on wealth, which is favored by both Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders, Mrs. Clinton questioned whether it could really function as its proponents intend. She said she would support other methods of taxing the rich, like raising income-tax rates, imposing stiffer estate taxes and eliminating certain provisions of the tax code that favor the financial sector. \u201cI think there are other ways to raise the revenues, and ways that do get those who are well-off to pay more, because I do think we\u2019ve got to have that as part of our effort to combat inequality,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. In theory, Mrs. Clinton herself could be subject to the wealth taxes proposed by Ms. Warren, who has called for a levy on fortunes over $50 million, and Mr. Sanders, who would impose a similar tax on fortunes greater than $32 million. Mrs. Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, have earned well over $100 million through paid speaking and book deals since the turn of the century.",

      "author": "Jonathan Martin",
      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 Democrats in the country\u2019s most pivotal general election battlegrounds prefer a moderate presidential nominee who would seek common ground with Republicans rather than pursue an ambitious, progressive agenda, according to a New York Times/Siena College poll of primary voters across six states. As the Democratic candidates intensify their argument over how best to defeat President Trump, their core voters in Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Arizona and Florida are counseling them to pursue a political middle ground. A majority of those surveyed said they wanted a Democratic nominee who is more moderate than most Democrats, and they overwhelmingly preferred one who would bridge the partisan divide in Washington. The party\u2019s voters are more evenly split on the scale of change they are seeking from their nominee: 49 percent said they preferred a candidate who would return politics in Washington to normal, while 45 percent hope for one who will bring fundamental change to American society. The poll showed a top tier of three candidates in the battleground states: Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. Mr. Biden was leading in five of the six states, while Ms. Warren enjoyed a narrow advantage within the margin of error in Wisconsin, where Mr. Sanders also appeared strong. No other candidate registered in double digits in any of the states surveyed. While Democrats have unambiguously moved to the left in the decade since President Barack Obama took office, as Republicans eagerly point out, the poll illustrates that the party\u2019s identity is more complex than the opposition and some progressive activists would portray it. Democratic voters in the six states, each of which Mr. Trump carried three years ago, are split almost equally in how they described themselves ideologically: 49 percent say they are moderate or conservative, while 48 percent indicate they are very liberal or somewhat liberal. And this presidential primary reflects the party\u2019s contrasting impulses. Primary voters who long for a moderate standard-bearer and a return to normalcy in Washington strongly prefer Mr. Biden, according to the survey. Those Democrats who prefer a progressive nominee and want them to fight for a bold agenda while bringing systemic change to American society are nearly evenly divided between Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren. The divisions go beyond ideology and ambition: Older, nonwhite Democrats and those without college degrees strongly favor Mr. Biden. But younger Democrats of all races prefer Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders, while those with college degrees overwhelmingly prefer Ms. Warren. None of the six states where voters were polled are casting ballots in the first stage of the primary next year, and only North Carolina votes on Super Tuesday, in early March, immediately after the initial early-voting states. So the candidate preferences could change by the time these states hold their nominating contests. The Times/Siena survey of 1,568 Democratic primary voters in the six states was conducted from Oct. 13 to 26. It has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2.8 percentage points. Sampling error in individual states is higher. In preferences for individual candidates, the major distinction between the six states and Iowa, where The Times and Siena polled caucusgoers late last month, is that Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., is in the top tier with Ms. Warren, Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders in Iowa. But he has scant support in the battleground states and despite winning a wave of attention in recent months, he was one of several candidates to poll at zero percent among black voters in those states. The ideological and generational divisions shaping this primary are strikingly similar in the Iowa and battleground surveys. Mr. Biden has nearly three times the support from voters over 65 that he does among those 29 and younger. And he does three times better among self-described moderates and conservatives than he does among those who say they are very liberal. The former vice president\u2019s support from older voters is especially pronounced among nonwhite Democrats. Nearly half of the racial minorities surveyed who were 45 and older backed Mr. Biden, while Mr. Sanders received 10 percent and Ms. Warren 9 percent. What\u2019s more ominous for Mr. Biden is that his support with younger nonwhite voters is far more tenuous: Among racial minorities under 45, Mr. Sanders was the favorite at 28 percent, followed by Ms. Warren at 19 percent and Mr. Biden at only 11 percent. Xiomara Alarcon, a 24-year-old postal worker from Greensboro, N.C., described Mr. Sanders as \u201cpure-hearted,\u201d a true-believing advocate for progressive policies like \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d She also approvingly noted that he was arrested as a young activist in 1963. \u201cHe fights for all people of color,\u201d said Ms. Alarcon, who identifies as Hispanic. \u201cNot just himself and his people.\u201d Among African-American voters of all ages in the six states, Mr. Biden was the overwhelming favorite, receiving 42 percent of that vote. Ms. Warren captured 13 percent, and Mr. Sanders had 10 percent. That finding aligns with other polling through the year that reinforces Mr. Biden\u2019s high standing with black voters, forged through ties with congressional and community leaders, and most significantly, through his relationship with former President Obama. \u201cHe was Obama\u2019s vice president and some of the things Obama supported, he supported,\u201d Michael Elliott, 61, of Jacksonville, Fla., said of Mr. Biden. \u201cVice president, that\u2019s as close as you can get to being a president. I\u2019m looking at experience, too.\u201d Nearly 300 miles down the Florida coast, William Stewart, 39, raised concerns about Mr. Biden\u2019s ability to appeal to younger voters and said he was currently supporting Ms. Warren. \u201cIt would be great for a woman to be president,\u201d said Mr. Stewart, of West Palm Beach. Mr. Stewart, a logistics manager, identifies as African-American. \u201cI believe in some of the thoughts she has about health care and equal rights for everybody.\u201d As for Mr. Biden, he said, \u201cI have a little reservation about if he\u2019s connecting with the younger people.\u201d Ms. Warren was strongest among voters who identified as \u201cvery liberal,\u201d winning 35 percent, while Mr. Biden captured just 13 percent of those voters. She also dominated with white college graduates, capturing 33 percent, far more than Mr. Biden or Mr. Sanders. Mr. Biden was strongest among white voters without a four-year degree, taking 30 percent \u2014 double Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders, who both captured 15 percent of these voters. \u201cJoe Biden has the experience,\u201d said Diane Ethridge, 60, of Green Bay, Wis. \u201cI also think he\u2019s more willing to listen and he will do far better with trade with this country, he will do far better, I think also even in the Democratic Party, with health care.\u201d Ms. Ethridge, who attended vocational school and worked at a phone company, said she opposed Medicare for all and efforts to make college free, proposals supported in various forms by Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders. \u201cShe\u2019s doing well in the polls,\u201d she said of Ms. Warren, \u201cbut I am not for her political platform of Medicare for all. I don\u2019t know where this money is going to be coming from. I am not in favor of education for all, either. I don\u2019t feel we should be paying for someone who could afford to pay for it.\u201d\n\nEven some of Ms. Warren\u2019s supporters expressed concerns about the practical and political considerations of her Medicare for all plan. Ms. Warren has said her proposal will not raise taxes on the middle class. Last Friday she unveiled a plan describing how she would pay for an initiative that she says would cost $20.5 trillion in new federal spending over a decade. \u201cI\u2019m very skeptical\u201d about the tax implications, Mr. Stewart, of Florida, said. \u201cThat\u2019s the only discrepancy. I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s possible.\u201d",

      "content": " CORALVILLE, Iowa \u2014 Bernie Sanders on Saturday unleashed his most forceful rebuke yet of Michael R. Bloomberg\u2019s potential presidential bid, warning the former mayor of New York that he would not be able to \u201cbuy this election\u201d and chastising his plan to skip campaigning in the early states. Speaking at a rally in Coralville, near the liberal home of the University of Iowa, Mr. Sanders, the senator from Vermont, repeatedly addressed Mr. Bloomberg by name, almost daring him to enter a Democratic primary race that has already been in progress for months. \u201cOur campaign is going to end the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality which exists in America today,\u201d said Mr. Sanders, who was joined by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a standard-bearer of the progressive left. \u201cSo tonight we say to Michael Bloomberg and other billionaires: Sorry, you ain\u2019t going to buy this election.\u201d He also derided Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s intended strategy of bypassing the key early voting states where so many of the current candidates are devoting time, money and resources. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to get elected president by avoiding Iowa, by avoiding New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to buy this election by spending hundreds of millions of dollars on media in California. Those days are gone.\u201d Mr. Bloomberg on Friday took the first step toward a candidacy, filing paperwork to qualify for the ballot in Alabama. His looming entry into the race has underscored its fluidity while presenting the threat of a centrist competitor to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. As a leading progressive, Mr. Sanders could potentially benefit from a Bloomberg candidacy that siphoned voters from Mr. Biden. But Mr. Sanders displayed no eagerness to see Mr. Bloomberg in the race, and was quick to draw a direct contrast between their efforts, saying his campaign had the grass-roots support to win rather than billions of dollars in the bank. \u201cBloomberg can have his billions,\u201d he said, \u201cbut that is why we are going to win this election.\u201d The rally was Mr. Sanders\u2019s second public event of the day with Ms. Ocasio-Cortez of New York, who joined him on Friday for a two-day swing through the first-in-the-nation caucus state. During a rally in Council Bluffs on Friday, both progressive politicians largely avoided making any references to Mr. Bloomberg. Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s early moves, and his suggestion that he would follow the unconventional campaign strategy of skipping all four traditional early-state contests and instead stake his candidacy on delegate-rich primary states like California and Texas, has supplied fresh fodder for candidates like Mr. Sanders and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who are both campaigning on anti-elitist, progressive messages. Earlier in the day on Saturday, at a climate change forum in Des Moines, Mr. Sanders directed a more glancing blow at Mr. Bloomberg, saying the country needed \u201ca dynamic democracy \u2014 a democracy where all of us play a role in shaping public policy, not some billionaire who decides that he wants to run for president of the United States because he\u2019s a billionaire.\u201d Mr. Sanders also took a shot at Mr. Biden, who recently said he would be willing to accept support from a super PAC; his campaign, Mr. Sanders said, had no such financial vehicle.",

Bloomberg is poised to enter a race that has many voters anxious and searching for the perfect candidate. But do they need yet one more option?By Sydney Ember and Jonathan MartinPRINT EDITIONBloomberg Nudges Into a Field Chock Full of Not-So-Sure Bets|November 10, 2019, Page A1",
      "author": "Sydney Ember",
      "content": "  COUNCIL BLUFFS, Iowa \u2014 Jackie Wellman worries that Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are too liberal to defeat President Trump, thinks Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., may be too inexperienced and, while she is fond of Joseph R. Biden Jr., she is also uneasy about his tendency to misspeak. \u201cI am worried about the top four candidates because they all have issues,\u201d said Ms. Wellman, a 54-year-old Iowa caucusgoer from West Des Moines who likes Senator Amy Klobuchar. Ms. Wellman is not the only Democrat who keeps finding flaws as she searches for the best candidate to win the White House. \u201cVoters are holding back because just when they start to fall in love, they find something that gets them a little nervous,\u201d former Mayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago said. \u201cThe reason it\u2019s so fluid is because they\u2019re still searching for the horse that can win.\u201d\n\nMichael R. Bloomberg believes that may be him. But Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s apparent decision to mount a late entry into the presidential race represents something more than just the robust self-confidence of a New York City billionaire; it\u2019s a manifestation of the Democratic angst that has been growing, particularly among moderate voters and party establishment figures. Mr. Bloomberg has jolted the Democratic primary, drawing fire from the leading liberals in the field who said he was trying to buy the presidency while posing a direct threat to the centrist candidacy of Mr. Biden. But he has also exposed the jitters among establishment-aligned Democrats who fear that the leftward turn of the party is endangering their chances of building a winning coalition.\n\nFor weeks, senior Democratic officials and donors have been musing about whether a new candidate could be lured in the race, a striking illustration of nervousness just three months before the Iowa caucuses. Some talked up Mr. Bloomberg and Hillary Clinton, but others wondered if Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio might make a late entry to unite a party splintered along ideological lines. And while some party leaders have muted their concerns in an effort to be neutral, that restraint has started to give way to open expressions of alarm. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has been repeating the same mantra \u2014 \u201cRemember November\u201d \u2014 in private about focusing on winning the general election, and has told Democratic allies she was uneasy about a nominee running on Medicare for all. In an interview last week with Bloomberg News, the San Francisco-based speaker let her concerns slip, saying that creating government-run health care \u201cwould increase the vote in my own district, but that\u2019s not what we need to do in order to win the Electoral College.\u201d Many voters are just as uneasy. \u201cI like Elizabeth Warren,\u201d said Janet Mayo-Smith, 64, who was attending an event for Mr. Biden in Franklin, N.H., on Friday, before adding that she had concerns about whether Ms. Warren was too \u201cradical\u201d to win. She expressed some openness to Mr. Bloomberg, calling him \u201ca good candidate\u201d but also noting that it was late to join the race. Stanley Brown, 49, also from New Hampshire,  called Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s move \u201cinteresting.\u2019\u2019 Asked if there were too many voices in the race already, he replied \u201cno such thing.\u2019\u2019 \u201cI\u2019d consider anybody,\u201d he said. Yet if there is consensus around the high priority of finding the strongest candidate to take on Mr. Trump, there is less agreement among rank-and-file voters that the party needs a white knight to enter the race and rescue them. Interviews with Democrats across four states on Friday showed that many were content to pick from those who remained in the sprawling field. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what his logic is exactly,\u201d Ricky Hurtado, who attended a Hispanic voters forum in North Carolina that featured Ms. Warren, said of Mr. Bloomberg. Ticking through a number of the leading Democrats in the race, Mr. Hurtado, who is running for the state legislature next year, said, \u201cI think we have enough voices in the primary right now covering the majority of the spectrum in the Democratic Party.\u201d In New Hampshire, where Mr. Biden and the businessman Andrew Yang were at the statehouse on a frosty day, filing paperwork to be on the state\u2019s primary ballot, voters mostly shrugged about Mr. Bloomberg, who on Friday filed paperwork to qualify for the Alabama primary. A few groused about a bloated field getting bigger. Carolyn Stiles, 75, said she worried that such a large field would make it difficult for Democrats to unify behind one candidate, and described Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s potential entrance into the race as \u201cunhelpful.\u201d She said she was considering Mr. Biden, Ms. Warren and Senator Kamala Harris. To some center-left Democratic candidates in the race, though, a Bloomberg bid could prove more than unhelpful. Were he to finance a major advertising campaign, he could siphon support, news media attention and ultimately votes from the more moderate candidates, clearing a path for Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren. \u201cI don\u2019t know who he hurts but it\u2019s not going to be Bernie or Elizabeth,\u201d said Senator Amy Klobuchar, who is hoping to establish herself in Iowa as a centrist alternative to Mr. Biden. \u201cWe don\u2019t need another billionaire,\u201d she added. Representative Cedric Richmond of Louisiana, a co-chair of Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign, was even blunter. \u201cIt takes a whole lot of moxie to look at the Democratic field and say, \u2018None of them can be president and I\u2019ll enter the race and be the savior,\u2019\u201d Mr. Richmond said. \u201cWhat does Bloomberg offer that\u2019s different? It\u2019s not like he\u2019s 27 \u2014 he\u2019s 77.\u201d Mr. Bloomberg may not prove to be the tonic the party is looking for. His record on policing and economic issues, and his skepticism about the #MeToo movement, could alienate large swaths of the Democratic electorate. And he is choosing an unconventional path in the primary; his advisers signaled Friday that if he runs he\u2019s unlikely to compete in the first four states. But it is clear enough why he is tempted to run. Mr. Biden\u2019s unsteady performances in debates and on the campaign trail have undermined confidence in his ability to beat the president. They have hurt Mr. Biden\u2019s fund-raising and early-state polling while exacerbating what may be his biggest liability \u2014 that at 76, he may not be nimble enough to beat an unpredictable figure like Mr. Trump. Mr. Buttigieg is gaining support in Iowa, but polls show he has yet to draw any sizable support from nonwhite Democrats. On the other flank of the party, Democrats are eyeing Mr. Sanders, a 78-year-old democratic socialist who just suffered a heart attack, and Ms. Warren, who is tightening her embrace around a pricey single-payer health care proposal that would terminate private insurance plans. Both candidates have large and devoted followings, but Democrats have not put forward avowedly liberal presidential nominees in decades; a new New York Times/Siena College poll showing Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders losing to Mr. Trump in some battleground states only further frayed nerves. \u201cThat frightened a lot of people,\u201d Terry McAuliffe, the former governor of Virginia and D.N.C. chair, said of the survey. Then came Tuesday\u2019s elections, in which Democrats had great success with mostly moderate candidates who posted large margins in suburban jurisdictions \u2014 heightening the conviction among many that the party needed a centrist standard-bearer. Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s prospective run has mostly agitated Mr. Biden\u2019s supporters, who were already on edge over his fund-raising troubles, his dip in the polls in Iowa and Mr. Trump\u2019s unrelenting assault on him and his son Hunter.\n\n \u201cI don\u2019t like that,\u201d Marge Cudney, who came to celebrate Mr. Biden\u2019s filing for the New Hampshire primary, said of Mr. Bloomberg. \u201cHe\u2019s going to divide the team and will weaken everybody. I think he could pull some people away.\u201d Yet two former lawmakers who are supporting Mr. Biden \u2014 Ed Rendell of Pennsylvania and Bob Kerrey, a former senator and governor of Nebraska \u2014 spoke favorably about Mr. Bloomberg and said they would be comfortable with him as a candidate if Mr. Biden faltered. \u201cI\u2019m for Joe,\u201d Mr. Rendell said, \u201cbut if something were to happen where Joe was no longer a candidate, which I don\u2019t believe is going to happen, I would enthusiastically consider the mayor as a good strong candidate, and I think he\u2019d make a fine president.\u201d And not every voter dismissed Mr. Bloomberg, whose advisers believe will be viewed more favorably once Democrats nationally become more familiar with his business career and record as mayor. Bryant Tolles, 80, of Concord, N.H., gave Mr. Bloomberg high marks for his political experience. \u201cI\u2019m glad he entered the race,\u201d said Mr. Tolles, who is undecided, adding, \u201cThey need another centrist who can appeal to the broad electorate.\u201d For all the heartburn in a party that is often given to indigestion about its presidential field, polls show that Democrats are generally pleased with their options. In a Monmouth University poll released this week, roughly three-quarters of Democratic voters said they were satisfied with the field, while just 16 percent said they were not. Moderate and conservative Democrats were more likely to say they wished someone new would get in the race, but only 22 percent of them expressed discontent with their choices. What is more revealing is how many in the party are not yet settled on a candidate: The Times/Siena poll of Iowa, where voters are paying closest attention to the race, found that roughly two-thirds of likely caucusgoers could still be persuaded to change their minds.\n\nThe ranks of the undecided include Alan Seabrooke, 89, of Elgin, Iowa, who said, \u201cIf you get somebody too far to the left, it scares people.\u201d Alex Stroda, a 40-year-old from Ottumwa, Iowa, who called himself a \u201cleftist libertarian,\u201d was just as concerned about 2020 but for the opposite reason: He thinks too many of the candidates are not progressive enough. Mr. Stroda, a former vice chair of the Wapello County Democrats, who is considering Mr. Sanders, Ms. Warren and Mr. Yang, dismissed the logic behind a Bloomberg candidacy. \u201cThis notion that he needs to ride in on a white horse and save the Democratic Party from somebody who is too left-wing,\u201d he said, \u201cis just an extension of the problem we have understanding politics in America, where we have the Democrats tacking to the right as the Republicans tack farther and farther right.\u201d",

      "content": " Joseph R. Biden Jr. unfurled sharply personal new lines of attack against Senator Elizabeth Warren on Tuesday, questioning her contributions to the Democratic Party and seeking to cast her as an elitist who believes people lack courage or wisdom unless they agree with her. \u201cSome call it the \u2018my way or the highway\u2019 approach to politics,\u201d Mr. Biden, the former vice president, wrote in a Medium post. \u201cBut it\u2019s worse than that. It\u2019s condescending to the millions of Democrats who have a different view. It\u2019s representative of an elitism that working and middle-class people do not share: \u2018We know best; you know nothing.\u2019 \u2018If you were only as smart as I am you would agree with me.\u2019 This is no way to get anything done.\u201d Mr. Biden repeated similar arguments in a fund-raising email and at a fund-raiser in Pittsburgh on Tuesday, escalating tensions between the two top-polling contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination. He did not mention his rival by name, but the message was unmistakably aimed at Ms. Warren, whose Republican critics have for years sought to paint her as an out-of-touch liberal who worked as a Harvard professor. Ms. Warren is running as a corruption-battling economic populist, and her campaign has emphasized that she grew up in Oklahoma \u201con the ragged edge of the middle-class.\u201d Her campaign declined to comment on Mr. Biden\u2019s remarks. Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren have clashed repeatedly over health care, especially as Ms. Warren has overtaken Mr. Biden in some early-state polls. Ms. Warren supports \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d an expansive government-run health insurance system that would all but eliminate private health insurance, while Mr. Biden wants to add a \u201cpublic option\u201d to build on the Affordable Care Act, but still allow people to choose private insurance. Last week, after Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign criticized Ms. Warren\u2019s proposal to pay for Medicare for all, she suggested that Mr. Biden was \u201crunning in the wrong presidential primary.\u201d \u201cDemocrats are not going to win by repeating Republican talking points and by dusting off the points of view of the giant insurance companies and the giant drug companies who don\u2019t want to see any change in the law that will bite into their profit,\u201d she said. Her message drew a pointed rebuke from Mr. Biden, who wrote that such remarks \u201creflect an angry unyielding viewpoint that has crept into our politics. If someone doesn\u2019t agree with you \u2014 it\u2019s not just that you disagree \u2014 that person must be a coward or corrupt or a small thinker.\u201d Some of Ms. Warren\u2019s other opponents, including Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., have also been critical of Ms. Warren\u2019s health care proposal, and of her approach to promoting it. In several venues on Tuesday, Mr. Biden also repeatedly seized on the fact that Ms. Warren was once a registered Republican, though she is now a leading progressive contender for the Democratic nomination and Mr. Biden is perceived by many on the left as too moderate and overly focused on striking deals with Republicans. \u201cI have fought for the Democratic Party my whole career,\u201d Mr. Biden wrote. \u201cI know what we stand for, who we stand with and what we believe. And it\u2019s not just policies or issues. It\u2019s in my bones. That\u2019s not something everyone in this primary can say.\u201d He was more explicit at the fund-raiser: \u201cI\u2019ve been a Democrat my whole life. This person has only fairly recently in the mid-\u201990s become a Democrat.\u201d Ms. Warren\u2019s team has in the past been critical of Mr. Biden\u2019s reliance on high-dollar fund-raising events. Mr. Biden and his allies often bristle at the suggestion that he is insufficiently progressive for this moment in the Democratic Party, and Mr. Biden on Tuesday sought to defend his liberal credentials on issues like health care and taxes. But his use of personal criticisms to confront Ms. Warren, the only woman polling in the top tier of Democratic contenders, carries risk. Attacks on character, including on Mr. Biden\u2019s, have often failed to land or have backfired in the primary process so far. Mr. Biden cast his remarks as self-defense. \u201cSince some have questioned whether I\u2019m running in the wrong primary \u2014 let me answer that question,\u201d he continued. \u201cI\u2019m running in the Democratic primary as a proud Democrat.\u201d",

      "author": "Carl Hulse",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Senate Republicans are conflicted about how quickly to move on an impeachment trial against President Trump, with some arguing for a speedy vote on the charges and others seeing an opportunity to drag out the historic proceedings and tie down some Democratic senators at a prime moment in their presidential campaigns. Republican senators say the split over how to approach what is likely to be the first presidential impeachment trial ever to unfold in an election year has been on vivid display in their private weekly lunches in the Capitol. Some senators argued last week that the articles of impeachment likely to emerge from the House later this year do not merit the slightest consideration, and should be quickly dispensed with, so as to limit the damage they could do to Mr. Trump and his party. Others mused with relish this week about the prospect of keeping the six Democratic presidential candidates who are sitting senators chained to their desks in the Capitol for weeks on end as crucial primary contests unfold. \u201cThere are lots of different opinions within the conference as to how long the impeachment in the Senate will take or should take, and those are different questions,\u201d said Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, the No. 3 Senate Republican. \u201cClearly there\u2019s not 51 votes for any one thing, so this is going to have to begin and then play out over time.\u201d Keeping anxious candidates stuck in Washington during campaign season, rather than out connecting with voters, is a tried-and-true political tactic in Congress. But the strict Senate rules for impeachment would take it to an extreme. Under Senate requirements for an impeachment trial, senators must sit attentively at their desks every afternoon except Sunday. That means they would not be able to flit in and out of Washington for occasional votes while spending most of their time campaigning in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, or on the phone raising money. Senators could choose to skip the proceedings, but then would likely have to contend with accusations they were shirking their constitutional responsibility. Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican and majority leader, was the first to raise the potential dilemma for the six presidential contestants \u2014 Senators Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kamala Harris of California, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Michael Bennet of Colorado, Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. \u201cThe question is how long does the Senate want to take,\u201d he told reporters last week. \u201cHow long do presidential candidates want to be here on the floor of the Senate, instead of in Iowa and New Hampshire and all of these other related issues that may be going on at the same time?\u201d Mr. McConnell may have been trying to drive home for Democrats the downsides of dragging out the trial, but he helped instigate a new school of thought \u2014 that Republicans could disrupt the Democratic primary by themselves prolonging the process. Senator Richard M. Burr, Republican of North Carolina, added fuel to the idea when he speculated aloud that a Senate trial could take six to eight weeks \u2014 longer than the five-week trial for President Bill Clinton in 1999. Mr. Burr told colleagues that he pulled the number out of the air based on his own experience as a member of the House during Mr. Clinton\u2019s impeachment, but his comments spurred senators to begin discussing among themselves the disadvantages for the Democrats. A prolonged trial could have implications for the president as well, allowing new information to emerge and potentially giving public credibility to the accusations against him. At the same time, close Republican allies of the president argue a speedy dismissal would convey to the public that the Democratic claims against him are groundless and unworthy of even the barest consideration. \u201cI think it\u2019s purely a partisan adventure right now by the Democrats, so I think the shorter the better,\u201d said Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky. \u201cI think we\u2019re having a debate over policy, not really over impeachable offenses. The sooner we can be done with it, the better.\u201d That approach has its own problems. It worries embattled Republican senators up for re-election who don\u2019t want to be seen by independent voters as unwilling to seriously consider that the president may have acted inappropriately. Mr. McConnell has also been cold to the idea of an immediate dismissal of the charges against Mr. Trump, telling colleagues that he believes the Senate must show that it is approaching an impeachment trial with solemnity and seriousness. Any hint that Republicans were focused mainly on sabotaging Democratic presidential candidates would undercut that effort. Mr. McConnell is also loath to force Republican members into any high-profile votes that show division among them, and a quick motion to dismiss probably would. \u201cI think it\u2019s impossible to predict how long we\u2019ll be on it or predict which motions would pass,\u201d Mr. McConnell said Wednesday as the first public impeachment hearing unfolded in the House. \u201cNo way to know.\u201d Republicans said the new focus on timing \u2014 and the implications for the Democratic presidential contenders \u2014 could have a positive benefit for both sides, serving to force senators to concentrate on just how they want the trial to develop as they move slowly toward bipartisan negotiations on ground rules for the trial. As for the presidential hopefuls in the Senate, most seem resigned to the idea that they will be forced to spend more time at their day jobs during a pivotal period in the race for their party\u2019s nomination. The first caucus, in Iowa, will be on Feb. 3. The trial could conceivably provide an advantage to top-tier candidates not in the Senate such as Pete Buttigieg and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., himself a former longtime senator, allowing them more time alone with early-state voters while their rivals sit quietly through an impeachment trial in Washington. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to see it this way, but if he\u2019s here in Iowa and six of his main competitors have to be in Washington, I think it\u2019s going to help him,\u201d said State Representative Bruce Hunter, an Iowa Democrat supporting Mr. Biden. But he was quick to note that many of Mr. Biden\u2019s opponents have strong field organizations, and that Iowa Democrats expect the senators to meet their obligations on Capitol Hill in a moment of national crisis. While being in Washington for an impeachment trial could afford endless cable news time for the six senators running for president, it would hinder their ability to push stories to early-state local news outlets, the sort of coverage campaigns prize in the run-up to the first nominating contests, officials with several 2020 campaigns said this week. Yet the senators and officials with their campaigns have said in recent days that they have an obligation to attend an impeachment trial of the president. \u201cWill your schedule change if there\u2019s an impeachment trial? Yes, yes,\u201d Ms. Klobuchar said earlier this month at a stop in Iowa. \u201cBut you see, I have the most endorsements of anyone from elected officials in the presidential race, so I have a lot of nice surrogates.\u201d Mr. Sanders, during an interview with ABC News that aired Sunday, said he would be forced to adjust his schedule to attend an impeachment trial. \u201cI guess I\u2019m just going to have to try to be in Washington, D.C., in Des Moines, Iowa, and Concord, N.H., at the same time,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cI will do my best.\u201d",

      "content": "  Less than two months ago, Michael R. Bloomberg told a PBS interviewer that he probably couldn\u2019t win a Democratic primary, and that entering the race as late as November would be \u201cpretty hard.\u201d Well, it\u2019s November now, and he seems to have changed his mind. Here\u2019s a look at what happened on the campaign trail this week. Mr. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, filed paperwork on Friday to put his name on the ballot for the Democratic primary in Alabama. According to his advisers, he has not definitively decided to run for president, but the paperwork was necessary to keep the possibility alive, because Friday was Alabama\u2019s filing deadline. Arkansas and New Hampshire have deadlines next week, and Team Bloomberg says it plans to meet those, too. If Mr. Bloomberg does enter the race, it will bring the Democratic field back to 18 candidates, the largest ever. For the past week or so, it was merely tied with the 2016 Republican field. Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s flirtation with running is part of a larger backlash to Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s continuing strength in the race \u2014 and a vote of no confidence in former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s ability to unite moderate Democrats against her. As she has cemented herself at or near the top of the polls, Ms. Warren has drawn particular vitriol from Wall Street, where some executives have already announced that they will support Mr. Bloomberg if he runs. In a Medium post this week, Mr. Biden cast Ms. Warren as an \u201celitist\u201d who takes a \u201c\u2018my way or the highway\u2019 approach to politics.\u201d And Leon Cooperman, the billionaire investor who complained recently about what he called Ms. Warren\u2019s \u201cvilification of the rich,\u201d endorsed Mr. Bloomberg. Thanks to six polls released since we last wrote, Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii has qualified for the next debate (Nov. 20), and Senators Kamala Harris of California and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota have qualified for the one after that (Dec. 19). That means 10 candidates are in for November, and six so far for December. We also learned this week that the December debate will no longer be held at the University of California, Los Angeles, because of a dispute between the university and its largest employee union. The union has called for a boycott of speaking engagements on campus. It will instead take place at Loyola Marymount University, also in Los Angeles. While President Trump\u2019s approval rating is very low, and he trails most of his potential Democratic challengers in national polls, he appears stronger in the states that will decide the election, according to a new set of polls from The New York Times and Siena College. In the six closest states that went Republican in 2016, he trails Mr. Biden among registered voters, but is deadlocked with Senator Bernie Sanders and leads Ms. Warren. Pat Murphy, the Iowa political director for Tom Steyer, resigned after reports that he had offered campaign contributions to local Iowa candidates if they endorsed Mr. Steyer. The campaign said no contributions had actually been made. \u201cOur campaign policy is clear that we will not engage in this kind of activity, or any kind of communication that could be perceived as improper,\u201d Mr. Steyer\u2019s campaign manager, Heather Hargreaves, said in a statement on Friday announcing Mr. Murphy\u2019s resignation. \u201cViolation of this policy is not tolerated.\u201d Mr. Sanders unveiled his immigration plan on Thursday, pledging to use executive action if Congress does not pass comprehensive legislation. He said that on the first day of his presidency, he would reverse President Trump\u2019s immigration policies, including the denial of asylum claims and the \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy that has led to family separations. He also vowed to halt all deportations \u201cuntil a thorough audit of current and past practices and policies is complete.\u201d More broadly, he called for ending deportations of people who have been in the United States for more than five years, creating a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, expanding the DACA program and making unauthorized immigration a civil, not criminal, offense. Ms. Warren has wholeheartedly embraced attacks from Wall Street, and on Thursday, she took it one step further: Her campaign released a \u201ccalculator for the billionaires.\u201d \u201cSome billionaires seem confused about how much they would pay under Elizabeth\u2019s Ultra-Millionaire Tax,\u201d it says. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, now we have a calculator for that too.\u201d",

      "author": "Lisa Lerer",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Former President Barack Obama offered an unusual warning to the Democratic primary field on Friday evening, cautioning the candidates not to move too far to the left in their policy proposals, even as he sought to reassure a party establishment worried about the electoral strength of their historically large primary field. Speaking before a room of wealthy liberal donors, Mr. Obama urged Democrats to remember the long, combative slog of his primary campaign against Hillary Clinton in 2008, arguing that the 16 month battle ultimately made him a stronger general election candidate. \u201cFor those who get stressed about robust primaries, I just have to remind you I had a very robust primary,\u201d he told the group of several hundred donors and organizational leaders in Washington. \u201cI\u2019m confident that at the end of the process we will have a candidate that has been tested.\u201d Yet, he also raised concerns about some of the liberal ideas being promoted by some candidates, citing health care and immigration as issues where the proposals may have gone further than public opinion. While Mr. Obama did not single out any specific primary candidate or policy proposal, he cautioned that the universe of voters that could support a Democratic candidate \u2014 Democrats, independents and moderate Republicans \u2014 are not driven by the same views reflected on \u201ccertain left-leaning Twitter feeds\u201d or \u201cthe activist wing of our party.\u201d \u201cEven as we push the envelope and we are bold in our vision we also have to be rooted in reality,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cThe average American doesn\u2019t think we have to completely tear down the system and remake it.\u201d The comments marked an extraordinary entrance into the primary contest by the former president, who has been careful to avoid even the appearance of influencing the direction of the race. His remarks offered an implicit critique of Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, who have urged voters to embrace \u201cpolitical revolution\u201d and \u201cbig, structural change,\u201d as well as proposals once widely considered to be left to the liberal fringes of the party, including court packing and decriminalizing illegal border crossings. Even as Mr. Obama has attempted to stay out of the race, the primary candidates have engaged in a heated discussion over his legacy, debating whether to stick with Mr. Obama\u2019s architecture for health care policy or to pursue a single-payer system and offering flashes of direct criticism over his record on immigration. At the same time, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has made his strong support for Mr. Obama and his accomplishments a hallmark of his candidacy. Acknowledging that candidates must \u201cpush past\u201d his achievements, Mr. Obama urged his party\u2019s candidates not to push too far, as he urged them to adopt a message that would allow them to compete in all corners of the country. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should be deluded into thinking that the resistance to certain approaches to things is simply because voters haven\u2019t heard a bold enough proposal and if they hear something as bold as possible then immediately that\u2019s going to activate them,\u201d he said. The fact that Mr. Obama offered his reassurances at the annual meeting of the Democracy Alliance, a club of wealthy liberals who donate hundreds of thousands of dollars a year to recommended political organizations, only underscored the intended audience of his message. In recent weeks, establishment-aligned Democrats, top donors and some strategists have expressed fears that the party lacks a strong enough candidate to defeat President Trump. They question whether Mr. Biden has the ability to compete in a multistate primary campaign, fret about Mr. Sanders\u2019s and Ms. Warren\u2019s viability in the general election and remain skeptical that Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., can broaden his appeal beyond white voters. Their concerns have prompted the late emergence of two experienced candidates, Deval Patrick, the former governor of Massachusetts and a close friend of Mr. Obama, and Michael R. Bloomberg, both of whom entered the field after nine candidates had already dropped out. Those worries are not necessarily shared by voters in early states, where surveys show that most Democrats have gravitated to a short list of four candidates and feel the field remains too large. \u201cIf you talk to the voters they don\u2019t feel the need for another candidate,\u201d said Kathy Sullivan, the former chairwoman of the Democratic Party in New Hampshire. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been sitting around in New Hampshire saying we need a hero to come and rescue us.\u201d Since leaving office nearly three years ago, the former president has mostly remained out of the public fray. While he\u2019s headlined fund-raising events for Democratic committees, the former president has kept a low profile in the presidential race, meeting privately with most of the Democratic candidates but telling friends and political allies that neither he nor his wife, Michelle, have plans to endorse anyone and do not see it as their place to steer the party\u2019s future. Mr. Obama has expressed interest, at different times, in rising stars like former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas and Mr. Buttigieg. Mr. Obama had issued a warm statement about Mr. Biden\u2019s entry into the primary but had declined to endorse him or anyone else. During his nearly hourlong remarks on Friday, Mr. Obama offered only one clear endorsement, though not exactly the one many Democratic donors in the room wanted to hear. Mr. Obama was interviewed by Stacey Abrams, who drew national attention during her unsuccessful run for governor of Georgia last year and is widely considered to be on the shortlist for the vice presidency \u2014 no matter which candidate ultimately wins the nomination. \u201cI love me some Stacey Abrams,\u201d he said.",

      "author": "Matt Flegenheimer",
      "content": "  Pete Buttigieg was trying a little tenderness. \u201cI\u2019m running to be the president for that day the sun comes up and the Trump presidency is behind us,\u201d said the millennial mayor of South Bend, Ind., pumping his left fist a bit for the crescendo, \u201cwhich will be a tender moment in the life of this country.\u201d Senator Kamala Harris had another impulse. By Wednesday evening, the nation\u2019s foremost political drama had been confined to the capital, where marathon impeachment proceedings into President Trump have siphoned oxygen from the Democratic primary less than three months before the voting begins. Onstage in Atlanta, Mr. Trump\u2019s leading challengers had been asked a thorny political question: How do you run a campaign in impeachment\u2019s long shadow? \u201cWe have a criminal living in the White House,\u201d Ms. Harris said, nodding grimly before appearing to tweak Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s rosy view. \u201cAnd there is no question that in 2020, the biggest issue before us, until we get to that tender moment, is justice is on the ballot.\u201d The candidates\u2019 divergent messages laid bare a central tension in this Democratic primary: finding a way to stand out when the sitting president, tweeting and rampaging through impeachment, tends to edge into the frame whether or not he is in the room. With Democratic voters desperate to defeat a man they view as a singular threat, much of the primary has turned on the difficult-to-define question of electability \u2014 on who can take the fight most powerfully to Mr. Trump, how much emphasis that should earn in what is ostensibly an intraparty battle of ideas and who can piece together the most formidable coalition next fall. On Wednesday, several of the candidates embraced the kind of meta-punditry that voters have often demanded, sketching out their paths to victory in detail. Senator Amy Klobuchar and Mr. Buttigieg highlighted their Midwestern credentials, with Ms. Klobuchar noting her strength in \u201cred and purple\u201d congressional districts in her home state of Minnesota. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who has premised much of his candidacy on the idea that he stands the best chance against Mr. Trump, suggested that he was uniquely positioned not only to defeat Mr. Trump but also to help Democrats expand their ranks on Capitol Hill. But the most pointed argument came from Ms. Harris, perhaps alluding again to Mr. Buttigieg, who has glided to the top of early-state polls but still struggles mightily with voters of color, the bedrock of the party. \u201cWe need someone on that stage who has the ability to go toe to toe with Donald Trump,\u201d Ms. Harris said, \u201cand someone who has the ability to rebuild the Obama coalition.\u201d Mr. Buttigieg, playing to his biographical strengths, suggested the more useful electoral background was his own. \u201cWe need somebody who can go toe to toe who actually comes from the kinds of communities that he\u2019s been appealing to,\u201d Mr. Buttigieg said, nodding to Mr. Trump\u2019s popularity in parts of the industrial Midwest. \u201cI don\u2019t talk a big game about helping the working class while helicoptering between golf courses with my name on them. I don\u2019t even golf.\u201d Left unsaid on Wednesday, at a debate held in a large majority-black city, was that in a party that has long prided itself on its diversity, the top four candidates at present \u2014 Mr. Biden, Mr. Buttigieg, Senator Elizabeth Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders \u2014 are all white. Ms. Harris and Cory Booker, two black senators once seen as major contenders, have flagged in the polls. Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former federal housing secretary and the only Latino in the race, did not qualify for this debate. \u201cFor too long, I think, candidates have taken for granted constituencies that have been the backbone of the Democratic Party,\u201d Ms. Harris said a short while later, punctuating a forceful night. \u201cWhen it\u2019s close to election time, they show up at a black church.\u201d She spoke twice more about \u201cthe Obama coalition.\u201d \u201cI keep referring to that because that\u2019s the last time we won,\u201d she said. Mr. Buttigieg said he welcomed \u201cthe challenge of connecting with black voters in America who don\u2019t yet know me,\u201d noting that he runs a city \u201cthat is racially diverse and largely low-income\u201d and reflecting on his own experience with discrimination as a gay man. Mr. Biden, who in polls currently has a commanding lead with African-American voters, sought to emphasize his own credibility with that demographic \u2014 but he overlooked Ms. Harris, a black senator, in the process. \u201cI\u2019m part of that Obama coalition,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cI come out of the black community in terms of my support. If you notice, I have more people supporting me in the black community that have announced for me because they know me, they know who I am. Three former chairs of the black caucus, the only African-American woman that had ever been elected to the United States Senate \u2014\u201d Mr. Booker and Ms. Harris objected as the California senator, laughing, raised her arms in amusement. Mr. Biden clarified that he meant to say \u2014 or perhaps thought he said \u2014 the first African-American woman elected to the Senate, not the only one. As with past debates, a truism of presidential politics seemed to hold: Combat is the sincerest form of flattery. When Mr. Biden was dominating the polls early in the primary, debate nights devolved frequently into a stage-wide game of whack-a-veep. Last month, after Ms. Warren seemed to be overtaking him, she took her turn absorbing attacks. By evening\u2019s end on Wednesday, Mr. Buttigieg, who is leading in Iowa in the latest poll from The Des Moines Register and CNN, had reason to feel reasonably flattered. Ms. Klobuchar expressed her \u201cappreciation,\u201d a bit dismissively, for his work \u201cas a local official.\u201d Representative Tulsi Gabbard, who has delighted this year in criticizing other Democrats, called one of Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s recent comments about foreign policy \u201ccareless.\u201d Mr. Booker, joking of his \u201clifetime of experience with black voters\u201d as a black voter himself, seemed to have Mr. Buttigieg in mind when he said, \u201cNo one on this stage should need a focus group to hear from African-American voters.\u201d The former vice president was less eager to confront Mr. Buttigieg directly, even as the mayor seeks to emerge as a younger moderate alternative for voters alarmed at Mr. Biden\u2019s uneven performances. Mr. Biden stumbled on Wednesday as he sought to discuss one of his signature issues: health care. He intends to give Americans the option to maintain their private health insurance \u2014 but he initially contradicted himself. \u201cWe should build on Obamacare, provide the plan I put forward before anybody in here, adding a Medicare option in that plan and not make people choose \u2014 allow people to choose, I should say,\u201d he said. Mr. Biden, a former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was smoother when discussing foreign policy. And one of his strongest moments in the debate came when he said he would defer to his Justice Department on whether Mr. Trump should face a potential criminal investigation after he leaves office. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea that we model ourselves after Trump and say, \u2018lock him up,\u2019\u201d Mr. Biden said. Other flourishes were less elegant. At one point, he seemed to suggest that violence against women could be addressed by \u201cpunching\u201d it. \u201cNo man has a right to raise a hand to a woman in anger other than in self-defense, and that rarely ever occurs,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cSo we have to just change the culture, period, and keep punching at it and punching at it.\u201d It was probably always going to be an unusual evening. Even unmemorable debates generally monopolize the nation\u2019s political attention for at least a couple of hours. But on Wednesday, the day\u2019s chief political moment had plainly already happened, in Washington, by the time the candidates took the stage. More bizarre still, the debate did not feature the two would-be contenders whose renewed interest in the 2020 race has shadowed the primary recently: former Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts, who entered the contest last week, and former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York, who could follow him soon. Yet for all the candidates onstage \u2014 whether fighting for relevance, qualification for future debates or a polling lead \u2014 the forum supplied a crucial opportunity for airtime, and to test out new jokes or dust off old material. Ms. Klobuchar had a chance to deploy a well-practiced bit: \u201cMy first Senate race I literally called everyone I knew and I raised $17,000 from ex-boyfriends,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019d like to point out it is not an expanding base.\u201d Mr. Sanders jumped on the subject of Medicare for all with his catchphrase: \u201cI wrote the damn bill.\u201d When asked, Mr. Yang said that as president, his first comment to Russian leader Vladimir V. Putin would be, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I beat your guy.\u201d Mr. Booker laced into Mr. Biden\u2019s recently expressed reservations about legalizing  marijuana. \u201cI thought you might have been high when you said it,\u201d Mr. Booker said. Mr. Biden wobbled a bit behind his lectern, smirking. Yet in his closing remarks, Mr. Booker reminded viewers of a curious truth: He has not yet qualified for next month\u2019s debate.",

      "author": "Lisa Lerer",
      "content": " Hi, and welcome to a special post-debate edition of On Politics. I\u2019m Lisa Lerer, your host. Yesterday afternoon, when our benevolent politics editor Patrick Healy asked what I expected to hear at the debate last night, I shot back full of confidence and that classic political reporter swagger. Pile on Pete. Duh. The question, I argued, wasn\u2019t whether the candidates would go after Pete Buttigieg but how he\u2019d deal with the flood of attacks on his policies, lack of experience and inability to win over voters of color. Well, dear readers, revoke my conventional wisdom card right now. I was wrong. Really wrong. Last night\u2019s debate was notable more for what didn\u2019t happen that what did: The South Bend mayor skated. Coming into the debate, there were several leading candidates who needed to do something to try to slow Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s momentum. Others, like Senators Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey, could have benefited from taking a shot at a top-tier candidate, particularly one who has struggled to connect with black voters. No one did anything to stop his rise. Sure, there were a handful of attacks. Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii went after Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s record on foreign policy, a charge he deflected by launching into a broadside on Ms. Gabbard\u2019s much-derided meeting with the President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, a \u201cmurderous dictator.\u201d Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota went after Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s background, questioning whether his experience as mayor of South Bend, Ind., \u2014 a city of about 100,000 people \u2014 makes him ready for the White House. \u201cThere\u2019s more than 100 years of Washington experience on this stage, and where are we right now as a country?\u201d Mr. Buttigieg fired back. And Ms. Harris, who has continued her slide in the polls, whiffed her attack over his campaign website\u2019s use of a stock photo from Kenya to illustrate his plan to combat racism in the United States. Mr. Buttigieg responded by talking about his history leading a \u201cracially diverse city\u201d and as a gay man. Of course, a good night hardly means Mr. Buttigieg is unstoppable. His weakness with voters of color, which is evident in tons of polls, is a real problem. No Democrat in recent political history has won the party\u2019s presidential nomination without the support of black voters. But Mr. Buttigieg, who has opened a lead in Iowa in recent polling, is hoping a victory there can help him win over skeptical voters in the more diverse primaries that follow. There\u2019s no indication anyone on that stage last night took steps to sow the kinds of doubts that would stop him from moving forward with his plan. Or his momentum. Plenty of other stuff happened last night, too! Here\u2019s some of what we were watching. The candidates touched on a number of topics that hadn\u2019t really been explored in the past four debates: paid family leave, affordable housing and the potential cost of deconstructing President Trump\u2019s border wall, to name a few. But none led to sharp exchanges, as the candidates favored quippy one-liners over sustained attacks. With little conflict to help distinguish the candidates on a number of issues, the consensus among my colleagues was that the debate was, well, boring. Nearly all the previous debates revolved around Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren and their health care plans. This time, they were mostly relegated to background players on the stage. While both had brief moments, neither lodged a particularly memorable line. And health care, for the first time in five rounds of debates, didn\u2019t dominate the discussion. When asked about the Me Too movement, former Vice President Joe Biden said that Americans just have to keep \u201cpunching at it, and punching at it, and punching at it\u201d to change the culture of violence against women. \u201cI come out of the black community,\u201d Mr. Biden said, perplexingly, at a later point. And at least one of his flubs prompted incredulous cross talk from others on the stage, when he suggested that only one black woman had been elected to the Senate. Ms. Harris, who was standing two lecterns over, is the second. While those comments will rile up those who oppose him, they seem unlikely to seriously shake his strong support among black voters. The Hawaii congresswoman took more incoming fire than in any previous debate, as rivals painted her as a closet Republican and a conservative media darling who loves nothing more than attacking the Democratic Party she aims to lead. Analysis of her support shows that she draws more from conservatives and Republicans than any other candidate, so it\u2019s unclear whether this will hurt her modest standing in the race.

You know, following the financial crash of 2008, I had an idea for a consumer agency that would keep giant banks from cheating people. And all of the Washington insiders and strategic geniuses said, don\u2019t even try because you will never get it passed. And sure enough, the big banks fought us. The Republicans fought us. Some of the Democrats fought us. But we got that agency passed into law. It has now forced big banks to return more than $12 billion directly to people they cheated. I served in the Obama administration. I know what we can do by executive authority, and I will use it. In Congress, on the first day, I will pass my anti-corruption bill, which will beat back the influence of money. ANDERSON COOPER: Thank you, Senator. WARREN: And repeal the filibuster. And the third, we want to get something done in America, we have to get out there and fight. COOPER: Thank you, Senator. WARREN: For the things that touch people\u2019s live. BIDEN: I agree. Let me \u2014 she referenced me. I agreed with the great job she did, and I went on the floor and got you votes. I got votes for that bill. I convinced people to vote for it, so let\u2019s get those things straight too. [Applause] COOPER: Senator Warren, do you want to respond? WARREN: I am deeply grateful to President Obama, who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law, and I am deeply grateful to every single person who fought for it and who helped pass it into law. But understand \u2014 BIDEN: You did a hell of a job in your job. WARREN: Thank you. (Applause) But understand this. It was a dream big, fight hard. People told me, go for something little. Go for something small. Go for something that the big corporations will be able to accept. COOPER: Thank you, senator. WARREN: I said, no. Let\u2019s go for an agency that will make structural change in our economy. And President Obama said, I will fight for that, and he sometimes had to fight against people in his own administration. We have \u2014 BIDEN: Not me. WARREN: Good. We have to be able to make big, structural change.",

Her policy vision smacks of an \u201cacademic exercise.\u201d Her advocacy style is \u201cmy way or the highway,\u201d and she has displayed an \u201celitist attitude.\u201d In ways overt and subtle, Joseph R. Biden Jr., his campaign and his allies have begun mounting personal attacks on his most formidable rival in the 2020 primary race, portraying her as embracing a rigid, condescending approach that befits a former Harvard professor with an ambitious policy agenda. It is a politically risky case to make against a leading female candidate, especially to a Democratic primary electorate that has so far signaled little appetite for intraparty warfare. Women historically make up a majority of Democratic primary voters, and for many, memories of attacks against Hillary Clinton in 2016 are still fresh. The aggressive approach is also new territory for Mr. Biden, the former vice president who served for decades as a decorous senator and typically tempers rebukes of opponents with mentions of their good character. Ms. Warren, who generally refrains from sparring with her rivals, has started to push back, denouncing criticism from \u201cpowerful men\u201d who try to tell women how to behave. The back-and-forth between the two candidates signals the start of a more combative phase of the 2020 race, with their jousting largely focused on Ms. Warren\u2019s $20.5 trillion plan to pay for a sweeping \u201cMedicare for all\u201d program. Democratic pushback against that plan has buoyed Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign, which is keenly aware of Ms. Warren\u2019s political momentum in key states like Iowa, where the first nominating contest will be held in less than three months. After the Biden team dismissed her Medicare for all plan, Ms. Warren suggested critics were embracing Republican talking points and even running in the wrong party \u2014 remarks that Mr. Biden found personally galling, advisers and allies said. He responded in a toughly worded statement and in a fund-raising appeal on Tuesday, casting Ms. Warren\u2019s response as \u201ccondescending,\u201d reflective of an \u201cangry unyielding viewpoint\u201d and \u201crepresentative of an elitism that working- and middle-class people do not share.\u201d He repeated versions of that argument in a radio interview and at fund-raisers throughout the week, decrying Ms. Warren\u2019s \u201cattitude\u201d in a way that struck some voters and political operatives as sexist, and others as ironic, given that he sometimes made this populist argument at his own events with big donors. On Friday, Mr. Biden told reporters at New Hampshire\u2019s State House here that \u201cthe next president of the United States is going to have to make sure that they\u2019re able to get things done, pass things.\u201d He added, \u201cGoing after people\u2019s motives or instructing them on what they should believe is not the way that you get things done.\u201d Ms. Warren, who caught up to or surpassed Mr. Biden in some polls this fall and now faces the scrutiny that comes with being a leading candidate, fired back on Friday, sending a fund-raising email with the subject line, \u201cI am angry and I own it.\u201d \u201cOver and over, we are told that women are not allowed to be angry,\u201d Ms. Warren wrote in the message, which did not mention Mr. Biden. \u201cIt makes us unattractive to powerful men who want us to be quiet.\u201d She added: \u201cWell, I am angry and I own it. I\u2019m angry on behalf of everyone who is hurt by Trump\u2019s government, our rigged economy, and business as usual.\u201d Asked on Saturday if she thought Mr. Biden would describe her as angry and condescending if she were a man, Ms. Warren replied, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask him that?\u201d The confrontation between the two leading candidates reflects the unsettled nature of the Democratic primary race, where Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren are now squaring off as the two leading candidates while she is also playing both offense and defense on Medicare for all. But just as apparent are the gender dynamics and dangers in personal attacks for a Democratic field that began with a record number of female candidates but is now dominated by three white men \u2014 Mr. Biden, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. \u2014 and Ms. Warren, of Massachusetts. Mr. Biden\u2019s attacks, in effect if not intent, include descriptions that some voters and researchers on women and politics see as sexist tropes about female politicians: portraying them as overbearing, schoolmarmish or different from the norm. \u201cThe question is whether Biden would use the same words to describe a male professor \u2014 and I suspect he would,\u201d said Gloria Steinem, the feminist leader. \u201cThe larger problem is that they\u2019re about style, not content.\u201d His criticism of Ms. Warren troubled some voters who came to see her on the campaign trail over the weekend. \u201cI think it\u2019s sexist,\u201d Savannah Johnson, 49, a social worker who supports Ms. Warren and who attended a town hall she held in Goose Creek, S.C., on Saturday, said of Mr. Biden\u2019s criticism. \u201cI just don\u2019t think that he\u2019d be saying the same thing about a male candidate,\u201d she added. \u201cI think that all strong women kind of get labeled that unfairly.\u201d Niamh Cahill, 21, a college student who also came to the town hall, said Ms. Warren would not be getting as much grief if she were a male candidate. \u201cYeah, she\u2019s fired up, she\u2019s angry, but for a good reason,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are a lot of things that are wrong in this country.\u201d Mr. Biden often discusses his record of advocacy for women\u2019s rights by citing his championing of the Violence Against Women Act and his work combating campus sexual assault. And none of his remarks have come close to the audaciously sexist language and tactics that President Trump used against female political opponents like Mrs. Clinton and Carly Fiorina in the 2016 campaign or his offensive and demeaning language about Megyn Kelly, Stormy Daniels and the women he referenced in his taped interview with \u201cAccess Hollywood.\u201d Mr. Biden said in a CNN interview that his criticisms of Ms. Warren had \u201cnothing to do with\u201d gender. He and his allies said he was focused on debating the merits of policy and approaches to leading and governing. \u201cAs an African-American woman who serves as mayor of Atlanta, I know what sexism and racism looks and feels like and I don\u2019t see it here,\u201d said Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, who has endorsed Mr. Biden. \u201cWhen people propose these great plans, how will they be paid for? I think people expect to have real answers to that. And I think to the extent that you\u2019re touting plans I think you need to be prepared to explain it and not create distractions.\u201d Still, for Ms. Warren, being called elitist is squarely at odds with how she introduces herself to voters. She often discusses growing up in Oklahoma on the \u201cragged edge of the middle class\u201d and is running for president as a corruption-fighting populist. Mr. Biden\u2019s words conjured Ms. Warren\u2019s career as a Harvard law professor \u2014 a title that could unsettle voters without college degrees, a demographic with which Mr. Biden is currently strong, polls show. On the campaign trail, Ms. Warren talks about her time as a law professor but does not draw attention to her affiliation with Harvard, and she notes in her stump speech that she went to a public law school (she attended Rutgers). On Friday, Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign issued a news release slamming her Medicare for all proposal as unrealistic, arguing, \u201cbeing president isn\u2019t an academic exercise.\u201d The message reminded some Democrats of how Scott Brown, the incumbent in the 2012 Massachusetts Senate race, unsuccessfully sought to caricature Ms. Warren as an out-of-touch professor. \u201cI don\u2019t think it will work for the Biden team, either, because first of all, her personal story is the antithesis of anything elitist,\u201d said Mary Anne Marsh, a Boston-based Democratic strategist unaligned in the presidential primary, though some of her colleagues have worked on Ms. Warren\u2019s prior races. \u201cShe\u2019s done a very, very good job consistently defining her life story.\u201d Mr. Biden is hardly dismissing Ms. Warren as a \u201cprofessor.\u201d And his campaign noted that he had used words like \u201celitist\u201d and \u201cangry\u201d to describe Republican men before. His allies are also trying to tap into increasingly vocal pushback against Medicare for all and its potential political consequences from Democrats in 2020 battleground states; House Speaker Nancy Pelosi also recently warned that such a plan, and its elimination of private health insurance, carries significant political risk. And he is plainly uncomfortable repeating in person the fierce criticism about Ms. Warren\u2019s \u201ccondescending\u201d style that he issued in his Tuesday statement. Asked directly if he felt Ms. Warren was out of touch, he replied to reporters, \u201cI\u2019m not saying she\u2019s out of touch. What I\u2019m saying is, the way to approach politics today to get things done is not to question people\u2019s motives.\u201d \u201cI wasn\u2019t referring to Elizabeth Warren as being elitist,\u201d Mr. Biden insisted at another point during an exchange with reporters here. \u201cI said the American people out there, they understand what\u2019s going on, and they don\u2019t like being instructed on what they should believe and what they don\u2019t believe.\u201d In big primary fields, attackers can often damage their opponent \u2014 but hurt themselves in the process. That has been the case for multiple Democratic contenders who have swung at Mr. Biden in personal terms, only to face blowback. For Mr. Biden now, the risk is especially great because he is seen by many voters as a warm and gracious figure in the party \u2014 and harsh attacks could seem out of character. Still, for some voters, the clash between Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren was illuminating more than worrisome. \u201cI like that it\u2019s personal,\u201d said Stanley Brown, 49, of Tilton, N.H., who attended a Biden event on Friday and is considering Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren along with several other candidates. \u201cThey care. It\u2019s not just a canned answer.\u201d",

      "content": " INDIANOLA, Iowa \u2014 Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said on Sunday that she would release a plan to finance \u201cMedicare for all\u201d in the coming weeks, bowing to critics who have pressed her to explain how she would pay for a single-payer health care system. Ms. Warren has become known for her towering stack of policy plans, having offered dozens of proposals on a wide variety of subjects. But on health care, she has not been similarly forthcoming, and her repeated refusal to say whether she would raise taxes on the middle class to help finance Medicare for all has drawn sharp criticism from some of her Democratic presidential rivals. Given her increasing status as a front-runner in the primary race, Ms. Warren was certain to continue facing challenges on the issue. For weeks, she has sidestepped questions about raising taxes, no matter who was asking and when. But it had been an open question whether it would remain politically tenable for her to continue simply aligning herself with Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019s health care plan while declining to provide any detailed explanation of how she would pay for it. Ms. Warren brought up the issue of Medicare for all at the end of a town-hall-style event in Iowa on Sunday afternoon. \u201cI plan over the next few weeks to put out a plan that talks about, specifically, the cost of Medicare for all and, specifically, how we pay for it,\u201d she told the crowd at the event, held at Simpson College. \u201cThis is something I\u2019ve been working on for months and months, and it\u2019s got just a little more work until it\u2019s finished,\u201d Ms. Warren added. Speaking to reporters afterward, Ms. Warren did not directly answer when asked whether her financing plan would include taxes on the middle class. Ms. Warren\u2019s repeated refusal to explicitly say whether she would raise taxes on the middle class to help fund Medicare for all has stood in stark contrast to how she has talked about other policy areas \u2014 providing lengthy, detailed plans and explaining how she would create a tax on the wealth of the richest Americans to finance major proposals like student debt cancellation and universal child care. On the subject of health care, Ms. Warren has locked arms with Mr. Sanders, of Vermont, declaring on the debate stage in June, \u201cI\u2019m with Bernie on Medicare for all.\u201d But unlike Ms. Warren, Mr. Sanders has openly said that taxes would increase for the middle class. Mr. Sanders\u2019s plan would eliminate health insurance premiums and almost all out-of-pocket costs. But he would compensate by raising taxes, and his financing ideas include a payroll tax that would affect many middle-class Americans. Assessing the overall effects on individual Americans is not possible under his plan, because he has not been specific about the particular tax increases he would use. \u201cFor virtually everybody,\u201d Mr. Sanders said at last week\u2019s debate, \u201cthe tax increase they pay will be substantially less \u2014 substantially less than what they were paying for premiums and out-of-pocket expenses.\u201d Ms. Warren has sought to reframe the question of raising taxes around the total costs that families would face under Medicare for all. She has said that costs would go up for wealthy people and big corporations, but would go down for middle-class families. \u201cI will not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle-class families,\u201d Ms. Warren said at the debate, a pledge she repeated in Iowa on Sunday. The campaign of one of Ms. Warren\u2019s top rivals, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., noted on Sunday that Ms. Warren committed to releasing a financing plan only after being pushed on the issue. \u201cIt\u2019s mystifying that for someone who has put having a plan for everything at the center of her pitch to voters, Senator Warren has decided to release a health care plan only after enduring immense public pressure for refusing to do so,\u201d a spokesman for the Biden campaign, T.J. Ducklo, said. He added that the Biden campaign hoped Ms. Warren\u2019s plan \u201cwill be straight with the American people about how much middle-class taxes will go up.\u201d When told that Ms. Warren said she would soon release a plan for financing Medicare for all, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., replied: \u201cOh good. Well, she should.\u201d And Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota offered a skeptical take about the coming plan. \u201cI think if she had a good answer, we would have seen it by now,\u201d she told reporters. \u201cBut I look forward to seeing it.\u201d Ms. Warren\u2019s lack of specificity on paying for Medicare for all \u2014 and her consistent refusal to directly answer the question about raising taxes \u2014 has offered an opening for her opponents to criticize her. Last month, Mr. Buttigieg called Ms. Warren \u201cextremely evasive\u201d on the subject, and at last week\u2019s debate he pressed the point further, after Ms. Warren again avoided saying whether she would raise taxes on the middle class. \u201cWe need to see how this is going to be paid for,\u201d he said on Sunday on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d before Ms. Warren made her announcement, \u201cbecause, right now, whether you copy-paste the Bernie Sanders math or do it some other way, there is a hole amounting to trillions of dollars in how this is supposed to work.\u201d Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign had previously said that she was reviewing \u201crevenue options\u201d for Medicare for all. Ms. Warren did not provide details on Sunday about the contents of her forthcoming financing plan, and she noted that cost estimates for Medicare for all vary by trillions of dollars. \u201cThe different revenue streams for how to fund it, there are a lot of them,\u201d she said.",

      "content": "  The Democratic presidential candidates yielded to the furor surrounding the impeachment inquiry in Washington in their primary debate on Wednesday, for the first time training their fire more steadily on President Trump than on one another and presenting a largely united front on vital issues like climate change and abortion rights. One month after the party\u2019s moderate wing led a ferocious attack against Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts at the previous debate, the leading Democrats opted to mute their rivalries and restrain their language, mainly detailing their disagreements in gentle or at most passive-aggressive terms. There were moments of direct friction, especially in the final minutes of the debate over matters of national security, but in many cases the candidates\u2019 criticism was couched within jocular one-liners or pragmatic arguments about electability. Most telling were a handful of sharper exchanges among the 10 candidates onstage in Atlanta related to matters of race and gender. Several expressed concerns about the prospect of nominating a white man, like former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. or Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. Senators Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of California both warned that the party could not afford to select a candidate who was not capable of exciting African-American voters, and Ms. Harris repeatedly invoked \u201cthe Obama coalition\u201d as the Democrats\u2019 best hope for electoral success. \u201cBlack voters are pissed off and they\u2019re worried,\u201d Mr. Booker said, lamenting that too many African-American voters hear from Democratic candidates only during election season. He also rebuked Mr. Biden for expressing resistance last weekend to legalizing marijuana, joking, \u201cI thought you might have been high when you said it.\u201d Mr. Buttigieg and Mr. Biden both insisted they were capable of marshaling support from minority voters. Mr. Buttigieg acknowledged that he faced \u201cthe challenge of connecting with black voters\u201d who do not know him yet, and Mr. Biden argued that his present strength with African-American primary voters spoke for itself. \u201cI was part of that coalition,\u201d he said, even adding: \u201cI come out of the black community.\u201d As for the Obama coalition, Mr. Biden once again referred to his personal bond with the former president: \u201cI was part of that coalition,\u201d he said. It was widely anticipated that Mr. Buttigieg would become a kind of political pin cushion onstage, as other Democrats sought to harry him as the emerging front-runner in Iowa. But it was only in the final moments of the debate that he drew sustained criticism, first from Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and then, more caustically, from Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii. But it was unclear whether anyone raised new doubts about the young mayor as a contender for the nation\u2019s most powerful office. Ms. Klobuchar noted that Mr. Buttigieg, 37, had lost his only statewide election, and lacked a governing record on issues, like voting rights, that he talked about on the campaign trail.  \u201cI think experience should matter,\u201d she said. But Mr. Buttigieg, using a recurring tactic of deflection, dismissed the value of experience in Washington and cited his service in the military. Ms. Gabbard was a more persistent adversary, rebuking Mr. Buttigieg for saying in a recent interview that he might be willing to deploy American troops in Mexico to fight violence there. Mr. Buttigieg again held his ground, calling Ms. Gabbard\u2019s characterization of his remarks \u201coutlandish\u201d and chiding her for having met with the \u201cmurderous dictator\u201d Bashar al-Assad during a trip to Syria. But for the most part, the Democrats focused on denouncing Mr. Trump. That was in part because, unlike at previous debates, the moderators avoided stoking rivalries and highlighting differences. Yet the lack of vitriol and the intense focus on electability also owed to the nature of this campaign, which as the impeachment inquiry unfolds is becoming even more centered on finding the best candidate to defeat the president. The candidates attacked Mr. Trump both for his actions toward Ukraine that have prompted impeachment proceedings and for a longer litany of offenses, including his detention of children at the Mexican border, his warm relationships with dictatorial governments in Saudi Arabia and North Korea and his appointment of political cronies to prominent jobs. The debate also highlighted the considerable areas of agreement across the Democratic field on overarching policy goals, including taking aggressive action to counter climate change, expanding voting rights and restoring traditional American alliances around the world. Ms. Warren used the impeachment inquiry, and the testimony on Wednesday by Gordon D. Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union and a Trump donor, to criticize the practice of installing wealthy political supporters in overseas embassies. Mr. Booker railed against Mr. Trump for what he described as his human rights violations at the southern border, such as \u201cwhen children are thrown in cages.\u201d Ms. Harris jabbed that Mr. Trump \u201cgot punked\u201d by Kim Jong-un, the North Korean dictator, in nuclear negotiations. For Ms. Klobuchar, it was Mr. Trump\u2019s forgiving treatment of Saudi Arabia after its agents kidnapped and killed the journalist Jamal Khashoggi. \u201cThat sent a signal to dictators around the world that that\u2019s O.K.,\u201d Ms. Klobuchar said. Still, if there were no heated moments likely to endure past the evening, as there had been in past debates, there were fault lines within the field, separating the most progressive candidates, like Ms. Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, from comparatively moderate figures like Mr. Biden, Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Klobuchar. Mr. Buttigieg, who eagerly assailed Ms. Warren\u2019s health care policies at the debate in October, was far more veiled in his criticism this time, arguing that Democrats must \u201cgalvanize not polarize\u201d a coalition representing a majority of voters. And Ms. Klobuchar suggested that there were candidates who were making big promises \u201cbecause they sound good on a bumper sticker and then throw in a free car.\u201d But neither of them named names or tried a direct attack as they had done last month. Similarly, Ms. Harris, whose campaign has been on a downward spiral in the polls, notably declined an opportunity to confront Mr. Buttigieg. The leading candidates of the left took much the same approach. Mr. Sanders, defending his support for single-payer health care, referred to skeptical competitors who he said believed \u201cthat we should not take on the insurance company, we should not take on the pharmaceutical industry.\u201d But he did not say to whom he was referring. Mr. Sanders took only an oblique shot at Ms. Warren, who has not prioritized his \u201cMedicare for all\u201d legislation, noting that he would introduce his single-payer system \u201cin the first week\u201d of his presidency. Mr. Biden did not appear to incur new damage to his campaign, which has been durable despite some of his self-inflicted errors. Yet at a moment when a pair of new candidates were entering the race in part because of his perceived weakness, the former vice president appeared tongue-tied on more than one occasion. He drew nervous laughter when, in discussing domestic violence, he said it was important to keep \u201cpunching at\u201d the problem. And when he was boasting about receiving the support of the first African-American woman elected to the Senate, former Senator Carol Moseley Braun, he referred to her as the only black woman elected to the body rather than the first. That prompted a bemused response from Ms. Harris. \u201cThe other one is here,\u201d she said. Mr. Biden, who has staked his campaign on the perception that he is a strong general election candidate, focused on his broad appeal, urging Democrats to pick a nominee who could \u201cgo into states like Georgia and North Carolina and other places and get a Senate majority.\u201d It was, atypically, Mr. Booker, normally a nonconfrontational voice on the debate stage, who opened a more contentious phase in the first half of the debate, critiquing Ms. Warren\u2019s proposal for a tax on the nation\u2019s largest fortunes. \u201cIt\u2019s cumbersome,\u201d Mr. Booker jabbed. \u201cIt\u2019s been tried by other nations. It\u2019s hard to evaluate.\u201d The exchanges grew notably less polite, though, when Ms. Harris was offered a chance to respond on a foreign policy question that went to Ms. Gabbard, who had targeted Ms. Harris at a debate over the summer. Ms. Harris, with payback in mind, ignored the policy element of the question and unloaded on Ms. Gabbard. She noted that her rival had been a frequent guest on Fox News, refused to call Mr. al-Assad \u201ca war criminal\u201d and \u201cbuddied up to Steve Bannon\u201d during Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential transition. Ms. Gabbard responded that Ms. Harris was merely offering \u201clies and smears and innuendo\u201d and asserted that the senator would continue the \u201cBush-Clinton-Trump foreign policy of regime change wars.\u201d Mr. Buttigieg, who is rising rapidly in the polls in Iowa, found himself for the first time in the position of defending his qualifications for the presidency. Mr. Buttigieg, who has never held statewide office, argued that from the vantage point of South Bend it was \u201cthe usual way of doing business in Washington is what looks small.\u201d Two of Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s rivals pushed back more or less gently. Mr. Booker, a former mayor of Newark, described himself as \u201cthe other Rhodes scholar mayor on this stage\u201d \u2014 perhaps his most pointed expression of feeling overlooked in the race. But it was Ms. Klobuchar who most effectively pivoted from her past criticism of Mr. Buttigieg, whom she has described as benefiting in the race from being male, into a forceful plea to the country to elect a female president. \u201cWomen are held to a higher standard, otherwise we could play a game called name your favorite woman president,\u201d Ms. Klobuchar said, brandishing one of her favorite lines from the campaign trail: \u201cIf you think a woman can\u2019t beat Donald Trump, Nancy Pelosi does it every single day.\u201d While she was not as pugilistic as in the last forum, Ms. Klobuchar enjoyed another series of memorable moments in this debate, including a crack about raising money from ex-boyfriends. The businessman Andrew Yang, who has attracted a strong niche following of mostly younger voters, received little time but drew a mix of applause and laughs when he was called on. Asked what he would say, as president, in his first phone call with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, Mr. Yang responded, \u201cWell, first I\u2019d say I\u2019m sorry I beat your guy.\u201d Since the debate last month, the race has become more fluid than ever; former Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts has entered the primary contest, and former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York has taken steps to do the same. They have been lured into the campaign in part over their concerns about the leftward drift in the party, and also because there is still no clear front-runner with just over two months until the Iowa caucuses. It remains far from certain that they will be able to catch on so late in the race, but both have made clear that they are trying to win over more moderate voters.",

      "content": " Pete Buttigieg directly criticized Elizabeth Warren over health care at Tuesday night\u2019s debate, saying that she had not been forthcoming about whether she would raise taxes on the middle class to help finance \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d Ms. Warren, the Massachusetts senator, was asked if she would raise taxes on the middle class, and she responded by focusing on the costs that middle-class families would face. \u201cI will not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle-class families,\u201d she said. Mr. Buttigieg, who last month called Ms. Warren \u201cextremely evasive\u201d on the issue, criticized Ms. Warren for not directly answering the question. \u201cWe heard it tonight,\u201d Mr. Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., said. \u201cA yes-or-no question that didn\u2019t get a yes-or-no answer. Look, this is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular. Your signature, senator, is to have a plan for everything \u2014 except this.\u201d The two candidates went on to argue over the merits of their preferred approaches on health care. Mr. Buttigieg favors what he calls \u201cMedicare for all who want it,\u201d and Ms. Warren took issue with that concept. \u201cUnderstand what that really means: It\u2019s \u2018Medicare for all who can afford it,\u2019\u201d she said. Ms. Warren favors abolishing private health insurance, and Mr. Buttigieg questioned why she wanted to \u201cobliterate\u201d private health plans. \u201cWhy unnecessarily divide this country over health care when there\u2019s a better way to deliver coverage for all?\u201d he asked. Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s campaign continued pressing the issue after the exchange onstage, sending an email to reporters with the subject line: \u201cFACT CHECK: Elizabeth Warren Just Dodged Questions on Middle Class Taxes Again.\u201d Ms. Warren has repeatedly faced questions about how she would pay for Medicare for all. In particular, she has consistently declined to specify whether she would raise taxes on the middle class to help finance such a system. Instead, Ms. Warren has tried to reframe the issue around the total costs that families would face under Medicare for all. She has said that costs would increase for the wealthy and for big corporations, but they would go down for middle-class families \u2014 an explanation she repeated on the debate stage on Tuesday night. She has also said \u201cI\u2019m with Bernie on Medicare for all,\u201d referring to Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who has championed single-payer health care. But unlike Ms. Warren, Mr. Sanders has provided a direct answer to the question of whether taxes on the middle class would rise. \u201cYes, they will pay more in taxes, but less in health care for what they get,\u201d he said in the first series of primary debates, in June. At the debate on Tuesday, Mr. Sanders offered a similar acknowledgment that taxes would go up. \u201cFor virtually everybody,\u201d he said, \u201cthe tax increase they pay will be substantially less \u2014 substantially less than what they were paying for premiums and out-of-pocket expenses.\u201d Mr. Buttigieg found that response to be an improvement over Ms. Warren\u2019s. \u201cWell, at least that\u2019s a straightforward answer,\u201d he said, \u201cbut there\u2019s a better way.\u201d",

Moderates sense a favorable shift.By Alexander BurnsPRINT EDITIONModerates Are Stepping Up to Seize the Day in the Democratic Primary|November 18, 2019, Page A16",
      "author": "Alexander Burns",
      "content": " LAS VEGAS \u2014 After spending months in anxious passivity, staking their hopes on Joseph R. Biden Jr. and little else, moderate Democrats appear suddenly determined to fight for control of their party in the 2020 elections. The shift in attitude has come in fits and starts over the last few weeks, seemingly more as an organic turn in the political season than as a product of coordinated action by party leaders. But each assertive act has seemed to build on the one before, starting with a debate-stage clash last month over \u201cMedicare for all\u201d and culminating in recent days with the entry of two new moderate candidates into the primary, Michael R. Bloomberg and Deval Patrick, and a gentle warning from former President Barack Obama that Democrats should not overestimate voters\u2019 appetite for drastic change. Most convincing to some Democrats may be the off-year elections this month in Kentucky and Louisiana, where moderate-to-conservative Democrats prevailed in governors\u2019 races that President Trump worked strenuously to win for his party. The victories bolstered the argument, advanced by some leading Democrats, that the party could peel away some of Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters in 2020 by avoiding \u201clitmus test\u201d battles and courting the political middle. \u201cClearly, factually, people who voted for Trump voted for our Democratic gubernatorial candidates,\u201d said Gov. Gina Raimondo of Rhode Island, a moderate who leads the Democratic Governors Association. She said Democrats could win those voters in 2020 with a \u201cmessage of unity\u201d and pragmatic promises on issues like health care and student debt. For months the Democratic race was defined in terms of which candidate could promise the most daring policy reforms \u2014 a contest in which Mr. Biden, the former vice president, was struggling to keep pace with Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont. As the most liberal candidates set the agenda, many in the party establishment squirmed, anxious about alienating moderate voters. Now the primary has become an increasingly jumbled contest, shaped by Democrats\u2019 competing appetites for visionary ideas, tactical realism and sheer political novelty. Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., appears to be harnessing those tensions to his advantage, at least in Iowa, where for the first time he emerged as a clear front-runner in a CNN/Des Moines Register poll this weekend. In Nevada, where more than a dozen candidates were gathered for the state party\u2019s \u201cFirst in the West\u201d dinner, Representative Dina Titus was holding up the Democrats\u2019 off-year victories as a reason for optimism heading into 2020. But Ms. Titus, who has not endorsed a candidate in the presidential race, urged the presidential field to be mindful of the \u201cmoderate Democrats in suburban districts\u201d who flipped control of the House last year. \u201cWe have just got to make sure that we appeal across the board,\u201d said Ms. Titus, who introduced both Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders at events this weekend. \u201cWe are a big-tent party.\u201d That proved to be true this month, at least in Louisiana and Kentucky. The Democratic victors in both states, Gov. John Bel Edwards of Louisiana and Andy Beshear, the governor-elect of Kentucky, ran on expanding health care coverage at the state level and largely avoided national issues, like impeachment. Mr. Edwards in particular positioned himself well to the right of the national Democratic Party, opposing abortion rights and new efforts to regulate firearms. No Democratic leaders believe either state will be in play at the presidential level in 2020, and few would argue that the party should shift as far to the right as Mr. Edwards in order to compete. But Representative Cedric Richmond of Louisiana, a leading supporter of Mr. Biden, said on Sunday that Democrats should take the election in his state as a sign that \u201cthe country is not as far to the left as people would have us believe.\u201d \u201cIf you look at Kentucky, if you look at Louisiana, it shows 2020 could be a very good year for Democrats,\u201d Mr. Richmond said, \u201cbut we have to read the tea leaves right, learn the real lesson of what these races are saying.\u201d Many Democratic voters still appear determined to find a Goldilocks-like option in the race \u2014 a candidate who both generates excitement and soothes concern about the general election, someone who promises sweeping change but appears capable of winning Republican votes. Ms. Warren climbed in the polls for months on the strength of her reform message and a mastery of policy that conveyed reassuring competence, but her poll numbers have slipped recently amid intensive scrutiny of her health care plans. Ms. Warren has attempted to allay voters\u2019 reservations on that front in recent weeks by pledging not to raise middle-class taxes to pay for her plans. She also described how she would prioritize improvements to the Affordable Care Act, including the creation of an optional government health-insurance plan, before attempting to create a single-payer system. Both Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders remain among the best-positioned candidates in the primary election, with distinctive appeal to young people and other voters seeking a large-scale redraw of the political system \u2014 an overlapping agenda that drew roars of approval at the \u201cFirst in the West\u201d dinner. At the dinner, both expressed disdain for incremental politics, with Mr. Sanders saying that \u201ctinkering around the edges just won\u2019t do what needs to be done\u201d and Ms. Warren dismissing more modest policies as \u201ca nibble here and a nibble there.\u201d Both are polling at or near the top of the pack in three of the four early primary states, including Nevada. And both are actively working to persuade voters that their approach is the better bet in a general election, including by appealing to voters who feel alienated from the political system. \u201cIf the best that Democrats can offer is business as usual after Donald Trump, then Democrats will lose,\u201d Ms. Warren said at a campaign stop here on Sunday afternoon. \u201cWe win when we have solutions for the problems in people\u2019s lives.\u201d Andrea Griffin, an elementary school nurse in Las Vegas, said she had been wary of Ms. Warren as a general-election candidate but came away feeling more confident after watching her on Sunday. \u201cI was a little skeptical about a plan for everything, but she has a pretty good grasp on what the major issues are and I kind of think that she might be able to get it done,\u201d said Ms. Griffin, 56, a former independent voter who said she registered as a Democrat two weeks ago. Ms. Griffin said she was also curious about Mr. Buttigieg, but had essentially ruled out Mr. Biden, explaining, \u201cI think America is not ready to go back to business as usual.\u201d While he is consistently leading national polls, Mr. Biden\u2019s vulnerability in the primary appears to come, at least in part, from his seeming inability to inspire Democratic voters. He is seen as a sensible and safe option, and a conventionally steady hand for the presidency. At the Nevada Democrats\u2019 dinner on Sunday evening, Mr. Biden urged primary voters to think cautiously: \u201cWe\u2019d better be real careful about who we nominate,\u201d he warned, \u201cbecause the risk of nominating someone who wouldn\u2019t beat Trump is a nation and a world that our children and our grandkids won\u2019t want to live in.\u201d For a good number of primary voters, that appeal is persuasive enough: At Mr. Biden\u2019s town hall-style event in Las Vegas the night before, Phyllis Lind, a retired health care worker who is becoming a substitute teacher, explained her thinking about the race in terms that conveyed her party\u2019s conflicting impulses. She said she was drawn to Ms. Warren because she was \u201cfor the common person,\u201d and to Mr. Buttigieg because he had personal charisma \u201clike Obama.\u201d But at the moment, Ms. Lind, 73, said she was firmly supporting Mr. Biden. \u201cWe need to have a candidate that is going to also get the moderate Republicans,\u201d Ms. Lind said. At the moment, Mr. Buttigieg seems to be claiming an inchoate space that lies between Mr. Sanders\u2019s ideological movement and Mr. Biden\u2019s unapologetically tactical approach to the election. But his rise in the polls has been chiefly confined to the earliest primary states, Iowa and New Hampshire, and he has not generated interest among African-American and Latino voters, cornerstones of the Democratic coalition. At the dinner in Nevada, Mr. Buttigieg repeatedly struck the theme of unity, pledging to \u201cbring together an American majority\u201d for Democratic policies. His prepared remarks also included a rebuke seemingly aimed at Ms. Warren: the text circulated to reporters had Mr. Buttigieg saying that no one should be \u201cwritten out of a particular political party\u201d because of a policy disagreement \u2014 an apparent allusion to Ms. Warren\u2019s recent barb suggesting Mr. Biden might be running in the wrong party\u2019s primary because of his attacks on the idea of single-payer health care. But Mr. Buttigieg did not deliver the line, instead saying he wanted support from people \u201cwhether you are a progressive or a moderate or what I like to call a future former Republican.\u201d Mayor John Cranley of Cincinnati, a moderate Democrat who supports Mr. Buttigieg, said he saw the shift toward Mr. Buttigieg as a function of voters\u2019 intense concern about defeating Mr. Trump. \u201cI think that it\u2019s clear Democrats are focused on winning,\u201d Mr. Cranley said. Pointing to neighboring Kentucky, the northern bulge of which houses the suburban bedroom communities of his own city, Mr. Cranley argued that Mr. Beshear\u2019s victory with right-leaning voters there could be a case study for the national party. To win there, Mr. Cranley said, \u201cYou can\u2019t have somebody who is to the far left on some of these issues.\u201d",

      "subtitle": "5 Takeaways From the November Democratic DebateIt was a mostly bloodless evening among the 10 candidates onstage, but there were some standout moments.By Shane Goldmacher, Reid J. Epstein and Lisa LererPRINT EDITIONNovember 21, 2019",
      "author": "Shane Goldmacher",
      "content": "   With polls showing a highly competitive primary race and no clear front-runner, the Democrats in Wednesday\u2019s debate acted as if they had decided ahead of time to avoid taking risks or doing much of anything that might cause them to lose momentum at this stage of the campaign. It was not flashy. It might not be memorable. But it was revealing. Here are five takeaways: For much of the night, the showdown in Atlanta felt more like a candidate forum than a true clash of visions, as contender after contender seemed more than satisfied to go long periods reciting elements of their stump speeches, rather than contrasting with one another on policy. They disagreed politely with one another, and agreed repeatedly about the menace of President Trump. \u201cI think Joe is right,\u201d Senator Bernie Sanders said at one point to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. \u201cI just want to stick up for Tom,\u201d the businessman Andrew Yang piped up for the billionaire Tom Steyer. \u201cThanks, Andrew,\u201d Mr. Steyer replied. And so it went on  a mostly bloodless evening marked more by civility than caustic confrontations \u2014 besides, that is, Representative Tulsi Gabbard, who sparred aggressively with both Senator Kamala Harris and Mayor Pete Buttigieg, of South Bend, Ind., generating two of the three most tweeted moments of the debate, according to Twitter. A viewer tuning into this debate for the first time would be hard-pressed to say who exactly is the Democratic front-runner in the 2020 primary. Mr. Biden? Sure, he leads in all the national polls, but few onstage seemed eager to challenge him after others who\u2019ve targeted him \u2014 Ms. Harris in June and Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former housing secretary, who did not qualify for this debate \u2014 have faded afterward. Senator Elizabeth Warren? She sure seemed to look like the front-runner a month ago, when she was the object of most of the attacks. But not on Wednesday. The top four candidates \u2014 Mr. Biden, Mr. Buttigieg, Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren \u2014 all spoke the most but none of them suffered against sustained incoming. Hours before the debate, Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign had accidentally sent out a post-debate email that hinted of plans to take on Ms. Warren (\u201cWe need more than plans\u201d), but no such thing materialized onstage. The story of the debate was more of punches pulled than landed. A month after her rivals hammered Ms. Warren for a lack of \u201cMedicare for all\u201d specifics, her fresh $20.5 trillion package to remake the health care system received surprisingly little scrutiny. Mr. Sanders hit Mr. Biden at one point for his support of the Iraq war, but the moderators quickly moved on. Perhaps Mr. Biden\u2019s biggest swing of the night was aimed at an unusual target: dinging the low-polling Mr. Steyer for his past investments in coal. The evening before the debate, one of Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s top advisers, Lis Smith, posted a GIF about debate preparations for an onslaught of attacks to come. That did not happen, at least not until the final moments of the debate, and by then Mr. Buttigieg was settled in onstage. When Senator Amy Klobuchar took a swipe at him as a \u201clocal official,\u201d he was ready with the retort: \u201cThere\u2019s more than 100 years of Washington experience on this stage, and where are we right now as a country?\u201d When Ms. Gabbard accused Mr. Buttigieg of saying he wanted to send troops to Mexico, he brushed her aside. \u201cDo you seriously think anyone on this stage is proposing invading Mexico?\u201d he said. For a candidate who has now vaulted toward the top of the field in Iowa, Mr. Buttigieg skated through most of the evening with surprisingly little scrutiny. Ms. Harris was among those given a chance to take a shot at Mr. Buttigieg over diversity and his lack of support among black voters, but she mostly chose not to do so. Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s response showed his dexterity as a politician, pivoting to his own lived experiences as a married gay man who understood discrimination deeply and personally, if differently. \u201cI care about this because while I do not have the experience of ever having been discriminated against because of the color of my skin, I do have the experience of sometimes feeling like a stranger in my own country,\u201d he said. The Minnesota senator, who is on a slow but steady climb in Iowa polls, drew sharp distinctions between herself and the candidates she perceives as her most effective foils: Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Warren. In a debate devoid of any signature moments or significant rhetorical battles, Ms. Klobuchar delivered a performance designed to appeal to Democrats nervous about the party\u2019s leftward turn and unsure whether to hand the party to a 37-year-old executive of Indiana\u2019s fourth-largest city. \u201cI\u2019m not going to go for things just because they sound good on a bumper sticker and then throw in a free car,\u201d Ms. Klobuchar said. \u201cWe have an obligation as party to, yes, be fiscally responsible, yes, think big, but be honest.\u201d Her hope is that there are a lot of people in Iowa \u2014\u00a0 where Ms. Klobuchar has bet the future of her campaign \u2014 who are drawn to that message. She didn\u2019t back down when read her comments to The New York Times about Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s relative inexperience. Ms. Klobuchar said it\u2019s true that she believes the women running for president face higher standards than the men. Asked why her paid family leave proposal, 12 weeks, is less robust than what other candidates are offering, Ms. Klobuchar didn\u2019t apologize. And she even found an opportunity to deliver the best of the array of jokes she makes on the campaign trail. \u201cMy first Senate race I literally called everyone I knew and I set what is still an all-time Senate record,\u201d she said. \u201cI raised $17,000 from ex-boyfriends.\u201d For a candidate on the ropes, Senator Cory Booker, had an impressively strong evening. He landed a tough hit against Mr. Biden, delivering one of the most notable lines of the night when he wondered if Mr. Biden was \u201chigh\u201d for saying he opposed marijuana legalization on the federal level. \u201cMarijuana in our country is already legal for privileged people,\u201d Mr. Booker said. He argued that the party must nominate someone who can inspire black voters \u2014 a knock on Mr. Buttigieg, who has struggled to build support among communities of color. \u201cWe need to have someone that can inspire, as Kamala said, to inspire African-Americans to the polls in record numbers,\u201d Mr. Booker said. And he closed with one of the most direct pleas of the evening. Mr. Booker\u2019s solid performance in past debates hasn\u2019t been enough to change his fortunes in the race, and he is now at serious risk of failing to meet the polling and fund-raising standard necessary to make the December debate. \u201cKeep me on the stage,\u201d he all but begged, in his final statement. Afterward, Mr. Booker reported on Twitter that he had raised more online in the hour after the debate than on any previous fund-raising day.",

      "author": "Neil Vigdor",
      "content": " At their best, they were clever and unscripted. A timely comeback. A witty one-liner. At their worst, they were robotic and rambling. Clumsy. Cringe-worthy. Here are some of the most memorable moments from Wednesday\u2019s Democratic presidential debate in Atlanta, hosted by MSNBC and The Washington Post. Senator Kamala Harris of California said President Trump had compromised the checks and balances on North Korea\u2019s nuclear capabilities with his unilateral dealings with the country\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un. She said Mr. Trump was the greatest threat to the national security of the United States, pointing to his decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement and the Iran nuclear deal, as well as his decision to pull American troops from Northern Syria. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts opened the debate by saying Gordon D. Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union, had no qualifications other than his $1 million contribution to President Trump\u2019s inaugural committee. Ms. Warren said Mr. Sondland\u2019s testimony during an impeachment proceeding in the House of Representatives on Wednesday added to the mounting evidence that President Trump had tied foreign aid to Ukraine to an investigation of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s son. Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., said that Mr. Trump was not putting critical military resources into things like artificial intelligence for border security. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota avoided a direct attack on Mr. Buttigieg when asked about her comment that a woman with his credentials would not be doing as well as a candidate. But Ms. Klobuchar did not shrink from the moment of getting a point across that women candidates are treated differently. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey created a buzz with his dig at Mr. Biden, who recently said he opposed the legalization of marijuana. Mr. Booker said Mr. Biden\u2019s position on cannabis was at odds with the progressive wing of the Democratic Party and many black Americans, who he said have been disproportionately hurt by criminal charges related to marijuana. Andrew Yang, the former tech executive and entrepreneur, was asked what he would say to Vladimir Putin in their first conservation if elected president. Mr. Yang answered that he would tell the Russian president that his \u201cdays of meddling in American elections are over.\u201d Mr. Biden quipped about a recent swipe at him by Mr. Kim, as quoted by North Korean state media. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont then interjected, \u201cOther than that, you like him,\u201d which drew laughs from the candidates and audience. Mr. Biden used the wrong metaphor as a point of emphasis when asking what he would do to address the culture of violence toward women in the United States. He started his answer by urging Congress to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, which Mr. Biden championed when he was a member of the United States Senate. Mr. Biden, who has enjoyed strong polling numbers among black voters, rattled off a list of endorsements of prominent African-American lawmakers and said there was reason that his appeal transcended racial lines. But Mr. Biden flubbed the number of black women who have served in the Senate: there have been two. He was endorsed by former Senator Carol Moseley Braun of Illinois, the first black woman elected to the chamber. The second, Ms. Harris, was onstage to his left.",

      "content": " DES MOINES \u2014 Pete Buttigieg continues to surge in Iowa, leapfrogging Senator Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. to hold a commanding lead among likely Democratic caucusgoers, according to a new poll from The Des Moines Register and CNN. The poll showed that Mr. Buttigieg, the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Ind., was the first choice for 25 percent of would-be Democratic caucusgoers, a significant increase from the 9 percent he held in September, when The Register last polled the state. The support placed him far ahead of the rest of the field \u2014 with the other three top candidates in a virtual tie for second: Ms. Warren at 16 percent and Mr. Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders at 15 percent. The results are the latest evidence of Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s strength in Iowa, where his moderate political views, plain-spoken style and military history have resonated in the early voting state. Since September, when he placed fourth in the Register poll, he has more than doubled his on-the-ground staff to over 100 and has opened more than 20 field offices. He recently completed another bus tour in the state. Speaking to reporters in Long Beach, Calif., on Saturday night during the state\u2019s Democratic convention, Mr. Buttigieg said the just-released poll numbers were \u201cextremely encouraging.\u201d \u201cWe have felt a lot of momentum on the ground,\u201d he said. His rise also suggests that voters, in Iowa at least, are increasingly favoring a centrist agenda \u2014 a view that has drawn two new entrants, Deval Patrick, the former governor of Massachusetts, and Michael R. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City, into the race this month. The poll results reflect the deep split within the Democratic Party over whether it is veering too far to the left to defeat President Trump. Speaking on Friday to a room of wealthy liberal donors, former President Barack Obama expressed concern about some of the policy ideas being promoted by some of the candidates, citing health care and immigration as issues where the proposals may not align with public opinion. Though he did not single out any candidates directly, his remarks were seen as an implicit criticism of Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren, two of the leading candidates who are pushing policy plans once considered too liberal, like \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d with the broader goal of \u201cpolitical revolution\u201d and \u201cbig, structural change.\u201d \u201cEven as we push the envelope and we are bold in our vision we also have to be rooted in reality,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cThe average American doesn\u2019t think we have to completely tear down the system and remake it.\u201d Ms. Warren, who led the Register\u2019s September poll, with 22 percent, fell 6 percentage points. Her poll numbers are now roughly what they were in June, when she was at 15 percent. Mr. Sanders, who suffered a heart attack shortly after the last poll results were released, climbed 4 percentage points. Mr. Biden, who has seen his standing in Iowa slowly slip, dropped 5 percentage points. In addition to identifying a new Iowa front-runner, the poll has once again delineated a clear divide between the top tier of Democratic candidates \u2014 Mr. Buttigieg, Ms. Warren, Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders \u2014 and the rest of the field. The next-closest candidate in the poll was Senator Amy Klobuchar, with 6 percent, followed by a cluster of White House hopefuls with 3 percent, including Senator Cory Booker, Senator Kamala Harris and Andrew Yang. Mr. Bloomberg, who has suggested he would skip the first four early nominating states, including Iowa, if he were to officially enter the race, was at 2 percent.",

      "content": " It was a busy week in the Democratic presidential campaign, with a flood of new policies and, of course, another debate. Let\u2019s get right to it. There weren\u2019t a lot of sparks in this week\u2019s debate, the fifth of the Democratic primary. But in the absence of a clear front-runner, several lower-polling candidates were able to break through \u2014 at least for one news cycle. Senators Kamala Harris of California, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Cory Booker of New Jersey all had strong nights. So did Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., who did not face nearly as many attacks as expected in his first appearance since he shot to the top of the field in Iowa. Mr. Buttigieg has had a remarkable rise in Iowa, rocketing from 9 percent (fourth place) in a CNN/Des Moines Register poll in September to 25 percent (first place) in one released last weekend. Between that and a Monmouth University poll four days earlier also showing him in first place, it is clear that Mr. Buttigieg has become a serious contender there. The bad news for him: He is polling terribly among black voters. A Quinnipiac poll in South Carolina, where black Democrats are the most powerful voting bloc in the primary, showed him at 0 percent in that group. And while his current supporter base could be enough for him to win Iowa, which is mostly white, no Democrat in modern history has won the presidential nomination without winning a majority of black voters. After the debate, several candidates fanned across Atlanta to pitch themselves to black audiences. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts gave a speech at Clark Atlanta University on Thursday evening, saying that \u201crace-neutral laws\u201d were not enough, and that the government had an obligation to mend the damage caused by \u201cdecades of active, state-sponsored discrimination.\u201d She was joined onstage by Representative Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, who has endorsed her, and Ms. Pressley ended up speaking directly to pro-charter-school protesters who interrupted the speech. Earlier in the day, Ms. Harris held a \u201cblack women\u2019s breakfast,\u201d and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont gave a speech tying his family\u2019s experience in the Holocaust to the discrimination black Americans face. Mayor Wayne Messam of Miramar, Fla., ended his presidential campaign on Wednesday. If you hadn\u2019t known he was running to begin with, well, don\u2019t worry about it. Mr. Messam had never appeared on a debate stage, reaching only 1 percent in exactly two debate-qualifying polls all year, and had raised a mere $15,000 in the third quarter. \u201cI knew the odds were a steep hill to climb, but I have always fought for what is right and will continue to break barriers never broken,\u201d he said in announcing his withdrawal. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. introduced a wide-ranging plan this week to expand on the Violence Against Women Act. Among other things, it would create a new housing program for survivors of sexual assault and domestic abuse, require colleges and universities to improve reporting systems, establish a task force on online harassment and provide $100 million a year to end the backlog of untested rape kits. The proposal also focuses on survivors\u2019 ability to sue: It would ban mandatory arbitration clauses that block employees from suing over sexual harassment and restore a provision in the act that would allow people to take civil action against their abusers in federal court. The Supreme Court blocked that provision in 1999, and Mr. Biden is calling on Congress to pass a version that \u201cfills the gaps the Court found fatal last time.\u201d Mr. Biden was one of seven candidates who released plans this week \u2014 including Ms. Warren, who, as is her wont, released two. We will leave you with Ms. Harris\u2019s reaction after Mr. Biden, touting an endorsement from former Senator Carol Moseley Braun of Illinois, said he had the support of the only black woman elected to the Senate.",

New Polls Differ on Who\u2019s the Front-Runner in 2020 Race|October 25, 2019, Page A12",
      "author": "Matt Stevens",
      "content": "  Just over three months before Iowans caucus for Democratic presidential candidates, four polls out this week present a muddled picture of a primary race that is unfolding in varying, and sometimes conflicting, ways nationally and in early-voting states. A pair of new national polls present starkly different results. A CNN survey released Wednesday had former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. with a commanding lead of 15 percentage points ahead of Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. But a Quinnipiac University poll released Thursday had Ms. Warren as the front-runner, seven points ahead of Mr. Biden. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont finished a strong third in both national polls, suggesting that his standing in the race has not been diminished by his heart attack earlier this month \u2014 and that he may have been buoyed by endorsements from Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota. Two other polls from early-voting states show a tight race in Iowa and Mr. Biden maintaining a comfortable lead in South Carolina. Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., continued to show particular strength in Iowa, earning third place and 13 percent support in the Suffolk University/USA Today poll of Iowa Democrats released on Monday. Senator Kamala Harris of California, who is now staking her campaign on a top-three finish there, was in a four-way tie for fifth in that poll with 3 percent support. It is not clear why the CNN and Quinnipiac polls present such divergent results for Ms. Warren and Mr. Biden. But the polls, both considered to be of high quality and able to help candidates qualify for the next Democratic debate, add data points to a divide that has emerged in recent weeks: between surveys that show Mr. Biden with a commanding lead, and those that have him in a statistical dead heat with Ms. Warren. A number of things can affect a poll\u2019s results, including the wording of a horse-race question and the order that items are asked. In CNN and Fox News polls\u00a0this year, respondents have typically been asked for their opinions on each of the Democratic presidential candidates, among other questions, before being queried about their vote preference. In Quinnipiac\u2019s polls \u2014\u00a0as well as those conducted by Monmouth University, which have also shown Ms. Warren climbing steadily \u2014 people have not typically been asked to evaluate the candidates one-by-one before giving their vote choice. If such small differences in survey structure are indeed having an effect on results, it may reflect the fact that many respondents are not yet certain about their feelings. The CNN poll released this week brought that point home, finding that a majority of Democratic voters who favored one candidate \u2014 53 percent \u2014 said they could still change their mind about whom to support for the nomination. \u201cIt makes me think that voters are not settled, that they\u2019re still shopping for a candidate \u2014 that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing some movement between polls,\u201d Doug Schwartz, Quinnipiac\u2019s polling director, said Thursday in a telephone interview. The Quinnipiac poll also qualified Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota for the debate next month in Georgia, making her the ninth candidate to do so. Candidates must meet a donor requirement set by the Democratic National Committee as well as a polling requirement; Ms. Klobuchar, who is getting a second look after a strong performance in the October debate, received 3 percent support in the Quinnipiac survey and two others this week, giving her a total of four qualifying polls and securing her spot in the debate next month. National polls can offer a snapshot of the Democratic electorate\u2019s mood, and the extent to which a candidate\u2019s debate performance has helped or hurt a campaign. The Quinnipiac poll, which had a margin of error of five percentage points, said Ms. Warren had registered 28 percent support compared with 21 percent for Mr. Biden. Mr. Biden\u2019s support in the survey was down six points from a similar national poll that Quinnipiac released 10 days earlier and was conducted before the October debate; Ms. Warren\u2019s support was around the same in that poll. Support for Mr. Sanders rose slightly in the post-debate poll, to 15 percent, while Mr. Buttigieg remained in fourth place with 10 percent. The CNN poll, which had a margin of error of four percentage points, put Mr. Biden\u2019s support at 34 percent and Ms. Warren\u2019s at 19 percent. It seemed to add credibility to the results coming out of Fox News and other polling operations, which have consistently shown Mr. Biden alone at the front of the Democratic pack. Members of CNN\u2019s polling team declined to comment about the results of their latest survey. At the state level, the Suffolk University/USA Today poll of Iowa Democrats showed Mr. Biden in the lead with 18 percent support, Ms. Warren just behind him with 17 percent, Mr. Buttigieg next with 13 percent and Mr. Sanders finishing fourth with just 9 percent support. The outcome of Iowa voters\u2019 caucus in February could influence South Carolina voters, who go to the polls about four weeks later. Throughout the primary, Mr. Biden has held on to a steady and sizable lead in the polls there. The Monmouth University poll out of South Carolina this week showed his support there dipping to 33 percent this month from 39 percent in July, but Ms. Warren still finished a distant second with 16 percent support. Mark Blumenthal, an independent pollster who has advised Democratic candidates, pointed out that turnout in presidential primaries and caucuses is generally quite low \u2014 sometimes under 1 percent in some state contests. For this reason, the results of any survey that polls all registered Democratic voters nationwide is bound to capture many people who will not in fact participate. \u201cThe big challenge of polling in any election is measuring a population that doesn\u2019t yet exist,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. That is true of \u201cpresidential primaries in particular \u2014 because they\u2019re a small fraction of the larger population and because they\u2019re these very high-profile events where the composition can change dramatically from election to election.\u201d \u201cOdds are good,\u201d Mr. Blumenthal added, \u201cthese results will converge as we get closer to voting.\u201d",

But it can give us the perspectives of some of the people with expertise on primary races: veteran campaign strategists, consultants and advocates from both parties. Here is a sampling of their reactions. Senator Kamala Harris of California, trying to stop her campaign\u2019s slide, got perhaps her best reviews since the first debate in June \u2014 the one that shot her up in the polls for a few weeks. Commentators were not unanimous on Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., \u2014 who has risen to or near the top of recent polls, especially in Iowa \u2014 but for the most part, they thought he did well under the increased scrutiny. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota earned praise for several responses, but most prominently her defense of her argument that she and the other women running would struggle to win support with Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s level of political experience. And Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey did well against former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts had the most speaking time of any candidate but did not make the biggest impression. But strategists and commentators generally said she and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont did what they needed to do to maintain their positions in the race, and both of them had standout moments \u2014 especially on impeachment for Ms. Warren and climate change for Mr. Sanders. In what has become a pattern, Mr. Biden drew good marks for his responses on foreign policy \u2014 consistently a strong point for him in debates \u2014 but groans for his responses on race.",

      "author": "Reid J. Epstein",
      "content": "  [Follow our live coverage of tonight\u2019s Democratic debate.] Ten Democratic presidential candidates will take the debate stage in Atlanta on Wednesday night, but the spotlight is likely to follow two contenders who have risen to the top of polls over the last several months: Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. Here is what to watch for as the candidates debate: Last month in Ohio, Ms. Warren took incoming fire from four different rivals. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Mr. Buttigieg led the attack against her health care proposals, Senator Kamala Harris of California made a disjointed plea for Ms. Warren to sign onto her call for Twitter to ban President Trump and Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii demanded to know how Ms. Warren was qualified to serve as commander-in-chief. Since then, Ms. Warren has seen her polling position diminish as she has sought to explain how she would finance \u201cMedicare for all\u201d beyond the \u201cI\u2019m with Bernie\u201d line that she offered earlier in the campaign. But the attacks against her haven\u2019t stopped. She remains a useful foil for Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg \u2014 along with Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota \u2014 as they jostle to be the standard-bearer for the party\u2019s moderate wing. Ms. Warren has shown no indication she\u2019s willing to give ground. During a speech to Iowa Democrats this month she used the word \u201cfight\u201d 21 times in 12 minutes. Her argument that the party will lose to Mr. Trump if it nominates a candidate who fears her bold proposals has become central to her campaign stump speech. Expect both dynamics to be on full display in Atlanta, though this time Ms. Warren will be prepared to defend Medicare for all in a more detailed fashion than she has demonstrated to date. For weeks, aggravation about Mr. Buttigieg among his rivals has been simmering. It\u2019s about to boil over Wednesday night. With the 37-year-old holding a commanding first-place position in the latest Des Moines Register poll, his opponents are ready to attack him. Ms. Harris said Mr. Buttigieg would \u201chave to answer\u201d for using a stock photograph from Kenya to illustrate his plan for African-Americans on his campaign website. Ms. Klobuchar has taken her quiet asides about his lack of experience to the Sunday talk shows. And Ms. Warren dismissed Mr. Buttigieg for running a \u201cconsultant-driven campaign with some vague ideas that are designed not to offend anyone.\u201d At the same time, the volume of opposition research being pitched by rival campaigns about Mr. Buttigieg has increased, focusing on 9-year-old friendly remarks about the Tea Party and his stewardship of the municipal government in South Bend. In previous debates, Mr. Buttigieg has easily parried attacks from his rivals \u2014 that task will become tougher as scrutiny on him increases. While Ms. Warren laid out a plan last week to pass a full Medicare for all system by her third year in the White House, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont said he\u2019d get it done right away. \u201cI will engage that struggle on day one of my administration,\u201d Mr. Sanders said Friday in California. \u201cNot put it off for several years.\u201d Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren, long ideological partners, have mostly avoided direct conflict on the campaign trail. But the Medicare for all issue affords each of them an opportunity to create political distance. Mr. Sanders can once again brand himself as the purest advocate for his political revolution. Ms. Warren, meanwhile, will have to navigate between appealing to the party\u2019s most progressive voters and not frightening away moderate Democrats by tying herself too closely to Mr. Sanders. The Democratic differences on how to fix America\u2019s health care system have consumed much of the airtime in debate after debate, and the coming clash in Atlanta is expected to be more of the same. In the last debate, Ms. Warren was hammered for lacking her own Medicare for all plan. She has since rolled out a comprehensive package that more moderate Democrats, like Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg, have said is unrealistic and unworkable. Mr. Biden has used health care to raise other questions about Ms. Warren, calling her an elitist with a \u201cmy way or the highway\u201d approach to governance. Mr. Buttigieg has been advertising in Iowa to promote his \u201cMedicare for all who want it\u201d approach, which Ms. Warren has said will not fundamentally fix the system. The recent Des Moines Register/CNN poll showed how divided the party is on the topic, with 36 percent favoring a Medicare for all plan that eliminates private insurance, 34 percent wanting a \u201cpublic option\u201d and 20 percent saying they preferred restoring provisions in the Affordable Care Act. Midway through the second week of impeachment gobbling the entire Washington news cycle, the presidential candidates would still rather talk about almost anything else. Yet it seems implausible \u2014 if not impossible \u2014 for Wednesday night\u2019s debate moderators to avoid asking the White House hopefuls about the House inquiry unfolding daily on live television. But what can the candidates say at this point? They\u2019re all for impeaching Mr. Trump. But while they know that wanting the president removed from office is the cost of entry for the Democratic primary, voters would much rather see a discussion about the sort of issues that are central to their daily lives: health care, climate change and the economy. Even Tom Steyer, the California billionaire who spent years on a campaign calling for Mr. Trump\u2019s impeachment, is talking about other issues on the trail. So expect to see the moderators quiz the candidates about the latest developments from Washington, as they then pivot to something else. Things are not going well for the California senator. Since the last debate, she has shuttered her New Hampshire offices. She has laid off staff and shifted resources from her Baltimore headquarters to Iowa. And she has continued a slide in the polls, which now show her closer to the bottom tier than to the top. The challenge is that Ms. Harris has already delivered one of the most memorable debate moments of the primary \u2014 her takedown of Mr. Biden on busing \u2014 but the bump she received quickly faded. She has since turned her focus on Mr. Trump in one debate, and challenged Ms. Warren to call for kicking the president off Twitter in another. She does not have a signature policy focus \u2014 she has called to cut middle-class taxes as a top priority \u2014 that seems ripe to pop. It is not clear what tack she will take on Wednesday evening (she could be among the many ready to pile onto Mr. Buttigieg), but the pressure to perform is strong.",

      "content": " GREENWOOD, S.C. \u2014 Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and an immigrants\u2019 rights activist on Thursday engaged in an unusually extended clash over Obama-era deportation policies. For more than six minutes in a palpably tense gym here during a town hall-style event at Lander University, Mr. Biden sparred with the activist, Carlos Rojas, an organizer with the immigrants\u2019 rights group Movimiento Cosecha. The organization is urging presidential candidates to back a moratorium on deportations on their first day in office and has protested Mr. Biden before. \u201cYou should vote for Trump,\u201d Mr. Biden admonished Mr. Rojas during one of the most heated moments, after Mr. Rojas rattled off deportation figures under the Obama administration amid scattered cries of \u201cgive him the mic!\u201d \u201cYou should vote for Trump,\u201d Mr. Biden repeated. \u201cNo, no,\u201d Mr. Rojas said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to do that.\u201d Mr. Biden was not the only presidential candidate to face protesters Thursday evening. In Atlanta, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts was interrupted during a speech at Clark Atlanta University by a group of charter school activists. In South Carolina, Mr. Rojas began the exchange by translating for an immigrant named Silvia who raised concerns about the deportation numbers under former President Barack Obama. \u201cIf you were to be president, will you stop deportations on Day 1 through executive action?\u201d Mr. Rojas asked. \u201cNo,\u201d Mr. Biden responded. \u201cI will not stop all deportations. I will prioritize deportations only of people who have committed a felony or a serious crime, number one.\u201d He walked over to stand near Mr. Rojas and Silvia. \u201cNumber two,\u201d he continued, \u201cto compare President Obama to this guy is outrageous.\u201d The room applauded. Mr. Biden went on to defend the Obama administration\u2019s record on immigration, and said he would not discuss any areas of internal disagreement with Mr. Obama. And he repeatedly said he would not back a total moratorium on deportations, even as his remarks were punctuated several times by protesters who shouted, \u201cNot one more deportation.\u201d After Mr. Biden promised that there would not be family separations under his administration, someone shouted, \u201cThat\u2019s a lie!\u201d \u201cNo matter what happens, someone commits murder, they shouldn\u2019t be deported,\u201d Mr. Biden said, characterizing the protesters\u2019 position with an edge in his voice. By then, Mr. Rojas had left his seat and was standing next to Mr. Biden in the center of the room. \u201cNo, I\u2019m asking you a question,\u201d Mr. Biden added. The exchange finally ended as the protesters left the room and the rest of the audience applauded Mr. Biden. In several Democratic debates this year, Mr. Biden has faced criticism from his rivals over the Obama administration\u2019s deportation practices when Mr. Biden was serving as vice president. Mr. Biden, meanwhile, is a fierce critic of the hard-line immigration policies of the Trump administration, especially of family separation. Minutes after the immigrants\u2019 rights protesters left, he faced another interruption. \u201cI do not take money from corporations!\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cYou listen to Bernie too much.\u201d The clashes upended what had been an otherwise friendly town hall \u2014 but some voters afterward commended Mr. Biden\u2019s stewardship of the incident. Dan Healy, 70, said that he liked that Mr. Biden \u201csaid he wouldn\u2019t stop deportations for criminals.\u201d \u201cYeah, he didn\u2019t back down,\u201d Mr. Healy\u2019s wife, Lora Healy, 72, said. Ms. Warren was in the opening minutes of her speech, a major address on racial inequities, when she was disrupted. In an interview, an organizer of the protest, Dianechia Fields, 40, who is from Memphis, criticized Ms. Warren for pledging to cut funding for charter schools. Ms. Warren\u2019s education plan calls for ending federal funding for opening new charter schools and banning for-profit charters. Ms. Warren eventually received some assistance from Representative Ayanna S. Pressley of Massachusetts, who had introduced her at the event. Ms. Pressley came back onstage and urged the protesters to let Ms. Warren proceed with her speech, which highlighted the story of black washerwomen who went on strike in Atlanta in 1881. \u201cWe are grateful for your activism and your voice and you are welcome here, and we would love to convene after this about the issue that you are here to stoke our consciousness about,\u201d Ms. Pressley said. \u201cBut when these women have been ignored this long, this is their moment, and we are going to hear the story.\u201d",

      "content": " Elizabeth Warren had never taken on the federal government before. But in 1995, she found herself up against the Clinton administration, representing the Cleveland-based conglomerate LTV Steel. Even though LTV had sold off its coal mines during the 1980s, a new law required it to contribute to a health fund for retired miners. LTV believed that it should not have to pay. Those claims, the company said, should have been handled as part of its bankruptcy reorganization. Ms. Warren\u2019s job was to convince the Supreme Court to hear LTV\u2019s case. The court declined, but for Ms. Warren, the issue would fester. Over a decade later, when she ran for the Senate from Massachusetts in 2012, the Republican incumbent, Senator Scott Brown of Massachusetts, tried to use her work for LTV against her, unleashing an ad calling her a \u201chired gun\u201d who sided \u201cagainst working people.\u201d Notwithstanding the attack, Mr. Brown lost his seat to Ms. Warren. The LTV case was part of a considerable body of legal work that Ms. Warren, one of the nation\u2019s leading bankruptcy experts, took on while working as a law professor \u2014 moonlighting that earned her hundreds of thousands of dollars over roughly two decades beginning in the late 1980s, mostly while she was on the faculty at Harvard. Much of it involved representing big corporate clients. Ms. Warren has ascended toward the head of the Democratic presidential pack on the strength of her populist appeal and progressive plans, which include breaking up big technology companies, free public college and a wealth tax on the richest Americans. Her political opponents, in turn, have sought to find a soft spot on issues of authenticity \u2014 chiefly Ms. Warren\u2019s handling of her claim to Native American ancestry. Against that backdrop, some of Ms. Warren\u2019s critics have seized upon her bankruptcy work for LTV and other big corporations to question the depth of her progressive bona fides. How, they wonder, could someone whose reputation is built on consumer advocacy have represented a company seeking to avoid paying for retired miners\u2019 health care? Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign did not make her available to discuss her outside legal work, though it did provide email responses to some questions. But over the years, Ms. Warren has twice released accounts of her practice \u2014 a partial list of cases during the 2012 Senate race and a fuller list of more than 50 cases posted to her presidential campaign website in May. Among her corporate clients were Travelers insurance and the aircraft maker Fairchild, as well as one of America\u2019s wealthiest families, the Hunts of Texas. She advocated for a railroad company that wanted to avoid paying for a Superfund cleanup, and advised Dow Chemical as its subsidiary Dow Corning dealt with thousands of complaints from women who said they had been harmed by its silicone breast implants. But she also worked on a number of cases involving consumer bankruptcy and victims\u2019 rights in asbestos litigation, served as an expert in a lawsuit against the cigarette maker Philip Morris and represented the lawyer whose battles with polluters inspired the film \u201cA Civil Action.\u201d In very brief and simplified summaries, the lists cast much of her work \u2014 even for corporate clients \u2014 in terms that align with her pro-consumer narrative. Those descriptions have themselves become a focus of some contention. But a review by The New York Times, together with interviews with several of Ms. Warren\u2019s former compatriots in the rarefied world of self-described bankruptcy nerds, reveals a complex picture in which many cases defy simple black or white categorization. It also offers a look at a relatively unexamined aspect of her thinking. Her work, the scholars say, should be understood primarily as an effort to preserve the right to file for bankruptcy and the integrity of the bankruptcy system. \u201cAs far as I can tell, the kind of positions she took were positions that were completely consistent with someone who was dedicated to the value of the bankruptcy process,\u201d said Douglas G. Baird, a University of Chicago Law School bankruptcy expert who differs philosophically from Ms. Warren on some issues in the field and says he is not a political supporter. Indeed, in her most recent list of cases, Ms. Warren wrote that bankruptcy \u201cinevitably pits sympathetic interests against each other \u2014 current victims against future victims, employees against retirees and small suppliers against customers who didn\u2019t get what they were promised.\u201d The challenge, she concluded, is \u201cbalancing all of these interests in the fairest way possible.\u201d Mr. Baird also suggested that in some cases, Ms. Warren was simply advocating for clients, not necessarily with an eye toward the future popularity of her positions. Lawyers, he said, are not ideologues, but are to some extent \u201cplumbers or mechanics trying to be zealous advocates for their clients.\u201d Ms. Warren has acknowledged that for much of her long and varied career she was not politically engaged and had no plan to run for public office. Until 1996, she was registered as a Republican. In taking on outside clients, Ms. Warren augmented her salary at Harvard, where she was among the most highly paid faculty members. In 1998, the Harvard Crimson reported that she was paid $192,550 in salary plus $133,450 in \u201cother compensation.\u201d It is not possible to tell how much Ms. Warren made from her legal consultancy, and she declined to reveal the amount, but it was clearly more than $500,000 and probably much more. Most of the work fell outside the period when she was required to submit financial disclosure reports. Travelers paid her more than $200,000 over several years for advice on dealing with asbestos claims against its insured, Johns Manville. In 2010, Ms. Warren was paid $90,000 to write two expert opinions on behalf of merchants who were suing credit card companies and banks, alleging antitrust violations in processing fees. Because she was heading up the congressional panel monitoring the bank bailout at the time, Senator Richard Shelby, Republican of Alabama, raised questions about whether the work presented a conflict of interest. Some conflict-of-interest provisions had been waived, however, because members of the panel were experts who served part-time. For her work with Caplin & Drysdale, a firm representing plaintiffs in a number of asbestos-related cases, Ms. Warren billed $675 an hour, in line with what partners in top New York firms charged at the time. While some law professors look askance at outside work, regarding it as impure, most schools permit it, and Harvard has encouraged it, according to Randall L. Kennedy, a law professor there and former colleague of Ms. Warren. \u201cThe idea that you would be in government, you would be consulted, you would be a big shot in the legal profession, I think that was viewed as one of the distinctive parts of the Harvard Law School ethos,\u201d said Mr. Kennedy, who noted that some of his best-known colleagues maintained very active practices. \u201cThat\u2019s how we roll.\u201d It is an unglamorous area of law, and it rarely makes news. That\u2019s why the bankruptcy nerds who post to a blog called Credit Slips were shocked in 2012 when a decade-old bankruptcy case became a hot political topic. \u201cLTV has amazingly become an issue in the U.S. Senate race in Massachusetts,\u201d wrote John A. E. Pottow, a former Harvard student of Ms. Warren who teaches bankruptcy at the University of Michigan Law School. \u201cA bankruptcy case!\u201d Ms. Warren\u2019s record in the LTV case is a textbook example of how complex legal matters can be seen in vastly different ways. Viewed through a layman\u2019s eyes, Ms. Warren appeared to be fighting against working people. Some bankruptcy experts, however, viewed her motivations as more far-reaching \u2014 aimed at preserving a system that ultimately offers working people some measure of protection. The origins of the 1995 case dated back to the Truman administration. To settle a coal miners strike, the federal government forged an agreement that miners would have health care coverage when they retired, provided by their last employer. Over the years, as demand for coal declined, companies closed their mines and stopped paying these benefits. To remedy the problem, in 1992, Congress passed the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act, to provide benefits for more than 100,000 retired miners. Each company that had operated coal mines, even those no longer in the business, would be required to pay into a fund for their retirees. LTV objected to paying into the fund. The company had filed for bankruptcy in 1986, resolving claims from thousands of employees. The Coal Act, LTV now argued, retroactively imposed new liabilities based on events that had taken place years earlier and that therefore should have been resolved during bankruptcy. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed, ruling that LTV\u2019s liabilities were not technically \u201cclaims\u201d under the bankruptcy code because they had been created by a new act of Congress. Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign has said she engaged in outside legal work primarily when there was a larger issue at stake, which is what Mr. Baird believed she had in mind when she agreed to represent LTV in its Supreme Court petition. \u201cCan Congress make that law apply retroactively even to firms that have had their day of reckoning in bankruptcy?\u201d Mr. Baird said. \u201cIf you believe in the bankruptcy system, you can argue that you shouldn\u2019t do this retroactive second-guessing.\u201d In her petition asking the Supreme Court to review the decision, Ms. Warren wrote that bankruptcy \u201ccontemplates that all legal obligations of the debtor, no matter how remote or contingent, will be dealt with by the bankruptcy case.\u201d \u201cThe Second Circuit,\u201d she added, \u201cthreatens to erode that concept, with serious implications for future bankruptcies.\u201d This year, nearly 15 years after the Supreme Court declined to review the case, Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign described her work this way: \u201cIn this case, Elizabeth represented a company that was asking the Supreme Court to reverse a lower court\u2019s ruling that limited the ability of future employees, retirees and victims to receive any compensation at all from bankrupt companies.\u201d In bankruptcy, there is a day of reckoning, the point at which a debtor\u2019s accounts are squared. As with LTV, several of Ms. Warren\u2019s more prominent cases involved questions of what happens when claims arise after that day. Such claims are regarded as potentially eroding the system and undermining the chance for a \u201cfresh start\u201d for companies and individuals that file bankruptcy. Ms. Warren at one point praised how the system gave a second chance to several well-known companies, including one of Donald J. Trump\u2019s businesses. \u201cGeneral Motors, Trump Enterprises, Hershey Foods and dozens of other well-known companies all survived early bankruptcies, she wrote in 2009. \u201cSecond chances opened the way for Francis Ford Coppola, Willie Nelson and Mark Twain to leave their marks on world cinema, music and literature.\u201d Any development that undermines that principle is \u201cgoing to create a mess in the bankruptcy system,\u201d said Adam J. Levitin, a professor at Georgetown University Law Center who studied under Ms. Warren. He added, \u201cIf all these new liabilities start appearing, the bankruptcy system doesn\u2019t work.\u201d In one case that turned on these issues, Ms. Warren found herself on the same side as Kenneth Starr, who at the time was also the independent counsel leading a long-running investigation of the Clinton White House. The case involved a company called CMC Heartland Partners and a Superfund site near Tacoma, Wash., named one of the 10 most hazardous in the country. CMC Heartland was the successor company to the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul & Pacific Railroad Company \u2014 known colloquially as the Milwaukee Road \u2014 which had filed for bankruptcy in 1977. Union Pacific Railroad subsequently acquired the company\u2019s old Tacoma rail yards, where it discovered an environmental disaster of oil and other industrial waste. When CMC refused to pay for the cleanup \u2014 arguing that the claims were barred by its predecessor company\u2019s bankruptcy \u2014 Union Pacific sued. In 1996, after a federal appeals court ruled against CMC, Ms. Warren filed a brief asking the solicitor general to support a Supreme Court review. The implications of allowing the lower court ruling to stand, Ms. Warren argued, would be profound \u201cfor those who are trying to put the assets of those businesses back into productive use, for those who face uncompensated injuries and for those who have other claims against the business.\u201d The Supreme Court declined to hear the case. Another such case, in 1995, involved Fairchild, the aircraft manufacturer. Two years before, a well-known NASCAR driver named Alan Kulwicki and three associates had been killed when their Fairchild Merlin crashed near Blountville, Tenn. In a lawsuit, survivors of the four dead men sought compensation from Fairchild, arguing that their death was related to a defect in the aircraft and that, even though the manufacturer had filed for bankruptcy and been taken over by a newly established company, the new company should be liable. Ms. Warren represented the new company, arguing that it had bought Fairchild\u2019s assets free and clear of claims and should not be responsible for ongoing liabilities of planes made by the old bankrupt company. Her campaign has said she was trying to save the new company and its 1,000 jobs. One of the opposing lawyers, James A. Hoffman of San Antonio, put it differently. \u201cHer position in our matter was that these people are simply out of luck,\u201d he said. Ms. Warren lost, but the case was later settled, and the National Transportation Safety Board ultimately ruled that the crash had not been caused by an aircraft defect. In quite a few cases, Ms. Warren came down clearly on the side of the consumer. Yet some of the case descriptions released by her campaign, seemingly written to portray Ms. Warren\u2019s work for corporate clients in the most consumer- or victim-friendly light, have prompted criticism from lawyers on opposing sides. In its responses to The New York Times, the campaign said the summaries were written in an effort to make \u201ccomplicated cases accessible while maintaining accuracy.\u201d Among the cases whose summaries have provoked criticism was the long-running bankruptcy of Cajun Electric Power Cooperative, a large nonprofit utility based in Baton Rouge, La., that provided power to 12 member cooperatives. When Cajun Electric filed for bankruptcy in 1994, a bidding war ensued for control of Cajun\u2019s assets, notably Big Cajun, a coal-fired power plant worth an estimated $1 billion. One of the bidders was SWEPCO, a utility company based in Shreveport, La. As the case went on, SWEPCO ran afoul of the court. Unknown to the other bidders, it had quietly paid $1 million in legal bills for seven of the Cajun Electric-member cooperatives supporting its bid. A federal judge ruled the payments improper, disqualifying SWEPCO\u2019s bid. That was when SWEPCO, desperate to remain in the bidding for Big Cajun, called Ms. Warren, who carried the day. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans overturned the judge\u2019s ruling, breathing new life into SWEPCO\u2019s play. But while she won the battle, SWEPCO ultimately did not capture the big prize. Louisiana Generating, known as LaGen, took over Big Cajun in 2000. Matt J. Farley, a New Orleans lawyer who represented LaGen, recently said he regarded Ms. Warren as a bankruptcy \u201cheavy hitter\u201d who had done a good job for her client. Mr. Farley, who describes himself as a political independent, said he saw a contradiction in 2012 when he first read her Senate campaign\u2019s description of her work in the Cajun Electric case: \u201cElizabeth represented a company that offered a plan to help save a bankrupt rural power cooperative.\u201d It is the same description given by her presidential campaign. Ms. Warren\u2019s client, SWEPCO, had offered lower electric rates in its proposal than the other bidders. But Mr. Farley believes that the summary is misleading. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine that Warren really believes that she was helping to save a rural power cooperative,\u201d Mr. Farley wrote in 2012 on a blog called Legal Insurrection. He added, \u201cThis was nothing more or less than high-stakes corporate litigation.\u201d The campaign\u2019s synopsis of Ms. Warren\u2019s work on the Dow Corning breast-implant case has also raised some eyebrows. \u201cThanks in part to Elizabeth\u2019s efforts, Dow Corning created a $2.35 billion fund to compensate women claiming injury,\u201d the description said. The exact nature of Ms. Warren\u2019s work for Dow is not clear. Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign said she advised Dow Chemical, the parent company, as it worked with most of the plaintiffs to defend the victims\u2019 trust fund. Some of the plaintiffs had objected to the trust. But Sybil Goldrich, a breast-implant victim and trustee for claimants in the 1995 bankruptcy case, has said Ms. Warren was \u201con the wrong side\u201d of the litigation as the company worked to contain corporate damage related to the claims. Other summaries released by the campaign omitted key details. Describing Ms. Warren\u2019s work in a 1989 Internal Revenue Service case, the summary says she worked to \u201chelp the tax court.\u201d The summary does not specify that she was retained by one of Texas\u2019s wealthiest families, the Hunts, in a tax dispute about how much various members owed to the I.R.S. after they tried to corner the silver market.",

      "author": "Kate Kelly",
      "content": "  Escalating the war of words between Wall Street and Senator Elizabeth Warren, Leon Cooperman, a billionaire money manager, denounced her recent tweet encouraging him to \u201cpitch in a bit more\u201d because of his success in life, saying she sounded like \u201ca parent chiding an ungrateful child.\u201d \u201cHowever much it resonates with your base, your vilification of the rich is misguided,\u201d wrote Mr. Cooperman, the billionaire manager of the Omega Family Office, in an Oct. 30 letter made public on Thursday. \u201cFor you to suggest that capitalism is a dirty word and that these people, as a group, are ingrates who didn\u2019t earn their riches \u2026 and now don\u2019t pull their weight societally indicates that you either are grossly uninformed or are knowingly warping the facts.\u201d Mr. Cooperman\u2019s letter was the culmination of weeks of long-distance tension with Ms. Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat who has styled herself as a capitalist who nevertheless wants to overhaul the excesses of Wall Street and raise taxes on the country\u2019s richest. Like many money managers and investors, Mr. Cooperman, the 76-year-old former hedge fund manager, has taken umbrage at Ms. Warren\u2019s critique of the finance industry and like others on Wall Street predicts there will be stock-market losses if she were to win the presidency. Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment to Mr. Cooperman\u2019s remarks, which were first published by CNBC.com on Thursday afternoon before going viral. But later, she wrote on Twitter: \u201cLeon is wrong. I\u2019m fighting for big changes like universal child care, investing in public schools, and free public college. We can do all of that with a #TwoCentWealth Tax. Leon can and should pitch in more\u2014so that every kid has the same opportunities he did to succeed.\u201d In an indication of their hostility to a theoretical President Warren, Wall Street donors have lavished resources on President Trump and on more moderate Democrats, including Mayor Pete Buttigieg, of South Bend, Ind., according to figures compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics. For Ms. Warren, who is now polling near the top of the Democratic primary field, attacks from Wall Street have been welcome \u2014 both as a signal of her populist credibility and as a rallying cry for small donors. In September, when CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer went on a rant about how fearful Wall Street executives were of her possible nomination, she posted the video on Twitter and responded, \u201cI\u2019m Elizabeth Warren and I approve this message.\u201d And while Ms. Warren\u2019s signature issues include ambitious structural changes like \u201cMedicare for all\u201d and combating climate change, many of her other policy ideas relate to shoring up the middle class by overhauling Wall Street. Her \u201cStop Wall Street Looting\u201d bill would curtail the freedoms of private-equity companies, for instance, and her idea to reestablish the Glass-Steagall Act would break up big banks. She has also taken aim at the wealthy, proposing among other things a so-called ultra-millionaire tax that would force households worth $50 million to $1 billion to pay 2 percent of their wealth in taxes annually. These issues have gnawed at Mr. Cooperman, who used his five-page letter to rebut some of Ms. Warren\u2019s platform. Citing entrepreneurs like the Home Depot founders Ken Langone, Bernie Marcus and Arthur Blank, and the Bloomberg media company founder and former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg, Mr. Cooperman argued that many entrepreneurs \u2014 himself included \u2014 started off with few resources and have long shared the wealth they earned with needier people. He argued that the economists advising Ms. Warren have made \u201chighly dubious assumptions,\u201d such as focusing on gross, rather than net, taxes. And he suggested that Ms. Warren should focus on income opportunity, rather than income inequality. This is not Mr. Cooperman\u2019s first attack on Ms. Warren. In a television interview on Oct. 16, he predicted that stocks would fall 25 percent if Ms. Warren were elected. On Oct. 23, he told Politico that Ms. Warren was soiling the American dream and used profane language to make his point. It was then that Ms. Warren issued her own tweet, exhorting Mr. Cooperman, whose estimated net worth is $3.2 billion: \u201cLeon, you were able to succeed because of the opportunities this country gave you. Now why don\u2019t you pitch in a bit more so everyone else has a chance at the American dream, too?\u201d Alerted to the tweet, Mr. Cooperman, who says he plans to donate most of his wealth to philanthropic causes, was offended. \u201cShe mischaracterized who I was, and I wanted to straighten her out,\u201d he said. He then began composing the letter. Ms. Warren is one of two Democratic candidates to have sworn off high-dollar fund-raisers in her presidential bid, along with Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. She previously raised money from large donors for her Senate races and transferred $10 million of those funds to seed her presidential campaign, which her rivals have increasingly begun pointing out.",

      "author": "Thomas Kaplan",
      "content": "   WASHINGTON \u2014 Senator Elizabeth Warren on Friday revealed her plan to pay for an expansive transformation of the nation\u2019s health care system, proposing huge tax increases on businesses and wealthy Americans to help cover $20.5 trillion in new federal spending. The plan represents a significant bet that enough voters will favor an approach that dismantles the current system and replaces it with \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d a government-run health insurance program. And it comes after decades in which Democrats have largely tiptoed around policy proposals that relied on major tax increases and Republicans ran on tax cuts. While the proposal allows Ms. Warren to say she is not raising taxes on the middle class, it opened her to renewed charges that her plan is too radical to pass through Congress. It represents an extraordinary embrace of the tax system to redistribute wealth and re-engineer one of the pillars of the American economy, with measures that would double her proposed wealth tax on billionaires and impose new levies on investment gains and even stock trades. \u201cThis debate has moved so far and so fast within the Democratic Party, it makes your head spin,\u201d said Larry Levitt, the executive vice president for health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation. \u201cIdeas that used to be political third rails are now being proposed by one of the leading candidates for president.\u201d Ms. Warren, of Massachusetts, is not the only Democratic presidential candidate envisioning a large new government program funded by tax increases. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Ms. Warren\u2019s top rival in the party\u2019s progressive wing, is the architect of Medicare for all and has also proposed sweeping changes. Together they are presenting a profoundly different vision from the one Democrats promoted as recently as the mid-1990s when President Bill Clinton declared in a State of the Union address that \u201cthe era of big government is over.\u201d While President Barack Obama pushed through the Affordable Care Act and managed to bring down the number of uninsured, he preserved a major role for the private sector in the country\u2019s health insurance system.  Under Ms. Warren\u2019s plan, private health insurance \u2014 which now covers most of the population \u2014 would be eliminated and replaced by free government health coverage for all Americans. That is a fundamental shift from a market-driven system that has defined health care in the United States for decades but produced vast inequities in quality, service and cost. Ms. Warren would pay for the new federal spending, $20.5 trillion over 10 years, through a mix of sources, including: Beyond the $20.5 trillion total, she is also counting on states and local governments to contribute an additional $6.1 trillion to help pay for the system. Like Mr. Sanders, Ms. Warren would essentially eliminate medical costs for individuals, including premiums, deductibles and other out-of-pocket expenses. But it is not clear if her plan would cover the costs of free health care for everyone. It relies on ambitious assumptions about how much it can lower payments to hospitals, doctors and pharmaceutical companies, and how cheaply such a large system could be run. Several economists have said providing free health care would cost trillions more over a decade. \u201cWe made different assumptions, because we didn\u2019t think these kinds of assumptions were realistic,\u201d said Linda Blumberg, a health economist at the Urban Institute, whose detailed assessment of Medicare for all found it would require $34 trillion in added federal spending. As Ms. Warren has risen steadily in the polls, with strong support from liberals excited about her ambitious policy plans, she has been under pressure from top rivals like former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. to release details about paying for health care. She has been asked over and over whether she would raise taxes on the middle class to pay for it, but had not answered directly until now. Her lack of specificity became a vulnerability as the primary race heated up, especially because she had established herself as the candidate with a plan for everything. Democratic rivals like Mr. Biden and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., who prefer building on the existing system of health coverage, have pointedly criticized her on the issue, with Mr. Buttigieg calling her \u201cextremely evasive.\u201d Two weeks ago, with no sign that the pressure would relent, she announced she would soon release her own financing plan. \u201cA key step in winning the public debate over Medicare for all will be explaining what this plan costs \u2014 and how to pay for it,\u201d Ms. Warren wrote in her plan. To do that, she added, \u201cWe don\u2019t need to raise taxes on the middle class by one penny.\u201d But whether such a detailed plan will end up as a strength or a liability is unknown, and represents a gamble for a candidate who has stirred doubts about her electability among establishment Democrats. Some in the party believe that concerns about income inequality and corporate greed have become such a powerful motivator that her stance will win her converts. Others say such a strong alignment with Medicare for all will haunt her if she gets to the general election. \u201cThis is not a symbolic proposal,\u201d Mr. Levitt said. \u201cThis is the most specific plan for Medicare for all that\u2019s ever been proposed by a candidate.\u201d \u201cCandidates often pivot to the center on issues in the general election,\u201d he added. \u201cThis proposal will make it more difficult for Warren to do that on health care.\u201d For Ms. Warren to achieve her desired health care transformation, she would need to persuade Congress to pass far-reaching legislation, an enormous political challenge and a virtual impossibility unless Democrats win control of the Senate. Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign quickly criticized Ms. Warren\u2019s plan as \u201cunrealistic.\u201d \u201cThe mathematical gymnastics in this plan are all geared towards hiding a simple truth from voters: It\u2019s impossible to pay for Medicare for all without middle-class tax increases,\u201d Kate Bedingfield, a deputy campaign manager for Mr. Biden, said in a statement. In an interview with \u201cPBS NewsHour,\u201d Mr. Biden said of Ms. Warren\u2019s plan, \u201cShe\u2019s making it up.\u201d Speaking to reporters in Des Moines, Ms. Warren rebuffed criticism of her proposal, saying: \u201cDemocrats are not going to win by repeating Republican talking points and by dusting off the points of view of the giant insurance companies and the giant drug companies who don\u2019t want to see any change in the law that will bite into their profits.\u201d She said anyone defending the profits of the insurance and drug companies was \u201crunning in the wrong presidential primary.\u201d The Republican National Committee described Ms. Warren\u2019s plan as a \u201cfairy tale,\u201d adding that it would have the effect of \u201cbankrupting the country and hurting the quality of care.\u201d The comments sent a signal of how President Trump and Republicans would portray her: as a tax-and-spend liberal who wants to vastly expand the role of the federal government while abolishing private health insurance. Her plan\u2019s price tag is equal to roughly one-third of what the federal government is currently projected to spend over the next decade in total. Still, the idea of government-run health insurance excites many liberal voters. Mr. Sanders has long championed single-payer health care, and Ms. Warren has aligned herself with him on the issue. A New York Times/Siena College poll released Friday found that about three-quarters of likely Democratic caucusgoers in Iowa supported creating a single-payer system, while about nine in 10 supported the creation of an optional government plan that any American could buy. Asked whether they would be likelier to support a candidate who promises to replace the existing health care system with Medicare for all or a candidate who promises to improve the current system, likely caucusgoers said by a 14-point margin that they preferred the second option. Ms. Warren\u2019s proposal shows just how large a reorganization of spending Medicare for all represents. By eliminating private health insurance and bringing every American into a federal system, trillions of dollars of spending by households, employers and state governments would be transferred into the federal budget over the course of a decade. Ms. Warren tries to minimize fiscal disruption by asking the big payers in the current system to keep paying. Her tax on employers is meant to replace the amount that companies now pay directly to health insurers. (Small businesses would be exempt if they are not currently paying for their employees\u2019 health care.) She has also proposed that states pay the federal government what they currently spend to cover state workers and low-income residents under the Medicaid program. But to help replace an estimated $11 trillion in health care spending that would be borne by American households over a decade \u2014 on premiums, deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs \u2014 Ms. Warren lays out a series of new taxes on corporations and wealthy people. She would raise $3 trillion in total from two proposals to tax the richest Americans. She has previously said that her wealth tax proposal would impose a 3 percent annual tax on net worth over $1 billion; she would now raise that to 6 percent. For the top 1 percent of households, she would tax investment gains annually instead of when the investments are sold. Ms. Warren is also counting on stronger tax enforcement to bring in more than $2 trillion in taxes that would otherwise go uncollected, as well as $800 billion in cuts to military spending. And she is banking on passing an overhaul of immigration laws \u2014 which itself would be a huge political feat \u2014 and gaining revenue from additional taxes paid by immigrants. Ms. Warren\u2019s plan would put substantial downward pressure on payments to hospitals, doctors and pharmaceutical companies. She expects that an aggressive negotiation system could lower spending on generic medications by 30 percent compared with what Medicare pays now, for example, and spending on brand-name prescription drugs could fall by 70 percent. Payments to hospitals would be 10 percent higher on average than what Medicare pays now, a rate that would make some hospitals whole but would lead to big reductions for others. She would reduce doctors\u2019 pay to the prices Medicare pays now, with additional reductions for specialists, and small increases to doctors who provide primary care.",

      "author": "Astead W. Herndon",
      "content": "  ATLANTA \u2014 One day after a televised debate featuring significant exchanges about race, Democratic presidential candidates fanned out across this capital of black political power to pitch their message to black voters and send a clear signal: Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. should not take support from African-Americans for granted. Mr. Biden\u2019s strength with black voters has been a key force in helping him maintain a polling edge in the race, even as the candidacies of Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont ascended among progressives. But on Thursday, both challengers \u2014 as well as Senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, two black candidates in the race, and other contenders \u2014 made explicit appeals about how they would address concerns and priorities of black voters. Ms. Warren, who is Mr. Biden\u2019s leading rival in many state and national polls, took direct aim at his reliance on black support by delivering one of her biggest speeches of the campaign, describing how governments and powerful corporations use racism and racial injustice as a wedge to divide working-class people. And she argued that it was time for the nation\u2019s policies to include specific correctives to address discrimination. \u201cDon\u2019t talk about race-neutral laws,\u201d she said at a rally on Thursday evening at Clark Atlanta University, a historically black institution. \u201cThe federal government helped create the racial divide in this country through decades of active, state-sponsored discrimination, and that means the federal government has a responsibility to fix it.\u201d \u201cThe rich and the powerful want us to be afraid of each other,\u201d Ms. Warren told the crowd. \u201cAnd why? Because they are afraid of us. Afraid of our numbers. Afraid of seeing us stand together.\u201d Ms. Warren also spoke directly to white voters, and pushed back on the notion that racial equity comes at the cost of white Americans. \u201cI just want to speak directly to the question on some white people\u2019s minds when we talk about the need to address what our government has done in black communities: the uncomfortable question of, \u2018What will this mean for me?\u2019\u201d Ms. Warren said. \u201cThe truth is, when we come together, we can all move forward.\u201d Ms. Warren\u2019s speech was a thematic continuation of her rally in New York City in September, when she used the Triangle shirtwaist factory fire of 1911 to tell a story of government regulation and the political power of women\u2019s voices. In her speech on Thursday Ms. Warren leaned on history again, citing the black women-led strike of Atlanta washerwomen in 1881. Ms. Warren was introduced by Representative Ayanna S. Pressley of Massachusetts, the black lawmaker who has become one of Ms. Warren\u2019s top surrogates after her recent endorsement. Ms. Pressley helped Ms. Warren calm a group of pro-charter school protesters who disrupted her speech. Earlier that day, several other candidates also targeted black voters, speaking at a breakfast held by the Rev. Al Sharpton\u2019s National Action Network. Ms. Harris attended a \u201cblack women power breakfast\u201d with several of Atlanta\u2019s leading black women professionals. And Mr. Sanders also held a rally on the campus of a historically black college. At Morehouse College, standing near a statue of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Mr. Sanders invoked his own background in a pitch to black voters. As a Jewish man whose family escaped Nazi Germany, he learned about the cruelties of racism through his family\u2019s stories of fleeing discrimination, he said. \u201cA lot of people in my father\u2019s family did not make it out of Poland, and they were murdered by the father of white supremacy, Adolf Hitler,\u201d he said. Black voters are an important constituency in the Democratic Party, and the candidate who has won a majority of the black vote has almost always gone on to be the party\u2019s nominee. But in a race with multiple black candidates and with white candidates promising policies specifically addressing racial inequities, the diversity of the black electorate \u2014 with respect to age, gender, education levels and ideology \u2014 has been on display. Still, it has been difficult for candidates to wrest black support away from Mr. Biden. He has been buttressed by sky-high name recognition, association with former President Barack Obama and his promise that he is best suited to win the white working-class voters who helped deliver the last election to President Trump. On Thursday, Mr. Biden met with a group of black mayors, including Keisha Lance Bottoms of Atlanta, who has endorsed him, before leaving for a town hall event in South Carolina, an early primary state where he leads in the polls. Speaking to reporters in Atlanta, Mr. Biden cited his long relationship with the African-American community in Delaware when asked about his support among black voters. \u201cI\u2019ve always been comfortable in the community, and I think that the community\u2019s always been comfortable with me,\u201d Mr. Biden said. In Wednesday night\u2019s debate, Mr. Booker criticized Mr. Biden for his opposition to legalizing marijuana, noting that black marijuana users are more frequently penalized than white ones. \u201cBlack voters are pissed off and they\u2019re worried,\u201d Mr. Booker said, adding that while he had \u201ca lot of respect\u201d for Mr. Biden, \u201cthis week I hear him literally say that \u2018I don\u2019t think we should legalize marijuana.\u2019\u201d Looking directly at Mr. Biden, Mr. Booker said, \u201cI thought you might have been high when you said it.\u201d At a ministers\u2019 breakfast meeting sponsored by the National Action Network, Mr. Booker continued his pitch a day later as the best candidate to address racial inequities in the economy and criminal justice. \u201cThe black-white wealth gap is growing. The leading cause of death for African-American boys and men is murder,\u201d Mr. Booker said. \u201cWe are at a point now that there\u2019s more African-Americans under criminal supervision than all the slaves in 1850.\u201d In impassioned remarks colored with scripture, Mr. Booker said the country needed to \u201censure that the next president of the United States doesn\u2019t have an academic appreciation of these issues, but actually has a passion, has an instinctual connection \u2014 is someone that we can trust to bring these issues to the front and center of the national agenda.\u201d A number of other candidates also toured Atlanta, making a concerted pitch to black voters. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., the entrepreneur Andrew Yang and the billionaire former hedge fund manager Tom Steyer attended Mr. Sharpton\u2019s breakfast, too. Mr. Buttigieg sought to establish common ground with the black audience, pointing out that, as a gay man, he had benefited from black activism during the civil rights movement. But he has struggled to build support among this constituency. A recent South Carolina poll showed he is the choice of fewer than 1 percent of black likely Democratic voters there. Ms. Harris held a morning breakfast event for black women in Atlanta. Though her candidacy has fallen from its once front-runner status, Ms. Harris made clear that she remains the only black woman in the race, and pitched herself as someone who can uniquely understand black communities. Ms. Harris said her criminal justice record was better than those of the race\u2019s white front-runners. \u201cThere are people on that debate stage who wrote the crime bill, who voted for the crime bill and who have not had the language to know what this is about until just the last couple years. Are you kidding me?\u201d Ms. Harris said. \u201cWhere were these folks when I was creating a national model around what we need to do to end mass incarceration and the war on drugs?\u201d At the debate, Mr. Biden touted his support among black voters, saying, \u201cI come out of the black community in terms of my support.\u201d But then he mistakenly said he had the endorsement of the \u201conly African-American woman that had ever been elected to the United States Senate.\u201d He was apparently referring to former Senator Carol Moseley Braun of Illinois \u2014 the first black woman to become a senator. He failed to mention Ms. Harris, the second black woman elected to the Senate, who was standing on the same stage.",

      "author": "Abby Goodnough",
      "content": "   WASHINGTON \u2014 Senator Elizabeth Warren vowed on Friday to pass major health care legislation in her first 100 days as president, unveiling a new, detailed plan to significantly expand public health insurance coverage as a first step, and promising to pass a \u201cMedicare for all\u201d system by the end of her third year in office that would cover all Americans. The initial bill she would seek to pass if elected would be a step short of the broader Medicare for all plan she has championed. But it would substantially expand the reach and generosity of public health insurance, creating a government plan that would offer free coverage to all American children and people earning less than double the federal poverty rate, or about $50,000 for a family of four, and that could be purchased by other Americans who want it. Ms. Warren has long endorsed a Medicare for all bill sponsored by one of her rivals for the Democratic nomination, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. But until now, she has not specified how quickly she would move to enact a health care plan. Friday\u2019s proposal amounts to a detailed road map for eventually establishing Medicare for all, a single government-run health insurance program under which private coverage would be eliminated. That goal \u2014 a wholesale transformation of how Americans receive health insurance \u2014 is a big political gamble, particularly given that many of them would have to give up the coverage they get through their employers. Ms. Warren\u2019s proposal for Medicare for all would require an estimated $20.5 trillion in new federal spending over a decade, according to a financing plan she released two weeks ago. To provide funding for it, she would impose new taxes on businesses and the richest Americans. But under the plan she presented on Friday, she would not seek passage of a single-payer system early in her presidency. The proposal would instead move people into that system gradually \u2014 in a way she hopes would build public support for full-fledged Medicare for all \u2014 while temporarily preserving the employer-based insurance system that covers most working-age adults today. \u201cI believe the next president must do everything she can within one presidential term to complete the transition to Medicare for all,\u201d Ms. Warren, of Massachusetts, wrote in her plan. \u201cMy plan will reduce the financial and political power of the insurance companies \u2014 as well as their ability to frighten the American people \u2014 by implementing reforms immediately and demonstrating at each phase that true Medicare for all coverage is better than their private options. I believe this approach gives us our best chance to succeed.\u201d Though the details differ, Ms. Warren\u2019s transition plan shares many features with health care proposals from her more moderate rivals for the nomination, including Joseph R. Biden Jr., the former vice president, and Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind. For example, it would allow higher-income adults to voluntarily sign up for a new public plan. Ms. Warren\u2019s proposal, however, would make the optional government plan more generous than those proposed by her rivals, and would allow more Americans to get it free. It would also let anyone over 50 buy Medicare coverage, with more benefits than the program offers now. With her interim plan, Ms. Warren is attempting to offer something attractive to both sides of the Democratic health care debate: preserving her commitment to the single-payer vision that energizes voters on the left, while offering a less disruptive set of proposals in the short term to those who may be reluctant to give up their existing coverage. But her choice to put off seeking passage of a full-scale Medicare for all plan until as late as her third year in office could draw criticism from liberals eager to put in place a single-payer system as quickly as possible. \u201cNow, some people say we should delay that fight for a few more years,\u201d Mr. Sanders said on Friday as he discussed Medicare for all and the opponents who would try to stop it. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. We\u2019re ready to take them on right now, and we\u2019re going to take them on on Day 1.\u201d And on Twitter, he offered his own pledge about the beginning of his presidency: \u201cIn my first week as president, we will introduce Medicare for All legislation.\u201d Representative Pramila Jayapal, Democrat of Washington, who has introduced Medicare for all legislation in the House, praised Ms. Warren\u2019s plan as \u201cone smart approach\u201d that \u201cgets us to Medicare for all that covers everyone with comprehensive care in four years.\u201d Ms. Warren\u2019s plan reflects a sense of pragmatism about the politics and logistics of passing a major health bill through a closely divided Congress. Ms. Warren said she would pass the transition plan using special procedures that would require only a simple majority in the Senate, rather than the 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster. But she would still rely on Democrats winning control of the Senate, where Republicans currently hold a slim majority. And she is laying out ambitious details for getting to a single-payer system even as voter support for the idea is narrowing; polls suggest substantially more Americans prefer the \u201cpublic option\u201d type of plans that Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg have proposed. Kate Bedingfield, a deputy campaign manager for Mr. Biden, said Ms. Warren was \u201ctrying to muddy the waters even further\u201d after \u201chaving discovered how problematic her embrace of Medicare for all has become.\u201d \u201cWhat started out as \u2018mathematical gymnastics\u2019 have been replaced by a full program of flips and twists covering every element of her plan,\u201d she said, adding that the transition plan \u201cdoesn\u2019t change the reality that Medicare for all will deny Americans the right to choose their insurance by eliminating employer-sponsored insurance.\u201d Passing a health bill could crowd out other legislative priorities. President Trump\u2019s efforts to repeal and replace major parts of the Affordable Care Act in 2017 stretched well beyond his first 100 days and ultimately failed. And given the unpredictable nature of politics, a pledge to pass comprehensive Medicare for all legislation by the end of 2023 represents a somewhat distant goal. \u201cI think that it\u2019s really unnecessary and potentially dangerous to try to split up something like Medicare for all into multiple bills,\u201d said Dr. Adam Gaffney, the president of Physicians for a National Health Program, a group of doctors that supports a single-payer health care system. But he said he was pleased Ms. Warren was still advocating Medicare for all. When Ms. Warren laid out her plan to finance a Medicare for all system earlier this month, she said that she would not increase taxes on middle-class families by \u201cone penny.\u201d Among other revenue sources, Ms. Warren would require employers to pay an amount similar to what they are currently spending on their employees\u2019 health care, and she would raise taxes on the richest Americans, including by steepening her proposed wealth tax for billionaires. Her transition plan did not come with its own detailed financing proposal, but it said the interim program would cost the federal government less than an eventual Medicare for all system and would be funded using some mix of the revenue sources she has already identified. The plan also spells out a long list of administrative actions Ms. Warren would take to change the health care system, even if Democrats do not retake the Senate. She would roll back Trump administration regulations that have weakened the Affordable Care Act and broaden benefits in the existing Medicare program. She would also use executive authority to allow new generic versions of expensive drugs \u2014 such as insulins taken by patients with diabetes, treatments for hepatitis C and the overdose reversal drug Naloxone \u2014 in an effort to lower their prices. As Ms. Warren has established herself as a leading candidate for the Democratic nomination, her opponents have frequently attacked her over health care, a top issue in the primary. For much of the fall, her refusal to say whether she would raise taxes on the middle class provided an opening for some of her rivals to paint her as cagey on a key issue. Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg have also argued their public option proposals are far more realistic than Ms. Warren\u2019s plan for Medicare for all, emphasizing that her plan would take away people\u2019s private health coverage. Lis Smith, a senior adviser for Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s campaign, described Ms. Warren\u2019s transition plan as \u201ca transparently political attempt to paper over a very serious policy problem, which is that she wants to force 150 million people off their private insurance \u2014 whether they like it or not.\u201d In the longer term, Ms. Warren\u2019s embrace of Medicare for all would provide ammunition to Mr. Trump and his Republican allies if she became the Democratic nominee. Mr. Trump is already fond of equating Democratic approaches to health care with socialism. Ms. Warren is a co-sponsor of Mr. Sanders\u2019s Medicare for all legislation, which includes a four-year transition. Though his legislation is best known for its endpoint, it includes a detailed plan for moving from the current health care system to that final goal. But Mr. Sanders\u2019s transition relies on passing his entire plan. Ms. Warren, by contrast, has suggested splitting the process in two: starting with the transition plan and only later passing a full Medicare for all bill. And Mr. Sanders, unlike Ms. Warren, has declined to specify a detailed financing plan for his proposal.",

      "content": " VINTON, Iowa \u2014 Elizabeth Warren motors onstage at her campaign events like she is being chased: arm-pump, arm-pump, mid-jog wave. O.K.! Let\u2019s get this thing going. She rockets through the plan-a-minute portion of her stump speech with a winking plea for indulgence: \u201cJust one more, just one more,\u201d she promises, as if bargaining with an award-show orchestra trying to play her off before her subprime mortgage riff. Then comes that crucial moment of a Warren gathering, when the power dynamic shifts from the stage to the crowd. Someone has a question. Ms. Warren has staked her 2020 candidacy on having the answers. And from her opening syllables \u2014 \u201cO.K.!\u201d, \u201cAlrighty!\u201d, \u201cSo!\u201d \u2014 she takes care to project a problem-solving itch so irrepressible that only comic-book punctuation will suffice. \u201cWhoooaaaaa!\u201d Ms. Warren said on a recent Saturday in Vinton, joined by 150 people inside a high school atrium. A woman, Jan Bingham, 64, had just asked about the thorny subject of \u201celectability,\u201d at once a trope long used to diminish female candidates and a source of near-constant anxiety among Warren supporters. \u201cIt has been said that Elizabeth Warren has a plan for everything,\u201d Ms. Bingham said, \u201cexcept how to beat Donald Trump.\u201d \u201cAll right!\u201d Ms. Warren replied, over audience grumbles. She plowed through a familiar bit about turning back bullies, about knowing what\u2019s broken and knowing how to fix it. Polite applause followed. Ms. Bingham sat down. \u201cI guess I wanted a few more specifics,\u201d she said. With less than three months before the voting begins, Ms. Warren has, in some ways, already completed the knottiest leg of her would-be path to the Democratic presidential nomination. Saddled early on by halting fund-raising totals, middling poll numbers and a running flap over claims of Native American ancestry, she managed to elevate herself above the primary morass behind a fire hose of policy plans and the canny celebri-fication of a septuagenarian bankruptcy expert who campaigns in sneakers and cardigans, smiling into any cellphone camera pointed at her until the photo line is bare. Now it gets harder. After nearly a year of slowly, and then not so slowly, rising to the top of the pack, Ms. Warren is facing her first period of apparent plateau \u2014 her momentum stalled, according to polls and dozens of voter interviews, amid nagging doubts like Ms. Bingham\u2019s and the predictable price of success: even more scrutiny. Rank-and-file Democrats have raised concerns about the viability of her Medicare for all proposal. They smirk at some well-placed trolling \u2014 a \u201cBillionaire Tears\u201d coffee mug quickly became a campaign best seller \u2014 but worry about the blowback that some of her soak-the-rich platform has inspired. An unmemorable debate performance Wednesday night in Atlanta seems unlikely to advance Ms. Warren\u2019s cause much. In recent weeks, two prospective rivals, former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York and former Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts, appeared so unimpressed with the strength of the Democratic candidates as Ms. Warren climbed that a historically large primary field has begun growing again. Supporters are wary of the toll on Ms. Warren as more moderate peers like former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., escalate their attacks. And though Ms. Warren turns often to the language of political combat \u2014 the word \u201cfight,\u201d or some variation, appears three times combined in the titles of her last two books \u2014 she has rarely hit back at her leading competitors with much force. \u201cI\u2019m not here to criticize other Democrats,\u201d she told reporters, at least twice, after filing for the New Hampshire primary at the state house in Concord last week. She spoke instead about being the daughter of a janitor. Counteracting these headwinds, admirers say, is nearly a year\u2019s worth of evidence that Ms. Warren is doing something different and durable, that the sum total of the plans and the persistence and the 85,000 photos with fans is a campaign built to withstand semi-lulls like this. The question may be simple in the end, as it has been for the last two presidents \u2014 and the many talented and formidable opponents whom they bested: Is Ms. Warren a phenomenon? A candidate magnetic enough to make believers out of even those typically disinclined to bother with democracy? Or is she merely another skilled candidate in a flawed field? \u201cI want to believe,\u201d said Carrie Mirfield, a 47-year-old massage therapist, before an event in Davenport. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if I do yet.\u201d Of course, the trouble with phenomenon-candidacies is that you don\u2019t know until you know. Did it feel preordained with Barack Obama in November 2007? With Donald Trump eight years later? Clearly something was happening. But could anyone be sure how it might scale? Ms. Warren plainly has a gift for making her charges feel like part of a grander mission, for connecting her story to their own. Allies have long believed that if voters could see her as Betsy from Oklahoma, and not Liz from Harvard, she would have a fighting chance. She prefers \u201cteacher\u201d to \u201cprofessor\u201d \u2014 and rarely uses the H-word \u2014 reminding crowds of her penchant for instructing and grading her childhood \u201cdollies.\u201d \u201cI had a reputation for being tough but fair,\u201d she says, every time. Her stump speech is specked with a kind of knowing prairie humor: how she was referred to only as \u201cthe surprise\u201d after her birth; how only one of her three older brothers is a Democrat (\u201cdo the math\u201d); how her first husband came to be called \u201cH-1\u201d after the fact. \u201cHint,\u201d she likes to say. \u201cIt is never a good sign when you have to number your husbands.\u201d The room falls quietest as she tells the tale of her childhood finances in Oklahoma: her father\u2019s heart attack, losing the family station wagon, her mother \u2014 50 years old, without work experience outside the home \u2014 pulling on a black dress to interview for a job answering phones at Sears. Ms. Mirfield, the skeptical voter in Davenport, said after the event that the Sears story had steeled her to support Ms. Warren after all. Her team likewise tends toward true believers, dressed in \u201cliberty green\u201d campaign gear and liable to slip phrases like \u201cstructural change\u201d and \u201cin this fight\u201d into casual conversation. Even those closest to Ms. Warren appear skittish about going off-script. After attending an event of hers in Muscatine, Iowa \u2014 where the candidate talked about her dollies and the Koch brothers and made it all cohere \u2014 Ms. Warren\u2019s son, Alex, fell into conversation with a voter. \u201cThis is genuinely who she is,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is how she sounds.\u201d Approached the next morning by a reporter, he offered similarly generic praise for his mother before insisting his remarks were off the record. While some other campaigns have empowered aides to speak frequently on cable news about their candidate, Ms. Warren\u2019s operation almost never dispatches a staff member to represent her on television. The closest approximation during her Iowa swing may have been a \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d impression, airing above a bar in Dubuque where aides had gathered after her last event of the day, lampooning the costs of Ms. Warren\u2019s plans. \u201cAll we gotta do is convince JP Morgan to operate like a nonprofit,\u201d Kate McKinnon\u2019s Ms. Warren said, adding, \u201cWhen the numbers are this big, they\u2019re just pretend.\u201d Such gentle yuks are a small tax to pay for the mainstream relevance that Ms. Warren has earned. She seems to have grasped some superficial lessons from the last two presidents: As the first White House victors of the smartphone era, Mr. Obama and Mr. Trump each succeeded as a kind of lifestyle brand, their campaigns experienced in viral video snippets and projected across social media by supporters eager to share pictures of themselves, and their candidate, and themselves with their candidate. Voters know the name of Ms. Warren\u2019s golden retriever (Bailey). They chant the tagline of her wealth tax proposal (\u201ctwo cents!\u201d) as if they are requesting a song at a concert. They shell out money for campaign merchandise, like a \u201cPurr-sist\u201d cat collar, and less official wares like a skull-centric \u201cEAT THE RICH\u201d T-shirt sold outside her events by an unaffiliated vendor. \u201cNo other candidate has ever done this,\u201d Wade Snowden, 23, said of the photo line, as he waited his turn in Vinton. That this is untrue \u2014 candidates have done post-event photos with all comers for years \u2014 can feel almost irrelevant. \u201cI was there when she was polling at 6 percent, and it was like, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s so cute you\u2019re running,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Snowden, whose T-shirt captured a screenshot of Ms. Warren\u2019s facial expression from an old video stream as she read a message from him. \u201cNow she\u2019s, like, the front-runner.\u201d Some veterans of Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign have been impressed with Ms. Warren\u2019s ability to play to her advantages, making white-paper gravitas look hipper, somehow, than Mrs. Clinton ever seemed to. \u201cHer campaign is doing something that she is an extremely unlikely heroine for, which is creating a celebrity around her,\u201d said Jess Morales Rocketto, a Democratic strategist and former aide to Mrs. Clinton, comparing the effort to the popular legends constructed around Mr. Obama or Bernie Sanders. Ms. Morales Rocketto suggested that the combination of Ms. Warren\u2019s plans and her social media ubiquity \u2014 tormenting billionaires, surprising small-dollar donors with phone calls \u2014 had established \u201ca very important permission structure to say \u2018I can support her\u2019 and \u2014 and this is crucial in 2019 \u2014 \u2018it is cool to support her.\u2019\u201d Other data points are more cautionary. Ms. Warren\u2019s crowd sizes can register as more respectable than staggering, not bad for a cold-weather spell months before the voting starts but hardly imposing in a field with several candidates, from Mr. Sanders and Mr. Buttigieg to the former tech executive Andrew Yang, who can reliably fill event halls themselves. In polls, Ms. Warren still struggles with nonwhite voters and those without college degrees. On the trail, where the most engaged voters often sound and behave like pundits, she has drawn skepticism from a peculiar class of Democrat: the progressive who fears others are not so progressive. \u201cIf she isn\u2019t willing to moderate some of her views, I don\u2019t think she can beat Trump,\u201d said Jim Butler, 73, a retired teacher from Dubuque wearing a \u201cNevertheless, She Persisted\u201d shirt. \u201cShe scares some people. Doesn\u2019t scare me, I\u2019m as progressive as she is. But I\u2019m not sure she can change people\u2019s views as fast as she needs to change them.\u201d Ms. Warren\u2019s standard remarks now seem to anticipate this argument. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to give up on big ideas,\u201d she said at an outdoor rally in Concord last week, her breath visible after certain punctuated syllables on a 25-degree afternoon. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to sound so sophisticated when you do.\u201d But if you abandon your big ideas, she suggested, what have you won if you win? Hours later, at a forum for union members a short walk away, Ms. Warren put it like this: \u201cI\u2019m not running for president so I get to try on the outfit.\u201d It was the question-and-answer portion, and hands were shooting up inside a hotel conference room. A woman stood to ask about Medicare for all, sounding anxious about Ms. Warren\u2019s proposal. The candidate nodded. \u201cGood!\u201d she began. \u201cSo, I appreciate the question.\u201d",

      "author": "Jacey Fortin",
      "content": " Senator Elizabeth Warren on Wednesday invited the billionaire Bill Gates to meet so she could allay his worries about her plans to raise taxes on the wealthy and explain \u201cexactly how much\u201d he would pay. Speaking with the columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin at The New York Times DealBook Conference on Wednesday, Mr. Gates, the Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist whose fortune totals over $100 billion, said that he had paid over $10 billion in taxes and that it would be \u201cfine\u201d if he had to pay $20 billion. \u201cBut, you know, when you say I should pay $100 billion, O.K., then I\u2019m starting to do a little math about what I have left over,\u201d he added. \u201cSorry, I\u2019m just kidding. So you really want the incentive system to be there and you can go a long ways without threatening that.\u201d [Speaking at the same conference, Hillary Clinton voiced skepticism of a wealth tax.] Mr. Sorkin then asked Mr. Gates if he had ever spoken about this with Ms. Warren \u2014 he said he had not \u2014 and asked Mr. Gates if he would want to. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m not sure how open-minded she is, or that she\u2019d even be willing to sit down with somebody, you know, who has large amounts of money,\u201d Mr. Gates said. Ms. Warren responded with a tweet on Wednesday evening. \u201cI\u2019m always happy to meet with people, even if we have different views,\u201d she said, tagging Mr. Gates directly. \u201cIf we get the chance, I\u2019d love to explain exactly how much you\u2019d pay under my wealth tax. (I promise it\u2019s not $100 billion.)\u201d For Ms. Warren, who has made battling corporate greed and corruption a central theme of her campaign and is now among the top contenders in the Democratic primary field, attacks from Wall Street and public clashes with billionaires have been welcomed as signs of her populist credibility and reformatory zeal. Her proposals include a 2 percent tax on household net worth over $50 million. She outlined a plan last week to pay for \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d which calls for $20.5 trillion in new federal spending over a decade, by increasing her proposed wealth tax on net worth above $1 billion to 6 percent annually and raising taxes on investment gains for the top 1 percent of households. This week, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the other top-polling contender for the Democratic presidential nomination, unleashed a new line of attacks against Ms. Warren, seeking to paint her as an elitist who believes people lack wisdom or courage unless they agree with her. Ms. Warren\u2019s team has been critical of Mr. Biden\u2019s reliance on high-dollar fund-raising events. The two candidates are on opposite sides of a party divide that pits the structural changes favored by more left-leaning front-runners like Ms. Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont against a more moderate approach that speaks to values of unity and bipartisanship, which Mr. Biden espouses. Mr. Gates, a Harvard dropout, is a chairman of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the world\u2019s largest charitable organization. The foundation has directed billions of dollars annually toward efforts to combat malaria, reduce poverty and improve education. Mr. Gates has expressed worries about President Trump\u2019s foreign aid policies and his style of communication. He has also spoken in defiance of federal regulation before. In 1998, Mr. Gates testified in Congress to defend Microsoft when lawmakers questioned whether the company was abusing its market power. He argued that technological process could happen \u201cif innovation is not restricted by government.\u201d That appearance was mirrored by the congressional testimony last month of another tech industry titan, Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook. Mr. Zuckerberg, who struck a more conciliatory tone in front of Congress than Mr. Gates did, has criticized Ms. Warren\u2019s plan to break up tech giants. Ms. Warren has also clashed publicly with the billionaire Leon Cooperman, a hedge fund manager who wrote an open letter to the senator last month.  He disagreed with Ms. Warren\u2019s critique of the finance industry and predicted stock-market losses if she were to win the presidency. As with Mr. Gates, Ms. Warren responded with a tweet. \u201cLeon is wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m fighting for big changes like universal child care, investing in public schools, and free public college. We can do all of that with a #TwoCentWealth Tax. Leon can and should pitch in more \u2014 so that every kid has the same opportunities he did to succeed.\u201d",

But the expansive $20.5 trillion package could come to define her candidacy anyway.By Shane Goldmacher, Sarah Kliff and Thomas KaplanPRINT EDITIONHow Warren Found a Focus In Health Care|November 18, 2019, Page A1",
      "author": "Shane Goldmacher",
      "content": "   Two days before Senator Elizabeth Warren rolled out a fundamental reimagining of America\u2019s health care and tax system \u2014 a $20.5 trillion package that would dwarf all her previous plans combined \u2014 she was working the phones to personally preview her proposal and sell it to a select group of political influencers. One was Paul Krugman, the Nobel Prize-winning economist and New York Times columnist, who had written skeptically days earlier that her plan to pay for \u201cMedicare for all\u201d was a \u201cmake-or-break moment\u201d for her, if not the whole 2020 race. Another call was to Representative Pramila Jayapal, the lead sponsor of Medicare for all legislation in the House and a leading liberal as the co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. \u201cPramila,\u201d Ms. Warren told her, \u201cwe\u2019re gonna do this.\u201d She would soon need every ally possible: Ms. Warren\u2019s announcement of her Medicare for all financing package is perhaps the riskiest political bet of her campaign. Her Democratic rivals have attacked her plan as unfeasible and some voters worry that it is too radical. Ms. Warren would guarantee government health coverage to every American for the first time, erase the existing system of private insurance that currently covers more than 170 million people and pay for it with huge new taxes on corporations and the wealthy but not, her campaign claimed, with \u201cone penny\u201d from the middle class. The sprawling plan is the culmination of Ms. Warren\u2019s yearslong journey toward a full embrace of Medicare for all and a clear sign that she believes her path to the Democratic nomination, and her party\u2019s to the White House, is through full-throated liberalism. And yet the politics of health care have always been thorny \u2014 they powered the Democratic takeover of the House in 2018 and the Republican wave in 2010. Ms. Warren appeared to nod to that reality on Friday, announcing a two-step transition plan that would give her up to three years to try to pass  Medicare for all. The twist is that health care was never supposed to define Ms. Warren\u2019s candidacy. That was Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019s signature issue. Ms. Warren had entered the race and gained momentum with a populist agenda focused on breaking up Big Tech, tackling corruption in Washington and on Wall Street, and making corporations and the wealthiest Americans pay more in taxes. But her decision to remake the health care system is now a major part of the 2020 debate, and Ms. Warren\u2019s upward momentum in the polls has stalled as her opponents have assailed her. Political strategists say the sheer scope of her plan and her support for ending private insurance threaten to subsume her candidacy. \u201cShe took most, if not all, of her chips and put them on this \u2014 and I do think it took a lot of political guts,\u201d said Chris Lehane, a veteran Democratic strategist who worked in the Clinton White House. \u201cBy going big on health care, she will either go to the White House on this issue or go home because of it.\u201d How Ms. Warren came to put together her blueprint, including her determination to avoid middle-class tax increases, offers a revealing window into the methodical way that she operates, her approach to political balancing acts and how she might govern as president. It is a story that begins with Ms. Warren researching medical bankruptcies at Harvard nearly two decades ago and ends with her as a front-runner for the Democratic nomination, rolling out a plan while under siege from her rivals for more specifics. Throughout, Ms. Warren has kept one eye trained on policy and the other on realpolitik: protecting her aspirational brand of liberalism and robbing Republicans (and her Democratic rivals) of a potent talking point about middle-class taxes. She ignored those in the Democratic establishment who had warned her against eliminating private insurance, and ultimately settled on a proposal whose math loosely adds up but that many, even within her party, see as mostly a values statement. The transition she announced Friday focuses her first 100 days on a public health insurance plan closer to what her more moderate rivals have championed \u2014 drawing instant condemnation that she was trying to have it both ways. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to beat Donald Trump next year with double talk on health care,\u201d Kate Bedingfield, a deputy campaign manager for Mr. Biden, said on Friday. The backlash seemed to ensure that Ms. Warren will face even more pressure to explain her stance in the Democratic debate in Atlanta on Wednesday. \u201cUp until putting a price tag on Medicare for all she had imposed her will on the primary and dictated the tempo on her terms,\u201d Mr. Lehane said. \u201cThis is first time that she is having to react and not follow her campaign script.\u201d Ms. Warren had a plan for everything. That was her calling card almost from the start of the race. But health care was conspicuous it its absence, all the way back to her first trip to Iowa, when she barely mentioned Medicare for all. In June, Ms. Warren simply tucked into the slipstream of her liberal rival, Mr. Sanders, on his signature issue. \u201cI\u2019m with Bernie on Medicare for all,\u201d she said at the first debate. But by fall, health care was emerging as the No. 1 issue in the campaign, and the absence of a plan was increasingly untenable. She was dogged for weeks by questions about whom she would raise taxes on, saying only that total costs for the middle class would go down. \u201cYour signature, senator, is to have a plan for everything,\u201d Mayor Pete Buttigieg took aim at the last debate. \u201cExcept this.\u201d What few people knew then was that Ms. Warren and her Boston-based team had been privately crunching numbers since at least late August, working with the internal imperative to craft a package without hiking middle-class taxes, according to interviews with people directly involved in the process. The onslaught at the debate accelerated the timeline. One academic described working so hard with Warren officials in late October that he was distracted from his teaching duties; another said she made final edits on a letter endorsing Ms. Warren\u2019s math in her car at her child\u2019s school during a Halloween parade. \u201cSyria is easier compared to this,\u201d said one Warren adviser, granted anonymity to speak about the process of crafting a plan. Kristen Orthman, Ms. Warren\u2019s communications director, said the campaign had not been and would not be buffeted by \u201cthe cable news flavor of the week.\u201d \u201cWe are running a campaign on identifying what\u2019s broken, presenting big ideas to fix it, and building a grass-roots movement to make it happen and that\u2019s exactly what we did here,\u201d Ms. Orthman said. Now Ms. Warren, who declined to be interviewed for this article, must sell her plan to a Democratic Party deeply concerned about ceding any political advantage to President Trump next fall. Skeptics of Medicare for all have ranged from Hillary Clinton to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to former President Barack Obama, who on Friday night issued a warning of his own about disrupting people\u2019s existing insurance. \u201cEighty-five percent of the country has health care,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cThey may not love it, but it roughly works for them.\u201d Kathleen Sebelius, who had a front-row seat to the health care wars of the last decade as Mr. Obama\u2019s first secretary of health and human services, sounded a similar note of caution. \u201cWe saw the Republicans very effectively demagogue the issue,\u201d she said. Even some of Ms. Warren\u2019s supporters are wary. \u201cIt still kind of scares me,\u201d said Eric Spera, a 40-year-old who attended a recent town hall in Goose Creek, S.C. \u201cI love her. I think she\u2019s the best candidate that there is. But that\u2019s the only drawback I have with her.\u201d Yet in some ways, Ms. Warren has almost proceeded as if her announcement did not happen. On the stump, she only glancingly mentions health care. And speaking to reporters the day after unveiling her Medicare for all financing plan, she uncharacteristically stumbled over the specifics, insisting, incorrectly, that only billionaires would see their taxes go up. Nearly two decades earlier, Ms. Warren was meeting with fellow Harvard researchers in her light-filled office at the university\u2019s Radcliffe Institute to pore over hundreds of accounts of how Americans went bankrupt. The same answer kept popping up: medical bills. \u201cWe started to hear things like, \u2018I have diabetes and I can\u2019t afford to save,\u2019 and older people who had no savings left because of their medical bills,\u201d said Deborah Thorne, a researcher who worked closely with Ms. Warren on the project. \u201cI do think you could have watched our views evolving then, both for Elizabeth and me.\u201d Ms. Thorne recalled one story that stood out especially: a middle-aged man who had spent hours debating with his wife about whether to go to the emergency room for a second heart attack; they were worried about the bills they could not afford to pay after the first one. \u201cBoth of us were so moved by the data and the people\u2019s experiences, it made it clear to us: This isn\u2019t working,\u201d Ms. Thorne said. \u201cSo what would?\u201d In 2008, Ms. Thorne and Ms. Warren co-wrote a book chapter where they described single-payer health care as \u201cthe most obvious solution\u201d to medical bankruptcy. A few paragraphs later though, they acknowledged that other policy options exist \u201cif single-payer health insurance is politically unacceptable.\u201d In Ms. Warren\u2019s 2012 Senate run, her lone competitive race against a Republican, she resisted endorsing a government-run health care program, saying \u201cyou\u2019ve got to stay with what\u2019s possible,\u201d an echo of what former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. now says. Four years later another member of the Harvard research team, Steffie Woolhandler, a longtime single-payer advocate, traveled to Washington to make her case for Medicare for all to Ms. Warren. But the senator demurred, saying that she would prioritize \u201csupporting the Affordable Care Act and helping Democrats hold onto the Senate\u201d in the upcoming election. But a year later, it was Ms. Warren reaching out, inviting Ms. Woolhandler to her Massachusetts home on June 19, 2017. There, over tea on an indoor porch, Ms. Warren peppered her with questions about the economics of Medicare for all. \u201cShe seemed to be thinking through the economics \u2014 essentially, why can other nations with single-payer spend no more than we do and cover everybody?\u201d Ms. Woolhandler said. Days later, she called for single-payer for the first time. And in September, she signed onto Mr. Sanders\u2019s single-payer legislation. Mr. Sanders has framed health care chiefly as a matter of human rights, a way to provide medical care to the masses. Ms. Warren focused on eliminating the medical bankruptcies she had seen in her research. Under Medicare for all, she said at the time, \u201cFamilies don\u2019t have to bear the costs of heartbreaking medical disasters on their own.\u201d But she stopped well short that day of saying it was the only way to proceed. \u201cEverything should be on the table,\u201d she said. \u201cMedicare for all is one way.\u201d The Sanders legislation represented an early 2020 ideological crossroads, not only for Ms. Warren but for much of the presidential primary field. Multiple advisers to potential candidates said the decision on whether to join with Mr. Sanders, who had made Medicare for all central to his insurgent 2016 campaign, presented one of the first sorting moments of the coming primary. \u201cThere are people who thought it was a litmus test for being able to run for president,\u201d said Senator Michael Bennet, a moderate Democrat who is using a long-shot presidential bid to warn his party about the electoral risk of Medicare for all. But long after endorsing the Sanders bill, Ms. Warren\u2019s language on Medicare for all remained fluid. In March 2019, at a CNN forum, she said there were \u201ca lot of different pathways\u201d for universal coverage, and that private insurers \u201ccould\u201d still have a role. By June, Ms. Warren was more unequivocal, raising her hand at the first presidential debate to endorse doing away with private insurers entirely. Still, she allowed herself room to maneuver, especially on how the program would be paid for. She repeatedly refused to rule out raising middle-class taxes, saying only that she would lower overall costs. The tension came to a head in a July post-debate interview, when Chris Matthews, pressed her in a live interview on MSNBC to say what would happen to taxes. Over and over, she refused to answer. By September, the headlines were everywhere: The candidate with a plan for everything did not have one for the issue at the center of the race. The tax question became so commonplace that Ms. Warren even got advice from the late-night host Stephen Colbert, who recommended she compare it to taxes for public schools. Behind the scenes, her team was already pressing to get the senator on firmer rhetorical and financial footing. Two long-serving Warren aides, Jon Donenberg and Bharat Ramamurti, were spearheading the effort to develop a financing plan over the summer, with Mr. Donenberg briefing Ms. Warren on various cost options. But the plan was not quite cooked yet by the time she stepped on the debate stage in Ohio with a bull\u2019s-eye on her back. She had just caught Mr. Biden in national polling averages for the first time, and staked out a lead in Iowa. The attacks began almost immediately. First came Mr. Buttigieg. Then Senator Amy Klobuchar (\u201cAt least Bernie\u2019s being honest here,\u201d she said). Then Mr. Biden (\u201cOn the single most important thing facing the American public,\u201d he said, \u201cI think it\u2019s awfully important to be straightforward with them.\u201d) From a hotel room thousands of miles away, Donald Berwick, a former federal health care official, had watched it unfold with growing frustration. For six weeks, he had been stealthily working with Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign to develop a comprehensive way to pay for Medicare for all. \u201cSenator Warren was under tremendous pressure,\u201d Dr. Berwick said. \u201cIt was the same question again and again: Where is your plan? Where is your plan? That\u2019s her thing, she has plans.\u201d But he said that he and Simon Johnson, an M.I.T. economist close to Ms. Warren, were not rushed by campaign officials after they began working together at the end of August. Ms. Warren\u2019s own staff had produced the initial outline of her proposal and began circulating it among a small network of economists and academics, both for input and, eventually, public validation. \u201cIt did kick into a higher gear after the last debate,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody\u2019s Analytics, whom the campaign has consulted on this and other policy proposals. The Warren campaign also tipped the progressive group Data for Progress about her proposal; it rushed a poll into the field on Oct. 30 and 31, and released its favorable results on Nov. 1, the same day as Ms. Warren\u2019s plan. The proposal, which would require an estimated $20.5 trillion in new federal spending over 10 years, immediately came under attack from Ms. Warren\u2019s rivals, chiefly Mr. Biden, who said \u201cshe\u2019s making it up.\u201d  His campaign manager recently warned that Medicare for all could cost Democrats the House. Ms. Jayapal, the Seattle congresswoman whom Ms. Warren called before releasing her plan, said it was a milestone to have a front-runner fully embrace government-provided Medicare for all. \u201cIt was tricky political terrain because it was Bernie\u2019s issue,\u201d said Ms. Jayapal, who has not endorsed a Democratic candidate. \u201cShe had to figure out a way to not step on that but also make the issue her own.\u201d At a campaign event in North Carolina recently, Ms. Warren delivered an emphatic rejoinder to those who said it was misguided and impossible to enact. \u201cYou don\u2019t get what you don\u2019t fight for,\u201d she said. Less than 30 minutes earlier, Ms. Warren had been asked to list the first three bills she would want to sign into law. Medicare for all did not make the cut.",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Senator Elizabeth Warren has found a favorite set of adversaries in the 2020 presidential race: America\u2019s billionaires. In a new TV ad, Ms. Warren singles out a series of billionaires who have spoken out against her, showing footage of them and repeating her call for a wealth tax on the fortunes of the richest Americans. The ad, set to air Thursday on CNBC in New York City and Washington, is the latest volley in the back-and-forth between Ms. Warren and the country\u2019s billionaires \u2014 or at least an outspoken handful of them who have criticized her publicly. And it comes as Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire and former New York City mayor, is preparing to enter the presidential race. \u201cIt is time for a wealth tax in America,\u201d Ms. Warren says in the ad, which shows her speaking at a recent town hall event. \u201cI\u2019ve heard that there are some billionaires who don\u2019t support this plan.\u201d Then the ad gets specific, identifying four billionaires and helpfully informing viewers of their estimated net worth. First is the hedge fund manager Leon G. Cooperman, who has publicly sparred with Ms. Warren (his estimated net worth: $3.2 billion). \u201cThe vilification of billionaires makes no sense to me,\u201d he is shown saying in the ad. \u201cIt\u2019s bull.\u201d Then this flashes onscreen: \u201cCharged with insider trading.\u201d (The Securities and Exchange Commission sued Mr. Cooperman and his firm, Omega Advisors, in 2016; he and the firm settled in 2017.) The ad also shows footage of Joe Ricketts, the founder of TD Ameritrade; Lloyd C. Blankfein, the former chief executive of Goldman Sachs; and the venture capitalist Peter Thiel. The ad closes with Ms. Warren asking the richest Americans to \u201cpitch in two cents,\u201d along with a list of social programs that could be funded with the revenue from her proposed wealth tax. Ms. Warren wants to impose an annual tax of 2 percent on net worth above $50 million, and 6 percent above $1 billion. She would use the revenue to fund proposals like universal child care, free public college and student debt cancellation, as well as to help pay for \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d In the primary race, Ms. Warren, of Massachusetts, generally avoids taking shots at her Democratic rivals, but she has embraced the fight with her billionaire critics. Last week, her campaign rolled out an online calculator showing what billionaires would owe under her wealth tax, depending on the size of their fortune. The calculator includes a link to show what Mr. Cooperman, specifically, would owe under the wealth tax. Mr. Cooperman fired back on Wednesday in response to the ad, calling Ms. Warren \u201cdisgraceful\u201d in an interview with CNBC. \u201cIn my opinion, she represents the worst in politicians as she\u2019s trying to demonize wealthy people, because there are more poor people than wealthy people,\u201d Mr. Cooperman said. On Wednesday night, Ms. Warren\u2019s team posted on social media about a new piece of merchandise: Mr. Cooperman had teared up during an interview on CNBC earlier this month, and the Warren campaign is now selling mugs printed with the retort, \u201cBILLIONAIRE TEARS.\u201d",

      "author": "Astead W. Herndon",
      "content": " Representative Ayanna S. Pressley of Massachusetts, the only member of the group of progressive first-term congresswomen nicknamed \u201cthe squad\u201d who had not yet backed a Democratic presidential candidate, has endorsed Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a longtime ally. Ms. Pressley announced her decision in an email to supporters Wednesday afternoon, and released a corresponding video announcement. \u201cElizabeth has made it her life\u2019s work to pursue justice for working families and put economic and political power in the hands of people,\u201d Ms. Pressley said in a statement. \u201cWe find ourselves in a fight for the soul of our nation, and I know Elizabeth can win it.\u201d In choosing Ms. Warren, Ms. Pressley provided her home-state senator with her most high-profile congressional endorsement to this point, and avoided ruffling feathers in the closely-knit Massachusetts Democratic Party. She also split from her congressional cohort, as Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan all endorsed the race\u2019s other ardent progressive, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, last month. Ms. Pressley was elected to Congress last year, after a grass-roots, multiracial coalition lifted her to victory over Representative Michael E. Capuano in Boston\u2019s only majority-minority district. She was the first black woman elected to Congress from Massachusetts, and her endorsement gives Ms. Warren a prominent black surrogate in a campaign that must gain traction with black voters in order to overtake former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. in the race for the Democratic nomination. Ms. Warren has done significant outreach to black progressive groups and Democratic leaders over the past year \u2014 more than any other white candidate in the race. However, recent polls still show her trailing Mr. Biden among black voters by almost 30 points and she lags in South Carolina, the early primary state where black voters make up more than 60 percent of the electorate. \u201cI have seen Ms. Warren in small church basements and in packed gymnasiums,\u201d Ms. Pressley said in the video. \u201cAnd she is consistent. She never loses sight of the people.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve all heard about the senator\u2019s plans \u2014 but here\u2019s the thing,\u201d she added. \u201cHer plans are about power: who has it, who refuses to let it go, and who deserves more of it.\u201d The endorsement was a must-have for Ms. Warren, who has risen sharply in polls and fund-raising over the last six months but has lagged in some traditional measures of party support, including endorsements from governors, big-city mayors, or fellow senators outside Massachusetts. In recent weeks her campaign has sought to reverse that trend by lining up endorsements from anti-establishment progressive champions popular among the party\u2019s left wing. Representative Katie Porter of California endorsed Ms. Warren over her home-state legislator, Senator Kamala Harris of California. Mayor Jim Kenney of Philadelphia announced his support for Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign last month, her first endorsement from a big-city mayor. Ms. Warren also recently rolled out endorsements from two of the country\u2019s most progressive district attorneys: Larry Krasner of Philadelphia and Rachael Rollins of Suffolk County in Massachusetts. Mr. Krasner, who supported Mr. Sanders in 2016, received some blowback for endorsing Ms. Warren over Mr. Sanders, who remains in striking distance in most polls. \u201cI have not forgotten and no one should forget that Bernie Sanders, early in his prior campaign for president, said the only reason he ran was that he couldn\u2019t persuade his friend Elizabeth Warren to run for president,\u201d Mr. Krasner said in response. \u201cI heard what he said, and I remembered what he said.\u201d While Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, Ms. Omar, and Ms. Tlaib have become household names partly out of their willingness to upset the Democratic establishment, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Ms. Pressley has gained a reputation as a cautious Capitol Hill operator. Ms. Pressley, 45, was the first nonwhite woman elected to the Boston City Council in 2009 and had a robust local constituency before being elected to Congress. Unlike newcomers like Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, who speaks about how Mr. Sanders\u2019s presidential run in 2016 helped motivate her to seek elected office, Ms. Pressley was a delegate for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election and has close relationships with the party\u2019s traditional power brokers. She is also considered a prospective candidate for Ms. Warren\u2019s Senate seat should Ms. Warren win the White House. Some in Massachusetts have speculated that Ms. Pressley could play the role of television surrogate for Ms. Warren, serving as a progressive ally who would implicitly counteract perceptions of her campaign as geared toward white elites. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, Ms. Omar, and Ms. Tlaib are helping play a similar role for Mr. Sanders, and have held rallies with him in their respective home districts of New York City, Minneapolis, and Detroit. In Massachusetts, where the congressional delegation only comprises Democrats and where a contentious Senate primary is currently underway, Ms. Pressley\u2019s endorsement speaks to the high-stakes political game of who to back \u2014 and when. Ms. Pressley was not a part of the initial round of home-state endorsements during Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign launch earlier this year, leading to speculation that she would sit out the presidential primary or back Ms. Harris, the 2020 race\u2019s only black woman. Instead, Ms. Pressley joined Ms. Warren\u2019s cause, politically cementing the informal friendship that has existed among them for years. In 2018, when Ms. Pressley announced plans to run against Mr. Capuano, Ms. Warren stayed out of the race \u2014 a sign the grass-roots campaign Ms. Pressley had built was exceeding expectations. Now, it\u2019s Ms. Pressley playing power broker, as Ms. Warren seeks to usurp the establishment herself.",

      "author": "Neil Vigdor",
      "content": "  It was a moment Senator Elizabeth Warren was prepared for on the debate stage, capitalizing on a day of bombshell testimony by the United States ambassador to the European Union in the impeachment inquiry to highlight the fact that her anti-corruption platform included a pledge to not give ambassador posts to big donors. On Thursday, it was clear that the campaign thought this message was resonating with voters, as it turning around a quick digital ad that mimicked Ms. Warren\u2019s answer about the ambassador, Gordon D. Sondland. It noted that none of her Democratic rivals had joined her in her pledge. \u201cAt the center of Donald Trump\u2019s crimes and chaos is the millionaire donor he made an ambassador,\u201d Ms. Warren says, narrating the ad. \u201cI\u2019ll never give ambassadorships to unqualified donors just because they wrote me fat checks.\u201d  The ad provides a key moment of synergy for Ms. Warren as the Democratic primary has often been overshadowed by the impeachment inquiry in Washington, tying her platform to the day-to-day news and quickly putting it online. And it gives her an additional contrast to draw with another top-tier candidate, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who has been among the top recipients of big donors and declined on Thursday to commit to Ms. Warren\u2019s pledge, according to a Wall Street Journal reporter. Ms. Warren was not alone in addressing impeachment on the debate stage Wednesday night. Several other senators contending for the Democratic nomination said that they believed there was enough evidence to convince their Republican colleagues to convict President Trump. The subject of impeachment proceedings against Mr. Trump came up right at the outset of the debate, which was hosted by MSNBC and The Washington Post and held in Atlanta. \u201cSadly we have a president who is not only a pathological liar, he is likely the most corrupt president in modern history,\u201d Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont said during the debate\u2019s opening segment. Ms. Warren, of Massachusetts, said Mr. Sondland, who gave $1 million to Mr. Trump\u2019s inaugural committee, had bought his diplomatic post. \u201cYou know, this is not a man who had any qualifications except one: he wrote a check for a million dollars,\u201d Ms. Warren said. \u201cAnd that tells us about what\u2019s happening in Washington \u2014 the corruption \u2014 how money buys its way into Washington. You know, I raised this months ago about the whole notion that donors think they\u2019re going to get ambassadorships on the other side.\u201d Senator Kamala Harris of California said \u201cjustice is on the ballot.\u201d \u201cFirst of all, we have a criminal living in the White House,\u201d Ms. Harris said. The senators\u2019 comments followed riveting testimony by Mr. Sondland on Wednesday in front of the House Intelligence Committee, during which he said top members of the Trump administration had been \u201cin the loop\u201d about a quid pro quo effort by the president to get Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate the son of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. Below is a transcript of part of Ms. Warren\u2019s response: WARREN: But I want to add one more part based on today\u2019s testimony and that is how did ambassador Sondland get there? You know, this is not a man who had any qualifications except one: He wrote a check for a million dollars. And that tells us about what\u2019s happening in Washington \u2014 the corruption \u2014 how money buys its way into Washington. You know, I raised this months ago about the whole notion that donors think they\u2019re going to get ambassadorships on the other side. And I\u2019ve taken a pledge. Anyone who wants to give me a big donation, don\u2019t ask to be an ambassador because I\u2019m not going to have that happen. I asked everyone who\u2019s running for president to join me in that. And not a single person has so far. I hope what we saw today during the testimony means lots of people will sign on and say we are not going to give away the ambassador posts to the highest bidder.",
