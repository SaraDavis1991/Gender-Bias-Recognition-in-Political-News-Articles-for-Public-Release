      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Senator Mitch McConnell, the taciturn Republican leader, watched stoically from across the Capitol two years ago as Speaker John A. Boehner resigned rather than contend with mounting troubles, restive conservatives and a band of renegade Republicans looking to oust him. Now it is Mr. McConnell who has a target on his back. His party is smarting from losses at the ballot box last week in Virginia, New Jersey and off-year races across the country. A trio of Senate Republicans who are not running for re-election have gone rogue and feel no compunction to fall in line behind him. The Republican nominee for Senate, Roy S. Moore, has just been accused of improper sexual and romantic conduct with teenagers. And Stephen K. Bannon, President Trump\u2019s former chief strategist, is vowing to depose him, telling The New York Times that \u201cI have an objective that Mitch McConnell will not be majority leader, and I believe will be done before this time next year.\u201d Mr. McConnell, he added, \u201chas to go.\u201d [How to listen: If you don\u2019t see an audio player on this page, or if you would like to subscribe to \u201cThe New Washington\u201d at no charge, follow the instructions at the end of this article.] To that, Mr. McConnell laughed. \u201cYou can write that down,\u201d he said in an interview on Friday. \u201cI laughed. Ha-ha. That\u2019s a perfect response.\u201d Villainized by the president\u2019s populist wing, Mr. McConnell nonetheless is pressing forward with a conservative agenda that he hopes will give Mr. Trump some big wins \u2014 and perhaps a legacy. He knows he must pass a tax overhaul in the coming weeks if his party is to have any hope of holding on to a united Congress next year \u2014 and if he is to remain majority leader. Meantime, he is trying to remake the nation\u2019s judiciary, stocking the bench with Mr. Trump\u2019s judicial nominees. At 75, Mr. McConnell is a man of few words but many sayings. Among his favorites: \u201cLosers go into another line of work and winners come to Washington to make policy.\u201d And: \u201cWhen you\u2019re hit with a pebble, respond with a boulder.\u201d The target of that boulder would appear to be Mr. Bannon, a man whose name he refuses to utter, favoring \u201cthis particular individual\u201d or \u201cthat particular element of our party,\u201d or simply \u201cthey.\u201d \u201cTheir specialty is nominating people who lose in November,\u201d Mr. McConnell said acidly, adding, \u201cWhen they prevail, and they haven\u2019t done that in recent years, we lose, and our intention in 2018 is they will not prevail anywhere.\u201d Mr. Bannon has been urging Senate candidates to pledge to vote against Mr. McConnell for majority leader, and he is making his campaign strikingly personal, \u201cbecause the Senate and Mitch McConnell have been the most outrageous in their lack of support of President Trump\u2019s agenda,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy Mitch McConnell?\u201d Mr. Bannon asked. \u201cBecause the institution of the majority leader has so much power, and he has used that power to, quite frankly, thwart President Trump\u2019s agenda.\u201d Mr. McConnell shot back: \u201cVirtually everyone he has criticized, including myself, supports the president over 90 percent of the time.\u201d He added: \u201cThe only way the president\u2019s agenda doesn\u2019t get enacted is if this particular element were to defeat enough senators in the general election to hand the Senate over to Democrats. That\u2019s the only possible outcome if this kind of mentality were allowed to prevail. But I assure you it will not. It will not.\u201d The battle with Mr. Bannon puts the leader in a precarious position. On the one hand, he is trying to improve his tenuous relationship with Mr. Trump. On the other, he finds himself fending off attacks from one of the president\u2019s closest allies. \u201cMitch will be very calm, he\u2019ll be very strategic, he\u2019ll be very surgical and he will eventually eviscerate Mr. Bannon, and Bannon won\u2019t even know what happened to him,\u201d said Bill Stone, a former chairman of the Republican Party in Louisville who is close to Mr. McConnell. \u201cBannon is dealing with a man of intellect and a man of experience and a man of patience and resolve like he\u2019s never met in his life.\u201d Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee and one of Mr. McConnell\u2019s closest friends in the Senate, said the leader is paying scant attention. \u201cMitch is experienced, he\u2019s tough, he\u2019s purposeful,\u201d Mr. Alexander said. \u201cHe\u2019s not deflected by irrelevant attacks.\u201d But the denizens of \u201cMcConnell World,\u201d as the leader\u2019s allies like to call themselves, are not so indifferent. They plan a campaign that will attack Mr. Bannon personally and seek to undermine his credibility by spotlighting his controversial comments and linking him with white nationalist groups. The first hints of that strategy have surfaced in the press and on social media. Mr. McConnell\u2019s former chief of staff, Josh Holmes, referred to Mr. Bannon as a \u201cwhite supremacist\u201d in a recent interview with The Hill newspaper. And the Senate Leadership Fund, a political action committee closely aligned with Mr. McConnell, recently took to Twitter to circulate a newspaper headline that called Mr. Bannon an anti-Semite. For his part, Mr. Bannon called the charges \u201ca hundred percent media fabrication\u201d and the refuge of opponents that have nothing else. \u201cThey think the only way they can run is by smearing you to be a nativist, a misogynist, a racist, a homophobe,\u201d he said. \u201cJust go down the line.\u201d (A recent article in BuzzFeed News used leaked documents and emails to directly link Mr. Bannon and his publication, Breitbart News, to the right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos and some of the most extreme elements of the rising white supremacist movement.) Billy Piper, a lobbyist and former chief of staff to Mr. McConnell, sees trouble in the brewing fight. \u201cThe worst fights are often the inside-the-family fights,\u201d Mr. Piper said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t navigate these waters the right way, I think the inevitable result is losing seats, and that\u2019s not in any Republicans\u2019 interest and certainly not in the president\u2019s interest. It\u2019s challenging, and McConnell is at the center of that.\u201d Mr. McConnell has long been celebrated as a brilliant tactician, but he is struggling to govern with just a two-vote majority, and his record of legislative accomplishments this year is thin. He is still grappling with the fallout from the Senate\u2019s failure to repeal the Affordable Care Act. \u201cThere\u2019s no way you can put lipstick on that pig and make it look good,\u201d said Trent Lott, a former Senate Republican leader. Mr. McConnell has also had a difficult relationship with Mr. Trump. They spent months feuding with one another, a conflict that reached a nadir in August, when Mr. McConnell privately told allies he feared Mr. Trump could not salvage his presidency. \u201cHe has to use considerable diplomacy working with the White House and elements of the administration,\u201d said Richard G. Lugar, a former Republican senator who lost a re-election primary  to a Tea Party challenger in 2012, who then lost the Indiana seat to a Democrat. \u201cHe understands human nature and the differing ambitions of people. But also he understands his responsibility. He\u2019s the leader. He has to produce.\u201d The two worked to patch things up during a White House lunch last month, followed by a 45-minute impromptu news conference in the Rose Garden that left the leader feeling buoyed \u2014 and fellow Republicans feeling relieved. \u201cThey are both focused on the tax agenda, and I think the president realizes that he needs Mitch in order to accomplish his agenda,\u201d said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine. And after a string of legislative losses, Mr. McConnell can at least point to one win: The Senate recently confirmed four circuit court judges, bringing to eight the number of federal appeals court judges the chamber has confirmed during Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency. Afterward, Mr. Trump rewarded him with enthusiastic Twitter praise: \u201cOur courts are rapidly changing for the better!\u201d Mr. McConnell makes the case that Mr. Trump\u2019s most lasting legacy will come from remaking the federal judiciary by putting conservative jurists on the bench \u2014 including Justice Neil M. Gorsuch of the Supreme Court, who was seated after Mr. McConnell refused to allow hearings on Merrick Garland, former President Barack Obama\u2019s nominee. Mr. McConnell said that \u201ctransforming the judiciary\u201d is his No. 1 priority, even higher than the tax overhaul. \u201cThe most important decision I\u2019ve made in my political career,\u201d he said, \u201cwas the decision not to do something; it was the decision not to fill the Supreme Court vacancy created by the death of Justice Scalia.\u201d ____________ On your iPhone or iPad: Open the preloaded app called Podcasts; it has a purple icon.

      "content": " Even before Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican leader, knew the source of an embarrassing leaked recording, he attacked \u201cthe political left\u201d for \u201cwiretapping\u201d him and invoked Watergate. Opponents accused him of trying to divert attention from the substance of the recording \u2014 in which he and his staff discussed attacking the actress Ashley Judd, who was considering running against him. But on Thursday, Mr. McConnell\u2019s suspicion seemed to be confirmed. A Democratic official in Kentucky said two activists had told him of secretly recording the meeting while in a hallway of Mr. McConnell\u2019s re-election headquarters in Louisville. \u201cApparently the gentlemen overheard the conversation and decided to record it with a phone or recording device they had in their pocket,\u201d Jacob Conway, a Democratic Party county executive, told the NPR News station in Louisville. Mr. Conway identified the activists as members of Progress Kentucky, a political action committee unaffiliated with a candidate. He told Fox News he was coming forward to protect the Democratic Party, after the Federal Bureau of Investigation began looking into the recording. Jesse Benton, Mr. McConnell\u2019s campaign manager, said F.B.I. agents revisited the offices on Thursday and apparently collected surveillance video from the lobby. \u201cThey believe a prosecution is going to happen in the not too distant future,\u201d he said. On the tape, first posted online by Mother Jones magazine on Tuesday, Mr. McConnell, who is up for re-election in 2014, tells aides that \u201cthis is the Whac-a-Mole period of the campaign,\u201d adding, \u201cwhen anybody sticks their head up, do them out.\u201d Most of the tape includes staff members discussing negative research dug up on Ms. Judd, including a history of depression and her religious views. A recording is played of her explaining, \u201cI enjoy native faith practices and have a very nature-based God concept.\u201d Last month, Ms. Judd, after flirting with a Senate bid, announced she would not run. Legal experts said that if a recording was made without the permission of Mr. McConnell\u2019s staff, it could qualify as a felony under Kentucky\u2019s eavesdropping law. \u201cSimply \u2018overhearing\u2019 the conversation in the hallway is not likely a crime,\u201d said Joshua A. Douglas, a law professor at the University of Kentucky, but recording it \u201ccould violate the statute.\u201d Although candidates routinely gather \u201copposition research\u201d about rivals, a left-leaning watchdog group, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, asked the F.B.I. and the Senate Ethics Committee on Thursday to investigate if laws were violated by McConnell staff members who did the research on Senate time or using Senate resources. McConnell officials said all the research was done on weekends and out of the office. The meeting in Louisville took place on a Saturday, Feb. 2. According to Mr. Conway, the Progress Kentucky activists showed up outside a meeting room as an open house for McConnell supporters was winding down. \u201cOne of them held the elevator, the other one did the recording and they left,\u201d he told the radio station, WFPL. He identified them as the group\u2019s founder, Shawn Reilly, and a volunteer, Curtis Morrison. Neither responded to messages on Thursday. Democrats still do not have a candidate willing to challenge the formidable war chest and aggressive campaign style of Mr. McConnell, though polls show only a minority of Kentuckians are committed to vote for him again. \u201cI think he\u2019s clearly vulnerable; his irritation over the last week underscores that he knows that, too,\u201d said J. B. Poersch, who formerly led the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. As major issues stirred to life in Congress \u2014 gun control, immigration and the budget \u2014 the circuslike diversion at home presented a further distraction for Mr. McConnell, who Democrats say is more focused on defending his seat, especially from the right, than leading his party. They noted that Mr. McConnell has sided with conservative senators in several losing battles, including proposed filibusters, in which some Republicans joined Democrats to outmaneuver him. Mr. Benton scoffed at that notion. \u201cI feel very confident we\u2019ve consolidated support of Republicans,\u201d he said. \u201cThe national Democrats have made it very clear that they want nothing better than to give Senator McConnell a tough race.\u201d",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Senator Mitch McConnell took a sarcastic shot on Friday at Stephen K. Bannon, telling reporters at an end-of-the-year news conference that Mr. Bannon\u2019s \u201cpolitical genius\u201d had cost the party a Senate seat in Alabama. As he looked to the new year, on the heels of this week\u2019s passage of a landmark tax overhaul that Mr. Trump signed into law on Friday, Mr. McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, used most of the news conference to revisit what he called the \u201cextraordinary\u201d accomplishments of this year, and to sketch the broad outlines of his legislative agenda for early 2018. He said he hoped that Democrats and Republicans would unite around an immigration bill that would protect young undocumented immigrants from deportation. But Mr. McConnell also turned to politics. He will have to contend next year with midterm elections \u2014 and that means contending with Mr. Bannon, President Trump\u2019s former chief strategist and a fiery populist who is working to elect Republicans in the mold of Mr. Trump by waging primary election challenges against some incumbent Republican senators or candidates backed by Mr. McConnell. Complicating their charged relationship is the question of whose side Mr. Trump will take. Mr. McConnell expressed confidence that the president would back the candidates he picks, saying, \u201cI believe the White House will be in the same place I am.\u201d In Arizona, for instance, Mr. Bannon is behind the candidacy of Kelli Ward, a doctor who lost a hard-fought primary race last year to Senator John McCain. Mr. McConnell said Friday that he backs Representative Martha McSally, though she has not yet formally announced her candidacy for the seat being vacated by Senator Jeff Flake. And in Nevada, Mr. McConnell is supporting the incumbent Republican, Senator Dean Heller, while Mr. Bannon is behind Danny Tarkanian, a businessman and serial candidate for public office. Analysts say Democrats have a shot of winning in both Arizona and Nevada. If they do, Republicans would lose their majority. \u201cThose two races are on a knife\u2019s edge, and the wrong nominee takes you out of the game,\u201d said Scott Jennings, a Republican strategist who is close to Mr. McConnell. In Alabama, Mr. McConnell had backed Senator Luther Strange, the Republican incumbent who filled the seat after its previous occupant, Jeff Sessions, became attorney general. Mr. Bannon supported Roy S. Moore, the controversial former judge who ultimately won the Republican primary \u2014 and was later accused of making inappropriate sexual advances toward teenagers. Mr. Moore lost  this month to Doug Jones, a Democrat. For Mr. McConnell, the result is that an already slim 52-48 majority became even slimmer; Republicans will have just 51 seats in the Senate, while Democrats and the two independents who caucus with them will have 49. Mr. McConnell was asked Friday whether he blamed Mr. Bannon for the loss. \u201cWell, let me just say this,\u201d Mr. McConnell replied, suppressing a sly smile. \u201cThe political genius on display of throwing away a seat in the reddest state in America is hard to ignore.\u201d Mr. McConnell still has painful memories of the 2010 and 2012 election cycles, in which Republicans nominated Tea Party candidates who could not appeal to a general election audience. So in 2015, Mr. McConnell helped create the Senate Leadership Fund, a political action committee aimed at protecting and expanding the Republican majority. He alluded to the fund in his remarks on Friday. \u201cWe continued with a different approach in 2016,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat was the difference? We didn\u2019t nominate people who couldn\u2019t win in November.\u201d The bad blood between Mr. McConnell and Mr. Bannon is no secret \u2014 they have been publicly feuding for months. In November, Mr. Bannon vowed to oust Mr. McConnell as majority leader,  saying in an interview, \u201cI have an objective that Mitch McConnell will not be majority leader,\u201d adding that Mr. McConnell \u201chas got to go.\u201d To that, Mr. McConnell replied, \u201cHa ha.\u201d",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 As Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, a 71-year-old Republican fixture in Washington, prepares to try to fend off a challenge by Alison Lundergan Grimes, a 34-year-old Democratic political newcomer, his team says he will address and even embrace the gender and generational differences between them. Given recent struggles that Republican Senate contenders have had with women\u2019s issues, Mr. McConnell\u2019s advisers say they intend to confront head-on the criticism Democrats have already begun leveling against him on issues they view as particularly important to female voters. \u201cThe long and short of it is, we\u2019re going to be very aggressive in making sure people don\u2019t mischaracterize what his record is, especially when it comes to women and women\u2019s issues,\u201d said Josh Holmes, Mr. McConnell\u2019s chief of staff for Kentucky operations. \u201cNot only are we not afraid of it, we\u2019re very proud of it.\u201d Mr. McConnell, the Senate Republican leader, has faced a female opponent only once during his nearly 30 years in the Senate. He and his team seem eager to try to head off a campaign in 2014 that could become a referendum on how female voters feel about the Republican Party\u2019s recent record. Several times he has explained his vote this year against the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, and his office \u2014 normally averse to stories about staff members \u2014 has willingly offered up for interviews the \u201cstrong women\u201d with whom they say Mr. McConnell has always surrounded himself. His wife, Elaine Chao, served as labor secretary during President George W. Bush\u2019s entire time in office. He is also strengthening his campaign staff. According to recent financial reports, his re-election campaign has paid more than a dozen consultants and consulting firms, including Crowdverb, a Seattle start-up specializing in \u201cbehavioral science.\u201d And he has been aggressively raising money, traveling from Florida to New York to Texas to raise roughly $1.7 million in the second quarter, giving him nearly $9.6 million at the end of June. Mr. McConnell now also faces a Tea Party primary challenge from the right, which could further complicate his efforts as he tries to simultaneously appeal to his party\u2019s more conservative base and peel off the female voters Ms. Grimes is targeting. Matthew Bevin, a Louisville businessman, announced on Wednesday that he planned to challenge Mr. McConnell in the Republican primary. Democrats say Mr. McConnell has reason to be nervous, particularly after politically charged comments on gender issues hurt Republicans in the 2012 elections, costing them Senate seats in Indiana and Missouri. \u201cI think everything Mitch McConnell does right now is just another example of how worried he is and how vulnerable he feels,\u201d said Representative John Yarmuth, a Kentucky Democrat and longtime opponent. \u201cObviously, just the fact that there\u2019s a gender difference makes Alison much more credible with women voters, and she\u2019s going to have a much more receptive audience for discussions of things like how Mitch\u2019s attempts to destroy the Affordable Care Act will hurt women.\u201d The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee is already attacking Mr. McConnell on his opposition to the Paycheck Fairness Act, which would help women fight pay discrimination in the workplace, and his recent vote on the Violence Against Women Act. It is also trying to portray him as an embodiment of entrenched Washington. \u201cHe\u2019s a symbol. He\u2019s a caricature,\u201d said Matt Canter, a spokesman for the committee. \u201cIf Walt Disney were making a villain of Washington, he\u2019d probably look a lot like Mitch McConnell.\u201d Mr. McConnell\u2019s aides see the situation differently. They not only say they are eager to defend his record on votes like the one against the Violence Against Women Act \u2014 asserting that he supported an even stronger alternative \u2014 but also say a full accounting of his time in Washington will show that he is the candidate who best represents both the men and women of Kentucky. They say it is impossible to tell the story of Mr. McConnell without talking about the accomplished, powerful women who have always been integral to his life, including his mother, who devoted herself to helping a young Mitch overcome polio; Ms. Chao; and many of his top staff members. \u201cSenator McConnell is married to an extremely distinguished, well-educated, powerful woman,\u201d Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said when asked if she thought Mr. McConnell\u2019s 2014 race could become about women\u2019s issues. \u201cThat\u2019s not the sign of a man who feels threatened by powerful women.\u201d An analysis by LegiStorm, an online database that tracks Congressional staff members, supports the assertions of Mr. McConnell\u2019s office: the staff in his Washington office is 54 percent female, putting him in the top third of senators in terms of hiring and employing women. In three recent meetings at the White House, Mr. McConnell\u2019s staff pointed out, the chief of staff in his leadership office, Sharon Soderstrom, was the only woman in the room besides Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader. And previous female staff members talked about how Mr. McConnell\u2019s office was a meritocracy. Janet Mullins Grissom, who ran his first Senate campaign in 1984 and then came to Washington with him as his first chief of staff, recalled, \u201cThere were very few female chiefs in 1985, and very few female campaign managers.\u201d \u201cIn the course of my career, I\u2019ve had two bosses who were gender blind when it came to the work force \u2014 one was Secretary Baker in the Bush administration, and one was Senator McConnell,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was solely based on merit.\u201d However, Ms. Grimes\u2019s campaign sees an opening with female voters and plans to cast her as an advocate of their concerns. \u201cThere\u2019s a strong contrast between the two on issues that are important to women,\u201d said Jonathan Hurst, a senior adviser to Ms. Grimes\u2019s campaign. \u201cI think Kentuckians, especially women, will vote for Alison Lundergan Grimes because she\u2019s been a champion of issues that are important to women, and I think it will be tough for Senator McConnell because he\u2019s obstructed real meaningful solutions.\u201d As Democratic e-mails continue to paint Mr. McConnell as a \u201cself-proclaimed \u2018proud guardian of gridlock\u2019\u00a0\u201d who is \u201churting Kentucky women with unprecedented levels of obstruction,\u201d his team is ready with its own long list of examples that counter the Democratic portrayal. His aides point to, among other things, his decision in 1995, as chairman of the ethics committee, to recommend that Bob Packwood, at the time a Republican senator from Oregon, be expelled for sexual misconduct charges; the fact that he was a co-sponsor of an early version of the Violence Against Women Act (though he voted against the original law in 1994); and his early support and cosponsorship of legislation allowing female Air Force pilots to fly combat missions. The first time Mr. McConnell and Ms. Grimes are likely to face each other is early next month at a political picnic in Graves County, Ky., and the race is still taking shape. But Trey Grayson, the director of the Institute of Politics at Harvard and a former Kentucky secretary of state, explained, \u201cWhen men are running against women, it\u2019s a different dynamic than when two guys are running against each other.\u201d Mr. McConnell\u2019s team also expects his wife, Ms. Chao, to defend her husband on the campaign trail. \u201cBelieve me,\u201d said Mr. Holmes, the McConnell aide, \u201cElaine Chao is happy to talk about how the senator views women.\u201d",

The defeat of Senator Luther Strange, the Alabama Republican who was defending the Senate seat he was appointed to, coupled with the implosion of the party\u2019s last-ditch attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act, marked twin setbacks for Mr. McConnell, who is struggling to govern with an already slim majority. Now, a majority leader celebrated for years as a brilliant tactician looks vulnerable \u2014 to dissent within his Senate conference and to insurgents from President Trump\u2019s populist wing of the party, who are looking to storm the Senate in 2018. And if Republicans fail to fulfill their next promise \u2014 overhauling the tax code \u2014 the consequences will be dire. \u201cWe have to deliver on tax reform,\u201d said Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, who is a member of the party\u2019s leadership. \u201cI don\u2019t think failure is an option.\u201d The Alabama race, and the unsuccessful repeal effort, have exposed how deeply dissatisfied conservatives are with Mr. McConnell, a taciturn Kentuckian who has been in the Senate since 1985 and has led his conference for the past decade. Even Mr. McConnell\u2019s allies concede that the failure to dismantle former President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law helped fuel the outcome in Alabama. \u201cThere is this acute, continued frustration amongst the Republican base at the sluggishness of the Trump agenda in Washington,\u201d said Josh Holmes, a former chief of staff to Mr. McConnell. \u201cThat\u2019s not imagined; that\u2019s real.\u201d Mr. Strange lost his primary runoff to Roy Moore, a provocative former chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, who made attacking Mr. McConnell a central feature of his campaign. \u201cMcConnell has become synonymous with gridlock,\u201d said Richard C. Fording, a political scientist at the University of Alabama who followed the race closely. \u201cI think people here are frustrated, and they have bought into this narrative that Mitch McConnell is to blame, that he\u2019s incompetent, that he\u2019s part of the establishment, that he\u2019s controlled by special interests and synonymous with the status quo.\u201d Allies of Mr. McConnell poured millions into the runoff contest, painting Mr. Strange as a reliable Trump loyalist and Mr. Moore as a lifelong, untrustworthy politician. But that story line never broke through. In fact, the race spotlighted growing divisions between establishment Republicans personified by Mr. McConnell and his allies and Trump Republicans, even though it was Mr. Strange who had the president\u2019s endorsement. The gap was so wide that when Mr. Trump campaigned for Mr. Strange, he tried to distance the senator from the Republican leader. \u201cThey say he\u2019s friendly with Mitch \u2014 he doesn\u2019t even know Mitch McConnell,\u201d Mr. Trump told a raucous crowd of several thousand people. That was not quite true. The Senate Leadership Fund, a \u201csuper PAC\u201d that Mr. McConnell helped found, spent nearly $9 million trying to elect Mr. Strange, said Steven Law, its president and chief executive. Mr. Law, like Mr. Holmes, attributed the outcome of the campaign to \u201cdissatisfaction with the sluggish pace of change in Washington,\u201d adding that \u201cRepublican primary voters are just as angry in 2017 as they were in 2016.\u201d With Democrats across the country energized by the election of Mr. Trump, some analysts say Democrats now have an outside chance to pick up the seat \u2014 even in a deeply conservative state like Alabama. But if Mr. Moore wins, he will almost certainly be a wild card in the Senate, where Mr. McConnell is already struggling to keep the 52 Republicans in line. \u201cThe stakes here are high,\u201d said Scott Jennings, a Republican strategist who is close to Mr. McConnell. \u201cHis majority of 52 is slim, and it\u2019s even slimmer when you consider at any given time there are four to six of them who are contrarians. So if you take out a Luther, who is not a contrarian, and you throw in a Roy Moore, who\u2019s going to be a contrarian, that makes the majority even less effective and productive.\u201d And it could get worse \u2014 much worse. Buoyed by Mr. Moore\u2019s victory, conservatives like the former Trump strategist Stephen K. Bannon and Sarah Palin, the former governor of Alaska, now speak of separating \u201cTrumpism\u201d from Mr. Trump, and they are throwing themselves behind insurgent populists around the country. Already, Trumpist candidates have emerged to challenge Senators Dean Heller of Nevada and Jeff Flake of Arizona in Republican primary races next year. In Mississippi, Mr. Bannon is courting another firebrand, State Senator Chris McDaniel, to challenge Senator Roger Wicker, who embodies low-key country-club Republicanism. And Mr. Bannon and allies are looking for a populist candidate to run for Tennessee\u2019s Senate seat, which opened up Tuesday when Senator Bob Corker, a Republican, announced that he would not run for re-election. Victories by such candidates would drastically remake the Senate, and could threaten Mr. McConnell\u2019s leadership. Already, conservatives are smelling blood. \u201cIf this was a football team and you lost this many times, you\u2019d start firing the coaches,\u201d said David Bozell, the president of For America, a conservative advocacy group. Richard A. Viguerie, the conservative direct-mail guru, called Mr. Moore\u2019s victory \u201ca stunning rejection of Mitch McConnell\u2019s corrupt and incompetent leadership.\u201d But in the Senate, Mr. McConnell has a deep well of support within his conference, in part because he is so effective a raising money to re-elect his fellow Republicans. He also has a thick skin. \u201cSenator McConnell is not a hot personality,\u201d said Ralph Reed, the chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, an organization of social conservatives. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have real high highs, and he doesn\u2019t have real low lows, and he\u2019s been at this a long time, and he\u2019s smart enough and wise enough to know that there are good days and not so good days in this business.\u201d Senate Republicans are clearly frustrated by the legislative gridlock that has gripped the chamber, especially the on-again, off-again effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act. The latest attempt ended Tuesday when Mr. McConnell concluded that he did not have the votes to pass the so-called Graham-Cassidy bill, which would have taken money spent under the law and given it to the states in the form of block grants. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sent up here to sit around and talk,\u201d complained Senator John Kennedy, a freshman Republican from Louisiana. \u201cI was sent up here to make ordinary Americans\u2019 lives better.\u201d But Mr. Kennedy said he did not blame Mr. McConnell. \u201cThis is not a Mitch McConnell problem,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s got a lot more patience than I would have had.\u201d",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Bureau of Investigation said it was looking into allegations by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky that political opponents bugged his campaign headquarters. Mr. McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate, blamed the \u201cpolitical left\u201d for an anonymous recording of a meeting at his campaign headquarters that appeared on the Web site of Mother Jones, a liberal magazine, on Tuesday morning. The recording captures Mr. McConnell and his aides outlining possible attacks on potential opponents, especially the actress Ashley Judd. \u201cThey were bugging our headquarters, quite a Nixonian move,\u201d Mr. McConnell said Tuesday at a news conference. \u201cThis is what you get from the political left in America these days.\u201d As yet, Mr. McConnell faces no serious challenge to his seat, but the 12-minute tape of a Feb. 2 meeting in Louisville suggests his team was ready with opposition research gathered by aides. \u201cThis is the Whac-A-Mole period of the campaign,\u201d Mr. McConnell said on the tape. \u201cWhen anybody sticks their head up, do them out.\u201d Ms. Judd\u2019s head was up, so to speak, amid speculation that she would run against him in 2014. Along with comments that could mark her as a \u201ccarpetbagger\u201d and an \u201cout-of-touch, Hollywood liberal,\u201d aides found fodder for more personal attacks. \u201cThis sounds extreme, but she is emotionally unbalanced,\u201d one man said. He cited her confessions of suicidal tendencies in an autobiography. The group laughed at an interview in which Ms. Judd, in an apparent critique of American consumerism, said, \u201cI absolutely flipped out when I saw pink fuzzy socks on a rack.\u201d In March, Ms. Judd announced that she would not run for the seat. \u00a0Her spokeswoman said: \u201cThis is yet another example of the politics of personal destruction that embody Mitch McConnell and are pervasive in Washington, D.C. We expected nothing less from Mitch McConnell and his camp than to take a personal struggle such as depression, which many Americans cope with on a daily basis, and turn it into a laughing matter.\u201d A spokeswoman for the F.B.I.\u2019s Louisville division said it was \u201clooking into\u201d the complaints from Mr. McConnell\u2019s office. Senator Jerry Moran of Kansas, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said, \u201cThis \u2018anything to win, laws and rules be damned\u2019 mentality has to stop.\u201d Guy Cecil, executive director of the Senate Democrats\u2019 campaign arm, shot back that the organization \u201cdoesn\u2019t know if this tape came from a disgruntled Senate staffer who was forced to dig up dirt on their boss\u2019s potential opponents or another source.\u201d Mother Jones stood by the report by David Corn, who also published the tape of Mitt Romney\u2019s \u201c47 percent\u201d comments last year. Without revealing the source, the magazine said, \u201cIt is our understanding that the tape was not the product of a Watergate-style bugging operation.\u201d In the tape, McConnell aides acknowledged that they had less material against another potential Democratic challenger, Alison Lundergan Grimes, Kentucky\u2019s secretary of state. David Adams, a Tea Party activist in Kentucky, said Mr. McConnell\u2019s concern about threats from the left was misplaced. \u201cIt\u2019s going to come from the right,\u201d said Mr. Adams, who is seeking a conservative opponent to Mr. McConnell. \u201cThe fact that he\u2019s coming unglued about this thing should make clear to observers that he may not be ready for the challenge that lies ahead.\u201d On Tuesday, the campaign solicited cash and volunteers to \u201cstand with Senator McConnell against illegal wiretapping.\u201d",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, called on Congress on Tuesday to move on from the Mueller report and issued his own verdict from the Senate floor: \u201cCase closed.\u201d \u201cWith an exhaustive investigation complete, would the country finally unify to confront the real challenges before us?\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201cOr would we remain consumed by unhinged partisanship, and keep dividing ourselves to the point that Putin and his agents need only stand on the sidelines and watch as their job is done for them?\u201d \u201cRegrettably,\u201d he continued, \u201cthe answer is obvious.\u201d Mr. McConnell\u2019s speech pointed up the profound gap between the Republican-controlled Senate and the Democrat-controlled House. House Democrats are locked in an escalating fight with President Trump, who is trying to slam shut House investigations of all sorts. The House Judiciary Committee is preparing to hold Attorney General William P. Barr in contempt of Congress on Wednesday for ignoring a subpoena for the full report of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, and his underlying evidence. The Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, told the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Richard E. Neal of Massachusetts, that he would not turn over six years of Mr. Trump\u2019s personal and business tax returns, as demanded by Mr. Neal under the federal tax code. And on Tuesday, the White House instructed Donald F. McGahn II, the former White House counsel, to hold onto documents subpoenaed by House investigators because Mr. Trump might want to assert executive privilege over them. Even in the Senate, some moderate Republicans, like Susan Collins of Maine, have said they would at least like to hear from Mr. Mueller. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, and Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California issued a blistering joint statement in response: \u201cSenator McConnell\u2019s declaration of \u2018case closed\u2019 is a stunning act of political cynicism and a brazen violation of the oath we all take,\u201d they said. \u201cThe special counsel report laid out 11 instances of the president\u2019s obstruction, and left a raft of unanswered questions about coordination between the president\u2019s campaign and Russia. These are not trivial or political questions \u2014 they go to the wellspring of our democracy.\u201d Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, was similarly unsparing, given that his committee\u2019s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election is proceeding. But Republican leaders say questions of abuse of power and obstruction of justice are over. Mr. McConnell waved the congressional Democrats off their investigations, arguing that \u201crelitigating a two-and-a-half-year-old election result\u201d and continuing to traffic in \u201cfanciful conspiracy theories\u201d fixated on \u201cdelegitimizing the president\u201d would hurt the country. His comments are likely to be well received by the president, who has continued to complain that Democrats are subjecting him to \u201cthe highest level of presidential harassment\u201d in American history. Mr. McConnell\u2019s plea to move on, however, is sure to be met only with derision by House Democrats. Mr. McConnell also praised Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to \u201cmake Russia pay for its interference\u201d in the 2016 presidential election \u2014 and took President Barack Obama to task for not taking the threat Russia posed seriously enough. Recalling how in 2012, Mr. Obama mocked Mitt Romney, then the Republican presidential nominee, for naming Russia as America\u2019s greatest geopolitical threat, Mr. McConnell speculated that \u201cmaybe stronger leadership would have left the Kremlin less emboldened.\u201d That assertion is sure to infuriate Democrats. The Obama White House had appealed to congressional leadership during the 2016 campaign to issue a bipartisan, bicameral statement denouncing Russian interference, fearing that a statement from Mr. Obama would be interpreted as a partisan intervention in the election on behalf of Hillary Clinton. Mr. McConnell  blocked it. He has also blocked a bipartisan, nonbinding resolution in the Senate to make the full Mueller report public, arguing that Mr. Barr should be in charge of determining what was made public.",

      "content": " Democrats accused Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, of hypocrisy on Tuesday after he said Republicans would confirm a justice to the Supreme Court if a seat opened up amid the election campaign in 2020, even after denying President Barack Obama a similar opportunity in 2016. The senator made the remarks at a Chamber of Commerce event in Paducah, Ky., after an audience member asked what Senate Republicans would do if a Supreme Court justice died next year. \u201cOh, we\u2019d fill it,\u201d he responded with a grin, prompting laughter from the audience. When Mr. McConnell denied Judge Merrick B. Garland, Mr. Obama\u2019s choice to fill a Supreme Court vacancy, a hearing in 2016, the senator cited election-year \u201ctradition\u201d going back to 1880 in keeping the seat open until a new president could be inaugurated. Mr. McConnell\u2019s remark on Tuesday made it clear that was not his only consideration. It was the most direct acknowledgment yet that Senate Republicans would treat a judge nominated by a Republican president differently from one nominated by a Democratic president. After successfully keeping Judge Garland off the court, Republicans went on to cement a conservative majority when Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, who was nominated by President Trump, was confirmed in April 2017. Mr. Trump added another conservative, Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, to the court last year. Mr. McConnell\u2019s most common explanation for blocking Judge Garland \u2014 that a new president should get to fill a Supreme Court opening that occurs close to an election \u2014 struck Democrats as disingenuous at the time, and many said it looked even more so after Tuesday\u2019s comments. \u201cSenator McConnell is a hypocrite,\u201d Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, said on Twitter. Juli\u00e1n Castro, a Democratic presidential candidate, said on Twitter that Mr. McConnell\u2019s \u201cshamelessness at stealing a Supreme Court seat is appalling.\u201d In the past year, as bitterness lingered among Democrats over the episode, Mr. McConnell tried to reframe his reasoning to focus on the split control of government at the time. In 2016, Democrats held the White House while Republicans controlled the Senate, whereas Republicans now control both. He offered that explanation on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d in October, and David Popp, a spokesman for Mr. McConnell, cited the same explanation on CNN on Tuesday. Mr. McConnell did occasionally mention the divided government in 2016, but it was not his chief argument at the time and was frequently omitted from his remarks. Last October, when asked about the issue on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d he said, \u201cWhat I did was entirely consistent with what the history of the Senate\u2019s been in that situation going back to 1880.\u201d The last time a Republican-led Senate confirmed a nominee put forth by a Democratic president was 1895, when it confirmed Rufus W. Peckham after he was nominated by Grover Cleveland. Since then, Democratic-controlled Senates have approved 13 nominees by Republican presidents. Before 2016, there had been just seven election-year confirmation battles since the beginning of the 20th century. In the most recent case, Anthony M. Kennedy, who was appointed by President Ronald Reagan, was confirmed in 1988 by a Democratic Senate in a 97-to-0 vote after a grueling seven-month process. The only time a Senate has failed to confirm a nominee in an election year was 1968, when the nomination of Abe Fortas was withdrawn. Both the Senate and the White House were controlled by Democrats at the time. On the current court, two of the justices are in their 80s, and one of them, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 86, has suffered a series of health problems. In Mr. McConnell\u2019s remarks to the Paducah Chamber of Commerce, in his home state of Kentucky, he said that legislative accomplishments like tax reform could be undone by future administrations, but that Supreme Court confirmations could have a more lasting impact. \u201cWhat can\u2019t be undone is a lifetime appointment to a young man or woman who believes in the quaint notion that the job of a judge is to follow the law,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the most important thing we\u2019ve done for the country, which cannot be undone.\u201d",

      "content": " Marlow W. Cook, a moderate one-term Republican senator from Kentucky who gave Mitch McConnell his start in Washington politics but later criticized him for moving sharply to the right, died on Thursday at his home in Sarasota, Fla. He was 89. The cause was complications of a heart attack, his daughter Caroline Ely said. In the 1960s, Mr. Cook led a Republican resurgence in Jefferson County, which includes Louisville, ending a generation of Democratic dominance in a state where registered Democrats outnumbered Republicans two to one. He served two terms as an enormously popular county judge \u2014 an executive position analogous to mayor \u2014 before winning election as senator in 1968, succeeding Thruston B. Morton, also a moderate Republican, who had decided not to seek re-election. Mr. Cook enlisted Mr. McConnell to attract younger voters. A former state president of the Young Ripon Society, a moderate Republican organization, Mr. McConnell was just a year out of law school at the University of Kentucky. \u201cMarlow Cook gave me my first real opportunity in politics, as state youth chairman for his successful Senate campaign,\u201d Mr. McConnell, now the Senate majority leader, said on the floor of the Senate on Thursday. \u201cHe gave me an important opportunity in government too, as chief legislative assistant \u2014 basically what we now call legislative director \u2014 in his Senate office. I worked there for two years. I recall that time fondly. I remain very grateful for it.\u201d In that job, Mr. McConnell played a major role in Senator Cook\u2019s campaign for the Equal Rights Amendment, which passed both houses of Congress but was not ratified by the states. Another aide to Senator Cook was John Yarmuth, now a Democratic congressman from Kentucky. Mr. Cook later expressed surprise and dismay at Mr. McConnell\u2019s shift to the right. \u201cI am absolutely amazed he became a conservative,\u201d he told the magazine Mother Jones in 2014. He added, \u201cI don\u2019t mind someone being a conservative. But to stand up and say, \u2018I\u2019m the most conservative leader of the Senate ever\u2019? Mitch did that, and I thought, \u2018My God.\u2019\u201d Mr. Cook was particularly critical of Senator McConnell\u2019s opposition to the Affordable Care Act, more commonly known as Obamacare. \u201cIf he had any knowledge of the lack of health and medical facilities in the hills of Kentucky, he\u2019d know it\u2019s a problem we need to solve,\u201d he told Mother Jones. \u201cFor Mitch McConnell to decide the new health program is not good for Kentucky, it tells me he\u2019s not looking out for his own constituency.\u201d In Washington, Senator Cook earned a reputation as a liberal-leaning moderate with a natural charm that made him one of the most-liked members of the Senate. He could be unpredictable. At the request of President Richard M. Nixon, he served as floor manager of the ultimately unsuccessful effort to confirm Clement F. Haynsworth Jr. to the Supreme Court, and then he cast one of the decisive votes against the president\u2019s next candidate, G. Harrold Carswell. In retirement, Mr. Cook raised eyebrows when, in 2004, he endorsed a Democrat, Senator John Kerry, for president, citing a long list of disagreements with President George W. Bush, chiefly his decision to invade Iraq. \u201cI have been, and will continue to be, a Republican,\u201d he wrote in an op-ed article for The Louisville Courier-Journal. \u201cBut when we as a party send the wrong person to the White House, then it is our responsibility to send him home if our nation suffers as a result of his actions.\u201d Marlow Webster Cook was born on July 27, 1926, in Akron, in western New York State, where his father was an officer for the Louisville Cement Company. The family moved to Louisville when he was a teenager. After graduating from high school in 1944 he immediately enlisted in the Navy. He served on submarines in the European and Pacific theaters. He later enrolled in the University of Louisville, where he earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1948 and a law degree in 1950. He became involved in politics while practicing law, serving two terms as a state representative before winning election to county judge in 1961. One initiative was the purchase, for $34,000, of a broken-down paddle-wheeler, which was renovated and renamed the Belle of Louisville and became a popular tourist attraction and a symbol of the city. When opponents accused him of squandering the taxpayers\u2019 money on the boat, he calculated that the purchase had cost each citizen of the county 6 cents. He kept a jar of pennies on his desk to repay that sum to anyone who called or wrote to complain. In 1967, he ran in the Republican primary for governor, losing narrowly to Louie B. Nunn, who made an issue of Mr. Cook\u2019s religion \u2014 he was a Roman Catholic \u2014 and his liberal policies on desegregation. In his successful run for the Senate the next year, Mr. Cook, in an effort to appeal to supporters of the presidential candidate George C. Wallace, took a hawkish position on the Vietnam War and a tough line on law and order. In defeating the Democratic candidate, Katherine Peden, a former state commerce commissioner, Senator Cook became the first Roman Catholic in Kentucky to hold a major statewide post. He was defeated in 1974, in the aftermath of the Watergate scandals, by the state\u2019s governor, Wendell H. Ford. After practicing law in Washington, Mr. Cook moved to Florida in 1989. In addition to his daughter Caroline, he is survived by his wife, the former Nancy Remmers; three other daughters, Christy Cook, Nancy Spade and Louise Reed; a son, Webster; eight grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 For Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican entering his sixth month in his dream job of majority leader, the congressional struggle over National Security Agency surveillance powers produced a lose-lose-lose result. He failed to win even a brief extension of N.S.A. programs that lapsed Monday, interrupting an antiterror effort that he said he believed in strongly. Stymied on the extension front, he was then forced to put Congress on course to enact a House-passed N.S.A. overhaul that he opposes, saying he fears it will weaken national security. Topping it off, he provided the growing ranks of Senate Republican presidential candidates with evidence that the best way to get maximum attention is to break with the leadership and inject themselves into a big Senate fight at a crucial moment \u2014 just as Senator Rand Paul did Sunday with a series of objections, causing the N.S.A. programs to expire. \u201cEveryone has always assumed Senator McConnell has an ace up his sleeve, but Senator Paul called his bluff,\u201d said Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, the No. 3 Senate Democrat. \u201cYou don\u2019t leave yourself in that position.\u201d As the hours ticked by on Monday with the N.S.A. restricted in its operations, Mr. McConnell\u2019s growing impatience with Mr. Paul, his junior home-state colleague and a man he has endorsed for president, flared as Mr. McConnell went to the floor to seek an agreement to hasten Senate approval of the House bill. \u201cNow is the time for action,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no point in letting another day lapse when the endgame is absolutely clear to everyone. We know how this is going to end.\u201d While the end might indeed be in sight, Mr. Paul persisted again on Monday and would not relent unless he was allowed to offer some changes to the bill \u2014 an opportunity he was denied. So he objected, and Mr. McConnell, who had perhaps hoped to catch Mr. Paul napping, had no choice but to set another procedural vote for Tuesday morning. As Speaker John A. Boehner has painfully learned across the Rotunda, Mr. McConnell is finding that some of the new, ambitious conservative Republicans do not adhere to the old rules and ways of operating on Capitol Hill. Mr. McConnell got into this situation by making the tried-and-true Senate calculation that he could jam his colleagues into getting what he wanted by pushing the security agency fight right up to the June 1 deadline. Given recent history, the assumption was that no one would want to be responsible for letting Patriot Act protections enacted in the scary aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks be suspended. Other Senate Republicans said Mr. McConnell had repeatedly expressed confidence that he could win an extension, providing some breathing room to find a way to hold off the House measure. But Mr. Paul showed he was willing to take the political risk of allowing the N.S.A. programs to lapse, refusing to budge even as his presidential fund-raising continued, building off his challenge of the Senate establishment. Not unexpectedly, the failure to keep the surveillance program operating drew strong criticism from House and Senate Democrats. They suggested that Mr. McConnell had erred by using the week before Memorial Day to push trade legislation with no deadline when the N.S.A. pileup could be seen coming for months. \u201cThis is a completely foreseeable and completely unnecessary crisis,\u201d said Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader. She chastised Republicans for creating what she said was a national security vulnerability. Some Senate Republicans fumed privately as well. They said Mr. McConnell and Senator Richard Burr, the North Carolina Republican who is chairman of the Intelligence Committee, should have written an alternative to the House bill to give Republicans something to rally around. They said Mr. McConnell had put them in a difficult position by initially urging Republicans to block the House bill only to turn around Sunday night and encourage them to vote for it as a last resort. Senators do not like to look like they are flip-flopping, particularly when doing so does not gain them much \u2014 and in this case, the N.S.A. program ultimately went dark, at least temporarily. Almost as worrisome to some Republicans was the thought that Mr. Paul\u2019s success at exerting his influence over the Senate at a moment of crisis could encourage others to do the same. While he was seriously irritating his colleagues, Mr. Paul was gaining considerable news media attention. One Senate Republican wondered what that meant for coming showdowns over the debt limit and federal spending given Mr. McConnell\u2019s seeming inability to exhibit much influence over Mr. Paul. The decision to move ahead with the bipartisan House measure was painful both for Mr. McConnell and Mr. Burr given their strong reservations. Hoping to make improvements \u2014 and save some face \u2014 the Republican leadership was pushing changes to the legislation through amendments to be considered Tuesday. But if any of those changes are approved, and some could be, the delay in getting the security agency programs up and operating will be extended since the measure will have to go back to the House for more debate and approval. Democrats said they were perplexed that Mr. McConnell seemed willing to prolong the agony. Mr. McConnell was a master of leading the minority opposition in the Senate, confounding Senate Democrats and President Obama by putting the brakes on so many of their initiatives. Now he is in the driver\u2019s seat, but others are hitting the brakes, making for a rough ride for the majority leader.",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Last spring, Marc H. Morial, the president of the National Urban League, found himself in a place he has come to know well over the years, across a desk from Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, talking about public policy. Mr. Morial\u2019s question this time was pointed: What was going on with the confirmation vote for Loretta E. Lynch, President Obama\u2019s nominee for attorney general, which Mr. McConnell had been dragging out for months over an unrelated imbroglio with Democrats. \u201cHe said, \u2018I believe she will be confirmed,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Morial recalled. But what Mr. McConnell did not tell him \u2014 or anybody else for that matter \u2014 was that it would happen with his vote. While Mr. McConnell\u2019s aye in favor of Ms. Lynch may have startled many of his Republican colleagues, it was consistent with his nuanced, sometimes surprising, sometimes contentious record on civil rights that has placed him apart from some Republican colleagues and from some voters in his home state, Kentucky. In recent years, Mr. McConnell\u2019s longstanding commitment to civil rights legislation has come into conflict with his party\u2019s push for state-imposed limits on early voting, voter identification requirements and other measures that Democrats say are intended to disenfranchise minorities. Eyes will now turn to Mr. McConnell, an early voice calling for the removal of the Confederate battle flag from the South Carolina capitol, after a major skirmish in the House this week over the use of the flag on federal land. \u201cOne thing I am not in favor of erasing is our history,\u201d he said, referring to the removal of statues, not the House debate on the flag. \u201cThe Civil War was a part of our history and there were actually good people on both sides of that war.\u201d The tension can be seen in his own ambivalence about changes to civil rights laws proposed by some members of Congress, including measures that would bring back federal oversight of elections in some states. But Mr. McConnell\u2019s interest in race issues was inspired by his upbringing in Kentucky by parents who opposed segregation. It was fermented on the campus of the University of Louisville, where he encouraged students to march with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. It was reinforced by his internship in the office of Senator John Sherman Cooper, a Kentucky Republican who helped break the Southern-led filibuster of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It also surfaced during his first term in the Senate, when Mr. McConnell\u2019s vote helped Congress override President Ronald Reagan\u2019s veto of a measure imposing sanctions on South Africa during apartheid, and has persisted through his years in the United States Capitol, most recently last month, when Mr. McConnell stood before reporters and said that a statue of Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederacy, should be removed from Kentucky\u2019s Capitol. \u201cThis whole business of America moving past its original sin,\u201d Mr. McConnell said in an interview, \u201chas been over a big period during which I have lived.\u201d Mr. McConnell\u2019s strong feelings about racial equality began with his parents, whom he often refers to as \u201cvery enlightened Southerners\u201d who were involved in the National Urban League. \u201cI was born in North Alabama, and when I was a little kid, I remember segregated movie theaters, segregated drinking fountains, segregated schools,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had a day off for Robert E. Lee\u2019s birthday, along with Lincoln\u2019s. The Civil War was omnipresent.\u201d During college, he served as an intern in Washington and attended Dr. King\u2019s \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech in 1963 \u2014 \u201cYou could see a massive throng of humanity down to the memorial\u201d \u2014 and wrote a college editorial excoriating opponents of civil rights. He worked as an intern for Mr. Cooper, opening mail, much of which was from constituents unhappy with the senator\u2019s support for the Civil Rights Act. Mr. McConnell, 73, recalled, as he often does, asking Mr. Cooper how he could handle the overwhelming pressure. His boss told him, \u201cThere are times when you are supposed to lead, and other times to reflect the views of your state, and I think it is time to lead,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was pretty inspirational to a young guy just going to law school.\u201d These experiences combined to have a profound and lasting impact, Mr. McConnell and others said. \u201cMitch doesn\u2019t reveal a lot,\u201d said Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee and a contemporary of Mr. McConnell. \u201cBut we have had discussions about our parallel experiences. You couldn\u2019t be a student in the late \u201950s and \u201960s without racial injustice staring you in the face.\u201d Mr. McConnell spoke recently at the John Sherman Cooper Lecture Series, held at Somerset Community College in Kentucky. \u201cHe was my hero,\u201d Mr. McConnell said of Mr. Cooper, who died in 1991. \u201cIn all my years of public life, there\u2019s been no one from whom I\u2019ve learned more.\u201d In 1986, Mr. McConnell was among 31 Senate Republicans who voted to override President Reagan\u2019s veto of legislation imposing stiff economic sanctions on South Africa. At the time, he said of Mr. Reagan: \u201cI think he is wrong. We have waited long enough for him to come on board.\u201d In 2002, Mr. McConnell was one of the principal authors, with Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, of the Help America Vote Act, which helped modernize state voting systems after the debacle of the 2000 presidential election. \u201cBecause of that act,\u201d Mr. Dodd said in an interview, \u201cmillions more people in this country can vote now,\u201d he said, referring to the malfunctioning voting systems that were replaced because of the legislation, many of them in minority communities. \u201cAnd a big reason was Mitch McConnell.\u201d Help America Vote was intended to help all Americans vote, but the worst voting machines were in low-income minority areas. But in 2007, in keeping with his party\u2019s move to the right on voting rights, Mr. McConnell proposed an amendment to a Senate immigration bill that would have amended that same act to require that all voters show photo identification. Civil rights groups are now pressing Mr. McConnell to support a new wave of legislation that would curb racial profiling practices by law enforcement officials and that would restore voting rights provisions stripped away by the Supreme Court in 2013. That ruling allowed nine states, mostly in the South, to change their election laws without advance federal approval, known as preclearance. Mr. McConnell has shown little support for measures intended to strengthen that law, noting more than once that \u201cAmerica is very different from what it was in the 1960s.\u201d There is legislation in the House and the Senate that would reinstate federal supervision of elections in states where there has been a history of voter discrimination. Many Republicans have criticized these efforts as unfairly singling out states and as failing to address voter fraud. The N.A.A.C.P. gives Mr. McConnell poor grades on its congressional report card, largely because he has not supported President Obama\u2019s health care law and programs to aid the poor, but also because he has not voiced support for the voting rights and profiling measures. Civil rights leadership requires \u201ca continuation\u201d of progress toward equal treatment, said Hilary O. Shelton, a senior vice president at the N.A.A.C.P. \u201cIf you look at the Racial Profiling Act,\u201d Mr. Shelton added, referring to the 2013 law, \u201cwe are not seeing leadership coming from him, but if you asked anyone at the King Center, they would say Dr. King would have wanted a racial profiling act.\u201d Mr. Morial of the National Urban League said, \u201cHe is not committed to it, but I also have not heard him say he is opposed.\u201d \u201cHe knows how deeply we feel,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is a straight shooter. He is not going to duck or dodge. He is not going to sit in his office and tell me he is going to do something and not do it.\u201d Given the tilt to the right of the conference he now controls, Mr. McConnell was silent about how he would vote on Ms. Lynch\u2019s confirmation, and many assumed he would cast a no ballot, like many of his colleagues. After he voted in favor of her confirmation, he looked on with glee as several African-American women from the House came to the Senate to celebrate. \u201cI did kid my friend Sheila Jackson Lee,\u201d he said of the outspoken lawmaker from Texas, who like many Democrats was angry that it took so long to get the confirmation vote. \u201cI said, \u2018I don\u2019t remember you coming over and giving Dick Durbin trouble when he voted against Condoleezza Rice.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Where others see persistent flaws in race relations, Mr. McConnell says he sees great progress compared with what he witnessed as a youth in the South, as highlighted by the swift outrage across a broad spectrum of the country in response to the shooting of nine members of a black church in Charleston, S.C., last month. \u201cAmerica is a work in progress on this issue,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are always looking for opportunities to improve our country. I am actually pretty upbeat and positive about all the progress America has made with race relations.\u201d",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Before the election, it was clear that Democrats were looking at the very real prospect of scrapping the filibuster to keep Republicans from blocking the Supreme Court nominees of a President Hillary Clinton. Now the tables are turned. It is the Republicans who will control the White House, Senate and House \u2014 the coveted Washington trifecta. And that raises a crucial question: If Democrats in the even more narrowly divided Senate embrace the filibuster to block what could be a flood of legislation, would Republicans respond by eliminating the 60-vote threshold in order to push their priorities through on simple majority votes? In the afterglow of their election success, Republicans prefer not to discuss this unpleasant possibility. They would rather rhapsodize about a sunny legislative future in which the two parties work in harmony, negating the need for all those troublesome Senate cloture votes to try to break filibusters (a tactic that they, in fact, employed very effectively to stymie President Obama). \u201cI think what the American people are looking for is results,\u201d Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who will retain his majority leader title by virtue of surprising Republican victories, told reporters. \u201cAnd to get results in the Senate, as all of you know, it requires some Democratic participation and cooperation.\u201d At the same time, Mr. McConnell said that repealing the Affordable Care Act was a \u201cpretty high item on our agenda,\u201d and he predicted quick action. \u201cThe sooner we can go in a different direction, the better,\u201d he said. Democrats are certain to oppose that. Even if some red-state Democrats up for re-election in 2018 join Republicans, the repeal effort will most likely remain short of the 60 votes now needed. Republicans can use a special process known as reconciliation to avoid a filibuster. But that effort would take well into 2017 and would require passage of a congressional budget resolution, among other steps. Presumably, the newly installed president, Donald J. Trump, along with eager House Republicans and impatient legions of Trump supporters, would want to see the law repealed well before then, and they could apply enough pressure to lead to the filibuster\u2019s demise. Another development could spur a filibuster fight even sooner. Mr. Trump is likely to move quickly to fill the Supreme Court seat that Senate Republicans have kept empty for more than eight months. Senate Democrats say they hope that Mr. Trump follows tradition by consulting with them on his Supreme Court choice, and that he picks a nominee both parties are able to support. But they remain very unhappy about how Republicans treated Merrick B. Garland, the highly regarded federal appeals court judge whose nomination by Mr. Obama in March is now dead. Democrats may want some payback. So if Mr. Trump picks a conservative whom Democrats find objectionable, it is possible that they will do whatever they can to impede the choice, including a filibuster. That could lead to a retaliatory move by Republicans to eliminate the filibuster against Supreme Court nominees, the only judicial candidates exempted from a change Democrats engineered in 2013 that allowed filibusters against nominees to be broken by a simple majority vote. Mr. McConnell would not tip his hand this week on how he would respond to such a Democratic approach. But he did not rule out the so-called nuclear option: changing rules via a procedural vote on the floor instead of the 67 votes officially required. \u201cI would not anticipate any particular strategy that the Democrats might employ to defeat it or what we might do in reaction to that,\u201d he said. Mr. McConnell is what is known on Capitol Hill as an institutionalist, a strong believer in the traditions and practices of the Senate. He was very critical of the decision by Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, who is retiring this year, to rally his party into limiting filibusters against nominees in response to Republican delaying tactics. Mr. McConnell has said repeatedly that it is crucial to American democracy to respect the special rights of the minority party in the Senate, and that it would be a mistake to limit the filibuster, since the decision could backfire if his party fell out of power. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should act as if we\u2019re going to be in the majority forever,\u201d he said. It is not clear that Mr. McConnell, even if he wanted to, could round up enough votes from his own party to curtail the Senate filibuster, since some veteran Republican senators such as Susan Collins of Maine would probably be opposed. However, if Senate Democrats were able to frustrate the unified Republican government through the filibuster, the forces behind Mr. Trump\u2019s election and agenda \u2014 among his top priorities are major tax cuts and tough border security measures \u2014 would be likely to push Mr. McConnell and his colleagues to get rid of it. House conservatives and other top Republicans were already agitating for an end to the filibuster last year, and that was when Mr. Obama was still certain to veto bills he opposed. In addition, the 2018 electoral landscape is so favorable to Republicans that they are very likely to retain power for the entire four years of Mr. Trump\u2019s term, giving them a huge opening to rewrite the federal statute book if left unimpeded. Mr. McConnell loves the Senate rules and would be loath to change them. But he did not reverse the Democrats and restore the 60-vote threshold on most nominees when the Republicans took control in 2015. He might ultimately be persuaded to scuttle the filibuster on Supreme Court nominees and even on legislation if he felt it was justified and the time was right.",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Speaker Paul D. Ryan on Tuesday forcefully denounced Donald J. Trump\u2019s refusal to distance himself from the former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke. But Mr. Ryan did not shift from his position that he would support Mr. Trump if he became the Republican Party\u2019s presidential nominee, a perplexing contradiction that reflects the growing anxiety on Capitol Hill over the billionaire businessman\u2019s ascent. \u201cIf a person wants to be the nominee of the Republican Party, there can be no evasion and no games,\u201d Mr. Ryan told reporters in Washington after his weekly meeting with House Republicans. \u201cThey must reject any group or cause that is built on bigotry. This party does not prey on people\u2019s prejudices. We appeal to their highest ideals. This is the party of Lincoln.\u201d Mr. Ryan, who did not mention Mr. Trump by name, brought into sharp relief the intense struggle facing congressional Republicans \u2014 especially those in tough re-election fights \u2014 as they move to simultaneously run from Mr. Trump\u2019s positions and largely proclaim fealty to his increasingly possible rise to the top of their ticket. \u201cLet me make it perfectly clear, Senate Republicans condemn David Duke and the K.K.K., and his racism,\u201d Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, said Tuesday on Capitol Hill. \u201cThat is not the view of Republicans that have been elected to the United States Senate, and I condemn his comments in the most forceful way.\u201d Mr. McConnell stopped short of saying what only a very few congressional Republicans have said: that he will not pull the lever for Mr. Trump if he is the nominee. The inherent paradox of renouncing a candidate you also provisionally support was raised Tuesday to near contortionist levels. For instance, Republicans now repeatedly say they must support any Republican nominee over a Democrat largely to protect the Supreme Court seat that opened up with the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, a position that Mr. McConnell says they will not agree to fill until after the election. \u201cAny Republican nominee is going to have a better Supreme Court nominee,\u201d said Senator Cory Gardner, Republican of Colorado, moments after he said his first job was to show America that \u201cTrump is a wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing.\u201d But Republicans acknowledge that they have no proof that Mr. Trump would pick the conservative jurist they crave. To wit: Mr. Trump has repeatedly embraced policies and political figures disliked by his party. He once said that Paul Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, whose policies fueled the recession in President Ronald Reagan\u2019s first term and who then became a trusted economic adviser to the presidential candidate Barack Obama, was a great pick for the nation\u2019s central bank job. Congressional Republicans \u2014 dominated by the party\u2019s conservative wing \u2014 dislike many of Mr. Trump\u2019s policies, are out of step with their front-runner on social issues and are embarrassed by his antics. Yet they insist that at the end of the long, arduous day, none of those traits would be disqualifying. \u201cWe will have to work on changing some of his ideas,\u201d said Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, smiling weakly. \u201cHe\u2019s a good businessman.\u201d And many said that while his views were at odds with voters in their states, Mr. Trump\u2019s overall candidacy was not, and so they would support him \u2014 if for no other reason than they will need his voters, too. \u201cI have a primary,\u201d said Senator Johnny Isakson, Republican of Georgia, who added he would not endorse anyone in the race. It is almost as if Republicans are dating someone they will not introduce to their mother, but have reluctantly agreed to marry because they cannot do better. \u201cFor a group with 9 percent favorables telling people how to vote,\u201d said Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, an outspoken critic of Mr. Trump, \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to work.\u201d One exception is Senator Ben Sasse, the freshman Republican from Nebraska, who began a one-man attack on Mr. Trump on social media, explaining why he would never vote for him. A House Republican, Representative Scott Rigell of Virginia, did proclaim Tuesday that \u201clove for our country eclipses my loyalty to our party\u201d as he declared he would never support \u201ca nominee so lacking in the judgment, temperament and character needed to be our nation\u2019s commander in chief.\u201d But Mr. Rigell has already announced his retirement at the end of the year. Yet for all the wishful thinking about Mr. Trump\u2019s imminent demise \u2014 they said repeatedly that even if he cleaned up in Tuesday\u2019s primaries, he could still lose the nomination fight \u2014 Republicans have not strongly coalesced around an alternative. Many Senate Republicans were behind the now-failed campaign of former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida. Support for other candidates has been scattered. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida has the endorsement of about a dozen senators, while Senator Ted Cruz has none. Still, they press on. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be Donald Trump,\u201d snapped the usually affable Mr. Gardner, who is trying to elevate Mr. Rubio. Mr. McConnell, who has spent much of his public life pressing against the most flagrant bigotry in politics, is in a particularly tough spot by not fully dismissing Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy over the David Duke episode. And while Mr. Ryan has been careful to try to ignore Mr. Trump\u2019s garden-variety outbursts and name calling, he becomes agitated over remarks that he feels violate the inclusiveness of the party. \u201cThis is fundamental,\u201d Mr. Ryan said. \u201cAnd if someone wants to be our nominee, they must understand this. I hope this is the last time I need to speak out on this race.\u201d Democrats are using the issue to pummel Republicans. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the minority leader, was sharply critical of Mr. Ryan on Tuesday and his refusal to say he would not support Mr. Trump. \u201cTalk is cheap,\u201d Mr. Reid sneered.",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 As he prepares to guide Republicans out of the wilderness of the Senate minority, Senator Mitch McConnell, the incoming majority leader, knows his real problem is not corralling mavericks in his party like Senator Ted Cruz. It is persuading other Senate Republicans conditioned to voting no that it is time to vote yes. \u201cOne of my challenges is to try to convince some of my members that passing an appropriations bill is a good thing, not a bad thing,\u201d Mr. McConnell said during an interview in which he looked ahead to assuming command of the Senate on Jan. 6. Mr. McConnell, who was instrumental in holding Republicans together against President Obama and Democratic initiatives, acknowledges that changing the mind-set of opposition he helped instill in his colleagues will be crucial to advancing legislation that will attract Democratic support and force Mr. Obama into difficult choices over whether to sign measures pushed by his adversaries. And that is why his focus will be lawmakers he thinks he can meld into a governing coalition. \u201cThere are two kinds of people in politics,\u201d Mr. McConnell said after the recent blowup when Mr. Cruz, the fiery Texan, and Senator Mike Lee of Utah, another firebrand, forced the Senate into a year-end session that handed Democrats more time to confirm dozens of presidential nominees on their way out the door. \u201cThose who want to make a point and those who want to make a difference. \u201cAll of us from time to time make a point,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201cBut it is time now to make a difference.\u201d Such comments will no doubt infuriate those who see Mr. McConnell as the personification of knee-jerk opposition to the president over the past six years and the architect of a deliberate campaign to deny Mr. Obama a record of accomplishment and block Democratic initiatives like an increase in the minimum wage. Democrats consider Mr. McConnell a historic abuser of the filibuster both to thwart legislation and nominations and to force Democrats to consume so much floor time on formerly routine matters that they had less opportunity to get bigger things done. Mr. McConnell has no regrets and makes no apologies. He says it was Democrats who froze Republicans out and employed the Senate more as a political platform than a legislative one. \u201cIt was not about legislation,\u201d said Mr. McConnell, who easily survived a primary challenge from the right and went on to win his general election for a sixth term representing Kentucky, despite being a top target of national Democrats. \u201cIt had nothing to do with an outcome. The Senate basically didn\u2019t do squat for years. I don\u2019t think most members of the Senate wanted it run that way.\u201d Mr. McConnell sees himself as the man to make the chamber operative again, or as functional as the often plodding institution can be. He says he has received encouragement from Democrats, and has pledged repeatedly to allow freewheeling floor debate, with both sides able to offer amendments, in contrast to the preference of Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the current majority leader, who will assume Mr. McConnell\u2019s role as the voice of the minority. Mr. McConnell has already extended the workweek, scheduling the Senate to be in session the first six weeks of 2015 and meet on Fridays, a major departure. His approach seems to be to let the Senate exhaust its pent-up demand for politically charged \u201cgotcha\u201d amendments and then get down to business. \u201cIt will more chaotic, there will probably be later nights,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201cThe goal is to let the Senate express its views.\u201d Mr. McConnell has already announced that the first bill Senate Republicans put on the floor will be one expediting the Keystone XL pipeline, which fell one vote short of the 60 required to pass in a post-election push last month and will likely now head to the president\u2019s desk. He is also being pressed by Mr. Reid to quickly take up the terrorism risk insurance program, which expired after it was blocked at the end of the 113th Congress. And he faces pressure from prominent Senate Republicans to reverse the 2013 rules change by Democrats that lowered the threshold for breaking a filibuster on nominees from 60 to a simple majority, a change that allowed the president to put almost 100 judges on the federal bench in the last year. Attendees at a recent private Republican meeting said that Senator John McCain of Arizona was emphatic that Republicans should open the year by overturning the change. But Mr. McConnell does not seem inclined to push ahead, despite earlier indications from him that Republicans should do so. From his perspective, the quickest way to overturn it would be through the parliamentary tactic that Democrats employed, but Mr. McConnell said that would be repeating the same abuse of the rules. He suggested instead that the Rules Committee would explore what to do and see if there were 67 votes \u2014 the usual requirement for a rules change \u2014 for restoring the threshold. As for what happens after the Keystone bill, things get a little uncertain. During a private luncheon with Mr. Obama this month, Mr. McConnell said they focused on three areas where they believe they could potentially find agreement: tax reform, trade promotion and infrastructure spending, areas often cited by the president as well. But that kind of legislation will take some time to emerge. Though there is no chance of repealing the Affordable Care Act while Mr. Obama is in office, Mr. McConnell indicated Republicans would give it another try before turning to individual elements of the law that some Democrats also support changing. Those include defining full-time work as 40 hours a week rather than 30, repealing the requirement on individuals to buy insurance, and eliminating a new tax on medical devices. \u201cAll of those are candidates for separate consideration, in addition to putting the new Senate on record about how it feels about starting over,\u201d he said of health care. Mr. McConnell has also expressed support for legislation banning abortions after 20 weeks, though he said the timing of when to consider that legislation had not been set. As for immigration policy, the leader seemed unclear himself just how the new Republican Congress would approach the issue, saying only that \u201cwe will be back at it in February.\u201d He fervently believes the annual must-pass appropriations bills are the best weapon Republicans have for undoing Obama administration policies they oppose. Mr. McConnell\u2019s strategy is to pass each of the 12 spending bills individually and mix restraints on administration policy and rule making in the bills, along with spending favored by the White House, leaving the questions of approving the measure or shutting government agencies in the president\u2019s hands. \u201cMany of my members are not used to voting for appropriations bills,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201cBut if we are going to pursue our agenda to push back against the bureaucratic overreach seemingly on steroids for the last five or six years, we need to put appropriations bills on the president\u2019s desk and make him make a choice.\u201d Mr. McConnell has been part of the leadership in both the minority and the majority, but has never before been majority leader. But for years, he has observed those holding the position. \u201cI have studied this job and reached my own conclusions about how it ought to be done,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201cIt has been a long wait.\u201d",

      "content": " In a speech on the Senate floor, Mitch McConnell on Wednesday denounced Democratic legislation intended to increase voter turnout as a \u201cpower grab,\u201d singling out one proposal as particularly nefarious: making Election Day a federal holiday. \u201cThis is the Democrat plan to restore democracy?\u201d said Mr. McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the Senate majority leader, chuckling to himself. \u201cA power grab that\u2019s smelling more and more like exactly what it is.\u201d His remarks set off a backlash from Democrats in Congress, who questioned why anyone would oppose efforts to clear obstacles for voting. The criticism extended to social media, where people accused Mr. McConnell of being afraid of increased voter turnout. Republicans have often put forward measures, like laws requiring voter identification or restricting early voting, that Democrats say are devised to suppress turnout. \u201cIs it a Democratic Party \u2018power grab,\u2019 as Mitch says, if we make voting more convenient for everyone?\u201d former Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California, said on Twitter on Thursday. \u201cWhat is Mitch afraid of? Answer: the people.\u201d Representative Ted Deutch, a Florida Democrat, shared a video of Mr. McConnell\u2019s remarks and said, \u201cAn Election Day holiday WOULD be a power grab,\u201d adding: \u201cIt would be the American people grabbing power back from the wealthy special interests that dominate Washington because @senatemajldr & others prefer that it be hard to vote.\u201d The target of Mr. McConnell\u2019s comments, a House of Representatives bill titled For the People Act of 2019, is the first major legislation by the new Democratic-controlled House and puts forward seven major changes to elections nationwide. The proposals are wide ranging, including changes to how people register to vote and new requirements for states to secure voting systems. Among the proposals: Voters could register in person on the day of an election, an option that is currently offered in only 18 states and the District of Columbia, and could cast ballots in federal elections during an early-voting period, which all but 11 states already allow. Permitting same-day registration could increase voter turnout by three percentage points, the equivalent of about 3.8 million additional voters in the 2016 presidential election, according to studies. The bill would also allow automatic registration for eligible people. The bill also seeks to remove a major hurdle that prevents people from voting: work. A census survey of roughly 19 million registered voters who did not participate in the 2016 election found that 14.3 percent, or about 2.7 million people, said they were too busy to vote. The legislation proposes making Election Day, the first Tuesday in November, a public holiday just like Washington\u2019s Birthday, Independence Day and Christmas. It would grant the federal government\u2019s two million full-time employees a paid day off, and would make companies, many of which shut down on federal holidays, more likely to grant their workers a day off. Mr. McConnell derided that idea as \u201cgenerous new benefits for federal bureaucrats and government employees.\u201d \u201cJust what America needs: another paid holiday,\u201d said Mr. McConnell, echoing comments he made about the bill in an op-ed essay in The Washington Post this month. The broad legislation from Democrats also targets hot-button issues surrounding voter suppression and the fairness of elections. To combat gerrymandering, the bill would strip the power to set congressional boundaries from state legislatures, 30 of which are controlled by Republicans, and hand it over to new independent commissions. And to try to counteract the influence of money in politics, the bill would move toward public financing of elections. The bill would also weaken voter identification laws in states by allowing voters without identification to vote if they provide a \u201csworn written statement.\u201d Republican advocates of such ID restrictions insist that they are needed to stop voter fraud, though studies have concluded that in-person fraud is very rare. Democrats have criticized the measures as attempts to suppress the votes of people of color. Voter turnout in the United States is fairly low compared with most other developed countries. About 56 percent of voting-age Americans cast ballots in the last presidential election, a slight increase from 2012 but lower than 2008, according to the Pew Research Center. In Germany, by comparison, voter turnout in 2017 was 76 percent. Some countries with the highest turnout in the world make it easier for their citizens to cast ballots. In Australia, voting is required by law, and citizens also make a party out of it: Elections are held on Saturdays, with people gathering for barbecues and get-togethers. Turnout is typically over 90 percent. Also high on the list, according to Pew: Israel and South Korea, which both have national holidays on their election days.",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 More than 30 times over the past six years, Congress has mustered the money only for short-term extensions of the federal highway trust fund, the equivalent of repeatedly putting $5 of gas in an empty tank. With the highway fund set to hit empty on July 31, the House on Wednesday passed another modest squirt into the tank, an $8 billion, five-month transportation patch, by a vote of 312 to 119. It did so with a promise that by Dec. 18, Congress will pass \u2014 and President Obama will sign \u2014 a major overhaul of the international business tax code that will yield the money to fund a long-term transportation bill. But that approach has one important doubter, Senator Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican and the majority leader, who thinks the prospects of such largess are about as likely as winning the lottery. \u201cThere are a lot of people who are skeptical outside the committee,\u201d said Representative Dave Reichert, a Washington Republican who leads the House Ways and Means subcommittee on taxation. \u201cBut every effort we make, I have to believe, is possible.\u201d Highway funding, which once routinely had bipartisan support, has now become yet another source of division, this time within the Republican Party that controls Congress. House Republicans \u2014 bolstered, oddly enough, by the White House and a top Senate Democrat, Chuck Schumer of New York \u2014 are adamant that by keeping the pressure on, the highway trust fund could be the ticket to a long-sought rewrite of the corporate tax code. Mr. McConnell wants to be done with the highway bill before it is pulled into the maw of presidential politics. He is trying to cobble together enough spending cuts and tax-law enforcement provisions to fashion a bill that will, at the very least, get the trust fund through 2016. Democrats \u2014 and some Republicans \u2014 say the answer has been staring Congress in the face for years: Raise the federal gas tax, which has become a less effective source for financing the nation\u2019s crumbling roads, bridges and other infrastructure because cars and trucks have become more fuel efficient and drivers are buying less gas. \u201cThere\u2019s no excuse to keep torturing people,\u201d said Representative Earl Blumenauer, Democrat of Oregon who is pushing a 15-cent-per-gallon fuel tax increase. \u201cThis is a fool\u2019s errand. We ought to step up.\u201d An estimated 140,000 bridges are breaking down across the country, and about 40 percent of the nation\u2019s pavement has broken down to the point that it can no longer be tarred over but should be rebuilt, said Representative Peter A. DeFazio, Democrat of Oregon. But for years, battered roads, aging transit systems and overtaxed airports have been no match for Republican vows to never raise taxes and Mr. Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign promise to raise taxes only on families earning at least $250,000. The most ardent conservatives in Congress have even argued that the federal government should get out of the infrastructure business and let state and local governments deal with the nation\u2019s transportation system. But in the last two years, an idea that began as an outlandish proposal by a freshman House Democrat, John Delaney of Maryland, has evolved into the closest thing to consensus on infrastructure funding. The idea: Rewrite the tax code governing United States corporations operating internationally to end the unintended incentive for those companies to leave trillions of dollars in profits overseas, and add a component taxing those overseas profits. Much of the revenue from that one-time \u201ctransition\u201d tax would be dedicated to infrastructure spending. Currently, the federal corporate income tax of 35 percent applies to overseas profits only when they are brought home. That has persuaded companies to leave an estimated $2 trillion abroad, in cash or reinvested in overseas operations. Policy makers would like to create some kind of minimum tax that would be paid annually on such profits, whether they are brought home or not, ending the incentive to leave the money overseas. A one-time tax would be levied on the money that has accumulated over the last decades. Mr. Obama\u2019s Treasury Department has written a version of the plan that would produce $220 billion for a major infrastructure program. Former Representative Dave Camp, a Michigan Republican and the Ways and Means Committee chairman, wrote one before retiring last year that his successor, Representative Paul D. Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, has embraced. And last week, Mr. Schumer and Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, produced their own. \u201cThis plan gives us our best opportunity to produce and pass a long-term bill to rebuild America\u2019s roads, bridges and other infrastructure this year,\u201d Mr. Ryan said after the House vote. The Senate, however, was unmoved. \u201cWe\u2019re not interested in a short-term bill,\u201d said Senator James M. Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma and chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. Even Mr. Schumer appeared on Wednesday to be taking a more realistic view of the prospects of a major corporate tax bill by the end of the year. \u201cThe House prefers the international tax way to do this. It certainly gets you a large sum of money that would get broad bipartisan support,\u201d Mr. Schumer said. \u201cBut let\u2019s face it. There are a lot of details that would have to be worked out in tax reform, so if there\u2019s another, more immediate proposal that would be long term and have a robust funding increase, it\u2019s something I\u2019d look at.\u201d Senators are struggling to find ways to pay for a longer-term bill without a tax increase. Mr. McConnell has put together a series of proposals, many of them measures to tighten tax-law compliance, others to trim spending. One envisions selling oil from the nation\u2019s Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which is supposed to be tapped only for energy emergencies. Another idea would tap the huge legal settlements that the largest banks have reached with the government over the housing issues that precipitated the financial collapse of 2008. Altogether, they would approach $60 billion, enough roughly for a four-to-five-year highway bill. But Democrats are protesting one of the largest parts, a cut to the way federal employee retirement benefits are calculated. Without that element, about $10 billion and a year would have to be shaved off the highway bill. Protests are also likely over drawing on the bank settlements and the petroleum reserve. Mr. McConnell plans on having a bill on the Senate floor much of next week. Just what it would look like is still unknown.",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Mitch McConnell and Lamar Alexander go way back. The two Southern Republicans met in Washington in 1969 when Mr. Alexander was a promising young aide at the Nixon White House and Mr. McConnell an up-and-coming legislative assistant to Senator Marlow W. Cook of Kentucky. The story goes that Senator Howard H. Baker Jr. suggested to Mr. Alexander, his fellow Tennessean, that he should look up Mr. McConnell, that he was a \u201csmart young man and I think you\u2019d like him.\u201d A nearly 50-year friendship and political alliance was born. In his book \u201cThe Long Game,\u201d Mr. McConnell, now the Senate majority leader, says of Mr. Alexander: \u201cLamar would go on to become one of my closest confidantes and a very good friend.\u201d Not many people are considered a close, let alone the closest, confidant of the notoriously reticent leader. But deep friendship aside, Mr. McConnell will be extremely cautious in moving ahead with the health care compromise that Mr. Alexander struck with Senator Patty Murray, a Washington Democrat, in an effort to stabilize the insurance exchanges for those buying coverage under the Affordable Care Act. And considering that President Trump is giving mixed signals on the proposal and that many Republicans in both the Senate and House are already opposed to it, the outlook for the rare bipartisan deal is murky at best. With Mr. McConnell\u2019s blessing, Mr. Alexander engaged in a concerted effort to find a compromise with Ms. Murray, the senior Democrat on the health committee that Mr. Alexander leads. The goal was for Congress to officially appropriate the subsidies paid to make insurance more affordable for lower-income Americans while giving states more freedom in regulating insurance \u2014 an approach favored by Republicans. The subsidies, estimated at $7 billion this year, were challenged in federal court by the House in 2014 and found unconstitutional because Congress had not approved them. Mr. Trump announced last week that he was cutting them off and Mr. Alexander said he feared millions of people could now find insurance out of their financial reach. Despite the serious negotiations, there was no firm commitment that a compromise would reach the Senate floor if one could be struck. In fact, Mr. Alexander deferred to Mr. McConnell last month when Mr. McConnell wanted to take one last shot at overturning the health care law. He broke off his talks with Ms. Murray, resuming them only when the repeal effort faltered once again. All sides agree that Mr. Trump \u2014 in conversations with Mr. Alexander and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader \u2014 strongly encouraged the bipartisan talks and initially seemed to embrace the agreement to restore the subsidies as a way to buy time for another repeal push. So backers of the plan were blindsided when the president said on Twitter on Wednesday that he could not back what he considered an insurance industry bailout. Mr. Schumer said the president was undercutting himself by wavering on deals he had helped set in motion, not just on health care but also on issues like immigration. Mr. Schumer suggested that Mr. Trump caved to conservative opposition to the health care compromise. \u201cThis president cannot govern if whenever the hard right frightens him and says, \u2018Jump,\u2019 he says, \u2018How high?\u2019\u201d Mr. Schumer said. Backers of the compromise face a tough task in selling the idea to many Republicans who would now be voting not to repeal the health care law, but to temporarily prop it up to avoid a breakdown in the marketplace. In addition, many on Capitol Hill say the compromise could be an important first step toward stabilizing the overall program, making future attempts to repeal it even more difficult. Mr. Trump\u2019s view will be crucial. His endorsement could provide important political cover for those nervous about voting to bolster the health care law while his opposition could cause Republicans to flee, fearing they will come under attack from the president and his allies. Mr. Alexander is not retreating. Trying to build momentum, he and Ms. Murray introduced the legislation on Thursday along with two dozen leading Republican and Democratic co-sponsors \u2014 an almost unheard-of event on a major bill in this highly polarized environment. Among Republicans backing the measure were Senators Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, long active in health policy; Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, the authors of the most recent repeal plan; Bob Corker, Mr. Alexander\u2019s Tennessee colleague who has been feuding with the president; and the group who thwarted Republican repeal efforts, John McCain of Arizona, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. \u201cI don\u2019t believe Congress will want to fail to deal with a problem that will hurt millions of Americans if we allow it to continue,\u201d Mr. Alexander said. He and Ms. Murray said that they had built in protections to make sure the money went to consumers and that it was a mischaracterization to call it an industry bailout. They said both sides gave substantial ground in the talks. Ms. Murray told fellow Democrats this week that it was the toughest bargaining she had been involved in as a senator. \u201cIt sends a powerful message that when members of Congress decide to get past our talking points and take a few steps out of our partisan corners, there is a lot we can agree on and a lot we can get done,\u201d Ms. Murray said of the negotiation. But to a large degree, the ultimate success of the talks depends on Mr. McConnell. He has been quiet so far about the bill and whether he would push it forward. The Senate would no doubt have to give it a strong vote for the plan to have any chance of moving through the House. The support from a growing list of Republican co-sponsors is no guarantee that the Senate will consider the bill if Mr. McConnell views it as too politically risky. He refused to bring to the floor last year a bipartisan criminal justice overhaul that had broad support because of political considerations \u2014 despite the fact that Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican, was a chief author. Mr. Alexander has repeatedly predicted that some version of his new legislation will become law by the end of the year. For him to be proved right, he is going to need some help from his good friend Mitch McConnell.",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Senator Mitch McConnell has long antagonized Democrats with his tactics. Now he just has them perplexed, wondering why he would unilaterally block a Supreme Court nominee and potentially put vulnerable Republicans at risk with control of the Senate at stake in November. Mr. McConnell, so crafty that he devised a way for Republicans to raise the federal debt limit by voting against it, has his reasons. So, what\u2019s in his head? First, Mr. McConnell, who strove for years to become majority leader, would consider it malpractice to wave through an Obama administration nominee who would reconfigure the ideological balance of the court. The conservative court is the Republican bulwark against the march of social and demographic change, and he is not about to let President Obama, who has less than a year remaining in office, appoint a third justice if he can prevent it. \u201cIf you are Senate majority leader and you are actively giving up the court for the first time in a generation, what do you have the Senate majority for?\u201d said Josh Holmes, a Republican strategist and former chief of staff to Mr. McConnell. \u201cIf you have an argument to stop it, make your argument.\u201d For Mr. McConnell, his nearly immediate decision after Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s death to block even a hearing for a replacement reflected the leader\u2019s persistent problems with his party\u2019s more conservative wing. Activists on the right do not entirely trust Mr. McConnell, seeing him as representative of an entrenched Republican get-along attitude, and they backed an unsuccessful primary challenge against him in 2014. Now, the conservative groups and far-right politicians who used to denigrate Mr. McConnell are praising his courage for standing up to the White House. \u201cTo his credit, Mitch McConnell jumped out early and led,\u201d said Michael A. Needham, the head of Heritage Action for America, a group that promotes conservative policy. \u201cConservatives are rallying behind Senate Republicans because of the generational impact the next Supreme Court justice will have on our nation.\u201d By moving quickly, Mr. McConnell also got out ahead of Senator Ted Cruz, his fellow Republican and occasional nemesis from Texas, who might have savaged Senate colleagues if they showed any inclination to consider Mr. Obama\u2019s nominee. Siding with the right could limit primary challenges against Republican incumbents not just this year but in 2018, when Republicans might be fighting to retake the Senate should they lose it in November. Mr. McConnell and his lieutenants have made an additional calculation: The nomination battle does not pose that big a threat in a year when they believe it is more important to drive their core voters to the polls, which the court fight will do. They do not rate the refusal to consider a nominee as anywhere near fatal for their embattled incumbents in states like Illinois, Missouri, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. And Republicans are very comfortable with their message of \u201clet the people decide,\u201d which they think is easy for voters to grasp. \u201cThis is something that highly motivates the Democrats\u2019 base and something that motivates the Republican base, so it is pretty much we are back at the line of scrimmage,\u201d said Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican and a former chairman of the Senate Republican Campaign Committee. Polls show that independents side with Democrats on the call to at least consider a nomination, but Mr. McConnell and his advisers are confident that those Americans will cast their ballots based on a range of issues rather than just the court. The court fight also could prompt conservatives, who have not been that excited about Senate Republicans, to put real energy and money into the campaigns. To many in the anti-abortion and pro-gun movements, there is no bigger issue than maintaining conservative control of the Supreme Court. That potential makes the risk worth it to Mr. McConnell, even if it means discarding the considerable effort he made at reversing a Republican reputation for Senate obstructionism. While Senate Republicans have essentially united behind Mr. McConnell\u2019s approach, there are murmurings of discontent. Some say Mr. McConnell should have at least held a conference call among Republicans before assuming such a politically charged stance. But Mr. McConnell, worried about members \u2014 who were scattered during a recess \u2014 taking positions they might later have to reverse, felt he had to act decisively. Perhaps the biggest question is why Mr. McConnell is drawing such a hard line against even meeting the nominee or conducting a hearing, and in doing so handing Democrats and editorial pages around the country the argument that Senate Republicans are refusing to do their fundamental duty. Republicans have become well practiced at slow-walking nominees and stalling legislation. Some are asking, why not just conduct hearings, review the nominee and then turn thumbs down? Mr. McConnell and his team worry that once such a Senate process begins, it becomes unpredictable and hard to control, particularly if the nominee seems well qualified and reasonable. Their thinking is that it is better to stop the confirmation cold. When Mr. Obama announces his choice \u2014 probably within the next week or so \u2014 Republicans will argue that their resistance has nothing to do with that individual. Mr. McConnell is widely recognized for his keen political instincts, and he may prove to have handled the court fight adroitly. But this is a highly unusual situation, complicated by an election season when Republicans could be running with Donald J. Trump as the party\u2019s presidential nominee. If it turns out he has misread the situation, he and his Senate Republicans could pay a big price in November and beyond.",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Mitch McConnell excels at devising crafty ways for Senate Republicans to avoid paying a high price on politically explosive issues. Take, for instance, his ingenious 2011 plan to clear the way for increases in the federal debt limit without Republican fingerprints. The McConnell maneuver turned the always-contentious process on its head and allowed Republicans to register their opposition to the increases while simultaneously permitting the necessary rise in the debt limit to avoid an economic meltdown. Even critics tipped their hats. Mr. McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, is going to need all the creativity he can muster to escape his current predicament. The Senate\u2019s Republican health care plan is in real trouble, and the fight that will be renewed next week on Capitol Hill is exposing the limits of Mr. McConnell\u2019s prowess in bending his colleagues and the Senate to his will. Deep understanding of Senate procedures and shrewd political instincts can only get you so far when many of your colleagues are truly anxious and fear the consequences of taking major action on health care policy. \u201cIt could not be more different from the difficulty of raising the debt limit because it is policy that affects millions of Americans and health care is so personal,\u201d said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, who is among those who have balked at her party\u2019s plan. Mr. McConnell knew his best chance to pass the bill was a quick strike before the Fourth of July recess, and he was right. As expected, the weeklong break has only complicated his already difficult task. Even usually certain Republican votes such as Senators Jerry Moran of Kansas and John Hoeven of North Dakota have joined the cadre of Republicans expressing resistance to the health care proposal, creating more distance between Mr. McConnell and the magic number of 50 votes needed to pass the bill. At the same time, conservative advocacy groups have intensified their demand that Republicans follow through on their repeated promises to repeal former President Barack Obama\u2019s health care bill or incur their wrath. They have also gotten behind a proposal by two Republican senators, Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah, that would move the health care proposal to the right and potentially drive off more support than it gathers. \u201cRepealing Obamacare was the central and most explicit promise of G.O.P. Senate candidates for eight years,\u201d Ralph Reed, the head of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, wrote on Facebook  this week. \u201cThe Senate must act now to repeal Obamacare to keep trust with the American people. To fail to do so will have far-reaching consequences for our health care system, our economy, and at the ballot box in 2018.\u201d Mr. McConnell has expressed mounting frustration at the inability of the unified Republican government to make progress on health care and other issues. \u201cThe American people said, \u2018We elected a Republican president, a Republican House and a Republican Senate and we want to see some results,\u2019\u201d he told an audience in Kentucky over the recess. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t say anything other than I agree with you. But it is not easy, and we are going to continue to wrestle with this and try to get it done.\u201d \u201cNo action is not an option,\u201d he emphasized. That remark seemed aimed at quelling calls to simply repeal the law, an alternative that faces steep procedural obstacles because it would require Democratic votes and Democrats will not provide them. On Thursday, Mr. McConnell again suggested that Republicans might find themselves in negotiations with Democrats on a modest plan to shore up the existing health insurance exchanges if they cannot advance their own legislation. His comment both laid the groundwork for a defeat while trying to provide an incentive for Republicans to get behind the leadership plan. The health care fight does not play to Mr. McConnell\u2019s typical strengths. It is an extremely complex policy matter, and Mr. McConnell has often reveled more in tactics and procedure than the arcana of community rating and adverse selection. Even some fellow Republicans acknowledge that Mr. McConnell\u2019s refusal to allow hearings on the health care proposal has backfired, denying Republican lawmakers the opportunity to hear from experts, gauge the strengths and weaknesses of the legislation, and discern potential lines of attack as well as the support for any changes. Republicans are finding how constituents respond when Congress tries to take a benefit away. The closest comparison might be the decision in 1989 to repeal a new Medicare catastrophic coverage law. But it was overturned in only about a year with the enthusiastic approval of the people who were supposed to benefit from it. The Affordable Care Act has had much more time to become enmeshed in the health care system, with millions of people relying on it \u2014 especially those receiving guaranteed coverage for pre-existing conditions. The beneficiaries of the law are now making their sentiments clearly known. \u201cI think it is so difficult for Mitch to thread the needle on this given the narrow majority in the Senate,\u201d Ms. Collins said. \u201cI just don\u2019t see how he does it. But I don\u2019t ever underestimate his abilities.\u201d Mr. McConnell has had failures in the past, like his inability to prevent the 2013 government shutdown. But he has more often fashioned a way out that few others saw, whether it was cutting a deal on student loans and transportation spending or keeping the Congress and the country from plunging over a fiscal cliff. He has compared the current situation to a Rubik\u2019s cube, where he is busily twisting and turning until he finally lines up the elusive 50 votes. But in this case, he is discovering that there is no solution within easy reach.",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 The top two Republicans in Congress are divided when it comes to divided government. Speaker Paul D. Ryan says he has had it with Republicans and Democrats sharing power, complaining that it breeds dysfunction and prevents major accomplishments. In contrast, Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, says those periods when the parties split control of Congress and the White House are the ideal time to get big things done. One of these Republican leaders \u2014 their differing views shaped by their individual experiences and the characteristics of their chambers \u2014 is likely to get an opportunity to prove his political theory correct next year. While there is a chance that Donald J. Trump will win the White House and Republicans will hold the House and Senate, current polling suggests it is more likely that Hillary Clinton will win the presidency and Republicans will more narrowly control one or both chambers of Congress. Such an outcome would test whether lawmakers of both parties, often unable to perform basic tasks like funding the government, can find a way to restore a sense of elemental competence to Washington. Mr. McConnell has long articulated his belief that a divided government can spur politically risky deals that neither party would attempt alone. He noted last week that Ronald Reagan and Speaker Tip O\u2019Neill, Democrat of Massachusetts, struck major accords on Social Security and taxes in the 1980s, and that President Bill Clinton and congressional Republicans overhauled welfare and balanced the budget in the 1990s. \u201cDivided government is actually the best government,\u201d Mr. McConnell said, \u201cthe best time to tackle really difficult things, because it requires both sides to buy into it to make progress.\u201d So why have the last six years of extremely divided government been one long series of legislative stalemates, shutdown showdowns and budget failures? Mr. McConnell blames President Obama, seen by many Republicans as a neophyte in dealing with Capitol Hill. \u201cMy greatest disappointment with President Obama is that we had numerous discussions on all of those issues,\u201d Mr. McConnell said, referring to the need for changes in entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare. \u201cAnd he was not willing to move to the political center, which obviously would have been necessary since he hasn\u2019t had control of Congress for six years, in order to achieve that.\u201d Democrats, unsurprisingly, strongly disagree. After Mr. McConnell\u2019s recent comments, the office of Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, his Democratic adversary, released data showing that Mr. Reid had been notably more productive in terms of legislation and confirmations in two years as majority leader with President George W. Bush than Mr. McConnell had been with Mr. Obama, whom Mr. McConnell famously said he wanted to make a one-term president. \u201cHistory will look back and note that Republicans in Congress treated President Obama with unprecedented disrespect,\u201d Mr. Reid said last week. \u201cNo one expected them to agree with everything that he did or tried to do, but Americans deserve better than the way Republicans behaved toward President Obama.\u201d House Republicans also share culpability in the failures of the most recent period of divided government. When John A. Boehner was speaker, he repeatedly tried to play the role that O\u2019Neill had and cut a grand bargain with the president of the opposing party. He was held back by threats to his leadership within his own party and an uncertainty among Democrats about whether he could deliver the votes. The price he paid was being driven from office by hard-right conservatives who were outraged at his willingness to compromise. Mr. Ryan, who has experienced some of the same difficulties with his party\u2019s right wing while managing to contain the dissension, is ready for an all-Republican government. \u201cI\u2019m tired of divided government\u201d Mr. Ryan said at a Washington forum sponsored by The Atlantic. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work very well.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re just at loggerheads,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten some good things done. But the big things \u2014 poverty, the debt crisis, the economy, health care \u2014 these things are stuck in divided government, and that\u2019s why we think a unified Republican government\u2019s the way to go.\u201d That view is in line with the perspective of someone who has been shaped by the House, where the majority has a strong hand and can force through legislation with little concern for the minority party\u2019s view. There have been recent examples of the setup Mr. Ryan would prefer. In the first two years of Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency, Democrats held a filibuster-proof 60 votes in the Senate and a sizable majority in the House. Together, they did produce a flood of legislation, including the health care law, Wall Street regulation and the economic stimulus. Still, the enactment of those major initiatives along mainly partisan lines fed a fierce sense of retribution, a factor that eventually cost Democrats control of Congress and contributed to an increasingly poisonous political atmosphere. Many on Capitol Hill believe Mrs. Clinton has both the experience and love of the policy process that would allow her to forge a working relationship with congressional Republicans. Some lawmakers also think that perhaps the least plausible election outcome \u2014 a Trump presidency and a Democratic Senate \u2014 could produce some legislative gains. Whatever the new configuration of government, the incoming president and members of Congress will face real pressure to deliver from a public increasingly fed up with stasis in Washington.",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump on Thursday sharply amplified his criticism of the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, raising the possibility that Mr. McConnell should relinquish his position if he cannot deliver on top legislative priorities. After venting for days, on Twitter and in private, over the Senate\u2019s failure to pass a health care repeal bill before the August recess, Mr. Trump was asked if Mr. McConnell should consider stepping down. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what,\u201d Mr. Trump began, speaking to reporters outside his golf club in Bedminster, N.J., \u201cif he doesn\u2019t get repeal and replace done and if he doesn\u2019t get taxes done, meaning cuts and reform, and if he doesn\u2019t get a very easy one to get done, infrastructure \u2014 if he doesn\u2019t get them done, then you can ask me that question.\u201d Asked whether that answer amounted to a yes or a no, Mr. Trump replied: \u201cThat means ask me that question. Let\u2019s hope he gets it done.\u201d The comments were a remarkable acceleration of tensions between a president aggrieved at his lack of significant legislative accomplishments and a lawmaker in charge of shepherding his agenda through a Republican-led Congress. They also signaled a conspicuous desire from Mr. Trump, who often campaigned as a renegade outsider with few meaningful allegiances to either party, to position himself once more as a crusader against Washington gridlock \u2014 even though he and his allies are now at the controls, grinding the gears. Some Trump advisers see value in creating distance from a Congress with dismal poll numbers, despite the Republican majorities. Yet while the confrontation seemed destined to hearten some conservative news media figures, like Sean Hannity, who have flamed Mr. McConnell since the failed health care vote, it is unlikely to improve the faltering shotgun marriage between Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans. \u201cIt\u2019s a team problem; the president has to own a piece of this,\u201d said Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker and an informal adviser to Mr. Trump. \u201cI may not be clever enough to understand this, but I don\u2019t see how a Republican president deepening his fight with the Republican majority leader gets him very far.\u201d Though Mr. Trump has far outstripped Mr. McConnell in public fury, it was the senator who initiated the flare-up this week. Speaking on Monday at a Rotary Club event in Kentucky, he said Mr. Trump had harbored \u201cexcessive expectations\u201d about the pace of progress at the Capitol. The remarks, though hardly scorching, registered as a pointed message from the laconic Senate leader, who has strained all year to wrangle his narrow majority. Mr. McConnell has gotten little help from an often disengaged and policy-averse president whose habit of setting arbitrary (and often shifting) deadlines has frustrated senators for months. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump grew animated in a phone call with Mr. McConnell, expressing disappointment in the \u201cexcessive expectations\u201d message and the repeal stumble. On Thursday, Mr. McConnell\u2019s team showed little appetite for a protracted feud. \u201cAs we\u2019ve said, the leader has repeatedly spoken about the path forward on repealing and replacing Obamacare \u2014 on the Senate floor, at media availabilities and in Kentucky,\u201d said Antonia Ferrier, Mr. McConnell\u2019s spokeswoman, in an email, using language nearly identical to a statement issued the day before. \u201cBut if he has any new statements today, I\u2019ll be sure to send them along.\u201d For Mr. McConnell \u2014 who helped engineer perhaps Mr. Trump\u2019s most meaningful feat to date, the elevation of Justice Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court \u2014 the episode follows a health care defeat that has tested the unity of his conference. After a seven-year push to unravel President Barack Obama\u2019s signature domestic achievement, Republican senators saw three of their own doom the effort last month in a dramatic early-morning vote: Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and John McCain of Arizona. Other Republicans, returning to their home states this month with little to boast about, have seethed at the outcome, exposing persistent divisions and, occasionally, peculiar justifications. Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin suggested this week that Mr. McCain\u2019s choice may have been affected by his brain tumor. Still, there is little doubt that Mr. McConnell retains a firm hold on his power. Several Republican senators emphasized their support on Thursday, while taking care not to scold Mr. Trump explicitly. \u201cI have every confidence in Leader McConnell, as does the rest of the conference,\u201d said Senator John Barrasso, Republican of Wyoming and a member of Mr. McConnell\u2019s leadership team. \u201cHis leadership remains indispensable for unity and legislative success this fall.\u201d In a statement posted on Twitter, Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the longest-serving Republican in the chamber, said Mr. McConnell \u201chas been the best leader we\u2019ve had in my time in the Senate, through very tough challenges.\u201d Others, like Senator Richard M. Burr of North Carolina and Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, also reiterated their faith in Mr. McConnell. Even some Trump allies have questioned the wisdom of antagonizing his ostensible partners in conservative policy making. \u201cAll you do is get a lot more senators irritated,\u201d Mr. Gingrich said, arguing that Mr. McConnell \u201cprobably does about as good a job as he can\u201d under the circumstances. \u201cI don\u2019t see an endgame to this.\u201d Mr. Trump himself has occasionally sounded notes of harmony this week. With a coming special election primary in Alabama, the president endorsed Mr. McConnell\u2019s preferred choice, Senator Luther Strange, in a Twitter message on Tuesday evening. But as his frustrations boiled from his New Jersey golf club during his 17-day working vacation, the president increasingly trained his fire on Mr. McConnell. \u201cCan you believe that Mitch McConnell, who has screamed Repeal & Replace for 7 years, couldn\u2019t get it done,\u201d he tweeted on Thursday morning. \u201cMust Repeal & Replace ObamaCare!\u201d Questioned by reporters on Thursday about their relationship, Mr. Trump repeatedly wondered aloud why Republicans in Congress had not done their part. \u201cAll I hear is \u2018repeal and replace,\u2019\u201d Mr. Trump said of Republicans before he took office. \u201cAnd then I get there, and I said, \u2018Where\u2019s the bill? I want to sign it,\u2019 first day. And they don\u2019t have it.\u201d Mr. Trump added that it was \u201ca disgrace\u201d that the repeal measure failed by a single vote. \u201cFrankly, it shouldn\u2019t have happened,\u201d he said. \u201cThat, I can tell you \u2014 it shouldn\u2019t have happened.\u201d McConnell allies have argued that the White House was a less-than-helpful resource in persuading two of the three senators who opposed the bill. As Ms. Murkowski held out, Mr. Trump directed his interior secretary, Ryan Zinke, to remind the senator of issues affecting her state that are controlled by the Interior Department, according to people familiar with the conversation. And Mr. McCain has long been deeply skeptical of Mr. Trump, who suggested during the campaign that the senator was not a war hero because he was captured in combat. Holding forth on Thursday, Mr. Trump did allow for the possibility that he could change his mind about Mr. McConnell, saying he would be \u201cvery happy with him\u201d if legislation starts churning. The president was asked if he had considered recruiting Mr. McConnell\u2019s wife, Elaine Chao, the transportation secretary, to help bridge the divide. He could not resist a contrast. \u201cShe\u2019s doing a very, very good job,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI\u2019m very disappointed in Mitch.\u201d",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Senator Mitch McConnell\u2019s strategy to maintain the Republican majority has been clear: trying to prove that his party can govern. But by saying he will block a Supreme Court nominee who has not even been named, Mr. McConnell is headed toward partisan warfare instead. The death of Justice Antonin Scalia has energized a right flank that has been long suspicious of Mr. McConnell and forced him into a fight that is likely to derail his smooth-functioning Senate. The tactic could alienate moderate voters and imperil incumbent Republicans in swing states, but in the supercharged partisanship of a Supreme Court fight, he probably had no choice. By framing his decision as deferring to voters in the next election, people close to him say he has minimized the political risk. \u201cIt was necessary,\u201d said Josh Holmes, Mr. McConnell\u2019s former chief of staff, who now works as a Republican consultant. \u201cThe suggestion that the American people should have a say here isn\u2019t exactly risky ground to be treading. \u201cAs for the politics,\u201d he continued, \u201cif anyone thinks the center of the electorate is clamoring for Obama to name another left-wing jurist they\u2019re nuts. The liberal left will be as loud as they ever have been, but the reality is that the consternation will be confined to the activist left.\u201d Mr. McConnell\u2019s other calculation is that if Democrats maintain the White House and take back the Senate, he will at least have denied President Obama a closing victory on the court. If Republicans take over, any heat he will take in the next year for the highly unusual move of blocking a nominee will have been worth it. He has spent his leadership of the slender Republican majority balancing the demands of conservatives, who view Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency as an eight-year constitutional crisis, and his obligations to vulnerable Republicans up for re-election this year. He has chosen the conservatives. But events in the coming months could confound that decision. Mr. Obama\u2019s nominee will put a face on what Democrats will call a clear case of obstruction, giving them someone to rally around. And a divided court must render decisions on abortion-clinic access, affirmative action at universities and Mr. Obama\u2019s executive actions on immigration. Every deadlocked 4-to-4 decision will spotlight the Senate\u2019s inaction, amplifying Democrats\u2019 cries of irresponsibility but also highlighting the stakes for conservatives set against enabling a left-leaning court majority. Mr. McConnell\u2019s strategic affront \u2014 announcing just hours after Justice Scalia\u2019s death that he would refuse to even consider a replacement \u2014 was presaged by other Republican moves over the last two years. A week ago, the Republican chairmen of the House and Senate Budget Committees said the president\u2019s budget director should not be allowed to testify at their budget hearings, a move without modern precedent. Last year, Senate Republicans dragged out the confirmation of Attorney General Loretta Lynch for more than 150 days. At the heart of nearly every major policy battle between the White House and congressional Republicans has been the contention by conservatives that Mr. Obama does not respect the Constitution, almost ensuring advance contempt for any nomination he would make. \u201cThere has been a lot of contention between Republicans and the president on a number of constitutional issues,\u201d Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah and a member of the Judiciary Committee, said in an interview on Sunday. \u201cI think it was really helpful that Senator McConnell came out and staked out that position when he did. I think he has accurately expressed how the Republican conference feels.\u201d Mr. McConnell, who has spent most of his career steering away from ideological positions, has been known to take fast turns to the right in early stages of a public debate, such as when he endorsed Senator Rand Paul, his fellow Kentuckian, for president in the incipient stages of his now-suspended campaign. He has also tended to tilt right in debates on the Senate floor on policy issues. In a twist, the greatest beneficiary of Mr. McConnell\u2019s strategy may be the Republican White House candidate he and his Senate Republicans like the least \u2014 Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, a former Supreme Court clerk whose quick and stalwart opposition to any confirmation is certain to resonate with the most tuned-in Republican primary voters. Mr. Cruz said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d on Sunday that he would filibuster any nominee Mr. Obama might offer. \u201cThis next election needs to be a referendum on the court,\u201d he said. At the same time, Mr. McConnell\u2019s move makes for uncomfortable times for someone like Senator Kelly Ayotte, Republican of New Hampshire, who has a very late primary in a swing state and on Sunday released a statement that said she supported Mr. McConnell\u2019s decision. Endorsing Mr. McConnell\u2019s strategy could hurt her in the general election , especially if 4-to-4 decisions on the Supreme Court start piling up. Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, who is also up for re-election, issued a statement of condolence to Justice Scalia\u2019s family without mentioning the ensuing confirmation fight already engulfing Washington. Democrats were quick to criticize Mr. McConnell\u2019s decision. \u201cMcConnell\u2019s precipitous action is reminiscent of his statement in 2010 that his prime goal was to prevent Mr. Obama\u2019s re-election,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York. \u201cObama hadn\u2019t presented his proposals for the upcoming Congress; now he hasn\u2019t named a nominee for the court. He realizes it\u2019s better for his senators up for re-election to show he is working in a bipartisan way, but any efforts in that direction have been undone by that action.\u201d Mr. Schumer and other Democrats note that two of the justices on court \u2014 Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas \u2014 were nominated by Republican presidents and confirmed when Democrats held the majority in the Senate. But these are more polarized times, against the backdrop of an unusual presidential race. \u201cThis is not something that is in debate,\u201d Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who is seeking the Democratic nomination, said on \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on CBS. \u201cThe Constitution of the United States of America provides that the president appoints, nominates a Supreme Court justice. And then the Senate holds hearings and deliberation and votes on whether or not to approve that nomination.\u201d",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Although there is plenty of anxiety in Washington about the shaky early performance of the Trump administration, don\u2019t count Senator Mitch McConnell among the hand wringers. Mr. McConnell, a Kentucky Republican and the majority leader, says he and his Senate Republican colleagues are quite satisfied with the Trump team so far. In fact, he said, they are reassured by signs that President Trump is going to hew to a conservative agenda after early fears that the president \u2014 a relatively unknown quantity to most elected Republicans \u2014 might not really be one of them. \u201cThe country doesn\u2019t need saving,\u201d Mr. McConnell said when asked during an interview in his Capitol office if there was any cause for a senior-level congressional intervention given early chaos in the evolving West Wing. \u201cI think there is a high level of satisfaction with the new administration,\u201d he said, dismissing concerns about dissonant eruptions from the new president and some of his top staff members. \u201cOur members are not obsessed with the daily tweets, but are looking at the results.\u201d He added: \u201cNo matter what sort of theatrics that go on around the administration, if you look at the decisions that are being made, they are solid \u2014 from our perspective \u2014 right-of-center things that we would have hoped a new Republican president would have done.\u201d Mr. McConnell has broken with the president on a few subjects, taking a much harder line against President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia than Mr. Trump has and objecting to some of the president\u2019s \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d initiatives, including a proposal for congressional term limits. Other members of the Republican establishment \u2014 inside and outside Congress \u2014 have expressed growing alarm about the conduct and competence of the White House. But Mr. McConnell, whose wife, Elaine Chao, was named by Mr. Trump as secretary of transportation, said things might even be turning out better than anticipated. \u201cBack during the campaign, there were a lot of questions: Is Trump really a conservative? A lot of questions about it,\u201d Mr. McConnell recalled. \u201cBut if you look at the steps that have been taken so far, looks good to me. \u201cIt is the kind of thing we would have expected of one of the others, had they been nominated and elected,\u201d Mr. McConnell said, referring to Republican presidential candidates defeated by Mr. Trump who had more conventional political and government backgrounds. Mr. McConnell\u2019s view clashes violently with that of Senate Democrats and their allies around the country. They have viewed the beginning of the Trump era as a disaster best exemplified by an immigration executive order they decry as unconstitutional and un-American, as well as a selection of cabinet choices they rate as unqualified and carrying the very same baggage that has prevented others from being confirmed in the past. Even some Republicans have criticized as inept and amateurish the rollout of the immigration order, which is now at the center of a federal court fight. Others have expressed trepidation at the prospect of being hammered in a Trump tweet if they run afoul of the new president. Mr. McConnell, who is known for being able to take the temperature of his colleagues and to act accordingly, said he sensed no real unease about Mr. Trump on the Republican side of the aisle. \u201cWe have had very good unity on our side,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201cPeople are genuinely excited about taking the country in another direction. I don\u2019t find any decision that he has made surprising.\u201d He said Senate Republicans had been enthusiastic about Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet nominees, dazzled by his Supreme Court pick and elated at the chance to roll back what he called the regulatory rampage of the Obama administration. \u201cA lot of us were wondering, what is Trump really going to be like?\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201cHe used to support Democrats and have various views earlier in his life about politics. But when he got to the point of actually having the office and making the decisions, I think the decisions have been very comforting to my members, most of whom are a little bit right of center and further right of center.\u201d It goes without saying that having Mr. Trump in the White House gives House and Senate Republicans the opportunity to pursue an aggressive legislative agenda if they can find common ground. That prospect should be heightened by installing colleagues like Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama and two fellow Republicans, Representatives Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina and Tom Price of Georgia, at the highest levels of the administration. Mr. Sessions is Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee for attorney general while Mr. Mulvaney has been tapped to run the White House Office of Management and Budget and Mr. Price to head the Department of Health and Human Services. Mr. McConnell looms as potentially the president\u2019s most important ally in Congress because success in the Senate is central to any legislative victory. But Republicans have not even started on the legislative end of the new Congress. Now their job is going to be made more difficult by the increasingly hard line that Democrats are taking against Mr. Trump by opposing his cabinet nominees en masse. Mr. McConnell\u2019s frustration at Democratic tactics boiled over Tuesday evening when he invoked a rarely used Senate rule to force Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, to end a speech on the grounds she was impugning the integrity of Mr. Sessions, a fellow senator, by criticizing his record on civil rights. \u201cIt is a superficially poisonous atmosphere, not a fundamentally poisonous atmosphere,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. Still, he noted that Republicans could do much of their preliminary work in the Senate just by relying on their party\u2019s 51 votes there as they take up health care, tax changes and nominations, and could try to work out the differences with Democrats later. \u201cSooner or later we will get around to things that will require some level of cooperation,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201cHopefully there will be a kind of dysfunction fatigue. I think it will set in way before then.\u201d His point raises a question: Will that same passage of time produce a kind of Trump fatigue among the now-satisfied congressional Republicans?",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 When he became majority leader, propelled by sweeping Republican victories last year, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky vowed to run a more productive and traditional Senate than his Democratic predecessor, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada. In some ways, that has come to pass. Democrats have been given greater opportunity to amend bills than Republicans had when Mr. Reid led the majority. Mr. McConnell promised there would be no government shutdown, and he averted one over funding the Department of Homeland Security. And, occasionally, senators now have to work on Fridays. But when it comes to the central role of a Senate leader \u2014 getting things done \u2014 Mr. McConnell has been impeded by internal struggles in his party and the hostility that awaits him across the aisle. The latest mess \u2014 a stalled sex-trafficking bill and Mr. McConnell\u2019s related refusal to bring a confirmation vote for President Obama\u2019s nominee for attorney general \u2014 follows the rancorous struggle over the bill to fund Homeland Security that Republicans tried to use to undo Mr. Obama\u2019s immigration policy. A promise to let committees do their work was momentarily reversed when Mr. McConnell said he would speed bills concerning sanctions against Iran to the floor instead of waiting for the Foreign Relations Committee. Then he backed off, inciting anger and confusion. Republicans say that Mr. McConnell is doing his best to change the glacial ways of the Senate, and point out that bipartisan bills, including one on cybersecurity, will soon come to the floor. \u201cThe corrosion of the Senate took place over many years,\u201d Mr. McConnell said in an email. \u201cSo restoring the institution to allow members of both parties and their constituents to have a voice in the legislative process will take longer than three months. But we\u2019re making progress.\u201d Many of the troubles stem from Mr. McConnell\u2019s poisonous relationship with Mr. Reid, born of their many fights on policy and procedure. The two trade barbs on the Senate floor and beyond almost daily, and have dug in deeply on the trafficking bill, which had been relatively noncontroversial. Instead of seasoned senators guiding policy, the two often seem more like aging uncles fighting at the family dinner table over who put too much garlic in the potatoes while the rest of the guests sit sullenly waiting to eat. \u201cLeaders have to have a relationship,\u201d said Senator Joe Manchin III, a moderate Democrat from West Virginia. \u201cThey have to be able to communicate. I haven\u2019t seen that between Harry and Mitch, and we have seen the outcome of that and it\u2019s not working.\u201d The battle of wills may foreshadow new nastiness over the coming months as Congress turns to writing a budget, fixing the Medicare payment formula for doctors and shoring up the nation\u2019s highway system. The emerging bipartisan House solution to the Medicare payment system is already being quietly opposed by Mr. Reid. Unlike Speaker John A. Boehner\u2019s power in the House, which had seemingly been limited to thwarting Mr. Obama\u2019s agenda while Democrats controlled the Senate, Mr. McConnell\u2019s newly won status came with a charge to alter his party\u2019s image from obstructionists to policy architects in service to its candidate for the White House. Outside of the Senate, some conservatives lament that they have yet to see evidence of new ideas surfacing in legislation. \u201cYou don\u2019t look at this majority and say that is a Congress full of bold and interesting ideas,\u2019\u201d said William Kristol, editor of The Weekly Standard. \u201cIt would be nice to have a party that is not just tactically smart in the halls of Congress but could help frame a national message. And I don\u2019t think that is McConnell\u2019s strength.\u201d At the same time, Mr. McConnell was expected to be better at working out bipartisan legislation than Mr. Boehner or Mr. Reid. For instance, he quietly helped put together a deal in 2010 to extend the Bush-era tax cuts and end a budget stalemate that hobbled the government for months. But Mr. Reid has now mirrored Mr. McConnell\u2019s own tactics as minority leader, holding together his troops and filibustering most bills that come to the floor. \u201cI think it\u2019s pretty obvious the rules of the Senate can impede things from happening,\u201d said Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona. Mr. Reid is also discouraging the amendment process, as he did when he was in the majority. \u201cHarry Reid hasn\u2019t changed, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d said John Cornyn, Republican of Texas. \u201cHe led his caucus over the cliff and lost nine Senate seats, and what\u2019s to me the most amazing thing is they apparently didn\u2019t learn any lessons from that experience.\u201d Adam Jentleson, a spokesman for Mr. Reid, disagreed. \u201cEven in the majority their instincts are still to obstruct, pick unnecessary fights and reflexively oppose anything President Obama supports,\u201d he said Yet for Mr. McConnell, some errors seem unforced. Republicans added an abortion restriction to an otherwise bipartisan sex-trafficking bill, making it untenable for Democrats. Although there is controversy over whether Democrats knew about the language all along, Republicans would not take it out. \u201cIt\u2019s a bad idea to put poison pills in your own bills,\u201d said Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri. \u201cI think it\u2019s more stumbling on their side than strategy on ours.\u201d While Democrats look to have bumbled, admitting they missed the abortion language when they read the bill, Republicans opened themselves to criticism over the decision to hold up the nomination of Loretta E. Lynch, who would be the first black female attorney general. On Thursday, the Senate had a third failed vote on the bill. Members of both parties, including Senators Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, and Heidi Heitkamp, Democrat of North Dakota \u2014 both moderates with a longstanding interest in the sex-trafficking problem \u2014 labored to come to a compromise, but the Senate seemed far from a solution. On Ms. Lynch, Mr. McConnell finds himself constrained \u2014 most Republicans have said they would not vote to confirm her no matter when her nomination comes to the floor, making it likely that Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. will have to cast a tiebreaking vote. That is not precisely the image of a new and functioning Congress. \u201cWhen you have a shift, it takes a while to get moving,\u201d said Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee. \u201cWe\u2019ve had our obstacles.\u201d",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Senator Ted Cruz, the sometimes-incendiary Texan running for the Republican presidential nomination, took to the Senate floor on Friday to call his party\u2019s majority leader a liar in an extraordinary public airing of grievance. Mr. Cruz, an ardent opponent of the federal Export-Import Bank, reacted in starkly personal terms after the leader, Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, allowed a vote pressed by a bipartisan group of senators to resurrect the government\u2019s export credit agency. That vote will come Sunday in a rare weekend session of Congress called to rush forward a major infrastructure bill before the Highway Trust Fund runs out of money July 31. \u201cI cannot believe he would tell a flat-out lie,\u201d Mr. Cruz said of Mr. McConnell, who he said had promised him there was no deal to bring the Export-Import Bank matter up for a vote. Mr. Cruz said allowing that vote on the measure, which will almost certainly pass, was \u201can absolute demonstration that not only what he told every Republican senator, but what he told the press over and over and over again, was a simple lie.\u201d The outburst breached the Senate\u2019s decorum \u2014 and perhaps its rules, which preclude a senator from using \u201cany form of words\u201d to \u201cimpute to another senator or to other senators any conduct or motive unworthy or unbecoming a senator.\u201d Mr. McConnell and his staff declined to comment. Aides to Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the Senate\u2019s No. 2 Republican, said he also would not comment on Mr. Cruz\u2019s speech. Mr. Cruz has been a combative figure since his arrival in the Senate in 2013, when he helped shut down the government in a fruitless effort to defund the Affordable Care Act. He also pressed to shut down the Department of Homeland Security this year over President Obama\u2019s executive orders on immigration. While Mr. Cruz frequently challenges Democrats, he has largely refrained from attacking fellow Republicans. \u201cIn my time in the Senate, I haven\u2019t impugned the character of Republicans or Democrats, and I don\u2019t intend to start today,\u201d he said this month when pressed to condemn a fellow Republican White House hopeful, Donald J. Trump, who had questioned Senator John McCain\u2019s wartime heroism. On Friday, Mr. Cruz held nothing back. He detailed what he said was a closed-door confrontation he had with Mr. McConnell in May, after supporters of the Export-Import Bank tried to derail a trade bill unless they were promised a vote to keep the bank open. \u201cIt was a direct question I asked the majority leader in front of all the Republican senators,\u201d he said. He said that Mr. McConnell had been \u201cvisibly angry\u201d and that \u201clike St. Peter,\u201d the majority leader had offered a denial three times: \u201cThere is no deal, there is no deal, there is no deal.\u201d Far from backing down, Mr. Cruz joined the conservative radio show host Rush Limbaugh on Friday afternoon, basking in Mr. Limbaugh\u2019s praise for a \u201cdirect hit\u201d on leadership like none he could remember. \u201cIt\u2019s not a good day when the majority leader is willing to lie to the Senate,\u201d Mr. Cruz told Mr. Limbaugh. Tea Party groups, the Heritage Foundation\u2019s political arm, and Charles G. and David H. Koch\u2019s Freedom Partners rushed to Mr. Cruz\u2019s defense. Support for the Export-Import Bank in both the House and Senate is sufficient to restore it if Republican leaders allow a vote. On June 30, the authorization ran out on the agency, which offers loan guarantees and other assistance to the foreign customers of American exporters. Businesses  \u2014 powered by some of the nation\u2019s biggest corporations, like Boeing, General Electric and Caterpillar \u2014 have been pressing to reopen it, arguing that the conservative war on the agency is costing American jobs in the service of a purely ideological fight. On the other side of the money fight, Delta Air Lines, the Kochs, Club for Growth and the Heritage Foundation are fueling the opposition. Mr. Cruz framed the fight as one pitting \u201cthe Washington cartel of the lobbyists on K Street, or the big money and big corporations,\u201d against the American taxpayer. Money has in fact sloshed through both sides of the fight. Among Republican presidential candidates, only Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, where Boeing operations benefit from Export-Import Bank financing, supports restoring the agency. Mr. McConnell, in allowing a vote Sunday afternoon to reopen the bank, was careful to say he personally opposed it. At the same time, he offered conservatives a compromise in the form of a separate amendment to the highway bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Mr. Cruz called that \u201can empty show vote.\u201d \u201cThe Republican leader is behaving like the senior senator from Nevada,\u201d Mr. Cruz said, accusing Mr. McConnell of running the Senate the same way his predecessor, Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, operated. In a test vote last month, 65 senators, Republican and Democrat, showed that they would vote for the Export-Import Bank\u2019s reauthorization. In the House, 60 Republicans have signed on to legislation to reopen new lending activity at the bank, more than enough to pass a bill that has overwhelming Democratic support. The question is whether Speaker John A. Boehner will buck the opposition of other Republicans on his leadership team to allow the Senate\u2019s bank amendment to come to a vote.",

      "content": " LOUISVILLE, Ky. \u2014 Mitch McConnell, the taciturn leader of the Senate Republicans who overcame childhood polio and decades of political conflagrations to become the longest-serving senator in Kentucky\u2019s history, cruised to re-election Tuesday.  With his party winning control of the Senate on the same night, he fulfilled his decades-long dream of becoming majority leader. In capturing a sixth term, Mr. McConnell turned back Alison Lundergan Grimes, the Democrat whose campaign as the anti-obstructionist, fueled by the intense passion and giant cash infusions from her party, failed to ever really catch fire. Ninety minutes after the polls closed, Mr. McConnell thanked supporters at a Marriott in Louisville. \u201cI work hard to bring your concerns to Washington, and I will not let up,\u201d he said. Ms. Grimes, he said, \u201cran a spirited campaign. She earned a lot of votes, and she earned my respect.\u201d Referring to the congressional gridlock that has appalled many Americans and turned them against Washington, Mr. McConnell said, \u201cJust because we have a two-party system doesn\u2019t mean we have to be in perpetual conflict.\u201d Senator Rand Paul was at the victory party to congratulate Mr. McConnell. \u201cTonight, Kentucky makes it perfectly clear: Mr. President, the war on Kentucky coal must end,\u201d Mr. Paul said. Although Mr. McConnell\u2019s victory seemed all but assured in recent days, he began his campaign last year as one of the most endangered incumbents, entering the race with an approval rating in the state even worse than President Obama\u2019s. Conservative Republicans, suspicious of Mr. McConnell\u2019s long tenure and willingness to work quietly with Democrats, put the senator in their cross hairs and went searching for a primary challenger. Their pick was Matt Bevin, a businessman whose snappy language and toothpaste-commercial smile helped draw large crowds and early excitement within the state\u2019s Republican base. But Mr. McConnell, 72, lived up to his reputation as a seasoned, often brutal campaigner, and he easily won the Republican primary in May. To inoculate himself from the Tea Party attacks, he hired senior campaign staff members from Mr. Paul. Mr. McConnell had been Mr. Paul\u2019s nemesis, but once his re-election campaign began, he quickly changed course and began supporting the junior senator by voting for his bills and giving him good assignments in the Senate. In Mr. McConnell, Democrats saw a different sort of prey, trying to depict him as the face of Republican obstruction in Washington. Democrats were initially animated by the prospect of pitting him against a female candidate at a time when Republicans were being criticized for their treatment of women. But Ms. Grimes also proved her own worst enemy at times, especially when she refused to say whether or not she had voted for Mr. Obama in a state where the president is deeply unpopular. Further, few candidates know every political nook and cranny of their state like Mr. McConnell. \u201cHe has taken it very seriously,\u201d said Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, a vice chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. \u201cHe has really been involved and engaged with Kentucky politics inside and out, and he is extremely knowledgeable about the state.\u201d No matter the exact balance of the Senate, Mr. McConnell will have to manage difficult political crosscurrents in his conference. No fewer than three Republican senators who have their eye on the White House will be inclined to pull their colleagues to the right to appeal to the conservative voters who form the party\u2019s base. At the same time, more than a half-dozen Republicans will be up for election in blue or purple states, and will be inclined to cling to the center. Mr. McConnell graduated with honors from the University of Louisville, where he served as student body president. As a student leader, he marched for civil rights in 1964 and often took positions early in his political career that were pro-union, at a time when unions had more clout in Kentucky. He worked as both an aide on Capitol Hill and as deputy assistant attorney general to President Gerald R. Ford, before his election to the Senate in 1984. He was the only Republican challenger that year to defeat a Democratic incumbent. He was among the first Senate candidates to clinch victory on Tuesday night, hours ahead of results that gave the Republicans control. But as he stood before cheering supporters here, he alluded to his anticipation of a new Republican majority and himself as its leader.",

      "content": " Fresh from his own re-election victory and his party\u2019s powerful showing nationwide, Senator Mitch McConnell on Wednesday pledged to break the stalemate in Washington as newly empowered congressional Republicans moved quickly to demonstrate that they can get things done. \u201cWe\u2019re going to pass legislation,\u201d Mr. McConnell said at a news conference in Louisville, Ky. \u201cThis gridlock and dysfunction can be ended.\u201d Despite their new majority in the Senate and an expanded one in the House, Republicans face multiple difficulties, not the least of which are internal divisions. But they say they know they have to deliver or face a backlash in 2016. \u201cI think it really becomes important to appear to want to be a governing party rather than a complaining party,\u201d said Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri, a member of the party leadership. \u201cMy belief is we have about six months before the American people check that box one way or the other.\u201d Anticipating for months that they would take the Senate and pad their majority in the House, Republicans have been quietly discussing their agenda and approach after regularly accusing Democrats, led by Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, of thwarting their priorities. They say they will focus on balancing the budget, restoring an orderly process for spending bills, revising if not repealing the health care law and enacting a major overhaul of the tax code \u2014 ambitious goals, given years of stalemate and discord. Before taking up the issue of immigration, Republicans are likely to see what unilateral action President Obama undertakes, and how the country reacts to it. Senate Republicans also intend to use their control of committees to bring new scrutiny to the White House, federal agencies and Mr. Obama\u2019s expanding use of executive authority. Mr. McConnell, who will succeed Mr. Reid as majority leader when the new Congress convenes in January, has also promised wholesale changes in the way the Senate operates, including a five-day workweek, more floor debate and empowered committee chairmen. Republicans say they intend to force Mr. Obama to make choices on bills passed by the House that Senate Democrats have been able to keep from his desk, potentially touching off the president\u2019s first extensive use of the veto after six years in office. Some Democrats who have been frustrated by the stalemate in the Senate say they are open to cooperating with Republicans. \u201cRight now, we are helping destroy each other,\u201d said Senator Joe Manchin III, a centrist Democrat from West Virginia. \u201cI would like to think we can work together. I\u2019d like to get my amendments in debate.\u201d In gaining control of the Senate, however, Republicans ousted some of the red-state Democrats most inclined to work with them, such as Senator Mark Pryor of Arkansas, reducing the number of potential Democratic allies. Other tensions may complicate their efforts. Mr. McConnell, with few votes to spare, will have to balance the views of a handful of more moderate Republicans, such as Senator Susan Collins of Maine, with those of unyielding conservatives such as Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who following the election said Republicans should press their advantage as hard as possible. Mr. McConnell will also have to contend with the competing interests of Mr. Cruz and at least two other Republican senators expected to run for president \u2014 Rand Paul of Kentucky and Marco Rubio of Florida \u2014 and those of senators up for re-election in 2016 in swing states like Illinois, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. As for legislation, the party\u2019s leaders in Congress are eying five major priorities: ENERGY  Approving the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada could be fertile ground for agreement with Democrats who have differed with the White House on the issue. Combining the pipeline with new energy exports, expanded exploration and added efficiency could result in a bipartisan consensus on energy policy. On a conference call last week, Speaker John A. Boehner assured his members that he was \u201cprepared to move quickly, along with Mitch McConnell, to make clear that the new Congress will be about jobs and the economy,\u201d according to an official familiar with the speaker\u2019s remarks. \u201cI\u2019m talking about bills to green-light construction of the Keystone pipeline and increase exports of American-made liquefied natural gas; to restore the 40-hour workweek for American workers that was undone by Obamacare; to encourage American employers to hire more of our veterans,\u201d Mr. Boehner said, according to the official. BUDGET AND SPENDING Republican leaders in both the House and Senate say that reaching a deal on a budget will be crucial not only to prove that they can do it, but also to allow conservatives to put their imprint on a nonbinding fiscal plan. Senator Jeff Sessions, the conservative Alabama Republican who will lead the Budget Committee, has had his staff looking at federal spending for months to find places to cut in hopes of proposing a budget that would be balanced in as little as a decade. But despite wide sentiment among Republicans for cuts, a divide exists within the party. Some Republicans would like to reverse a series of Pentagon spending constraints put in place through earlier budget deals with Democrats, arguing that the military is being strained at a time when it is being required to fight the continuing threat of Islamic terrorism in the Middle East. Mr. Sessions has expressed reservations about easing the spending limits on the Pentagon, and doing so would make balancing the budget harder and require even more to be cut from politically sensitive social programs. But reaching a budget deal is also essential to putting in place a set of procedural shortcuts that would allow Republicans to force through changes in the health care law and a tax package on a simple majority vote, avoiding the threat of a Democratic filibuster. If they can enact a budget, Republicans hope to return to reviewing what traditionally have been 12 separate annual spending bills and reinvigorating a process that has all but collapsed by putting the bills on the floor and allowing senators to amend them. In March, for the first time since Mr. Obama took office, Republicans will also have to find a way to pass an increase in the debt limit as the majority party \u2014 a difficult task given that the debt limit has become such a lightning rod for conservatives who object to any increase in federal borrowing power. Mr. McConnell suggested on Wednesday that Republicans would address the debt limit in the budget. TAXES A sweeping overhaul of the entire tax code is another top priority for the new majority, one that at least in theory has some Democratic support. And much of the spadework has already been done \u2014 at the Treasury Department, the House Ways and Means Committee, which is likely to be led by Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, and the Senate Finance Committee, which will now have Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, as its chairman. Mr. Hatch will replace Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, a Democrat who is also a tax overhaul advocate and could be instrumental in the debate. The key to a deal will be the Obama administration. Treasury officials have already developed a detailed plan to simplify the corporate tax code and lower the corporate tax rate to 28 percent from 35 percent. Republicans want it closer to 25 percent and have repeatedly said any tax overhaul must include reductions in the individual tax rates, which apply to many small businesses. It looms as a difficult negotiation, but it is possible Mr. Obama could take a page from President Ronald Reagan, who worked with Democrats to pass the 1986 Tax Reform Act. HEALTH CARE  It is a delicate topic, but top Republicans acknowledge they cannot repeal the Affordable Care Act, particularly with Mr. Obama able to veto any such effort. They will no doubt take some repeal votes, but their initial focus could be on smaller changes. For instance, a medical device tax used to pay for the law is opposed by lawmakers from both parties who represent manufacturers, and a repeal of the tax could pass Congress. And another group of Republicans and Democrats has also called for returning the health law\u2019s definition of full-time work to 40 hours from 30, arguing that the lower limit is forcing too many people out of work because of employers\u2019 efforts to comply with the law. Mr. Boehner singled out that measure as one that he would like to see advance. TRADE This is one area where the Obama administration and Republicans have a good chance of finding common ground. Republicans are enthusiastic advocates of increased trade, and the president is eager to get the added authority to negotiate new trade deals and win approval of a trade agreement with nations on the Pacific Rim. The main obstacle could be Democrats, many of whom are skeptical of trade deals that labor warns could cost American jobs. But a significant segment of Democrats back trade expansion, and a deal could probably be found if both congressional Republicans and the White House both press for it. Over all, those on both sides of the aisle agree that the change in Senate control presents a chance to curb the gridlock that has consumed Congress, but it also holds peril for Republicans if they fail to deliver. \u201cThey have a golden opportunity,\u201d Mr. Manchin, the Democratic senator from West Virginia, said. \u201cIf they get that and fail miserably, it is very bleak for them in 2016.\u201d",

      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 More than a year before a difficult election cycle when he will be challenged to hold on to his hard-won Republican majority, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky may have already suffered his most significant loss \u2014 the pending departure of Speaker John A. Boehner. Over the past six years, the two Republican leaders have developed a bond of the type that has not always existed between House and Senate leaders of the same party, figures who are often pulled in opposite directions. More important, Mr. McConnell and Mr. Boehner agreed that engaging in the kind of brinkmanship that led to a government shutdown two years ago as well as the threat of a federal default on financial obligations was unacceptable as well as damaging to the Republican Party and its electoral prospects. Now, faced with defending Republican seats in a presidential election year in such potentially difficult states as Florida, Illinois, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, Mr. McConnell is convinced that Republicans must avoid disruptions that can make them look incapable of governing. Given the legislative uncertainty in the aftermath of Mr. Boehner\u2019s retirement, Mr. McConnell is hoping for one more act with the speaker, by pushing with Mr. Boehner to resolve some pressing issues before he exits at the end of October. On Tuesday, Mr. McConnell said he and Mr. Boehner would like to begin talks with the White House on a budget agreement that would set spending levels for the next two years, through the end of President Obama\u2019s term. Spending is just one of the issues up in the air along with a need to increase the federal debt limit, an expiring highway program and the continuing push to renew the Export-Import Bank. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to deal with all of these issues between now and December the 11th,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201cHow much of that could come together before Speaker Boehner leaves, I have no earthly idea.\u201d While Mr. McConnell wants to keep things on something of an even keel through November 2016, it is uncertain how Mr. Boehner\u2019s replacement will feel. But it is very likely the incoming speaker will be compelled to go further than Mr. McConnell in challenging Mr. Obama and Congressional Democrats to satisfy the conservative forces that helped oust Mr. Boehner. \u201cSenator McConnell is going to be in an interesting position,\u201d said Dan Holler, a spokesman for Heritage Action for America, a conservative group and the political arm of the Heritage Foundation that has been critical of both Mr. Boehner and Mr. McConnell. \u201cWhoever the next speaker is going to be is more than likely to embrace a more adversarial position with the Senate.\u201d Mr. Boehner\u2019s decision to step aside will also focus more of the conservative fire on Mr. McConnell, who made it his job in 2014 to prevent primary challengers backed by Tea Party groups from knocking off incumbents or challengers backed by Senate Republicans. Citizens for the Republic, a conservative activist group that includes former Attorney General Edwin Meese III on its board, on Tuesday urged Mr. McConnell to resign. But Mr. McConnell does not face the internal dissent that Mr. Boehner has weathered for years; he is not leaving, nor do his colleagues want him to. \u201cHere, there are 54 of us, and we know each other so well and we have close personal relationships,\u201d said Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona and a man who has clashed with Mr. McConnell in the past over issues including campaign financing. \u201cThere are only a very few senators, maybe one or two here, who don\u2019t support him.\u201d One of them, Ted Cruz of Texas, is among four Republican senators running for president. Mr. Cruz has been openly critical of Mr. McConnell, and the role he and the others play as the first primaries approach will add another layer of complexity for the majority leader. Overall, though, the mind-set and culture of the Senate is also much different from the House, as evidenced in the overwhelming vote on Monday to advance a stopgap spending bill without language to end federal financing for Planned Parenthood, as demanded by House conservatives. \u201cIt\u2019s important for our party to demonstrate that we have the competence to govern,\u201d said Senator Pat Toomey, the Pennsylvania Republican who has a tough re-election fight next year. As they eyed the upheaval in the House, Senate Republicans said that Mr. Boehner\u2019s departure may serve as a catharsis and allow some consensus to be found. \u201cI think the work to do is obvious and the challenges are well known,\u201d said Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri, who has served in leadership roles in the House and Senate. \u201cI\u2019m hoping that Speaker Boehner\u2019s decision reminds everybody that when leaders aren\u2019t allowed to lead, they decide to do something else.\u201d Whatever happens, Mr. McConnell is not likely to concede too much power to the House. He will probably push the Senate to take the legislative lead to keep the government churning as he did in by stepping in front of the House to advance a measure to keep the government open. The Senate is expected to approve that legislation Wednesday and quickly send it to the House for a vote before the fiscal year ends at midnight. When Mr. Boehner found himself under siege in the past, Mr. McConnell was more than willing to act unilaterally. He has cooperated with Democrats, such as when he worked with Senator Barbara Boxer of California, to put together a bill to fund the nation\u2019s highway system. And he has repeatedly reached out to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. to hammer out fiscal compromises. Mr. McConnell declined on Tuesday to offer House Republicans any guidance on replacing Mr. Boehner, though he acknowledged his familiarity with Representative Kevin McCarthy, the California Republican and majority leader considered the favorite to become the new speaker. \u201cI do know Kevin,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a good relationship.\u201d He noted that he and his fellow Senate Republican leaders would work with \u201cwhatever team the House ultimately selects.\u201d But for Mr. McConnell, it will not be like working with John Boehner.",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Once, when Mitch McConnell was dishing privately to me on the congressional crisis of the moment, I thanked him for his candor and insight. \u201cWell,\u201d he said in his distinctive drawl, \u201cyou know I\u2019m only telling you this because it helps me.\u201d I did know. But it also helped me as a reporter. Still, even given my long experience with the canny Kentucky Republican, I was a little surprised to see this frank admission on the first page of his new memoir, \u201cThe Long Game\u201d: \u201cI only talk to the press if it\u2019s to my advantage,\u201d Mr. McConnell wrote, putting it more bluntly than most politicians, even the ones who see it the same way. Mr. McConnell wasn\u2019t always so dismissive of the press. On another occasion, he recounted to me how, as a new senator, he was envious as he watched senior colleagues being shadowed and pestered by reporters, making him yearn for the kind of stature where someone would pay him similar attention. Nowadays, Mr. McConnell will stroll purposefully past inquiring reporters without so much as a glance in their direction. The senator has a steely discipline not only when it comes to the news media, but with life itself. His book chronicles his successful struggle against polio as a child, his first neighborhood fistfight, his early obsession with politics, his embrace of civil rights and his slow but steady climb to the position he always coveted and now holds \u2014 majority leader of the United States Senate. No White House ambition for him, an attribute that separates him from many of his colleagues. The book also has a few surprises. It reveals that young Mitch McConnell favored sporty cars \u2014 a \u201clittle red Corvair,\u201d a 1961 two-seater MG and a 1966 Ford Mustang. He also discloses that he seriously considered not running for re-election in 2014, fearing his could be the defeat that would keep Republicans in the minority. A funny moment occurs when he, as the chairman of the 2001 presidential inaugural, and George W. Bush, the soon-to-be president, briefly panic over the absence of a speaker\u2019s lectern on the inaugural platform, not realizing it would rise from beneath the stage. Then there is a not-so-surprising revelation to those who have watched Mr. McConnell stubbornly refuse to budge from talking points and doggedly spend day after day on the Senate floor hitting the same rehearsed points. \u201cGood politics is repetition,\u201d he writes. Mr. McConnell recognizes that he often plays the villain in the narrative of the contemporary Senate \u2014 the charisma-challenged, die-hard foe of overhauling the campaign finance system and the king of the filibuster. He finds victories in the arcana of legislating, gloating that he was the first to realize he could thwart campaign finance legislation by blocking once-routine motions to open conference committee negotiations with the House. He sees employing such tactics as an obligation, not an obnoxious stalling maneuver. \u201cFilibustering is sometimes presented as an obstructionist tactic by its opponents, but in my view, if legislation as awful as this bill is brought up for consideration, there is a duty to obstruct its passage,\u201d he says. On the other hand, Democrats, led by Mr. McConnell\u2019s archrival, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, were \u2014 in Mr. McConnell\u2019s partisan telling \u2014 guilty of ruining the Senate when they used their numbers and procedural skills to stymie Republicans and push President Obama\u2019s agenda. \u201cIt was utterly depressing to watch what Harry Reid had done to the Senate,\u201d Mr. McConnell writes. Mr. Reid has since called Mr. McConnell classless for his criticism. Mr. McConnell\u2019s skill as a political tactician belies his low-key manner. Near the end of his book, he recounts another episode I was involved in that led to one of his more memorable political comments. One reason Republicans were not able to capture control of the Senate in 2010 and 2012 was that hard-right conservative challengers had knocked off establishment-favored candidates in party primaries only to fall to Democrats in the general election. Brought into the Republican leader\u2019s office for an interview in March 2014, I asked how he expected the party to fare against another round of threatening primary challenges, including one to his own candidacy in Kentucky. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to crush them everywhere,\u201d Mr. McConnell, not typically known for pungent sound bites, said. \u201cI don\u2019t think they are going to have a single nominee anywhere in the country.\u201d We proceeded with the interview as I mulled over the comment. I later gave his staff members a heads-up that my article would focus on his bold prediction, a cringe-worthy moment for some of them. Mr. McConnell acknowledges in his book that his staff was uncomfortable, fearing the remark would be seen as a provocative rejection of the Tea Party voters crucial to Republican prospects. \u201cRegardless of how my staff felt about it, I believed what I\u2019d said,\u201d he writes. \u201cI had no animosity toward the Tea Party, because we all wanted to achieve the same things. My problem was with the groups who hijacked their agenda for their own profit.\u201d \u201cAnd I did it,\u201d Mr. McConnell declares proudly about his success in snuffing out threats from the right and finally becoming majority leader after election wins that November. The book ends on that triumphant note, before the rise of Donald J. Trump and the threat his presidential candidacy poses to vulnerable Republican incumbents in the Senate. Mr. McConnell has endorsed Mr. Trump. But he must be concerned that the presumptive nominee\u2019s brash and unpredictable style could now crush Mr. McConnell\u2019s own chances of remaining majority leader.",

      "content": " The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, made a vigorous and urgent argument this week to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Speaking on the Senate floor Monday and Tuesday, he argued that drafting a replacement bill behind closed doors is not unusual, and discussed various criticisms of Obamacare. Here is an assessment. Referring to a recent report from the Department of Health and Human Services, Mr. McConnell claimed that \u201cnearly two million Americans\u201d opted out of public health care exchanges, \u201cand the most common reason they cited for doing so was because it was too expensive.\u201d In his statement, Mr. McConnell was referring to mostly people who picked a plan, but then never took the final step of paying a premium and enrolling \u2014 not people who left the exchanges after paying for insurance. Of the 12.2 million people who signed up for a plan by the end of open enrollment on January 31, according to the H.H.S. report, 10.3 million had actually paid for their coverage by February \u2014 a difference of 1.9 million. But in the past, H.H.S. has estimated the number of people who paid for coverage by March. It is unclear why the government has chosen to limit the data to February this year, but the methodological difference can be significant. Those who signed up for a health care plan in the last two weeks of January \u2014 500,000 this year, by one estimate \u2014 did not actually have to pay until March. So it is premature to assume they all canceled their coverage. Mr. McConnell\u2019s claim that the \u201cmost common reason\u201d for cancellations was high cost is also exaggerated. In a separate report, the department surveyed about 4,000 people who canceled before paying a premium, 46 percent of whom cited cost as the reason. About 14 percent receive coverage elsewhere, according to an H.H.S. spokeswoman. The same report also surveyed 14,000 people who canceled coverage after paying at least a month\u2019s premiums, 27 percent of whom said they canceled because of affordability. About 60 percent said they obtained insurance through their employer, and another 22 percent said they became eligible for Medicare. A May report from H.H.S. estimated that average exchange premiums in 2017 were 105 percent higher than average individual market premiums in 2013. That comparison, however, is imperfect, as H.H.S. itself acknowledges. First, the report looks only at the sticker price of premiums, discounting the fact that a vast majority of exchange enrollees receive a subsidy that helps blunt premium costs. Second, the plans and the insurance pools of 2013 are not the same as those of 2017. Some plans may have been cheaper in 2013, but covered so little that they would now fail to meet the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s definition of insurance. Under the health care law, insurers can no longer deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions. Predictably, more comprehensive plans that cover more and sicker people are costlier. And perhaps most importantly, the report compares two fundamentally different universes of plans: those in the entire individual market in 2013 and those only in the federal exchange in 2017. Mr. McConnell suggested Democrats repeatedly refused to cooperate with Republican \u201cideas on a better way forward.\u201d His office did not respond to a request for clarification, but whether he is referring to legislation to repeal, roll back or amend the current health care law, he is incorrect. The Congressional Research Service recently cataloged legislative efforts to repeal, defund or delay the Affordable Care Act from 2011 to 2016. It listed 20 enacted bills that altered funding, some of which passed with overwhelming bipartisan support. Democratic leadership, and most of the caucus, have consistently rejected efforts to repeal the health care law. But even a few of the approximately 40 bills passed in the House that sought to undo parts or all of the Affordable Care Act garnered limited Democratic \u201cyes\u201d votes. A spokesman for Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Senate minority leader, gave several recent examples of Democrats\u2019 requesting to be involved in the health care reform process. Responding to criticisms that Senate Republicans are drafting the health care bill behind closed doors, Mr. McConnell charged Democrats with procedural hypocrisy. Mr. McConnell, who repeatedly chastised Democrats for \u201cgoing the partisan route\u201d and for secrecy as the Affordable Care Act was being drafted, is right that part of the health care law was eventually passed through reconciliation \u2014 a tactic that allows Congress to push through legislation with a simple majority, rather than the 60 votes typically needed in the Senate. But selectively focusing on the last step of the current health care law\u2019s history ignores months of debate that included more than 20 hearings, at least 100 hours of committee meetings and markups, more than 130 amendments considered and at least 79 roll-call votes. Mr. McConnell is also making misleading remarks about how reconciliation was used in the Affordable Care Act\u2019s passage. Both the House and the Senate passed versions of the bill \u2014 by 243 to 173 and by 60 to 39 \u2014 before Democrats lost their 60th Senate vote and resorted to reconciliation. In contrast, Senate Republicans intend to overhaul health care through a reconciliation bill, bypassing the 60-vote threshold entirely. The process would still allow senators to debate on the floor for 20 hours and offer amendments, but that would be significantly less than the time spent discussing the Affordable Care Act.",

      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump lashed out on Wednesday at the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, who suggested this week that the president harbored \u201cexcessive expectations\u201d about the pace of congressional progress. \u201cSenator Mitch McConnell said I had \u2018excessive expectations,\u2019 but I don\u2019t think so,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter on Wednesday afternoon, as he and lawmakers took time away from Washington during the August recess. \u201cAfter 7 years of hearing Repeal & Replace, why not done?\u201d The executive scolding followed the president\u2019s bitter disappointment with the Senate\u2019s failure to dismantle the Affordable Care Act last month \u2014 and supplied perhaps the most potent evidence yet that Mr. Trump, seething over the lack of major achievements in his first year, will not hesitate to train fire on allies. Before Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet, he spoke by phone with Mr. McConnell to express his disappointment in the senator\u2019s comments, according to a person with knowledge of the call. Growing animated, Mr. Trump emphasized that he would continue to push for a repeal, the person said, and suggested Mr. McConnell do the same. Mr. McConnell\u2019s office declined to confirm the call or address questions about it. His message echoed the criticisms in recent days from many conservative news media figures and activists, who blame Mr. McConnell for failing to corral the necessary 51 votes to keep the repeal effort alive. Yet by antagonizing Mr. McConnell, the president\u2019s often inscrutable Senate partner in conservative policy making, Mr. Trump risks upending an already charged relationship with lawmakers who have joined him in this shotgun marriage of unified Republican government. Mr. McConnell\u2019s team sought to play down any animosity, noting that he also hopes to proceed on a repeal of the Affordable Care Act, despite the setbacks. \u201cThe leader has spoken repeatedly about the path forward regarding Obamacare repeal on the Senate floor, at media availabilities multiple times and in Kentucky,\u201d his spokeswoman, Antonia Ferrier, said in an email. \u201cIf he has any new statements, I\u2019ll be sure to pass them along.\u201d Mr. McConnell\u2019s initial remarks were pointed, but hardly scorching. Speaking at a gathering this week in Kentucky, Mr. McConnell mounted a defense of the chamber\u2019s work, arguing that complicated legislation takes time. \u201cPart of the reason I think that the story line is that we haven\u2019t done much is because, in part, the president and others have set these early timelines about things need to be done by a certain point,\u201d the senator said. \u201cOur new president, of course, has not been in this line of work before. And I think he had excessive expectations about how quickly things happen in the democratic process.\u201d Though he has generally been a loyal steward of the president\u2019s agenda, Mr. McConnell has tweaked him at times this year, including several pointed dismissals of Mr. Trump\u2019s calls to do away with the legislative filibuster. Mr. McConnell has also repeatedly encouraged the president to tweet less. On Wednesday, Republicans in Washington were reminded why, particularly as the party seeks to confront tax policy, a debt ceiling deadline and perhaps a revived health care repeal push when lawmakers return next month. \u201cAttacking the Senate majority leader of your own party is utterly incomprehensible and completely wrongheaded,\u201d said Michael Steel, a Republican strategist who was an aide to the former House speaker John A. Boehner and to Jeb Bush, a Republican presidential candidate in 2016. \u201cThere is no positive result for the president or his agenda in these attacks.\u201d It is unclear how Mr. McConnell\u2019s remarks, made Monday at a Rotary Club event, hit the president\u2019s radar. As recently as Tuesday evening, Mr. Trump was deploying his Twitter account for a cause Mr. McConnell cherishes, endorsing Senator Luther Strange, Republican of Alabama, a week before his Republican primary in a special election. Mr. McConnell has been seeking to boost Mr. Strange, who took office after Mr. Trump named Jeff Sessions as his attorney general.",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 For Republicans trying to rally their base, no political villain has been more effective than Representative Nancy Pelosi, the longtime Democratic leader. In campaign after campaign, they made her the symbol of the Washington they claimed to be running against. Now a renegade group of anti-establishment Republicans is adapting that model and turning it against their own party. They are replacing Ms. Pelosi with Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader. \u201cHe is an anvil,\u201d said L. Brent Bozell III, a longtime conservative activist who on Wednesday joined a group of a half-dozen activists from the right demanding that Mr. McConnell and his leadership team step down. \u201cNot with Democrats,\u201d he said, \u201cbut with his own party. This is the trouble that he\u2019s in.\u201d Mr. McConnell was an ever-present boogeyman in the recent primary campaign in Alabama between Senator Luther Strange, a McConnell ally, and Roy Moore, the deeply conservative former state Supreme Court judge who ran on a caustically anti-leadership message. Mr. Moore won in an upset, despite being attacked with millions of dollars from groups loyal to Mr. McConnell as a zealot who was removed twice from the bench for refusing to obey orders from higher courts. A faction of conservative activists, including President Trump\u2019s former chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, now hopes to replicate that kind of grassroots-fueled victory across the country. But their targets are not where the rest of the Republican Party is aiming \u2014 states with Democratic senators that Mr. Trump won where there are large pockets of conservative voters \u2014 but in seven states where Republicans already hold a Senate seat. Many Republicans consider this strategy suicidal. \u201cThis is the reason that Republicans didn\u2019t regain the majority in 2010 and 2012,\u201d said Josh Holmes, a former aide to Mr. McConnell who is president of Cavalry Strategies in Washington. \u201cYou had this for-profit, quote, unquote conservative crowd who found it much more entrepreneurial to challenge from within than to fight back against Democrats. And ultimately what happened in those two cycles is that Democrats won. Republicans exhausted their resources.\u201d Using attacks on Republican leaders like Mr. McConnell and Speaker Paul D. Ryan as a way to motivate voters on the right \u2014 and to raise money \u2014 is nothing new for groups that have tried for years to push Republicans to toe a harder, less compromising line. But to make such a senior leader of their own party the public face of a national campaign to unseat fellow Republicans represents a new level of hostility. As Mr. Bannon looks to recruit Republicans to run in those seven states where Republican seats are up \u2014 Arizona, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, Tennessee, Utah and Wyoming \u2014 he has asked them whether they will commit to a pledge not to vote for Mr. McConnell as leader. Those who refrain from making the pledge cannot win his endorsement, or the funding source that comes with it. Many conservatives believe that Mr. Moore won in Alabama in large part because of the harsh criticism he leveled at Mr. McConnell and Republican leaders in Washington. \u201cMitch McConnell was an albatross around Luther Strange\u2019s neck, much like Nancy Pelosi has been used against Democrats,\u201d said Ken Cuccinelli, president of the Senate Conservatives Fund, which often targets Republicans who are close to leaders like Mr. McConnell. \u201cThat is not going to change,\u201d Mr. Cuccinelli added. \u201cAnd that makes all of these folks vulnerable, so long as they stay on that team.\u201d On Wednesday, the leaders of groups that included FreedomWorks and the Tea Party Patriots presented Mr. McConnell with a list of their grievances. He had failed, they said, to do anything to stop illegal immigration, reduce the deficit, shrink the federal bureaucracy or cut off funding to Planned Parenthood. But their biggest grievance by far was the lack of movement toward repealing the Affordable Care Act, which they put squarely on his shoulders. \u201cMitch McConnell had his chance. The entire Republican leadership had its chance. They have failed,\u201d said Jenny Beth Martin, co-founder of the Tea Party Patriots. The toxicity of Republicans in Washington is a problem that even those who are working to re-elect them acknowledge. \u201cNow the answer to what is wrong in Washington is the Republican Congress,\u201d Steven Law, president of the pro-McConnell Senate Leadership Fund, wrote in a memo after the Moore upset. The prospect of incumbent Republicans fighting on two fronts \u2014 against insurgent candidates in states where they should be safe and against Democratic challengers in states where Mr. Trump is a liability \u2014 all while trying to pass a major tax bill does not seem to concern the conservatives who are calling for Mr. McConnell\u2019s ouster. In fact, it seems to be something they welcome. \u201cIt is time for you and your leadership team to step aside,\u201d the leaders of the conservative groups wrote in a letter to the majority leader on Wednesday. \u201cAmerican is too good for you to lead it.\u201d",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump was walking through the Capitol corridors in February, en route to his State of the Union address, when he spied Mitch McConnell, the taciturn Senate majority leader, and rumbled over to deliver his signature verbal high-five. \u201cMitch!\u201d Mr. Trump said in a voice loud enough to be heard by a Republican aide pinned against a nearby wall. \u201cI just saw you on Fox! You were totally great with Martha MacCallum!\u201d he added, referring to a prespeech TV appearance in which he denounced the shutdown Mr. Trump initiated against his advice. Mr. McConnell, of Kentucky, who grumbled in private about Mr. Trump\u2019s decision, managed a laugh. The senator, allergic to public glad-handing, would have preferred a more substantive interaction. He had spent much of that week urging Mr. Trump, unsuccessfully, to abandon his plan to declare a national emergency at the border with Mexico to secure wall funds that Congress had denied him. But the exchange captured the essence of an awkward, compulsory yet increasingly close working relationship between two men divided by temperament but Krazy Glued together by shared self-interest. Over the last six months, necessity has cast Mr. McConnell into a new role \u2014 as one of the president\u2019s most important counselors, upping the pace and intensity of his one-on-one interactions. Nowadays, he speaks with Mr. Trump nearly every day and far more frequently during times of crisis, according to interviews with two dozen lawmakers, White House aides and administration officials. \u201cThe president talks to the leader a lot \u2014 and vice versa,\u201d said Senator Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama. Seeking little credit \u2014 and getting even less \u2014 Mr. McConnell has expedited virtually everything Mr. Trump has asked of him since 2017, rolling back Obama-era regulations, ramming through a giant tax cut that has driven up an already high budget deficit and playing wingman to the White House on contentious nominations, even those he had questioned, like  Brett M. Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court. But critics say Mr. McConnell\u2019s acquiescence \u2014 he even strong-armed Senate rule changes to ease the president\u2019s nominations to confirmation \u2014 has only encouraged Mr. Trump to go further out of the mainstream. While other Republicans have openly questioned Mr. Trump\u2019s intention to nominate a former pizza magnate, Herman Cain, and a conservative commentator, Stephen Moore, to the Federal Reserve Board, Mr. McConnell has held his tongue. He has scarcely mentioned last week\u2019s jarring shake-up at the Department of Homeland Security. And Congress has left for a two-week spring recess without passing a popular and much-in-demand disaster relief bill, in large part because Mr. McConnell does not want to provoke Mr. Trump by adding money for Puerto Rico that Democrats are demanding but the president is refusing. Mr. McConnell, speaking in his office last week, promoted his collaboration with the White House on nominations and tax reform but pushed back when asked if Mr. Trump\u2019s unpredictable behavior had hijacked his legacy. \u201cMy legacy is shaped by how I handle myself and what I do,\u201d he said. \u201cHe sends up the nominees and signs the bills.\u201d Democrats disagree. \u201cAnyone that deals with the president is part of the Trump message,\u201d said former Senator Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat who was majority leader, when asked about Mr. McConnell during a phone interview on Saturday. \u201cIt\u2019s not anything you want to define who you are, you know, by virtue of Donald Trump. But they are stuck with him. It\u2019s too bad.\u201d Mr. McConnell has been willing to express his opinions to the president in private. He vehemently opposed the emergency declaration at the border, continues to noodge him on tariffs and trade, counseled the president not to appoint Ryan Zinke as interior secretary, pushed him not to withdraw troops from Syria and has, from time to time, even urged him to cool it on Twitter. \u201cI think Senator McConnell is not hesitant to give his advice, and the president appears to be increasingly willing to listen to that advice,\u201d said Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri. Sean Spicer, Mr. Trump\u2019s first press secretary, added, \u201cI think the president has come around to the idea that Mitch is as good at his job as he is at real estate.\u201d The two men are not personally close, but the leader has always had an open line to the president. Until recently, Mr. McConnell preferred to discuss granular details with intermediaries, especially former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and the former White House Counsel Donald F. McGahn II. Two factors have made that approach less attractive: the arrival of Mick Mulvaney, a former Freedom Caucus hard-liner in the House, as acting White House chief of staff and the diminished clout of Vice President Mike Pence as a dealmaker. In closed-door meetings with negotiators during the longest government shutdown in the nation\u2019s history, Mr. Pence, with Mr. Trump\u2019s blessing, offered a compromise to reopen the government that would have provided about half of the $5.7 billion that Mr. Trump had publicly demanded. Mr. Trump shot it down. Soon after, Mr. McConnell told one fellow Republican senator that Mr. Pence, while well intentioned, could not be entirely relied upon as a negotiator who spoke for the president. David Popp, a spokesman for the majority leader, said it was \u201cunfair and untrue\u201d to say Mr. McConnell had lost faith in the vice president. But Mr. McConnell has told allies he is convinced that the only way to sway Mr. Trump is one-on-one, preferably with no one else in the room, since leaks appear inevitable when Mr. Trump summons aides and relatives to his Oval Office free-for-alls. During the February debate over the border wall, Mr. McConnell took it one step further, requesting an early-morning meeting with Mr. Trump in the White House residence, according to a person later briefed on the meeting. Cozying up to Mr. Trump does not come naturally to Mr. McConnell, who has a sly, sometimes self-lacerating, sense of humor. Mr. Trump surrounds himself with self-aggrandizing magazine covers; by contrast, Mr. McConnell\u2019s office in Louisville is decorated with political cartoons depicting him as, among other things, a turtle. Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, who has courted Mr. Trump relentlessly, has stepped in with some advice for Mr. McConnell. \u201cYour biggest problem is that he thinks you only call him with bad news,\u201d Mr. Graham told the leader recently, according to a senator who was present for the exchange. \u201cYou got to keep positive, get in fast and get out fast.\u201d Mr. McConnell prefers more businesslike interactions. On health care, he was direct; he called Mr. Trump to deliver a verdict \u2014 \u201cno way\u201d would he go along with a new effort to repeal the health law. \u201cI told him that this was not going to be on the agenda,\u201d Mr. McConnell informed senators week at a recent Tuesday lunch. Other times, Mr. McConnell sends his message more by what he does not do than what he does. The president\u2019s emergency declaration was a flagrant violation of Congress\u2019s constitutional prerogative to control the federal purse strings, an issue dear to the majority leader, a longtime member of the Appropriations Committee. Since Mr. McConnell had used the declaration as a way to reopen the government, he could hardly vote to overturn it. But he did almost nothing to stem the defection of a dozen Republicans, an embarrassing rebuke. Before the vote, he instructed members to \u201cvote your politics,\u201d freeing them to do whatever they pleased. Mr. Trump was infuriated, telling a visitor to Mar-a-Lago, the president\u2019s club in Palm Beach, Fla., that he felt let down by Mr. McConnell. None of this impresses Democrats. Neither Mr. McConnell nor Mr. Trump has proposed a serious policy agenda for the next year, they say, apart from changing procedural rules in the Senate to keep the \u201cconveyor belt\u201d of Trump judicial and subcabinet appointments humming. \u201cWhen Democrats were in the majority, we had a positive legislative agenda that would help the middle class in this country,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. \u201cThe Senate Republican agenda for the last two years has been to do whatever Donald Trump tweeted that morning.\u201d Mr. McConnell\u2019s approach is rooted in his personal political realities: He cannot afford to have the president, whose support with the party\u2019s base remains solid, turn on him. He is also up for re-election next year, in a state enthralled with Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump has mostly spared Mr. McConnell the scorching disdain he had for former Speaker Paul D. Ryan, who had criticized Mr. Trump\u2019s personal behavior. The president has told people that he considered Mr. McConnell \u201cstiff\u201d and \u201cboring,\u201d but that is about it. The obvious differences between Mr. Trump and Mr. McConnell obscure equally obvious similarities. Both are obsessed with winning; both are transactional, both have a highly attuned sense of self-preservation, both are obsessed with getting re-elected. Another tie that binds: Mr. McConnell\u2019s wife, Elaine Chao, is his transportation secretary. The leader has been unapologetic about leveraging that connection to bring increased funding to Kentucky. But managing Mr. Trump with Mr. Mulvaney in the president\u2019s ear is challenging. Mr. Mulvaney goaded Mr. Trump into forcing the government shutdown in December, then tried to blow up the final deal to reopen it. Mr. Mulvaney, among others, helped sell the president on a short-lived effort to press congressional Republicans to try again to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. While Mr. McConnell does not interact with Mr. Mulvaney much, he did reach out to him last year, when Mr. Mulvaney was running the White House budget office, to ask that the president request $400 million for a new Department of Veterans Affairs hospital in Louisville, according to a person with direct knowledge of the conversation. Mr. Mulvaney said yes.",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Senator Mitch McConnell has a ready comeback for Democrats who keep chanting \u201cdo your job\u201d in hopes of pressuring Republicans to consider President Obama\u2019s Supreme Court nominee. It is simply, \u201cWe are.\u201d With a little guile and an agenda of limited ambition, Mr. McConnell of Kentucky, the Senate majority leader, can point to a number of legislative victories, complete with Democratic support. And he is not shy about boasting. \u201cThis week we have seen what can be accomplished on behalf of the American people with a Senate that\u2019s back to work under the Republican majority,\u201d Mr. McConnell declared in a floor speech on Wednesday, minutes before passage of a bipartisan energy bill and a day after the adoption of legislation to tighten aviation standards. \u201cWe just passed two broad-based bills aimed at protecting consumers and modernizing our energy policies respectively, and both bills take important steps to bolster national security,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201cThe Republican-led Senate has made important strides to get the legislative process functioning again.\u201d On those issues and others, like the opioid crisis, Democrats are actually helping him, even if some are not happy about it. Last week, Mr. McConnell pushed through a bill to fight abuse of painkillers and heroin, adding to his growing list of bipartisan achievements. Given the Senate rules, under which 60 votes are needed to break filibusters, Mr. McConnell cannot win adoption of anything unless Democrats refrain from his strategy when he was in the minority, which was to block virtually everything. Democrats complain that Mr. McConnell is passing versions of some of the same bills that he blocked when Democrats were in control. Still, Democrats are going along, helping Mr. McConnell create a new sense of productivity in the Senate. But they are also betting that Republicans\u2019 refusal to consider the nomination of Judge Merrick B. Garland to the Supreme Court will cement an image in voters\u2019 minds of Republicans as the party of \u201cno.\u201d Some Democrats say they would never want to share a reputation for obstruction. Others say Democrats are almost genetically incapable of refusing to deal, while a less kind analysis might say they cannot maintain the discipline in their ranks necessary to stop Mr. McConnell\u2019s initiatives. Whatever the motivation, in this hotly contested election year, Democrats are making a risky wager that it is better to share some credit for legislative progress, an approach that could undermine their mantra on the campaign trail that Senate Republicans, by refusing to consider the nominee for the court vacancy, are not doing their jobs. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, who is positioned to become the Democratic leader next year, said he believed no issue would matter more than the court. \u201cAll of these nice accomplishments will not get the Republicans well because they will be dwarfed by their obstruction on the Supreme Court,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it\u2019s a futile attempt.\u201d Republicans say that the better-functioning Senate is a testament to Mr. McConnell\u2019s leadership, especially his willingness to give individual senators more freedom to offer amendments, and to his focus on legislation that has a chance of winning passage. Asked why more legislation seemed to be moving, Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, did not break stride as she walked toward the internal subway system in the Capitol basement. \u201cBecause the Republicans are in charge,\u201d Ms. Collins said, \u201cwe have a true commitment to restoring the traditions of the Senate of open debate, amendments on bills.\u201d She also pointed to a major education bill negotiated last year by Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, and Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge difference,\u201d Ms. Collins said. \u201cCertainly, there has been Democratic cooperation, and I want to acknowledge and emphasize that, but it has been Republican leadership.\u201d Republicans, however, have struggled to pursue policies that strictly reflect their conservative priorities, not only because of Mr. Obama\u2019s veto power, but also because of fierce internal disagreements that have forced Republican leaders, particularly in the House, to rely on Democratic votes. House Republicans have been unable to agree on a budget, for instance, because of opposition from hard-line conservatives. Still, Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin was happy to turn the Democrats\u2019 arguments around in praise of the Senate. \u201cThey\u2019re actually legislating,\u201d Mr. Ryan said on Thursday at a news conference. Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, who has taken the brunt of criticism over the refusal to convene confirmation hearings on Judge Garland, said the Democrats were wrong to think that voters would focus only on the fight over the Supreme Court vacancy. \u201cThe court is one issue, and everything else is other issues,\u201d Mr. Grassley said in an interview. \u201cIf Scalia hadn\u2019t died,\u201d he said, referring to Justice Antonin Scalia, \u201cwe\u2019d still be doing the same thing we\u2019re doing here.\u201d At the start of the current Congress, some Democrats pushed to block all of the Republicans\u2019 legislative initiatives. That strategy might have denied some vulnerable incumbents the upbeat advertising that inevitably flows from having laws adopted, like the commercials in Ohio now touting a measure by Senator Rob Portman, a Republican, to fight the opioid epidemic. Mr. Schumer said such an approach would have been futile. \u201cWe\u2019re Democrats,\u201d he said. \u201cWe cannot just block everything. We believe in government.\u201d Some centrist Democrats, like Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, whose policy goals are more likely to align with those of Republicans, have been among the biggest beneficiaries of the current atmosphere, passing bills like a repeal of a 40-year-old ban on crude oil exports. Ms. Heitkamp, however, gave credit to the Democrats. \u201cWe have become a much more effective minority because a lot of the stuff that is getting done is a product of compromise,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a product of sitting down and moving the packages that need to be moved.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a much more effective minority than majority,\u201d she added. \u201cThese are not the bills that would pass if Republicans were solely in charge.\u201d Senator Maria Cantwell of Washington State, a Democrat, who negotiated the recently adopted energy bill with Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, a Republican, said some of the recent accomplishments masked deeper dysfunction. In some cases, she said, Republicans were helping pass legislation they had previously blocked, while on other issues Republicans were still refusing to cooperate, particularly on nominees. \u201cNominees or courts, it\u2019s pretty frustrating,\u201d Ms. Cantwell said. \u201cThey are over there holding up an appointee to the Export-Import Bank. They won\u2019t reappoint somebody to the F.C.C. You can\u2019t point to it and say it\u2019s a good process, and then not follow it in other areas.\u201d But Mr. McConnell has been effective doing just that.",

      "content": " HYDEN, Ky. \u2014 Mitch McConnell, flanked by animal feed and a stuffed coyote, urged the small Republican crowd in Begley\u2019s General Store here to beat the Democrats \u201clike a drum\u201d and \u201crun up the score.\u201d When an older woman seated in a front row lawn chair screamed that his opponent, Alison Lundergan Grimes, would \u201clie like Obama\u201d if elected, he chuckled and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to take you on the road.\u201d But after posing for pictures with a long line of people, Mr. McConnell cupped his mouth and whispered in the store owner\u2019s ear. \u201cWe\u2019ll get \u2019em out. We\u2019ll get \u2019em out,\u201d Tate Begley assured him, explaining later that Mr. McConnell had confided he was \u201cworried about a small county like this, and voter turnout.\u201d If Republicans take back the Senate, Mr. McConnell stands to achieve his dream of becoming majority leader. But first he must defeat a Democratic upstart half his age. With support for Ms. Grimes strongest in big cities like Louisville, Mr. McConnell\u2019s path to victory runs through the hilly coal fields in the east, the buzzing sheet metal factories along the state\u2019s southern tier and in the barns leaking with pouring rain in the flat and cow-spotted western farmland. On Monday and Tuesday, Mr. McConnell rode in his navy blue campaign bus to more than a dozen such spots, past Elk Mountain and over the \u201cLand between the Lakes,\u201d by an obelisk honoring Jefferson Davis and a sign for the birthplace of the writer Robert Penn Warren. At the end of his 14 campaign rallies and hundreds of miles lined with falling orange and ocher autumn leaves, Mr. McConnell seemed to have reached a better, less anxious, place. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s been a big race,\u201d he said after the final rally at a western Kentucky farm in Murray, where \u201cTeam Mitch\u201d had dramatically lighted a backdrop of grain silos. \u201cWe are in a very good position to win. And I think we will.\u201d Mr. McConnell, a shrewd yet often plodding politician whose nickname on Capitol Hill is \u201cthe Turtle,\u201d is famously difficult to read. One of his closest friends in politics, former Senator Robert F. Bennett of Utah, has said that a loss just as Republicans take over the Senate would be \u201cdevastating\u201d for Mr. McConnell. But throughout the campaign swing this week, the senator\u2019s face remained frozen. He insisted that he did not even allow himself a moment to look out the bus window to savor what could be his last campaign. \u201cI don\u2019t spend a lot of time reminiscing,\u201d Mr. McConnell said in an interview at the National Corvette Museum in Bowling Green, where he expressed fascination with a sinkhole  that had swallowed up some of the cars. \u201cReminiscing is for people to do when they are thinking about the past. I\u2019m thinking about the future. The election\u2019s about the next six years, not what I\u2019ve done in the past.\u201d But an aura of the past, both Mr. McConnell\u2019s and Kentucky\u2019s, hung in the air like the acrid smell in the hills around the endangered coal mines. He called it a \u201ctreat\u201d to meet a woman in Liberty who asked him to sign a picture of a much-younger Mr. McConnell hoisting her in the air in 1984 when she was 5 and he was a first-time candidate for the Senate. In Hopkinsville, he said \u201cHi, kiddo\u201d to Marilyn Hays, 85, a local Republican matriarch who carried an oxygen tank and a sign reading \u201cSwitch to Mitch! 1984, Stick with Mitch 2014! 30 Years together!\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s always a sense of nostalgia,\u201d said Billy Piper, a veteran of many McConnell races, who added that as the bus approached a Casey County Pork Producers hall in Liberty, Mr. McConnell recalled a woman who would always greet him there with RC Colas and Moon Pies. But the old memories did not mean the atmosphere was bleak. In fact, Mr. Piper and others on the bus called the mood \u201ccelebratory,\u201d especially when contrasted with the 2008 election, when Mr. McConnell had to scratch out a victory amid a national Democratic wave. Aboard the bus, Team Mitch ate cupcakes for the 72nd birthday of the country singer Lee Greenwood, the campaign\u2019s musical attraction, and Mr. McConnell, who is also 72, checked on poll numbers in Alaska and Kansas, in the hope he would have a majority to lead. There was talk of five- to seven-point leads, rumors of Kentucky Democrats already speculating about whom Ms. Grimes would challenge after she loses on Tuesday. Volunteers, mostly young and female, wore Team Mitch sweatshirts and ginned up an atmosphere of momentum by cheering atop tractor tires. Through it all, Mr. McConnell went to work. He started early Monday morning on the loading dock of the Kentucky Power Company in Hazard, the heart of coal country, where he wore pleated khakis, a green polo shirt and a Team Mitch golf jacket. For 15 minutes he offered up red meat about Obama\u2019s \u201cwar on coal,\u201d with a healthy serving of talk about his own impending power. In speech after speech, he noted that reporters from Norway, Sweden and Al Jazeera (cue the gasps) had come to see him because the fate of America hung in the balance. \u201cI\u2019ve been elected four times to leadership without opposition,\u201d he said with pride, and pointed out, \u201cMy leadership has nothing to do with seniority.\u201d At an event in London, Ky., Representative Harold Rogers, who had joined Mr. McConnell on the trail, spoke in almost magical terms of Mr. McConnell\u2019s potential ascension to majority leader. \u201cHow many of you,\u201d he asked, \u201chave ever touched one?\u201d Mr. McConnell spoke with disdain of a White House filled with \u201ccollege professors and community organizers\u201d who \u201clook down their noses at us.\u201d (Never mind that Mr. McConnell once taught a college class and is, through his wife, Elaine Chao, one of the wealthiest members of Congress.) In the mining counties he talked suspiciously of global carbon emissions. In Hazard, he said, \u201cjust for the sake of discussion, let\u2019s grant that could be a problem\u201d and in Manchester, where a giant pile of coal was cherry-topped with a tractor, he said of global warming, \u201cAll right, for those who think that\u2019s important.\u201d He invariably closed with a call to arms, noting that Democrats and President Obama were doing everything possible to knock him out. \u201cWe want him to have a bad night a week from tonight, too!\u201d he yelled to applause. \u201cI think he\u2019s going to pull out the victory and I think you can thank Barack Obama for it,\u201d said Steve Campbell, 58, a worker at the Hazard plant and a registered Democrat. Mr. Obama\u2019s deep unpopularity in Kentucky has bolstered Mr. McConnell\u2019s chances, but the Republican is well aware of his limitations as a retail campaigner. To supplement a deficit of charisma, he has throughout his career raised enormous amounts of money and taken positions that his critics believe are the essence of get-elected-at-all-costs political cynicism. But as the race came to a close, and he desperately needed to raise the enthusiasm of his core Republican supporters, his campaign called on Mr. Greenwood, whose song \u201cGod Bless the U.S.A.\u201d has become the anthem for many conservative Republicans. \u201cThey made an overture to us\u201d said Mr. Greenwood, who added he had been invited by a host of Republican campaigns. \u201cBut I\u2019ve got to put my clout where I think it\u2019s valuable.\u201d And with each successive introduction, Mr. McConnell sought to increase Mr. Greenwood\u2019s significance. He started as an \u201cicon,\u201d became the man who \u201chas put to music more effectively than anyone who has ever lived how we feel about this country\u201d and ended up as the author of a song that will \u201coutlive you in its influence on the country and its future direction.\u201d Mr. Greenwood, in turn, tried to pass some of that importance back to Mr. McConnell. At the first stop in Hazard, Mr. Greenwood took Mr. McConnell by surprise when he lifted the senator\u2019s arm as he sang, \u201cI\u2019ll gladly stand up next to you.\u201d Mr. McConnell smiled and his cheeks reddened into crab apples. Mr. Greenwood did the same move at each successive event. By the last stop in Murray, Mr. McConnell was reaching out in anticipation as Mr. Greenwood approached the line. The senator sang along, and moved his free hand with the music. Yes, Mr. McConnell is hard to read. But by Tuesday evening, a week before the election, he did not seem so nervous at all.",

      "content": " The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, would not rule out the possibility of rescinding his endorsement of Donald J. Trump\u2019s presidential bid down the road, and he described the candidate as lacking knowledge in a number of areas in an interview released on Friday. The comments from Mr. McConnell, in an interview with the \u201cMasters in Politics\u201d podcast on Bloomberg Politics, came as Republicans down the ballot continue to face questions about Mr. Trump\u2019s criticism of the Indiana-born federal judge overseeing a case against Trump University as \u201cMexican.\u201d Mr. McConnell has been pointed in his criticism of those remarks. It was the first time, though, that Mr. McConnell offered anything less than an ironclad response of sticking with Mr. Trump, despite the numerous controversies that the presumptive Republican nominee has instigated. Asked if there was a line that Mr. Trump could cross that would prompt Mr. McConnell to rescind his endorsement, Mr. McConnell demurred. \u201cI\u2019m not going to speculate about what he might say or what I might do,\u201d said the senator from Kentucky. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s pretty clear. I\u2019ve been very clear publicly about how I think he ought to change directions, and I hope that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to see.\u201d This week, Senator Mark Kirk of Illinois, one of the most vulnerable Republicans in the Senate, withdrew his endorsement of Mr. Trump over the remarks about Judge Gonzalo P. Curiel. Senator Lindsey Graham, who has not endorsed Mr. Trump, urged other Republicans to follow Mr. Kirk\u2019s lead. At another point, Mr. McConnell said that he was \u201ccomfortable\u201d with supporting Mr. Trump at the moment, suggesting that the candidate would face checks and balances that could curtail him should he get elected. \u201cFor all of his obvious shortcomings, Donald Trump is certainly a different direction, and I think if he is in the White House he\u2019ll have to respond to the right-of-center world which elected him, and the things that we believe in,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201cSo I\u2019m comfortable supporting him.\u201d But he condemned Mr. Trump\u2019s lack of preparedness, and said that he will need to factor that into his choice of running mate. \u201cHe needs someone highly experienced and very knowledgeable because it\u2019s pretty obvious he doesn\u2019t know a lot about the issues,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201cYou see that in the debates in which he\u2019s participated. It\u2019s why I have argued to him publicly and privately that he ought to use a script more often \u2014 there is nothing wrong with having prepared texts.\u201d",

But Mr. Reid, the Democratic minority leader from Nevada, says he is becoming increasingly impressed by Mr. McConnell\u2019s skills of persuasion as the majority leader. Sort of impressed, anyway. In an interview, Mr. Reid said he doubted he could have ever persuaded his fellow Democrats to go on a \u201cfool\u2019s errand\u201d such as stonewalling the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Merrick B. Garland, refusing to schedule hearings and in multiple cases deciding against even a courtesy meeting with the nominee. \u201cIf anybody can get his senators to all agree to go over a cliff and kill themselves, that\u2019s pretty good,\u201d Mr. Reid said in his deadpan manner. \u201cBoy, I will tell you that guy has a lot more sway with his caucus than I ever had. If I ever suggested something as absurd and bizarre as that to my caucus, they would revote and kick the hell out of me out of the caucus. I mean, really.\u201d Mr. Reid added that he believed the Republican refusal to take up the Garland nomination has already put Democratic contenders ahead in some Senate races. Mr. McConnell, in his new book, \u201cThe Long Game,\u201d did acknowledge that Mr. Reid can be \u201cthoughtful, friendly and funny.\u201d \u201cBut as soon as the cameras turn on or he\u2019s offered a microphone,\u201d Mr. McConnell wrote, \u201che becomes bombastic and unreasonable, spouting things that are both nasty and often untrue, forcing him to later apologize.\u201d But it is doubtful that Mr. Reid will want to apologize in this case for complimenting Mr. McConnell\u2019s abilities.

      "content": " The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday that he believed the role of women in the military had expanded so broadly in recent years that they should be required to register for the draft just as men do. Mr. McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, was quick to stress that he did not envision any return to the use of the Selective Service and believed that the volunteer, professional military had been \u201cvery successful.\u201d House Republicans had been contemplating an amendment to the annual military policy bill that would have required women to register for the Selective Service, but the Rules Committee on Monday dropped the amendment from consideration. In recent months a number of senior military officials and influential members of Congress have expressed support for the idea. It is unclear if the proposal will resurface, either during debate in the House or in the Senate version of the military policy bill. If it does, Mr. McConnell, as majority leader, certainly would hold some sway. Asked for his opinion at a news conference on Tuesday, Mr. McConnell said: \u201cFirst of all, I don\u2019t anticipate going back to the draft. The professional voluntary Army has been very successful. We\u2019re talking here about registration for Selective Service, should we ever go back to a draft. And given where we are today, with women in the military performing virtually all kinds of functions, I personally think it would be appropriate for them to register just like men do.\u201d",

But he can definitely get excited about the opportunity to trash Hillary Clinton. In his appearance at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland on Tuesday as one of several members of Congress scheduled to speak, Mr. McConnell, the majority leader, is expected to slam the presumptive Democratic nominee. A campaign aide to Mr. McConnell said the senator would focus on what he saw as Mrs. Clinton\u2019s record of failed policies and a willingness to do anything to get elected. He will argue that the case for casting a presidential vote is an easy one, particularly given the Republican desire to maintain the conservative tilt of the Supreme Court. He will also touch on one of his favorite topics: that the Senate, controlled by Republicans, is much more productive than it was under a Democratic majority. While some Republican senators in tough re-election fights have decided to pass on the party convention, there is still a fairly strong contingent in town. Joining Mr. McConnell in speaking on Tuesday will be Senator Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, who is in a tough re-election battle. Others joined Mr. McConnell at events with campaign donors Sunday night and Monday afternoon. \u201cThe turnout was greater than I expected,\u201d said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, who spent a few days in Cleveland.

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 A raft of legislation intended to better secure United States election systems after what the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, called a \u201csweeping and systematic\u201d Russian attack in 2016 is running into a one-man roadblock in the form of the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. The bills include a Democratic measure that would send more than $1 billion to state and local governments to tighten election security, but would also demand a national strategy to protect American democratic institutions against cyberattacks and require that states spend federal funds only on federally certified \u201celection infrastructure vendors.\u201d A bipartisan measure in both chambers would require internet companies like Facebook to disclose the purchasers of political ads. Another bipartisan Senate proposal would codify cyberinformation-sharing initiatives between federal intelligence services and state election officials, speed up the granting of security clearances to state officials and provide federal incentives for states to adopt paper ballots. But even bipartisan coalitions have begun to crumble in the face of the majority leader\u2019s blockade. Mr. McConnell, long the Senate\u2019s leading ideological opponent to federal regulation of elections, has told colleagues in recent months that he has no plans to consider stand-alone legislation on the matter this term, despite clamoring from members of his own conference and the growing pressure from Democrats who also sense a political advantage in trying to make the Republican response to Russia\u2019s election attack look anemic. Mr. McConnell has long been an implacable foe of legislation that mandates disclosure or limits on political donors. Critics charge that he may have another reason to stay on the sidelines: not wanting to enrage President Trump, who views almost any talk of Russia\u2019s success as questioning the legitimacy of his 2016 victory. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think there is any likelihood that we are going to move a bill that federalizes more of the election process,\u201d Senator Roy Blunt, a member of Republican leadership and a former top elections official in his home state, Missouri, said on Wednesday. \u201cOur focus will be on being sure that we are supporting the state and local governments that have run and will be the best people to run elections.\u201d As Mr. McConnell and his allies see it, the federal government is already doing enough \u2014 through executive branch initiatives, a 2017 package of Russia sanctions, $380 million in grants Congress allocated to states last year \u2014 to satisfy that obligation. A spokesman for Mr. McConnell, Doug Andres, declined to comment. But in his speech last month declaring the \u201ccase closed\u201d on the 2016 election investigation, Mr. McConnell noted, \u201cWe just had the 2018 midterm elections. Thanks to this administration\u2019s leadership, all 50 states and more than 1,400 local election jurisdictions focused on election security like never before,\u201d adding, \u201cThanks to efforts across the federal government, in 2018, we were ready.\u201d \u201cThese threats and challenges are real,\u201d he concluded. \u201cOur responsibility to strengthen America is serious.\u201d Advocates for congressional action in both parties are not giving up. \u201cLeader McConnell would just like the issue to go away,\u201d Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said this week in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to let that happen.\u201d Mr. Schumer and others point to continued warnings from the American law enforcement and intelligence officials monitoring Russia and other foreign adversaries \u2014 including Mr. Mueller \u2014 who say the threat against the American political process may only be growing. Adding to concerns are reports that Mr. Trump\u2019s sensitivity around Russia might be hindering the executive branch\u2019s response and surveys that show more than a dozen states still do not have auditable paper-ballot backup systems. Dozens more say they lack the funds to replace aging and potentially vulnerable election technology. \u201cWe have 8,000 different election jurisdictions, and the idea that all of them are going to have the resources, the knowledge, the skills and the ability to independently safeguard our system against foreign powers is just not realistic,\u201d said Lawrence Norden, who has surveyed state election officials for the Brennan Center for Justice. \u201cWe need somebody to be leading on this. In some cases, individual states are. But given the threat, the idea that Congress is not going to have a role here for ideological purity, to me is insane.\u201d Democrats in the House majority are readying hearings and votes on election-related measures to try to force Mr. McConnell\u2019s hand, party aides said. The House Intelligence Committee, one of the panels involved, announced Friday that it would hold a series of hearings on the Russian counterintelligence threat detailed by Mr. Mueller, including the need for additional legislation. The votes will include one on the Election Security Act, a sweeping but partisan bill that proposes spending $1 billion in grants to state and local officials for replacing voting machines, hiring information technology staff and funding other security measures. But the bill also mandates the president develop a national strategy to fend off influence operations and disinformation campaigns like the ones Russia executed and promulgates new standards for vendors of election technology. The House may also consider narrower, bipartisan bills Democrats hope could attract more Republican support, like the Honest Ads Act, which would force Facebook, Google and other internet companies to disclose who is purchasing political advertising, and a bill focused solely on getting states to adopt the use of backup paper ballots. Daniel Savickas, who lobbies Congress on election-related issues for the conservative FreedomWorks, blasted the Senate majority leader for letting legislation languish: \u201cUnfortunately, all Senator McConnell wants to do is judges these days,\u201d he said. FreedomWorks has advocated a more limited federal footprint, but Mr. Savickas said that \u201cthere is a role for Congress\u201d to provide money for states to transition to paper ballot backups and to conduct \u201crisk-limiting audits\u201d after elections. Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, continues to push his Defending Elections From Threats by Establishing Redlines Act, written with Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland, that would impose mandatory sanctions on anyone who attacks an American election. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Cory Gardner of Colorado, both Republicans, together with a handful of Democrats, are pressing for crippling new sanctions on Russia to increase the penalty for its past aggression. None of that appears to be moving. Nor does the Secure Elections Act, written by Senators James Lankford, Republican of Oklahoma, and Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, which codifies cyberinformation-sharing initiatives between federal intelligence services and state election officials, speeds up the process of granting state officials security clearances and provides incentives for states to adopt the use of paper ballots. The coalition behind it is fraying in the face of a reluctant White House and a balking Mr. McConnell. \u201cMany of the things we have in the Secure Elections Act, D.H.S. is already doing,\u201d Mr. Lankford said in an interview, referring to the Department of Homeland Security. \u201cWe are trying to codify it, to say we can\u2019t forget. We get to 2022, 2024, 2026 \u2014 no one can become complacent and think the Russians or the North Koreans or the Chinese are not going to try to engage in these kind of activities.\u201d The bill was abruptly pulled before a committee vote last year, and now Republicans and Democrats are struggling to agree to changes that Mr. Lankford has advanced to try to win White House support. Ms. Klobuchar is insistent that it take steps to either mandate or incentivize postelection audits and include additional money for states to buy new software and hardware. \u201cWe are negotiating, but I am not going to agree to a significantly weakened bill,\u201d Ms. Klobuchar said in an interview. Lawmakers in both parties increasingly believe the best, albeit more limited, hope to get around Mr. McConnell could come through Congress\u2019s annual appropriations process, where Democrats have more leverage and deals are more easily cut to satisfy both parties. A spending bill passed last week by the relevant House subcommittee could serve as an opening position in negotiations. It contained $600 million for election security, with a stipulation that if states want access to the money, they must replace \u201cdirect-recording electronic voting machines with a voting system which uses an individual, durable, voter-verified paper ballot which is marked by the voter by hand or through the use of a nontabulating ballot-marking device or system.\u201d The Republican-controlled Senate Appropriations Committee is unlikely to be so generous or prescriptive, but the top Democrat on the panel, Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, said he intended to offer an amendment to provide for funding. The two chambers would be forced to meet somewhere in the middle, but a deal would depend on House and Senate leaders being able to reach agreement on top-line spending numbers for the year.",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 It has been a dreadful winter for Democrats as red state incumbents struggle to overcome President Obama\u2019s sagging popularity. But there\u2019s one person in particular Democrats still hope to beat: Mitch McConnell, the Senate minority leader. Polls say Mr. McConnell is locked in a dead heat for re-election in Kentucky. Some surveys even show him trailing Alison Lundergan Grimes, his Democratic challenger. But the polls overstate his vulnerability. A McConnell defeat would be all but unprecedented. Mr. McConnell is not only an incumbent senator who represents the party opposed to the White House in a midterm election, but he also comes from a state that opposes the president. Since 1956, only seven senators in these circumstances have lost re-election. The last time was in 1998, when John Edwards defeated Senator Lauch Faircloth in North Carolina. But 2014 is not 1998. Back then, President Bill Clinton\u2019s approval rating was in the mid-60s. Today, President Obama\u2019s ratings are mired in the low 40s. Kentucky is also not North Carolina, which only narrowly voted against Mr. Clinton. Kentucky is an extremely favorable state for a Republican candidate: It voted for Romney and McCain by an average of 25 points to the right of the country. From that perspective, there is no precedent for a McConnell defeat. No senator has lost in a state as favorable as Kentucky when the president represents the other party. And it\u2019s not even close: North Carolina, it turns out, is the closest example. States with serious reservations about the incumbent president seem unwilling to dismiss the president\u2019s opponents in the Senate. Very few incumbent senators lose re-election in states as favorable as Kentucky, period. Since 1956, only one incumbent senator has lost re-election in a state more favorable than Kentucky under any circumstance. That senator was Ted Stevens, who was convicted on seven counts of corruption just one week before the 2008 election, in a tough year for Republicans. Despite all of that, he lost by only one percentage point. He is the exception that seems to prove the rule. Mr. McConnell, of course, is not a convicted felon. And unlike Mr. Stevens, Mr. McConnell comfortably won re-election in worst-case circumstances in 2008, just one month after shepherding TARP, the bank bailout package, to passage in the Senate. Since then, Mr. Obama has alienated eastern Kentucky\u2019s coal country, traditionally the most Democratic-leaning stretch of the state. Without those voters, it is unclear whether there\u2019s still a path to victory for Democrats seeking federal office. Yet the polls show a close race. So long as that\u2019s true, Ms. Grimes can\u2019t be counted out. Still, most surveys show Ms. Grimes, Kentucky\u2019s secretary of state, polling in the low-to-mid 40s. That\u2019s not bad, but each of the last three Democratic Senate candidates in Kentucky reached 44 percent of the vote. To win, Ms. Grimes needs to make inroads into Kentucky\u2019s Republican-leaning voters, and, so far, it hasn\u2019t happened. Campaigns tend to move partisans toward their respective corners. Campaign advertisements, messages, and even gaffes, emphasize the ideological differences between the candidates and polarize voters along party lines. Mr. McConnell will spend the next eight months reminding voters that he\u2019s the president\u2019s most reliable adversary, and that control of the Senate is at stake. That message seems likely to resonate with Kentucky\u2019s anti-Obama electorate.

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 When it came to filling a Supreme Court vacancy during the 2016 presidential election year, Senator Mitch McConnell had a constant refrain: Let the people decide. But should a high court seat become open in 2020, Mr. McConnell has already decided himself. \u201cOh, we\u2019d fill it,\u201d Mr. McConnell, the Kentucky Republican and majority leader, gleefully told a friendly Chamber of Commerce audience back home in Paducah on Tuesday. Mr. McConnell regularly celebrates his history-altering 2016 decision to thwart President Barack Obama from filling a vacancy that occurred with 11 months remaining in his term, saying the seat should be kept open until a new president could be elected and inaugurated. But he has been laying the groundwork to change course ever since Donald J. Trump was elected president. Tuesday\u2019s remarks were only his most definitive: He would not be bound by the standard he himself set in preventing Judge Merrick B. Garland from being seated on the high court. The comments immediately drew howls of blatant hypocrisy from Democrats and progressive allies. They said it underscored their view that Mr. McConnell was unprincipled and acted out of purely partisan motives in 2016 when he single-handedly decided to blockade Mr. Obama\u2019s choice to replace Antonin Scalia after the court icon\u2019s death that February. \u201cThe bad faith behind McConnell\u2019s position on Merrick Garland was obvious to anyone who was paying attention at the time and is a major reason why the public increasingly views the court as a partisan institution,\u201d said Brian Fallon, who heads the progressive judicial advocacy group Demand Justice. The declaration by Mr. McConnell suggests that the makeup of the Supreme Court will again be a central issue in the 2020 campaigns for the White House and the Senate, particularly with the intensifying fight over abortion rights. The Scalia vacancy was credited with significantly aiding Mr. Trump and cementing his support on the right in 2016. Democrats, stung by the 2016 loss and the failure to seat Judge Garland, have since tried to emphasize the political import of the Supreme Court to their voters through the emergence of groups like Mr. Fallon\u2019s. The distinction that Mr. McConnell and his allies draw is that in 2016, the process of filling the Supreme Court vacancy was split between Democrats who controlled the White House and Republicans who controlled the Senate. Voters had rendered a split decision, handing the executive to Mr. Obama in 2012 and the Senate to Mr. McConnell two years later, the majority leader argued; therefore, the tiebreaker would go to the winner of the 2016 campaign. This is a line Mr. McConnell emphasized in October 2018 when he first began indicating that he was more than ready to take up a Trump nominee in 2020, should the chance arise. \u201cThe tradition going back to the 1880s has been if a vacancy occurs in a presidential election year, and there is a different party in control of the Senate than the presidency, it is not filled,\u201d he said. But that was a nuance that Mr. McConnell and his allies stressed infrequently during the Garland blockade. They preferred a more straightforward message that a presidential election was approaching \u2014 was, in fact, underway through primaries \u2014 and that voters should determine who filled the seat. \u201cThe American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court justice,\u201d Mr. McConnell announced in a stunning statement the evening of Justice Scalia\u2019s death. \u201cTherefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president.\u201d Mr. McConnell\u2019s office on Wednesday circulated a memo showing instances when he mentioned the Senate-White House divide and said he was being consistent \u2014 an assertion Democrats ridiculed. At least one influential Republican had earlier indicated that it would be wrong for Republicans to move forward with a nominee next year after their blockade of Mr. Obama even if Republicans controlled both the White House and Senate. Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who was chairman of the Judiciary Committee in 2016 and stood with Mr. McConnell against considering any Obama nominee, said last October that if he were chairman, he would not consider a Trump nominee in 2020. \u201cIf I\u2019m chairman, they won\u2019t take it up,\u201d Mr. Grassley said in an October 2018 interview on Fox News. \u201cNo, because I pledged that in 2016.\u201d But he added, \u201cNow, if somebody else is the chairman of the committee, they\u2019ll have to decide for themselves.\u201d Well, somebody else is the chairman: Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and one of Mr. Trump\u2019s most outspoken allies. He has made it abundantly clear that he intends to be highly aggressive in pushing Trump nominees to the court. The most likely prospect for leaving the court voluntarily and creating an opening in the next two years would appear to be Clarence Thomas, 70, a justice since his bitter confirmation in 1991. Two of the other four conservatives \u2014 Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh and Justice Neil M. Gorsuch \u2014 just joined the court. The other two Republican appointees, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., are 64 and 69. A decision by Mr. Thomas or another conservative to step down in the next two years would not change the ideological bent of the court, but it would allow the president to install a much younger conservative who could serve for decades more. The four more liberal members of the court \u2014 Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 86; Stephen G. Breyer, 80; Sonia Sotomayor, 64, and Elena Kagan, 59, would seem unlikely to give up their seats voluntarily when Mr. Trump and Mr. McConnell could engineer their replacements and further entrench conservatives. A court fight during what is already anticipated to be a tumultuous Trump re-election campaign could energize both sides, and the temperature could be elevated even more by Democrats\u2019 anger over what they see as flagrant hypocrisy by Mr. McConnell. If Mr. McConnell forged ahead with a nominee in 2020, Democrats could do little to stop him. Rules changes since 2013 have eroded the power of the filibuster on nominations and left it strictly in the hands of the majority to push through nominees on the strength of 51 votes. The problem for Mr. McConnell, who controls a Senate split 53 to 47, would be if even a handful of Republicans embraced the view expressed by Mr. Grassley last year that it would be improper to proceed with a nomination in a presidential election year after their own treatment of Mr. Obama and Judge Garland. In concert with Democrats, they could conceivably halt a third Trump nominee. Such a divide among Republicans would probably be considered a surprise, given the hold Mr. Trump has on the party. What shouldn\u2019t be a surprise is the declaration by Mr. McConnell that he would proceed with a nominee in 2020 despite his actions in 2016.",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 The House on Thursday approved expansive election security legislation that would mandate the use of backup paper ballots and postelection vote audits to guard against potential foreign meddling, seeking to pressure Senator Mitch McConnell to lift his blockade of election legislation in the upper chamber. Timed to coincide with the July 4 holiday, the House bill, which passed 225 to 184, largely along party lines, is the first and most expansive in a blitz of new measures that House Democrats say they will pass to address vulnerabilities highlighted by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. His report concluded that  Russia had conducted \u201csweeping and systematic\u201d interference in the 2016 presidential election, and members of both parties fear that not enough is being done to prevent that from happening again next year. Other legislation could include a requirement that political campaigns report to the F.B.I. any offer of assistance from a foreign power, new sanctions to punish Russia and other foreign powers that interfere with the American democratic processes, and bipartisan mandates for social media platforms like Facebook to disclose the purchasers of political advertisements. But with the Senate in Republican hands, Democrats have another, more immediate target in mind: trying to shame Mr. McConnell, the majority leader, into dropping his opposition to proposals \u2014 even bipartisan ones \u2014 and allowing his chamber to consider measures to better protect the vote. House leaders excoriated Mr. McConnell on Thursday and have urged their colleagues to hold events promoting the legislative action as they scatter across the country during the weeklong holiday recess. \u201cUnfortunately, Senator McConnell, self-described crepe hanger, has vowed to kill our bill as the president declares he sees no problem with foreign intervention in our election,\u201d Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California said Thursday morning on the floor of the House. \u201cThe G.O.P. Senate and the White House are giving foreign countries the green light to attack our country. But the House will do our part to protect America.\u201d Mr. McConnell has showed little sign of budging. Colleagues say that he, like some other members of the Republican Party party, ideologically opposes the federal government wading further into election administration, which has traditionally been carried out by the states. And he has expressed confidence that a 2017 package of Russia sanctions and $380 million in grants Congress allocated to states last year, along with executive branch actions to step up deterrence and support state election authorities, have already set the country on the right path. In a brief interview on Thursday, Mr. McConnell called the House bill a \u201cnonstarter\u201d in the Senate. The bill, the Securing America\u2019s Federal Elections Act, would set new federal standards for vendors and operators of voting systems that most security experts argue will significantly limit the risk of foreign intrusions. In addition to authorizing $600 million for Election Assistance Commission grants to update voting technology, the bill would require states to use backup paper ballots that can be verified by voters and election counters, institute postelection audits to search for possible irregularities and prohibit voting systems from connecting to the internet. Many states have already adopted those changes, but experts who argue for federal assistance say not all local election authorities have the money, personnel or know-how to keep systems updated. The $380 million that Congress signed off on last year helped, they say, but it only began to address the need. \u201cThe states are not responding with the alacrity that this situation demands,\u201d said Susan Greenhalgh, a vice president for the National Election Defense Coalition, a nonpartisan group trying to unite the left and right around election security issues. \u201cIt is a national security crisis \u2014 nothing less \u2014 and that requires a federal response.\u201d In an interview, Ms. Greenhalgh praised the House bill but cautioned, \u201cWe don\u2019t pass one bill and call it a day and say our elections are secure now.\u201d Republicans in the House echoed parts of Mr. McConnell\u2019s argument on Thursday, calling the House vote unnecessarily rushed and accusing Democrats of ramming through a partisan bill when their party was willing to back a range of more limited proposals. \u201cWhat we are debating here today will put more unfunded and underfunded mandates onto states like Illinois,\u201d said Representative Rodney Davis of Illinois, the top Republican on the House panel responsible for the bill. \u201cThat is not what local election officials in my state asked for.\u201d White House officials convened a briefing with senior law enforcement and intelligence officials this week to tout actions being taken without Congress\u2019s prodding hand. They stressed that the executive branch was already preparing for attempts by Russia, China, Iran and other foreign actors to try to tamper with the American political process. One senior administration official, who spoke anonymously at the White House\u2019s direction, said that officials from agencies responsible for fending off foreign intrusions had already briefed every presidential campaign on the threat to the 2020 elections and the federal resources available to them. Mr. McConnell\u2019s critics have taken a more cynical view, though, arguing that he is simply afraid of stirring the ire of President Trump, who views talk of Russia\u2019s election interference as tantamount to questioning the legitimacy of his election. The House has already passed many of the provisions in Thursday\u2019s bill in an omnibus \u201cgood governance\u201d package. But Mr. McConnell has ridiculed that bill as an attempt by Democrats to strengthen their own campaigns, so Democrats chose to break the election security measures off into a single bill. Their efforts have gotten a boost not only from the attention brought by Mr. Mueller, but also from Mr. Trump, whose comments in recent weeks that he would be open to accepting foreign assistance without necessarily telling the F.B.I. ignited a political firestorm. In the Senate, Democrats pushing Mr. McConnell to act have tried to be crafty \u2014 but so far have had little success. This week, they proposed a series of amendments to the annual must-pass defense policy bill that would have included many of the same provisions getting votes in the House. Mr. McConnell blunted that effort, though, by limiting the amendment process on the defense bill. But a defense policy bill, which was approved Thursday by the Senate, did contain some additional provisions to aid law enforcement and intelligence agencies responsible for detecting and deterring foreign threats. They included the creation of an independent Social Media Data Analysis Center meant to ease information sharing on foreign influence campaigns, like Russia\u2019s, between private companies and the government. It also would codify changes adopted since 2016 within American intelligence agencies designed to streamline the federal response, better study the Russian threat and keep Congress better informed. The Senate\u2019s defense bill and its intelligence provisions will still have to be reconciled with House versions before becoming law. Democrats who want money for state election infrastructure are also eyeing the annual appropriations process, where they believe they have more leverage to at least allocate additional funds.",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Senator Mitch McConnell is usually impervious to criticism, even celebrating the nasty nicknames critics bestow on him. But Mr. McConnell, the Senate majority leader, is incensed by the name \u201cMoscow Mitch,\u201d and even more miffed that he has been called a \u201cRussian asset\u201d by critics who accuse him of single-handedly blocking stronger election security measures after Russia\u2019s interference in 2016. Democrats had been making the case for months, but it was supercharged last week by the testimony of Robert S. Mueller III, the former special counsel, who told the House Intelligence Committee that the Russians were back at it \u201cas we sit here.\u201d Mr. McConnell cites several reasons for his opposition \u2014 a longstanding resistance to federal control over state elections, newly enacted security improvements that were shown to have worked in the 2018 voting and his suspicion that Democrats are trying to gain partisan advantage with a host of proposals. Republican colleagues say that Mr. McConnell, a longtime foe of tougher campaign finance restrictions and disclosure requirements, is leery of even entering into legislative negotiation that could touch on fund-raising and campaign spending. But whatever Mr. McConnell\u2019s reasoning, the criticism has taken hold \u2014 even back home in Kentucky, where the majority leader faces re-election next year. \u201cDemocrats want more aggressive legislation to protect America\u2019s elections after Robert Mueller\u2019s stark warning about Russian interference,\u201d began one report aired on a Louisville television station last week. \u201cMitch McConnell blocked it.\u201d Even President Trump felt compelled to come to his defense \u2014 as only he could. \u201cMitch McConnell is a man that knows less about Russia and Russian influence than even Donald Trump,\u201d the president told reporters Tuesday as he was leaving for a speech in Jamestown, Va. \u201cAnd I know nothing.\u201d That did not relieve the heat on the majority leader, who on Monday had appeared to open the door ever so slightly to doing more on election preparedness. \u201cI\u2019m sure all of us will be open to discussing further steps Congress, the executive branch, the states and the private sector might take to defend our elections against foreign interference,\u201d he said as he seethed on the Senate floor over what he described as McCarthy-style attacks on his integrity and distortions of both his position on election security and his hawkish history of challenging Russia. Throughout his political career, Mr. McConnell has made opposition to the Kremlin a hallmark of his foreign policy stands. For once, Democrats seemed to be getting to a man who has embraced his portrayal as Darth Vader and the Grim Reaper overseeing a Senate graveyard for legislation that he opposes. When an unsubstantiated West Virginia Senate campaign ad in 2018 called him \u201cCocaine Mitch,\u201d he began answering his Senate telephone with that identifier. \u201cMoscow Mitch\u201d? Not so much: \u201cI was called unpatriotic, un-American and essentially treasonous,\u201d he fumed on the Senate floor. Democrats pressed their advantage. And why not? The hashtag #MoscowMitchMcTraitor was trending on Twitter, and Senate Republicans of all stripes were being asked about the blockade. \u201cSo long as the Senate Republicans prevent legislation from reaching the floor, so long as they oppose additional appropriations to the states, so long as they malign election security provisions as, quote, partisan wish lists, the critics are right to say Leader McConnell and Republican senators are blocking election security,\u201d Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said on the floor Tuesday. Mr. Schumer has in the past suggested that another potential reason behind Mr. McConnell\u2019s position is the thought that interference emanating from Russia could aid Republicans. \u201cI hope it\u2019s not because he thinks it will benefit him, because Putin could turn around in a minute, and then do things that he doesn\u2019t like,\u201d Mr. Schumer said in June. Lawmakers in both parties have election security proposals waiting on the sidelines, and the furor has caused some to step up demands for Congress to take up their bills. Senators Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, and Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland, wrote on Monday to colleagues reconciling the annual House and Senate military policy bill to request that they include stalled sanctions legislation meant to deter Russia or other foreign actors from interfering in American elections. House lawmakers included a similar provision in their military policy bill, but the senators want to see it strengthened to slap Russia\u2019s economy with intense sanctions if it is found to interfere in a future election. \u201cThis conference committee represents this Congress\u2019 best \u2014 potentially last \u2014 opportunity to enact meaningful legislation aimed at deterring Russia from a repeat performance of its 2016 presidential election interference,\u201d the senators wrote. \u201cWe ask that you seize this opportunity and include the provisions outlined above in the final conference report.\u201d On Tuesday, Senator Susan Collins of Maine, a Republican member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, signed on to a measure by Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the committee\u2019s top Democrat, that would require campaign officials to report to federal authorities any offers of campaign assistance from foreign entities. \u201cRussia\u2019s efforts to interfere in our elections remain relentless,\u201d said Ms. Collins, who is also up for re-election next year, in a statement. Mr. McConnell\u2019s opposition to any and all election legislation has bottled up the bills in the Senate Rules Committee. The panel\u2019s chairman, Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri, has hesitated to advance any of the measures since they would go nowhere on the floor. Mr. Blunt said he repeatedly had been assured by the F.B.I., the Department of Homeland Security and the federal intelligence agencies that they were not lacking resources to combat election interference. \u201cThey always say, \u2018No, we don\u2019t need anything,\u2019\u201d Mr. Blunt said Tuesday. A former state elections official himself, Mr. Blunt said he agreed with Mr. McConnell that the federal government should not gain more authority over state elections. \u201cMitch would not want to see us further federalize the process and that\u2019s where I am, too,\u201d Mr. Blunt said. Proponents of the bills say they are devised to keep the states in the lead. A Democratic measure approved by the House would send more than $1 billion to state and local governments to tighten election security, but would also demand that states use the money for machines with backup paper ballots and require a national strategy to protect American democratic institutions against cyberattacks. States would be required to spend federal funds only on federally certified \u201celection infrastructure vendors.\u201d A bipartisan measure in both chambers would require internet companies like Facebook to disclose the purchasers of political ads. Another bipartisan Senate proposal would codify cyberinformation-sharing initiatives between federal intelligence services and state election officials, speed up the granting of security clearances to state officials and provide federal incentives for states to adopt backup paper ballots. Backup paper ballots got an endorsement Tuesday from an unlikely source: Mr. Trump. He took to Twitter to call for \u201cPaper Ballots as backup (old fashioned but true!).\u201d With the focus on the issue intensifying, Mr. McConnell and Senate Republicans will face more pressure to act. If they do, the most likely result would not be advancing stand-alone bills but instead using the annual spending bills that must pass this fall to funnel more money to states to secure their elections and to make certain they have a paper-ballot trail that can be audited if questions arise about the legitimacy of an outcome. Ten states now lack full capacity to do so, according to the Rules Committee. Mr. Schumer encouraged that idea Tuesday. \u201cIf McConnell wants to address election security in the appropriations process, we would welcome his support on an amendment to send more funding to the states,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to get something done on election security because this is not about party, this is a matter of national security. Mr. McConnell said Monday that he would not be intimidated into acting on election interference. He also will probably not be answering his phone \u201cMoscow Mitch.\u201d",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Amy McGrath, a retired Marine lieutenant colonel and combat pilot whose star power in the Democratic Party in 2018 failed to capture her a House seat in Kentucky, announced Tuesday that she would seek to challenge Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader, in 2020. Ms. McGrath, 44, made her intentions known with a dark video denouncing Mr. McConnell, 77, who was first elected to the Senate in 1984 and has served as the central ballast for President Trump in Washington. [Update: Amy McGrath raises $2.5 million in 24 hours.] \u201cEverything that\u2019s wrong in Washington had to start someplace,\u201d Ms. McGrath said in the video. \u201cIt started with this man who was elected a lifetime ago, and who has, bit by bit, year by year, turned Washington into something we all despise.\u201d She also reprised a story she used in her 2018 campaign against Representative Andy Barr, recounting that as a young woman she wrote to Mr. McConnell \u201ctelling him I wanted to fly fighter jets in combat, to fight for my country, and that women should be able to do that,\u201d and noting that he never wrote back. [Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter.] \u201cThe same reasons I decided to run in 2018 are still there,\u201d Ms. McGrath said in an interview Tuesday afternoon. \u201cMy childhood dream was never to be a politician,\u201d she said, but she and her husband \u201ckind of looked at each other said we need better leaders in this country.\u201d Mr. McConnell is in some ways as loathed by Democrats as Mr. Trump. And he has arguably been more effective, maintaining a stronghold over the nation\u2019s judiciary and largely refusing to cooperate with Democrats on major legislation. In light of that, Ms. McGrath has adopted an unusual strategy for a Democrat: She is blaming Mr. McConnell for blocking legislation and cultural changes in Washington sought by Mr. Trump. \u201cKentuckians voted for Donald Trump because they wanted to drain the swamp and lower prescription drug prices,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of what has stood in the way of what Donald Trump promised is Senator McConnell.\u201d Mr. Trump commented on Ms. McGrath\u2019s entry into the race Tuesday evening, writing on Twitter, \u201cWhy would Kentucky ever think of giving up the most powerful position in Congress, the Senate Majority Leader, for a freshman Senator with little power in what will hopefully be the minority party.\u201d Mr. McConnell\u2019s re-election team had been anticipating Ms. McGrath\u2019s announcement for months. On Tuesday, he responded with his own video that highlighted her support for priorities like abortion rights and a single-payer health care system \u2014 positions Mr. McConnell believes will be unpopular in Kentucky. \u201cAmy McGrath lost her only race in a Democratic wave election because she is an extreme liberal who is far out of touch with Kentuckians,\u201d Kevin Golden, Mr. McConnell\u2019s campaign manager, said in a statement. He said Ms. McGrath would have \u201ca heckuva platform that we will be delighted to discuss over the next 16 months.\u201d Ms. McGrath\u2019s decision to take on Mr. McConnell in a state that is generally not propitious for Democrats reflects the party\u2019s enduring faith in military veterans, whose career paths and inspiring back stories can help blunt associations with its more liberal proclivities, and who also tend to be fund-raising juggernauts. In the first three months of 2019, among the 28 freshman House Democrats who raised more than $400,000, several were veterans, including Representative Max Rose, Democrat of New York, who raised a head-turning $800,000. When asked if her race would be expensive, Ms. McGrath said, somewhat forlornly, \u201cI imagine it will.\u201d But she added: \u201cNinety percent of my donations in the last race were $50 or less. The vet who is handing me $20 is not handing me draft legislation along with it.\u201d But no matter how much money Ms. McGrath may raise from Democrats across the country eager to dispatch Mr. McConnell, she will still face a formidable challenge. Mr. McConnell, Kentucky\u2019s longest serving senator, is \u201cone of the most powerful political machines that\u2019s ever existed,\u201d said Jon Soltz, an Iraq War veteran and co-founder of VoteVets.org, a liberal political action committee that supports veterans running for office. \u201cIt takes someone with a compelling, nonpolitical profile to break through that,\u201d Mr. Soltz said. \u201cWhen you talk about Amy McGrath, you\u2019re talking about someone who has the credibility, with her profile, to reach people outside the Democratic base, independents, even Republicans. That\u2019s what will break the McConnell machine.\u201d Among the 67 new Democrats in Congress, 10 served in the military or intelligence agencies and were instrumental in returning control of the House to Democrats. The group has formed a tight bond in the 116th Congress. Many of those members, especially the women, campaigned with Ms. McGrath and are eager to see her run. \u201cI\u2019m excited to support my friend Amy McGrath,\u201d said Representative Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, a former Central Intelligence Agency operations officer who last year eked out a victory against a Republican incumbent. \u201cHer race to defeat Senate majority leader McConnell should matter to any American, regardless of party, who wants to see us get stuff done in Washington for the American people.\u201d Other candidates may file to run as Democrats in Kentucky next year, but Ms. McGrath is the only prominent potential nominee. She put up a stronger fight against Mr. Barr than he had faced in recent elections, losing by about three percentage points. And there are certainly no givens in American politics, especially for incumbents like Mr. McConnell who are associated with Washington\u2019s enduring dysfunction. Still, Kentucky remains tough terrain for Democrats, and may be more so with Mr. Trump, who remains largely popular in the state, at the top of the ticket. In 2014, Alison Lundergan Grimes, a Democrat who hoped to capitalize on Mr. McConnell\u2019s lack of popularity nationwide, failed to topple him, winning just nine out of 120 counties. Ms. McGrath said she had learned a great deal from her unsuccessful House campaign. \u201cThis is a different race,\u201d she said. \u201cFolks don\u2019t always win the first time they run.\u201d",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Seven months into a new era of divided government, the Republican-led Senate limped out of Washington this week after the fewest legislative debates of any in recent memory, without floor votes on issues that both parties view as urgent: the high cost of prescription drugs, a broken immigration system and crumbling infrastructure. The number of Senate roll call votes on amendments \u2014 a key indicator of whether lawmakers are engaged in free and open debate \u2014 plummeted to only 18 this year, according to a review of congressional data. During the same time period in the 10 previous Congresses, senators took anywhere from 34 to 231 amendment votes. The inaction stands in stark contrast to the promises of Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader. After his party took control of the Senate in 2015, Mr. McConnell vowed to end the gridlock that had gripped the chamber under his Democratic predecessor, Harry Reid, and pledged to allow both parties to offer amendments to legislation \u2014 even if it forced Republicans to risk taking politically unpopular votes. \u201cWe\u2019ll just take our chances,\u201d he said at a news conference in early 2016. \u201cYou know, we\u2019re big men and women. We\u2019re prepared to vote on proposals that are offered from both sides.\u201d Instead, the Senate, once known as \u201cthe world\u2019s greatest deliberative body,\u201d is operating exactly as Mr. McConnell now wants it to: as an approval factory for President Trump\u2019s judicial and administration nominees. In his effort to remake the courts, Mr. McConnell is succeeding; so far this year, the Senate has confirmed 13 circuit court nominees, for a total of 43 since Mr. Trump took office in 2017, and 46 of his district court nominees, for a total of 99. By contrast, during the last two years of President Barack Obama\u2019s administration, with Republicans running the Senate, only 22 judicial nominees were confirmed. Dysfunction in Washington, of course, is nothing new, and it is especially pronounced when the House and Senate are controlled by opposing parties. This year has been worse than most. It started off with a government shutdown that did not get resolved until three weeks into the new Congress. In an analysis of the first six months of the new Congress, the Bipartisan Policy Center found fault with leaders in both parties for \u201cnot engaging in the kind of deliberation and debate that is necessary to develop quality bills.\u201d The Senate\u2019s legislative achievements have been confined largely to noncontroversial bipartisan measures \u2014 including a land conservation package and a bill cracking down on illegal telemarketing \u2014 and must-pass bills, including disaster relief and emergency aid for the border; an annual military policy measure; and  a two-year budget deal lawmakers approved just before they left. But the budget deal, the product of negotiations between Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, passed over the objections of roughly half the Senate Republicans. Lawmakers had little say in its content, and Mr. McConnell permitted debate on just one amendment, offered by Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, that would have cut spending and required a balanced budget. \u201cThe Senate was supposed to be the great deliberative body,\u201d said G. William Hoagland, the senior vice president of the Bipartisan Policy Center and a one-time adviser to Bill Frist, the former Republican leader. \u201cYou offered the amendments, and you debated the amendments and you actually had a debate. I got more out of last night\u2019s Democratic debate on some policy issues than I\u2019ve gotten the last few months out of the Senate.\u201d Mr. McConnell declined to be interviewed. But in a speech on the Senate floor in recent days, he blamed Democrats for creating delays and clogging up the Senate calendar by insisting on so-called cloture votes \u2014 procedural votes that determine whether to cut off debate and proceed to a final vote \u2014 for most nominations. Senator John Thune, the No 2. Republican, echoed that point when asked if he was surprised that so little legislation of consequence had passed. \u201cI was not surprised by it,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cObviously we\u2019ve been busy with the personnel business of the Senate, which is a very time-consuming task \u2014 especially with the Democrats forcing cloture votes on every judge or other nominee we bring up.\u201d In the foreign policy arena, the Senate defied the president by voting to end American military assistance for the Saudi-backed war in Yemen and to block Mr. Trump\u2019s emergency declaration at the southwestern border. It passed a Middle East policy bill that rebuked Mr. Trump for withdrawing troops from Syria and Afghanistan and included a provision aimed at undermining the boycott Israel movement. But it rejected a bipartisan measure that would have required Mr. Trump to get permission from Congress before striking Iran. But the Senate\u2019s legislative record on domestic issues has been so thin that a number of Republicans were left grasping for words when asked to name the chamber\u2019s most significant legislative achievement this year. \u201cDid we pass the opioid legislation this year, or was that last year?\u201d Senator Shelley Moore Capito, Republican of West Virginia, asked her aide, who informed her that the bipartisan measure to address the opioid epidemic had passed in 2018. Ms. Capito paused, and a long silence ensued. \u201cCriminal justice reform!\u201d declared Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa. But the bill overhauling sentencing laws, which Mr. Grassley championed, passed at the end of the last Congress, he was told. Mr. Grassley waved his hand. \u201cClose enough,\u201d he said. Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, put it this way: \u201cWe\u2019re at a complete standstill on the big stuff.\u201d Senate committees, though, have been working. The Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions  approved a package of bills in June aimed at lowering the cost of medical care and prescription drugs, and the Senate Finance Committee has also passed a measure to lower prescription drug prices. Both are bipartisan efforts, and Mr. Thune said he expected votes on health care in the fall. The Environment and Public Works Committee unanimously approved a bipartisan highway bill this week, though Mr. Thune said he believed an infrastructure package would be \u201ca heavy lift,\u201d because the parties disagree on how to pay for it. Also this week, Mr. Graham, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, pushed through an immigration measure that would extend family detentions, over the vociferous objections of committee Democrats. The House, with a Democratic majority under the leadership of Ms. Pelosi, left for recess a week earlier than the Senate with a long list of symbolic victories but few substantive ones, in part because the bills have passed almost universally along party lines. Mr. McConnell, who has cast himself as \u201cthe grim reaper\u201d for progressive policies, has refused to take them up. Democrats have seized on that refusal, accusing Mr. McConnell of turning the Senate into a \u201clegislative graveyard\u201d \u2014 a phrase Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, invoked in recent days when he complained to reporters about the state of affairs in the chamber, including Mr. McConnell\u2019s recent decision to block legislation aimed at improving the security of elections. \u201cFrom health care to gun safety to climate change, Republicans just say no, despite the overwhelming consensus of the American people on these issues,\u201d Mr. Schumer said, adding: \u201cLeader McConnell\u2019s Senate has been a big black hole. There has not been a single bill open for amendment all year. Not. One. Bill.\u201d Some Republicans say they do not blame Mr. McConnell. \u201cThere are certain issues that the ideological divide is so great I think that if I were Mitch, I wouldn\u2019t bring something up on the floor that would be anything more than a big debate club with no outcome,\u201d said Senator Thom Tillis, Republican of North Carolina. Floor time, he said, is the Senate\u2019s \u201ccoin of the realm,\u201d and it makes far more sense to allocate it toward judicial nominations and consensus bipartisan measures. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in divided government like we are now,\u201d he said, \u201cyou\u2019ve got to set aside your more contentious issues.\u201d But other rank-and-file Republicans are grousing, including many freshmen who have had to curb their ambitions. Senator Josh Hawley, a freshman Republican from Missouri, arrived in Washington hoping to address the high cost of prescription drugs. Instead, he will report to constituents that he is the first freshman to have a bill signed into law: a bipartisan measure that restores grant funding to establish suicide-prevention programs and mental health services for police officers. \u201cI promised the people of Missouri when I ran for this job that I would not be a wall flower, I would not just sit back, and I would not go along with the status quo, that I would actually speak up for the issues that matter to our families, working families, parents, children,\u201d Mr. Hawley said proudly. He was asked if he is frustrated. \u201cOh, yeah!\u201d Mr. Hawley exclaimed. \u201cIt\u2019s totally dysfunctional.\u201d",

Six top Democrats called on Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, to bring senators back to Washington to pass two House bills: one mandating background checks on all gun purchases, including at gun shows and on the internet, and another extending the time the F.B.I. has to complete background checks. \u201cThe time is not simply for reflection,\u201d said Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the Democratic leader. \u201cThe time is not for a moment of silence. The time for the Senate is to act. The time is to listen to the American people.\u201d [Read more about mass shootings in 2019.] Returning to Washington from their districts, the lawmakers shared stories from their constituents demanding action. Representative Debbie Dingell of Michigan, whose husband, John, was on the board of the National Rifle Association before his death in February, described attending a festival in her hometown in the days after mass shootings in Ohio and Texas. She said an Arab-American child approached her and asked, \u201cWhy do people hate us? Are we safe?\u201d \u201cI shouldn\u2019t be answering questions of mothers of kindergartners or of children themselves about whether they are safe or hated,\u201d Ms. Dingell said, her voice rising. \u201cWe can\u2019t keep going to our corners and not figuring out what we are going to do.\u201d On the other side of the Capitol, Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, has also been pressing Mr. McConnell to take up the House legislation and intends to formally request that the Trump administration cancel its request for $5 billion in border wall funding and reallocate the money for other uses, including initiatives to address gun violence and violent white supremacy, according to a senior aide to Mr. Schumer. Gun safety has long been one of the most divisive issues in Washington, but this month\u2019s massacres in El Paso and Dayton, Ohio, have thrust it onto the congressional agenda in a way not seen since 2012, after the massacre of 26 children and staff members at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. Congress failed to take action in the wake of that tragedy; a bipartisan background check bill fell in the Senate in 2013. The House, now under Democratic control, passed a background check bill earlier this year, along with a bill extending the time the F.B.I. has to conduct background checks to 10 business days from three. But Mr. McConnell had refused to take up the measures because President Trump threatened to veto them. But while Mr. Trump has said repeatedly that Mr. McConnell favors expanding background checks, the leader has not committed to taking up the bill, and he has said he has no intention of bringing the Senate back early to consider it. Mr. Trump on Sunday telephoned Senator Christopher S. Murphy, a Democrat who has been one of the leading voices in Congress for gun control, an indication that the president is interested in pursuing legislation. Earlier in the week, Mr. Murphy had contacted the White House to indicate that he was willing to work with Mr. Trump on the issue, which prompted the call. The conversation was positive, with Mr. Trump indicating that he was serious about persuading Republicans to act, according to officials familiar with their discussion. And the two agreed to set up a staff-level dialogue this week between their offices and those of Senators Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, and Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, who are working feverishly to revive the background check legislation they wrote after the Sandy Hook massacre. The N.R.A., which opposes gun registration in any form, has for years fought against background check bills, arguing that they \u201cdon\u2019t stop criminals from getting firearms\u201d and that some proposals \u201cwould deprive individuals of due process of law.\u201d If such a bill passed and was signed by Mr. Trump into law, it would be the first significant federal gun safety law in a quarter-century. Tuesday\u2019s news conference comes as Democrats, including those on the presidential campaign trail, are rushing to embrace gun safety legislation and make it a campaign issue. Gun safety was a major topic of conversation at the Iowa State Fair over the weekend, which turned into a kind of contest to determine which Democrats could advance the most aggressive gun control measures. And while House Democratic leaders are pushing for the background check bill, many Democrats are seeking to revive the assault weapons ban, which expired in 2004 and had barred the purchase of military-style semiautomatic assault rifles and high-capacity magazines like the gunman used in Dayton. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. called for an assault weapons ban in an opinion piece in The New York Times on Monday. On Tuesday, his campaign sent an email to supporters asking them to sign a petition asking Congress to reinstate the ban and said it already had 18,000 signatures. The ban, though, is a nonstarter in the Senate, and even its chief sponsor, Representative David Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island, said Monday in an interview that the better strategy was to pressure Mr. McConnell to take action on the bills the House had already passed. \u201cWe passed two pieces of legislation that will make a real difference, that are overwhelmingly supported by the American people,\u201d said Mr. Cicilline, who is also a member of Democratic leadership. \u201cI think the sense is: Let\u2019s push hard to get the Senate to come into session or at least act on the two bills that we\u2019ve already sent them. And then we can take up other ideas.\u201d Polls show that roughly 90 percent of the public supports expanded background checks, but Democrats were for years skittish about pursuing gun safety legislation. With more and more mass shootings, that has begun to change. \u201cThe biggest thing that has changed is a cultural shift with all of these shootings,\u201d said Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster. \u201cWhen the mayor of Dayton said something like they were the 250th city to have a mass shooting this year, when you have all of the people that have been killed \u2014 and not just in mass shootings, every day on the streets \u2014 I think there is just a whole different momentum for doing something.\u201d The political landscape is changing as well. Last year, two Democrats \u2014 Representatives Jason Crow of Colorado and Lucy McBath of Georgia \u2014 flipped Republican seats in swing districts after campaigning on a promise to fight gun violence. Mr. Crow is a military veteran. Ms. McBath\u2019s 17-year-old son, Jordan Davis, was shot and killed seven years ago at a Florida gas station by a white man who complained that Jordan and his friends were playing music too loudly in their car. \u201cIt\u2019s a false choice between the Second Amendment and responsible regulation and prevention,\u201d Mr. Crow said in an interview. \u201cI come at this from my frame as a lifetime hunter and a gun owner. It\u2019s a false choice, it\u2019s one that we now reject. We can respect the cultural heritage of responsible gun ownership in America but also save thousands of lives.\u201d",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 For two decades, through Columbine, Virginia Tech, Newtown, Orlando, Las Vegas and the rest, mass shootings have provoked only scant action in Congress. Now, after horrific back-to-back massacres this weekend, people in both parties agree that one man could change that: Senator Mitch McConnell. As President Trump urged national unity in the face of \u201cracist hate\u201d without endorsing broad gun control measures, Democrats and a handful of Republicans called on Monday for Mr. McConnell, the majority leader, to bring up legislation to require gun buyers \u2014 including those on the internet and at gun shows \u2014 to go through background checks. Mr. McConnell, nursing a fractured shoulder from a weekend fall at home in Kentucky, made no commitments. After consulting with advisers and fellow Republicans, he issued a statement Monday evening saying that he had asked three top committee chairmen \u201cto engage in bipartisan discussions\u201d about how to address gun violence \u201cwithout infringing on Americans\u2019 constitutional rights.\u201d \u201cSenate Republicans are prepared to do our part,\u201d he said. But just what \u201cour part\u201d is, was unclear. One of Mr. McConnell\u2019s longtime advisers, J. Scott Jennings, said Monday that Mr. McConnell was positioned to lead a process in Congress that could \u201cachieve a solution that, at a minimum, comforts the nation.\u201d \u201cPeople want something to happen,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think people want mass confiscation of guns, but they do want something to show responsiveness.\u201d With Congress in recess, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, demanded that Mr. McConnell bring back the Senate \u2014 something he is highly unlikely to do \u2014 to consider a House background checks bill, which passed in February. While some House Democrats want Ms. Pelosi to call back the House to consider additional legislation, such as an assault weapons ban, Democratic leaders want to keep the pressure on Mr. Trump and Mr. McConnell. After a conference call with House Democrats on Monday, Ms. Pelosi sent them a \u201cDear Colleague\u201d letter saying two committees would hold hearings on domestic terrorism and gun violence. \u201cThe president and Mitch McConnell have to feel the public sentiment on this,\u201d Ms. Pelosi told Democrats during the call, according to an aide. \u201cWe have a golden opportunity to save lives.\u201d In the Senate, some of Mr. McConnell\u2019s Republican colleagues were speaking up. Senator Susan Collins of Maine, who faces a tough re-election race next year if she runs again, said she had \u201clong supported closing loopholes in background checks.\u201d Senator Mike Braun, a freshman from Indiana, said any bipartisan legislation to address gun violence must include stronger background checks and \u201cred flag\u201d laws, which were cited by Mr. Trump and would allow the temporary confiscation of firearms from people deemed a danger to themselves or others. Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, one of the committee chairmen called into action by the majority leader, vowed, \u201cI am ready to do more, especially on background checks, to identify those who shouldn\u2019t have guns.\u201d And Senator Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania convened a conference call with reporters to announce that he was reviving his background check measure, which failed in the Senate in 2013. He said he spoke Monday morning to Mr. Trump, who expressed \u201ca very constructive willingness to engage on this issue,\u201d and also to Mr. McConnell, whose comments he would not characterize. \u201cMy view is, if we have enough support in the Senate, then we ought to have a vote, and I intend to do everything I can to persuade Senator McConnell if that\u2019s necessary,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to me that we get that vote.\u201d At 77, Mr. McConnell, who is running for re-election in 2020, has cast himself as the \u201cgrim reaper\u201d for liberal legislation. Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Schumer have repeatedly called the Senate a \u201clegislative graveyard,\u201d and around the country, Mr. McConnell has become a target for liberals \u2014 as reviled by the left as Ms. Pelosi is on the right. On Monday, he was being pilloried on social media with the hashtag #MassacreMitch \u2014 a twist on #MoscowMitch, the moniker that critics used to assail him for blocking election security legislation. His campaign came under attack on two fronts. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York, demanded an explanation for a photograph that appeared on Twitter of young men wearing \u201cTeam Mitch\u201d T-shirts appearing to choke a life-size cardboard cutout of her. And Amy McGrath, Mr. McConnell\u2019s likely Democratic opponent, complained that the campaign had tweeted a photograph of a mock graveyard depicting tombstones with her name and the name of Merrick B. Garland, whose Supreme Court nomination Mr. McConnell blocked. The McConnell campaign said it did not produce the gravestones, which were photographed at Fancy Farm, a Kentucky political picnic, as a spoof of a newspaper cartoon that Ms. McGrath herself had circulated. But Ms. McGrath upbraided the campaign for \u201cnasty and personal\u201d attacks \u2014 a message that was picked up by Gabrielle Giffords, the former congresswoman who was grievously wounded in a mass shooting in Tucson in 2011, and is now an advocate for gun safety laws. \u201cI am appalled that in this divisive political climate \u2014 a climate where gun violence fueled by hate is on the rise \u2014 Mitch McConnell is joking about the death of his current and former opponents and a federal judge,\u201d Ms. Giffords said in a statement. \u201cThe nation is turning to Leader McConnell right now for leadership, and this is the furthest thing from it.\u201d Gun violence \u2014 and how to address it \u2014 has been one of the most intractable and divisive issues in Washington; the last time the lawmakers voted to restrict gun ownership was 1994, when Congress passed an assault weapons ban. Even gun control advocates acknowledge that this weekend\u2019s mass shootings in Texas and Ohio are unlikely to produce quick congressional action. Still, some Republican strategists say they sense a shift in sentiment in their party. \u201cThere clearly seems to be a consensus developing on both sides of the aisle for universal mandatory background checks,\u201d said Whit Ayres, a Republican strategist. \u201cAnd the door may be opening a bit more for a ban on military-style assault weapons and magazines.\u201d With the National Rifle Association, the nation\u2019s most powerful gun lobby, in disarray amid a string of lawsuits and internal upheaval, some Republicans who favor tightening gun laws say now is the time to act. But Mr. McConnell, who wants to maintain the Republican majority in the Senate, is well aware that voters in rural hunting states \u2014 including his own \u2014 would not look kindly on any restrictions on gun rights. Al Cross, the director of the Institute for Rural Journalism and Community Issues at the University of Kentucky, said Mr. McConnell was unlikely to push for them. \u201cSix words,\u201d Mr. Cross declared. \u201cWe love our guns in Kentucky.\u201d And Mr. McConnell is unlikely to act without the approval of Mr. Trump, whose own statements on gun violence have been all over the place. In an early morning tweet on Monday, Mr. Trump called for \u201cstrong background checks,\u201d but tied them to an immigration law overhaul. In a speech from the White House a few hours later, he did not mention background checks, but instead called for red flag laws. Conservatives quickly seized on the idea. Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and a close ally of Mr. Trump, said after the speech that he and Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, had agreed on a plan to use federal grants to help states enact red flag laws. He said he had spoken with the president about the proposal, \u201cand he seems very supportive.\u201d",

      "content": " Senators Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul, Republicans of Kentucky, are recovering at home from medical procedures they had over the weekend, their teams said. Mr. McConnell, the majority leader, fractured his shoulder at his home in Louisville, while Mr. Paul underwent surgery to remove a portion of his lung. \u201cThis morning, Leader McConnell tripped at home on his outside patio and suffered a fractured shoulder,\u201d his spokesman, David Popp, said in a statement on Sunday. \u201cHe has been treated, released, and is working from home in Louisville.\u201d According to the statement, Mr. McConnell had been in contact with Senator John Cornyn of Texas and Senator Rob Portman of Ohio to \u201cexpress his deepest sympathies for the people of El Paso and Dayton\u201d and to discuss the \u201ctragedies.\u201d Two mass shootings erupted over the weekend in Texas and Ohio less than 24 hours apart, leaving 31 dead and dozens wounded. Mr. McConnell will \u201ccontinue to work from home,\u201d the statement said. It was unclear exactly what treatment Mr. McConnell, 77, had received for his shoulder. Mr. Paul, 56, announced on Monday that he had surgery over the weekend to remove part of his lung that he said was damaged in a 2017 attack when a neighbor tackled him as he did yardwork. \u201cUnfortunately, I will have to limit my August activities,\u201d Mr. Paul said on Twitter. \u201cI should be able to return to the Senate in September.\u201d He is recovering at home in Bowling Green, a representative said. In January, Mr. Paul was awarded $580,000 in damages in a lawsuit he filed against the neighbor, Rene A. Boucher, who pleaded guilty to felony assault last year. In the attack, Mr. Paul suffered broken ribs and came down with pneumonia, which kept him out of Washington for almost two weeks. The Republicans\u2019 injuries come as Democrats and some Republicans called for Mr. McConnell to bring up legislation to force gun buyers to go through background checks. For his part, Mr. McConnell issued a statement Monday night saying that he had asked three top committee chairmen \u201cto engage in bipartisan discussions\u201d about how to address gun violence \u201cwithout infringing on Americans\u2019 constitutional rights.\u201d \u201cSenate Republicans are prepared to do our part,\u201d he said, without specifics. With Congress in recess, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, demanded that Mr. McConnell bring back the Senate \u2014 something he is highly unlikely to do \u2014 to consider a House background checks bill, which passed in February. Mr. McConnell is unlikely to act without the approval of President Trump, whose own statements on gun violence have varied. On Monday during a televised address, Mr. Trump stopped well short of supporting the kind of broad gun control measures that activists and Democrats have sought. He instead opted to highlight longtime Republican alternatives, such as stronger action to address mental illness, violence in the media and in video games, as well as \u201cthe perils of the internet and social media,\u201d without acknowledging his own use of those platforms to promote his own brand of divisive politics. He did not reiterate his earlier request on Twitter for a bipartisan effort to strengthen background checks for prospective gun buyers. Last week, the Senate ended a session without floor votes on key issues like the high cost of prescription drugs, immigration and infrastructure. Mr. McConnell had previously promised to end gridlock in the Senate. Mr. McConnell, however, has been successful this year in getting the Senate to approve several of Mr. Trump\u2019s judicial and administration nominees. The Senate has confirmed 13 circuit court nominees and 46 of his district court nominees.",

      "content": " Senator Mitch McConnell\u2019s re-election campaign regained access to its Twitter account on Friday, days after getting locked out for posting a tweet that Twitter had flagged as inappropriate. The tweet, which the campaign sent Tuesday out of its @Team_Mitch account, included a video of people making violent threats against the majority leader in front of his Louisville, Ky., home. In text accompanying the video, the campaign labeled the protesters as an \u201cangry left-wing mob.\u201d Twitter hid the tweet and locked the campaign out of the account on the basis that the tweet \u2014 with the video embedded \u2014 contained a threat and had violated the platform\u2019s \u201cabusive behavior policy.\u201d That left Mr. McConnell\u2019s team in the unusual position of being locked out of its account for posting a video of a threat that had been made against Mr. McConnell. The campaign appealed largely on those grounds, arguing that its intent had been \u201cto highlight the threats for public discussion,\u201d Twitter said in a statement on Friday. \u201cWe have reviewed this case more closely,\u201d the Twitter statement said. \u201cGoing forward, the video will be visible on the service with a sensitive media interstitial and only in cases where the Tweet content does not otherwise violate the Twitter Rules.\u201d As of Friday afternoon, the tweet in question was visible once again. \u201cVictory!!!\u201d the account tweeted. \u201cThank you to EVERYONE for helping #FreeMitch.\u201d The dispute over the account was first reported by The Louisville Courier-Journal. The Twitter lockout added to a turbulent week for Mr. McConnell\u2019s campaign, which drew criticism after two separate episodes involving social media, and for Mr. McConnell himself. The majority leader is recovering from a fractured shoulder and has been under pressure from Democrats and some Republicans to bring up gun control legislation in the Senate in the wake of two mass shootings that killed more than 30 people and injured dozens more. In the radio interview on Thursday, Mr. McConnell expressed a new willingness to allow the Senate to consider a measure expanding background checks for gun purchasers when lawmakers returned in September. Critics of Mr. McConnell\u2019s longtime inaction on gun control pilloried him on Twitter this week using the hashtag #MassacreMitch. That was a twist on the #MoscowMitch moniker his adversaries had developed a week earlier to chastise him for blocking election security legislation. In the video that prompted the Twitter lockout, a protester can be heard using expletives to describe the senator and suggesting that rather than injure his shoulder, Mr. McConnell \u201cshould have broken\u201d his neck. She also muses that someone or something should be stabbed in the heart. After it was shut out of its account, Mr. McConnell\u2019s campaign and some of his supporters complained vigorously that Twitter\u2019s move had set a double standard on what kind of speech was allowed. By Thursday afternoon, officials from the Republican National Committee and the National Republican Senatorial Committee entered the fray, saying they would forgo buying new ads on Twitter until it unfroze the Team Mitch account. And by late Thursday, Mr. McConnell declared to WHAS radio in Louisville that he and his team were \u201cin a major war\u201d with Twitter and had not given up their fight. Having apparently won that fight, Kevin Golden, Mr. McConnell\u2019s campaign manager, said Friday that he and his team were pleased that Twitter had \u201creversed their decision.\u201d \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t have taken an avalanche of outrage from across the country to stop Silicon Valley from launching an effort to silence conservatives like the majority leader of the United States Senate in the first place,\u201d Mr. Golden said in a statement. The other Twitter turmoil involving Mr. McConnell began over the weekend when the Team Mitch account posted a photo of a mock graveyard filled with faux tombs marked with the names of people and policies Mr. McConnell has opposed. (Mr. McConnell, who is running for re-election in 2020, has sometimes cast himself as the \u201cgrim reaper\u201d for liberal legislation.) One of the tombstones was labeled \u201cAmy McGrath\u201d and dated Nov. 3, 2020, which is Election Day. Ms. McGrath, a Democrat and retired Marine, is challenging Mr. McConnell for his Senate seat. She criticized him for posting the photo soon after the shooting in El Paso on Saturday, and said she found it \u201ctroubling that our politics have become so nasty and personal that the Senate majority leader thinks it\u2019s appropriate to use imagery of the death of a political opponent (me) as messaging.\u201d Then on Monday, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York, reposted a photo of a group of young men wearing \u201cTeam Mitch\u201d T-shirts clustered around a cardboard cutout of her. One of the young men had his hand at the cutout\u2019s neck, while another appeared to be going in for a kiss. \u201cAre you paying for young men to practice groping & choking members of Congress w/ your payroll, or is this just the standard culture of #TeamMitch?\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez wrote in her tweet to Mr. McConnell. In a series of statements, Mr. Golden said the young men were high school students and not campaign staff members, and added that \u201cTeam Mitch in no way condones any aggressive, suggestive or demeaning act toward life-size cardboard cutouts of any gender.\u201d As for the faux graveyard, he said supporters had \u201cbuilt a homage\u201d to an editorial cartoon that appeared in The Lexington Herald-Leader earlier this year. \u201cThis is the problem with the speech police in America today,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Lexington Herald can attack Mitch with cartoon tombstones of his opponents, but we can\u2019t mock it.\u201d",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Facing mounting criticism for blocking proposals to bolster election security, Senator Mitch McConnell on Thursday threw his weight behind a new infusion of $250 million to help states guard against outside interference in the 2020 voting. Mr. McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, has been under regular attack from both Democrats and a conservative group for refusing to allow the Senate to vote on various election security proposals, some of them bipartisan, despite dire warnings from the intelligence community that Russia is already trying to replicate the elaborate meddling campaign it carried out during the 2016 presidential contest. The additional funding, Mr. McConnell said in announcing his support, \u201cwill bring our total allocation for election security \u2014 listen to this \u2014 to more than $600 million since fiscal 2018.\u201d The money was quickly approved by the Appropriations Committee later Thursday. Though Mr. McConnell has embraced other seemingly derogatory nicknames over the years, he was incensed at being called \u201cMoscow Mitch\u201d by those who claimed his opposition showed he was willing to accept foreign election interference because it had benefited his own party by helping to elect President Trump, despite the senator\u2019s long record of taking a hard line against Russia. Aides said that the criticism had not driven Mr. McConnell\u2019s decision to back the measure, and that he had always planned to support new money for state election offices as part of the annual spending bills now working their way through Congress. He and other Republicans, wary of too much federal intervention in state-run elections, preferred providing the new money without new federal requirements that could be added in legislation being pushed by Democrats, they said. Still, Senate Republicans had previously opposed similar proposals. On Thursday, they said the increase was a way to reassure the public that the states would have the resources they needed to protect the integrity of their elections. \u201cWhile different states have used this money in different ways \u2014 and some states frankly haven\u2019t used it all \u2014 generally this money has moved the states toward much more security than they otherwise would have had,\u201d said Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri and the chairman of the Rules Committee. Democrats and activist groups who favor more money have also pushed for sweeping election overhauls circulating in the House and the Senate. But they still welcomed what they painted as a sudden change of heart from Mr. McConnell. \u201cLeader McConnell kept saying we don\u2019t need the money,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader. \u201cBut now, thank God, he has seen the light.\u201d \u201cIf Americans don\u2019t believe their elections are on the up-and-up, woe is us as a country and as a democracy,\u201d Mr. Schumer said. \u201cIt is not all the money we requested, and it doesn\u2019t include a single solitary reform that virtually everyone knows we need, but it\u2019s a start.\u201d States would be allowed to use the money in various ways, but part of the federal effort is to make certain that all of them have a voting system in place that includes a way for results to be audited. The added money was included in a bipartisan proposal offered by the two leaders of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama and the chairman, and Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, the senior Democrat, along with Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware. Other members of the panel hailed it as a potential breakthrough that could lead to more election security measures being advanced by Congress. \u201cElections are the bedrock of our democracy, and Congress has a patriotic duty to protect them,\u201d said Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire. \u201cIn addition to funding, there are many steps that Congress needs to take to make sure foreign adversaries don\u2019t have free rein to interfere in our democratic process.\u201d In opposing the other election overhauls, Mr. McConnell has criticized them as Democratic attempts to gain a partisan advantage. He also argued that many new protections had already been put in place since 2016, and that the 2018 election showed that they were working. \u201cThe Trump administration has made enormous strides to help states secure their elections without giving Washington new power to push the states around,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. Still, the embrace of the new allocation showed that the attacks on Mr. McConnell and his Republican colleagues over election security were effective enough to shake loose a substantial amount of additional money, leaving open the possibility that the funding could even increase as the Senate enters final spending negotiations with the Democratically controlled House.",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 It was only a few weeks ago that the top Senate Republican was hinting that his chamber would make short work of impeachment. But this week, Senator Mitch McConnell sat his colleagues down over lunch in the Capitol and warned them to prepare for an extended impeachment trial of President Trump. According to people who were there, he came equipped with a PowerPoint presentation, complete with quotes from the Constitution, as he schooled fellow senators on the intricacies of a process he portrayed as all but inevitable. Few Republicans are inclined to convict Mr. Trump on charges that he abused his power to enlist Ukraine in an effort to smear his political rivals. Instead, Mr. McConnell sees the proceedings as necessary to protect a half a dozen moderates in states like Maine, Colorado and North Carolina who face re-election next year and must show voters they are giving the House impeachment charges a serious review. It\u2019s people like Senator Susan Collins of Maine who will be under immense political pressure as they decide the president\u2019s fate. \u201cTo overturn an election, to decide whether or not to convict a president is about as serious as it gets,\u201d Ms. Collins said. Mr. McConnell is walking a careful line of his own in managing the fast-moving impeachment process. On Friday, the senator wrote a scathing op-ed criticizing the president\u2019s decision to pull back troops from northern Syria, calling it a \u201cgrave strategic mistake.\u201d But Mr. McConnell views it as his role to protect a president of his own party from impeachment and in a recent fund-raising video, he vowed to stop it. The mood among Republicans on Capitol Hill has shifted from indignant to anxious as a parade of administration witnesses has submitted to closed-door questioning by impeachment investigators and corroborated central elements of the whistle-blower complaint that sparked the inquiry. They grew more worried still on Thursday, after Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, undercut the president\u2019s defense by saying that Mr. Trump had indeed withheld security aid from Ukraine in order to spur an investigation of his political rivals. Mr. Mulvaney later backtracked, but the damage was done. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it \u2014 I was very surprised that he said that,\u201d said Representative Francis Rooney, Republican of Florida, who mocked Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s attempts to take back comments that had been broadcast live from the White House briefing room. \u201cIt\u2019s not an Etch A Sketch,\u201d Mr. Rooney said, miming the tipping movement that erases the toy drawing board. \u201cThere were a lot of Republicans looking at that headline yesterday when it came up, I certainly was.\u201d Senator Lisa Murkowski \u2014 an Alaskan Republican who is seen as potentially open to removing Mr. Trump from office \u2014 told reporters that a president should never engage in the kinds of actions that Mr. Mulvaney appeared to acknowledge. \u201cYou don\u2019t hold up foreign aid that we had previously appropriated for a political initiative,\u201d she said. \u201cPeriod.\u201d Still, Republicans said they did not detect a significant shift that would pose a serious threat to the president in the Senate. It would require 20 Republicans to side with Democrats in convicting Mr. Trump, and few observers believe that will happen. Mr. McConnell, his allies said, regards the impeachment fight in much the same way as he did the struggle last year to confirm Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, in which he was primarily concerned with protecting his Senate majority by insulating vulnerable incumbents. Then, as now, they said, Mr. McConnell is focused on keeping Republicans as united as possible, while allowing those with reservations about Mr. Trump\u2019s conduct and their own political considerations to justify their decision to their constituents. \u201cI think he will play it straight,\u201d said Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas and a close McConnell ally, who noted his party\u2019s narrow voting margin. \u201cI don\u2019t think he has any alternative. When you are operating with 53 you have thin margins and you can\u2019t jam anybody or you end up with undesirable consequences.\u201d Mr. McConnell has told colleagues he expects the House to impeach Mr. Trump quickly, possibly by Thanksgiving, an educated hunch based on the pace of the inquiry so far and Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s decision to keep the inquiry narrowly focused on Mr. Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine. He plans to move swiftly too, he told colleagues, using the approach of Christmas to force the Senate to complete its work before the beginning of 2020. Yet an impeachment trial is a spectacle that is by its nature unpredictable, and most of the senators who will act as jurors were not around for the last one, of Bill Clinton in 1999. Mr. McConnell reminded senators that Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. would preside over the trial, and would have wide latitude in handling motions that might be made, including any motion to dismiss the charges that Republicans might try to put forward to short circuit the process. Mr. McConnell\u2019s declaration that the Senate would move forward was in part designed to show he had no choice, an effort to deflect criticism from conservatives outraged that the Senate would even consider impeachment. On Wednesday, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, pushed for Senate Republicans to write a letter to Ms. Pelosi declaring that they would not remove the president. But some senators raised objections, worrying that some of their colleagues would not want to sign on, a result that would expose disunity among Republicans. Mr. Graham\u2019s colleagues said they believe they staved off the letter, which they viewed as a mistake. Mr. McConnell has made it clear that he plans to sit down with Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, to see if they can find a mutually acceptable way to move forward as Democrats and Republicans did in 1999 when they unanimously agreed on the framework for the impeachment trial. The Senate is much more polarized now, though Mr. Schumer this week held out hope. \u201cWe have to do this trial in a fair and bipartisan way and I hope that Leader McConnell would obey those strictures,\u201d Mr. Schumer said. In the battle for Senate control, Democrats have their own political risks to consider since impeachment could prompt a backlash against some of their candidates if enough voters conclude that the president was pursued unfairly. Just 15 senators remain in office from the time Mr. Clinton was put on trial. Mr. McConnell warned them of the weight of the trial, where they can be required to be on the floor all afternoon six days a week without speaking \u2014 a major challenge for senators who relish their chances to be heard. \u201cIt will mean day after day sitting in chamber, listening to the two sides, writing questions for them to answer that go through the chief justice,\u201d said Ms. Collins, one of the Republicans who voted to acquit Mr. Clinton 20 years ago. \u201cMembers who have not been through this before will find it is a great deal of work.\u201d",
