      "subtitle": "European Talks With Iran End, Leaving Nuclear Issue UnsettledIran\u2019s deputy foreign minister said Tehran will now decide whether to follow through on a plan to breach limits on how much nuclear fuel the country can hold.By David E. SangerPRINT EDITIONEuropean Talks With Iran on Nuclear Fuel Limits End With No Deal|June 29, 2019, Page A6",
      "author": "David E. Sanger",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 A last-minute effort by European powers to persuade Iran not to breach limits on its stockpile of nuclear fuel ended inconclusively on Friday, with the Iranians saying that Britain, France and Germany had made only modest progress in developing a system to get around tight American sanctions on trade with Tehran. As he left the talks in Vienna, Abbas Araghchi, the Iranian deputy foreign minister, said he expected Iran would go ahead with its plan to break the ceiling on how much low-enriched uranium it was allowed to possess. That breach could come as early as this weekend, potentially setting off another confrontation with the Trump administration, after a week of recriminations and military threats following the downing of an American drone and attacks on tankers. \u201cIt is still not enough, and it is still not meeting Iran\u2019s expectations,\u201d Mr. Araghchi told reporters, according to news reports from Vienna. Any decision on whether to break out of the limits \u201cwill be made in Tehran,\u201d he said, hinting that it was possible that further steps to violate the terms of the agreement, scheduled for July 7, might be delayed. The limits on nuclear fuel were part of a 2015 accord negotiated with Iran by the Obama administration and other big countries, including Russia and China. The deal put strict limits on Iran\u2019s nuclear activities in return for the easing of sanctions. President Trump ended the participation of the United States in the accord last year, saying it did not do enough to assure that Iran could never possess a nuclear weapon or to thwart Iranian aggression in the region. Iran initially continued to abide by the deal\u2019s terms even after Mr. Trump pulled out, and its threats now to break out of the accord amount to a search for leverage by the government of President Hassan Rouhani. By remaining in compliance with the agreement, Iran hoped to split the Europeans, Chinese and Russians from the United States. Eager to keep the deal\u2019s main provisions intact, the Europeans have been holding out the possibility of a deal that would allow limited trade with Iran by setting up a barter system to sidestep the American sanctions. But the barter system has taken a long time to come together, and Mr. Rouhani\u2019s government bet that if it moved toward renouncing the nuclear accord, it would force Europe into action. Breaking the stockpile limit would not, by itself, give Iran enough fuel to produce a nuclear weapon. But the European participants in the 2015 agreement have been urging the Iranians not to dispense with the accord, for fear that the Trump administration might react with a military or cyberstrike against the Iranians. During talks in Vienna, the Europeans and Iranians were working on details of establishing a barter-trading system, called Instex, that was designed to route around the American sanctions against Iran. But the Europeans have been describing their plans for a year, and declared Friday that the system was just beginning to work \u2014 even though it is widely acknowledged that the system would never be robust enough to make up the oil revenue lost to Iran from the United States sanctions. The United States\u2019 special envoy for Iran, Brian H. Hook, said this week that the sanctions have already cost Iran more than $50 billion. International nuclear inspectors say Iran is on the cusp of exceeding the stockpile limit. The Trump administration\u2019s position has been that while Washington was free to renounce the agreement, Iran was bound to remain inside it. Should Iran decide to break out of the agreement in coming days, it will create a major decision point for the United States and Europeans. Mr. Trump\u2019s hard-line advisers, including John R. Bolton, the national security adviser, have long called for a permanent dismantlement of Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities, by military action if necessary. The Europeans have, until now, blamed Washington for the crisis, though some European officials say that if Iran violated the limits, it may force them to start a process to \u201csnap back\u201d sanctions, under steps laid out in the 2015 document. Some Iranian officials have gone further in recent weeks, suggesting that Iran might exit the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which it signed nearly 50 years ago. That treaty forbids any non-nuclear-weapon states that are signatories from building atomic weapons, and requires them to allow in international inspectors. Iran has always contended that it has no interest in building atomic weapons, though documents that have emerged from the country \u2014 including a huge archive of documents spirited out of Iran in a raid by Israel last year \u2014 suggest that before 2003, Iran had an advanced program developing weapons designs.",

      "content": " President Obama laid out a foreign policy vision on Wednesday for his final two and a half years in office, responding to critics who have said the United States has been rudderless amid crises. Mr. Obama\u2019s critics were quick to respond to his speech. A few of those responses are highlighted below: \u201cThis seemed to be an attempt to make the case for what you might call threading the needle between too much and too little involvement in the world. It seemed to be making the case for a responsible, centrist approach. But it was more clear what it was against, than what it was actually for.\u201d \u2014 Richard N. Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations *** \u201cSince President Obama took office, a series of foreign policy plans and visions have been put forward; assurances have been made. But too often, strong words have been followed by weak actions, or no actions. The result has been a general loss of U.S. credibility, making successful foreign policy nearly impossible.\u201d \u2014 Representative Ed Royce, Republican of California and chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee *** \u201cToday, the president proved once again that he is intent on picking his conflicts based on politics, instead of dealing with the problems at hand. He has elected to pull out of Afghanistan based on arbitrary timetables, as opposed to building on the progress and sacrifices of both our Armed Forces and the Afghan people, and is choosing to leave too soon. Conversely, he has chosen to engage in Syria too late.\u201d \u201cThis president must come to grips with the fact that Islamist extremism and Al Qaeda-linked groups are spreading, becoming more powerful and still intend to do us harm. Therefore America\u2019s leadership, not its withdrawal, is more crucial than ever.\u201d \u2014 Representative Michael McCaul, Republican of Texas and chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee **** \u201cClear, effective #Obama speech at #West Point. Call for US leadership as \u2018indispensable\u2019 and \u2018exceptional.\u2019 And more focus on diplomacy.\u201d \u2014 R. Nicholas Burns, a former undersecretary of state for George W. Bush, on Twitter **** \u201cFrom drones and emissions, to the South China Sea to Somalia to the Crimea and back again, it\u2019s not easy connect the many dots of America\u2019s foreign policies. Because aside from tortured rhetoric, unified they are not. From his speech, it sounds like Obama is convinced of the right things: negotiation (not war) with Iran; a push for nuclear disarmament; cutting carbon emissions. But it\u2019s hard not to wish that there was a greater sense of someone stitching these many threads into a greater whole, while abandoning those parts, like drone strikes, that are downright wrong.\u201d \u2014 Carne Ross, a former British diplomat writing on theguardian.com",

      "author": "Michael D. Shear",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 If life in the White House has prematurely aged President Obama, his vital statistics do not show it. Mr. Obama\u2019s latest medical report shows him to be five pounds lighter than he was at the time of his last physical exam, in June 2014, with a slower resting heart beat, lower blood pressure and a reduced cholesterol level. Mr. Obama, 54, was examined by Dr. Ronny L. Jackson, last month. Dr. Jackson said that Mr. Obama no longer smoked but occasionally used nicotine gum. Mr. Obama takes Nexium for \u201coccasional acid reflux symptoms,\u201d as well as daily vitamin D tablets. Here are the highlights of the two-page report. WEIGHT: 175 pounds. Presidential basketball games are a thing of the past, but Mr. Obama remains a fitness enthusiast, working out regularly at the White House and on the road. (The early-morning motorcade from the hotel to the gym is a regular occurrence.) Dr. Jackson cited exercise as the reason for an \u201cimproved lean body mass.\u201d In 2014, it was 23.7 kilograms per meter squared; now it is 22.8 kilograms per meter squared. HEART RATE: 56 beats a minute. It\u2019s not as if the president\u2019s job is becoming less stressful, but Mr. Obama appears able to remain calm amid the swirl. In 2014, his resting heart rate was 62 beats a minute, or about 10 percent faster. BLOOD PRESSURE: 110/68. There has been plenty to make the president\u2019s blood pressure rise over the past year or so: foreign policy crises, a recalcitrant Congress, and Donald J. Trump. But his blood pressure has dipped a bit, from 112/70. CHOLESTEROL: 188 milligrams per deciliter of blood. Mr. Obama has frequently said he likes a good plate of nachos with guacamole. But it looks as if he has been listening more to his nutrition-conscious wife, Michelle. His cholesterol level has dropped significantly since 2014, when it was 213. And there is no indication that Mr. Obama is taking cholesterol-lowering medications. Dr. Jackson attributed the improvement to the exercise and to \u201chis adherence to a healthy diet.\u201d",

      "author": "Edward Wong",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 As President Trump reveled in his historic weekend stroll into North Korea, administration officials were sharply at odds on Monday over what demands to make of Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, while preparing to restart negotiations on a nuclear deal. Pushing an internal debate into the open, John R. Bolton, the national security adviser and the most prominent hawk in the administration, reacted angrily to a report in The New York Times about the possibility of a deal to effectively freeze North Korea\u2019s nuclear activity in return for American concessions. Some officials are considering a freeze as a first step toward a more comprehensive agreement for Mr. Kim to give up his entire nuclear program. Mr. Bolton has long insisted that the North Koreans dismantle their nuclear program and give up their entire arsenal of warheads before getting any rewards. \u201cThis was a reprehensible attempt by someone to box in the president,\u201d Mr. Bolton wrote on Twitter. \u201cThere should be consequences.\u201d But some senior administration officials have been discussing the idea of an incremental approach under which North Korea would first close down its nuclear facilities to prevent it from making new fissile material, in effect freezing its program but leaving its existing arsenal in place. In exchange, the Americans would make some concessions that would help improve the living conditions in North Korea, which is under heavy sanctions, or strengthen relations between Washington and Pyongyang. Among those considering such ideas are senior diplomats, say people familiar with the discussions. Mr. Trump, eager to burnish his self-constructed image as a dealmaker in the run-up to the 2020 presidential election, appears open to embracing a step-by-step process. Mr. Trump did not publicly mention full denuclearization during his hour at the border between the two Koreas on Sunday or after talks with South Korean leaders. In April, during a visit to the White House by President Moon Jae-in of South Korea, Mr. Trump signaled that gradual concessions by both sides might be necessary. \u201cThere are various smaller deals that could happen,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could work out step-by-step pieces, but at this moment, we\u2019re talking about the big deal. The big deal is we have to get rid of nuclear weapons.\u201d American officials involved in North Korea policy assert, even in private, that the administration\u2019s long-run goal has been consistent all along: to have Mr. Kim, with whom Mr. Trump met at the border on Sunday, give up all of his nuclear weapons and the ability to build more. In the short run, Mr. Trump\u2019s public comments \u2014 and the showmanship of going to the Demilitarized Zone and stepping over a low concrete barrier to walk with Mr. Kim on his soil \u2014 is another sign of the limited influence of Mr. Trump\u2019s most hard-line advisers. Mr. Bolton was not at the meeting in North Korea but on a scheduled trip to Mongolia. Last month, Mr. Trump at the last minute rejected Mr. Bolton\u2019s urging for a military strike on Iran. On Monday, after Mr. Bolton made his statement, Mr. Trump spoke effusively on Twitter about his weekend trip to the Koreas without disputing the possibility of a step-by-step approach. \u201cWhile there, it was great to call on Chairman Kim of North Korea to have our very well covered meeting,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cGood things can happen for all!\u201d Mr. Trump has given Secretary of State Mike Pompeo responsibility for restarting negotiations, which had stalled after a failed February summit in Hanoi, Vietnam, between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim. It was the second time the two had met, and Mr. Trump at the time had insisted that Mr. Kim give up his entire nuclear program, including an estimated 30 to 60 warheads, in exchange for sanctions relief. Mr. Bolton and Mr. Pompeo had both urged the president to settle for nothing less than a grand deal, but Mr. Pompeo now appears open to considering a gradual approach. The State Department declined to comment on Monday. On Sunday night, Stephen E. Biegun, the United States\u2019 special representative for North Korea, told The Times that its account of the ideas being discussed in the administration was \u201cpure speculation\u201d and that his team was \u201cnot preparing any new proposal currently.\u201d Some analysts said any approach must start with the United States and North Korea committing to a common definition of denuclearization. Without an ironclad definition, there is greater risk the North Koreans could back out of an interim deal, as they have done under previous American administrations, they said. \u201cThere\u2019s a myriad of ways that North Korea can pull it back,\u201d said Jung H. Pak, a former C.I.A. analyst who is now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. For months after the meeting in Hanoi, there was no senior-level contact between Washington and Pyongyang, then Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim exchanged letters. That paved the way for Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter post from the G20 summit in Japan on Saturday, in which he said he would like to see Mr. Kim during a scheduled visit Sunday to the Demilitarized Zone, on the border between the two Koreas, to shake Mr. Kim\u2019s hand and to \u201csay Hello(?)!\u201d Mr. Pompeo and other officials scrambled to organize for a potential meeting. Mr. Trump asked Mr. Pompeo to accompany him to the heavily guarded border village of Panmunjom, along with Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, his eldest daughter and his son-in-law. Mr. Bolton notably flew to Mongolia instead. \u201cDelighted to be in Ulaanbaatar,\u201d he said on Twitter above a photograph of him smiling with the country\u2019s secretary of state, Davaasuren Damdinsuren. Though Mr. Pompeo is often aligned with Mr. Bolton on an aggressive approach to national security issues \u2014 Mr. Pompeo has also advocated a strike on Iran \u2014 the secretary of state is acutely attuned to Mr. Trump\u2019s desires and has tried diplomacy with the North Koreans when commanded by the president. In interviews and talks in recent weeks, Mr. Pompeo has not mentioned his earlier insistence that North Koreans must first turn over a complete list of nuclear assets, which some experts say is a necessary first step to establishing baselines for full denuclearization. Administration officials say Mr. Biegun has been trying to come up with creative ways to get North Korea to at least agree with the Americans on a common definition of denuclearization and to start the process of shutting down its program. American intelligence officials have assessed that Mr. Kim will probably never give up all of his nuclear weapons. That is where serious consideration of a step-by-step process comes in. In January, during a speech at Stanford University, Mr. Biegun signaled that American negotiators might be willing to push off the demand for an inventory of nuclear assets and engage in a more gradual process. \u201cSequencing always confounds negotiators,\u201d he said. Mr. Trump\u2019s grand-deal gambit in Hanoi upended that thinking. But that summit\u2019s failure has left the door open for other ideas. Negotiators are back at a new starting line, essentially the same place they were after Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim\u2019s first summit, held in Singapore in June 2018. Doing a yearslong gradual process with a freeze on activity as the initial goal would amount to tacit acceptance of North Korea as a nuclear state. But American officials in both the White House and State Department say sanctions would not be lifted until North Korea completely gets rid of its nuclear weapons and its program. That includes the five sets of sanctions imposed by the Obama and Trump administrations starting in 2016 that North Korean officials say they most want the United States to cancel. In Hanoi, Mr. Kim made this demand of Mr. Trump. For now, American officials might consider allowing more robust humanitarian aid to enter North Korea or some limited economic exchanges between the North and South, which under Mr. Moon has been pushing forward on an inter-Korean peace process. The two sides could also open interests offices in each other\u2019s capitals. In the approaches under consideration, those concessions would happen only if North Korea agrees to halt all its uranium enrichment \u2014 not only at Yongbyon, the central site of its nuclear program, but also at Kangson, another site known to American officials. American intelligence officials also suspect there may be a third site, say experts on North Korea\u2019s nuclear program.",

Shear and Adam LiptakPRINT EDITIONSupreme Court  Agrees to Hear \u2018Dreamers\u2019 Case|June 29, 2019, Page A1",
      "author": "Michael D. Shear",
      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 For seven years, the so-called Dreamers \u2014 nearly 800,000 young men and women who were brought to the United States illegally as children \u2014 have lived in limbo, protected from immediate deportation but without the guarantee of any permanent future in the United States. On Friday, the Supreme Court agreed to resolve their fate, an announcement that sets in motion what is likely to be a yearlong legal clash over immigration policy and the power of the presidency that will probably culminate next summer with a ruling by the justices. But by agreeing to take the case, the Supreme Court also provided a window of opportunity during which the Republicans and Democrats in Congress could permanently resolve the status of the young immigrants, perhaps by giving them a chance to earn citizenship. At stake is a program that protects Dreamers known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, that President Barack Obama created through executive action in 2012. Mr. Trump tried to end the program in 2017, calling it an \u201cend-run around Congress\u201d and saying that Mr. Obama\u2019s use of executive authority to protect the immigrants violated \u201cthe core tenets that sustain our Republic.\u201d Members of both parties, as well as Mr. Trump on several occasions, have expressed sympathy for the Dreamers, many of them fully assimilated young men and women in school or with careers. But there is no evidence that a deal is likely. For years, lawmakers have failed to reach any kind of consensus despite repeated attempts at negotiation. In 2018, a possible deal collapsed amid demands from Mr. Trump for restrictive changes to immigration laws and billions of dollars to build a wall along the southwestern border. This month, the Democrat-led House passed sweeping legislation that would provide a path to citizenship for Dreamers and other immigrants whose legal status Mr. Trump has targeted. But the legislation is already languishing in the Republican-controlled Senate, where opponents view it as amnesty for lawbreakers. \u201cWe will continue to fight tirelessly to protect these outstanding young men and women as we work to ensure America remains a nation of hope, freedom and opportunity for all,\u201d Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement after the court\u2019s announcement on Friday. Immigration advocacy groups have said they plan to urge Dreamers to renew their protections under DACA, which expire every two years, until the fate of the program is decided by Congress or the Supreme Court. Since July 1, the federal government has approved more than 373,000 renewal requests. During his 2016 presidential campaign, Mr. Trump vowed to end the DACA program, making it part of the anti-immigrant message that helped fire up his supporters. When he won, he promised to follow through even as he expressed sympathy for the Dreamers, a group of whom he had met with years earlier. On the day of his inauguration, he told a Democratic senator that he should not worry about the young immigrants. But by September 2017, a group of conservative state attorneys general were threatening to sue the government if the president refused to make good on his promise to end the DACA program. Against the advice of lawmakers in both parties, Mr. Trump ordered that the program be terminated. At the same time, Mr. Trump delayed the program\u2019s end by six months, saying he wanted to give Congress time to pass legislation that would permanently protect the Dreamers from deportation and give them an eventual path to citizenship. \u201cWe will resolve the DACA issue with heart and compassion \u2014 but through the lawful Democratic process,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a statement after ending the program. \u201cIt is now time for Congress to act!\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s six-month deadline initially put pressure on lawmakers in both parties to reach a deal. But that faded when a lower court judge blocked his decision to end DACA and ordered the government to continue operating it. In November, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, ruled against the administration. It acknowledged that presidents have broad powers to alter the policies of earlier administrations but said the legal rationale offered by the Trump administration did not withstand scrutiny. The court also questioned \u201cthe cruelty and wastefulness of deporting productive young people to countries with which they have no ties.\u201d In May, a second federal appeals court, the Fourth Circuit in Richmond, Va., issued a similar ruling. The Trump administration has long sought to persuade the Supreme Court to rule on whether it had the authority to cancel the program. But the justices turned down an unusual petition seeking review in January 2018, before any appeals court had ruled. The administration asked again in November, not long before the Ninth Circuit ruled. For many months, the Supreme Court took no action on the request, which was at odds with the court\u2019s usual practice. On Friday, before the justices left for their summer break, the court agreed to hear an appeal of the Ninth Circuit decision, Department of Homeland Security v. Regents of the University of California, No. 18-587, along with two others in which appeals courts have not yet ruled: Trump v. NAACP, No. 18-588, and McAleenan v. Vidal, No. 18-589. The administration has argued that the program was an unconstitutional exercise of executive authority, relying on a ruling from the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, that shut down a related program created by Mr. Obama, Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, or DAPA, saying he had exceeded his statutory authority. In his executive action establishing DAPA, which was blocked by courts before it went into effect, Mr. Obama would have allowed as many as five million unauthorized immigrants who were the parents of citizens or of lawful permanent residents to apply for a program sparing them from deportation and providing them work permits. After the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in 2016, the Supreme Court deadlocked, 4 to 4, in an appeal of the Fifth Circuit\u2019s ruling, leaving it in place and ending what Mr. Obama had hoped would become one of his central legacies. The Trump administration has argued that the DAPA ruling meant that DACA was also unlawful. In its decision in November, the Ninth Circuit said the two programs differed in important ways, rejecting the administration\u2019s legal analysis. The appeals court affirmed a nationwide injunction ordering the administration to retain major elements of the program while the case moved forward. Such nationwide injunctions, which have been used by courts to block executive actions in both the Obama and the Trump administrations, have been the subject of much commentary and criticism. The Supreme Court will hear arguments in the case during its next term, which starts in October. If a deal is not reached, a decision by the court next summer could roil the presidential campaign, no matter which way the court rules. A decision to let the Trump administration end the program could energize angry Democratic voters and immigration advocates to campaign even more aggressively against the president. If the court prevents Mr. Trump from ending DACA, that could fire up his base of voters.",

GreenPRINT EDITIONRules on For-Profit Schools Are Repealed|June 29, 2019, Page A15",
      "author": "Erica L. Green",
      "content": " Education Secretary Betsy DeVos on Friday officially repealed an Obama-era regulation that sought to crack down on for-profit colleges and universities that produced graduates with no meaningful job prospects and mountains of student debt they could not hope to repay. The so-called gainful employment rule was issued by the Obama administration in 2014, right before huge for-profit chains collapsed, leaving students stranded with debt and worthless degrees. Under the new standards, career and certificate programs, many of which operate in the for-profit sector, would have to prove their graduates could find gainful employment to maintain access to federal financial aid. It also would have required schools to disclose in advertisements a comparison of the student debt load of their graduates and their career earnings. In her first two years in office, Ms. DeVos has delayed critical parts of the rule, and last year, she sought to repeal it entirely, siding with for-profit industry leaders and congressional conservatives who have contended that the Obama administration unfairly targeted for-profit schools. Education Department officials have argued that transparency, not regulation, is the best way to hold all schools \u2014 public nonprofits, community colleges and for-profits \u2014 accountable for their results. Instead of any accountability measures, it promised to expand an existing database, called the College Scorecard, to provide information on student debt and earnings prospects. The database, which provides information, including loan debt information, for 2,100 certificate granting programs, was unveiled last month. On Friday, Ms. DeVos said that the scorecard was \u201conly the beginning.\u201d \u201cThese important reforms are a more complete and effective way to hold all types of higher education institutions accountable and make sure that students have a full suite of data when making a decision about their education,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cThis administration will continue to put students first and make sure they not only have a multitude of pathways to success post-high school but also the information they need to make the best choices for themselves.\u201d But in rescinding the rule, the department is eradicating the most fearsome accountability measure \u2014 the loss of federal aid \u2014 for schools that promise to furnish students with specific career skills but fail to prepare them for the job market, leaving taxpayers on the hook to pay back their loans. Congressional Democrats and student advocates said rescinding the rule would leave the scandal-scarred for-profit college industry unchecked. The repeal will take effect July 2020. The department estimated that repealing the rule would cost $6.2 billion over 10 years, which includes funding grants and loans to students attending schools that would have been cut off from federal funding under the Obama rule. \u201cRepealing \u2014 rather than revising or replacing \u2014 the gainful employment rule will prop up low-quality for-profit colleges at the expense of students and taxpayers,\u201d said Representative Robert C. Scott of Virginia, the chairman of the House education panel. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement underscores the need for Congress to pass a comprehensive reauthorization of the Higher Education Act that protects students and taxpayers from low quality for-profit schools.\u201d Bob Shireman, a senior fellow at the Century Foundation and an architect of the rule when he was in the Obama administration, called the repeal \u201cdisturbing and shortsighted.\u201d \u201cThey are opening the door to operators whose singular focus on gobbling up federal grants and loans for their investors will steer the business toward manipulative recruiting and poor quality training,\u201d he said. The Obama administration began drafting the regulations when the for-profit college sector was booming, with large chains enrolling 500,000 students at a time. But it was seen as a crucial safeguard against predatory colleges after the collapse of ITT Tech and Corinthian Colleges beginning in 2015. The Obama administration also tried to channel loan relief to graduates who were defrauded by their colleges. Ms. DeVos has moved to overhaul that \u201cborrower-defense\u201d rule as well, hoping to give some students only partial relief. That process has been tied up in court proceedings, leaving more than 150,000 student claims in limbo. One part of the gainful employment rule that had already been put into place has identified hundreds of failing programs, many of which went on to close after they were measured against the new standards. In the Education Department\u2019s first assessment of debt-to-earnings ratios for college graduates, about 98 percent of programs that failed to meet standards for earning power were for-profits. An analysis included in the department\u2019s final rule also shows that for-profits continued to have a significantly higher failure rate. But the department argued in its final rule that the debt-to-earnings formula created by the Obama administration was \u201cfundamentally flawed\u201d and did not account for factors other than the quality of an education that could affect students\u2019 earning potential. The department also said that the rule did not properly account for other kinds of programs that have poor career outcomes and high debt, such as some liberal arts degrees. For-profit leaders have said that although the Obama rule was never fully enforced, its intent already shut down the worst-performing schools in their sector. Since 2010, when the Obama administration began deliberating the rules, more than 2,000 for-profit and career programs \u2014 nearly half \u2014 have closed, and the industry\u2019s student population has dropped by more than 1.6 million. \u201cThe U.S. Department of Education\u2019s final decision commits our nation\u2019s entire higher education system to full transparency,\u201d said Steve Gunderson, the president of Career Education Colleges and Universities, the for-profit trade group. \u201cInstead of picking and choosing winners and losers in higher education, the department will make available, in a student-friendly and transparent manner, key data points at a program level for all programs at all schools.\u201d",

      "subtitle": "Interview With President ObamaThe following is a transcript of an interview with President Obama in Galesburg, Ill., by New York Times reporters.By The New York Times",
      "author": "The New York Times",
      "content": " Following is a transcript of an interview with President Obama conducted by Jackie Calmes and Michael D. Shear of The New York Times. The interview was conducted at Knox College in Galesburg, Ill., on July 24, 2013. NYT: So we\u2019re here with you, already four years since the recession officially ended. And as your speech sort of laid out, you still have a situation where growth remains slow, income\u2019s is unequal, and a lot of American -- unemployment high -- and a lot of Americans start to worry that this is the new normal. Your intentions aside like you stated them out there in the speech, why shouldn\u2019t we expect that you\u2019re going to leave behind an economy that\u2019s fragile, continued income inequality, and a weakened middle class? MR. OBAMA: Well, obviously, what Congress does matters. As I said in the speech, the economy is far stronger now than it was four and a half years ago. Most economists believe that growth will actually pick up next quarter and the second half of the year. And the one thing that could really screw things up would be if you have a manufactured crisis and Republicans choose to play brinksmanship all over again. And I\u2019m glad to see that there are folks in the Senate who I think have already indicated that that is not good policy. We can have debates about fiscal issues without precipitating a crisis. Certainly the idea that we wouldn\u2019t pay our bills and plunge not just the United States but potentially the world into another financial crisis makes absolutely no sense. But what I also said out there is true that if we stand pat, if we don\u2019t do anything, then growth will be slower than it should be. Unemployment will not go down as fast as it should. Income inequality will continue to rise. Wages, incomes, savings rates for middle-class families will continue to be relatively flat. And that\u2019s not a future that we should accept. So the entire intention of the speech is to make sure that we are focused on the right thing. It doesn\u2019t mean that I expect Republicans to agree with all my prescriptions, but it is to say that the central problem we face and the one that we faced now that the immediate crisis is over is how do we build a broad-based prosperity. And I want to make sure that all of us in Washington are investing as much time, as much energy, as much debate on how we grow the economy and grow the middle class as we\u2019ve spent over the last two to three years arguing about how we reduce the deficits. NYT: But do you worry, Mr. President, that that description of that sort of standing pat, what happens if you stand pat and the sort of slower than expected -- do you worry that that could end up being your legacy simply because of the obstruction that -- and the gridlock that doesn\u2019t seem to end? MR. OBAMA: Well, let\u2019s separate it from me for a second, because I think if I\u2019m arguing for entirely different policies and Congress ends up pursuing policies that I think don\u2019t make sense and we get a bad result, it\u2019s hard to argue that\u2019d be my legacy. And so I\u2019ll worry about my legacy later or I\u2019ll let historians worry about my legacy. I do worry about what\u2019s happening to ordinary families here is Galesburg and all across the country. When we know that rebuilding our infrastructure right now would put people back to work and it\u2019s never been cheaper for us to do so, and this is all deferred maintenance that we\u2019re going to have to do at some point anyway, I worry that we\u2019re not moving faster to seize the moment. When we know that families are getting killed by college costs, for us not to take bold action -- which means that young people are graduating with massive debt, they can\u2019t buy a home as soon as they want, they can\u2019t start that business that they\u2019ve got a great idea for -- that worries me. So as I suggested in the speech, what I want to make sure everybody in Washington is obsessed with is how are we growing the economy, how are we increasing middle-class incomes and middle-class wages, and increasing middle-class security. And if we\u2019re not talking about that, then we\u2019re talking about the wrong thing. And if our debates around the budget don\u2019t have that in mind, then we\u2019ve got the wrong focus. NYT: Well, you said it yourself in the speech that Washington has taken its eye off the ball. Do you have any -- are you culpable at all in that? Did you -- it\u2019s six -- it\u2019s July now, it\u2019s almost August. Do you wish you were giving a speech like this earlier and done it more often? MR. OBAMA: If you look over the last six months, we right away delivered on the promise to make sure that our tax code was more reflective of our values; that middle-class families locked in relief that they needed; folks like me, at the very top, paid a little bit more. That, by the way, was a fundamental shift that was a decade in the making. That was a big argument. Immediately after that, obviously, we had the tragedy in Newtown and the need for a response. And my wish and hope had been that that was a quicker piece of business and that we had gone ahead and moved forward on that. Immigration reform actually squarely fits into what I\u2019m discussing right now. As I indicated before, we know the economy will grow faster if we get immigration reform done. We know that Social Security will be shored up if we get immigration reform done. And the Senate\u2019s done the right thing by passing a strong bipartisan bill. So what I will absolutely admit to is that I\u2019ve been here \u2013 I\u2019ve been in Washington long enough now to know that if once a week I\u2019m not talking about jobs, the economy, and the middle class, then all manner of distraction fills the void. NYT: Is there any part of your agenda moving forward that you think you are willing to move to the backburner so that you can spend more time on the economy? MR. OBAMA: Well, immigration reform we\u2019ve got to get done, and that right now is just a matter of the House Republicans recognizing that both the American people, businesses, labor, evangelicals -- there\u2019s a broad consensus to go ahead and pass that bill, and if that bill was on the floor tomorrow it would pass. Beyond that, though, we\u2019re working on a range of other issues -- from climate change to reforming government to reducing the backlog in the VA. So there\u2019s a bunch of stuff we\u2019re going to be doing. I will be spending my time over the next several weeks talking about the issues in more detail that I discussed today so that by the time Congress gets back in the fall, I want to make sure that the American people are paying attention and asking themselves, are we doing everything we can to boost middle-class incomes, ladders of opportunity, and middle-class security. And if we\u2019re doing that, then ultimately I think that we won\u2019t get everything done that I want to see done, but we will have shifted away from what I think has been a bad \u2013 a damaging framework in Washington, which is to constantly think about is there more we can do to cut the deficit without asking are we making the right cuts, the smart cuts that actually help people in their own lives and help us grow over the long term. NYT: Well, in contrast with the jobs plan that\u2019s now what you\u2019re reflecting today, it\u2019s almost two years old now, and which would measurably add to employment the studies show. MR. OBAMA: Right. NYT: But in contrast with that, the policies that have been in place since the start of your second term, fiscal policies -- MR. OBAMA: Right, because of the sequester. NYT: -- that you and Congress agreed to -- right -- and some of the laws -- the payroll tax cut, and the increase in upper-end taxes to some extent -- but all of those things are by any economist\u2019s measure a drag on the economy. There\u2019s not a day goes by I don\u2019t get some analyst saying that -- and that the Fed is pursuing expansionary policies to offset that. How can you -- how are you going to -- what exactly can you do between now and the end of the year to overcome the Republicans\u2019 opposition and change that, to end sequester? MR. OBAMA: Well, let me back up, Jackie. First of all, as the economy got stronger during the course of my presidency, I had always committed to a responsible reduction in the deficit. I think that was the smart thing to do, the right thing to do, and good for our growth. And if we\u2019re growing faster, if businesses and the markets have more confidence, then ultimately that benefits middle-class families as well. So I make no apologies for putting forward budgets consistently that, as I had promised, would gradually reduce the deficit. Now, the sequester I did not want to be in place. When you say I agreed to it, what happened, as you will recall, in 2011 is, is that we had the prospect of either default or a willingness on the part of Republicans and Democrats to spend a year and a half trying to come up with a sensible way to reduce the deficit. The sequester was supposed to be something that was so damaging to the economy that both parties would want to avoid it. The fact that Republicans embraced the sequester as what they consider a win during the course of this year, despite all the damage that they said they wanted to avoid, for example, to our military, is different from me agreeing to the sequester. All right? So that\u2019s point number one. Point number two, every economist will tell you that if we are being smart about growth and we\u2019re thinking about jobs and we\u2019re thinking about the middle class, but we\u2019re also thinking about fiscal responsibility, then what we should be doing is making sure that the drop-off in government spending on vital things like education and infrastructure don\u2019t go down too fast, and that rather we look at what the real problem is, which is long-term health care costs. Because of the Affordable Care Act and a lot of changes that are taking place out there among providers, we\u2019re starting to see health care costs slow. That\u2019s a positive. If we can build on that, then we can capture the same amount of savings that we\u2019re capturing through the sequester and use those to make sure that we\u2019re not cutting vital investments that I talked about today, and we can help middle-class families. Now, I think there are probably going to be 15 different ways for you guys to ask me the same question, which is, \u201cBut there\u2019s Congress.\u201d (Laughter.) More specifically, \u201cThere\u2019s the House Republicans, and what are you going to do about that?\u201d NYT: Who are still embracing sequestration and who are still willing to use the debt limit to go to the mat. MR. OBAMA: Well, this is what they say. On the other hand, we also have a number of very thoughtful and sensible Republicans over in the Senate who have said that we should not play brinksmanship, that we should come up with a long-term plan. I met with a couple of House Republicans over the last several weeks who would like to see that happen. They\u2019re not the loudest voices in the room at the moment. And part of what I\u2019d like to see over the next several weeks is, if we\u2019re having a conversation that\u2019s framed as how are we growing the economy, how are we strengthening the middle class, how are we putting people back to work, how are we making college more affordable, how are we bringing manufacturing back -- the answer to those questions I think force a different result than if we are constantly asking ourselves how can we cut the deficit more, faster, sooner. NYT: Have you yielded anything from your outreach to Republicans? And do you still have hope for a 10-year deal by the end of the year? MR. OBAMA: I think it\u2019s still possible. There are certainly Republicans who are deeply concerned about the effects of sequester. It\u2019s been interesting -- I\u2019ve talked to a number of them who are from deeply red states, consider themselves very conservative, who say it doesn\u2019t make sense for us to cut discretionary spending more; it doesn\u2019t make sense for us to cut education further -- because they\u2019re seeing the impacts in their districts. Certainly there are a bunch of Republicans who say for us to hollow out our military as steeply, drastically as we\u2019re doing if sequester stays in place for next year makes no sense. So if the American people have confidence that there\u2019s a path that will grow the economy faster, put more people back to work, that doesn\u2019t involve massive new federal spending programs, but instead just make sure that we\u2019re investing in the right things, and if we\u2019re being attentive to debt and deficits over a 20, 30-year time horizon, then potentially some of those Republicans start giving voice to their concerns a little more loudly than they\u2019re doing right now. But one of the challenges, as I said in the speech, is that there\u2019s almost a kneejerk habit right now that if I\u2019m for it, then they\u2019ve got to be against it. And I think there are a lot of Republicans who are frustrated by that, because they want to be for something, not just against something. But they\u2019ve got to work through that pattern that\u2019s developed over the last couple of years. NYT: A couple of slightly different topics. On the economy, the Fed is obviously an important player. You\u2019ve got a big decision ahead of yourself in terms of the chairman. What are you looking for in a chairman? And there were reports yesterday that you are very close to naming Larry Summers as the new Fed chairman. True? MR. OBAMA: I have not made a final decision. I\u2019ve narrowed it down to some extraordinarily qualified candidates. NYT: Do you want to say who? MR. OBAMA: No. (Laughter.) NYT: I tried. MR. OBAMA: And what I\u2019m looking for is somebody who understands the Fed has a dual mandate, that that\u2019s not just lip service; that it is very important to keep inflation in check, to keep our dollar sound, and to ensure stability in the markets. But the idea is not just to promote those things in the abstract. The idea is to promote those things in service of the lives of ordinary Americans getting better. And when unemployment is still too high, and long-term unemployment is still too high, and there\u2019s still weak demand in a lot of industries, I want a Fed chairman that can step back and look at that objectively and say, let\u2019s make sure that we\u2019re growing the economy, but let\u2019s also keep an eye on inflation, and if it starts heating up, if the markets start frothing up, let\u2019s make sure that we\u2019re not creating new bubbles. NYT: And do you have a timeline in mind for announcing that? MR. OBAMA: I think you can anticipate that over the next several months, an announcement will be made. Ben Bernanke, by the way, has done a fine job as Fed chairman. And when you look at Ben Bernanke\u2019s testimony, not just last week but over the last couple of years, what he\u2019s consistently said is right now, our priority needs to be growing the economy faster and strengthening incomes for ordinary Americans. If we do that, our deficits come down because we\u2019re bringing in more revenue. If we do that, it becomes easier for us to handle the long-term fiscal challenges. And one of the interesting things that we don\u2019t talk about enough is the contrast between what\u2019s happened in the United States and what\u2019s happened in a lot of other developing countries, Europe in particular. It's pretty rare where we have the chance to look at two policy approaches and follow them over several years and see which one worked. And the fact is there are a lot of European countries who followed the prescription that the House Republicans are calling for right now, and not only have they lagged well below where we've gone in terms of growth, in many cases their debt and their deficits have actually gone up because their economy is still effectively in recession. And although we haven\u2019t been growing as fast as we would like, we have consistently outperformed those countries that followed the recipe that the House Republicans are offering right now. Now, I\u2019m more sympathetic to those European countries because they, in some cases, didn\u2019t have a choice. They don\u2019t have the dominant world currency. They don\u2019t have people who want to invest in their countries the way folks around the world still want to invest in ours. But in some ways, we've got evidence here. This is not an abstract argument. We know what's needed to make our economy grow right now. And if we grow our economy, and middle-class families are doing better, and housing prices are stronger, and young people are starting families of their own and they\u2019re jobs at good wages, that\u2019s the thing that will bring deficits down the fastest. NYT: A couple other quick subjects that are economic-related. Keystone pipeline -- Republicans especially talk about that as a big job creator. You've said that you would approve it only if you could be assured it would not significantly exacerbate the problem of carbon in the atmosphere. Is there anything that Canada could do or the oil companies could do to offset that as a way of helping you to reach that decision? MR. OBAMA: Well, first of all, Michael, Republicans have said that this would be a big jobs generator. There is no evidence that that\u2019s true. And my hope would be that any reporter who is looking at the facts would take the time to confirm that the most realistic estimates are this might create maybe 2,000 jobs during the construction of the pipeline -- which might take a year or two -- and then after that we\u2019re talking about somewhere between 50 and 100 [chuckles] jobs in a economy of 150 million working people. NYT: Yet there are a number of unions who want you to approve this. MR. OBAMA: Well, look, they might like to see 2,000 jobs initially. But that is a blip relative to the need. So what we also know is, is that that oil is going to be piped down to the Gulf to be sold on the world oil markets, so it does not bring down gas prices here in the United States. In fact, it might actually cause some gas prices in the Midwest to go up where currently they can\u2019t ship some of that oil to world markets. Now, having said that, there is a potential benefit for us integrating further with a reliable ally to the north our energy supplies. But I meant what I said; I'm going to evaluate this based on whether or not this is going to significantly contribute to carbon in our atmosphere. And there is no doubt that Canada at the source in those tar sands could potentially be doing more to mitigate carbon release. NYT: And if they did, could that offset the concerns about the pipeline itself? MR. OBAMA: We haven't seen specific ideas or plans. But all of that will go into the mix in terms of John Kerry\u2019s decision or recommendation on this issue. NYT: And then -- I\u2019ll let Jackie go -- but on the employer mandate, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve been asked the question directly why you made the decision to delay it, and whether, given your criticism of President Bush over the years for potentially exceeding his executive authority, there\u2019s been a lot of folks out there on the Republican side who claim that somehow you\u2019ve exceeded your authority on this. Is there anything to that? MR. OBAMA: Well, this was a very practical decision that actually doesn\u2019t go to the heart of us implementing the Affordable Care Act. The majority of employers in this country provide health insurance to their employees. And the number of employers who are potentially subject to the employer mandate is relatively small. The way the law was originally written, it did not take into account the fact that we don\u2019t necessarily need to load up the vast majority of companies that are already doing the right thing with a bunch of additional paperwork; are there simpler ways for us to allow them to certify that they\u2019re providing health insurance? And if they do that, then the purpose, the spirit of the law is met, and we can concentrate on the few bad actors who are unwilling to provide health insurance to their employees even though they can afford it, and they\u2019re relatively large employers. And businesses came to us and said, listen, we were supportive of providing health insurance to employees, in fact, we provide health insurance to our employees; we understand you want to get at the bad actors here, but are there ways to provide us some administrative relief? And what we said was, given that that is not critical to standing up the marketplaces where people are going to actually be able to buy lower-cost, high-quality insurance and get the tax credits that make it affordable for them, we thought it made sense to give another year not only for companies to prepare, but also for us to work with Treasury and others to see if there are just ways we can make this a little bit simpler for companies who are already doing the right thing. This is the kind of routine modifications or tweaks to a large program that\u2019s starting off that in normal times in a normal political atmosphere would draw a yawn from everybody. The fact that something like this generates a frenzy on Republicans is consistent with the fact that they've voted to repeal this thing 38 times without offering a alternative that is plausible. And from what I understand, based on recent reporting, they\u2019ve just given up on offering an alternative. So essentially -- their central economic plan that they\u2019re currently presenting involves making sure that 50 million Americans cannot get health insurance; that people with preexisting conditions are potentially locked out of the market; that the rebates that people have received from insurance companies are sent back; that young people who are right now on their parents\u2019 plan because they\u2019re 26 or under, that they suddenly don\u2019t have health insurance. I do not understand the argument that that somehow grows the economy or strengthens the middle class. And during the course of implementation, are there going to be some glitches? Are there going to be some complaints from employers who are still trying to figure it out and may not know what subsidies are available to them? Absolutely. Are there some folks who may say, we're going to try to figure out ways not to provide health insurance to our employees? Yes. But that\u2019s a small proportion of our overall economy, and the principle that everybody should be able to get health insurance is one that the vast majority of Americans agree with. NYT: People questioned your legal and constitutional authority to do that unilaterally -- to delay the employer mandate. Did you consult with your lawyer? MR. OBAMA: Jackie, if you heard me on stage today, what I said was that I will seize any opportunity I can find to work with Congress to strengthen the middle class, improve their prospects, improve their security -- NYT: No, but specifically \u2013 MR. OBAMA: -- but where Congress is unwilling to act, I will take whatever administrative steps that I can in order to do right by the American people. And if Congress thinks that what I\u2019ve done is inappropriate or wrong in some fashion, they\u2019re free to make that case. But there\u2019s not an action that I take that you don't have some folks in Congress who say that I'm usurping my authority. Some of those folks think I usurp my authority by having the gall to win the presidency. And I don't think that's a secret. But ultimately, I\u2019m not concerned about their opinions -- very few of them, by the way, are lawyers, much less constitutional lawyers. I am concerned about the folks who I spoke to today who are working really hard, are trying to figure out how they can send their kids to college, are trying to make sure that they can save for their retirement. And if I can take steps on their behalf, then I\u2019m going to do so. And I would hope that more and more of Congress will say, you know what, since that\u2019s our primary focus, we\u2019re willing to work with you to advance those ideals. But I\u2019m not just going to sit back if the only message from some of these folks is no on everything, and sit around and twiddle my thumbs for the next 1,200 days. NYT: Polls this week have shown your health care law has lost support. What are you going to be doing to build support? MR. OBAMA: We\u2019re going to implement it. NYT: Are you going to be getting out on the road? MR. OBAMA: Here is what will build support, given that we\u2019ve been outspent four to one from the other side with all kinds of distortions about health care. Here is what we\u2019re going to do to beat back that misinformation. On October 1st, people are going to be able to start signing up. And if right now they\u2019re buying insurance on the individual market, they\u2019re going to get on those computers or they\u2019re going to make a phone call to one of these call centers and they\u2019re going to find out that they can save 20 percent, 30 percent, or 50 percent on their premiums. And people who have not been able to get insurance before are going to be able to finally get insurance. And people who lose their jobs in the interim and find out that they\u2019ve got a preexisting condition, it\u2019s hard for them to get insurance or they can\u2019t afford COBRA, they\u2019re going to have a place to go. And over the course of six months to a year, as people sign up, and it works, and lo and behold, the people who already have health insurance are not being impacted at all other than the fact that their insurance is more secure and they are getting free preventive care, and all the nightmare scenarios and the train wrecks and the \u201csky is falling\u201d predictions that come from the other side do not happen, then health care will become more popular. But until then, when we\u2019re getting outspent four to one and people are just uncertain about what all this means for them, we\u2019re going to continue to have some polls like that. And me just making more speeches explaining it in and of itself won\u2019t do it. The test of this is going to be is it working. And if it works, it will be pretty darn popular. NYT: March on Washington coming up soon. Are you going to do anything to mark it? Are you planning on being a part of the 50th anniversary? MR. OBAMA: Absolutely. It\u2019s obviously a historic, seminal event in the country. It\u2019s part of my generation\u2019s formative memory and it\u2019s a good time for us to do some reflection. Obviously, after the Trayvon Martin case, a lot of people have been thinking about race, but I always remind people -- and, in fact, I have a copy of the original program in my office, framed -- that that was a march for jobs and justice; that there was a massive economic component to that. When you think about the coalition that brought about civil rights, it wasn\u2019t just folks who believed in racial equality; it was people who believed in working folks having a fair shot. It was Walter Reuther and the UAW coming down here because they understood that if there are some workers who are not getting a fair deal then ultimately that\u2019s going to undercut their ability to get a fair deal. And if there\u2019s one thing that I wanted to try to emphasize today in this speech, it is that America has always worked better when everybody has a chance to succeed. I had a conversation a couple of weeks back with a guy named Robert Putnam, who I\u2019ve known for a long time. NYT: He was my professor actually at Harvard. MR. OBAMA: Right. I actually knew Bob when I was a state senator and he had put together this seminar to just talk about some of the themes that he had written about in \u201cBowling Alone,\u201d the weakening of the community fabric and the impact it\u2019s having on people. And the work he\u2019s doing right now has to do with this issue of inequality. And it applies to a city like Galesburg, where 30 years ago, anybody in this town who wanted to find a job, they could go get a job. They could go get it at the Maytag plant. They could go get it with the railroad. It might be hard work, it might be tough work, but they could buy a house with it. The kids here all went to the same school -- the banker\u2019s kid and the guy working at the Maytag plant\u2019s going to the same school. They've got the same social support. College is affordable for all of them. They don't have to take out $100,000 of debt to do it. And there was a sense of not upward mobility in the abstract; it was part and parcel of who we were as Americans. And that\u2019s what\u2019s been eroding over the last 20, 30 years, well before the financial crisis. Now, the financial crisis made things a lot worse. And so I had to spend the first four years in my presidency getting us back to ground level. We had to make sure the banking system wasn't collapsing. We had to make sure the auto industry didn't collapse. We had to make sure that we put people back to work short term and boosted demand until the markets got going and consumers got more confident and housing started to recover. And so here we are, having dealt with this massive crisis, but those trends -- that erosion of what a Galesburg or a [Port]* Clinton, Ohio, where Bob Putnam lived -- those trends have continued. And that\u2019s what people sense. That's why people are anxious. That's why people are frustrated. That's what they talk to me about and that's what they write to me about: \u201cI'm doing okay right now, but what I've seen over the last 20 years and what I learned profoundly during this crisis is that the ground under my feet just isn't as secure, and that the work I'm doing may not be rewarded.\u201d And everything that I am proposing and everything I will be proposing over the next three years goes right at that issue. And if that\u2019s not what Washington\u2019s talking about, then we will be missing the boat. And racial tensions won\u2019t get better; they may get worse, because people will feel as if they\u2019ve got to compete with some other group to get scraps from a shrinking pot. If the economy is growing, everybody feels invested. Everybody feels as if we're rolling in the same direction. And so a lot of the other issues that we\u2019re talking about -- whether it\u2019s climate change or immigration, or how we manage our trade relations -- all those are eased if we\u2019ve got our economic act together. But that\u2019s not what we talk about. And it's true that Congress moves at such a glacial pace these days that sometimes if you start a bill like immigration and you're thinking this should be done by now, it seems to take a year of folks just sitting around spinning their wheels, that can be frustrating. But we should be able to attend to some of these other issues even as we\u2019re staying focused on this central issue. That\u2019s at least what I\u2019m going to be doing. NYT: Thank you, Mr. President. MR. OBAMA: Thanks, guys. Appreciate you.",

      "author": "Katie Glueck",
      "content": " SUMTER, S.C. \u2014 After spending weeks under fire for his decades-long history on race and civil rights, Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Saturday gave the most forceful defense yet of his record, emphasizing his time as vice president to Barack Obama, and did something he had resisted in the past \u2014 apologize for warmly reminiscing about his working relationships with Southern segregationists. Mr. Biden, who previously had been defiant about those remarks and is often reluctant to issue apologies for his past positions, told a heavily African-American audience gathered in South Carolina, a crucial early-voting state, that he regretted those comments, which had incited backlash from many Democrats. He also used his speech to draw contrasts with some of the candidates in the Democratic presidential primary who are to his left, and to defend his broader philosophy of working \u201cwithin the system\u201d to \u201cget things done for the least among us,\u201d even when that means dealing, he said, \u201cwith those who we find repugnant.\u201d \u201cNow, was I wrong a few weeks ago to somehow give the impression to people that I was praising those men who I successfully opposed time and again?\u201d he said. \u201cYes, I was. I regret it. I\u2019m sorry for any of the pain and misconception I may have caused anybody.\u201d The room broke into applause, drowning out Mr. Biden. But, he asked the crowd, should \u201cthat misstep define 50 years of my record for fighting for civil rights, racial justice in this country?\u201d \u201cI hope not,\u201d he said, as some in the crowd murmured \u201cno.\u201d Mr. Biden added: \u201cI don\u2019t think so. That just isn\u2019t an honest assessment of my record.\u201d The remarks came during Mr. Biden\u2019s first public event of a weekend trip to South Carolina, a state with a heavily African-American Democratic electorate, where Mr. Obama is beloved. It is a state where Mr. Biden has enjoyed significant good will tied to his time in the Obama administration. And his visit comes amid recent scrutiny of his civil rights record and slipping national poll numbers following his first Democratic debate of the 2020 primary season and its heated exchanges over busing and race. On Saturday, before a crowd that appeared sympathetic and often enthusiastic, Mr. Biden sought to put his record on issues like the 1994 Crime Bill \u2014 which many associate with mass incarceration \u2014 or his dealings with segregationist lawmakers, in what he cast as historical context. He argued that throughout his career he was simply being pragmatic, an approach he continues to embrace even as many of his opponents suggest it is not possible to negotiate with today\u2019s Republican Party. \u201cEverything they stood for offended me,\u201d he said of the segregationists, who were largely Southern Democrats. \u201cThey represented everything that I ran against. It would have been nice if the day President Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act, they and everything they stood for had been removed from the Senate, and from the political landscape of America. That\u2019s not the real world.\u201d He also worked to focus attention on his time serving under Mr. Obama. \u201cIt\u2019s as if my opponents want you to believe I served from 1972 until 2008 \u2014 and then took a hiatus for the next eight years,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to talk much about my time as vice president of the United States.\u201d \u201cI was vetted by he and 10 serious lawyers he appointed\u201d to look at \u201cevery single thing\u201d in his record, \u201cfrom finances to anything I had done, everything,\u201d Mr. Biden said of Mr. Obama. \u201cAnd he selected me. I\u2019ll take his judgment about my record, my character, my ability to handle the job over anyone else\u2019s.\u201d [The latest data and analysis to keep track of who\u2019s leading the race to be the Democratic nominee.] For weeks, Mr. Biden\u2019s aides had watched in frustration as much of the conversation around the former vice president had centered not on his time in the administration \u2014 which is how voters know him best \u2014 but on controversies dating to the 1970s. Mr. Biden had brought up those relationships with segregationists  as he fondly recalled what he characterized as a more civil time in the Senate at a fund-raiser last month. He has a habit of telling stories that date back decades, and that can sometimes sound off-key in today\u2019s more progressive Democratic Party. But the speech was a new effort to focus on a more forward-looking message, after spending the Fourth of July in Iowa locked in a back-and-forth with Senator Kamala Harris of California over the issue of federally mandated busing. \u201cI know that many want this campaign to be about my past,\u201d he said. \u201cI get it. That\u2019s the game. But this isn\u2019t a game. Every one of you know, no matter who you\u2019re for, know in your bones, this election is different.\u201d Some in the friendly audience made clear they were not interested in relitigating Mr. Biden\u2019s record on race, even though the issue remains of significant importance to many in the party, including to some younger people of color. \u201cI thought her comments were unnecessary and out of place,\u201d said Irvin Williams, 81, of Ms. Harris\u2019s comments about Mr. Biden\u2019s record on busing. He and his wife, who are African-American, said they were deciding between Mr. Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. \u201cIf he said it, it\u2019s how many years ago? If that was his position, then so be it. He\u2019s done a lot of good things for people in this country.\u201d Eloise Conyers, who turns 64 on Sunday, said she was leaning toward Mr. Biden \u201cfor now,\u201d but also likes Ms. Harris. \u201cI support her point of view,\u201d Ms. Conyers said, adding that Mr. Biden did not \u201caddress it effectively\u201d in the debate. But, she said, \u201cI know from his record and what he has done, he really supports equal rights for others.\u201d [We tracked down the 2020 Democrats and asked them the same set of questions. Watch them answer.] Mr. Biden also made clear that in contrast to some of his more liberal opponents, who support eliminating private health insurance in favor of more expansive government-supported health care coverage, he is not calling for revolutionary change on issues like the Affordable Care Act, noting his support for a public option. It was an implicit contrast with those who would support bolder change as part of proposals like \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d and a sign of his increased willingness to engage with his opponents rather than keeping his focus on President Trump. \u201cWe don\u2019t have time,\u201d he said of those who want to \u201cstart over.\u201d At least one rival campaign is already signaling that it does not plan to let Mr. Biden move on from his past so easily. \u201cEvery candidate\u2019s record will (and should) be scrutinized in this race,\u201d tweeted Ian Sams, the national press secretary for Ms. Harris. \u201cIt\u2019s a competition to become President of the United States. There are no free passes.\u201d",

      "author": "Linda Qiu",
      "content": " President Trump on Thursday backed away from efforts to add a question about citizenship to the 2020 census after insisting that he would press on despite a Supreme Court ruling that the administration had not provided an adequate reason for including the question. Throughout his fight, a number of prominent conservative voices and members of his staff have amplified an inaccurate talking point that former President Barack Obama had eliminated the question. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Mr. Trump\u2019s former press secretary, was among the first to give the claim a wide audience when she said in March 2018 that the question had \u201cbeen included in every census since 1965, with the exception of 2010, when it was removed.\u201d At the time, 12 states had sued the Trump administration for trying to add the question. As courts weighed in on the case and after the Supreme Court ruled against Mr. Trump, others began to echo the claim blaming Mr. Obama, including Charlie Kirk, the founder of the pro-Trump group Turning Point USA; Chuck Woolery, the game show host; the Gateway Pundit, a pro-Trump blog; an anchor on One America News, a pro-Trump news network; a spokesman for the Trump campaign; and Representative Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina. Despite tens thousands of retweets on social media and repetition on Fox News, these claims are inaccurate. A citizenship question has appeared in some form on different census surveys since 1820, and Mr. Obama was not responsible for its omission from the decennial census. Moreover, the Census Bureau has not stopped inquiring about citizenship. In 1940, households surveyed in the decennial census were directly asked about citizenship. A decade later, census takers asked respondents about place of birth and followed up with a question about citizenship as part of one inquiry. The citizenship question was dropped in 1960 from the general census except in New York and Puerto Rico. In 1970, most households were not asked about citizenship, though 15 percent of respondents were asked about birthplace and 5 percent if they were citizens. The short-form census sent to most households did not ask about citizenship in 1980, 1990 and 2000, but the question was relegated to a longer version sent to a smaller portion of households. In 2010, under Mr. Obama, the Census Bureau stopped distributing the long-form questionnaire altogether \u2014 and the citizenship question along with it. But that\u2019s because the bureau began using an alternative survey in 2005 that also included the question. It\u2019s also clear that the Obama administration did not instigate efforts to replace the long-form questionnaire with the American Community Survey. Plans to do so began years earlier. After years of testing, a series of government reports from 2002 to 2004 concluded that the American Community Survey, a separate questionnaire surveying a monthly sample of households, produced virtually the same estimates as the census long-form questionnaire. And in 2005, the survey was fully put into place. \u201cTo deal with some of these challenges at the beginning of the decade, the 2010 census was re-engineered to build a better, faster and simpler census. The plan was to leverage technology, eliminate the long form and conduct a short-form-only decennial census,\u201d Carlos Gutierrez, the commerce secretary under former President George W. Bush, testified to Congress in April 2008. The American Community Survey continues to ask about citizenship, among other topics, to this day. Curious about the accuracy of a claim?

      "author": "Peter Baker",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 America stinks. At least that\u2019s what Donald J. Trump seemed to be saying before becoming president. He did not believe in \u201cAmerican exceptionalism,\u201d he said, because America was not exceptional. Instead, it was a \u201claughingstock\u201d that was no better than Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s Russia. By promising to make America great again, he made it clear that he believed it was not great anymore. That was then. Now the president who trash-talked America more than any other in modern times says anyone who trash-talks America should leave. The president, who took office with an inaugural address decrying \u201cAmerican carnage,\u201d now says that it is unpatriotic to speak ill of the country. And on Tuesday, he went further, equating attacks on him by his political opponents with attacks on \u201cthe Country, the Flag.\u201d The love-it-or-leave-it argument is hardly new, but in recent years, it has rarely played out at the volume and level it has since Mr. Trump on Sunday told a group of liberal, first-year Democratic congresswomen of color to \u201cgo back\u201d to their home countries, even though three of the four were born in the United States. Assailed for inflaming racial divisions, Mr. Trump this week sought to reframe his attack on the so-called squad of congresswomen into a question of patriotism and loyalty, claiming that they \u201chate our country.\u201d The blistering debate that has followed is all the more remarkable given that Mr. Trump spent much of the last few years essentially disparaging America. It was the high-octane fuel for his campaign, the notion that this was no longer the United States of old because it had succumbed to politically correct, multicultural, open-borders globalism and allowed itself to be taken advantage of by allies and adversaries alike. As president, however, Mr. Trump has wrapped himself in the flag \u2014 at one point hugging it at a conservative political gathering \u2014 and waged a monthslong campaign against African-American football players for protesting racism by kneeling during the national anthem. He effectively co-opted the national celebration of the Fourth of July, making himself the red-white-and-blue star on center stage. He has contended that he has transformed the United States into a beacon of strength again, crediting himself with reversing the national decline he identified as a candidate. \u201cAs president, he now sees America as an avatar for himself \u2014 it must be great because he\u2019s great,\u201d said Nicole Hemmer, a scholar of conservatism who is taking a position at Columbia University to work on its oral history of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency. \u201cFrom this perspective, to allow that America has faults would be to allow that Trump himself has them, something he has never been willing to do.\u201d In a way, this is a struggle over what the United States really stands for. Mr. Trump and his allies argue that the squad and its followers do not share core American values because they are critical of the system and advocate or flirt with socialism, while the president\u2019s critics say it\u2019s the other way around and that he does not subscribe to the core national beliefs in free speech, immigration and the rule of law. At stake is who gets to define what constitutes Americanism. There is no doubt that Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and her allies made provocative, even incendiary statements that have struck even many of their fellow Democrats as radical. Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota in particular has used anti-Semitic tropes to attack supporters of Israel and suggest Jewish lawmakers were loyal to a foreign country while making comments that seemed to minimize the horror of terrorism, even the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. The Republican National Committee on Tuesday issued a list of what it called the \u201cvile, hateful, anti-Israel and anti-American rhetoric\u201d used by Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, Ms. Omar and Representatives Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ayanna S. Pressley of Massachusetts, citing among other things comments attacking the Border Patrol and accusing the administration of running \u201cconcentration camps\u201d on the southeastern border. \u201cHe\u2019s tired, a lot of us are sick and tired of this country \u2014 of America \u2014 coming last to people who swore an oath of office,\u201d Kellyanne Conway, the president\u2019s counselor, told reporters at the White House on Tuesday. The squad\u2019s supporters argue that their comments were not anti-American but policy criticisms of an administration they disagree with, just as Mr. Trump\u2019s backers argue that his past remarks were not rejections of America but expressions of frustration with what he viewed as the damaging leadership of Mr. Obama and other presidents of both parties. Geoffrey R. Stone, a First Amendment scholar at the University of Chicago Law School who has studied the era of McCarthyism, said criticism of the government represents one of the greatest strengths of the United States. \u201cNot all criticisms are warranted, of course, but it is through such criticism that we improve over time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was criticism that led to the civil rights movement, the women\u2019s rights movement and the gay rights movement. The president should learn to value criticism, even when he disagrees with its message.\u201d Ben Domenech, a founder and publisher of The Federalist, a conservative online publication, said the debate of recent days reminded him of a \u201cSouth Park\u201d episode where the characters say that America has problems, but anyone who does not root for the home team should get out of the stadium. \u201cThe president is doing the same thing, with an added tinge of xenophobia,\u201d said Mr. Domenech. \u201cIt\u2019s tribal, it ramps up the intensity of everything, but it plays both in his interest and the interests of the congressional members involved from their perspective.\u201d Mr. Trump was less bothered by criticism of the United States in the years leading up to his election. He repeatedly said \u201cour country is a laughingstock\u201d and took issue with the term \u201cAmerican exceptionalism.\u201d In 2013, he praised Mr. Putin for an \u201camazing\u201d Op-Ed in The New York Times that said the United States was not special and criticized Mr. Obama for asserting American exceptionalism. Speaking on CNN, Mr. Trump said, \u201cYou think of the term as being fine, but all of a sudden you say, what if you\u2019re in Germany or Japan or any one of 100 different countries? You\u2019re not going to like that term. It\u2019s very insulting, and Putin really put it to him about that.\u201d As for whether Americans were exceptional, he said, \u201cWhy would we be?\u201d citing the disastrous Iraq war. He likewise rejected the term in 2016 as a presidential candidate when asked about his praise for Mr. Putin\u2019s Op-Ed. \u201cAnd that\u2019s basically what Putin was saying, is that, you know, you use a term like \u2018American exceptionalism,\u2019 and frankly, the way our country is being treated right now by Russia and Syria and lots of other places and with all the mistakes we\u2019ve made over the years, like Iraq and so many others, it\u2019s sort of a hard term to use,\u201d he said on Fox News. During other interviews, he has said the United States was no better than Russia when it came to its moral values on the international front. During a conversation with Bill O\u2019Reilly on Fox shortly after Mr. Trump took office, the host pointed out that \u201cPutin\u2019s a killer.\u201d Mr. Trump replied by saying, \u201cWhat, do you think our country is so innocent?\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s affinity for Russia was so pronounced during the campaign that Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, now the Republican leader in the House, privately told colleagues that \u201cI think Putin pays\u201d Mr. Trump. Last year, Mr. Trump blamed poor relations with Russia on \u201cmany years of U.S. foolishness and stupidity\u201d \u2014 to which the Russian Foreign Ministry then tweeted, \u201cWe agree.\u201d Asked on Sunday to reconcile Mr. Trump\u2019s latest love-America line with his repeated assertions that America needed to be made great again, and therefore was not great, Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for the president\u2019s re-election campaign, offered a variation on the slogan: \u201cKeep America great.\u201d",

And now he finds himself defending his ties to Barack Obama, whose legacy drew some criticism from other Democrats.By Jonathan Martin and Alexander BurnsPRINT EDITIONFront-Runner  In a Torn Party  Starts to Teeter|August 2, 2019, Page A1",
      "author": "Jonathan Martin",
      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 The two rounds of Democratic presidential debates, rather than bringing clarity to the primary or culling the field of 24 candidates, have instead laid bare the fragility of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. as a front-runner and showcased the divisions over ideology and identity in a party that appears united only in its desire to defeat President Trump. Having failed so far to dominate the debates, Mr. Biden tried on Thursday to quell liberal resistance to his candidacy by other means: He charged, in Detroit, that certain attacks from the left on his record and his policies amounted to attacks on former President Barack Obama and his legacy. After nearly 10 hours of nationally televised and often contentious candidate forums, the Democratic hopefuls and their voters are plainly torn over how best to take on Mr. Trump and how aggressive a program they should embrace, particularly on health care and immigration. And far from coalescing around a possible nominee, Democrats are also sharply divided over what kind of standard-bearer would best bridge the larger generational, gender and racial differences shaping the party in the 2020 race. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody is currently perceived as both appealing and low-risk,\u201d said Diane Feldman, a veteran Democratic pollster who said she saw Mr. Biden as having largely given up his advantage on the risk front. \u201cHe is still more moderate, he is still of a different generation and those things carry some advantages for him. But he may not still have the \u2018low-risk choice\u2019 advantage.\u201d Mr. Biden demonstrated his vulnerabilities in the two debates, repeatedly offering halting answers, though he performed better in Wednesday\u2019s forum than in the first one in June. But on the stage on Wednesday and at an event on Thursday in Detroit, he also adopted a new strategy: defending Mr. Obama from direct and implicit criticism from some of the other Democratic candidates, particularly Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York, and Juli\u00e1n Castro, a former housing secretary. Casting his liberal critics as generally hostile to the administration he served in, Mr. Biden said it was \u201cbizarre\u201d that some candidates were questioning the Obama administration\u2019s record on immigration and other issues, a defensive tactic to remind primary voters of his connection to a respected former president. Mr. Trump chimed in as well. \u201cThe Democrats spent more time attacking Barack Obama than they did attacking me, practically,\u201d he said during a Thursday night rally in Ohio. The rising tension over Mr. Obama\u2019s legacy, most notably the Affordable Care Act, is a new crack in the party\u2019s orthodoxy, as an ascendant progressive wing that favors transformative change raises questions about the incremental policies of the former president. After a few candidates used the Detroit debate to demand that Mr. Biden account for Mr. Obama\u2019s record on issues such as deportations and free trade, Mr. Biden was joined by some of the former president\u2019s advisers, who chastised the critics for committing political malpractice. \u201cThe more time we spend attacking President Obama and his record and the less time we spend on what Donald Trump is doing to this country only serves to help one person \u2014 Donald Trump,\u201d said Stephanie Cutter, a former top Obama campaign aide. \u201cEverybody on that stage needs to keep that in mind.\u201d David Axelrod, the architect of Mr. Obama\u2019s political ascent, said Mr. Biden would be wise to \u201clean in\u201d on his ties to the former president and to \u201cconfront those who are attacking the Obama policies.\u201d But Mr. Axelrod added that Mr. Biden and the other center-left candidates in the race have so far proved unable to make a compelling, affirmative case for what he called \u201ca reality-based candidacy\u201d that was at once uplifting and pragmatic. \u201cWe ran on \u2018yes we can,\u2019 and you\u2019re not going to win on \u2018no you can\u2019t,\u2019\u201d he said, recalling the Obama catchphrase. Ms. Feldman, the pollster, said that a number of Democratic candidates had begun to stand out from the field \u2014 including Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey \u2014 but that the overall trajectory of the race remained as fluid as ever. \u201cI think it may be a little less clear today than it was a week ago,\u201d she said. Among the liberal candidates, Ms. Warren demonstrated her formidable intellect and hard-charging populism at the debates, and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont made a full-throated claim to being the architect and chief promoter of ambitious liberal ideas. They delighted many progressives but also left the moderate wing of the party uneasy with their embrace of ideas like eliminating private health insurance, part of an uncompromising agenda the centrists fear will lead to electoral ruin. Still, the party\u2019s disagreements encompass more than ideology. There are the divisions of generation and identity, splitting candidates whose gender, race or age would make their presidency historic, like Ms. Harris, who would be the first woman to win. During the debate on Tuesday, it did not go unacknowledged that 40 years of age separated Mr. Sanders from Pete Buttigieg, 37, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., who would become the youngest president in history, while on Wednesday Mr. Biden repeatedly complained that his rivals were pillorying him for \u201cthings that occurred a long, long time ago.\u201d And there are strategic divisions as well, like the debate over whether to prioritize winning back the white voters of the Midwest or energizing African-Americans in cities across the region. In an implicit contrast with Mr. Biden and his focus on blue-collar whites, Mr. Booker described himself on Wednesday as uniquely suited to mobilizing black voters who could be decisive in states like Michigan. There is something else that alarms establishment Democrats: While Mr. Biden\u2019s grip on the race is clearly tenuous, no obvious, more compelling alternative has emerged from the center-left. And no one is yet in a position to displace Mr. Biden as the front-runner, or as the favorite of moderates and African-Americans. After surging in the polls and raising about $3 million online in the days after she confronted Mr. Biden in the first debate, Ms. Harris was unable to repeat her performance this week, momentarily confirming the skeptics\u2019 view that she is a lackluster political performer when speaking off the cuff. Mr. Booker had a stronger turn in Detroit, and was proclaimed the winner in many debate post-mortems, but he is facing significant fund-raising challenges and has already had to consolidate some of his staff. Numerous other would-be alternatives to the former vice president, like Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana and Mr. Buttigieg, have their admirers but have yet to catch fire with voters in the early nominating states. And while Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders electrified the left by stoutly defending their bold proposals on the debate stage, many in the party remain skeptical about their chances to defeat Mr. Trump. More worrisome to their two campaigns is that neither candidate has yet to demonstrate much appeal with African-American primary voters or, in Ms. Warren\u2019s case, working-class Democrats. \u201cThese debates have raised as many questions as they\u2019ve answered so far,\u201d said Ben LaBolt, a former spokesman for Mr. Obama. Part of the party\u2019s challenge is that Ms. Harris\u2019s viral moment on busing in June, and the higher threshold required to participate in the fall debates, encouraged candidates thirsty for higher poll numbers and more donors to go on the attack and to seek breakout moments. That has led to a stream of acrimonious challenges that sometimes bordered on grandstanding. Amid the tangle of ideological disputes and personal feuds that dominated the two rounds of debates, it fell at times to lower-profile candidates to exhort Democrats to focus on the bigger picture. Andrew Yang, a former tech executive, issued perhaps the most earnest plea, warning that the race was becoming an affair of \u201crehearsed attack lines\u201d with candidates \u201cplaying roles in this reality TV show.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s one reason why we elected a reality TV star as our president,\u201d Mr. Yang said, even as he unfurled a rehearsed line of his own. Not every Democrat is uneasy with a robust argument over the issues. Mayor Randall Woodfin of Birmingham, Ala., a progressive who attended the debate as a guest of Ms. Harris, said some of the disagreements in the party struck him as valuable, including the drawn-out and occasionally academic discussion of health care. On that subject, he said, there were \u201cactual differences\u201d on policy that merited airing out. Mr. Woodfin said policy alone would not decide his endorsement in the race. \u201cThe ability to win in the general election is equally important,\u201d he said, singling out Mr. Booker for his focus on that task. \u201cCory stayed above it, if I\u2019m being honest,\u201d Mr. Woodfin said. \u201cHe always brought it back to the general election and beating Trump.\u201d The race may now head into a long stretch of relative inactivity until the next major opportunity to reorder the contest: another round of televised debates in September, where fewer candidates are likely to muster the polling and financial support required. But some party officials do not want a repeat of the summer season in the fall. Voicing the impatience and anxiety of many Democrats, Representative Dan Kildee of Michigan said on Thursday that he planned to \u201cpush our candidates to stop\u2019\u201d the intraparty bickering \u201cand talk about the big issues that separate us from Donald Trump.\u201d \u201cTo pretend that we have these big, ideological differences, or to pretend that somehow, some of these candidates aren\u2019t credible messengers on income inequality or injustice \u2014 that\u2019s just not true,\u201d Mr. Kildee said. \u201cThere\u2019s a real danger when candidates\u2019 individual interests basically trump \u2014 I hate to use that term, but trump our mutual interests.\u201d Asked if he hoped Democrats would settle early on a nominee, Mr. Kildee offered a cold dose of realism: \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s likely to happen.\u201d",

      "content": " The politics of American gun violence follow a predictable pattern in most cases: outraged calls for action from the left, somber gestures of sympathy from the right, a subdued presidential statement delivered from a prepared text \u2014 and then, in a matter of days or even hours, a national turning of the page to other matters. But after a white supremacist gunman massacred 22 people in El Paso, the political world hurtled on Monday toward a more expansive, and potentially more turbulent, confrontation over racist extremism. Though the gun lobby was again on the defensive, it was not alone; so were social media companies and websites like 8chan that have become hives for toxic fantasies and violent ideas that have increasingly leaked into real life, with fatal consequences. Perhaps most of all, President Trump faced intense new criticism and scrutiny for the plain echoes of his own rhetoric in the El Paso gunman\u2019s anti-immigrant manifesto. Mr. Trump\u2019s usual methods of deflection sputtered on Monday: His early-morning tweets attacking the news media and calling vaguely for new background checks on gun purchasers did little to ease the political pressure. A midmorning statement he recited from the White House \u2014 condemning \u201cwhite supremacy\u201d and warning of internet-fueled extremism, but declining to address his own past language or call for stern new gun regulations \u2014 did nothing to quiet the chorus of censure from Mr. Trump\u2019s political opponents and critics, who are demanding presidential accountability. [Read our live briefing for the latest updates on the Dayton and El Paso shootings] No moment better captured how the gun violence debate was giving way to a reckoning on extremism than a statement on Monday afternoon from former President Barack Obama. Mr. Obama, who has weighed in sparingly on public events since leaving office, called both for gun control and for an emphatic national rejection of racism and the people who stoke it. \u201cWe should soundly reject language coming out of the mouths of any of our leaders that feeds a climate of fear and hatred or normalizes racist sentiments,\u201d Mr. Obama wrote, \u201cleaders who demonize those who don\u2019t look like us, or suggest that other people, including immigrants, threaten our way of life, or refer to other people as subhuman, or imply that America belongs to just one certain type of people.\u201d Mr. Obama did not mention Mr. Trump or any other leaders by name. The Democrats seeking the presidency in 2020 did not hesitate to do so: Mr. Trump had scarcely finished speaking from the White House on Monday when his Democratic challengers blamed him explicitly for giving succor to extremists. Joseph R. Biden Jr., the former vice president and current Democratic front-runner, accused Mr. Trump on Twitter of having used the presidency \u201cto encourage and embolden white supremacy.\u201d And in an interview with CNN, Mr. Biden said Mr. Trump had \u201cjust flat abandoned the theory that we are one people.\u201d [Sign up for our politics newsletter and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race.] Other political leaders reacted with their own raw distress and alarm. Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor who has bankrolled a yearslong crusade for gun control, wrote in a column that the \u201cnew atrocities need to change the political dynamic\u201d around guns, and said Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks were little more than \u201cthe usual dodge.\u201d [One man will decide Washington\u2019s response to gun violence: Mitch McConnell.] And Democratic presidential candidates rounded on Mr. Trump in a front that transcended ideological and tonal divisions in the party. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a populist liberal, said Mr. Trump must be held responsible for \u201camplifying these deadly ideologies,\u201d while Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, who has campaigned as an advocate for racial justice and national healing, derided Mr. Trump\u2019s speech as a \u201cbullshit soup of ineffective words\u201d in a text message that his campaign manager posted on Twitter. An aide to Mr. Booker said he would deliver a major speech on gun violence on Wednesday morning in South Carolina, at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston where a white supremacist gunman killed nine people in 2015. And the entwined issues of gun violence and racist extremism began to tumble into elections for offices well beyond the presidency. In Colorado, Mike Johnston, a former state lawmaker and gun-control advocate who is challenging Senator Cory Gardner, a Republican, blamed Mr. Trump for having \u201ccreated this toxic culture that incites white nationalists.\u201d In 2020, he said, candidates would have to make a stark binary choice. \u201cEither you\u2019re on the side of the white nationalist holding the AR-15, or you\u2019re on the side of the millions of Americans living in fear of them,\u201d Mr. Johnston said in an interview. Mr. Trump, for his part, said he was open to \u201cbipartisan solutions\u201d that would address gun violence, and blamed \u201cthe internet and social media\u201d for spreading what he termed \u201csinister ideologies.\u201d He was not specific about any next steps his administration would take, though he stressed his strong support for the death penalty and seemed to express skepticism that gun restrictions would be an appropriate remedy. \u201cMental illness and hatred pulls the trigger, not the gun,\u201d Mr. Trump said. Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign responded to criticism of the president with a statement deploring Democrats for \u201cpoliticizing a moment of national grief.\u201d \u201cThe president clearly condemned racism, bigotry and white supremacy as he has repeatedly,\u201d said Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign. \u201cHe also called for concrete steps to prevent such violent attacks in the future.\u201d Mr. Murtaugh added that \u201cno one blamed Bernie Sanders\u201d when one of his supporters attempted to kill a group of Republican lawmakers at a Virginia baseball diamond in 2017. \u201cThe responsibility for such horrific attacks,\u201d he said, \u201clies ultimately with the people who carry them out.\u201d If Mr. Trump and his allies are adamant that he is blameless in the rise of extremist violence, much of the public believes he has not adequately separated himself from white supremacists. A survey published in March by the Pew Research Center found that a majority of Americans \u2014 56 percent \u2014 said Mr. Trump had done \u201ctoo little to distance himself from white nationalist groups.\u201d That group included about a quarter of people who identified themselves as Republicans or as leaning toward Mr. Trump\u2019s party. It has not only been liberals who have argued that the mass shooting in El Paso, and another one hours later in Dayton, Ohio, represented a crisis for the country, and a major test for Mr. Trump. The conservative magazine National Review published an editorial on Sunday evening calling on Americans and their government to take on \u201ca murderous and resurgent ideology \u2014 white supremacy\u201d in much the same way the government has confronted Islamic terrorism. Mr. Trump, the magazine said, \u201cshould take the time to condemn these actions repeatedly and unambiguously, in both general and specific terms.\u201d Frank Keating, the former Republican governor of Oklahoma, who led his state through the 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City by domestic terrorists, said in an interview that the moment called for both new restrictions on firearms and a new tone from the White House. He urged Mr. Trump to \u201ccarefully choose your words\u201d to avoid instilling fear or inciting anger. \u201cHe needs to realize the lethality of his rhetoric,\u201d Mr. Keating said. \u201cThe truth is, the president is the secular pope,\u201d he added, \u201cand he needs to be a moral leader as well as a government leader, and to say that this must not occur again \u2014 exclamation mark.\u201d It was not clear whether the El Paso shooting had the potential to become a pivot point in national politics, much as the Oklahoma City bombing had in the 1990s. After that attack, which killed 168 people, President Bill Clinton delivered a searing speech against the \u201cloud and angry voices in America today whose sole goal seems to be to try to keep some people as paranoid as possible\u201d \u2014 a denunciation widely understood as being aimed at the extreme right. Mr. Clinton\u2019s handling of the attack helped restore voters\u2019 confidence in him as a strong leader after a shaky start to his presidency. [International readers reacted with frustration and despair to the recent mass shootings.] Mr. Trump has shown no inclination in the past to play a role of such clarifying moral leadership, or to engage in any kind of searching introspection about his own embrace of the politics of anger and racial division. In the aftermath of a white supremacist march in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017 that resulted in the murder of a young woman, Mr. Trump said there had been \u201cvery fine people on both sides\u201d of the unrest there. In recent weeks, he has engaged without apology in a sequence of attacks on prominent members of racial minority groups, including five different Democratic members of Congress. While few Republican lawmakers had anything critical to say about Mr. Trump in public after the El Paso and Dayton shootings, the party harbors profound private anxieties about the impact of his conduct on the 2020 elections. During last year\u2019s midterm elections, Mr. Trump campaigned insistently on a slashing message about illegal immigration, and was rewarded with a sweeping rejection of his party across the country\u2019s diverse cities and prosperous suburbs. Punctuating the final weeks of the 2018 elections were a pair of traumatic events that may have deepened voters\u2019 feelings of dismay about the president\u2019s violent language and appeals to racism: a failed wave of attempted bombings by a Trump supporter aimed at the president\u2019s critics, and a mass shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, carried out by a gunman who had railed about immigrant \u201cinvaders.\u201d Mr. Trump responded to the Pittsburgh massacre in a tone similar to the one he used on Monday, lamenting the \u201cterrible, terrible thing, what\u2019s going on with hate in our country,\u201d before taking up his caustic message again on the campaign trail. He paid no price for that approach with his largely rural and white political base, which has remained fiercely supportive of his administration through all manner of adversity, error and scandal. In the Democratic presidential race, the weekend of bloodshed had the effect of muting, at least temporarily, the divisions in the party that were showcased in last week\u2019s debates. The outbreak of solidarity may not last, but it underscored how much the 2020 campaign is likely to take shape in reaction to Mr. Trump\u2019s worldview and behavior. Even as they aired their disagreements last week, some Democrats appeared to recognize that political reality. In fact, on the morning after his party\u2019s back-to-back debates concluded, Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington State predicted to a reporter in Detroit that his party would have little difficulty rallying together in the 2020 election. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the most unifying gravitational force, outside of a black hole,\u201d Mr. Inslee remarked, \u201cand that\u2019s a white nationalist in the White House.\u201d",

      "author": "Katie Glueck",
      "content": "  LAS VEGAS \u2014 Former Housing Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro insisted that on immigration matters, \u201cthere\u2019s no comparison between Obama and Trump, O.K.?\u201d In response to a reporter\u2019s question, Senator Elizabeth Warren only briefly acknowledged past disagreements with the Obama administration before pivoting to praise former President Barack Obama\u2019s achievements on health care and protecting consumers. And Representative Seth Moulton of Massachusetts, who did not qualify for this past week\u2019s debates, swiped at some of his opponents who made the stage, saying they tried to \u201ctear down the Obama legacy to try to have a viral moment to qualify for the next debate.\u201d [Six things we learned from the July Democratic debates.] After several of the presidential candidates were critical of some policies overseen by Mr. Obama, who has a 90 percent approval rating among Democrats, at the debates in Detroit, the tone was strikingly different Saturday at the candidates\u2019 first major gathering since then. Along with courting union members at the forum, which drew 19 candidates to the conference of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees in Las Vegas, candidates also made clear that they had no interest in going after Mr. Obama, whether or not they embraced all of his policies. The result was a gathering that combined all the trappings of a major Democratic cattle call, old-style pro-union Democratic populism and a jolt of shock, sorrow and anger as news of a mass shooting in El Paso, Tex., trickled out, which would come to dominate the later hours of the forum. \u201cA lot of injury, a lot of suffering in El Paso right now,\u201d said former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke, his voice cracking as he discussed his hometown before cutting his Nevada trip short to return there. \u201cEl Paso is the strongest place in the world. This community\u2019s going to come together. I\u2019m going back there right now to be with my family and to be with my hometown.\u201d Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., began his remarks with the forceful declaration, \u201cAmerica is under attack. America is under attack from homegrown white nationalist terrorism.\u201d And Senator Kamala Harris of California linked the public services employees in attendance to those who would be responding in Texas. \u201cIt is you who do all the work and is going to do the responsive work about the shooting of El Paso,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s about the county workers, it\u2019s about state workers, it\u2019s about public service and it\u2019s about first responders.\u201d Several of the candidates who spoke earlier in the day would go on to deliver emotional appeals for combating gun violence in later statements, including former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who said he had tried to reach Mr. O\u2019Rourke. Earlier, he set the tone for the pro-Obama messaging in his AFSCME appearance Saturday morning. Mr. Biden, who has a habit of going on tangents and fumbling his lines, gave among the most fluent and forceful remarks of his candidacy as he vigorously defended the Affordable Care Act, Mr. Obama\u2019s signature health care law, and advocated for strengthening it, rather than embracing a new system \u2014 like, he implied, Medicare for All. \u201cWe should be building on Obamacare, we should not scrap Obamacare,\u201d he said, rising to his feet as he addressed a cheering crowd. He also defended the Obama administration\u2019s record on health care and immigration, something he would continue to do, fiercely and energetically, throughout two other stops on Saturday, though speaking at AFSCME, he stopped short of accusing his opponents of criticizing Mr. Obama, an argument he had made following the debate. At AFSCME, he said that the administration\u2019s controversial deportation practices focused on \u201cfelons.\u201d [We tracked down the 2020 Democrats and asked them the same set of questions. Watch them answer.] And he explained his own opposition to decriminalizing illegal border crossings, a view that contrasts with several of his more liberal opponents. \u201cIt will be an invitation to come,\u201d he said of decriminalization, going on to add that he and \u201cBarack\u201d sought to increase \u201cthe total amount of immigration\u201d and stressing his support for asylum seekers. \u201cObama remains almost universally popular with Democrats, so it makes sense for Biden to position attacks on his support for Obama\u2019s policies as attacks against Obama himself,\u201d said David Axelrod, Mr. Obama\u2019s former chief strategist, even as he noted that Mr. Biden\u2019s strong standing in the African-American community is linked to \u201cthe sense that he always had Barack\u2019s back.\u201d He added: \u201cThat said, you can overdo it and appear to be using Obama too much as a shield. And if you take this path, it\u2019s risky to cherry-pick and imply that you privately dissented on some of the more controversial policies while you embrace other, more popular policies as your own.\u201d Mr. Biden on Saturday morning addressed criticism that he had been selective about which elements of Mr. Obama\u2019s legacy he embraced, an argument Senator Cory Booker had made in their debate. \u201cI\u2019m not cherry-picking anything,\u201d he said. \u201cAs someone once said before, \u2018I\u2019ll take all the blame if I get half the credit.\u2019\u201d Mr. Booker, for his part, defended their debate clash, telling reporters that even as they had sharp differences, especially on criminal justice matters, \u201cthat was a very healthy exchange. It wasn\u2019t sucker punching. It wasn\u2019t demeaning in any way.\u201d They were two of many presidential contenders to lay out campaign promises on issues ranging from labor to health care to immigration as they sought to court union members, a crucial constituency in this state and in the Democratic Party. Ms. Warren, an advocate for \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d a sweeping single-payer health care proposal, stressed that she would include union leaders in planning a transition to that system, amid arguments from some that many workers like the health insurance plans that are tied to their employers or unions. \u201cThe first part of the transition, as I see it, is the unions are at the table,\u201d the senator from Massachusetts said. \u201cNobody does anything without working people well-represented. There are a lot of folks \u2014\u2014 you bet,\u201d she said, nodding to applause, \u201dwho are in a lot of different positions in terms of health care plans. And what matters most is we get everybody at the table to figure out how everybody gets fully compensated for what they\u2019ve negotiated for. This is a matter of both respect and a matter of economics.\u201d Asked if she would pledge to have a labor leader as her labor secretary, she exclaimed, \u201cThat\u2019s what I want!\u201d Senator Bernie Sanders did not commit to hiring a union leader as labor secretary, but said he would hire the best person for the job. The crowd did not seem pleased, and Mr. Sanders stood up abruptly. \u201cI think on my feet, not on my backside,\u201d he said to laughter. \u201cThere is no labor secretary stronger in trade and labor than who I will appoint.\u201d Ms. Harris, for her part, said she would \u201cput in place a labor secretary who understands the dignity of work.\u201d At his final stop of the day, Mr. Biden talked about another administration position, sharing his thoughts on a potential vice president, in response to a question about selecting a female running-mate if he is the Democratic nominee. He said he could think of \u201cfour women right off the bat\u201d whom he would consider asking to be vice president, \u201csome of whom are not running at all, are not engaged, they\u2019re not out there running, who in fact have the capacity to be president of the United States.\u201d In extensive remarks about what he would look for in a vice president \u2014 including shared philosophical outlook and trustworthiness \u2014 he later raised that number to a \u201chalf a dozen,\u201d but did not name names.",

      "author": "Katie Benner",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Not long after Barack Obama took office in 2009, a Homeland Security Department analyst produced a report presciently predicting that the deep economic downturn, the rise of social media and the election of the first black president would combine to make race-driven extremism a growing and serious threat to national security. But when the report was made public, it ignited a storm of protest, mostly from the right. Mike Pompeo, then a Republican congressman from Kansas and now secretary of state, said focusing on domestic terrorism was a \u201cdangerous\u201d undertaking born of political correctness that denied \u201cthe threat that radical Islamic terrorism poses.\u201d Inside the Obama administration there was concern that highlighting the issue would only fuel white supremacist conspiracy theories or give unwarranted publicity to fringe figures, according to six former administration officials. Within weeks, Janet Napolitano, then the homeland security secretary, rescinded the threat assessment. The report\u2019s primary author left the government, and the department\u2019s unit dedicated to tracking domestic terrorism was essentially disbanded. A decade later, there is clear evidence that violence by white extremists is an undeniable and intensifying problem, especially after the racially motivated mass shooting in El Paso. But the question of how the government should attack domestic extremism, especially white supremacists, remains as politically fraught as ever, if for far different reasons, under President Trump. Federal law enforcement has been tracking the rise of domestic terrorism. The F.B.I. director, Christopher A. Wray, told lawmakers last month that the bureau had arrested almost as many domestic terrorists as foreign terrorists this year. He said most of the racially motivated domestic terrorism cases were probably connected to white supremacy. But a look at the experience of the Homeland Security Department, which is responsible for collecting data on and analyzing threats to the United States, shows how political considerations have constrained efforts to give the problem more prominence and develop policies to counter it. During the Obama years, the pressure to minimize the problem came largely from outside the administration, primarily from Republicans who saw it as a diversion from fighting Islamic extremism but also to a lesser degree from people on the left concerned about the implications for the civil liberties of American citizens. Under Mr. Trump, the skepticism is rooted inside the White House. Officials at the department have felt they could not broach topics like domestic terrorism and white supremacist violence with Mr. Trump because he was not interested in those concerns, two people familiar with deliberations inside the administration said. At one point, Kirstjen Nielsen, then the homeland security secretary, sought a regular meeting with Mr. Trump to brief him on a variety of topics including domestic terrorism, but her proposal was rejected by the White House, a person with knowledge of the effort said. And Mr. Trump continues to harbor a deep distrust of the F.B.I., which has made public statements about the threat of domestic terrorists and racially motivated violence as growing national security threats. Since Mr. Trump took office, the Homeland Security Department has focused primarily on foreign terrorism and immigration, giving little attention to domestic extremism. In an interview on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday, Kevin K. McAleenan, the acting homeland security secretary, said domestic terrorism was becoming a national counterterrorism priority \u201cfor the first time,\u201d but confirmed that the department had devoted most resources to \u201cborder and international issues.\u201d One program left over from the Obama administration, a $10 million pot of money to pay for a community partnership program to prevent violent extremism, withered as participants withdrew after Mr. Trump issued a ban on travel from several predominantly Muslim countries. Intelligence analysts in the department\u2019s Office of Intelligence and Analysis who focused on domestic terrorism and collaborated with local law enforcement on domestic terrorism were dispersed to other counterterrorism programs. In the language he uses, the president has also at times played down the threat of white supremacy at home and around the world. Mr. Trump said this spring that he did not see a global increase in the threat of white supremacy. \u201cI think it\u2019s a small group of people that have very, very serious problems,\u201d he said. After the El Paso shooting he said the nation \u201cmust condemn racism, bigotry and white supremacy,\u201d but the next day accused a Democratic presidential contender, Beto O\u2019Rourke, of using a \u201cphony name\u201d to imply that he had Hispanic heritage. The United States has always been plagued by violence associated with white nationalism. Violence associated with white nationalism has spiked at intervals in recent decades, including the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995. But government data shows that, since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, far-right extremists carried out nearly three times as many attacks on Americans in the United States as Islamic extremists did. Incidents of white supremacist propaganda such as the posting of fliers increased 182 percent in 2018, from 421 in 2017 to 1,187 last year, and the number of racist rallies increased nearly 20 percent, according to the Anti-Defamation League. Hate crimes have increased over the past several years, and reached a nine-year high in 2017, the latest year available, according to F.B.I. data. \u201cIndividuals adhering to racially motivated violent extremism ideology have been responsible for the most lethal incidents among domestic terrorists in recent years,\u201d Michael C. McGarrity, an official in the F.B.I.\u2019s counterterrorism division, testified before Congress in June. The figures were already rising at the time Mr. Obama won the presidency. But the backlash against the 2009 report from the Homeland Security Department underscored how the nexus of race, national security and civil liberties would limit the effort to confront the problem. Former law enforcement officials say white supremacists were energized by the 2008 election. On social media they discussed the possibility of a race war should Mr. Obama become president. Hate crimes peaked that year in October, according to the National Archive of Criminal Justice Data, when his election seemed assured. And traffic to white nationalist websites like Stormfront increased after the election, said Derek Black, a former white supremacist whose father founded Stormfront. Mr. Black, who has left the movement, said that having a black president motivated new recruits to join. The Homeland Security Department report, issued amid this activity, predicted the growth of \u201cright-wing extremist activity, specifically the white supremacist and militia movements,\u201d and said the recession could help recruitment because people economically at risk were more susceptible to extremists of all stripes. Internet platforms, the report said, would let domestic extremists meet and radicalize others individuals \u2014 just as foreign extremists like the Islamic State would do. The multipronged Republican backlash included criticism of the term \u201cright-wing extremism,\u201d and a near disavowal of the existence of domestic terrorism. Republican politicians and pundits echoed Mr. Pompeo\u2019s assertion that the idea of domestic terrorism was a feint, born of political correctness, meant to distract from foreign terrorism. The report, said John D. Cohen, who acted as the Homeland Security Department\u2019s counterterrorism coordinator in the Obama administration and a senior adviser to the director of national intelligence in the George W. Bush administration, had a significant problem: It did not clearly distinguish between hateful speech, which is protected by the First Amendment, and violent behavior. Mr. Cohen said that problem made the job of defending the report much harder by raising substantial civil liberties concerns. \u201cThe C.I.A. and the intelligence community don\u2019t have to distinguish between extreme ideas and violence because they deal with foreign actors whose speech and affiliations are not protected by the First Amendment,\u201d Mr. Cohen said. Republicans pushed back against the idea that domestic terrorism was a serious national security threat for the duration of the Obama administration, even as local law enforcement officials said white supremacists and other right-wing groups were contributing to crime and endangering officers in the field. At the same time, Democrats were concerned that clamping down on domestic extremism could pose grave civil liberties risks. The Obama administration\u2019s plan to work with community groups to identify signs of radicalization was seen with some skepticism even inside some corners of the Justice Department at the time because it could smack of inappropriate surveillance, according to a former Justice Department official. The criticism from the right and qualms from the left meant there was no strong constituency pushing to address policy toward domestic terrorism more effectively, people involved in the issue during the Obama years said. \u201cThe public criticism did at times limit our ability to get the message out,\u201d said George Selim, the former director of the Office of Community Partnerships at the Homeland Security Department, which oversees the counterradicalization program. He left in 2017. Rather than pursuing a big public strategy, the Obama administration \u201cdid a lot of good and often quiet work in this arena,\u201d said Ned Price, a former C.I.A. official and member of Mr. Obama\u2019s National Security Council staff. By 2016, after much quiet lobbying, the Homeland Security Department obtained the $10 million in funding from Congress for the community partnership program, seeing it as a step toward preventing radicalization. Mr. Trump\u2019s 2016 election, and his early efforts to implement the travel ban and to build a wall along the southern border, upended the program. For those already wary of the government, \u201cit was a worst fear come true for organizations we spent literally years building trust with,\u201d Mr. Selim said. \u201cParticipants in the program withdrew.\u201d The White House rejected the previous administration\u2019s decision to counter violent extremism broadly, and instead focused primarily on foreign terrorism, limiting references to domestic extremism in its national counterterrorism strategy, people involved in the issue said. Republicans who are willing now to acknowledge a growing threat from domestic terrorism and white supremacy still face a difficult political challenge in navigating issues of race and identity, especially given their party\u2019s heavy reliance under Mr. Trump on white voters. And their efforts would run up against Mr. Trump\u2019s own focus on the threat from foreigners and immigrants. At a recent hearing, Representative Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat who is chairman of a House Oversight Committee subcommittee with jurisdiction over homeland security, told officials with the Homeland Security Department that \u201cwe could not find that it had any comprehensive strategy to address white supremacist violence.\u201d The department, Mr. Raskin said in an interview, responded that it \u201cwould work on it and brief us at the end of the summer.\u201d The department did not respond to requests for comment.",

It Wasn\u2019t Always That Simple.Their partnership is the stuff of buddy-movie lore, but those who saw it up close described a more difficult, complicated dynamic.By Glenn ThrushPRINT EDITIONBumpy Beginnings of the Obama-Biden Ticket|August 17, 2019, Page A1",
      "author": "Glenn Thrush",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Barack Obama was riding his call for generational change to the Democratic presidential nomination in the spring of 2008 when he began musing about potential running mates with aides traveling with him on the trail. \u201cI want somebody with gray in his hair,\u201d Mr. Obama, then 46, told one of them. He was thinking about an \u201colder guy,\u201d he told another. That older guy, people around the candidate would soon learn, was Joseph R. Biden Jr., 65, a has-been to pundits but to Mr. Obama a sweet-spot pick \u2014 a policy heavyweight with limited political horizons, assuming that would ensure loyalty and minimal drama. Mr. Obama was already phoning Mr. Biden two or three times a week to solicit advice, and to decide whether the Delaware senator\u2019s many positive attributes outweighed his singular liability, a notoriously self-tangling tongue. Over the next several months, Mr. Obama\u2019s top advisers would present 30 alternatives, all of whom he respectfully considered. But his preference was clear from the start. When it came time to decide in August, Mr. Obama chose Mr. Biden over two younger finalists \u2014 Tim Kaine, the governor of Virginia, and Senator Evan Bayh of Indiana, peers in the mold of Bill Clinton\u2019s choice of Al Gore in 1992. \u201cYou are the pick of my heart, but Joe is the pick of my head,\u201d Mr. Obama told Mr. Kaine after he made his choice, according to people with knowledge of the exchange. Eleven years later, Mr. Obama\u2019s cautions and calculations have come to roost. Mr. Obama, standard-bearer of change but conscious of the racial dynamics of his candidacy, was wary of asking voters to digest too much at once. In Mr. Biden, he found a running mate who would conjure the comforting past and provide experience he did not possess, but would not maneuver for the presidency from the No. 2 slot. While Mr. Biden exceeded the first two expectations, he never abandoned his aspirations for the top job. He has leveraged his steady vice presidency into a fragile front-runner status in the 2020 primary, at the even more advanced, and politically vulnerable, age of 76. What\u2019s more, the choice of Mr. Biden as a hedge against change has left the demographically and ideologically evolving Democrats profoundly divided as they desperately seek to unseat President Trump. Even as Mr. Biden casts himself as the man to complete and cement the Obama legacy, that legacy has moved to the center of the Democrats\u2019 fractious debate. While paying homage to Mr. Obama, who remains popular among Democratic voters, many candidates, including Senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, are urging the party to move far beyond his administration\u2019s positions on immigration, criminal justice, health care, the regulation of banks, the environment, income inequality and race, which they now view as timid, conservative or dated. \u201cYou invoke President Obama more than anybody in this campaign. You can\u2019t do it when it\u2019s convenient and then dodge it when it\u2019s not,\u201d Mr. Booker said to Mr. Biden during the most recent Democratic debate. The Obama-Biden origin story has been often told, and often sentimentalized. But a re-examination at this crystallizing moment of the primary campaign, based on more than two dozen interviews with Obama and Biden aides and others with knowledge of the relationship, reveals a more complicated dynamic between the two men, and one that is still evolving. Mr. Biden and his advisers initially thought he might be a better fit as Mr. Obama\u2019s secretary of state, and he bridled at the Obama campaign\u2019s attempt to control his every utterance and personnel move. He exploded when campaign researchers began asking questions about the private life of his family, especially his younger son, Hunter. Mr. Obama, for his part, took a long time to warm to Mr. Biden, and kept him at arms\u2019 length, and on a leash, in the early days. Up until earlier this year, he suggested Mr. Biden would be better off sticking with his vague promise, made during the audition for the vice presidency, that his short-lived 2008 presidential campaign would be his last. That has changed: While initially skeptical of Mr. Biden\u2019s decision to run, Mr. Obama, driven by affection and loyalty, has been more active in advising his campaign than previously known \u2014 going so far as to request a briefing from the campaign before his friend officially joined the fray, according to people close to both men. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredible turn of events, when you think about it,\u201d said Mr. Bayh, who retired from the Senate in 2011. \u201cThe question then was, \u2018Do you happen to fit the moment?\u2019 The question now is, \u2018After all these years, can you turn yourself into an independent source of power, as opposed to being just a loyal and faithful wingman?\u2019 Only time will tell.\u201d Mr. Biden ran for president in 2008 because he thought he could do a better job than anyone else, saw no real downside, and as chairman of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee wanted to advance a cherished policy idea: a plan for partitioning Iraq into three ethnic enclaves. \u201cHe felt a responsibility to do it,\u201d recalled Ted Kaufman, one of Mr. Biden\u2019s oldest friends and advisers. \u201cHe looked around at the potential people who would run, and he concluded, \u2018It\u2019s my time to run.\u2019 It wasn\u2019t a complex set of decisions. If he lost, he lost.\u201d Others in Mr. Biden\u2019s orbit discerned a deeper motive: Here was his final chance to exorcise the humiliating memories of a promising 1988 campaign demolished by reports he had plagiarized speeches. [Read more about how Joe Biden\u2019s \u201988 campaign fell apart.] Mr. Biden drove his 2008 campaign from the lot directly into a pothole. On the eve of its rollout, in January 2007, he told a reporter for The New York Observer that Mr. Obama was \u201cthe first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy.\u201d Mr. Biden did not bother to tell any of his aides that the interview had gone catastrophically wrong. Mr. Obama laughed it off. But it did little to improve his overall impression of Mr. Biden as condescending to him, forged when Mr. Obama was assigned to the Foreign Relations Committee shortly after being elected to the Senate in 2004. During their first private meeting, Mr. Biden suggested the two men have dinner, and offered to pick up the bill. The freshman senator, who was earning millions from his memoirs, shot back that he could afford to pay, according to Mr. Biden\u2019s retelling of the episode in his own autobiography. Their relationship had nowhere to go but up, and as the 2008 primary race rolled on, it did. Mr. Biden\u2019s witty self-confidence and command of policy at the debates elicited admiration from Mr. Obama, who struggled with the format despite his greater oratorical gifts. Over time, Mr. Obama dropped his guard a bit, and Mr. Biden treated him respectfully on the debate stage. A little too respectfully, in the eyes of one particular ally of Hillary Clinton, who was also seeking the nomination. At one of the final debates before the Iowa caucuses, Mr. Biden and Christopher Dodd, the Connecticut senator who shared a plane with his friend Mr. Biden to cut costs on their shoestring campaigns, were approached by Mr. Clinton. \u201cYou know, I really thought you guys would do a better job pointing out Obama\u2019s lack of experience,\u201d Mr. Dodd recalled Mr. Clinton saying. Mr. Biden managed just 4 percent of the vote in Iowa on the night of Jan. 3, 2008. His communications adviser, Larry Rasky, suggested he soldier on in New Hampshire, and the candidate wavered for a moment. But his sister, Valerie Owens Biden, shot it down, and he dropped out. Mr. Biden slipped back to the Senate, and seemed at peace. Shortly after dropping out, he approached Mr. Bayh, who had briefly considered running for president, in the Senate gym. \u201cYou were a whole hell of a lot smarter than I was!\u201d Mr. Biden said, according to Mr. Bayh. \u201cI never had a goddamn chance!\u201d Plus there was the pull of the Senate. One hallmark of the generational difference between Mr. Biden and Mr. Obama was in their view of the place. The younger man saw it as a steppingstone. Mr. Biden had spent 36 years of his life there, and shared a bygone belief that the ability to work a single, stable job was at the heart of the American dream. For all that, Mr. Biden had begun to hold what\u2019s-next strategy sessions at his home in Delaware, known as the \u201cThe Lake\u201d house with Mr. Kaufman, his adviser; his sister; his older son, Beau; and his two most trusted political advisers, Mike Donilon and John Marttila. In his increasingly frequent phone calls, Mr. Obama suggested that he was trying to figure out \u201ca way to get you into my administration one way or another,\u201d according to a former Biden aide. The Biden team discussed the possibility that he might be tapped to be secretary of state, said a person involved in some of the talks. It was around that time, in February or March, that Mr. Donilon raised the idea of the vice presidency. Mr. Biden, according to two people in his orbit, initially dismissed the idea, saying he had no interest in being anyone\u2019s \u201csecond banana.\u201d \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that easy for him to move on,\u201d said Terrell McSweeny, a longtime Biden policy adviser. Still, \u201che was starting to ask himself, \u2018What can I do that will make the biggest difference for my country?\u2019\u201d Mr. Biden did not dissuade his people from exploring the opportunity. By the summer, Mr. Obama\u2019s two top strategists, David Plouffe and David Axelrod, had Mr. Biden at the top of their list. The choice was not just about politics and optics. Mr. Obama, confident to the point of cockiness about his political chops, was privately expressing anxiety about his ability to govern \u2014 conceding that Mrs. Clinton, his chief rival for the nomination, had made valid points about his inexperience. \u201cHe needed somebody in the Situation Room, and somebody who would deal with Mitch so he wouldn\u2019t have to,\u201d said Mr. Axelrod, referring to Mitch McConnell, the combative Senate Republican leader. Mr. Biden\u2019s relationship with Mr. McConnell would come with its own complications. In late 2012, Mr. Obama tapped his vice president to negotiate one-on-one with Mr. McConnell what was known as the \u201cfiscal cliff,\u201d a budget-cutting deal. It produced one previously unreported incident that left White House and Senate staff scratching their heads: During a follow-up meeting in the Oval Office in early 2013, Mr. McConnell ruled out a big deal before the 2014 midterms, when he would be running for re-election in Kentucky. Mr. Biden responded by saying, \u201cMitch, we want to see you come back,\u201d an off-the-cuff endorsement of one of their biggest adversaries. \u201cThat was Joe Biden being Joe Biden,\u201d said Harry Reid, then the Senate Democratic leader, who was in the room, adding that it was an attempt to put Mr. McConnell at ease. One of the first decisions Mr. Obama\u2019s search team made was to exclude Mrs. Clinton from consideration, despite a tepid public claim that she was in the running. The protracted primary fight had simply been too bitter, and the president would soon offer her the State Department, to put her near, but not so very near, the seat of power. The extended list of hopefuls included Ohio\u2019s governor, Ted Strickland; a moderate Texas congressman, Chet Edwards; and Mark Warner, a former governor of Virginia who was running for Senate that year. Kathleen Sebelius, the progressive governor of Kansas, was added later to compensate for the gender imbalance. In the end, however, it came down to Mr. Biden and two men who would have represented generational change: Mr. Bayh, then 52, and Mr. Kaine, 50. It was indicative of Mr. Obama\u2019s unsentimental approach that his personal favorite, Mr. Kaine, finished third. The nominee viewed him as too young and too unschooled in foreign affairs to help him in the campaign or White House. Mr. Obama was also deeply worried about a backlash against a black man at the top of the ticket, and believed that an older white running mate would ease fears in battleground states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Indiana that he had lost in the primaries. \u201cBarack Hussein Obama is change enough for most people,\u201d Mr. Obama said of passing over Mr. Kaine, according to Mr. Axelrod. In late July, Mr. Plouffe and Mr. Axelrod embarked on a one-day trip from the campaign\u2019s Chicago headquarters to audition all three, starting with Mr. Biden in Delaware. \u201cBasically I said, \u2018Forgive me for being so blunt, but how do we know you know how to shut up?\u2019\u201d Mr. Axelrod recalled asking. \u201cAn hour later, he finished answering. So I asked him another question.\u201d [Joe Biden has a long history of verbal flubs and gaffes. And he knows it.] Mr. Biden was candid about his struggle to maintain verbal discipline, and he repeatedly interrupted himself to ask, \u201cAm I making sense?\u201d But the quantity of his advice was offset by its quality. Mr. Obama\u2019s political magi were especially impressed with his insights into the Republican nominee, Senator John McCain. The former Navy pilot valued unpredictability, Mr. Biden said, anticipating Mr. McCain\u2019s selection of Sarah Palin as his running mate and Mr. McCain\u2019s disastrous decision to suspend his campaign that fall to focus on the global financial crisis. What most impressed Mr. Obama\u2019s advisers, however, was Mr. Biden\u2019s ease with his family; he was comfortable expressing affection to his wife and grown children in a way that most politicians, including Mr. Obama, were not. The intensity of those bonds would become apparent after Mr. Obama picked Mr. Biden, and campaign researchers uncovered potential public relations problems stemming from Mr. Biden\u2019s son Hunter, including complications from his lobbying work and indications of marital, legal and substance-abuse problems. (Those issues were examined in detail by The New Yorker earlier this year.) When an Obama campaign official flagged the issue, Mr. Biden grew angry and warned, \u201cKeep my family out of this.\u201d The issue was dropped, according to a person involved in the vetting process. The talk later in the day with Mr. Bayh, who was vacationing at the tony Greenbrier resort in West Virginia with his wife and young children, did not go well. The visitors caught him barefoot, emerging from a shower \u2014 and assumed it was an attempt to appear Kennedyesque. In reality, Mr. Bayh was less diffident than disoriented by being thrust into the national spotlight. Mr. Bayh had another major liability. Mr. Reid, the Senate Democratic leader, had advised Mr. Obama that picking Mr. Bayh would guarantee his Senate seat would flip Republican \u2014 which could imperil the new president\u2019s legislative agenda. Mr. Biden\u2019s seat in Democratic Delaware was much safer. The meeting with Mr. Kaine in Richmond was respectful, friendly and a bit bittersweet. (Eight years later, Mr. Kaine would be Mrs. Clinton\u2019s running mate in the losing campaign against Mr. Trump.) In early August, Mr. Obama arranged to have Mr. Biden quietly shuttled to his suite at the Graves 601 Hotel in Minneapolis, where he was campaigning. The conversation lasted well into the night. Mr. Obama agreed that Mr. Biden would be the final person he spoke to before making a big decision, and the two men would have weekly lunches. Mr. Biden also made a loyalty pledge that would become the basis of their deeper personal bond. \u201cYou make a decision, and I will follow it to my death,\u201d Mr. Biden said, according to Mr. Kaufman. At some point, Mr. Biden also told Obama aides that \u201cBarack would never have to worry\u201d about him positioning himself for another presidential run. He was too old, he told them, and he viewed his new job as a capstone, not a catapult. But while both sides assumed that vow covered the duration of Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency, what might happen after that was never explicitly stated. Mr. Biden was the only one of the finalists to make such a promise. \u201cThat was helpful,\u201d Mr. Plouffe said. Before parting, Mr. Obama popped a surprise, intended to test Mr. Biden\u2019s commitment to being a wingman: \u201cWould you prefer being secretary of state to vice president?\u201d he asked. Mr. Biden chose the latter. Mr. Obama formally offered him the job after he flew back to Washington. Neither man has ever spoken publicly about exactly what was said, but one Biden aide who was watching the little red switchboard light for the senator\u2019s private line said it stayed on too long for it to have simply been a perfunctory call of congratulations. The next eight years are the stuff of buddy-movie lore \u2014 \u201ca shotgun marriage that gradually turned into a love story,\u201d in Mr. Axelrod\u2019s telling. Still, Mr. Biden\u2019s simmering ambition was a source of unease for both men. Mr. Plouffe shut down an early move made by Mr. Biden as vice president to assemble a presidential team-in-waiting, blocking Mr. Biden\u2019s attempts to court the party\u2019s West Coast fund-raising elite and rejecting an attempt to hire Kevin Sheekey, a veteran Democratic operative. In 2016, Mr. Obama quietly pressured Mr. Biden to sit out the race, partly because he believed Mrs. Clinton had a better chance of building on his agenda, and partly because he thought Mr. Biden was in no shape emotionally following the illness and death of his son Beau in May 2015. By now, the line between heart and head, between the personal and political, so clear a decade ago, has blurred completely. The two men spoke at least a half dozen times before Mr. Biden decided to run, and Mr. Obama took pains to cast his doubts about the campaign in personal terms. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this, Joe, you really don\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Obama told Mr. Biden earlier this year, according to a person familiar with the exchange. Mr. Biden \u2014 who thinks he could have defeated Donald Trump four years ago \u2014 responded by telling Mr. Obama he could never forgive himself if he turned down a second shot at Mr. Trump. Mr. Obama has said he will not make an endorsement in the primary, and has offered every candidate his counsel. But he has taken an active interest in the inner workings of his friend\u2019s campaign, to an extent beyond anything offered to other candidates. In his interactions with Mr. Biden \u2014 the pair had a quiet lunch in Washington last month \u2014 Mr. Obama has hammered away at the need for his campaign to expand his aging inner circle. He has communicated his frustration that Mr. Biden\u2019s closest advisers are too old and out of touch with the current political climate \u2014 urging him to include more younger aides, according to three Democrats with direct knowledge of the discussion. In March, Mr. Obama took the unusual step of summoning Mr. Biden\u2019s top campaign advisers, including the former White House communications director Anita Dunn and Mr. Biden\u2019s longtime spokeswoman, Kate Bedingfield, to his Washington office for a briefing on the campaign\u2019s digital and communications strategy with members of his own staff, including his senior adviser, Eric Schultz. When they were done, Mr. Obama offered a pointed reminder, according to two people with knowledge of his comments: Win or lose, they needed to make sure Mr. Biden did not \u201cembarrass himself\u201d or \u201cdamage his legacy\u201d during the campaign.",

ShearPRINT EDITIONJustice Dept. Argues Case On DACA At Top Court|August 20, 2019, Page A13",
      "author": "Michael D. Shear",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Justice Department lawyers told the Supreme Court on Monday that President Trump acted lawfully in September 2017 when he decided to end an Obama-era program that protects young undocumented immigrants from deportation. In a legal brief submitted to the court, the lawyers asserted that the president was fully within his rights to eliminate the program, known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, and said the lower courts were mistaken when they said Mr. Trump\u2019s action almost two years ago was arbitrary. The Department of Homeland Security \u201ccorrectly, and at a minimum reasonably, concluded that DACA is unlawful,\u201d the lawyers argued, disputing the conclusions by the lower court judges about the three reasons the administration gave for ending the program. \u201cNone of those three grounds is remotely arbitrary or capricious, let alone all three.\u201d The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments about the fate of the program in November. The justices could decide the case next spring or summer, just as the presidential election campaign is in full swing. The government\u2019s brief, filed late Monday, is the first salvo in what could be one of the biggest legal tests of the president\u2019s immigration agenda. The outcome of the case will probably determine whether Mr. Trump can make good on a central campaign promise. The court\u2019s ruling, when it comes, could also energize partisans on both sides of the fierce debate over immigration. A decision to allow Mr. Trump to deport more than one million young people could galvanize immigrants to work against the president\u2019s re-election. But immigration is a central issue for Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters, as well. A decision against the president could become a rallying cry on the right to argue that the Trump administration needs another four years to carry out its policies. The future of DACA has been fiercely debated in Washington for years. Under the program, undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as young children, often referred to as Dreamers, are temporarily shielded from deportation and allowed to live and work legally in the country. President Barack Obama created DACA in 2012 through executive action after Congress refused to pass legislation to grant the young immigrants permanent legal status. As a presidential candidate, Mr. Trump argued that Mr. Obama\u2019s actions were an abuse of power and repeatedly called for the program to end. In September 2017, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that Mr. Trump was terminating the program because the Supreme Court had found a related program for the parents of Dreamers to be unconstitutional. \u201cSimply put, if we are to further our goal of strengthening the constitutional order and the rule of law in America, the Department of Justice cannot defend this type of overreach,\u201d Mr. Sessions said in a speech that month. A federal judge blocked the administration from ending the DACA program and an appeals court upheld that action, ruling that the rationale officially given by the Department of Homeland Security for abandoning the program did not withstand scrutiny. In the legal brief filed by the government on Monday, the Trump administration took issue with that assessment. They noted that Kirstjen Nielsen, who was secretary of homeland security until April, provided the courts three separate reasons for why the department was no longer going to provide protection to the Dreamers. The lawyers argued that the department properly was concerned that the program, which was similar to the one for the parents, would be found unconstitutional. They also noted that \u201cas a matter of policy, D.H.S. wanted to terminate a legally questionable nonenforcement policy and leave the creation of policies as significant as DACA to Congress.\u201d That, they said in the brief, should be reason enough for the termination of the program to stand. The government\u2019s lawyers also rejected an argument made by the other side that Ms. Nielsen and Elaine Duke, the acting homeland security secretary who preceded Ms. Nielsen and officially terminated the program, were motivated by prejudice. They said the \u201callegations are wholly insufficient to show that Secretaries Duke and Nielsen were motivated by racial animus in deciding to rescind a policy sanctioning the ongoing violation of federal immigration law by 700,000 aliens, especially given the serious questions about its legality.\u201d Lawyers for the groups seeking to keep DACA alive will file their briefs in the coming weeks.",

      "author": "Michael Crowley",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump said on Tuesday that Russia should be readmitted to the Group of 7 industrialized nations, a call for ending Moscow\u2019s pariah status on the world stage that is likely to earn a cool reception when the group\u2019s annual summit opens this weekend. Speaking a few days before his planned departure for the summit, in Biarritz, France, Mr. Trump said that Moscow\u2019s exclusion since 2014 from the group of leading economic powers should be reversed and, ignoring Russia\u2019s aggression in Ukraine, contended that the true reason for it was President Barack Obama\u2019s wounded pride. \u201cI think it\u2019s much more appropriate to have Russia in,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office before a meeting with President Klaus Iohannis of Romania. \u201cI could certainly see it being the G8 again.\u201d One reason, Mr. Trump said, was \u201cbecause a lot of the things we talk about have to do with Russia.\u201d Russia was disinvited from gatherings of the former Group of 8 after the country\u2019s annexation of Crimea, which in a joint statement the remaining group members called a violation of international law that could have \u201cgrave implications for the legal order that protects the unity and sovereignty of all states.\u201d Mr. Trump, who made similar comments before last year\u2019s Group of 7 meeting in Canada, did not attach any conditions to his proposal, which could signal that the international community has moved on from Russia\u2019s aggression toward Ukraine. It was the latest of several suggestions by Mr. Trump \u2014 whose 2016 campaign\u2019s contacts with Kremlin-affiliated Russians were the subject of a long federal investigation, and who has personally courted the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin \u2014 that Russia has been unfairly treated by the United States and its allies. That was in contrast to the view of France\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron, who a day earlier told a visiting Mr. Putin that Russia could rejoin the elite gathering if it helped end the continuing conflict in Ukraine. Moscow has supported a bloody rebellion by pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine that the United Nations estimates has claimed more than 13,000 lives since it began five years ago. In a news conference with Mr. Putin, Mr. Macron called resolving the international \u201cdispute\u201d over Russia\u2019s policy toward Ukraine \u201cthe key\u201d to Russian readmission into a reconstituted Group of 8. Steven Pifer, a former United States ambassador to Ukraine, said he could envision a Russian return to the annual meetings, which aim for consensus action on issues like trade, terrorism, energy and the environment. But that should happen only if Russia earns its readmission by helping bring peace to Ukraine, he said. \u201cOn one level, I agree with President Trump that it would be nice to get to a new U.S.-Russia relationship,\u201d said Mr. Pifer, now a William Perry fellow at Stanford University. \u201cBut he never seems to suggest that Russia has to make some changes to its policies to get to that point.\u201d Mr. Pifer allowed that demanding the return of Crimea to Ukraine seemed much less realistic than an end to the conflict in eastern Ukraine. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see how Ukraine gets the leverage to get Crimea back,\u201d he said. In his remarks on Tuesday, Mr. Trump made no reference to Russia\u2019s annexation of the strategically valuable Crimean Peninsula, which began with a military intervention after Ukraine\u2019s 2014 revolution ousted a pro-Russia leader and was consummated in a referendum widely condemned as illegitimate. Instead, Mr. Trump, who has shown little concern about the fate of Crimea and has even suggested that it may rightfully belong to Russia, implied that Moscow\u2019s real offense had been to embarrass his predecessor, Mr. Obama, who had unsuccessfully warned Russia against seizing the region. \u201cI guess President Obama, because Putin outsmarted him, President Obama thought it wasn\u2019t a good thing to have Russia in,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cSo he wanted Russia out.\u201d \u201cWell, that\u2019s not the way it really should work,\u201d he added. The president addressed the issue on Tuesday in response to a question from a reporter, who noted that the United States will host next year\u2019s Group of 7 summit. Mr. Trump hinted that he would not press the issue himself, however. \u201cIf somebody would make that motion,\u201d the president said, \u201cI would certainly be disposed to think about it very favorably.\u201d Those remarks echoed Mr. Trump\u2019s words from June of last year when, before departing for the Group of 7 summit in Canada, he declared that \u201cRussia should be in this meeting.\u201d \u201cWhether you like it or not \u2014 and it may not be politically correct \u2014 but we have a world to run,\u201d he added. But that scenario appears highly unlikely for now. No other Group of 7 leaders echoed Mr. Trump\u2019s call last year. Nor does Russia seem to be clamoring for readmission. Appearing Monday with Mr. Macron, Mr. Putin did not reject the idea but asked: \u201cHow can I come back into an organization that doesn\u2019t exist? It is called the G7 today.\u201d Responding to a New York Times article that he is likely to tap his deputy secretary of state, John Sullivan, as his next ambassador to Moscow, Mr. Trump said that Mr. Sullivan was \u201cvery respected\u201d and \u201ccould very well\u201d be his nominee.",

      "content": " Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration policies were in the news again on Wednesday with the administration\u2019s release of a regulation that would allow it to detain indefinitely migrant families who cross the border illegally. Questioned about the new policy, which is sure to be challenged in court, Mr. Trump continued his pattern of blaming \u201cloopholes,\u201d nonexistent laws and former presidents for his own administration\u2019s practice of separating migrant families who cross illegally. President Barack Obama, in particular, has been wrongly cast as the instigator of the practice by Mr. Trump at least two dozen other times. Under Mr. Trump, the Justice Department announced its \u201czero-tolerance policy\u201d for illegally entering the United States in April 2018, describing it as \u201cnew\u201d and in response to an increase in unauthorized border crossings that spring. The policy called for the criminal prosecution of everyone who enters the country illegally. As a result, nearly 3,000 children were forcibly separated from adult family members who were detained under the new policy, which multiple top Trump officials have characterized as a deterrent. Mr. Trump signed an executive order in June 2018 that was meant to end the practice of family separation. While previous administrations did break up families, it was rare \u2014 for example, in cases in which there was doubt about the familial relationship between a child and an accompanying adult, according to former officials and immigration experts. \u201cNothing like what the Trump administration is doing has occurred before,\u201d Sarah Pierce of the Migration Policy Institute told The New York Times last year. Mr. Trump\u2019s aides and political allies have misleadingly claimed a 1997 consent decree known as the Flores settlement necessitated family separation. That court agreement limited how long the government could hold migrant children and set standards for their care. After a surge of families from Central America began arriving at the United States\u2019 southwestern border in 2014, the Obama administration opened family detention centers. That prompted criticism and more lawsuits, which argued that the move had breached the Flores settlement by not releasing children swiftly. In 2016, the Ninth Circuit of Appeals ruled that the Flores settlement \u201cunambiguously applies both to minors who are accompanied and unaccompanied by their parents.\u201d It also overturned a Federal District Court\u2019s decision that the government must also release the parents. The new rule unveiled by the Trump administration on Wednesday, if carried out, would replace the standards set by Flores and allow for the indefinite detention of families.",

      "content": "  HANOVER, N.H. \u2014 Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Friday took a series of unusual rhetorical detours at the end of a town-hall-style campaign event nominally dedicated to health care, speculating about how a political assassination of Barack Obama might have affected the country in 2008 and recalling that he was accused of being gay because of his support of women\u2019s rights in the 1970s. After speaking about the health care plan he introduced last month and taking a few questions, Mr. Biden grew most animated as he recalled the fraught political era of 1968, when he was in his final year of law school, and two of his political heroes, Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy, were assassinated within weeks of each other. \u201cMy senior semester they were both shot and killed,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cImagine what would have happened if, God forbid, Barack Obama had been assassinated after becoming the de facto nominee. What would have happened in America?\u201d \u201cThings changed,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou had over 40 kids shot at Kent State on a beautiful lawn by the National Guard.\u201d The shooting in question, in May 1970 during a Vietnam War protest, in fact ended with four students shot dead and nine wounded. Mr. Biden, 76, was making the point that events of the late 1960s and early \u201970s raised his political awareness and propelled him into a political career. He ran successfully for the United States Senate in 1972 at age 29. A campaign spokesman said Mr. Biden had previously drawn an analogy between an Obama assassination and the political killings of 1968 when speaking to younger audiences not alive at the time. In 2008, running for the Democratic presidential nomination, Hillary Clinton drew criticism when she referenced the political assassinations of 1968 as she defended staying in the long primary battle against Mr. Obama. She noted first that Bill Clinton had not wrapped up the nomination until June 1992, and then added, \u201cWe all remember Bobby Kennedy was assassinated in June in California.\u201d At the event on Friday, Mr. Biden also recalled his early support for women\u2019s rights, including the Equal Rights Amendment, and how he was he was sneered at for being on the edge of social change. He said critics had said, \u201cWell, you know why Biden is for the E.R.A., he\u2019s probably gay.\u201d Mr. Biden, the front-runner in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, compared his political awakening in his 20s to the present moment, asking how many members of the audience, on the campus of Dartmouth College, were high school or college students. About 40 hands went up in the audience of several hundred. \u201cUnless I\u2019m mistaken, Donald Trump did for your generation what the loss of two of my heroes did for mine,\u201d he told the students, adding, \u201cWhat they did was make you realize, my God, we\u2019re in trouble.\u201d Mr. Biden\u2019s walk-off line was a mic drop. Wondering if anyone two years ago would have believed a movie about the Trump administration so far, he invoked Mr. Trump calling himself \u201cthe chosen one\u201d while speaking to reporters outside the White House this week. \u201cI am the savior,\u201d Mr. Biden intoned, paraphrasing the president. \u201cI mean, come on, man,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cI mean. Anyway. Good night, folks.\u201d",

      "author": "Katie Glueck",
      "content": " Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s presidential campaign on Tuesday made an extraordinarily emotional appeal for his candidacy and his health care proposal through a new ad that highlights his struggles with grief and family loss, a message that reminds voters of the good will and empathy many have for the former vice president while accentuating one of his central policy goals. In the 60-second television spot, called \u201cPersonal,\u201d Mr. Biden tells the stories of his family tragedies that he often shares on the campaign trail as he discusses the importance of health care access. But the ad is striking for the wrenching images of Mr. Biden with his two sons who survived a car crash that killed his first wife and a daughter in 1972. One of those children, Beau Biden, would die of cancer in 2015, a development that drew widespread sympathy in Washington and around the country toward the end of Mr. Biden\u2019s second term in the Obama administration. While many Democratic voters have pointed to the political calculus about electability in explaining their early support for Mr. Biden, others have cited what they see as his ability to connect with people after facing so much personal adversity of his own. The spot is running in Iowa, part of a six-figure media campaign announced last week. The campaign\u2019s decision to launch the initial television advertising effort in the state that kicks off the presidential nominating process comes as Mr. Biden has dealt with a series of gaffes and controversies this summer, while also confronting stiffer challenges from rivals like Senator Elizabeth Warren. Ms. Warren\u2019s gains in Iowa have not gone unnoticed by the Biden campaign, according to some of his allies, who see her as his biggest challenge in the state. Aides are quick to note, however, that he has landed endorsements from several prominent Iowans who in 2016 supported Senator Bernie Sanders, who like Ms. Warren is a prominent progressive vying for the 2020 nomination. The new ad begins with Mr. Biden referring to  the 1972 car crash. Images of his two young sons recovering in the hospital, where he was sworn in as a senator from Delaware, are displayed on the screen. \u201cI couldn\u2019t imagine what it would have been like if we didn\u2019t have the health care they needed immediately,\u201d Mr. Biden says in the spot. The ad also references Beau Biden\u2019s battle with brain cancer and flashes an image of  Mr. Biden appearing to struggle emotionally. Mr. Biden frequently discusses his family tragedies on the trail now, and did so during his run for president in the 2008 campaign. But he has not always been comfortable doing so, friends say. As recently as 2015, a Los Angeles Times report indicated that Mr. Biden considered a commercial that discussed the car accident to be treading on \u201csacred ground.\u201d The group behind that spot, which was encouraging Mr. Biden to run for president, went on to say it would not televise that ad, and Mr. Biden did not seek the presidency the following year. \u201cFor decades Joe did not talk on the campaign trail or in public events about the ways in which life really, you know, brought him to his knees, the loss of Neilia and his daughter and the ways in which those first couple of years were incredibly hard for him,\u201d Senator Chris Coons of Delaware said in an interview in May, referring to Mr. Biden\u2019s first wife. \u201cIn recent years he\u2019s opened up a great deal more about it. And the equally tragic loss of his son Beau is something he\u2019s turned into an opportunity to connect with the whole country.\u201d The new spot is not just about family tragedy; it is described by the campaign as a health care ad, touching on an issue that was critical to the Democrats\u2019 victories in the 2018 midterm elections. The commercial obliquely makes an argument Mr. Biden often advances more directly on the campaign trail: that his Democratic opponents who support \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d a single-payer health care system, are by default supporting the replacement of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Mr. Biden\u2019s opponents say their goal is to further expand robust health care coverage. As he often does, Mr. Biden highlights his relationship with former President Barack Obama to argue for expanding on the current health care law rather than pursuing a more sweeping measure. Emphasizing his partnership with Mr. Obama, a respected figure in the Democratic Party, has been a central strategy in Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign. \u201cHealth care is personal to me,\u201d Mr. Biden says. \u201cObamacare is personal to me. When I see the president try to tear it down and others propose to replace it and start over, that\u2019s personal to me too. We\u2019ve got to build on what we did because every American deserves affordable health care.\u201d Last week, Mr. Biden released the first television ad of his campaign, called \u201cBones.\u201d It highlighted his standing against President Trump in early polls and sought to paint Mr. Biden as best positioned to beat him in a high-stakes moment for the country, even as he has seen his lead over his rivals slip in some polls.",

      "author": "Charlie Savage",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Democratic presidential candidates broadly agree that President Trump has shaken the presidency loose from its constitutional limits and say that the White House needs major new legal curbs, foreshadowing a potential era of reform akin to the post-Watergate period if any of them wins next year\u2019s election. In responses to a New York Times survey about executive power, the Democrats \u2014 along with two Republicans mounting primary challenges to Mr. Trump \u2014 envisioned a rebuke of his term by enshrining into law previous norms of presidential self-restraint. Many called for new laws that would require presidents to disclose their tax returns and to divest from significant assets; bar them from appointing close relatives to White House positions; and constrain their abilities to award security clearances and to fire special prosecutors investigating their administration, among other potential reforms. The survey is the first and most detailed collection of the candidates\u2019 views on a set of issues that they are rarely asked about, yet often prove crucial to the outcome of political fights: the scope and limits of a president\u2019s power to act unilaterally or even in defiance of statutes. The survey \u2014 which elicited answers from 15 Democrats, including all in the top polling tier and eight of the 10 in Thursday\u2019s debate \u2014 also focused on recurring constitutional disputes that have arisen under recent presidents of both parties on matters including secrecy and war. \u201cThe American people should fully know how candidates will use the power of the presidency,\u201d Senator Elizabeth Warren wrote, echoing other candidates who agreed that voters should know their views before deciding whom to entrust with the power of the White House. Presidents have \u201ca responsibility to make sure excess power is not used to start endless wars, attack the privacy of Americans, or undermine the democratic values of our country,\u201d she added. But though the candidates \u201cseem committed to reforming the presidency,\u201d they might have second thoughts from the vantage point of the Oval Office, said Jack Goldsmith, a Harvard law professor and former senior Justice Department official in the George W. Bush administration who reviewed their responses. \u201cThe next Democratic president will happily accept new rules on tax releases, but will have a harder time accepting constraints on security clearances and emergency or war powers,\u201d he said. \u201cInstitutional prerogative often defeats prior reformist pledges.\u201d Indeed, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. expressed a more expansive view of presidential war powers after eight years in the Obama White House than he did in 2007 during an earlier run for president. The 2020 candidates agreed on some issues, including that Mr. Bush was wrong to claim after the Sept. 11 attacks that he could override surveillance and anti-torture laws because he was the commander in chief. But they diverged about others, like whether President Barack Obama\u2019s invocation of the same power was legitimate. Mr. Obama used similar reasoning to disregard a requirement that he give Congress 30 days\u2019 notice before transferring Guant\u00e1namo Bay detainees as part of the 2014 Bowe Bergdahl prisoner swap. Senator Kamala Harris, for example, wrote that while a president can lawfully override or bypass statutes that are clearly unconstitutional, she thought the detainee transfer law \u2014 along with the surveillance and anti-torture laws \u2014 was a constitutional limit that presidents must obey. \u201cThe executive branch is not above the law,\u201d she wrote, adding, \u201cAs president, I would respect these laws.\u201d By contrast, Mr. Biden defended the decision by Mr. Obama \u2014 then his boss \u2014 to immediately carry out the exchange after the deal was struck instead of waiting 30 days. Obama administration officials argued that a delay would have endangered the captive soldier\u2019s life. \u201cThe transfer of detainees from Guant\u00e1namo was an exchange of prisoners in a conflict, and therefore a valid exercise of the commander-in-chief power,\u201d Mr. Biden wrote. He participated in an earlier iteration of the survey as a senator seeking the 2008 presidential nomination, and his new answers reflected the understanding of executive authority that he gained from watching close up as Mr. Obama wielded it. In late 2007, for example, Mr. Biden offered a restrictive view of when presidents may unilaterally direct the military to attack other countries, writing: \u201cThe Constitution is clear: Except in response to an attack or the imminent threat of attack, only Congress may authorize war and the use of force.\u201d But in the new survey, Mr. Biden called it \u201cwell established\u201d that presidents may launch limited strikes \u201cwithout prior congressional approval when those operations serve important U.S. interests.\u201d That legal rationale for ordering limited attacks without congressional approval echoed the Obama administration\u2019s stance during the NATO intervention in Libya in 2011. But the bombing campaign violated a limit on executive war-making powers that both Mr. Obama and Mr. Biden had said they would respect in the 2007 candidate survey. Importantly, however, Mr. Biden said both then and now that any bombing of Iranian nuclear sites \u2014 a prospect in which the scope of unilateral presidential war-making authority has repeatedly come up \u2014 would require prior authorization from Congress because it would carry too much risk of escalation into a major war. Still, several of Mr. Biden\u2019s rivals took a more constrained view, suggesting that a rationale of serving American \u201cinterests\u201d is not enough to justify even limited strikes without Congress. \u201cIn situations where the use of force is necessary, absent an imminent threat to our national security, I will take that case to Congress and the American people to seek authorization,\u201d former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke wrote. Most candidates left the door open to using presidential signing statements, when approving bills, to claim a right to bypass provisions they see as unconstitutionally infringing on executive powers. But the answers submitted by the campaign of Senator Bernie Sanders \u2014 which were written in third person \u2014 pledged he would never use them. \u201cSigning statements circumvent the will of Congress and have no constitutional or legal legitimacy,\u201d the response said. \u201cAs president, Bernie would not issue signing statements.\u201d The survey revealed broader disagreements about the wisdom of several other potential reforms raised by Mr. Trump\u2019s record. Significant numbers of candidates stood on both sides of ideas like curtailing future presidents\u2019 latitude to invoke emergency powers and to choose acting agency heads when temporarily filling vacancies. But the candidates were largely united in rejecting the view of Mr. Trump\u2019s legal team, including Attorney General William P. Barr, that obstruction of justice laws do not apply to presidents who abuse their official powers to interfere with investigations for corrupt reasons. Many also expressed skepticism of the Justice Department\u2019s view that sitting presidents are immune from indictment, which bound the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, as he weighed Mr. Trump\u2019s attempts to obstruct the Russia investigation. Most said they would sign a law pausing the statute of limitations for offenses by presidents, ensuring that they can still be prosecuted after leaving office. But they split over what else to do about it. Several said they would direct the department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel to rescind its opinion, while others sidestepped that question. Mayor Pete Buttigieg argued that it would interfere with Justice Department independence for a president to simply direct the office, commonly called O.L.C., to change its legal interpretation. \u201cBecause the integrity of the Justice Department is critical to the rule of law, I do not think it would be appropriate for any president to dictate the legal conclusions that O.L.C. may issue or retract,\u201d Mr. Buttigieg wrote. After The Times began the survey, Protect Democracy, a nonpartisan group of former officials seeking to prevent a decline \u201cinto a more authoritarian form of government,\u201d lobbied the candidates to participate. Justin Florence, a former Obama White House lawyer and the group\u2019s co-founder, praised those who answered the questions. \u201cWith democracy in retreat and autocratic politics on the rise here and around the world, this survey provides critical insights into how each candidate understands the limits on the immense powers they\u2019re seeking,\u201d Mr. Florence said. Several prominent Democratic candidates have not answered the questions. They include Mayor Bill de Blasio, who issued a general statement; Julian Castro, the former Housing and Urban Development secretary; former Representative John Delaney; and the businessmen Tom Steyer and Andrew Yang.",

      "content": "  HOUSTON \u2014 Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. clung tightly to the legacy of the Obama administration in a Democratic primary debate on Thursday, asking voters to view him as a stand-in for the former president as an array of progressive challengers, led by Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, brandished more daring policy promises and questioned Mr. Biden\u2019s political strength. Facing all of his closest competitors for the first time in a debate, Mr. Biden, the Democratic front-runner, repeatedly mentioned President Barack Obama\u2019s name and policy record as a shield against rivals who suggested his own record was flawed, or implied his agenda lacked ambition. On health care, immigration, foreign wars and more, Mr. Biden\u2019s central theme was his tenure serving under Mr. Obama. By  invoking Mr. Obama, a popular figure among Democrats, Mr. Biden sought to mute the ideological and generational divisions that have left him vulnerable in the primary race. To voters who might see him as a candidate of the past, Mr. Biden seemed to counter that the past was not so bad. In an early exchange over health care, Mr. Biden referred to Ms. Warren\u2019s support for Mr. Sanders\u2019s \u201cMedicare for all\u201d plan. \u201cThe senator says she\u2019s for Bernie,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cWell, I\u2019m for Barack \u2014 I think the Obamacare worked.\u201d [Here are six takeaways from the September Democratic debate.] Explaining his preference for more incremental health care improvements, like the creation of an optional government-backed plan, Mr. Biden challenged Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders to defend the cost of their plans, warning that they would require tax increases on middle-income Americans. Mr. Biden was steadier in what was his third debate of the primary contest, rattling off statistics and parrying attacks with good cheer, though he still rambled at other moments. And despite their criticism, none of the nine other candidates onstage appeared to significantly damage his candidacy. But Mr. Biden\u2019s challengers were undeterred by his embrace of Mr. Obama, and the progressive candidates made clear the choice before primary voters. Several of them argued  \u2014 some subtly, some stridently \u2014 that the party needed to move well beyond the policies of the last Democratic president. And if Mr. Biden appealed to voters\u2019 sense of nostalgia, his rivals pressed the case for broader change. Ms. Warren, of Massachusetts, argued that her and Mr. Sanders\u2019s approach would build upon Mr. Obama\u2019s legacy rather than unraveling it. She credited Mr. Obama with having \u201cfundamentally transformed health care,\u201d but said the next president had to go further. \u201cThe question is, how best can we improve on it?\u201d Ms. Warren said, promising: \u201cCosts are going to go up for giant corporations, but for hard-working families across this country, costs are going to go down.\u201d Mr. Sanders sidestepped the mention of Mr. Obama altogether, asserting to Mr. Biden that a single-payer system would save consumers money by breaking the influence of insurers seeking to \u201cprotect their profits.\u201d \u201cAmericans don\u2019t want to pay twice as much as other countries,\u201d Mr. Sanders, of Vermont, said. Other challengers in the 10-candidate field were less diplomatic in demanding a break from the center-left policy framework that guided the Obama administration. Juli\u00e1n Castro, who served as Mr. Obama\u2019s housing secretary, echoed the news anchor Jorge Ramos in questioning the Obama administration\u2019s record of deporting millions of illegal immigrants. When Mr. Ramos pressed Mr. Biden to say whether he had made any mistakes on immigration as vice president, Mr. Biden pleaded personal loyalty. \u201cWe didn\u2019t lock people up in cages, we didn\u2019t separate families,\u201d Mr. Biden said, adding, \u201cThe president did the best thing that was able to be done.\u201d But pressed by Mr. Ramos about his own role, Mr. Biden deflected: \u201cI\u2019m the vice president of the United States,\u201d he said. That prompted an impatient reaction from Mr. Castro, who repeated a criticism previously leveled at Mr. Biden by Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey. \u201cEvery time something good about Barack Obama comes up, he says, \u2018Oh, I was there, I was there, I was there, that\u2019s me, too,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Castro, who was the most aggressive combatant against Mr. Biden on Thursday.  \u201cAnd then every time somebody questions part of the administration that we were both part of, he says, \u2018Well, that was the president.\u2019\u201d Mr. Biden, he said, \u201cwants to take credit for Obama\u2019s work, but not have to answer to any questions.\u201d Mr. Biden responded as if Mr. Castro was asserting that Mr. Biden was insufficiently defensive of the former president. \u201cI stand with Barack Obama all eight years,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cGood, bad and indifferent.\u201d Mr. Biden\u2019s fealty to Mr. Obama, throughout the debate, was consistent with his overall approach to the campaign. He has staked out a position, unapologetically, as a candidate of the Democratic center, building a sizable but far from dominant base of support, anchored in the admiration of moderates, older voters and African-Americans. But he has yet to expand his appeal beyond that base, which appears to make up between a quarter and a third of the Democratic electorate. His resilience, though, has prompted some of his rivals to recalibrate their approach as the race enters the fall. After unleashing one of the contest\u2019s toughest attacks against Mr. Biden in the first debate, Senator Kamala Harris of California steadfastly avoided critiquing the former vice president or any of her Democratic opponents. Ms. Harris used her opening statement to speak directly to, and criticize, President Trump. During the health care contretemps she lamented that \u201cnot once have we talked about Donald Trump.\u201d And when she made the case for using executive action to overcome legislative gridlock, she turned to Mr. Biden, let out a laugh and borrowed Mr. Obama\u2019s signature line. \u201cHey, Joe, let\u2019s say, \u2018Yes we can,\u2019\u201d she said. Ms. Harris\u2019s attempt at a strategic makeover was hard to miss, but other candidates also tried to show voters a fuller version of themselves. Ms. Warren stayed true to her vision for sweeping policy proposals, but she also used the debate, held in the city where she went to college, to talk more about her personal story, which many voters are only dimly aware of. She recalled her Oklahoma youth, repeatedly cited her brothers\u2019 military service and talked about being a public school teacher. If Ms. Warren seemed determined to unfurl her biography, Mr. Sanders came prepared to take on Mr. Biden. The Vermont senator was assertive about drawing contrasts between his progressive credentials and Mr. Biden\u2019s far more varied record. Where Mr. Sanders shied away from direct conflict when he shared a debate stage with Mr. Biden in June, this time he sought out areas of sharp disagreement, including over the NAFTA trade deal and the war in Iraq. Mr. Biden supported both; Mr. Sanders opposed them. [We fact-checked what the candidates said at the Democratic debate.] The Democratic Party\u2019s lively, sometimes heated internal disagreements were on vivid display throughout the night, on subjects as diverse as gun control, trade with China, the war in Afghanistan and the Senate filibuster. And if the clearest philosophical gulf separated Mr. Biden from the prominent populists who flanked him \u2014 Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren \u2014  the debate made plain that the party was in the midst of a far more complex process of defining its identity. The remaining field of candidates arrayed themselves around the same philosophical dividing line, most of them aligning more closely with Mr. Biden. And for the first time in this primary race, a few of the trailing contenders sharpened their attacks. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota derided Mr. Sanders\u2019s single-payer health care bill as a \u201cbad idea,\u201d while Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., accused Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren of seeking to take away choice from consumers. \u201cI trust the American people to make the right choice for them,\u201d Mr. Buttigieg said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you?\u201d A harshly contentious clash between Mr. Biden and Mr. Castro provided one of the most heated exchanges of the evening, at least in terms of political theatrics. Seizing on a moment in which Mr. Biden described his health care proposals imprecisely, Mr. Castro questioned Mr. Biden\u2019s memory \u2014 a charged subject for the former vice president, who is 76. \u201cAre you forgetting already what you said two minutes ago?\u201d Mr. Castro said, prodding insistently before boasting, \u201cI\u2019m fulfilling the legacy of Barack Obama and you\u2019re not.\u201d Mr. Biden shot back, \u201cThat would be a surprise to him.\u201d (The former vice president did, however, show his fondness for a bygone era later in the forum when he dropped in a reference to record players.) There was more consensus on the stage when it came to praising the leadership of former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas in the aftermath of the mass shooting last month in El Paso, his hometown. And Mr. O\u2019Rourke won a booming ovation from the audience when he was asked whether he would try to confiscate some weapons. \u201cHell, yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to allow it to be used against fellow Americans anymore.\u201d Mr. Booker, who lives in Newark, said the outrage over gun violence was long overdue. \u201cI\u2019m sorry that it had to take issues coming to my neighborhood or personally affecting Beto to suddenly make us demand change,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a crisis of empathy in our nation. We are never going to solve this crisis if we have to wait for it to personally affect us or our neighborhood or our community before we demand action.\u201d There were, though, plenty of lighter moments in Houston. Mr. Booker, a vegan, assured viewers he would not push Americans away from eating meat. \u201cFirst of all I want to say: No,\u201d he said, before adding with a touch of comedic timing, \u201cI want to translate that into Spanish: No.\u201d Ms. Harris drew titters for saying Mr. Trump \u201creminds me of that guy in \u2018The Wizard of Oz,\u2019\u201d adding that \u201cwhen you pull back the curtain, it\u2019s a really small dude.\u201d And Andrew Yang left many of his competitors onstage all but speechless when he used his opening statement to unveil a new gambit aimed at drawing attention to his proposal to offer Americans a universal basic income. \u201cMy campaign will now give a freedom dividend of $1,000 a month for an entire year to 10 American families, someone watching this at home right now,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you believe that you can solve your own problems better than any politician, go to yang2020.com and tell us how $1,000 a month will help you do just that.\u201d ",

But even liberal voters who admire the former president prefer to look to the future.By Alexander BurnsPRINT EDITIONDemocrats\u2019 Admiration for Obama Is Leavened by Hunger to Move On|September 21, 2019, Page A23",
      "author": "Alexander Burns",
      "content": " In some of the tensest moments of the 2020 debates, a viewer might have concluded that Democrats were poised for a large-scale clash over the legacy of President Barack Obama. There have been heated arguments about whether to stick with Mr. Obama\u2019s architecture for health care policy or to pursue a single-payer system, and flashes of direct criticism over his record on immigration. In televised debates, Democratic rivals like Juli\u00e1n Castro have pressed his former vice president, Joseph R. Biden Jr., to repudiate the large-scale deportations carried out under Mr. Obama\u2019s watch. There have also been defiant professions of loyalty, delivered as though Mr. Obama were under siege from fellow Democrats. Mr. Biden, the Democratic front-runner, has made these moments a hallmark of his candidacy: \u201cI stand with Barack Obama all eight years, good, bad, indifferent,\u201d he said at the last debate. Yet among the vast majority of Democratic voters, there is little appetite for a brawl over the merits of Mr. Obama\u2019s record. And while Mr. Obama\u2019s consensus-seeking liberalism appeals to many Democratic voters, few appear to be thinking about the 2020 primary as a forum for determining which candidate would follow Mr. Obama\u2019s exact policy blueprint. Interviews with Democratic voters and party leaders found near-unanimous admiration for the former president and his policies, a sense of nostalgia for what they recall as his dignified conduct \u2014\u00a0and, at the same time, a hunger for something new. Mr. Obama remains immensely popular among Democrats: In a poll published Tuesday by NBC News and The Wall Street Journal, nine in 10 Democrats said they viewed him in positive terms. More than three quarters said they believed Mr. Obama \u201cdid as much as was possible at the time in addressing the issues facing the country.\u201d [Which Democrats are leading the 2020 presidential race this week?] Mr. Obama has kept a low profile in the presidential race, meeting privately with many of the Democratic candidates but telling associates that he does not see it as his place to direct the party\u2019s future. He has expressed interest, at different times, in rising stars like former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. Mr. Obama had issued a warm statement about Mr. Biden\u2019s entry into the primary but had declined to endorse him or anyone else. Some of the aura around Mr. Obama surrounds Mr. Biden, too, granting him much of the party\u2019s good will. \u201cHe was with President Obama,\u201d said Tajshiek Nehemiah, 31, who watched Mr. Biden deliver a speech in Birmingham, Ala., last Sunday. \u201cI like the way he spoke as vice president, what he stood for, what he believes.\u201d But Democrats supporting other candidates have no difficulty reconciling that preference with their affection for Mr. Obama. And they do not necessarily connect the social problems the left is most focused on, like economic inequality and health care costs, to the agenda Mr. Obama pursued on those issues. \u201cI love Obama,\u201d Maureen Conboy, a lawyer in New York, said Monday after watching Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts give a speech in Washington Square Park. \u201cHe made mistakes but he\u2019s honest, he really cared \u2014 you could just tell he\u2019s a good person.\u201d Ms. Conboy also said that was the past. \u201cI think re-litigating what happened, making this about Obama, the Obama administration, is the wrong thing,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to look forward, and if it\u2019s Biden, we\u2019re going to do nothing but looking back.\u201d Patrick Dillon, Mr. Obama\u2019s former deputy political director in the White House, said many Democrats shared that mind-set. He said candidates had to offer new ideas, but saw little evidence that skepticism of Mr. Obama was growing. \u201cI think every candidate has to talk about how they\u2019re going to build forward from the Obama legacy,\u201d said Mr. Dillon, who is married to Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign manager but is not working for the campaign. \u201cThe notion of \u2018building on\u2019 seems to have won the conversation, versus the notion of aggressively reassessing or tearing down.\u201d A spokesman for Mr. Obama declined to comment. [Sign up for our politics newsletter hosted by Lisa Lerer and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race.] That any Democrat might consider running as an Obama clone underscores his unusual political stature. No recent former president has enjoyed a comparable glow immediately after leaving office. Even relatively popular presidents were seen as more tainted: for Ronald Reagan, there was Iran-Contra; for Bill Clinton, the lurid ripples of impeachment. Mr. Obama is different, especially for Democrats. If elements of his political ethos have gone out of vogue \u2014 his peacemaking with Wall Street, for instance, or his championing of free-trade agreements \u2014 the Democratic candidates who have departed from his approach have shown no desire to make that split explicit. The two most prominent liberals in the race, Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders, have couched their calls for sweeping policy change within praise for Mr. Obama, all but erasing disagreements they had with him in the past. In demanding a single-payer health care system, they have praised the Affordable Care Act and called \u201cMedicare for All\u201d a logical next step. Whether Mr. Biden can successfully brand that stance as a rejection of Mr. Obama, as he attempted to do at the last debate, remains to be seen. For now, the liberals\u2019 approach has worked with some Democrats in the early-voting states. Zach Simonson, a Democratic county chairman in Wapello County, Iowa, said if Democrats took the view that Mr. Obama \u201cmade zero mistakes, or that he didn\u2019t even leave anything unfinished, then we have nothing to run on but undoing the Trump presidency.\u201d \u201cWe can\u2019t be the party of \u2018Make America 2016 Again,\u2019\u201d Mr. Simonson said. \u201cBeing for hope and change and progress is the best way to carry on the Obama legacy.\u201d JoAnn Hardy, a party leader in Iowa\u2019s Cerro Gordo County, said she saw Mr. Biden as \u201cbest positioned to carry on Obama\u2019s legacy\u201d because of their close relationship. But she said she believed all the candidates had \u201crespect for Obama and his policies.\u201d \u201cI think some of those proposing policies different from Obama are just moving the policies another step toward realization,\u201d Ms. Hardy, who is neutral in the race, said. Blunter criticism of Mr. Obama has been left to more desperate candidates, like Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York City, who have sought traction by courting activists with intense but narrow grievances about Obama-era policies, particularly on immigration, trade and national security. John Anzalone, a pollster for Mr. Biden who worked for Mr. Obama, said there was no strong Democratic constituency for such criticism. According to his research, Mr. Anzalone said, primary voters were pining not just for Mr. Obama as a person but for his steady, pragmatic approach, something he suggested Mr. Biden was well positioned to provide. \u201cThey wish they could get back to the normalcy of someone like Barack Obama,\u201d Mr. Anzalone said. Mr. Obama\u2019s enduring popularity owes much to his status as the first black president of the United States. And Mr. Biden\u2019s standing in the race flows from his role as Mr. Obama\u2019s steadfast defender, with his lead built on strong support from African-Americans. \u201cHe had no problem with defending the president when asked to do so,\u201d said Lashunda Scales, an Alabama Democrat who is president pro tempore of the Jefferson County Commission. She wasn\u2019t making an endorsement, she said, but added, \u201cthat, to me, said a lot about his character.\u201d But African-American voters are far from uniform in preferring Mr. Biden, or in seeing the primaries as a referendum on Mr. Obama. Elizabeth Bowens, a retired hospitality worker in Myrtle Beach, S.C., said that she disliked the contentious tone of the Democratic race and that she longed for the Obama years. \u201cHim and Michelle, that\u2019s a beautiful couple,\u201d she said. But Ms. Bowens did not seem to be leaning toward Mr. Biden. \u201cIt\u2019s time for a woman,\u201d she said. To Mr. Obama\u2019s sharpest critics on the left \u2014 chiefly activists and policy experts concerned with issues like financial regulation, drone warfare, immigration and criminal justice \u2014 his Teflon reputation can be frustrating. Matt Stoller, a fellow at the liberal Open Markets Institute who is a scathing critic of Mr. Obama\u2019s economic record, said he saw Democrats as caught between their personal reverence for Mr. Obama and the reality that the country faces \u201cexistential crises\u201d \u2014 on matters like climate change and economic inequality \u2014 that Mr. Obama did not resolve. At some point, Mr. Stoller said, Democrats might face a stark choice between Mr. Obama\u2019s center-left policy framework and the agendas of liberal candidates they now favor. But Mr. Stoller acknowledged no such test had yet arrived. \u201cI\u2019m still waiting for that moment when Democrats are going to have to make that choice,\u201d he said. There is no guarantee that it will ever arrive. And the choice Democratic primary voters see before them now has less to do with Mr. Obama\u2019s policies than with the immediate challenge of ousting President Trump. Susan Chase, a retiree in Southport, N.C., said candidates who attacked Mr. Obama would not get her vote, and she criticized Senator Kamala Harris for attacking Mr. Biden in the first debate. But that does not mean she will vote for Mr. Biden. \u201cPart of me says it\u2019s time for something really new and different,\u201d Ms. Chase said, \u201cbut then the other part says we\u2019ve got to have somebody who can beat Trump.\u201d",

      "author": "Michael D. Shear",
      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump has decided to slash the American refugee program by almost half, greatly dimming the United States\u2019 role in accepting persecuted refugees from most parts of the world, the State Department announced Thursday. The administration said it would accept 18,000 refugees during the next 12 months, down from the current limit of 30,000 and a fraction of the 110,000 President Barack Obama said should be allowed into the United States in 2016, his final year in office. Even that low figure may overstate the number of slots that could be open for unanticipated crises, since many of the openings have been allocated. The Trump administration will reserve 4,000 refugee slots for Iraqis who worked with the United States military, 1,500 for people from Central America and 5,000 for people persecuted for their religion, senior administration officials said. The additional 7,500 slots are for those who are seeking family unification and have been cleared for resettlement. That will eliminate many opportunities for people fleeing war and persecution throughout the world to resettle in the United States, which until Mr. Trump took office was the world\u2019s leading destination for refugees. Administration officials said the change was merely to accommodate that huge increase in people seeking asylum, 350,000 expected in all. The total influx then could reach 368,000. \u201cPresident Trump is prioritizing the safety and security of the American people by making sure we do not admit more people than we can vet,\u201d the administration said Thursday evening. Religious and humanitarian groups reacted harshly. Jennifer Sime, a senior vice president at International Rescue Committee, a humanitarian organization, said the order broke with 40 years or precedent. \u201cThis measure completely ignores the welcome that communities have provided to refugees, as well as the important contributions resettled refugees have made to these communities all across the country,\u201d Ms. Sime said. The Rev. John L. McCullough, president of Church World Service, a resettlement agency, declared, \u201cWith one final blow, the Trump administration has snuffed out Lady Liberty\u2019s torch and ended our nation\u2019s legacy of compassion and welcome.\u201d The cap is not the only change that could limit refugee entries. The number admitted into the United States will also depend on the jurisdictions that choose to accept them. President Trump signed an executive order requiring state and local governments to provide written consent to the federal government in order for them to accept refugees. The administration will also no longer have carve-outs for specific regions of the world, with the exception of three Central American countries. Last year, the United States accepted 11,000 people from Africa, 4,000 from East Asia, 3,000 from Europe and Central Asia, 3,000 from Latin America and the Caribbean, and 9,000 from Southeast Asia. Mr. Trump\u2019s decision is part of a broader effort, led by Stephen Miller, a White House adviser and architect of the president\u2019s immigration agenda, to reduce the number of legal and illegal immigrants flowing into the country. Mr. Miller and his allies in the administration argue that the drastic reduction of the refugee program is required because of the increase in the number of asylum seekers trying to enter the United States at the Mexican border. There is a backlog of almost one million cases in the immigration courts in the United States, many of which are asylum seekers. On a conference call with reporters, senior administration officials argued that the administration\u2019s resources are better spent processing those cases than bringing more refugees into the United States. \u201cThe current burdens on the U.S. immigration system must be alleviated before it is again possible to resettle large number of refugees,\u201d the State Department said in a news release. \u201cPrioritizing the humanitarian protection cases of those already in our country is simply a matter of fairness and common sense.\u201d But critics of the administration say that the asylum situation at the southwestern border should not be an excuse for abandoning potential refugees from hot spots around the world. They point out that the backlog in the immigration courts is largely the result of cases where the asylum seekers\u2019 requests need to be evaluated. Most refugees who arrive in the United States have already been screened and vetted before they arrive. The critics note that the United States was able to process close to 30,000 refugees in the current year even as the number of asylum cases rose in the spring. Administration officials said they had to take tough steps to limit refugees because they were dealing with an ongoing crisis at the southern border. But that crisis appears to be abating. Apprehensions at the border have declined since more than 144,200 migrants were taken into custody in May, the highest monthly total in 13 years. Border authorities arrested more than 64,000 migrants at the southwestern border. Most of those migrants crossing the border are fleeing gang violence and persecution in Central America, raising questions over whether the 1,500 refugees allotted for the region will be nearly sufficient. The acting secretary of Homeland Security, Kevin McAleenan, has also signed separate deals with Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador that would require most migrants to apply for asylum in that country in an effort to keep the migrants from journeying to the United States. But those countries are still plagued by violence and corruption, and advocates have said they are not equipped to shield those seeking protections. Advocates and immigration lawyers also say the administration is abandoning a moral duty by the United States to be a world leader in the effort to help people in dire situations. They argue that other countries take their cue from the actions of American presidents. \u201cThe shockingly low refugee admissions goal and the executive order will all but ensure that people in need of safety will be left in dangerous conditions and separated from their families,\u201d said Betsy Fisher, the director of strategy for the International Refugee Assistance Project. \u201cThese policies will prevent refugees from being resettled, even though communities across the nation stand ready to welcome them.\u201d",

      "author": "Peter Baker",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 One day in October 1992, four Republican congressmen showed up in the Oval Office with an audacious recommendation. President George Bush was losing his re-election race, and they told him the only way to win was to hammer his challenger Bill Clinton\u2019s patriotism for protesting the Vietnam War while in London and visiting Moscow as a young man. Mr. Bush was largely on board with that approach. But what came next crossed the line, as far as he and his team were concerned. \u201cThey wanted us to contact the Russians or the British to seek information on Bill Clinton\u2019s trip to Moscow,\u201d James A. Baker III, Mr. Bush\u2019s White House chief of staff, wrote in a memo later that day. \u201cI said we absolutely could not do that.\u201d President Trump insists he and his attorney general did nothing wrong by seeking damaging information about his domestic opponents from Ukraine, Australia, Italy and Britain or by publicly calling on China to investigate his most prominent Democratic challenger. But for every other White House in the modern era, Republican and Democratic, the idea of enlisting help from foreign powers for political advantage was seen as unwise and politically dangerous, if not unprincipled. A survey of 10 former White House chiefs of staff under Presidents Ronald Reagan, Bush, Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama found that none recalled any circumstance under which the White House had solicited or accepted political help from other countries, and all said they would have considered the very idea out of bounds. \u201cI served three presidents in the White House and don\u2019t remember even hearing any speculation to consider asking for such action,\u201d said Andrew H. Card Jr., who ran the younger Mr. Bush\u2019s White House and was the longest-serving chief of staff in the last six decades. William M. Daley, who served as commerce secretary under Mr. Clinton and chief of staff under Mr. Obama, said if someone had even proposed such an action, he probably would \u201crecommend the person be escorted out of\u201d the White House, then fired and reported to ethics officials. Other chiefs were just as definitive. \u201cDid not happen on Reagan\u2019s watch. Would not have happened on Reagan\u2019s watch,\u201d said Kenneth M. Duberstein, his last chief of staff. \u201cI would have shut him down,\u201d said Leon E. Panetta, who served as Mr. Clinton\u2019s chief of staff and Mr. Obama\u2019s defense secretary. The sense of incredulity among White House veterans in recent days crossed party and ideological lines. \u201cThis is unprecedented,\u201d said Samuel K. Skinner, who preceded Mr. Baker as chief of staff under Mr. Bush. Other chiefs who said they never encountered such a situation included Thomas F. McLarty III and John D. Podesta (Clinton) and Rahm Emanuel, Denis R. McDonough and Jacob J. Lew (Obama). History has shown that foreign affairs can be treacherous for presidents, even just the suspicion of mixing politics with the national interest. As a candidate in 1968, Richard M. Nixon sought to forestall a Vietnam peace deal by President Lyndon B. Johnson just before the election. Associates of Mr. Reagan were accused of trying to delay the release of hostages by Iran when he was a candidate in 1980 for fear that it would aid President Jimmy Carter, but a bipartisan House investigation concluded that there was no merit to the charge. Mr. Clinton faced months of investigation over 1996 campaign contributions from Chinese interests tied to the Beijing government. In none of those cases did an incumbent president personally apply pressure to foreign powers to damage political opponents. Mr. Trump pressed Ukraine\u2019s president this summer to investigate involvement with Democrats in 2016 and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. while holding up $391 million in American aid. Mr. Trump has said he was simply investigating corruption, not trying to benefit himself. \u201cThe right way to look at it is the vice president was selling our country out,\u201d Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, said in an interview on Sunday. Mr. Trump was fulfilling his duty, he said. \u201cI don\u2019t see what the president did wrong.\u201d Mr. Giuliani has been leading Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to dig up evidence of corruption by the Democrats in Ukraine, meeting with various officials and negotiating a commitment by the newly installed government in Kiev to investigate conspiracy theories about Ukrainian involvement in the 2016 election and supposed conflicts of interest by Mr. Biden. Told that past White House chiefs of staff said any legitimate allegations should be handled by the Justice Department, not the president, Mr. Giuliani said: \u201cThat\u2019s if you can trust the Justice Department. My witnesses don\u2019t trust the Justice Department, and they don\u2019t trust the F.B.I.\u201d He added that he would not have either until Attorney General William P. Barr took over. Mr. Barr has contacted foreign officials for help in investigating the origin of the special counsel investigation by Robert S. Mueller III into Russian interference and ties with Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, part of an effort to prove that the whole matter was a \u201choax,\u201d as the president has insisted. Mr. Trump defends himself by saying that other presidents have leaned on foreign governments for help. That is true, but when other presidents have pressured counterparts and even held up American assistance to coerce cooperation, it has generally been to achieve certain policy goals \u2014 not to advance the president\u2019s personal or political agenda. As an example, Mr. Trump often cites Mr. Obama, who was overheard telling President Dmitri Medvedev of Russia in 2012 that he would have more \u201cmore flexibility\u201d to negotiate missile defense after the fall election. While that may be objectionable, it is not the same thing as asking a foreign government to intervene in an American election. \u201cThey assume everybody\u2019s as sleazy and dirty as they are, which is not the case,\u201d Mr. Emanuel said. Mr. Trump points to Mr. Biden, arguing that the former vice president was the one who abused his power by threatening to withhold $1 billion in American aid to Ukraine unless it fired its prosecutor general. Mr. Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden served on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company, earning $50,000 a month. The company\u2019s oligarch owner, Mykola Zlochevsky, had been a subject of cases overseen by the prosecutor, and so Mr. Trump contends that Mr. Biden sought the prosecutor\u2019s ouster to benefit his son. As a matter of appearances, at least, the former vice president\u2019s family left him open to suspicion. Even some of his defenders say it was unseemly for Hunter Biden to seemingly trade on his family name. The elder Mr. Biden has said he never discussed his son\u2019s business dealings in Ukraine with him, but some Democrats suggest he should have if only to prevent just such a situation from arising. For all of that, however, no evidence has emerged that Mr. Biden moved to push out the prosecutor to benefit his son. No memo or text message has become public linking the two. None of the American officials who were involved at the time have come forward alleging any connection. No whistle-blower has filed a complaint. In pressing for the prosecutor\u2019s ouster, Mr. Biden was carrying out Mr. Obama\u2019s policy as developed by his national security team and coordinated with European allies and the International Monetary Fund, all of which considered the Ukrainian prosecutor to be deliberately overlooking corruption. Indeed, at the time Mr. Biden acted, there was no public evidence that the prosecutor\u2019s office was actively pursuing investigations of Burisma, although Mr. Zlochevsky\u2019s allies say the prosecutor continued to use the threat of prosecution to try to solicit bribes from the oligarch and his team. The 1992 episode involving Mr. Bush and Mr. Baker provides an intriguing case study in the way previous administrations have viewed seeking political help overseas. At the time, Mr. Bush was trailing in the polls and eager for any weapon to turn things around. Representatives Robert K. Dornan, Duncan Hunter and Duke Cunningham of California and Sam Johnson of Texas urged the president to ask Russia and Britain for help. Mr. Dornan, reached last week, said Mr. Baker offered no objections during the meeting. \u201cBaker sat there in the Oval Office like a bump on a log,\u201d he recalled. \u201cHe said nothing.\u201d If Mr. Baker advised Mr. Bush not to reach out to foreign governments, then he did so after the congressmen had left, Mr. Dornan said. Mr. Dornan said that was a mistake and that Mr. Bush should have done as Mr. Trump has. \u201cThe bottom line from me was, \u2018If you don\u2019t do this, Mr. President, leader of the free world, you will lose,\u2019\u201d Mr. Dornan said. \u201cAnd he didn\u2019t do it and he lost. Baker cost Bush that second term.\u201d As it was, Mr. Baker and some of his aides got in trouble anyway because State Department employees searched Mr. Clinton\u2019s passport file to determine whether he had ever tried to renounce his American citizenship. They found no such evidence, but an independent counsel was appointed to investigate whether the search violated any laws. The attorney general who requested the investigation? Mr. Barr, in his first tour running the Justice Department. The independent counsel who was appointed? Joseph diGenova, a lawyer now helping Mr. Giuliani look for information in Ukraine. In the passport case, Mr. diGenova concluded that no laws had been broken and that he should never have been appointed in first place. As for seeking help from Russia and Britain, Mr. Baker declined to comment last week, but his peers said he did exactly as they would have. \u201cIt would have been ludicrous at that stage to do anything,\u201d Mr. Skinner said. \u201cBaker\u2019s decision was obviously the right one.\u201d",

      "author": "Annie Karni",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump may have reversed his decision to host world leaders at one of his own properties during next year\u2019s Group of 7 summit at the urging of his fellow Republicans, but he hasn\u2019t finished defending his right to do it in the first place. Mr. Trump on Monday dismissed what he called the \u201cphony emoluments clause\u201d of the Constitution that prohibits a president from illegally profiting from his business while in office and was cited by critics of his choice of Trump National Doral Miami for the summit. He also accused President Barack Obama of trying to profit off the presidency. \u201cDoral was a very simple situation,\u201d the president told reporters at the White House. \u201cI own a property in Florida. I was going to do it at no cost or give it free if I got a ruling, because there is a question as to whether or not you\u2019re allowed to give it, because it\u2019s like a contribution to a country.\u201d Mr. Trump said Democrats had gone \u201ccrazy\u201d over the prospect of hosting an international summit at a Trump property, when in fact it was private criticism from Republicans that ultimately forced his rare reversal. And he continued to talk up the resort, with its \u201cmassive meeting rooms\u201d and \u201cbest location\u201d and said that \u201cit would have been the greatest G-7 ever.\u201d Mr. Trump then toggled to what he believes inoculates him against charges of trying to profit from his presidency: that he doesn\u2019t take a salary. \u201cThey actually say that George Washington may have been the only other president to do\u201d that, he said. \u201cSee whether or not all of the other of your favorites gave up their salary.\u201d In fact both Herbert Hoover and John F. Kennedy also donated their salaries while they were president. Mr. Trump claimed that when he was elected, he put \u201call the stuff in trusts,\u201d referring to the family business, the Trump Organization, and has left running the business to his sons Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. In fact, Mr. Trump remains closely tied to his real estate empire, and has resisted calls to sell his assets and put the proceeds in a blind trust, arguing that he is under no legal obligation to do so. Mr. Trump also repeated a claim that he was losing, not earning, money from his presidency, and estimated that it had cost him between $2 and $5 billion to enter politics. \u201cDoral was setting records when I bought it,\u201d he said. \u201cThen what happened? I announce I\u2019m going to run for office, right? And I say, We've got to build a wall, we\u2019ve got to have borders, we\u2019ve got to have this, we\u2019ve got to have that. All of a sudden, some people didn\u2019t like it.\u201d Mr. Trump said George Washington had continued to run a business while he was president and used two desks, one for business and one for the presidency in dismissing \u201cthis phony emoluments clause.\u201d He attacked Mr. Obama for a multiyear deal with Netflix and a book deal, both of which were announced after he left office. \u201cObama made a deal for a book. Is that running a business?\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI\u2019m sure he didn\u2019t even discuss it while he was president. He has a deal with Netflix. When did they start talking about that?\u201d Mr. Obama\u2019s contracts with a domestic publisher and movie studio, however, are not directly comparable to taking money from foreign governments. Seated in the Cabinet Room, Mr. Trump also addressed another of his recent announcements that has been criticized by Republicans \u2014 the pullback of American troops in Syria that set the stage for Turkey\u2019s invasion of land controlled by the Kurds, who are an American ally. \u201cWe never agreed to protect the Kurds,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe never agreed to protect the Kurds for the rest of their lives.\u201d",

The Top Tier Is All White.Trailing in the money race, tripped up by their own missteps and perceived by some as less electable, nonwhite candidates find themselves well back of the leaders.By Astead W. Herndon and Jonathan MartinPRINT EDITIONDemocrats Have Diverse Field, But the Top Tier Is All White|October 30, 2019, Page A1",
      "author": "Astead W. Herndon",
      "content": "  When the Democratic primary contest began last winter, it featured the most racially diverse field in history, with two black senators, a Latino former cabinet secretary, an Asian-American businessman and the first American Samoan elected to Congress. But 10 months later, the Democratic field has a top tier of four white candidates, three of them men. Candidates of color are languishing in the low single digits in polls, well behind the four leaders \u2014 former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. The divide could become even more pronounced in the coming months: Because of new, more rigorous thresholds for the Democratic debate in December, it is possible that only one nonwhite candidate, Senator Kamala Harris of California, will qualify. With the Iowa caucuses three months away, it\u2019s a noticeable sorting of the field for an increasingly multiracial party, whose most recent White House victories were powered by a strong minority turnout for a black nominee. It has frustrated the Democrats seeking a more diverse party leadership \u2014 not to mention the affected candidates. \u201cI\u2019ve had lots of crazy things said to me, like, \u2018Is America ready for another black president?\u2019\u201d Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey said in an interview. \u201cAnd I\u2019m confident it\u2019s never been asked of a white candidate, \u2018Is America ready for another white president?\u2019\u201d The emergence of an all-white top tier reflects a combination of factors at the intersection of race, money and politics. Financial support from mostly white, educated elites has helped propel the candidacies of Ms. Warren and Mr. Buttigieg, while two nonwhite candidates \u2014 Mr. Booker and Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former housing secretary \u2014 have had to explicitly petition supporters for money to stay in the race. Assumptions about which candidates can or can\u2019t beat President Trump have also hurt minority candidates, with some Democrats fearing that the white working class voters who helped propel Mr. Trump to the White House would not support a nonwhite nominee.  Donors for Mr. Booker and Ms. Harris have argued that such implicit bias causes voters and pundits to treat Mr. Buttigieg as the natural heir to Mr. Biden\u2019s moderate coalition, though their candidates perform better among older black voters, the Democrats\u2019 most loyal moderate voting block. Other Democrats, however, say the blame rests with the candidates themselves. None of the nonwhite challengers have been able to forge a strong coalition or peel away black voters from Mr. Biden. Some voters and elected officials, white and nonwhite alike, now say privately what the polling suggests: They have not been swept off their feet by any of the candidates of color. Theodore Johnson, who studies African-American politics at the Brennan Center for Justice, said the nonwhite contenders, fairly or not, are suffering in comparison to the country\u2019s first black president. \u201cTheir road is easier because of Obama, but their ability to secure the nomination is harder because they\u2019re not Obama,\u201d said Mr. Johnson. Miscalculations along the way have not helped. Ms. Harris has been criticized for waffling on policy, Mr. Booker for timidness and Mr. Castro for a failed debate attack on Mr. Biden in September, which cost him the endorsement of one of his few Congressional allies. Mr. Castro, in an interview, zeroed in on \u201celectability\u201d as a problem, saying that concept has created an unspoken skepticism of nonwhite candidates among Democratic voters. People with this viewpoint, he said, can sometimes see nonwhite candidates as vice-presidential options, but not best equipped to lead the party. \u201cIn every election there\u2019s a current, and the current this year seems to be running toward candidates that people believe can take Donald Trump on with a certain profile of voter \u2014 the white working class in the Midwest,\u201d said Mr. Castro, whose polling support is running at about 1 percent. And, he added, \u201cassumptions are being made on who the best type of candidates are to do that.\u201d Mr. Booker said he thinks the tide will turn as more people seek a strong candidate to replace Mr. Biden as the moderate alternative to Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders. The trouble: getting enough financial support over the next two months to remain viable. \u201cI have to say these last few weeks, a lot of \u2014 a lot more people seem to be coming around,\u201d Mr. Booker said, \u201cand I think some of this might be because they\u2019re seeing some weakness to Biden.\u201d Aimee Allison, founder of She the People, the network of women of color looking to mobilize for the 2020 general election, said it was too early to rule out unforeseen shifts in the race\u2019s current pecking order. But she added that it would take more than an argument for racial representation to win over voters of color and rise in the polls. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had choices like this before, and that makes essentialism less important,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s diversity of opinion. Women of color are sophisticated voters and organizers. We understand that our power and influence can be felt through a candidate of any race and gender with our agenda.\u201d Any assessment of the performance of nonwhite candidates is complicated by Mr. Biden\u2019s enduring appeal with black voters. The former vice president remains popular from his time in the White House serving with President Barack Obama, and he benefits from the perception among many Democrats that he has the best chance to win back white voters who flipped to Mr. Trump. That popularity with African-Americans has helped keep Mr. Biden at or near the lead in the race for months, while preventing candidates like Mr. Booker and Ms. Harris from making inroads in states like South Carolina. One recent poll gave Mr. Biden a 17-point lead over his closest rivals in the state, propelled by the support of about 40 percent of black voters. Even left wing activists who prefer other candidates acknowledge Mr. Biden\u2019s advantage will be difficult to overcome. \u201cLike many black homes in America, my parents\u2019 home has an Obama shrine,\u201d said Tamika Gadsden, a South Carolina-based activist who likes Ms. Warren and Mr. Castro but whose parents side solidly with Mr. Biden. If Mr. Biden falters in predominantly white states that vote earlier, there\u2019s no guarantee that black voters will desert him \u2014 or that their support would automatically go to the race\u2019s black candidates. And the white candidates positioning themselves as moderate alternatives to Mr. Biden, like Mr. Buttigieg and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, have posted dismal numbers with nonwhite voters. Likewise, the candidates vying for the progressive lane, Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders, still face heavy skepticism among the older black voters. \u201cIt\u2019s still early,\u201d said Representative Karen Bass of California, the head of the Congressional Black Caucus, \u201cI don\u2019t take the top four as the fait accompli.\u201d Ms. Warren, of course, would be barrier-breaking in her own right as the first woman to be president, as would Mr. Buttigieg, an openly gay man. Both have risen to the top tier of early-state and national polls, and both are flush with cash from a largely white donor network that has assured them of long term viability. Together, Mr. Sanders, Ms. Warren, Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg have $90 million in cash on hand. Ms. Harris, Mr. Booker, Mr. Castro, Andrew Yang, the Asian-American entrepreneur, and Tulsi Gabbard, the American-Samoan Congresswoman, have about $24 million combined. Mr. Booker and Mr. Castro have, in recent weeks, had to make desperate hat-in-hand pleas for money just to stay in the race, and both received online boosts from prominent black and Latino politicians including Stacey Abrams of Georgia and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, who alluded to the importance of racial representation.  The race could quickly change before voting begins in February. Ms. Harris has more money in the bank, and more endorsements from the Congressional Black Caucus, than Mr. Biden. Mr. Castro has not qualified for the November debate, but Mr. Booker and Ms. Harris have \u2014 and will have more opportunities to catch fire ahead of the Iowa caucuses, which will reshape all expectations in a single night. Conversely, while none of the leading white candidates have proved they can forge a multiracial coalition, they still have time to make inroads. Ms. Warren has gained good will from black and Latino progressives for infusing her policy proposals with planks about racial equity. Mr. Sanders has a vast and diverse donor base, and recently won endorsements from three of the country\u2019s most prominent minority lawmakers, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and Representatives Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan. Ms. Harris, Mr. Castro, and Mr. Booker are inhibited in part because they came up through the Democratic establishment, and have faced criticism for legislative records that are viewed as out of step with the ascendant progressive wing. Mr. Castro, in response, has tried to remake himself as a progressive champion, and even disavowed some of the deportation actions of Mr. Obama\u2019s administration, in which he served. Ms. Harris and Mr. Booker have tried to toe a more careful line, in hopes they can win more moderate black voters should Mr. Biden falter. Mr. Booker has been attacked for his closeness to big donors and mixed police reform record as mayor of Newark. Ms. Harris\u2019s lack of clarity on policy has drawn fire, both from left-wing activists upset with her record as a prosecutor and centrists annoyed that she backed left-wing ideas such as the Green New Deal. Because of this, some black and Latino Democrats push back on the idea that it\u2019s racism or assumptions about electability that have hindered Ms. Booker, Ms. Harris and Mr. Castro. Privately they claim that some nonwhite Democrats who decided not to run, such as Ms. Abrams of Georgia or Andrew Gillum of Florida, would have been stronger candidates. \u201cIt boils down to the candidates themselves,\u201d said Representative Filemon Vela of Texas. \u201cThose structural barriers existed when President Obama ran.\u201d Mr. Vela, for his part, is backing Mr. Biden, convinced that he\u2019s best suited to defeat Mr. Trump. But he thinks a woman of color should be on the ticket and he has one in mind: Senator Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada.",

      "author": "Michael Crowley",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump told a gathering of police chiefs in Chicago that his predecessors should have killed the murderous Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who blew himself up during an American raid on his compound in Syria on Saturday. \u201cHe should have been killed years ago, another president should have gotten him,\u201d Mr. Trump said of the ISIS chief. A day after he formally announced the most high-profile American counterterrorism action since the 2011 killing of the Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, Mr. Trump continued to revel in its success, and reprised his blunt language from a day earlier. \u201cHe was a sick and depraved man and now he\u2019s dead \u2014 he\u2019s dead as a doornail,\u201d Trump said of Mr. al-Baghdadi, drawing some laughter from his audience. \u201cAnd he didn\u2019t die bravely, I can tell you that.\u201d In a typically freewheeling speech to the annual conference of the International Association of Chiefs of Police that lasted more than an hour, Mr. Trump struck a stern law-and-order tone as he lashed out at the city\u2019s police chief, condemned local gun violence, railed against illegal immigrants, and denounced an apparently staged assault on the actor Jussie Smollett. Mr. Trump said that Mr. Smollett, who made a questionable claim last year that he was assaulted in Chicago by Trump supporters in red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats, \u201cbeat himself up.\u201d (Mr. Smollett was charged with filing a false police report before the charges against him were dropped as part of a deal with prosecutors.) Mr. Trump drew an unlikely line between Mr. Smollett\u2019s alleged hoax and the House Democratic inquiry now underway against him back in Washington. \u201cIt\u2019s a scam, just like the impeachment of your president is a scam,\u201d Mr. Trump said. Mr. Trump did not explain how exactly his predecessors had failed in their pursuit of Mr. al-Baghdadi. The ISIS leader was imprisoned by American forces in Iraq in 2004, during the administration of George W. Bush, but was seen as an insignificant figure at the time. He was released after less than a year and then dropped out of view for several years. United States officials did not appreciate his import as an insurgent leader until 2009, early in the administration of President Barack Obama. Mr. al-Baghdadi became a top target of American forces deployed by Mr. Obama to Iraq and Syria after he led ISIS\u2019s seizure of large swaths of territory in those countries in 2014. And United States officials say that Mr. Trump\u2019s abrupt withdrawal of American troops from northeastern Syria earlier this month had complicated planning already underway for the treacherous raid on Mr. al-Baghdadi. But his critique echoes that of the mother of Kayla Mueller, a young American aid worker who was abducted in Syria in 2013 and enslaved and raped by Mr. al-Baghdadi. She was killed under murky circumstances in February 2015. \u201cI still say Kayla should be here, and if Obama had been as decisive as President Trump, maybe she would have been,\u201d Ms. Mueller\u2019s mother, Marsha Mueller, told The Arizona Republic on Sunday. Mr. Trump also reprised past criticisms of Chicago\u2019s Democratic political establishment, pointing to the city\u2019s long-running epidemic of gun violence. \u201cAll over the world they\u2019re talking about Chicago,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cAfghanistan is a safe place by comparison.\u201d Mr. Trump noted that Chicago\u2019s police superintendent, Eddie T. Johnson, was not in attendance. Last week, Mr. Johnson released a statement saying that he could not \u201cin good conscience stand by while racial insults and hatred are cast from the Oval Office or Chicago is held hostage because of our views on new Americans.\u201d Mr. Trump repeatedly insulted Mr. Johnson by name, in some cases drawing applause. \u201cHe\u2019s not doing his job,\u201d Mr. Trump said, citing the city\u2019s homicide rate. Writing on Twitter shortly after Mr. Trump spoke, Chicago\u2019s mayor, Lori E. Lightfoot, denounced his \u201cinsulting, ignorant buffoonery.\u201d \u201cRather than belittle Chicago\u2019s communities with hateful and dishonest rhetoric, he needs to go back to D.C. and face his fate,\u201d Ms. Lightfoot wrote, adding that she stood by Mr. Johnson. Mr. Trump was introduced at the event by the president of the police chiefs group, Paul Cell, who called him \u201cthe strongest supporter of law enforcement that this profession has ever seen.\u201d After his remarks, Mr. Trump headed to a round table with supporters and a private fund-raising lunch at the Trump International Hotel and Tower in downtown Chicago. He was scheduled to return to Washington in the afternoon for a Halloween event on the South Lawn of the White House.",

      "author": "Peter Baker",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Former President Barack Obama, who has remained largely silent amid the convulsive impeachment debate now gripping the nation, offered a tribute to a late Democratic congressman on Friday that sounded to some listeners like an implicit rebuke of President Trump. Speaking at a service for Representative Elijah E. Cummings, who died last week, Mr. Obama never mentioned the president by name but seemed to draw a contrast between his successor and the congressman whom Mr. Trump denigrated last summer. Mr. Obama said that Mr. Cummings showed that being strong meant being kind and that being honorable was no flaw. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing weak about kindness and compassion,\u201d Mr. Obama told a packed hall at New Psalmist Baptist Church in Baltimore, which Mr. Cummings, a Democrat, represented in the House for the past 25 years. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing weak about looking out for others. There\u2019s nothing weak about being honorable. You\u2019re not a sucker to have integrity and to treat others with respect.\u201d Warming to his topic, Mr. Obama pointed to a sign behind him referring to \u201cthe Honorable\u201d Mr. Cummings. \u201cThis is a title that we confer on all kinds of people who get elected to public office,\u201d he said as the largely African-American and Democratic audience responded with knowing applause and laughter. \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to introduce them as honorable. But Elijah Cummings was honorable before he was elected to office. There\u2019s a difference. There\u2019s a difference if you were honorable and treated others honorably outside the limelight.\u201d As chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, Mr. Cummings, 68, had become a major thorn in Mr. Trump\u2019s side and was one of the leaders of the drive to impeach the president for abuse of power. Last summer, Mr. Trump lashed out at Mr. Cummings, calling him \u201cracist\u201d and \u201ca brutal bully\u201d who had done \u201ca very poor job\u201d representing a district that he described as a \u201cdisgusting, rat and rodent infested mess.\u201d Mr. Obama was part of an all-star lineup of speakers and guests at the Friday\u2019s service, including former President Bill Clinton, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Elizabeth Warren. But much of the attention was focused on the 44th president, who has largely avoided weighing in lately on his successor even as Mr. Trump lately has repeatedly accused Mr. Obama of illegally spying on him while in office and blamed the former president for various policy setbacks. Mr. Obama made no reference to any of that, but did call on his audience to step up as Mr. Cummings did. \u201cPeople will look back at this moment,\u201d he said, \u201cand ask the question: What did you do?\u201d",

      "author": "Annie Karni",
      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 From the moment President Trump learned that Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State, had been killed in a commando raid in Syria, he handled the news in an unusual way. \u201cSomething very big just happened!\u201d Mr. Trump teased on Twitter Saturday night around 9:30 p.m., just hours after American forces had landed in the region. An hour or so later, after convincing Mr. Trump that waiting until the morning to elaborate on his cryptic Twitter message was a better way to steer the news that would dominate the Sunday talk shows, the president\u2019s aides announced a rare Sunday morning presidential address from the White House. The Diplomatic Reception Room setting gave Mr. Trump the kind of made-for-television presidential moment he has long craved \u2014 a parallel to President Barack Obama\u2019s late-night announcement in 2011 that Osama bin Laden had been killed \u2014 at a time when he has been eager for a story line outside of impeachment and a way to counter the narrative that he had been outmaneuvered by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey in ordering American troops out of Syria. He spoke for 48 minutes, first reading a statement and then answering questions from reporters in a rambling news conference. He described the raid that killed Mr. al-Baghdadi in graphic terms and belittled the ISIS leader as having \u201cdied after running into a dead end tunnel, whimpering and crying and screaming all the way,\u201d and that he \u201cdied like a dog,\u201d one of Mr. Trump\u2019s favorite invectives. Mr. al-Baghdadi\u2019s ISIS followers, the president said, were \u201cfrightened puppies\u201d and \u201closers,\u201d the same language he has used to describe former political rivals like Senator Ted Cruz and media outlets like CNN. And the president appeared to elevate the significance of the raid over the one in which bin Laden was killed eight years ago \u2014 an event that unfolded the same night that Mr. Obama ruthlessly mocked Mr. Trump at the White House Correspondents Dinner. \u201cAl-Baghdadi everybody hears about, because he\u2019s built this monster for a long time,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cBut nobody ever heard of Osama bin Laden until really the World Trade Center.\u201d White House aides viewed the success of the raid as a major political victory for Mr. Trump at a tenuous juncture in his presidency. And for the president, it had the potential to overshadow one of Mr. Obama\u2019s legacies, and earn Mr. Trump the kind of plaudits he believes are unfairly reserved for other presidents. Mr. Trump was returning from his golf course in Sterling, Va., where he had played with Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and David Perdue of Georgia, as well as Rob Manfred, the Major League Baseball commissioner, on Saturday afternoon, as the raid in Syria began. After returning to the White House at around 4:15 p.m., Mr. Trump changed and went to the Situation Room, where he was joined by Vice President Mike Pence; Robert C. O\u2019Brien, his national security adviser; Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper; and General Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, among others, to witness the raid unfold. Reports of military action in Syria began circulating on social media, prompting the president to make the first official public acknowledgment on Twitter that \u201csomething big\u201d was unfolding. By that time, Mr. Trump was back in the East Wing with a handful of aides who convinced him to wait until the morning for a fuller explanation of what had taken place. He decided against notifying House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other congressional leaders on Saturday night, Mr. Trump said at his news conference on Sunday, because \u201cWashington leaks like I\u2019ve never seen before\u201d and he did not want the information to get out. \u201cThere\u2019s no country in the world that leaks like we do.\u201d On Sunday morning, Mr. Trump invited Mr. Graham back to the White House to attend his announcement, which was delayed by about 30 minutes because he was still working on his remarks with Stephen Miller and his other speechwriters. Mr. Trump, who has long resisted efforts from aides to address the nation from the Oval Office, agreed to the Diplomatic Reception Room as the setting for what he wanted to be a legacy-defining moment. And, there, he continued to underscore his competition with Mr. Obama by speaking at length about what he said were his own premonitions about Bin Laden, rather than focusing on the events of the day. He repeated the misleading claim that he delivered a warning about Bin Laden in one of his books. \u201cNobody listened to me,\u201d Mr. Trump lamented. \u201cTo this day, I get people coming up to me, and they said \u2018you know one of the most amazing things I\u2019ve seen about you is that you predicted that Osama bin Laden had to be killed before he knocked down the World Trade Center.\u2019\u201d In reality, Mr. Trump\u2019s book, \u201cThe America We Deserve,\u201d makes one passing reference to Bin Laden, where he is simply referred to as \u201cpublic enemy No. 1.\u201d But on Sunday morning, Mr. Trump took credit not only for the raid that killed Mr. a-Baghdadi, but also for having been wiser than his predecessors. \u201cI made a prediction,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s put it this way. If they would have listened to me, a lot of things would have been different.\u201d From his implicit undermining of Mr. Obama to his focus on the fact that he has never received the credit he deserves, Mr. Trump handled the moment in a familiar way: putting himself at the center of the action, releasing information such as the number of helicopters involved in the operation that are normally classified, and focusing on vivid, cinematic details of a raid he bragged unfolded \u201cas though you were watching a movie.\u201d All presidents make military victories their own, but for Mr. Trump, that movie was a lot about him. Recalling the scene Saturday in the Situation Room, he claimed to have watched the raid from an \u201cabsolutely perfect\u201d view of the skirmish and appeared to relish the details. \u201cThey blasted their way in so quickly, it was incredible,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWhen he blew himself up, the tunnel collapsed on top of him, on top of everything \u2014 and his children. I mean, so he led his three children to death,\u201d he said of Mr. al-Baghdadi. Mr. Trump added that the body of the ISIS leader \u201cwas mutilated by the blast.\u201d A photograph released  by the White House showed Mr. Trump in the Situation Room on Saturday, surrounded by his top aides, monitoring developments. The photo, showing six stone-faced men staring into the camera, appeared to be Mr. Trump\u2019s answer to the photograph of Mr. Obama and his team receiving live updates about the operation to kill Bin Laden. But Mr. Trump\u2019s breathless language stood in contrast to the stark version of events that Mr. Obama relayed to the public after the secret raid that killed Bin Laden. \u201cA small team of Americans carried out the operation with extraordinary courage and capability,\u201d Mr. Obama said, addressing the nation in 2011. \u201cNo Americans were harmed. They took care to avoid civilian casualties. After a firefight, they killed Osama bin Laden and took custody of his body.\u201d After reading his statement, Mr. Obama turned around and left the podium, taking no questions. Mr. Trump ended his news conference after defending his decision to pull American troops out of Syria and criticizing President George W. Bush\u2019s decision to send troops to Iraq. \u201cHe was a gutless animal,\u201d Mr. Trump said in closing of Mr. al-Baghdadi. \u201cThank you all very much. I appreciate it. Very great day for our country.\u201d During the afternoon, the president called the families of four Americans who were kidnapped by the Islamic State. Three of them, including journalist James Foley, were beheaded in gruesome propaganda videos. A fourth, Kayla Mueller, was killed under murky circumstances. Then, Sunday night, Mr. Trump made his only public appearance of the day, arriving at Game 5 of the World Series at Nationals Park three miles from the White House. Mr. Trump sat in a box with a group of Republican lawmakers he invited along, including his Saturday golf partners Mr. Graham and Mr. Perdue, as well as Melania Trump, the first lady. But the cocoon of support could not insulate him from the \u201cLock him up!\u201d chants and boos that swept through the stadium when his presence was announced.",

Eight years later, President Trump watched a raid unfold against Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.By Annie KarniPRINT EDITIONIn a Moment of High Stakes, Two Presidents, Two Approaches|October 30, 2019, Page A11",
      "author": "Annie Karni",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Two images, one filled with tension and action, one static and posed, depict the country\u2019s commanders in chief at significant, and parallel, moments in their presidencies \u2014 overseeing missions to capture and kill terrorists long sought by the United States. Taken by official White House photographers, the photographs also underscore the drastically different styles of the presidents who oversaw the missions. In the first photograph, President Barack Obama is sitting in the back of the Situation Room, dressed down in a windbreaker and polo shirt. He had just arrived back at the White House on the afternoon of May 1, 2011, after playing golf at Joint Base Andrews to avoid any questions about why he had changed his typical Sunday routine, according to former aides. Mr. Obama had not changed out of his golf clothes when he entered a Situation Room conference room at around 3:30 p.m. to watch Navy SEALs raid the compound of Osama bin Laden \u2014 the terrorist behind the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001 \u2014 in Abbottabad, Pakistan. In the second photograph, President Trump is dressed in a tailored suit and baby blue tie, staring directly at the camera from his seat at the middle of the table in the Situation Room. The official seal of the President of the United States is positioned almost perfectly above his head. Mr. Trump had also just returned to the White House from a golf game on the afternoon of Oct. 26. But a president who puts a high value on looking the part made sure he was dressed for entering the \u201cSit Room\u201d to monitor Special Operations commandos closing in on Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the former leader of ISIS, in Syria. The aides around the table in both photographs appear to take their cues from the man at the top. Those around Mr. Trump, all men, are dressed in suits and ties or military uniforms. Most of Mr. Obama\u2019s staffers are missing jackets or ties. Mr. Obama did not take a seat at the table as he watched a live feed of the raid from a crewless drone overhead. Instead, he was seated off to the side, next to Brig. Gen. Marshall B. Webb, assistant commanding general of Joint Special Operations Command, who was overseeing the communications for the operation. Also seated around the table: Vice President Joseph R. Biden, Jr., without a tie; Denis McDonough, who was deputy national security adviser at the time, and also tieless; Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, with a hand covering her mouth in a gesture of apparent awe at what she was witnessing (at the time she said she was covering her mouth to cough, but later said it was a gasp); and Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates, with a tie but no jacket. Seven other national security officials, including Tom Donilon, the national security adviser (sans tie), filled the space behind the chairs to standing-room-only capacity. The tension in the photograph is the scene of the nation\u2019s top national security officials so absorbed in action taking place halfway across the globe that no one in the room seems aware of the presence of a photographer documenting the moment, or where they were positioned in relation to the president. Mr. Trump, in contrast, is seated at the head of the table in the Situation Room\u2019s main conference room, positioned at the center of the action with a smaller circle of aides fanning out around him. On one side of Mr. Trump is Vice President Mike Pence. On the other is Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper. The other officials are: Robert C. O\u2019Brien, the national security adviser; Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; and Brig. Gen. Marcus Evans, deputy director for special operations on the Joint Staff, whose face is obscured. Mr. Obama\u2019s understated position in the photograph makes him look like a White House staffer, not the man who ordered the raid the night before. Mr. Trump looks like a chief executive posing for a photograph in which his role is central to the story itself. Mr. Trump and Mr. Obama are pictured in different conference rooms that are both considered part of the Situation Room. Mr. Trump is seen in the Situation Room\u2019s main conference room, where the president typically works. But during the raid that successfully killed Bin Laden, Obama officials initially set up the communications link in a smaller conference room across the hall from the main room. \u201cThey didn\u2019t yet know at that moment when the image was made that they had gotten Bin Laden,\u201d recalled Pete Souza, the former Obama White House staff photographer, who captured the now-iconic photograph at 4:05 p.m. It is not clear exactly when the photograph of Mr. Trump was taken. Captured by the White House photographer Shealah Craighead, the picture was not time-stamped. Metadata from the image indicates it was created at 5:06 p.m., and the White House said Mr. Trump was seen \u201cmonitoring developments as U.S. Special Operations forces close in\u201d on Mr. al-Baghdadi. The Obama White House released nine different candid images of the president and his top aides working as the Bin Laden raid unfolded, one even capturing an emotional Mr. Obama. Mr. Trump does not allow his staff photographer free range to capture behind-the-scenes photographs of life and work in the White House. Instead, he most often invites Ms. Craighead, or other White House photographers, into the room specifically for the purpose of taking an official picture. The Trump White House released two almost identical photographs of Mr. Trump working in the Situation Room on Saturday. The photographs are taken from the same angle, but one is cropped tighter than the other.",

      "author": "Emily S. Rueb",
      "content": "  Former President Barack Obama made a rare foray into the cultural conversation this week, objecting to the prevalence of \u201ccall-out culture\u201d and \u201cwokeness\u201d during an interview about youth activism at the Obama Foundation summit on Tuesday. For more than an hour, Mr. Obama sat onstage with the actress Yara Shahidi and several other young leaders from around the world. The conversation touched on \u201cleadership, grass roots change and the power places have to shape our journeys,\u201d the Obama Foundation said, but it was his remarks about young activists that have ricocheted around the internet, mostly receiving praise from a cohort of bipartisan and intergenerational supporters. \u201cThis idea of purity and you\u2019re never compromised and you\u2019re always politically \u2018woke\u2019 and all that stuff,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cYou should get over that quickly.\u201d \u201cThe world is messy; there are ambiguities,\u201d he continued. \u201cPeople who do really good stuff have flaws. People who you are fighting may love their kids, and share certain things with you.\u201d Mr. Obama spoke repeatedly of the role of social media in activism specifically, including the idea of what\u2019s become known as \u201ccancel culture,\u201d which is much remarked upon, but still nebulously defined. It tends to refer to behavior that mostly plays out on the internet when someone has said or done something to which others object. That person is then condemned in a flurry of social media posts. Such people are often referred to as \u201ccanceled,\u201d a way of saying that many others (and perhaps the places at which they work) are fed up with them and will have no more to do with them. [What\u2019s cancel culture really like? Ask a teenager. They know.] Mr. Obama talked about conversations he\u2019s had with his daughter Malia, who is a student at Harvard with Ms. Shahidi. \u201cI do get a sense sometimes now among certain young people, and this is accelerated by social media, there is this sense sometimes of: \u2018The way of me making change is to be as judgmental as possible about other people,\u2019\u201d he said, \u201cand that\u2019s enough.\u201d \u201cLike, if I tweet or hashtag about how you didn\u2019t do something right or used the wrong verb,\u201d he said, \u201cthen I can sit back and feel pretty good about myself, cause, \u2018Man, you see how woke I was, I called you out.\u2019\u201d Then he pretended to sit back and press the remote to turn on a television. \u201cThat\u2019s not activism. That\u2019s not bringing about change,\u201d he said. \u201cIf all you\u2019re doing is casting stones, you\u2019re probably not going to get that far. That\u2019s easy to do.\u201d The audience erupted in applause, which was echoed by conservative pundits like Ann Coulter. \u201cGood for Obama,\u201d Ms. Coulter tweeted on Wednesday night, adding a parenthetical: \u201cNot sarcastic!\u201d Tomi Lahren, a conservative political commentator, said on \u201cFox & Friends\u201d on Wednesday that Mr. Obama\u2019s comments made him look like \u201cthe voice of reason\u201d and that \u201cthat\u2019s when you know the Democratic Party has gotten this bad.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s really nice to hear is Barack Obama standing up for our rights and our values of the First Amendment,\u201d Ms. Lahren said. \u201cJust remember that we used to think Barack Obama was bad.\u201d Tulsi Gabbard, a Democratic presidential candidate and a congresswoman from Mr. Obama\u2019s home state of Hawaii, seized on his words as a campaign message for her supporters. \u201cIn a nutshell, Obama is saying we all need a little more aloha spirit,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cBeing respectful & caring for one another. Not being so quick to judge. Not seeing everything as black/white. I hope you\u2019ll join me in bringing the spirit of aloha to the White House.\u201d Another Democratic presidential candidate, Andrew Yang, also championed the message on Twitter. \u201cHe is right on all counts,\u201d Mr. Yang said. Others called out the 44th president for being \u201cpaternalistic.\u201d Michael Arceneaux, the author of \u201cI Can\u2019t Date Jesus: Love, Sex, Family, Race, and Other Reasons I\u2019ve Put My Faith in Beyonc\u00e9,\u201d said he didn\u2019t \u201cneed lessons about \u2018being woke\u2019 and \u2018cancel culture\u2019\u201d in an op-ed for The Independent. \u201cI am never quite sure if Obama really thinks this na\u00efvely or if he\u2019s trying to convince certain sects of the population \u2014 notably young black folks, whom he just loves to lecture \u2014 that it\u2019s better to coddle white people about their prejudices with the hopes of growth rather than speak our minds as we see fit,\u201d he said. Since leaving office in January 2017, the former president has mostly remained out of the public fray. Most of his appearances have focused on discussing the integrity of the political system and similar themes. Following tradition, Mr. Obama initially refrained from publicly criticizing his successor. But during the run-up to the 2018 midterms, he called President Donald J. Trump  a threat to American values while speaking to students at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He has occasionally returned to the campaign trail to rally black voters and, more recently, has been working behind the scenes to advise Democratic presidential hopefuls. But he has yet to make an endorsement.",

      "content": " This article was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting. GUANT\u00c1NAMO BAY, Cuba \u2014 The United States government on Thursday offered a $4 million reward for information on the whereabouts of a Sudanese man who was convicted of war crimes at Guant\u00e1namo, was repatriated in 2012 and is suspected of recruiting for Al Qaeda\u2019s branch in Yemen. It is believed to be the first case of the United States offering a reward for the whereabouts of a prisoner released from Guant\u00e1namo by the Obama administration. In 2014, the United States similarly offered a reward for a Saudi man who had been held at Guant\u00e1namo but never charged and was released by the Bush administration in 2006. He was killed in a drone strike in 2015. The State Department declined on Thursday to say whether any money was paid. The announcement by the State Department of the new bounty on Thursday offered up to $4 million for information on the location of the Sudanese man, Ibrahim al-Qosi, 59. He pleaded guilty at Guant\u00e1namo in 2010 to providing support for terrorism and Al Qaeda in exchange for his repatriation. The reward announcement described Mr. al-Qosi as a member of the leadership team of the Yemen-based Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Mr. al-Qosi, an accountant, kept the books for a business owned by the Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden in Khartoum in the early 1990s before Sudan expelled Bin Laden. Mr. al-Qosi then followed him to Afghanistan in 1996 where, the prisoner said in his guilty plea, he performed menial tasks at a Qaeda compound, including running its kitchen and sometimes serving as a driver. Mr. al-Qosi also said he fired a mortar for a militia helping the Taliban fight the Northern Alliance but said he was not involved with and did not know in advance about the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. He was captured in Pakistan in 2001 and was among the first detainees brought to Guant\u00e1namo, as a suspected Bin Laden bodyguard. Three years after his repatriation, Mr. al-Qosi began appearing in videos and other publications of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and, according to the State Department, \u201chas encouraged lone-wolf attacks against the United States in online propaganda.\u201d Guant\u00e1namo today has 40 prisoners, including nine who have been convicted or face charges in the military commissions. The Bush administration released about 540 of the approximately 780 detainees it brought to Guant\u00e1namo starting in January 2002. The Obama administration transferred about 200 more. A report to Congress by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which was released in June, said that this year the United States intelligence community had identified 67 living and at-large former Guant\u00e1namo prisoners who after being sent elsewhere engaged in terrorist or insurgent activities. Seven of them were released by the Obama administration. The report said the intelligence community had identified another 78 at-large former Guant\u00e1namo prisoners who were suspected of engaging in terrorist or insurgent activities.",

      "content": "  When Russia invaded Ukraine in early 2014, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. pressed President Barack Obama to take decisive action, and fast, to make Moscow \u201cpay in blood and money\u201d for its aggression. The president, a Biden aide recalled, was having none of it. Mr. Biden worked Mr. Obama during their weekly private lunches, imploring him to increase lethal aid, backing a push to ship FGM-148 Javelin anti-tank missiles to Kiev. The president flatly rejected the idea and dispatched him to the region as an emissary, cautioning him \u201cabout not overpromising to the Ukrainian government,\u201d Mr. Biden would later write in a memoir. [Trump, Ukraine and impeachment: The inside story of how we got here.] So, Mr. Biden threw himself into what seemed like standard-issue vice-presidential stuff: prodding Ukraine\u2019s leaders to tackle the rampant corruption that made their country a risky bet for international lenders \u2014 and pushing reform of Ukraine\u2019s cronyism-ridden energy industry. \u201cYou have to be whiter than snow, or the whole world will abandon you,\u201d Mr. Biden told the country\u2019s newly elected president, Petro O. Poroshenko, during an early 2014 phone call, according to former administration officials. That message was delivered just as Mr. Biden\u2019s son Hunter joined the board of a Ukrainian gas company that was the subject of multiple corruption investigations, a position that paid him as much as $50,000 a month and \u2014 in the view of some administration officials, including the ambassador to Kiev \u2014 threatened to undermine Mr. Biden\u2019s agenda. Thanks to President Trump and his lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani, that subplot has now swallowed the story line. Their efforts to press Ukrainian officials to investigate unsubstantiated charges against the Bidens have propelled Mr. Trump to the brink of impeachment. They have also put Mr. Biden on the defensive at a critical moment in the Democratic presidential primary campaign. As the impeachment hearings go public this week, the Republicans are hoping to redirect the spotlight onto the Bidens. A look at what the former vice president actually did in Ukraine (he visited six times and spent hours on the phone with the country\u2019s leaders) tells a different story, according to interviews with more than two dozen people knowledgeable about the situation. It casts light on one of Mr. Biden\u2019s central arguments for himself in the primary: his eight years of diplomacy as Mr. Obama\u2019s No. 2. Mr. Biden dived into Ukraine in hopes of burnishing his statesman credentials at a time when he seemed to be winding down his political career, as his elder son, Beau, was dying and his younger one, Hunter, was struggling with addiction and financial problems. It turned out to be an unforgiving landscape \u2014 threatened by Russia, plundered by oligarchs, plagued by indecisive leaders and overrun by outsiders hoping to make a quick buck off the chaos. Writing in his 2017 memoir, Mr. Biden said Ukraine gave him a chance to fulfill a childhood promise to make a difference in the world. It also came to serve a political purpose, as \u201ca legacy project, something he could run on,\u201d said Keith Darden, an associate professor at American University who studies Ukraine policy. In the end, it was an unglamorous holding action, but one that suited Mr. Biden\u2019s Mr. Fix-It approach to the vice presidency \u2014 and his view of Ukraine as the front line in a larger battle to contain the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin. \u201cPeople forget it now, but at that time period, 2014 and 2015, it wasn\u2019t clear Ukraine would survive,\u201d Mr. Darden said. \u201cThey were teetering on the brink of bankruptcy. They had only 8,000 battle-ready troops.\u201d A key to Mr. Biden\u2019s relevance as vice president was his willingness to take jobs nobody else wanted. In early 2014, as others on Mr. Obama\u2019s team raced to finish big-splash deals with Cuba and Iran, Mr. Biden told the president he wanted to take on three of the most unappetizing foreign-policy tasks left undone: containing the Islamic State, curbing immigration from Central America and keeping Russia from devouring Ukraine. Mr. Biden had deep contacts in Europe, and as a senator in the 1990s had had some success persuading President Bill Clinton to take action in the Balkans. He considered himself to be among the few people in Mr. Obama\u2019s orbit who understood Europe and were willing to challenge Mr. Putin \u2014 a counter to the national security adviser, Susan E. Rice, who repeatedly warned the president against escalating a conflict with Russia that the United States could not win. Yet on Ukraine, as elsewhere, Mr. Biden was less an architect of policy than the empowered executor of Mr. Obama\u2019s policy. \u201cHe was the vice president, not the president,\u201d said Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire, part of a bipartisan group of lawmakers allied with Mr. Biden who pressured Mr. Obama to help Ukraine\u2019s military. Indeed, the drive to provide lethal aid to Kiev was a group effort, pushed by senators and two powerful State Department officials: Geoffrey R. Pyatt, who was the ambassador in Kiev, and Victoria J. Nuland, then the hawkish assistant secretary for European and Eurasian affairs. Ms. Nuland was overheard telling Mr. Pyatt they needed Mr. Biden \u201cfor an attaboy\u201d to encourage Ukrainian leaders to fulfill their promises, during a 2013 phone conversation about Ukraine, bugged and released to the media. Mr. Biden applied his Amtrak charm to local players like Ukraine\u2019s embattled president, Viktor Yanukovych, with limited effect. Former White House aides recall watching an agitated Mr. Biden ducking in and out of a secure phone booth outside the situation room in early 2014, trying to reach Mr. Yanukovych on his cellphone. \u201cWhere the hell is this guy?\u201d he kept asking, before learning that Mr. Yanukovych had fled Kiev, ultimately for Russia, as huge street protests erupted against his regime\u2019s corruption and his pivot away from Europe and toward Moscow. Mr. Putin then rushed in, annexing Crimea and backing paramilitaries who invaded the country\u2019s east. While Mr. Biden\u2019s pitch for missiles was rebuffed, he eventually helped sell Mr. Obama on sending about 100 American service members to train Ukraine\u2019s security forces. Things seemed to be looking up in May 2014 with the election of Mr. Poroshenko, an oligarch who billed himself as a reformer. At first, the vice president\u2019s hard-edged messages to him on corruption were coated with kibbitz \u2014 demands accompanied by Bidenesque inquiries like whether the puffy-eyed president was getting enough sleep, aides recalled. Within months, though, the State Department began suspecting that the office of Mr. Poroshenko\u2019s first prosecutor general was accepting bribes to protect Mykola Zlochevsky, the oligarch owner of Burisma Holdings, the gas company where Hunter Biden was a board member. In a February 2015 meeting in Kiev with a deputy prosecutor, a State Department official named George P. Kent demanded to know \u201cwho took the bribe and how much was it?\u201d The prosecutor general was fired soon after. But it wasn\u2019t long before the new prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, was drawing allegations of corruption, including from State Department officials who suspected he was shaking down targets and intentionally slow-walking investigations to protect allies. Mr. Giuliani has claimed, without evidence, that Mr. Biden\u2019s push to oust Mr. Shokin was an attempt to block scrutiny of his son\u2019s actions. In fact, Mr. Biden was just one of many officials calling for Mr. Shokin to go. Good-government activists were protesting his actions in the streets, as were eurozone power players like Christine Lagarde, then the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, along with Ms. Nuland and Senate Republicans. \u201cThe position regarding getting rid of Shokin was not Vice President Biden\u2019s position; it was the position of the U.S. government, as well as the European Union and international financial institutions,\u201d said Amos J. Hochstein, former coordinator for international energy affairs at the State Department and one of the few administration officials who directly confronted Mr. Biden at the time about his son. Ukraine\u2019s energy industry, the country\u2019s geopolitically crucial economic engine, was a central point of contention between the Obama administration and Kiev. Mr. Biden and Mr. Hochstein, echoing a similar effort by European officials, pressured Mr. Poroshenko to reform the operations of the state-owned natural gas company Naftogaz, which controlled about two-thirds of the country\u2019s energy resources. (Burisma, a smaller, privately owned company, played no role in Mr. Biden\u2019s pressure campaign, and administration officials could not recall whether the company was even mentioned in meetings the vice president attended on energy matters.) By late 2015, American officials had grown so frustrated with Mr. Poroshenko\u2019s sluggish response on all fronts that Mr. Biden was dispatched to make the case publicly for reforms to the Ukrainian Parliament. That December, in a speech that he later described as one of the most important he had ever delivered, the vice president told legislators they had \u201cto remove all conflicts between their business interest and their government responsibilities.\u201d He also singled out the natural gas industry, saying, \u201cThe energy sector needs to be competitive, ruled by market principles \u2014 not sweetheart deals.\u201d His words, like his work in Ukraine over all, were important but hardly decisive. \u201cA lot of good things would not have happened if Biden hadn\u2019t been focused on Ukraine, but his work did not fundamentally change the overall institutional corruption,\u201d said Edward C. Chow, an expert on geopolitics and energy policy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a nonpartisan Washington think tank. \u201cAnd having his son doing what he did was a distraction that undermined his message.\u201d Mr. Shokin was eventually fired, but only months later, after I.M.F. officials threatened to withdraw funding. In the intervening years, there has been much churn and less change. Mr. Putin, facing sanctions, has mostly stayed in check. Mr. Poroshenko was beaten at the polls by Volodymyr Zelensky in April, and remains bitter toward Mr. Biden for calling him out over his handling of Naftogaz during a meeting shortly before the 2016 elections, according to a person to whom he recently complained. Some reforms have been put in place at the energy giant: Ukrainian officials agreed to appoint an international oversight board (Mr. Hochstein is now a paid I.M.F. appointee to the panel), but the issue of sweetheart deals remains unresolved. The battle over Naftogaz has also become wrapped up in the House impeachment inquiry. Two of Mr. Giuliani\u2019s associates in his pressure campaign against the Bidens \u2014 Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman \u2014 were part of an effort to remove Mr. Pyatt\u2019s successor as ambassador to Kiev, Marie L. Yovanovitch, who had called for reforms to the energy giant. For his part, Hunter Biden remained on Burisma\u2019s board until his term expired in April. It was Mr. Trump, ironically, who signed off on Mr. Biden\u2019s request to send the Javelins. Mr. Biden wants to move on. \u201cI carried out the policy of the United States government,\u201d he said during the most recent Democratic debate. \u201cThat\u2019s what we should be focusing on.\u201d But he did not take advantage of a chance to eliminate the distraction four years ago, when the threat resurfaced \u2014 in the form of questions from The New York Times and follow-ups from other news organizations \u2014 as he flew to Kiev on Air Force Two to deliver the anti-corruption speech to Parliament. Several aides recalled a surreal split-screen of activity onboard, as Mr. Biden\u2019s team focused mostly on the speech (he urged them to make it tougher), but peeled off for intermittent huddles on how to handle the Hunter story (Mr. Biden dismissed the story as a distraction, and did not engage). The group defaulted to the pushback plan used the year before when the story had first emerged, issuing a statement that Hunter Biden was \u201ca private citizen and a lawyer.\u201d They emphasized \u201cprivate citizen,\u201d many former aides said, because the vice president would not even discuss taking the step that could make all questions vanish: asking his son to quit the Burisma board, as editorial boards and Ukraine experts were suggesting. Mr. Biden\u2019s advisers say that he and his son had informally agreed years earlier not to discuss anything pertaining to the younger Mr. Biden\u2019s business activities, as a way to insulate them both. Bob Bauer, former Obama White House counsel and Biden adviser, said that even pressuring Hunter Biden to quit the board would have constituted a breach of that firewall, and suggested that was one of the reasons the vice president chose not to do it. \u201cThe independent activities of an adult child simply don\u2019t create a \u2018conflict of interest\u2019 for the parent who is a public official,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd as a matter of sound ethical practice, it is important for officials in this position to maintain that distance: to be able to show that, in doing their jobs, they could not have been affected by discussions or involvement with their adult children relating to private business matters. Their posture has to be, \u2018Whatever you decide to do, I am going to do what I have to do.\u2019\u201d Mr. Biden has said he first learned of his son\u2019s activities in Ukraine when the story broke in 2014. He told his son, \u201cI hope you know what you are doing,\u201d according to Hunter Biden\u2019s account of their discussion in The New Yorker earlier this year. If that settled matters between father and son, Hunter Biden\u2019s activities struck many of the officials working on Ukraine policy as an unnecessary distraction, or worse. Mr. Biden\u2019s own aides were so worried about the optics, they enlisted State Department officials to gather facts to determine how to handle the story, according to people who worked with his office. Yet few, if any, had raised the issue with Mr. Biden directly when it first arose. Most viewed the revelation \u2014 unseemly, but not illegal or a violation of ethics rules \u2014 as simply not worth risking a scolding from Mr. Biden, who had reacted angrily when Mr. Obama\u2019s aides raised the issue of his son\u2019s lobbying during the 2008 campaign. One person who briefly discussed the matter with Mr. Biden said he was anguished by his son\u2019s personal problems and unsure how to help him recover. Mr. Hochstein, reflecting the concerns of State Department officials, including Mr. Pyatt, tried to get several of Mr. Biden\u2019s aides to broach the subject with him in 2014. When they declined, he took matters into his own hands, according to three Obama administration officials with knowledge of the situation. It is not clear how Mr. Biden responded; Mr. Hochstein did not disclose details of their interaction. But former administration officials involved in the response to the story, speaking on the condition of anonymity, cited one reason above all others for backing off: the vice president\u2019s shaky emotional state over Beau\u2019s illness and death. Mr. Kent, now the deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, told House investigators that his concerns had not been addressed by a White House official, who told him that Mr. Biden lacked the \u201cfurther bandwidth to deal with family-related issues at that time.\u201d Mr. Biden\u2019s mood in 2019 is no longer grief but anger. His aides accuse the news media of abetting Mr. Trump by aiming the story, now the catalyst for impeachment, back at the former vice president. \u201cLet\u2019s not forget that this was covered on A22 of The Times in 2015, because it did not fall outside the White House\u2019s ethical guidelines and was simply not a major story,\u201d said Kate Bedingfield, the Biden campaign\u2019s communications director. She added: \u201cWhat\u2019s different now? It\u2019s that Donald Trump is aggressively lying about it every day in the hopes that it winds up on the front page.\u201d",

      "author": "Lisa Lerer",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Former President Barack Obama offered an unusual warning to the Democratic primary field on Friday evening, cautioning the candidates not to move too far to the left in their policy proposals, even as he sought to reassure a party establishment worried about the electoral strength of their historically large primary field. Speaking before a room of wealthy liberal donors, Mr. Obama urged Democrats to remember the long, combative slog of his primary campaign against Hillary Clinton in 2008, arguing that the 16 month battle ultimately made him a stronger general election candidate. \u201cFor those who get stressed about robust primaries, I just have to remind you I had a very robust primary,\u201d he told the group of several hundred donors and organizational leaders in Washington. \u201cI\u2019m confident that at the end of the process we will have a candidate that has been tested.\u201d Yet, he also raised concerns about some of the liberal ideas being promoted by some candidates, citing health care and immigration as issues where the proposals may have gone further than public opinion. While Mr. Obama did not single out any specific primary candidate or policy proposal, he cautioned that the universe of voters that could support a Democratic candidate \u2014 Democrats, independents and moderate Republicans \u2014 are not driven by the same views reflected on \u201ccertain left-leaning Twitter feeds\u201d or \u201cthe activist wing of our party.\u201d \u201cEven as we push the envelope and we are bold in our vision we also have to be rooted in reality,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cThe average American doesn\u2019t think we have to completely tear down the system and remake it.\u201d The comments marked an extraordinary entrance into the primary contest by the former president, who has been careful to avoid even the appearance of influencing the direction of the race. His remarks offered an implicit critique of Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, who have urged voters to embrace \u201cpolitical revolution\u201d and \u201cbig, structural change,\u201d as well as proposals once widely considered to be left to the liberal fringes of the party, including court packing and decriminalizing illegal border crossings. Even as Mr. Obama has attempted to stay out of the race, the primary candidates have engaged in a heated discussion over his legacy, debating whether to stick with Mr. Obama\u2019s architecture for health care policy or to pursue a single-payer system and offering flashes of direct criticism over his record on immigration. At the same time, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has made his strong support for Mr. Obama and his accomplishments a hallmark of his candidacy. Acknowledging that candidates must \u201cpush past\u201d his achievements, Mr. Obama urged his party\u2019s candidates not to push too far, as he urged them to adopt a message that would allow them to compete in all corners of the country. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should be deluded into thinking that the resistance to certain approaches to things is simply because voters haven\u2019t heard a bold enough proposal and if they hear something as bold as possible then immediately that\u2019s going to activate them,\u201d he said. The fact that Mr. Obama offered his reassurances at the annual meeting of the Democracy Alliance, a club of wealthy liberals who donate hundreds of thousands of dollars a year to recommended political organizations, only underscored the intended audience of his message. In recent weeks, establishment-aligned Democrats, top donors and some strategists have expressed fears that the party lacks a strong enough candidate to defeat President Trump. They question whether Mr. Biden has the ability to compete in a multistate primary campaign, fret about Mr. Sanders\u2019s and Ms. Warren\u2019s viability in the general election and remain skeptical that Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., can broaden his appeal beyond white voters. Their concerns have prompted the late emergence of two experienced candidates, Deval Patrick, the former governor of Massachusetts and a close friend of Mr. Obama, and Michael R. Bloomberg, both of whom entered the field after nine candidates had already dropped out. Those worries are not necessarily shared by voters in early states, where surveys show that most Democrats have gravitated to a short list of four candidates and feel the field remains too large. \u201cIf you talk to the voters they don\u2019t feel the need for another candidate,\u201d said Kathy Sullivan, the former chairwoman of the Democratic Party in New Hampshire. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been sitting around in New Hampshire saying we need a hero to come and rescue us.\u201d Since leaving office nearly three years ago, the former president has mostly remained out of the public fray. While he\u2019s headlined fund-raising events for Democratic committees, the former president has kept a low profile in the presidential race, meeting privately with most of the Democratic candidates but telling friends and political allies that neither he nor his wife, Michelle, have plans to endorse anyone and do not see it as their place to steer the party\u2019s future. Mr. Obama has expressed interest, at different times, in rising stars like former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas and Mr. Buttigieg. Mr. Obama had issued a warm statement about Mr. Biden\u2019s entry into the primary but had declined to endorse him or anyone else. During his nearly hourlong remarks on Friday, Mr. Obama offered only one clear endorsement, though not exactly the one many Democratic donors in the room wanted to hear. Mr. Obama was interviewed by Stacey Abrams, who drew national attention during her unsuccessful run for governor of Georgia last year and is widely considered to be on the shortlist for the vice presidency \u2014 no matter which candidate ultimately wins the nomination. \u201cI love me some Stacey Abrams,\u201d he said.",

      "content": "  LONG BEACH, Calif. \u2014 The crowded Democratic field of presidential candidates grappled with President Barack Obama\u2019s advice and legacy on Saturday, the day after the former president sounded an unusual public warning about moving too far left in the primary race. While none were willing to directly rebuff Mr. Obama, a few candidates offered implicit criticism, saying that Democrats should be careful to steadfastly back the field so that whoever wins the nomination can count on enthusiastic support from all corners of the party. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing right now, creating these dynamics within the Democratic Party, we\u2019ve got to be careful,\u201d Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey said, his voice rising as he addressed reporters in Long Beach, Calif., after speaking at the state\u2019s Democratic Convention. \u201cBecause whoever is the nominee, we have one shot to make Donald Trump a one-term president. And so I\u2019m not interested in delineating left or right or criticizing other folks.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s stop tearing each other down, let\u2019s stop drawing artificial lines,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m tired in this election of hearing some people say, \u2018Well if this person gets elected, I can\u2019t support them,\u2019 and then other people say, \u2018If this person gets elected, I can\u2019t support them.\u2019 Are you kidding me?\u201d During a televised forum sponsored by Univision, Jorge Ramos, an anchor for the Spanish-language station, asked Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont if Mr. Obama was right in saying that \u201cthe average American doesn\u2019t think we have to completely tear down the system.\u201d Mr. Sanders chuckled briefly and responded, \u201cWell, it depends on what you mean by tear down the system.\u201d \u201cThe agenda that we have is an agenda supported by the vast majority of working people,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I talk about raising the minimum wage to a living wage, I\u2019m not tearing down the system. We\u2019re fighting for justice. When I talk about health care being a human right and ending the embarrassment of America being the only major country on earth that does not guarantee health care for every man, woman and child, that\u2019s not tearing down the system. That\u2019s doing what we should have done 30 years ago.\u201d Juli\u00e1n Castro, who served as the housing secretary under Mr. Obama and has embraced some of the most left-leaning policies during the primary, said that he \u201calways takes what President Obama says very very seriously.\u201d But, he emphatically said that he believed any of the candidates would be well-positioned to defeat President Trump. \u201cI don\u2019t think that anybody in this campaign has articulated a vision for the future of the country that would not command a majority of voters in November of 2020,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir vision for the future of the country is much better and will be more popular than Donald Trump\u2019s.\u201d The comments came just a day after Mr. Obama spoke at a forum in Washington, D.C., and warned against Democrats moving too far to the left, particularly on issues such as health care and immigration. While Mr. Obama did not mention any candidate by name, he took aim at the \u201cactivist wing\u201d of the Democratic Party and \u201cleft-leaning Twitter feeds,\u201d saying they were out of touch with the average voter. \u201cThis is still a country that is less revolutionary than it is interested in improvement,\u201d he told an audience of some of the party\u2019s wealthiest donors on Friday evening. The remarks were a rare departure for Mr. Obama. While the former president has spoken privately with nearly all the candidates, he has been careful to avoid exerting any influence on the race. Aides said his comments were intended to calm the nerves of Democrats who were worried about the strength of their historically large field, but Mr. Obama ended up reinforcing some of their more pressing concerns. Some establishment Democrats, elected officials and top donors have fretted that the liberal platforms of Mr. Sanders and Senator Elizabeth Warren would complicate their paths to the general election, arguing that they would lose voters in rural areas and in the suburban districts that helped the party win back the House last year. They are particularly worried about the politics of \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d fearing it could transform health care, an issue that has been a political asset for Democrats, into a liability. \u201cWe\u2019re changing something that clearly is a message that, in 2018, resonated with voters and we\u2019re making the issue about our plan rather than what the president has or has not done,\u201d former Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota said. Among the liberal wing of the party, Mr. Obama\u2019s remarks prompted fierce backlash online and the creation of the hashtag #TooFarLeft by Peter Daou, a former adviser to Hillary Clinton. Ms. Warren declined to address Mr. Obama\u2019s implicit criticism, and instead praised the former president\u2019s efforts on health care. \u201cI so admire what President Obama did. He is the one who led the way on health care and got health care coverage for tens of millions of Americans when nobody thought that was possible,\u201d she said, speaking to reporters after a campaign event in Waverly, Iowa. \u201cThose are huge changes in this country and they have made a difference for millions of people, and I will always be grateful,\u201d she said. Former Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts did not address Mr. Obama\u2019s comments directly, but argued that he defied ideological labels. \u201cDon\u2019t put me in a box,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cI don\u2019t fit. By the way, neither do most voters.\u201d \u201cOne of the most exciting things about this moment is that the public\u2019s appetite for solutions as big as the challenges we face is greater than it\u2019s been in a long, long while,\u201d he said. \u201cOur goals should be ambitious.\u201d Mr. Patrick received a tepid response to his five-minute speech at the California Democratic Convention in Long Beach, Calif., on Saturday, his first major address since declaring his bid for the presidency. \u201cI am not running, my friends, to be president of the Democrats. I am running to be President of the United States.\u201d But he quickly added: \u201cI\u2019m not talking about a moderate agenda. This is no time for a moderate agenda. I\u2019m talking about being woke, while leaving room for the still waking.\u201d Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota was among those objecting to Mr. Obama\u2019s premise. She published a tweet listing some of the priorities of the progressive left, with the rejoinder, \u201cCount me in!\u201d",

      "author": "Glenn Thrush",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Barack Obama had a plan of sorts for the 2020 presidential primaries, according to several allies and advisers: Stay out of the way, offer advice when asked, promote voting rights, finish a new memoir \u2014 then jump back into politics after Democrats picked their nominee. Things haven\u2019t worked out like that. After three years of largely steering clear of divisive internal Democratic fights, Mr. Obama is increasingly moving off the political sidelines and trying to play a new role: elder statesman for a party grappling with its post-Obama identity. Associates describe a former president impelled by his belief that the diverse electorate he once unified is being split by \u201cMedicare for all\u201d and immigration proposals \u2014 ideas that he thinks could alienate moderate voters in the 2020 election. From appearances before party donors to conversations with activists and lawmakers, Mr. Obama is going public with a message for his fellow Democrats he had previously made in private to allies and a handful of friendly journalists: Focus on defeating President Trump, ditch the ideological purity and the \u201ccancel\u201d culture, or face the abyss. He is expected to amplify these concerns about the 2020 race on Thursday at an event with party donors in San Francisco, an aide said, giving him a fresh chance to reflect on Wednesday night\u2019s Democratic debate in Atlanta. (Several of those interviewed for this article spoke on condition of anonymity to describe his private views.) \u201cWhat\u2019s happening is he\u2019s seeing the campaign move to a different stage, and he\u2019s reacting to it,\u201d said David Axelrod, a longtime Obama adviser. \u201cHe sees himself as a ref, not a player. What he\u2019s saying is, \u2018Hey, let\u2019s not put so much passion into the intramurals that we forget to show up for the actual game.\u2019\u201d Mr. Obama made that point in the bluntest possible terms last week to an audience of Democratic donors who had expected him to offer reassurances about the strength of the Democratic field and the durability of the party\u2019s leading moderate, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. After praising the field and suggesting any of them could defeat Mr. Trump, he issued a warning that appeared aimed at Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, the two leading liberals in the 2020 race, who have proposed far-reaching changes to the American economy and health care and education systems. \u201cThe average American doesn\u2019t think that we have to completely tear down the system and remake it,\u201d said Mr. Obama, appearing onstage at the annual meeting of the progressive Democracy Alliance in Washington with Stacey Abrams, the former Georgia candidate for governor. \u201cThere are a lot of persuadable voters and there are a lot of Democrats out there who they just want to see things make sense. They just don\u2019t want to see crazy stuff.\u201d Mr. Obama voiced similar concerns two weeks earlier, calling on young Democrats to move past \u201cwoke\u201d culture, which he sees as an impediment to creating a coalition that includes moderates, independents and Republicans who don\u2019t share their opinions on some issues. \u201cThat\u2019s not activism,\u201d he said during an event for the Obama Foundation in Chicago, that was disparaged by some critics as paternalistic. \u201cThat\u2019s not bringing about change.\u201d Mr. Obama is hardly undertaking a full-on intervention, and modulating criticism with statements of reassurance: He is not calling out Democrats by name, and by all accounts he has chosen not to get involved behind the scenes in playing favorites among the candidates. Yet Mr. Obama, who foreshadowed his public warnings in a closed-door pep talk for newly-elected House Democrats last spring, is clearly trying to make the case for a moderate and inclusive brand of politics \u2014 a message that helped him win in traditionally Republican states like Indiana and North Carolina in 2008. It is a viewpoint reflected in findings by a recent New York Times/Siena College poll of six battleground states showing that Democratic primary voters prefer candidates who pursue moderate, as opposed to liberal, policy goals. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to set a tone,\u201d said Robert Wolf, a friend of Mr. Obama and former chairman of UBS Americas, a part of the global investment firm. \u201cHe cares first about electability, whatever is second is a very distant second.\u201d Mr. Obama\u2019s coming remarks on Thursday will be part of an onstage interview with Thomas E. Perez, the Democratic National Committee chairman, at a fund-raising event in California. He has no plans to speak about the 2020 race for the rest of the year, according to the Obama aide who described his plans for Thursday. The former president\u2019s comments also reflect his own policy legacy, which has come in for modest questioning and criticism at times by some Democrats in the debates and on the campaign trail. (One friend said Mr. Obama had brushed off debate criticisms, joking that the eventual winner will \u201ccome back to me when they need me.\u201d) Mr. Obama was initially reluctant to attack Mr. Trump after he left the Oval Office, in part because he wanted to embrace the informal practice adopted by his predecessor, George W. Bush, of not attacking a presidential successor, former aides said. But he was also concerned that going after Mr. Trump would play into Republicans\u2019 hands by prompting a backlash, they added. By the 2018 midterms, Mr. Obama abandoned that reticence and campaigned aggressively against Mr. Trump, emboldened by the president\u2019s halfhearted response to his attacks. He also offered vague praise for the large-scale health care policy that Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren are now championing. \u201cDemocrats aren\u2019t just running on good old ideas like a higher minimum wage, but they\u2019re running on good new ideas like Medicare for all,\u201d he said in a speech at the University of Illinois in September of 2018. The big difference now is Mr. Obama\u2019s willingness to publicly criticize others in his party, however indirectly, something he had avoided. Katie Hill, a spokeswoman for Mr. Obama, said that he was not targeting Mr. Sanders or Ms. Warren in his remarks last week, and that his public declarations in support of the Democratic field and a diversity of opinions are the core of his message. \u201cSince leaving office, President Obama has worked to stay out of the political fray in part to let other, new voices in the Democratic Party rise up,\u201d Ms. Hill said on Wednesday. \u201cJust like in 2018, he\u2019ll be out on the campaign trail next fall working hard for whoever our nominee is.\u201d But Mr. Obama made it clear in his remarks to the Democracy Alliance that he sees the Medicare for all plan as a threat to the party among moderate voters, many of whom fear they will lose their private health coverage \u2014 giving them an excuse to support Mr. Trump in 2020. Mr. Sanders, responding to Mr. Obama\u2019s remarks last weekend, said: \u201cI\u2019m not tearing down the system. We\u2019re fighting for justice.\u201d Ms. Warren did not push back, and said she was \u201cgrateful\u201d for Mr. Obama\u2019s passage of the Affordable Care Act. But some on the party\u2019s left, including Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota were less accommodating, tweeting out the hashtag \u201c#TooFarLeft\u201d in disapproval. Mr. Obama has also quietly expressed concerns, as have many other Democrats, about the performance of his former vice president, Mr. Biden, especially in the debates, according to two Democrats with knowledge of the interactions. His unfinished book, a memoir spanning his eight years in office, is also weighing heavily on Mr. Obama, who sees it as his principal legacy project, a literary bookend to his highly-regarded 1995 autobiography \u201cDreams From My Father.\u201d The former president, a meticulous writer and chronic procrastinator, has blown through several self-imposed deadlines \u2014 he told Ms. Abrams it was \u201ca pain\u201d \u2014 and no one quite knows when it will be finished, according to two people with knowledge of the situation. The process of reliving his presidency day by day, writing in longhand and revising it with his speechwriter Cody Keenan, has put him in a reflective and, at times, feisty mood, associates say, making him more willing to express his thoughts to a wider audience. Mr. Obama has taken great care not to express his opinions about particular candidates \u2014 at least in earshot of anyone who will leak them \u2014 and has told people around him that he wants to avoid even the slightest perception that he is \u201cthumbing the scale\u201d for any candidate, as he did by tacitly backing Hillary Clinton\u2019s primary campaign in 2016. He has, nonetheless, offered personal support to Mr. Biden but has been careful to cast his efforts in personal, not political terms. Earlier this year, he described his motivation, telling Mr. Biden\u2019s brain trust that he did not want to see Mr. Biden \u201cembarrass himself.\u201d Mr. Obama\u2019s relationship with Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders has been more distant, but cordial. Both reached out to Mr. Obama shortly after they announced their candidacies earlier this year, and he offered each a bit of individualized advice, counseling Mr. Sanders to espouse \u201cmainstream\u201d ideas, a person close to the Vermont senator said. He urged Ms. Warren to embrace party \u201cunity,\u201d according to two people close to the Massachusetts senator. He has a deeper connection to former Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts, a close friend who has served on his foundation\u2019s board, and discussed the possibility of a campaign with Mr. Patrick last year, people close to both men said. But he now believes Mr. Patrick\u2019s entrance into the race last week came too late, these people say. Mr. Obama is acutely aware of timing when it comes to his own actions. His appearance at the conference was intended to reassure nervous donors that he had confidence in the ultimate outcome of the 2020 election. He added his warning to an outline of his remarks only a few days before the conference, a person involved in the planning said. \u201cThere are a lot of people who have been wanting him to get out there and mix it up more with Trump,\u201d said Gara LaMarche, president of the Democracy Alliance. \u201cPeople miss his voice. Even people in the room who didn\u2019t necessarily agree with what he had to say were happy to have him back in the fray.\u201d",

      "content": " LOS ALTOS HILLS, Calif. \u2014 Former President Barack Obama urged Democrats on Thursday to \u201cchill out\u201d about the party\u2019s 2020 field and to avoid putting candidates through \u201cpurity tests,\u201d and warned that average voters were \u201cnervous about changes that might take away what little they have.\u201d Speaking to party donors a day after the latest Democratic primary debate, Mr. Obama added to a series of recent remarks about American politics and the presidential race, including his warning on Friday that the candidates not move too far to the left in their policy proposals and his observation that the average American does not want to \u201ctear down the system.\u201d Mr. Obama\u2019s comments on Thursday appeared at times aimed more at Democratic officials, activists and donors than at the candidates themselves. Democrats should focus less on the \u201ctactical disagreements\u201d among the candidates, Mr. Obama said, and avoid making false choices between appealing to white working class voters or minority voters, or between energizing the party\u2019s base or reaching out to independents and Republicans. \u201cEverybody needs to chill out about the candidates, but gin up about the prospect of rallying behind\u201d a candidate, Mr. Obama said. \u201cThere will be differences\u201d among the candidates, Mr. Obama said, but the ultimate goal \u201cis to defeat a president and a party that has, I think, taken a sharp turn away from a lot of the core traditions and values and institutional commitments that built this country.\u201d With Democratic activists and voters now weighing the different policy ideas and positions of the candidates, Mr. Obama also warned against demanding that the party\u2019s hopefuls meet inflexible standards. \u201cI\u2019m always suspicious of purity tests during elections,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cBecause you know what? The country\u2019s complicated.\u201d Mr. Obama spoke to a group of about 100 donors in Los Altos Hills, Calif., during an interview with Thomas E. Perez, the Democratic National Committee chairman, at a fund-raising event for the Democratic Unity Fund, which will be used to help the party\u2019s eventual nominee. Aides to Mr. Obama say that it is the last time he plans to speak this year about the 2020 race. Mr. Obama did not single out any candidates by name, and said he was encouraged that they are proposing \u201cbolder\u201d ideas and expanding on policies that he tried to \u201cpush the envelope\u201d on during his administration, such as criminal justice reform. Still, he seemed to caution against pushing for too much change. \u201cWhen you listen to the average voter \u2014 even ones who aren\u2019t stalwart Democrats, but who are more independent or are low-information voters \u2014 they don\u2019t feel that things are working well, but they\u2019re also nervous about changes that might take away what little they have,\u201d he said. At the same time, Mr. Obama said he was open to the idea of higher taxes for the wealthy, adding that the conversation around the country has changed dramatically since his campaigns. \u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of room to pay more taxes \u2014 and I already pay really high taxes,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s one area where, I guarantee you, where you will get Joe six-pack and the single inner-city mom agreeing. They would like to see a little bigger share of the pie and you know, the rent is too damn high.\u201d The remarks come less than a week after Mr. Obama warned against Democratic presidential candidates moving too far to the left, jockeying to win over \u201cleft-leaning Twitter feeds\u201d rather than appealing to voters in the middle. In recent weeks, Mr. Obama has repeatedly said that the presidential candidates should stop being concerned with debates over ideological purity and instead focus on beating President Trump. Mr. Obama tried to \u201cease people\u2019s anxieties\u201d about his confidence in the field, saying that whoever emerges from the primary process will be a stronger candidate. \u201cTheir flaws are magnified,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cPeople are picking away: Well, you know they\u2019re not quite this and they\u2019re not quite that \u2014 you know it\u2019s a natural thing.\u201d Many Democratic voters say they are looking for a candidate they believe is most likely to win during the general election, and there have been extensive discussions about whether that means winning over white working class voters who voted for Mr. Obama and then Mr. Trump, or turning out voters who sat out the 2016 election. Mr. Obama told donors he believed that debate was a false choice. Mr. Perez pointed out that Mr. Obama won Iowa in 2008, suggesting that his winning coalition included both white voters as well as black and Hispanic voters. \u201cThere aren\u2019t a lot of black people in Iowa,\u201d Mr. Obama said, prompting loud laughter from the donors in the room. \u201cAt the end of the day, we are going to need everybody,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cWe will not win just by increasing the turnout of people who already agree with us completely on everything.\u201d Mr. Obama also spoke about the possibility of having a female nominee \u2014 there are five women now running \u2014 or a gay nominee. (Mayor Pete Buttigieg is the first major openly gay candidate in a Democratic presidential primary.) \u201cThose candidates are going to have barriers if they win the nomination, if they win the general election, just like I did.\u201d he said. \u201cAre there going to be people in the back of their mind thinking, \u2018Eh, I don\u2019t know.\u2019 Just like those who said I don\u2019t know about Barack Hussein Obama.\u201d",

      "author": "Lisa Lerer",
      "content": " Did Barack Obama just cancel himself? That\u2019s the question an editor here asked me on Saturday, as we watched comments Mr. Obama had made about the 2020 race reverberate across social media. In case you missed it: Mr. Obama expressed some thoughts at a meeting of wealthy donors in Washington on Friday night. Aides billed the event as a chance for him to calm some of the anxiety that establishment party types are expressing about the Democratic field. Mr. Obama did that, reminding them of how brutal his primary fight was against Hillary Clinton in 2008 \u2014 and, hey, that turned out O.K., right? Then, Mr. Obama\u2019s remarks veered into his own worries about the field. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should be deluded into thinking that the resistance to certain approaches to things is simply because voters haven\u2019t heard a bold enough proposal and if they hear something as bold as possible then immediately that\u2019s going to activate them,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople rightly are cautious because they don\u2019t have a lot of margin for error.\u201d \u201cThis is still a country that is less revolutionary than it is interested in improvement,\u201d he added. \u201cThey like seeing things improved, but the average American doesn\u2019t think we have to completely tear down the system and remake it.\u201d No one was mentioned by name. While Mr. Obama has spoken privately with nearly all the candidates, he\u2019s been very careful to avoid even the appearance of influencing the race. But it was pretty clear who Mr. Obama was talking about this time \u2014 Senators Elizabeth Warren (\u201cbig, structural change\u201d) and Bernie Sanders (\u201cpolitical revolution\u201d). I was covering his remarks and there wasn\u2019t much reaction from the room at the time. But by the next morning, tweets were flying, a hashtag had been created \u2014 people proudly proclaimed they were #TooFarLeft \u2014 and voters, activists and strategists were chattering. And, boy, did they have plenty to say. Mr. Obama got a resounding chorus of \u201cO.K. boomer\u201d from liberal activists, who questioned his record on issues like health care, climate change and immigration. Of course, as readers of this newsletter know, Twitter is not real life. The views of Democrats on social media often bear little resemblance to those in the wider electorate. Twitter Democrats are whiter, more liberal and more politically active, according to a New York Times analysis from earlier this year. People close to the former president say he wasn\u2019t bothered by the reaction. At this point in his life, he feels liberated to give what he sees as his best advice to his fellow Democrats based on his political experiences. And he\u2019s giving voice to concerns from moderates that have been bubbling up for several weeks now as Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders have shown resilience in the polls. But Mr. Obama\u2019s sentiments are in direct conflict with what the more liberal activists who have an outsize role in the party\u2019s politics and the nominating process have been expressing. Still, it\u2019s worth noting that my colleague Jenny Medina was at the California Democratic Convention in Long Beach on Saturday \u2014 and none of the political types she spoke to had seen the Twitter backlash to Mr. Obama\u2019s comments. If Mr. Obama was right about one thing, it\u2019s that the disconnect between the wings of the party is real. I want to know what you all think about Mr. Obama\u2019s remarks. Is he right that Democrats are playing risky politics by pushing to the left? Or, is his brand of more centrist politics simply not meeting today\u2019s \u201cfierce urgency of now?\u201d Email us at onpolitics@nytimes.com. Please include your name and location. We may feature you in an upcoming edition of this newsletter! Democrats scored a big victory in a second red state over the weekend, when Gov. John Bel Edwards won re-election by more than 40,000 votes in Louisiana. His victory came less than two weeks after another Democratic win, a narrow one in the Kentucky governor\u2019s race. President Trump had invested political capital in both off-year races, seeing potential Republican victories as a way to steady his political footing amid the drumbeat of impeachment news. In rallies before the elections, he cast the contests as a referendum on himself. \u201cYou got to give me a big win, please, O.K.,\u201d the president pleaded with his supporters last Thursday in Bossier City, La. Yet, officials on both sides of the aisle said those Democratic victories came in spite of the impeachment inquiry \u2014 not because of it. \u201cIt was not a help,\u201d Gov. Gina Raimondo of Rhode Island, who was deeply involved with all three races as head of the Democratic Governors Association, told me on Sunday evening. \u201cCandidly, it made it more difficult, if anything.\u201d We\u2019ve spent a lot of time analyzing how impeachment may be affecting our politics. These two races give us the start of an answer. For months, Speaker Nancy Pelosi refused to start House impeachment proceedings, pointing to the reluctance of her members who had flipped more moderate, suburban districts in the midterms, handing Democrats control of the chamber. Now we have some evidence for the political rationale behind her hesitation: In deeply conservative states like Louisiana and Kentucky, which Mr. Trump won in 2016 by 20 points and 30 points, the House impeachment process rallied his base, according to Ms. Raimondo \u2014 encouraging Mr. Trump\u2019s voters to turn out and defend him. But any Republican backlash against impeachment wasn\u2019t enough to elevate the Republican candidates who had tied themselves to Mr. Trump. In these two governor\u2019s races, the pro-Trump turnout was still smaller than the coalition of African-Americans and moderate whites in suburbs and cities energized to come out and support the Democrats, who were well known in their states. (Republicans did pick up a win in the Mississippi governor\u2019s election.) That dynamic happening in conservative states should be a big, flashing danger sign for the president, who will be fighting for his re-election in far more purple places. Much of the outcome of the 2020 race is likely to depend on whether either party \u2014 or an event like the impeachment inquiry \u2014 is able to alter that balance.
