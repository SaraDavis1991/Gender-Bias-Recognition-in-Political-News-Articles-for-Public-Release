      "content": " Senator John McCain began running this 30-second television commercial yesterday in South Carolina. It is titled ''Can Win.'' PRODUCER -- Stevens Reed Curcio & Company ON THE SCREEN -- With dramatic theme music in the background, a series of clips show Senator McCain campaigning before cheering crowds. The words ''character,'' ''courage,'' ''ready to lead'' and ''vote John McCain for president'' flash on the screen. TEXT -- Announcer: ''John McCain. The character to do what's right.'' McCain: ''I'm going to give the government back to you, and I promise you that.'' Announcer: ''The courage to fight for it. A Republican like Ronald Reagan who can win.'' McCain: ''I'm going to beat Al Gore like a drum. You will always hear the truth from me, no matter what.'' Announcer: ''This Saturday, vote John McCain for president.'' SCORECARD -- This is the first new commercial Senator McCain has put on the air since he vowed not to run more advertisements attacking Gov. George W. Bush. It focuses on the two main points Mr. McCain now emphasizes in his campaign: his character and, by invoking former President Ronald Reagan and Mr. Gore, the likely Democratic nominee, his ability to win by attracting independent and Democratic voters. It is the first time one of Mr. McCain's television advertisements has mentioned Mr. Reagan. DAVID E. ROSENBAUM",

      "content": "Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the Missouri Democrat who has often been mentioned as a running mate for Senator John Kerry, is talking kindly about another choice: Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona. Asked after a speech in California on Monday what he thought of Mr. McCain's potential for the Democratic presidential ticket, Mr. Gephardt described him as a ''very attractive figure in American politics'' who ''would be accepted by the Democratic Party,'' according to CNN. Mr. McCain is ''someone a lot of Democrats could get interested in,'' Mr. Gephardt said at the Leon Panetta Center in Monterrey. The kind words for Mr. McCain, who has categorically rejected the idea of joining the Kerry ticket, came a day after Ralph Nader, an independent candidate for president, advised Mr. Kerry to forget about Mr. McCain and choose either Mr. Gephardt or Senator John Edwards of North Carolina. ''McCain really should be taken at his word,'' Mr. Nader said on ABC's ''This Week.'' ''He's not going to do it.''",

      "author": "Carl Hulse",
      "content": " Senator Joseph Biden urged Senator John McCain point-blank to consider joining the Democratic ticket as the vice presidential candidate, taking to a new level the talk of Mr. McCain running with John Kerry. \"I would still urge John Kerry to pick up the phone and call John McCain,\" said Mr. Biden, a Delaware Democrat, as he appeared on \"Meet the Press\" with Senator McCain, the Arizona Republican ( Transcript ). \"He'll say no, probably. But I think John Kerry has an obligation to do that for the way he wants to heal, and I know John will listen. He'll say no, but I want to tell you, I'm counting on him being a more loyal American than he is a loyal Republican.\" Mr. Biden's comments came after Mr. McCain said he \"categorically\" would not consider such an offer. His rejection followed an article in Saturday's New York Times that said Democrats were continuing to try to develop a scenario for Mr. McCain to come aboard as part of a unity ticket in opposition to President Bush. \"I work with President Bush on a lot of issues and I want him re-elected and I'm not looking back in anger at anything,\" said Mr. McCain. The latter part of his comment was a reference to the attacks the Bush campaign unleashed on him in the 2000 presidential race. But no matter how unequivocal Mr. McCain makes his denials, he always manages to keep the door open a slight crack, at least enough to keep the speculation alive. `I will always take anyone's phone calls,\" Mr. McCain told Tim Russert, the program's host. Perhaps the funniest part of the McCain moment was when he tried to duck the whole question. He referred back to the awkward earlier incident on \"Meet the Press,\" when Mr. Russert was interviewing Secretary of State Colin Powell from the Middle East, and an aide to Mr. Powell had apparently decided the interview should end, and the camera switched to a shot of palm trees. \"I'd like to have the camera to move over to a palm tree to start with,\" said Mr. McCain as he was pressed on the vice presidential question.",

      "author": "Nick Corasaniti",
      "content": " GREEN BAY, Wis. \u2014 Donald J. Trump belatedly endorsed the re-elections of Speaker Paul D. Ryan and Senators John McCain and Kelly Ayotte on Friday, moving to heal a deepening rift within the Republican Party touched off by Mr. Trump\u2019s feud with the parents of a slain American soldier. \u201cI support and endorse our speaker of the House, Paul Ryan,\u201d Mr. Trump said at a rally here after announcing his backing of the senators. \u201cHe\u2019s a good man. We may disagree on a couple of things, but mostly we agree.\u201d Mr. Trump ignited a controversy within his party on Tuesday when he said he was not \u201cquite there yet\u201d in supporting Mr. Ryan, echoing a similar line of doubt that Mr. Ryan, the nation\u2019s most powerful elected Republican, had cast before eventually endorsing Mr. Trump for president. The endorsement on Friday, in Mr. Ryan\u2019s home state, Wisconsin, had the rollout of a carefully crafted campaign event. A fund-raising email was sent to supporters immediately after Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement. Moments later, subscribers to Trump campaign texts received an alert that said, \u201cParty unity will help Make America Great Again.\u201d He read the endorsement from a script. But before he got to those words, he spent several minutes in the off-the-cuff mode he is known for. He predicted that the Green Bay Packers would have a strong season, excoriated Hillary Clinton and argued that the news media had misconstrued his suggestion at a previous event that a crying baby be escorted out. \u201cThe baby that had a voice that was superior to Pavarotti,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI want to sponsor that baby.\u201d Mr. Trump turned the speech into a hatchet-burying trifecta. He threw his support to Ms. Ayotte, who is facing a tight race in New Hampshire to retain her Senate seat. Mr. Ryan and Mr. McCain, an Arizona senator, are also up for re-election, beginning with primaries next week. \u201cI need a Republican Senate and a House to accomplish all of the change we have to make,\u201d Mr. Trump said. He added, \u201cI understand and embrace the wisdom of Ronald Reagan\u2019s big tent within the party.\u201d \u201cBig, big tent,\u201d he said. \u201cRemember?\u201d He paused to ask the Democrats in the crowd to raise their hands. Hardly anyone made a sound. Mr. Trump, looking unimpressed, offered that he did not need Democrats anyway. With the speech, Mr. Trump sought to move past a tumultuous week that began with his disparaging members of a Gold Star military family who had spoken out against him at the Democratic National Convention. Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks drew rebukes from many Republicans, including Mr. Ryan, Mr. McCain and Ms. Ayotte, and set the course for the next few days. He caused a tempest with his remarks regarding Mr. Ryan and another with repeated proclamations about viewing a \u201csecret tape\u201d that showed Iran receiving pallets of cash from the United States. Perhaps signaling that he was in a forgiving and unifying mood, Mr. Trump on Friday morning issued a rare admission of an error, explaining on Twitter that the footage he had thought was a secret tape was instead a widely shown clip of American prisoners arriving in Geneva after being released by Iran. His squabbling with Mr. Ryan and the senators threatened to further splinter Mr. Trump\u2019s relationship with the party and infuriated many officials, including Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee. Mr. Trump\u2019s running mate, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, publicly, but peacefully, disagreed with him and backed Mr. Ryan. Mr. Priebus had made clear he hoped that Mr. Trump would get behind Mr. Ryan and the senators but told the nominee that he had to make the decision on his own. The endorsement of Mr. Ryan is unlikely to assuage some Republicans who are concerned by the combative Trump campaign and have grown frustrated that the near-daily controversies have made it more difficult to focus on Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic nominee. On Friday, Gov. John Kasich of Ohio told CNN that he was considering voting Democratic for the first time. \u201cLet\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves,\u201d Mr. Kasich said in response to a question on the possibility that he would not vote for a Republican for president. He added: \u201cI wish that I could be fully enthusiastic. I can\u2019t be. So I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen at the end.\u201d In Wisconsin, a battleground state where Mr. Trump lost a primary decisively to Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and endured unrelenting criticism from local conservative radio hosts, the speaker of the State House of Representatives greeted Mr. Trump with an open letter to fellow Republicans, saying, \u201cWe are Ryan Republicans here in Wisconsin, not Trump Republicans.\u201d \u201cAs Donald Trump has said stupid things and been rude to so many people over the past year, I usually chalked it up to inexperience and the spotlight of an incredibly hostile press,\u201d the speaker, Robin Vos, wrote. \u201cBut since the convention, his lack of judgment has got to concern even the most ardent Trump supporters.\u201d And less than an hour before Mr. Trump took the stage, Mr. Ryan gave an interview to WISN, a Milwaukee radio station, offering more criticism of the presidential nominee. \u201cI hope he doesn\u2019t keep doing things like this and distort conservative principles that we have to defend,\u201d Mr. Ryan told the station. He said he had not \u201cchanged anything\u201d with regard to his support of Mr. Trump, but added: \u201cI wish he would be a little more disciplined. What I say to him privately and what I\u2019ve said publicly is Hillary Clinton is the one to focus on, not another Republican, not a private citizen criticizing you.\u201d Mr. Trump made his endorsement after striking notes of unity on Friday afternoon at a rally in Des Moines. He praised Mr. Priebus, saying he was doing a \u201cfantastic job,\u201d and complimented Mr. Pence, who was on the campaign trail with him for the first time since they had taken divergent positions on Mr. Ryan\u2019s primary campaign. \u201cIf you don\u2019t like me, that\u2019s O.K.,\u201d Mr. Trump told the Iowa crowd. \u201cVote for Pence because it\u2019s the same thing.\u201d Mr. Trump also focused his message in Des Moines on Mrs. Clinton, peppering his remarks with extended riffs and insult lines against her and President Obama. \u201cShe is pretty close to unhinged,\u201d Mr. Trump said, criticizing Mrs. Clinton\u2019s immigration and foreign policy positions, in particular with regard to Iran. He also floated a conspiracy theory that the National Security Agency had the 33,000 deleted emails from Mrs. Clinton\u2019s account (there is no record, report or indication that this is true). \u201cDoes N.S.A. have them? I don\u2019t know,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cSome people have been saying that, that the N.S.A. has them.\u201d The Clinton campaign has been quick to seize on Mr. Trump\u2019s recent controversies. At a rally Friday afternoon in Milwaukee, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, took aim at Mr. Trump for withholding endorsements of Mr. Ryan and Mr. McCain. \u201cWhile we\u2019ve been talking about jobs, Donald Trump has been going after a family of a war hero, or Donald Trump has been going after fellow Republicans and talking about why he won\u2019t endorse them in their primaries,\u201d Mr. Kaine said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about jobs, and Donald Trump is basically shadowboxing with every enemy he can think of instead of talking about what Americans want to talk about.\u201d",

I like people who weren\u2019t captured.\u201dBy Jonathan Martin and Alan RappeportPRINT EDITIONNo Hero, Trump Says of McCain, Stirring Outrage|July 19, 2015, Page A1",
      "author": "Jonathan Martin",
      "content": "  AMES, Iowa \u2014 Donald J. Trump has made his name in politics with provocative statements, but it was not until Saturday, after the flamboyant businessman turned presidential candidate belittled Senator John McCain\u2019s war record, that many Republicans concluded that silence or equivocation about Mr. Trump\u2019s incendiary rhetoric was inadequate. Mr. Trump upended a Republican presidential forum here, and the race more broadly, by saying of the Arizona senator and former prisoner of war: \u201cHe\u2019s not a war hero. He\u2019s a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren\u2019t captured.\u201d Mr. McCain, a naval aviator, was shot down during the Vietnam War and held prisoner for more than five years in Hanoi, refusing early release even after being repeatedly beaten. Mr. Trump and Mr. McCain have been engaged in a war of words over the past week, since the Arizona senator said that Mr. Trump was riling up \u201ccrazies\u201d in the party with the inflammatory remarks about illegal immigrants from Mexico. Yet Mr. Trump\u2019s comments on Saturday drew condemnation from his rivals and senior officials in the party at a scale far greater than the response to his portrayal of Mexican immigrants as rapists. The response was an indication of the reverence many Republicans have for military service and sacrifice. But it was also something more: their best opening yet to marginalize Mr. Trump. After weeks when many of them treaded lightly around Mr. Trump,\u00a0who once again\u00a0Saturday\u00a0refused to rule out a third-party run, Republican leaders seized the opportunity to unambiguously speak out against a candidate they see as effectively hijacking their primaries. Yet for all the outrage among party elites, some attendees at the Christian conservative conference where Mr. Trump made his comments were not nearly as offended, a reminder of the chasm between the Republican power structure and its grass roots. With his attack on Mr. McCain, Mr. Trump, whose caustic language about immigration has lifted him in early polls, created a new, revealing litmus test for how the Republican presidential hopefuls are handling the bombastic real estate mogul. Several of Mr. Trump\u2019s Republican opponents immediately denounced his comments, and one said the remarks disqualified him from the presidency. \u201cDonald Trump owes every American veteran and in particular John McCain an apology,\u201d said Rick Perry, the former Texas governor, upon taking the stage. Mr. Perry argued that Mr. Trump\u2019s comment made him unfit to be commander in chief. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said that anybody serious about being president would not be disrespectful of prisoners of war, and predicted that the early nominating states would render an unmistakable verdict on Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy. \u201cHere\u2019s what I think they\u2019re going to say: \u2018Donald Trump, you\u2019re fired,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Mr. Graham said to laughs and applause. For Mr. Perry and Mr. Graham, both retired Air Force officers who have struggled to get traction in the race, Mr. Trump\u2019s comments represented an opportunity to highlight their own military service and demonstrate to primary voters that they would not tolerate any impugning of a veteran. As telling was the difference between how Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas reacted to Mr. Trump. Both are running aggressively in Iowa and pursuing the sort of conservative voters who are now considering Mr. Trump. Mr. Walker, who leads in early Iowa polls, had previously resisted criticizing Mr. Trump. But in a sign of how quickly Mr. Trump\u2019s provocation reshaped the expectations of how candidates should treat him, Mr. Walker immediately changed course after Mr. Trump questioned Mr. McCain\u2019s military record. \u201cI unequivocally denounce him,\u201d Mr. Walker said at a campaign stop in Sioux City, Iowa. Mr. Cruz, who poses a threat here on Mr. Walker\u2019s right, was more cautious. He told reporters before his remarks here that Mr. McCain is \u201can American hero,\u201d but added that he would not \u201csay something bad about Donald Trump.\u201d Mr. Cruz\u2019s reluctance to confront Mr. Trump was perhaps best explained by the reaction to Mr. Perry\u2019s denunciation: While many in the crowd applauded, the ovation did not last long and nobody in the audience of nearly 3,000 stood to show their approval. \u201cIt was not important to me,\u201d said Rose Kendall, an attendee from Burlington, Iowa, of Mr. Trump\u2019s comment on Mr. McCain. \u201cHe said that because John McCain talked him down.\u201d Many Democrats noted that there had been far less opprobrium for Mr. Trump after he began his candidacy in June by saying of Mexican immigrants: \u201cThey\u2019re bringing drugs, they\u2019re bringing crime. They\u2019re rapists and some, I assume, are good people.\u201d Republicans also treated the businessman more delicately in the 2012 campaign, when Mitt Romney, the party\u2019s nominee, sought and publicly accepted Mr. Trump\u2019s endorsement even after the businessman had questioned whether President Obama was born in the United States. Speaking to reporters after his turn on stage, Mr. Trump tried to soften the remarks, saying that any United States veteran who was a prisoner of war was heroic. He also shifted his comments to assuage veterans, saying that Mr. McCain had failed to address their needs. \u201cI\u2019m with the veterans all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cI consider them heroes.\u201d Asked about his own military draft status, Mr. Trump, 69, said that he received medical deferments from the Vietnam War because of a bone spur in his foot. Mr. Trump could not recall which foot was afflicted. Yet Mr. Trump\u2019s awkward and ill-suited remarks about religion and marriage here may have done more damage to his candidacy, at least with Christian conservatives. \u201cI\u2019m a religious person,\u201d Mr. Trump offered. \u201cI go to church. Do I do things that are wrong? I guess so.\u201d Mr. Trump also struggled to answer if he had ever sought forgiveness from God, before reluctantly acknowledging that he had not. \u201cIf I do something wrong, I try to do something right,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t bring God into that picture.\u201d And Mr. Trump raised eyebrows with language rarely heard before an evangelical audience \u2014 saying \u201cdamn\u201d and \u201chell\u201d when discussing education and the economy \u2014 while also describing the taking of communion in glib terms. \u201cWhen we go in church and I drink the little wine, which is about the only wine I drink, and I eat the little cracker \u2014 I guess that\u2019s a form of asking forgiveness,\u201d Mr. Trump said. If all that was not enough to roil the button-downed crowd, he also described his three marriages in starkly frank terms, conceding that he had difficulty finding a work-life balance. \u201cIt was a work thing, it wasn\u2019t a bad thing,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cIt was very hard for anybody to compete against the work.\u201d Despite his marital problems over the years, Mr. Trump said that he was always available to his children and that he did his best to have dinner with them on most nights even when his work was grueling. He worked hard, he said, to instill good values and steer them away from drugs, alcohol and cigarettes. \u201cI was actually a great father,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI was a better father than I was a husband.\u201d It was these comments, not his attack on Mr. McCain, that prompted the most muttering and unease in the audience. \u201cWell, I was turned off at the very start because I didn\u2019t like his language,\u201d Becky Kruse, of Lovilia, Iowa, said of Mr. Trump, not mentioning his comments about Mr. McCain. Ms. Kruse said she likes Mr. Trump\u2019s hard line on immigration and came to the event considering him. \u201cI was not too impressed,\u201d she said, noting Mr. Trump\u2019s comment about not seeking God\u2019s forgiveness. \u201cHe sounds like he isn\u2019t really a born-again Christian.\u201d",

      "author": "Jennifer Steinhauer",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Senator John McCain sharply criticized Donald J. Trump\u2019s comments about the family of a fallen Muslim Army captain on Monday, a rebuke that provided an opening for other vulnerable Republican senators to do the same, even though they all stopped short of rescinding their endorsements of him. \u201cWhile our party has bestowed upon him the nomination, it is not accompanied by unfettered license to defame those who are the best among us,\u201d Mr. McCain, a war hero whose service and capture in Vietnam were also once derided by Mr. Trump, said in a remarkable and lengthy written reproach of his party\u2019s presidential nominee. Within an hour, other embattled Republican senators, who like Mr. McCain are trying to stand between the forces propelling Mr. Trump and those he offends, offered their own condemnations. They were soon joined by President Obama, who chastised Mr. Trump without naming him, and the head of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, Brian Duffy. Mr. Duffy said his organization would not \u201ctolerate anyone berating a Gold Star family member for exercising his or her right of speech or expression.\u201d Senator Kelly Ayotte, Republican of New Hampshire, whose husband is a veteran of the Iraq war and who is fighting to win a second term, said Monday that she was \u201cappalled\u201d by Mr. Trump\u2019s comments. A spokeswoman for Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, also weighed in, as did Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania. They denounced Mr. Trump\u2019s words but did not reverse their endorsements. \u201cI remember how much I worried about my son Matt during his years of active duty,\u201d said Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri. \u201cThe Khans have made the greatest possible sacrifice for our country; they deserve to be heard and respected.\u201d Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, told The Des Moines Register: \u201cMr. Trump\u2019s comments are not in line with my own beliefs about how the members of the military and their families should be treated.\u201d Despite the intensifying criticism from Republican Party leaders, Mr. Trump on Monday showed no sign of relenting in his clash with the fallen soldier\u2019s family. He has not apologized for his suggestion that the soldier\u2019s father, Khizr Khan, might have forbidden his wife to speak during his address last week at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, nor has Mr. Trump acknowledged the mounting rebukes from respected Republicans like Mr. McCain. On Monday morning, Mr. Trump continued to criticize Mr. Khan, whose son Capt. Humayun Khan was killed in Iraq in 2004. Mr. Trump complained that Mr. Khan had become a ubiquitous presence in the news media since his speech at the convention, in which he excoriated the Republican presidential nominee. \u201cMr. Khan, who does not know me, viciously attacked me from the stage of the DNC and is now all over T.V. doing the same,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. \u201cNice!\u201d In a second post, Mr. Trump shifted course and said the campaign should be focused on terrorism. \u201cThis story is not about Mr. Khan, who is all over the place doing interviews, but rather RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM and the U.S.,\u201d he wrote. \u201cGet smart!\u201d At a town-hall-style gathering on Monday in Columbus, Ohio, Mr. Trump did not mention the Khans but said of veterans, \u201cI know the vets. I think I have tremendous support with the vets.\u201d His running mate, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, was asked about Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks at a campaign stop in Carson City, Nev., on Monday evening. After calling Captain Khan an American hero, Mr. Pence defended Mr. Trump, saying that he \u201csupports our soldiers and supports our veterans like no other leader in my lifetime.\u201d Even as pressure increased from establishment Republicans who have been calling for repudiation of Mr. Trump, neither Speaker Paul D. Ryan nor Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, has pulled his support for Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy. They offered statements on Sunday in support of the Khan family, but did not mention Mr. Trump by name. For congressional Republicans, Mr. Trump\u2019s inflammatory remarks are a vexing challenge. On one hand, they want to distance themselves just enough to try to grab support from voters of both parties who do not intend to vote for Mr. Trump but may split their tickets. But they do not want to outright flip on their prior endorsements of Mr. Trump, because they need his supporters\u2019 votes to win, too. \u201cThese candidates have refused to walk the tightrope the media creates and have instead forged their own path, with their own views and sentiments about an agenda for the future,\u201d said Josh Holmes, Mr. McConnell\u2019s former chief of staff, who now works as a Republican consultant. \u201cBy defining the race on their own terms, they have reminded voters they have a senator who is looking out for their interests regardless of how they may feel about the presidential nominees.\u201d Republican leaders believe they need to continue to support Mr. Trump, if only to provide cover for the party\u2019s candidates up for re-election. Republicans struggle to name policy positions of Mr. Trump that they prefer to those of his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, but they often settle on their fear of the type of justices a President Clinton would name to the Supreme Court. \u201cThere is obviously a concern about having a Democratic president and Senate confirming justices both on the Supreme Court and across the federal bench,\u201d said Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona. \u201cI certainly am concerned about that, too, and I know it will cause some people to ignore or justify statements he has made that for many of us raises concerns.\u201d Aides to Republicans up for re-election also say, for the most part, they see no evidence in the polls that Mr. Trump has been a drag on lower-level races. This is particularly interesting since ticket splitting \u2014 when voters pick one party\u2019s candidate for the White House and another for the House or Senate \u2014 has declined precipitously in recent years. Mr. McCain is the embodiment of the internal conflict Republican candidates face. Reverence for the military has been at the core of Mr. McCain\u2019s career \u2014 he was his party\u2019s nominee for president in 2008 and is chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee \u2014 and he has a close allegiance to families of those killed in conflict. \u201cI wear a bracelet bearing the name of a fallen hero, Matthew Stanley, which his mother, Lynn, gave me in 2007 at a town-hall meeting in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire,\u201d Mr. McCain said in his written statement. \u201cHis memory and the memory of our great leaders deserve better from me.\u201d \u201cMake no mistake: I do not valorize our military out of some unfamiliar instinct,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI grew up in a military family, and have my own record of service, and have stayed closely engaged with our armed forces throughout my public career. In the American system, the military has value only inasmuch as it protects and defends the liberties of the people.\u201d He added: \u201cI claim no moral superiority over Donald Trump. I have a long and well-known public and private record for which I will have to answer at the Final Judgment, and I repose my hope in the promise of mercy and the moderation of age. I challenge the nominee to set the example for what our country can and should represent.\u201d Mr. McCain\u2019s family has also been critical of Mr. Trump. His daughter Meghan McCain said on Twitter on Saturday: \u201cI would ask what kind of barbarian would attack the parents of a fallen soldier, but oh yeah it\u2019s the same person who attacks POW\u2019s.\u201d Without naming Mr. Trump, Mr. Obama made his message clear when he said that \u201cno one \u2014 no one \u2014 has given more for our freedom and security than our Gold Star families.\u201d Mr. Duffy, the national commander of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, was far more direct. \u201cThere are certain sacrosanct subjects that no amount of wordsmithing can repair once crossed,\u201d he said.",

      "author": "Carl Hulse",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Senator John McCain wasn\u2019t interested in getting the last word on his decades at the center of American political life. He was interested in getting thousands of them. In a new 380-page memoir written as he confronts brain cancer and his mortality, the occasionally ornery maverick Republican from Arizona looks back on a series of major episodes from both his own history and the United States\u2019. He recounts his presidential runs, his leading roles in fights over immigration, campaign finance, health care and foreign policy. He takes a few shots at President Trump, talk radio \u201cblowhards\u201d and House backbenchers. He says he would like Americans to \u201crecover our sense that we are more alike than different.\u201d True to his nature, John McCain is not one to go quietly. \u201cIt should be required reading for anyone who wants to lead in a democracy,\u201d said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and Mr. McCain\u2019s best friend in the Senate. He sees the book as a call to arms around the idea that \u201cAmerica\u2019s values make us better than our enemies.\u201d Mr. Graham visited Mr. McCain on Tuesday in Arizona, where they watched their favorite western, one that features an idealistic senator: \u201cThe Man Who Shot Liberty Valance.\u201d Mr. Graham found Mr. McCain upbeat and gaining strength. \u201cI hope he has another run in him,\u201d said Mr. Graham, reflecting a sentiment shared widely in Washington. Written with his frequent collaborator Mark Salter, a former aide and longtime adviser of Mr. McCain\u2019s, the book is titled, \u201cThe Restless Wave,\u201d in a nod to the long naval tradition of the McCain family. It is reminiscent of the 2009 valedictory \u201cTrue Compass,\u201d written by Senator Edward M. Kennedy, who died of cancer shortly before its publication. The form of glioblastoma that claimed Mr. Kennedy and is now putting Mr. McCain in peril is just another of the ties between two larger-than-life figures in a Senate that has fewer and fewer of them. In the pages of his memoir, Mr. McCain doesn\u2019t surrender to the disease, but he clearly accepts that his time may be short. \u201cLike my friend Ted, I might have fought my last immigration battle,\u201d Mr. McCain writes, noting that though he sponsored a new measure with a Democratic colleague, \u201cI\u2019m not as sure that I\u2019ve sufficient time left to see it all the way through. That, alas, isn\u2019t my call to make.\u201d One question arising from Mr. McCain\u2019s illness and his extended absence from Washington is what will become of the Senate with fewer members with the force of personality, political standing and will to bring increasingly polarized lawmakers together on major issues? Mr. McCain notes in his book that Mr. Kennedy \u201cgave value no other senator had\u201d when developing legislation because of his outsize influence on Democrats and his overall level of respect in the institution. Mr. McCain achieved that stature, as well, as one of the few senators able to command the attention of members of both parties on big topics. The absence of Mr. McCain\u2019s voice is particularly notable this week with foreign policy moves such as the White House decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal as well as a debate over past C.I.A. torture \u2014 a topic that Mr. McCain can speak to like no one else because of his mistreatment as a captive in Vietnam. He weighed in Wednesday night on Twitter, saying that the refusal of Gina Haspel, the nominee for C.I.A. director, to acknowledge that torture was immoral was disqualifying, but his statement probably didn\u2019t have the same power it would have had Mr. McCain taken the Senate floor to deliver it surrounded by colleagues and televised on C-Span. Casting about the Senate, it is hard to identify others who today hold similar potential to move colleagues away from hardened positions. Mr. McCain might not always triumph, but he knew how to force the issue on subjects many in the chamber would just as soon avoid for political reasons. But even Mr. McCain struggled with the new tribal politics, tempering some of his more moderate instincts when he faced challenges from the right in his recent re-election campaigns. It is only now, with no more campaigns ahead of him, that he is truly liberated from conventional political considerations. \u201cI\u2019m freer than colleagues who will face the voters again,\u201d he says in the book. \u201cI can speak my mind without fearing the consequence much. And I can vote my conscience without worry.\u201d That freedom was on vivid display over the summer when Mr. McCain played a deciding role in preventing Republican colleagues from repealing the Affordable Care Act. First, he returned from a draining cancer treatment to deliver a stirring speech for more bipartisanship. He recalls in the book how those remarks provoked tears from fellow senators even though \u201cI had argued with every single one of them, and I\u2019m certain I had offended more than a few of them.\u201d (Fact check: definitely true.) Days later, he cast a dramatic post-midnight, thumbs-down vote that blocked a desperate effort to deliver on a major Republican campaign promise by overturning the health care law. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel that dramatic to me at the time,\u201d Mr. McCain says. He admits to feeling bad about disappointing his fellow Republicans. \u201cIt was a hard vote that I didn\u2019t make easily, but not one I would hesitate to make again.\u201d It was at its heart a vote for a return to what\u2019s known in Congress as \u201cregular order,\u201d a less partisan, more civil and results-driven process during which lawmakers from both parties cooperate to produce a consensus product. Mr. McCain notes gleefully in the book that he was once attacked by an opponent as a \u201cchampion of compromise.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re damn right, I\u2019m a champion of compromise in the governance of a country of 325 million opinionated, quarrelsome, vociferous souls,\u201d he writes. \u201cThere is no other way to govern an open society, or more precisely, to govern it effectively.\u201d Mr. McCain, who has an explosive temper, has long been one of the more prickly members of the Senate. But as in his relationship with Mr. Kennedy, he was usually able to put aside hard feelings. For instance, he enjoyed multiple nasty exchanges over the years with Harry Reid of Nevada, the former Democratic leader, but says, \u201cI could never quite sustain a permanent dislike for the guy.\u201d As for Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, Mr. McCain said reports of friction between them are overblown (though Mr. McConnell did take his fight against his colleague\u2019s signature campaign finance law to the Supreme Court). Mr. McCain doesn\u2019t seek sympathy and says he hopes those who mourn his passing, \u201cand even those who don\u2019t,\u201d should lead \u201clives as lucky as mine.\u201d Most of Mr. McCain\u2019s Senate colleagues consider themselves lucky to have shared their service with him and worry about the consequences of the loss of such a unique political figure.",

      "author": "Mark Landler",
      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 The White House\u2019s directive to hide a Navy destroyer named after Senator John McCain during President Trump\u2019s recent visit to a naval base in Japan was driven, administration officials said on Thursday, by a fear of bad visuals \u2014 the name of the president\u2019s nemesis clearly visible in photographs of him. In truth, it would have been a bad visual for only one person: Mr. Trump. Yet an effort to airbrush an American warship by covering its name with a giant tarp and then hiding it with a barge demonstrates how anxious the Trump administration has become about the grudges of the president. It also shows the extraordinary lengths officials in the bureaucracy are willing to go to avoid provoking Mr. Trump. Sailors from the McCain were not invited to Mr. Trump\u2019s speech on another ship, the Wasp, at the Yokosuka Naval Base, although crew members from most other American ships at the base were, a Navy service member based at Yokosuka said. When several sailors from the McCain \u2014 wearing uniforms that bore the ship\u2019s name and insignia \u2014 turned up anyway at the Wasp to hear Mr. Trump\u2019s speech, they were turned away, the service member said. The service member, who requested anonymity because he was not allowed to speak publicly, said that a gate guard told the two sailors they were not allowed on the Wasp because they were from the McCain. [What you need to know about about the U.S.S. John S. McCain] The hide-the-ship scheme, which Mr. Trump insisted he knew nothing about but called a \u201cwell meaning\u201d gesture, drew a torrent of criticism on Thursday from retired military officers. They said it was an egregious attempt to politicize the armed forces, while Democratic lawmakers termed it petty vindictiveness against a dead war hero. The episode came at the end of a visit in which Mr. Trump had already sided with a foreign dictator against his national security adviser over the threat posed by North Korean missiles, and joined the North Korean regime in heaping ridicule on a former vice president, Joseph R. Biden Jr. The email instructing the Navy to obscure the ship, the John S. McCain, came from the White House military operations office, after consultation with a White House advance team working in Japan, according to an administration official. The Navy initially complied with the order by hanging a tarp over the ship\u2019s name. But higher-level officers got wind of the plan and ordered the tarp removed and the barge moved before Mr. Trump arrived. \u201cIt sounds like someone in the chain of command made a boneheaded mistake in judgment,\u201d said Jack Keane, a retired Army general who advises Mr. Trump and said he once tried to broker a reconciliation between him and Mr. McCain. It is not clear, in any event, if Mr. Trump even saw the McCain during his brief visit. He arrived in Yokosuka on Marine One, and addressed the sailors in a hangar bay below decks on the Wasp. The acting defense secretary, Patrick Shanahan, has denied knowing about the White House directive and on Friday during a trip to Singapore said that he would not have moved the ship. But questions about why the Navy has acquiesced to it are likely to dog Mr. Shanahan when he goes before the Senate for his confirmation hearing in the coming weeks. Mr. Trump is not the first president to politicize the military: George W. Bush famously landed on the deck of the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln and spoke to sailors under a banner proclaiming \u201cMission Accomplished\u201d during the Iraq war. Nor is he the first president to nurse grudges: Richard M. Nixon once ordered a reference to the \u201cBattle Hymn of the Republic\u201d deleted from a speech because it was a \u201cKennedy song,\u201d played at the funeral of Robert F. Kennedy. But Mr. Trump has taken both habits to greater extremes. Some of the nearly 1,000 sailors and Marines at his speech in Japan wore round patches emblazoned with a likeness of Mr. Trump and the words \u201cMake Aircrew Great Again\u201d \u2014 a play on his campaign slogan \u2014 on their flight suits. Critics said Mr. Trump\u2019s animus for Mr. McCain set off a cascade of decisions by lower-level officials that not only dishonored the senator\u2019s memory but also disrespected the sailors who serve on the McCain. In addition to Mr. McCain, the ship is named after his grandfather, John S. McCain Sr., a Navy admiral during World War II, and his father, John S. McCain Jr., an admiral in the Vietnam War era. \u201cIt\u2019s beyond petty,\u201d Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the ranking Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s disgraceful, and the White House should be embarrassed.\u201d The McCain had already suffered tragedy. The ship, which fired missiles during the Iraq war and survived cat-and-mouse games with Chinese vessels in the South China Sea, was docked at the base in Yokosuka for repairs after a deadly crash off the coasts of Singapore and Malaysia in August 2017, when it collided with a merchant marine vessel. Ten sailors died in the accident. Mr. McCain took a personal interest in the ship, visiting it in 2015 in Vietnam, where he had been held as a prisoner of war. Cmdr. Micah Murphy, who took command of the ship after the accident, once served as a legislative fellow to the senator. He declined to comment on Thursday. Mr. Trump said he would not have ordered the ship to be hidden, but he declined to apologize to the sailors who had been kept out of his speech. And he expressed sympathy for the motivations of his staff. \u201cNow, somebody did it because they thought I didn\u2019t like him, O.K.?\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters. \u201cThey were well meaning, I will say. I didn\u2019t know anything about it. I would never have done that.\u201d \u201cSo, I wasn\u2019t a fan of John McCain \u2014 I never will be,\u201d he added. \u201cBut certainly, I couldn\u2019t care less whether or not there\u2019s a boat named after his father.\u201d Mr. Trump repeated his reasons for why he disliked Mr. McCain. \u201cJohn McCain killed health care for the Republican Party, and he killed health care for the nation,\u201d Mr. Trump said, a reference to the late senator\u2019s critical vote against the president\u2019s health care proposal in July 2017. Critics faulted Mr. Trump for what they said was a petty war of words against Mr. McCain, who died last year of brain cancer. They also derided him for what they said were his attempts to divide the military. \u201cWe have a long history of keeping our military apolitical,\u201d said Representative Elissa Slotkin, a Michigan Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee who is a former Pentagon official. \u201cThe president\u2019s team felt it was appropriate to politicize this event.\u201d The email from the White House urging the Navy to move the McCain or make sure it was out of sight put officials in a difficult position. The McCain is still undergoing repairs, and moving it from its berth would be tremendously difficult, time consuming and set back the repair schedule. Navy officials struggled to explain why a tarp was hung over the ship\u2019s name, and later, where the president was scheduled to visit. The tarp, they said, was part of efforts to repair the hull; the barge was a painting barge. But other officials offered a different account. They said the initial decisions were made by midlevel officers in Japan, working with the White House advance team. The tarp and barge were removed after more senior Navy officials, in Japan and at the Indo-Pacific Command headquarters in Hawaii, thought better of complying with the White House request. There were similar questions about the status of the sailors. Two ships at the base did not participate in the president\u2019s visit: the McCain and the Stethem. Their sailors were given 96-hour weekend liberty for Memorial Day. Sailors from the other ships did not get the long liberty. Officials claimed there was not room for all of the sailors to hear Mr. Trump on the Wasp, an amphibious assault vessel. But they did not explain why the McCain and Stethem were excluded, arguing only that ships were selected to have a broad representation of the sailors on the base. The Navy said that if any sailors were turned away from the Wasp, it was because the space on that ship was scarce. Defenders of Mr. Trump said it was hard to imagine that he would penalize sailors because of his feelings for Mr. McCain. \u201cI expect he would see the sailors on the ship and want to talk to them,\u201d Mr. Keane said, \u201cand deflect the fact that the ship is named after Senator McCain.\u201d But other former military officers were withering in their condemnation of the White House and of the Navy\u2019s role. Barry R. McCaffrey, a retired Army general who served in the Clinton administration, said on Twitter that if Mr. Shanahan knew about the White House\u2019s order, he should resign. Democrats vying to challenge Mr. Trump in 2020 lost no time in seizing on the episode. \u201cJohn McCain was a war hero, should be treated as a war hero \u2014 anything less than that is beneath anyone who doesn\u2019t treat him that way,\u201d Mr. Biden said to reporters in Delaware. Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., and a veteran of the war in Afghanistan, said: \u201cThis is not a show. Our military is not a prop. Ships and sailors are not to be toyed with for the benefit of a fragile president\u2019s ego.\u201d",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Missteps? This White House has made a few. But apologies? Almost never. White House officials reiterated their position on Monday that a morbid joke an  aide made about John McCain \u2014 an 81-year-old, six-term Republican senator with brain cancer \u2014 is not the sort of thing that warrants an apology on behalf of this administration. This decision led colleagues and relatives of Mr. McCain to wonder what sort of situation would. It has also drawn consternation from some Republicans, who are waiting for more lawmakers to back up their colleague and demand an apology from the White House. So far, they\u2019ve heard little. \u201cSenator McCain is an American hero who has given his life to public service,\u201d Mike Steel, a Republican strategist, said in an interview. \u201cThis would\u2019ve been a one-day story if there had been an apology at the end of last week.\u201d Slowly, several of Mr. McCain\u2019s fellow Senate Republicans \u2014 including Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, John Cornyn of Texas, John Kennedy of Louisiana and Dan Sullivan of Alaska \u2014 began to call for an apology. But relenting to others\u2019 critiques is not the way of the Trump White House. And it is certainly not the way of President Trump. As pugilistic a president as he was a candidate, Mr. Trump\u2019s apologies are rare. \u201cThe president has always throughout his career had a stance of \u2018never apologize, never back down,\u2019\u201d Kevin Madden, a Republican strategist, said in an interview. Aides are \u201cmore likely to face the wrath internally\u201d from the president for admitting a misstep than they are \u201cfighting the media\u2019s instincts,\u201d he added. This combative ethos has stood firm amid an assortment of insults and missteps. Mr. Trump and his top aides did not apologize for his disparaging remarks about Haiti and countries in Africa. He mended fences with \u2014 but stopped short of a direct apology to \u2014 Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain after retweeting anti-Muslim videos posted by an ultranationalist British group. And his remarks last year that there were \u201cvery fine people on both sides\u201d of a white supremacist rally that left one woman dead in Charlottesville, Va., prompted sustained criticism from Congress and many fellow Republicans, but no apology from Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump had also refused to apologize for disparaging remarks he made about Mr. McCain on the campaign trail in 2015: \u201cHe\u2019s not a war hero,\u201d Mr. Trump said of Mr. McCain, who was shot down during the Vietnam War and held prisoner for more than five years in Hanoi. \u201cHe\u2019s a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren\u2019t captured.\u201d Even the rare mea culpa seems to bear an asterisk. In 2016, about a month before the election, when comments Mr. Trump made about grabbing women during an \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d segment surfaced on tape and threatened to destroy his campaign, he quickly apologized in a short video statement. \u201cI\u2019ve never said I\u2019m a perfect person,\u201d his apology began. But by the end of the statement, he had returned to a more familiar message: \u201cLet\u2019s be honest,\u201d Mr. Trump concluded, \u201cwe\u2019re living in the real world. This is nothing more than a distraction from the important issues we\u2019re facing today.\u201d According to a senior White House official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal deliberations, this ethos is again behind the White House\u2019s lack of an apology over the remark made by Kelly Sadler, a special assistant to the president, in a meeting last week. In off-the-cuff comments that were quickly leaked to the news media, Ms. Sadler assessed Mr. McCain\u2019s opposition to Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee for C.I.A. director: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s dying anyway.\u201d Two other forces are driving the decision not to apologize, that official said: The first is that White House officials believe that the Obama administration apologized for the United States\u2019 behavior on the world stage too often. And the second is a pervasive feeling of frustration among aides who fear their every word will be leaked to the news media. (An impassioned plea made last week by Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, to keep internal discussions private was leaked to the website Axios by five aides within hours.) Anger over leaks starts with the president. \u201cThe so-called leaks coming out of the White House are a massive over exaggeration put out by the Fake News Media in order to make us look as bad as possible,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Twitter on Monday. \u201cWith that being said, leakers are traitors and cowards, and we will find out who they are!\u201d That anger trickles down. When he took to the podium to speak to reporters on Monday, Raj Shah, a deputy White House press secretary, reinforced the idea that the leaks coming from the White House were the main source of frustration internally, not the content of Ms. Sadler\u2019s remarks. \u201cIf you aren\u2019t able, in internal meetings, to speak your mind or convey thoughts or say anything that you feel without feeling like your colleagues will betray you,\u201d Mr. Shah said, \u201cthat creates a very difficult work environment. I think anybody who works anywhere can recognize that.\u201d Mr. Shah added that he understood \u201cthe focus on this issue,\u201d but declined to offer specifics that Ms. Sadler\u2019s remarks were being \u201caddressed internally.\u201d Ms. Sadler, who works in the communications office and focuses on immigration, is still at work and is sending emails to the staff as usual, according to a White House official. One of the administration\u2019s few acknowledgments of a misstep came from Mr. Shah, who made headlines in February for saying during a news briefing that the White House could have better handled the episode surrounding Rob Porter, the former White House staff secretary who faced accounts of abuse from two former wives. Officials at the time released several conflicting timelines of the situation, including which officials knew about the accusations against him and when. The episode renewed scrutiny of how the Trump administration vets its officials. \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say we all could have done better\u201d in dealing with the situation, Mr. Shah told reporters at the time. The president, as usual, was watching the briefing that day. Mr. Trump was incensed by Mr. Shah\u2019s admission, according to a White House official, and told him not to do it again. On Monday, Mr. Shah declined to say whether the White House would make it clear that remarks such as Ms. Sadler\u2019s would not be tolerated in the administration. Instead, he reiterated that Ms. Sadler\u2019s comments constituted an \u201cinternal matter.\u201d Mr. Steel, the Republican strategist, said the White House was clearly ready \u201cto take the political hit\u201d for not backing up Mr. McCain, who has not been a consistent supporter of the administration\u2019s policies. \u201cThey are picking the wrong cross to die on in this case,\u201d Mr. Steel said. Mr. Shah\u2019s reaction to the situation surrounding Mr. McCain stood in contrast to how he answered questions from reporters who pointed out racially charged statements made by two men involved in the United States Embassy\u2019s opening in Jerusalem on Monday. On this matter, at least, the deputy press secretary made the president\u2019s stance clear. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen those remarks,\u201d Mr. Shah said quickly. \u201cBut obviously those aren\u2019t remarks that the president agrees with.\u201d",

For President Trump, it was Saturday.By Katie RogersPRINT EDITIONA Day of Mourning for Washington, a Day of Golf and Sour Tweets for Trump|September 2, 2018, Page A16",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 For the clusters of onlookers, besuited power players and three former presidents who had all traveled to Washington National Cathedral, the muggy day was a historic opportunity to memorialize the life of Senator John McCain, who was remembered as a deeply patriotic war hero, a former Republican presidential candidate and a scrappy, humanly flawed, ultimately idealistic lawmaker. For President Trump, it was Saturday. In the many discussions about how to mark his life that Mr. McCain had with his staff and family before he died, he had made clear he did not want Mr. Trump to participate in anything they planned. So as Mr. McCain was eulogized in the presence of much of the American political establishment, Mr. Trump, pointedly uninvited, engaged in what by now is a familiar weekend routine. He sent a series of angry tweets aimed at some political adversaries, then left the White House to play a round of golf at his resort in Virginia. \u201cThis is the scandal here \u2014 a police state,\u201d the president wrote, quoting a conservative commentator about a purported conspiracy to spy on Mr. Trump, as Mr. McCain\u2019s coffin was carried into the cathedral. He dredged up the investigation into his campaign\u2019s ties to Russia and complained about it. In a series of tweets, he argued that \u201cthe DOJ and FBI are completely out to lunch.\u201d And some of the president\u2019s supporters, aware of four days of funeral proceedings but seemingly emboldened by Mr. Trump\u2019s approach, chimed in with their own criticisms of how people were honoring Mr. McCain. \u201c@realDonaldTrump ran for @POTUS ONE time and WON,\u201d Katrina Pierson, an adviser on Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, tweeted. \u201cSome people will never recover from that.\u201d Throughout the morning, the three-mile distance between the White House and the cathedral, the traditional place for Washington\u2019s most somber gatherings, demarcated a political chasm that Mr. Trump did not cross. While Mr. McCain\u2019s closest friends insisted that the senator did not harbor a personal grudge toward the president, Mr. Trump\u2019s opinion of Mr. McCain has been more explicit. In recent months, as Mr. McCain was dying of cancer, the president\u2019s references were often barbed, and at his political rallies he would mimic the thumbs-down signal the senator had made when he voted against repealing the Affordable Care Act. When he recently signed a defense bill named in the senator\u2019s honor, the president refused to utter his name. Nor did Mr. Trump join leaders from both parties last Friday in sending sympathy to Mr. McCain and his family after it was announced that he was stopping treatment for his cancer. He died a day later. But while he was urged by his aides to behave in a more unifying manner after the White House was criticized for initially flying the American flag only briefly at half-staff in Mr. McCain\u2019s honor, the president made it clear on Saturday that he had no intention of letting his former adversary \u2014 whose carefully stage-managed plans played out as his own subtle rebuke of the president \u2014 have all the attention. As journalists lined up on the lawn at the cathedral \u2014 members of a group Mr. McCain used to jokingly call \u201cmy base\u201d \u2014 Mr. Trump tweeted out his well-known disdain for the news media. Mr. Trump cited Alan Dershowitz, the emeritus Harvard Law School professor, saying that \u201cnews reporting has become part of the adversary system.\u201d Mr. Trump added: \u201cIt has become tainted and corrupt!\u201d Throughout the week, the president declined to comment on any of the public events marking Mr. McCain\u2019s death, and he said publicly that he thought he had done enough to honor the Arizona senator. Advisers said he was not willing to cancel any of his plans \u2014 including a raucous rally in Indiana held on Thursday, just as Mr. McCain\u2019s coffin was being transported to Washington. The only change in plans he made was canceling a weekend visit to Camp David in the Maryland mountains, which would have put him even farther from Mr. McCain\u2019s funeral. Instead, upstaged by a senator whose final acts were defined by his calls for bipartisan unity amid a climate of coarsening politics, Mr. Trump stayed in Washington and spent the first day of a holiday weekend saying and doing what he usually does. Not all the members of the Trump administration followed his lead. Several took a more somber approach as they mingled with the grieving inhabitants of official Washington. Earlier in the morning, as Cindy McCain, Mr. McCain\u2019s widow, stood in front of a wreath honoring her husband at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, Mr. Trump\u2019s chief of staff, John F. Kelly, and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis somberly stood by her side. Most notably, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s daughter and son-in-law, along with John R. Bolton, Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser, entered the cathedral just as the hearse carrying Mr. McCain arrived. As the church\u2019s bells played a rendition of \u201cAmerica the Beautiful,\u201d Mr. Trump shared a favorable review of his administration on Twitter. Ms. Trump was asked to attend earlier in the week by Senator Lindsey Graham, a close friend of Mr. McCain\u2019s who had cleared his invitation with the senator\u2019s widow, according to a White House official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Mr. Graham invited Ms. Trump after she expressed her condolences to him during a meeting on Capitol Hill this week. Her father continued to tweet during the service, switching his focus to Canada and the North American Free Trade Agreement, threatening to exclude Canada from a final deal and insisting that he saw no political need to accommodate the Canadians. Mr. Trump also warned Congress, which has final say over trade deals, not to interfere and said that he would be happy to just terminate Nafta altogether. It remains a matter of debate as to whether Mr. Trump has the authority to do that on his own. As Mr. Trump tweeted, onlookers outside the cathedral lined up along the streets, and pointed through the wrought-iron fences. They identified the politicians streaming in, lifting their children on their shoulders for a better look. And several took note of a difference they saw between Mr. Trump\u2019s unpredictable approach to politics and the senator who stayed steadfast to his ideals. \u201cHe\u2019s almost a thing of the past,\u201d said Boyd Lewis, 61, a Democrat from Washington, as he anchored his dog leash on the fence and peered up to the cathedral doors. \u201cToday, the lack of civility, lack of integrity coming out of the White House \u2014 McCain was a great soul, not a baseless demigod.\u201d Inside the cathedral, it was Meghan McCain, the senator\u2019s daughter, who made the contrast most explicit. As she approached the dais, the first speaker in the service, Ms. McCain delivered a pointed condemnation of Mr. Trump\u2019s policies, seizing on his campaign slogan, \u201cMake America Great Again,\u201d in her emotional eulogy. \u201cThe America of John McCain has no need to be made great again,\u201d Ms. McCain, who has frequently delivered raw rebukes of Trump-era politics in recent months, said as applause rang out in the cathedral, \u201cbecause America was always great.\u201d",

But with his own seat on the line and Arizona Hispanics at odds with Donald Trump, it\u2019s a risky position.By Jennifer SteinhauerPRINT EDITIONGritting Teeth, McCain Links Fate to Trump|June 5, 2016, Page A1",
      "author": "Jennifer Steinhauer",
      "content": " TUCSON, Ariz. \u2014 Senator John McCain does not say much these days about Donald J. Trump\u2019s attack on his five-plus years as a prisoner of war. Instead, he clenches his teeth and says he will support the Republican Party\u2019s presumptive nominee, who once said derisively about the senator\u2019s time in captivity, \u201cI like people that weren\u2019t captured.\u201d In the triple-digit swelter here in Arizona, his home state, Mr. McCain, who was the Republicans\u2019 presidential nominee and standard-bearer in 2008, did not openly bemoan this moment from his long political life. He is focusing on what he considers his toughest re-election fight yet, and is betting that the only way to keep his seat is to support Mr. Trump. \u201cI\u2019m fair game. I\u2019m in the arena,\u201d said Mr. McCain, 79, whose thinning face reflects the decades he has spent traveling around his massive and increasingly diverse state. Still, the episode sits with traces of bitterness, like old coffee grounds at the bottom of his cup, even if he says otherwise. For a moment, the July attack on Mr. McCain seemed to be Mr. Trump\u2019s undoing. McCain said he recalled a recent chat with a World War II veteran who had been in a German prison camp. As he delivered the man a missing medal, \u201che said to me, \u2018Why would Trump say something like that about us?\u2019 \u201d the senator said. \u201cFrankly, I didn\u2019t have an answer for it.\u201d But Mr. Trump has since called for mass deportations of illegal immigrants and a wall at the Mexican border, and now the billionaire businessman could be the force that ultimately topples the indomitable Mr. McCain. An estimated 433,000 Hispanics are expected to vote in Arizona this November, an 8 percent increase from 2012. And Mr. McCain has a credible Democratic challenger, Representative Ann Kirkpatrick, who grew up on an Indian reservation and has strong support from the state\u2019s sizable Native American population. \u201cI just came from a Latino round table, and they are really concerned about McCain\u2019s support for Trump,\u201d she said Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s very personal here.\u201d She is working with the state\u2019s Democrats to harness these forces against Mr. McCain and his old guard, which is largely behind Mr. Trump. Ms. Kirkpatrick said that being anti-Trump \u201cis a strong message,\u201d but she acknowledged that \u201cit\u2019s not the only message.\u201d She recently opened a field office in Tempe, and has many Arizona State University volunteers working the phones. Working out of an old bank, aides sit in the former vault (the door has been removed) to go over Mr. McCain\u2019s statements, year by year, and look for inconsistencies that suggest too long a stay in Congress. \u201cThe race comes down to whether Arizonans take a step back and judge John McCain for being John McCain and his remarkable life of public service,\u201d said Grant Woods, a former state attorney general and the senator\u2019s friend for decades. \u201cAnd not as being a long-term incumbent, and not as a Republican in a year when the party has a controversial nominee. If they do that, he will win walking away. If they don\u2019t, then it could be tight. Could he lose? Yeah.\u201d Despite the personal attacks by Mr. Trump on the senator\u2019s integrity and war record, Mr. McCain cannot afford to reject Mr. Trump and alienate his many supporters in Arizona if he hopes to hold his seat, an agonizing trade-off. Mr. McCain is the embodiment of much that voters in both parties, but especially fans of Mr. Trump, have said they would like to jettison this year. He is the ultimate establishment player, having served in Congress for nearly four decades \u2014 five terms in the Senate alone. \u201cBack in the Middle Ages, I was known as the maverick,\u201d Mr. McCain said, smiling wanly. He is an unapologetic free trader, an interventionist abroad who continues to defend the deeply unpopular war in Iraq, a supporter of private industry and markets, and the original, if inconstant, champion of changes to the immigration system that would help some illegal immigrants become citizens. To succeed in what most people believe will be his last political campaign, Mr. McCain must canter around the state assuring Mr. Trump\u2019s detractors that he does not share the businessman\u2019s visions for mass deportation and the dissolution of NATO, while continuing to woo an angry Republican base that overwhelmingly voted for Mr. Trump in the state\u2019s March primary. \u201cI\u2019ve been feeling it out there for some time,\u201d Mr. McCain said. \u201cIn the southern part of the state here, they are not feeling the recovery at all. Then there is this whole issue with these young people and kids carrying around all this debt.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s the Bernie effect,\u201d he said, referring to Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019s youth appeal in the Democratic primaries. He added: \u201cThe turmoil in this race is more than I\u2019ve ever seen. Younger, newer voters are registering for only one reason, to vote against Trump. So my challenge is to convince that younger, newer voter that I am for them.\u201d His greater challenge may be with Latinos angry at Mr. Trump. According to an analysis of voter and census data by the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials Educational Fund, Latinos are expected to account for 17 percent of Arizona\u2019s registered electorate this year, with a voter turnout rate at close to 70 percent. Nearly 45 percent of Latino registered voters are Democrats, the report found. \u201cI\u2019ve always spent a lot of time with the Hispanic community,\u201d Mr. McCain said, \u201cbut having said that, they are rising in numbers in the voting population. I\u2019m putting more emphasis there, particularly in light of Trump\u2019s comments.\u201d Hispanics in the Phoenix area will also be heavily motivated to vote in the sheriff\u2019s election; Joe Arpaio, a Trump supporter who was recently found in contempt of court for willfully violating an order requiring his deputies to stop detaining Latinos, will be on the ballot, trying to keep his seat as Maricopa County sheriff. A day watching Mr. McCain campaign here this past week reflects his evolving challenges. He sat for the endorsement of a small group of Border Patrol agents, who have also endorsed Mr. Trump, and listened in silence as Art Del Cueto, the president of Tucson Local 2455 of the National Border Patrol Council, explained why Mr. Trump had gotten their approval. \u201cIt means so much to me this long relationship we\u2019ve had,\u201d Mr. McCain said about his endorsement, \u201cand the support we\u2019ve tried to provide. \u201d Mr. Del Cueto did say that \u201cwe did talk to Donald\u201d about his comments concerning Mr. McCain\u2019s war record. \u201cI don\u2019t think it was a comment that has been made again,\u201d he said. But a bit later, meeting with Hispanic business leaders, Mr. McCain opened with \u201cWe\u2019re going to make America great again and it\u2019s going to be huge, O.K.?\u201d It was a tiny swipe at Mr. Trump, taken in the manner of a toddler grabbing a cookie when he assumes no one is looking. Then it was on to other topics, like the Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization. Mr. McCain remains most at home with other veterans, like the one he visited \u2014 on Memorial Day, another man waiting on medals. \u201cHis wife said he was staying alive to get those medals,\u201d Mr. McCain said, smiling at the memory. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s a nice job.\u201d",

      "author": "Lizette Alvarez",
      "content": " MIAMI \u2014 Senators Marco Rubio of Florida and John McCain of Arizona brushed off primary challenges on Tuesday from Republican contenders. Mr. Rubio will face a general-election race against Representative Patrick Murphy, a two-term Democrat, in a crucial contest for control of the Senate. Mr. McCain, seeking a sixth term, could also face a serious challenge, from Representative Ann Kirkpatrick, who has made it a point of her campaign to court Latinos and American Indians in an increasingly diverse and competitive state. The contest between Mr. Rubio and Mr. Murphy is likely to be among the most expensive Senate contests in the country. With his onetime rival Donald J. Trump at the top of the Republican presidential ticket, Mr. Rubio, 45, will seek to fend off Mr. Murphy, 33, who has faced recent accusations of r\u00e9sum\u00e9 padding. They were not the only recognizable names to win races on Tuesday and move on to the Nov. 8 general election. Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the embattled former Democratic National Committee chairwoman, won her South Florida battle against a lesser-known law professor who was endorsed by Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. The primary results appeared to point to a preference among voters in Florida, a pivotal swing state, to eschew more extreme candidates on the right and the left in favor of establishment lawmakers favored by national party leaders. Mr. McCain, 80, of Arizona faced a challenge from his right from Kelli Ward, a family doctor and a former state senator. In Florida, Mr. Rubio, who was asked by Republican leaders to enter the Senate race after saying he would not seek re-election, defeated Carlos Beruff, a wealthy Cuban-American gulf coast homebuilder. Mr. Beruff, who spent $8 million of his money on his bid, is an avid supporter of Mr. Trump. Mr. Rubio\u2019s Democratic opponent, Mr. Murphy, bested Representative Alan Grayson, a liberal provocateur who was favored by many progressives but faced ethics inquiries in the House and accusations that he had abused his former wife. \u201cI commit to you that I will serve my full term,\u201d Mr. Murphy told supporters Tuesday night, suggesting that Mr. Rubio would run for president again instead. Earlier Tuesday, in an interview on CNN, Mr. Rubio had been reluctant to commit to a full term, saying, \u201cNo one can make that commitment because you don\u2019t know what the future\u2019s going to hold in your life personally or politically.\u201d In a victory speech on Tuesday night, Mr. Rubio pointed out that Mr. Murphy, whose father is a millionaire, grew up wealthy, a sharp contrast to Mr. Rubio\u2019s humble upbringing. Mr. Rubio added that he had no intention to deliver a \u201crubber stamp,\u201d no matter who was elected president in November. Florida voters were asked to cast ballots for an unusually high number of contested congressional primaries, the result of a court-ordered redistricting map that changed 24 of the state\u2019s 27 districts. One tough fight on Tuesday was the Democratic primary in Miami\u2019s 26th Congressional District, where former Representative Joe Garcia defeated Annette Taddeo, who was selected by former Gov. Charlie Crist to be his running mate in his failed 2014 bid to recapture the governor\u2019s office. Mr. Garcia had faced criticism over fraudulent absentee ballots in 2012, but was never charged with wrongdoing. One of his former staff members pleaded guilty and served jail time. Mr. Garcia will face a one-term incumbent, Representative Carlos Curbelo, whose seat is threatened by the new redistricting map, which made the district less hospitable to Republicans. Mr. Curbelo won the seat from Mr. Garcia in 2014. Farther north in Florida, Representative Corrine Brown, a House stalwart who more than 20 years ago became one of the first African-Americans elected to Congress from Florida, lost her seat to Al Lawson, a former state senator. Ms. Brown and her chief of staff were indicted in July on federal charges of conspiracy and fraud. But Ms. Brown\u2019s re-election troubles predated her indictment. Her district was changed significantly, making it harder for a Democrat to win.",

      "author": "Jonathan Martin",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Gov. Doug Ducey of Arizona on Tuesday appointed Representative Martha McSally to the Senate seat previously held by John McCain, bowing to the preferences of Washington Republicans despite his own misgivings about Ms. McSally\u2019s lackluster Senate campaign this year. Mr. Ducey, who easily won re-election last month as Ms. McSally was defeated in her bid for Arizona\u2019s other Senate seat, hailed her combat service as an Air Force pilot and two terms in the House. \u201cWith her experience and long record of service, Martha is uniquely qualified to step up and fight for Arizona\u2019s interests in the U.S. Senate,\u201d Mr. Ducey said in a statement. Ms. McSally will enter the Senate at the start of the year, replacing Senator Jon Kyl, the senator-turned-lobbyist who returned to the chamber as a caretaker in the months immediately following Mr. McCain\u2019s death in August. Mr. Kyl announced last week he would resign at the end of the year. In an unusual twist, Ms. McSally will be paired in the Senate with the woman who just beat her, Kyrsten Sinema. It was Ms. McSally\u2019s performance in that campaign, which she lost by just over two points after struggling to appeal to moderate voters, that gave Mr. Ducey and his advisers pause about appointing her, according to Republicans familiar with their thinking. But the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, advocated for Ms. McSally, and the governor recognized that she alone had the sort of fund-raising base and statewide name recognition that will be pivotal in 2020, when she will have to run again to serve out Mr. McCain\u2019s unexpired term. \u201cI look forward to working closely with Kyrsten Sinema in the Senate, as we did in the House,\u201d Ms. McSally said at a news conference with Mr. Ducey, glossing over a fiercely fought campaign in which, at one point, she accused the Democrat of treason. To receive the appointment, though, Ms. McSally, a Tucson-area lawmaker, was encouraged by the governor to make amends with the McCain family. Ms. McSally, who distanced herself from Mr. McCain during the Republican primary this year, visited the late senator\u2019s widow, Cindy, on Friday in Phoenix. The meeting went well enough that an individual close to the family said afterward that Mrs. McCain would not oppose the appointment. But on Tuesday she offered more advice for Ms. McSally and praise for Mr. Ducey than she did enthusiasm about his selection. \u201cMy husband\u2019s greatest legacy was placing service to AZ & USA ahead of his own self-interest,\u201d Mrs. McCain wrote on Twitter. \u201cI respect @dougducey\u2019s decision to appoint @RepMcSally to fill the remainder of his term. Arizonans will be pulling for her, hoping that she will follow his example of selfless leadership.\u201d The only other candidate Mr. Ducey seriously considered was Kirk Adams, his just-departed chief of staff. But the governor was uneasy about elevating his own aide, who also served in the State Legislature, and thought Ms. McSally would have an easier time navigating the 2020 primary and general election. In some ways, Ms. McSally\u2019s appointment was anti-climactic. When Mr. Kyl took the post in September, he committed to serving only through the end of this year \u2014 establishing the seat as something of an insurance policy for Ms. McSally in case she lost to Ms. Sinema. Democrats wasted little time Tuesday highlighting the turn of events that led to Senate opponents becoming Senate colleagues in less than two months. \u201cWhy appoint a loser when you could find a fresh face with a better shot in 2020?\u201d asked Lauren Passalacqua, spokeswoman for the Senate Democratic campaign arm, adding of Ms. McSally: \u201cVoters rejected her once, and will do so again.\u201d But the same internecine feuding that plagued Republicans this year, and forced Ms. McSally to move to the right to secure the nomination, could also hamper Democrats in two years. Grant Woods, a former Arizona attorney general and close McCain family friend \u2014 and a former Republican \u2014 is considering seeking the Democratic nomination for the seat. And if he does, he will almost certainly face a stiff primary challenge from the progressive wing of the party. Representative Ruben Gallego, a Marine veteran and Phoenix-area lawmaker, has made little secret of his desire to run statewide. And Representative-elect Greg Stanton, the former Phoenix mayor, may also consider a bid.",

      "author": "Sheryl Gay Stolberg",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 \u201cI always do whatever Lindsey Graham tells me to do,\u201d Senator John McCain, the unpredictable Arizona Republican, said last week, while entertaining questions from a scrum of reporters in a Capitol hallway. He was referring to his best Senate friend and frequent travel partner, Senator Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina Republican who is so closely identified with Mr. McCain that when he arrived in the Senate after serving in the House, he was called \u201cMcCain\u2019s mini-me.\u201d But now the McCain-Graham bond is being tested. At issue is how Mr. McCain will vote on a health care measure that bears Mr. Graham\u2019s name: the so-called Graham-Cassidy bill, which would dismantle the Affordable Care Act by taking money spent under the law and sending it to states in the form of block grants. The measure, sponsored by Mr. Graham and Senator Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana, is a last-ditch effort by Republicans to fulfill their seven-year-old promise to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Supporters say it is gaining traction in the Senate, but it remains a few votes shy of passage. Under the bill, millions could lose coverage, Medicaid would see the same magnitude of cuts that earlier repeal bills extracted, and insurers in some states could charge higher premiums to people with pre-existing conditions. The Senate Republican leadership has been taking the pulse of its caucus, trying to determine whether it can muster enough votes. A clock is ticking. If the Senate does not vote by the end of next week, it will become nearly impossible to repeal the Affordable Care Act. The drive to kill the bill will lose the procedural protections that allow it to pass the Senate with a simple majority, rather than the 60 votes that would otherwise be needed to overcome a filibuster. The last time Republicans tried to repeal President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care law, Mr. McCain, who had just learned he had brain cancer, provided the dramatic thumbs-down vote that sank the so-called skinny repeal. For weeks, Mr. McCain has been coy about his intentions \u2014 and he was again on Monday afternoon. He has said repeatedly that he is open to the Graham-Cassidy measure and that he would be more inclined to vote for it if Arizona\u2019s Republican governor, Doug Ducey, supported it. \u201cI am all in favor of giving the governors much more control over what happens in their states,\u201d Mr. McCain said during the recent hallway conversation. On Monday, Mr. Ducey gave the measure\u2019s chances a boost, tweeting that he supports the Graham-Cassidy proposal as \u201cthe best path forward to repeal and replace Obamacare.\u201d But that was not enough for Mr. McCain, who told reporters he was still making up his mind, in large part because he had lately been adamant that bills should go through what Congress calls \u201cregular order\u201d \u2014 meaning the committee process. \u201cThe governor came out in favor, which obviously has some impact, but the fact is we have also not gone through the regular order,\u201d Mr. McCain said on Monday, saying that Republicans had had nine months to come up with a workable piece of legislation, and had failed to do so. He said that he had spoken with Mr. Graham about the measure, but that Mr. Graham had not pressed him on it. \u201cWe don\u2019t press each other,\u201d Mr. McCain said. \u201cHe has made clear what he thinks is important to get passed.\u201d Mr. Graham and Mr. McCain are frequent travel companions; not long ago, shortly after Mr. McCain completed chemotherapy treatment for his cancer, they attended the international economics conference known as the Ambrosetti Forum in Italy. In an interview after they returned, Mr. Graham said he had been having difficulty adjusting to Mr. McCain\u2019s diagnosis. \u201cNobody saw this coming; at least I didn\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Graham said. \u201cIt hit me hard. I can\u2019t think of anything I\u2019ve done of consequence, politically, that hasn\u2019t been with John.\u201d",

      "author": "Katie Rogers",
      "content": " EVANSVILLE, Ind. \u2014 As Senator John McCain\u2019s coffin was being loaded onto a military plane bound for Washington on Thursday afternoon, cameras from major American TV networks beamed the coverage around the world, allowing a rapt public to witness the next leg of his four-day funeral. Back at the White House, President Trump aggressively tried to wrestle back the attention. \u201cThrowback Thursday!\u201d the president exclaimed on Twitter, posting a video of celebratory Fox News clips of his unlikely route to the presidency just as Mr. McCain\u2019s coffin was heading for Washington, where it will lie in state in the United States Capitol on Friday. As the day unfolded, Mr. Trump\u2019s behavior continued to offer a split-screen effect that has persisted since Mr. McCain died at 81 from brain cancer on Saturday. This week, Mr. Trump has once again made clear that his usual media blitzing does not slow for anyone, and he has barreled forward to showcase the new and politically tribal reality that he has promised his supporters. Conspicuously absent from the president was any acknowledgment that a nation was remembering the contributions of Mr. McCain, a Republican war hero and two-time presidential candidate. Clues to how Mr. Trump might feel about having the attention diverted from him lay not in what he said \u2014 and on Thursday, he certainly had a lot to say \u2014 but in what he did not. Earlier in the day, as Joseph R. Biden Jr., the former vice president, gave an emotional eulogy to Mr. McCain in Arizona, Mr. Trump, who months ago had been excluded from any of Mr. McCain\u2019s memorial ceremonies, tweeted about witch hunts and fake news. He sat for an interview with Bloomberg, in which he dangled the prospect of keeping Attorney General Jeff Sessions, an early believer turned political pi\u00f1ata, in his job until November. \u201cI just would love to have him do a great job,\u201d the president said. In the interview, he was defiant about how he handled the senator\u2019s death: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think I have at all,\u201d Mr. Trump said when asked whether he had missed a chance to unite the country. \u201cI\u2019ve done everything that they requested,\u201d he said, referring to his decision to let Mr. McCain\u2019s family have the military transport the senator\u2019s remains from Arizona to Washington, and to have service members as pallbearers at his funeral. Mr. Trump also appeared to mock Sarah Huckabee Sanders, his press secretary and one of the aides who pushed him to issue an official response to Mr. McCain\u2019s death days earlier than he did. When he declined to indicate whether Mr. McCain would have made a better president than Barack Obama, Mr. Trump dangled his lack of response over Ms. Sanders, saying that she must be \u201chaving a nervous breakdown.\u201d As he nursed his perceived wounds, Mr. Trump dispatched the vice president to Minnesota to smooth over any tension with members of the American Legion, a wartime veterans service organization. That group expressed alarm at Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to return the White House flag to full staff two days after Mr. McCain\u2019s death, and was said to have been a factor in the decision to lower the flag back down through Mr. McCain\u2019s interment. Vice President Mike Pence told attendees at the group\u2019s national convention that \u201cAmerica will always remember and honor the lifetime of service of United States Senator John McCain.\u201d After the attack-and-court-Washington-news-media portion of his day, Mr. Trump flew to this town in southern Indiana to attend one of his beloved political rallies, where he stumped for Mike Braun, a former state representative running for Senate. Mr. Braun will challenge Senator Joe Donnelly, one of the most vulnerable incumbents in the chamber, and spent most of his time at the rally lavishing praise on the president. Since the campaign, the rallies have offered Mr. Trump instant gratification, reassurance and, perhaps most important, an opportunity to wrest back control of a narrative he has felt strayed too far away from him. He was particularly happy to get to Evansville this week, several people close to the president said. They said Mr. Trump, an avid follower of news headlines, was behaving as if he had been cornered, and was lashing out at the negative coverage of his administration. By the time Mr. Trump opened the rally, he made it clear his mood had changed from defiant to rally-energized, delivering classic red-meat fare for his supporters. The event followed the usual recipe: First, the president identified the city he was visiting. He thanked the \u201cspecial\u201d people of Evansville and Indiana, who greeted him with a \u201cU.S.A.\u201d chant. Mr. Trump then added his economic accomplishments to the mix. This time, he expressed optimism for a revised trade deal with Canada, skimming over the trade talks with Mexico \u2014 a country he often jeers at these events \u2014 that took place this week. \u201cIt could happen,\u201d Mr. Trump said of the negotiations. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens. If it doesn\u2019t happen, we\u2019ll put tariffs on the cars coming in from Canada and it\u2019ll be even better.\u201d Then, Mr. Trump paused as the crowd booed a protester. \u201cWhere the hell did she come from?\u201d he asked. (A photographer with The Associated Press captured a volunteer member of the president\u2019s advance team blocking another photographer from taking a picture of the protester.) After the demonstrator was ejected, Mr. Trump pulled out his most reliable heels: journalists and Democrats. He started a screed about the news media, which he castigated for reporting, among other pieces he found unflattering, that he was concerned that a rally in West Virginia last week was less enthusiastic than usual. He spent several minutes complaining that the coverage of a rally did not sufficiently capture the enthusiasm of his supporters, and repeatedly returned to the topic. The president reserved some ire for Mr. Donnelly and the usual conga line of Democratic targets including Senator Chuck Schumer, Representatives Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters, and Hillary Clinton \u2014 \u201cLock her up!\u201d the crowd chanted. The Democratic Party, he added, had been taken captive by \u201cdeep-state radicals\u201d and \u201cfake-news allies.\u201d Mr. Donnelly, for his part, did not take the bait. \u201cI was unable to watch President Trump\u2019s rally tonight, as I was headed back to Washington for Senator McCain\u2019s memorial services,\u201d he said in a pointed statement. Mr. Trump \u2014 who at one point told the audience, \u201cOur veterans are the greatest\u201d \u2014 made no mention of Mr. McCain. The crowd did not seem to mind. Outside the rally, a line of the president\u2019s supporters wearing T-shirts and waving Trump flags snaked around several downtown blocks, cheering and contributing to a festive atmosphere. But nearby, members of a group who had gathered to protest Mr. Trump\u2019s policies said they were upset and angered by the president\u2019s behavior toward Mr. McCain. \u201cA person of McCain\u2019s caliber needed to be honored in his death,\u201d Lydia Johnson, a retired public relations executive, said as she stood in the hot sun. She said she did not agree with everything the Arizona senator believed. But, Ms. Johnson added, \u201cHe would say sorry when he realized he made a mistake.\u201d After the rally, Mr. Trump was immediately told by White House staff members that the event had broken attendance records, according to a person with knowledge of the exchange. He was accompanied by Corey Lewandowski and David Bossie, two trusted allies. The president, once again sated, flew back to Washington in high spirits.",

Oppel Jr.PRINT EDITIONLawyer Objects to Comments From McCain on Bergdahl|October 13, 2015, Page A13",
      "author": "Richard A. Oppel Jr.",
      "content": " A day after the disclosure of an Army lawyer\u2019s recommendation that Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl face neither jail time nor punitive discharge for walking off his Army outpost in Afghanistan in 2009, Senator John McCain, chairman of the committee that oversees promotions of senior military commanders, said that Sergeant Bergdahl was \u201cclearly a deserter\u201d and that he would convene a hearing if the sergeant was not punished. Mr. McCain\u2019s statement drew a sharp rebuke on Monday from Sergeant Bergdahl\u2019s lawyer, partly because the four-star Army general who will ultimately decide the fate of Sergeant Bergdahl is considered likely someday to face a hearing for his next job before Mr. McCain\u2019s committee. Sergeant Bergdahl\u2019s lawyer, Eugene R. Fidell, accused Mr. McCain, Republican of Arizona, of improperly seeking to influence the outcome of a major military prosecution. Mr. McCain made the comments in an interview with  The Boston Herald on Sunday in Pelham, N.H., where he was campaigning on behalf of one of his top allies, Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination. \u201cIf it comes out that he has no punishment, we\u2019re going to have to have a hearing in the Senate Armed Services Committee,\u201d the newspaper quoted Senator McCain as saying about Sergeant Bergdahl. \u201cAnd I am not prejudging, O.K., but it is well known that in the searches for Bergdahl, after \u2014 we know now \u2014 he deserted, there are allegations that some American soldiers were killed or wounded, or at the very least put their lives in danger, searching for what is clearly a deserter,\u201d Mr. McCain told The Herald. \u201cWe need to have a hearing on that.\u201d Under military rules, Gen. Robert B. Abrams, the commander of Army Forces Command at Fort Bragg, N.C., will ultimately decide what charges the sergeant will face. General Abrams, who also has the power to vacate any eventual conviction against Sergeant Bergdahl, is seen inside the military as someone likely to be nominated for other commands, which would require approval from Mr. McCain\u2019s committee. Mr. Fidell said in an interview on Monday that Senator McCain\u2019s comments in New Hampshire could influence how General Abrams and his advisers proceed and that the remarks might sway other people who could play a role in the case, including military jurors. \u201cSenator McCain\u2019s comments constitute unlawful congressional influence,\u201d Mr. Fidell said in a filing on Monday before the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces. The Army has charged Sergeant Bergdahl with endangering the troops ordered to search for him after he disappeared in June 2009 \u2014 a charge that could mean life imprisonment \u2014 and with a count of desertion that carries a five-year maximum sentence. Sergeant Bergdahl was released in May 2014 after President Obama approved a deal exchanging him for five Taliban detainees in Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba. In an emailed statement, Dustin Walker, a\u00a0spokesman for the Armed Services Committee, said the committee \u201cwill continue its longstanding oversight of the entire matter of Sergeant Bergdahl, not just his conduct, but also the administration policy that led to the release of five high-value Taliban detainees without congressional notification, as required by law.\u201d \u201cChairman McCain,\u201d the statement added, \u201cwants the legal proceedings to run their course before making a determination how best to continue the committee\u2019s oversight work.\u201d At a preliminary hearing last month in Texas, the Army\u2019s investigating officer, Maj. Gen. Kenneth Dahl, testified that jail time for Sergeant Bergdahl would be \u201cinappropriate\u201d and that the investigation had found no evidence to support claims that the sergeant had intended to defect to the Taliban or that any soldiers had been killed while specifically searching for him. General Dahl also testified that Sergeant Bergdahl had not intended to leave permanently, but that he had planned to hike 18 miles to a larger military base to inform a senior commander of what he believed were serious leadership problems in his unit. After that testimony, the independent Army lawyer who presided over the hearing, Lt. Col. Mark Visger, issued a recommendation that Sergeant Bergdahl face no jail time and no punitive discharge, according to Mr. Fidell. Army Forces Command officials have declined to comment on details of the case, saying they \u201ccontinue to maintain careful respect for the military-judicial process, the rights of the accused, and ensuring the case\u2019s fairness and impartiality.\u201d",

      "author": "Julie Hirschfeld Davis",
      "content": " Senator John McCain lay in state on Friday in the Capitol whose halls he prowled for decades, hailed as a war hero, a principled lawmaker, and a restless fighter for his beliefs \u2014 and honored with a ceremony reserved for the country\u2019s most revered figures. On a day when President Trump was conspicuously absent \u2014 by Mr. McCain\u2019s own design \u2014 the senator rested in an American flag-draped coffin under the Capitol dome, as the vice president, congressional leaders and prominent lawmakers past and present from both parties, military and cabinet officials and members of the public took turns participating in a bipartisan show of respect. The remembrances of Mr. McCain, whose death has underscored the demise of his particular brand of pragmatic and civil politics, served as a counterpoint to the discourse surrounding the sitting president, and a reminder of the Arizona senator\u2019s place in American history. \u201cHalf a world away, wearing our nation\u2019s uniform, John McCain stood up for every value that this Capitol building represents,\u201d said Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader. \u201cThen he brought that same patriotism inside its walls, to advocate for our servicemembers, our veterans, and our moral leadership in the world. So it is only right that today, near the end of his long journey, John lies here.\u201d The day\u2019s solemn events marked only the beginning of an elaborate celebration of Mr. McCain\u2019s life by official Washington, which will culminate on Saturday with a memorial service at the National Cathedral, where he will be eulogized by the two presidents who denied his own quests for the White House \u2014 Barack Obama and George W. Bush \u2014 in an event that is expected to draw a remarkable, bipartisan cast of characters. Mr. McCain meticulously planned the events with an eye toward drawing an implicit contrast with Mr. Trump. Mr. McCain was the 31st person and only the 13th senator to lie in state at the Capitol, his coffin atop the black crepe-draped catafalque that was constructed for Abraham Lincoln in 1865. In their remarks about the six-term senator, who won the Republican nomination for president in 2008, his former colleagues reflected on the significance of his life and what he meant to Americans. \u201cThough the highest office eluded him,\u201d said Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, \u201che attained what is far more enduring: the abiding affection of his fellow citizens, and an example for future generations.\u201d The proceedings began on a somber note. As Mr. McCain\u2019s coffin was removed from a black hearse by uniformed military pallbearers, a steady downpour began, soaking the Capitol steps as the senator was carried, slowly and silently, into the Rotunda with his family looking on. But the day was not all pomp and ceremony; thousands of people clogged the streets bordering the Capitol and formed lines snaking into the Visitor\u2019s Center, as members of the public waited for their chance to enter and pay respects to Mr. McCain. Mr. Trump, who remained at the White House during the ceremony, was nonetheless present as a constant metaphor. \u201cThe president asked me to be here on behalf of a grateful nation, to pay a debt of honor and respect to a man who served his country throughout his life,\u201d said Vice President Mike Pence, who had the awkward assignment of eulogizing a man whom the president openly mocked during life and has studiously avoided praising after his death. With Mr. McCain\u2019s grief-stricken daughter Meghan McCain looking on with an icy gaze, Mr. Pence mustered one positive quote from the commander in chief, referencing a remark Mr. Trump made on Thursday during an interview with Bloomberg. \u201cAs President Trump said yesterday,\u201d he offered, \u201cwe respect his service to the country.\u201d For his own part, Mr. Pence praised Mr. McCain for his \u201ciron will,\u201d and called him a \u201cpatriot,\u201d while alluding to the fact that they had many differences. \u201cIn my years in Congress and as vice president, we didn\u2019t always agree either, and he almost always noticed,\u201d Mr. Pence said. \u201cBut his support for limited government, for tax reform, and support for our armed forces surely made our nation more prosperous and more secure, and he will be missed.\u201d As they reflected on Mr. McCain\u2019s long years of service, his work ethic and his passion for public service, his former colleagues also uniformly recalled with rueful smiles his hot temper, counting dressings-down by the late senator as badges of honor. \u201cI myself, from time to time, found myself on the receiving end of John\u2019s distinct brand of candor \u2014 happily so,\u201d Mr. Ryan said. \u201cI remember thinking more than once, \u2018Yeah, he really does talk like a sailor.\u2019 \u201d \u201cWith John, it was never feigned disagreement,\u201d he added. \u201cThe man didn\u2019t feign anything \u2014 he just relished the fight.\u201d Mr. McConnell said he would often joke that Mr. McCain\u2019s captors in Vietnam, where he was held as a prisoner of war for five years, probably needed \u201cgroup therapy\u201d once Mr. McCain was finished with them \u2014 and that senators sometimes felt that they did as well. \u201cAt any moment, he might be preparing an eloquent reflection on human liberty, or a devastating joke, served up with his signature cackle and that John McCain glint in his eye,\u201d Mr. McConnell recalled. \u201cHe had America\u2019s fighting spirit \u2014 our noble idealism, our solemn patriotism, and our slightly irreverent streak \u2014 all rolled into one.\u201d Among the attendees at Friday\u2019s ceremony at the Rotunda was Roberta McCain, Mr. McCain\u2019s 106-year-old mother, who sat stoically gazing at the flag-draped coffin bearing the remains of the son she knew as \u201cJohnny.\u201d Roberta McCain, dressed in black pants and a white blouse that matched the snow-white of her perfectly coifed hair, appeared poised and serene during the service. At one point she reached out to grasp the hand of her granddaughter Meghan, who sat weeping beside her. Using a wheelchair to make her way to the center of the Rotunda, the senator\u2019s mother crossed herself silently at his coffin. Following the ceremony, Mr. McCain\u2019s wife, Cindy, and Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and one of his closest friends, made their way to the Senate chamber to spend a few moments at Mr. McCain\u2019s desk, which bears a vase of white roses marking the passing of its former occupant. Out of the range of news photographers who captured the day\u2019s every ceremonial flourish, Mr. Graham sat at his desk, Ms. McCain at her husband\u2019s next to him, as they talked quietly for a few minutes in the same spot where Mr. McCain delivered his final Senate floor speech last year. Mr. Graham pulled out two of the roses and gave them to his friend\u2019s widow. Mr. McCain\u2019s remembrance drew many mourners who identified themselves as proud Democrats, and said they had never voted for the senator and had frequently disagreed with his policies. With sharp criticism of the current administration and the polarization in Congress, they said he was among the last politicians willing to take bipartisan steps. \u201cWe lost a good one in John,\u201d said Kitt Rodkey, 64, who took a personal day from work to pay his respects to Mr. McCain. \u201cNo one is perfect, but he came pretty close.\u201d Standing next to him, Cooper Brockington, a therapist from Reston, Va., nodded emphatically as she fanned herself in the humidity. \u201cWe are all family,\u201d she said. \u201cI believe in paying my respect to our great servants.\u201d Veterans also came in droves \u2014 some wearing hats from the Veterans of Foreign Wars and the American Legion, along with uniform hats and vests studded with badges and buttons marking their service \u2014 to honor a man who was a Navy pilot and spent his years in Congress advocating strongly on behalf of the military and veterans. \u201cI wanted to come down and shake his hand, and say thank you,\u201d said Carmine Garritano, 71, a retired Army specialist who served in Vietnam, his voice shaking with emotion. Mr. Garritano said he had tried for years to find an opportunity to meet Mr. McCain in Washington. Instead, he drove down from New York with his daughter on Friday to see the senator lying in state. \u201cThis is the least I could do,\u201d he said. Mr. McCain is to be buried on Sunday at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md. Kyle Moses, an Army major stationed at Fort Meade in Maryland, brought his young son Sam along to pay tribute to a senator he said \u201cwas always looking out for the military.\u201d \u201cIt does make me think, \u2018Is this the end of an era?\u2019 \u201d he said, looking down at his son, who was clutching a stuffed animal. \u201cI hope it\u2019s a good inflection point and not a bad one. I hope we swing back to the way that the senator conducted himself.\u201d",

      "author": "Nicholas Fandos",
      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 Senator John McCain of Arizona, who has been battling brain cancer for more than a year, will no longer be treated for his condition, his family announced on Friday, a sign that the Republican war hero is most likely entering his final days. \u201cLast summer, Senator John McCain shared with Americans the news our family already knew: He had been diagnosed with an aggressive glioblastoma, and the prognosis was serious. In the year since, John has surpassed expectations for his survival. But the progress of disease and the inexorable advance of age render their verdict,\u201d the family said in a statement. \u201cWith his usual strength of will, he has now chosen to discontinue medical treatment.\u201d Mr. McCain, 81, had been undergoing treatment since July 2017, and has been absent from Washington since December. Mr. McCain\u2019s family has gathered in Arizona, and people close to him say his death is imminent. From his ranch in Arizona, Mr. McCain had managed to maintain a voice in key foreign policy and military policy debates, sharply criticizing President Trump after his summit meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, an old adversary of Mr. McCain. At home, he has welcomed close friends to renew ties. But after decades as a fixture in Washington and a larger-than-life character, he had largely retreated from the public eye. Senators from both parties quickly wrote to comfort Mr. McCain\u2019s family and lauded his service. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican majority leader and an occasional McCain sparring partner, wrote on Twitter that Mr. McCain has been a \u201cdear friend\u201d with whom he was lucky to serve in the Senate. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, said, \u201cMay the prayers and affection of his country, and of friends around the world, surround John and his beloved family in these peaceful final hours.\u201d The son and grandson of four-star Navy admirals who spent more than five years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, Mr. McCain rose to become one of the towering figures in American politics, twice seeking the presidency and winning the 2008 Republican nomination for president. In the Senate, he has been both revered as an iconoclast and criticized by many, including Mr. Trump, for his willingness to buck his party on issues like campaign finance reform and, last summer, the repeal of the Affordable Care Act. Under Mr. Trump\u2019s leadership, Mr. McCain has watched his party steer sharply away from many of the values he long championed. A fierce advocate for an expansive and interventionist American foreign policy, Mr. McCain has fretted as Mr. Trump moved the party toward \u201cAmerica First\u201d policies, criticizing longtime American allies and institutions like NATO, while praising adversaries like Russia. For decades, Mr. McCain advocated on behalf of refugees and was a leading \u2014 if intermittent \u2014 Republican voice in a few efforts to overhaul the American immigration system. Mr. Trump has tried to strictly limit both. Though he was unable to vote on the Republican tax cut bill late last year, a top Trump priority, Mr. McCain\u2019s endorsement helped secure its passage. Still, neither Mr. McCain nor Mr. Trump has held back from airing their differences, often with bruising consequences. As a candidate, Mr. Trump openly said he did not consider Mr. McCain a war hero, saying he preferred \u201cpeople who weren\u2019t captured.\u201d Since Mr. McCain helped kill the Republican effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Mr. Trump has made mimicking the Arizona Republican\u2019s thumbs-down vote a staple of his stump speeches. \u201cThat was not a good thing when he put the thumb down,\u201d Mr. Trump said at one rally in June. And this month, when Mr. Trump signed into law a huge defense policy bill named after Mr. McCain, the president made no mention of the senator, who is the chairman of the Armed Services Committee. Mr. McCain has not held his tongue either. In his final book, \u201cThe Restless Wave,\u201d published in May, Mr. McCain sharply criticized Mr. Trump\u2019s moral character, warning against his apparent admiration for autocratic leaders and his sharp crackdown on immigration. After Mr. Trump seemingly accepted Mr. Putin\u2019s denial of Russian election interference, Mr. McCain penned a blistering statement, calling the summit meeting \u201cone of the most disgraceful performances by an American president in memory.\u201d Mr. McCain has made clear he intends to remain a senator until his death. It will fall to Gov. Doug Ducey of Arizona, a Republican, to appoint his successor to serve through 2020. The choice is not necessarily a simple one. The state already has an open contest to replace Senator Jeff Flake, who is retiring, in November and a competitive Republican primary scheduled for next Tuesday. Mr. Ducey could name Representative Martha McSally, a relatively moderate former Air Force fighter pilot who is running in the Republican primary to replace Mr. Flake. In doing so, he would ensure that Ms. McSally, a favorite of Republicans in Washington, would have a seat in the Senate. But such a move would also clear the way for Joe Arpaio or Kelli Ward, two conservative hard-liners competing with Ms. McSally, to win the Republican nomination for Mr. Flake\u2019s seat and increase the chances of losing it to the Democrats. Mr. Ducey could also choose Cindy McCain, Mr. McCain\u2019s wife, for the seat. But Ms. McCain is a relative moderate and could make it more difficult for Republican leaders in Washington to hold together their narrow majority on key votes.",

      "author": "Simon Romero",
      "content": " PHOENIX \u2014 As the motorcade carrying the body of Senator John S. McCain made its way into Phoenix this weekend, Arizonans lined up on the side of roads, some with hands over their hearts, others saluting, as if somberly acknowledging that a political era was coming to an end. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be decades in Arizona before we see another political figure with the international stature of John McCain,\u201d said Douglas Cole, a fourth-generation Arizonan and political consultant who once worked as a staffer for Mr. McCain. Without hiding the fact that he was an outsider in this part of the West, Mr. McCain nevertheless came to symbolize a tradition in Arizona in which a select group of elected officials wielded outsize influence in the state and beyond. After moving here in the early 1980s, he emerged as a towering figure in a state known for other monumental political figures, such as Carl Hayden, a Democrat who served in Congress from 1912 to 1968; and Barry M. Goldwater, the pioneer of the modern conservative movement who was the Republican nominee for president in 1964. Rising into the company of such giants in Arizona \u2014 arguably one of Mr. McCain\u2019s defining legacies for many constituents in the state he represented \u2014 didn\u2019t come easy for the senator. But his unvarnished explanation of how he ended up fighting for a place in the conservative bastion\u2019s congressional delegation suited some in Arizona just fine. Mr. McCain had just retired from the Navy, moved to Arizona and entered the political arena in 1982 in a run for a seat in the House of Representatives. Trailing Republican rivals in the polls and growing weary of critics calling him a carpetbagger, he snapped back during a forum with other candidates. \u201cListen, pal, I spent 22 years in the Navy,\u201d Mr. McCain, who was born in the Panama Canal Zone and attended some 20 different schools growing up in a military family, said at the time. \u201cWe in the military service tend to move a lot,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe have to live in all parts of the country, all parts of the world. I wish I could have had the luxury, like you, of growing up and living and spending my entire life in a nice place like the First District of Arizona, but I was doing other things. As a matter of fact, when I think about it now, the place I lived longest in my life was Hanoi.\u201d Going on to prevail in that race, Mr. McCain never lost another election for Congress in Arizona. He and his wife, Cindy, the heiress to an Arizona beer distribution fortune, owned condos in Arlington, Va., and La Jolla, Calif., but the place where Mr. McCain may ultimately have felt most at home was in Cornville, Ariz., a town of 3,300 people north of Phoenix. The McCains bought a ranch in Cornville called Hidden Valley, at the end of a bumpy dirt road, and built guest quarters on the property. Mr. McCain became known for grilling burgers for visitors or frequenting local haunts in town, where his neighbors grew accustomed to seeing him without a security detail. \u201cJohn would come in wearing a T-shirt that said \u2018Gone Fishing\u2019 on it, sit at the bar and order a cocktail,\u201d said Mario Aguilar-Aello, the co-owner of Up the Creek, a bistro and wine bar in Cornville. He said one of the senator\u2019s favorite drinks was sambuca, the Italian anise-flavored liqueur; Mr. McCain would often order ribs or \u00e9touff\u00e9e, the Cajun dish served with shellfish over rice. \u201cEvery once in a while an individual would come up to him with a pointed question, but he\u2019d just smile and say, \u2018I\u2019d love to tell you what I think on that, but Mario doesn\u2019t allow politics at the bar,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Aguilar-Aello. \u201cThis was where he came to relax, to be a regular person, and people in the town respected that.\u201d Mr. Cole, the former staffer for Mr. McCain, said that the state proved to be the right fit for a politician prepared to go out on a limb and work with, or sometimes energetically oppose, leaders in both parties. \u201cArizona has always had a deep independent streak,\u201d said Mr. Cole. The political landscape in the state is in flux now, with Mr. McCain\u2019s passing and a bruising Republican primary set for Tuesday to replace Senator Jeff Flake, the Republican who announced that he would not seek another term after clashing with President Trump. Offering a glimpse of the scars that some of Mr. McCain\u2019s political battles produced in Arizona, some of the remembrances of him here were possibly as multilayered and complex as Mr. McCain himself. In an essay for The Phoenix New Times, a weekly newspaper, the journalist Amy Silverman described the callousness with which Mr. McCain would sometimes treat rivals, especially Democrats who are women. \u201cMcCain could be a very colorful character, very real, he\u2019d let it all hang out,\u201d said Ms. Silverman, arguing that Mr. McCain never completely overcame his transplant status. She questioned the senator\u2019s priorities in seeking to avoid, possibly to Arizona\u2019s detriment, the pork-barrel spending projects that politicians elsewhere often prioritize, to the benefit of their constituents. \u201cFor those of us here in Arizona, as McCain spent more and more time burnishing his reputation with the national media, well, maybe familiarity breeds contempt,\u201d Ms. Silverman said, contending that Mr. McCain be remembered as \u201cAmerica\u2019s senator, not Arizona\u2019s.\u201d Mr. McCain might have argued otherwise, posting photos on social media, even as he dealt with cancer treatment, of hiking with his family in the hills around Cornville. Arizona, which catapulted him onto the national stage, served as his refuge as he expressed regret over the intensifying partisanship in United States politics. \u201cHe suffered fools poorly, and that\u2019s something people in Arizona admired him for,\u201d said Gibson McKay, a former aide to Mr. McCain, pointing to the honor guard of veterans standing watch at the mortuary here in Phoenix, guarding Mr. McCain's remains. \u201cThat straightforwardness, coupled with the tenacity with which he fought for his beliefs, earned him admiration. With John, you got what you saw.\u201d",

      "author": "Michael R. Gordon",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Senator John McCain has long had a reputation as a political maverick. But with the rise of a president who has vowed to shatter the old order, Mr. McCain has emerged as an outspoken defender of longstanding Republican verities on foreign policy and as one of his party\u2019s most biting critics of the new commander in chief. Newly re-elected to a six-year term and eager to wield the megaphone that comes with the chairmanship of the powerful Armed Services Committee, Mr. McCain has repeatedly pushed back on the White House\u2019s national security policies in its first weeks. In a star turn at a security conference in Munich on Friday, he delivered a forceful critique of President Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d vision before a receptive audience of experts and allied officials worried about American drift from a seven-decade-old Western alliance. \u201cMake no mistake, my friends, these are dangerous times,\u201d Mr. McCain said. \u201cBut you should not count America out, and we should not count each other out.\u201d Nor did Mr. McCain hesitate to puncture Mr. Trump\u2019s insistence that his White House is operating like a \u201cfine-tuned machine.\u201d \u201cIn many respects, this administration is in disarray, and they\u2019ve got a lot of work to do,\u201d he said. A day later, in an interview for \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Mr. McCain challenged Mr. Trump\u2019s contention that the news media is \u201cthe enemy of the American people.\u201d \u201cThe first thing that dictators do is shut down the press,\u201d he said, adding that while he was not calling the president a dictator, \u201cwe need to learn the lessons of history.\u201d For a senator who supports free trade, backs NATO, remains deeply suspicious of Russian intentions and has favored an assertive foreign policy, including the war in Iraq, the differences with Mr. Trump have been profound. \u201cThe principles that Senator McCain has espoused have animated American foreign policy for decades,\u201d said Richard Fontaine, a former foreign policy adviser to Mr. McCain who currently serves as president of the Center for a New American Security, a policy research center. \u201cIt\u2019s the political context in Washington that has changed.\u201d But there seems to be a personal element, too, particularly on the part of Mr. Trump. The tensions go back to the Republican primaries, when Mr. Trump offered a belittling rejoinder to Mr. McCain\u2019s remark that the candidate\u2019s immigration policies had attracted \u201ccrazies.\u201d \u201cI like people that weren\u2019t captured,\u201d Mr. Trump said of Mr. McCain, 80, who was held for more than five years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam and was tortured while in captivity. After Mr. Trump won the Republican nomination, Mr. McCain walked a fine line while campaigning for re-election. The senator did not attend the Republican National Convention, but said he would back his party\u2019s nominee. He then withdrew that support in October after a recording was disclosed in which Mr. Trump made lewd comments about women. Immediately after Mr. Trump\u2019s election, Mr. McCain held his fire and appeared determined to let the new administration take shape. \u201cI will not talk about Donald Trump,\u201d he barked at a group of reporters in November. But after weeks in which the White House has blindsided the public, and sometimes much of the government, with executive orders and sent mixed messages on major foreign policy issues, Mr. McCain has let loose. Denouncing Russia for \u201cinterfering\u201d in the presidential election, Mr. McCain has called for the formation of a select Senate committee to investigate the Kremlin\u2019s cyberactivities. He has also chastised Mr. Trump for a comment in which he seemed to equate the actions of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia with those of the United States. \u201cThat moral equivalency is a contradiction of everything the United States has ever stood for in the 20th and 21st centuries,\u201d Mr. McCain said on \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d Along with Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, he has criticized Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order on travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries as a \u201cself-inflicted wound\u201d that would alienate Muslim partners in the fight against extremists. After reports surfaced that Mr. Trump had engaged in a heated phone call with Australia\u2019s prime minister, Mr. McCain placed his own call to Joe Hockey, Australia\u2019s ambassador to Washington, and then put out a statement noting that he had underscored \u201cunwavering support for the U.S.-Australian alliance.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a vast trade deal, Mr. McCain said, \u201ccreates an opening for China.\u201d He has also warned the White House against trying to use torture as an interrogation technique, pointing out that legislation he sponsored in 2015 made those techniques illegal. And while he is a strong supporter of two retired Marine generals in the administration \u2014 Jim Mattis, the defense secretary, and John F. Kelly, the homeland security secretary \u2014 he was the lone Republican to vote against Mick Mulvaney, Mr. Trump\u2019s pick for budget chief. On the Senate floor, Mr. McCain complained that Mr. Mulvaney had supported military spending cuts that seriously weakened the armed forces. Mr. McCain has also complained loudly about the role of Stephen K. Bannon, the president\u2019s chief political strategist, on the National Security Council. All this blunt talk has not come without some pushback. This month, Mr. Trump blasted Mr. McCain for his criticism of a risky Special Operations raid in Yemen in which a Navy SEAL was killed. \u201cHe\u2019s been losing so long he doesn\u2019t know how to win anymore,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Twitter. Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, said on Sunday that Mr. McCain had a \u201cpersonal dispute\u201d with Mr. Trump and criticized what he called the senator\u2019s eagerness to use military force. \u201cI would say John McCain has been wrong on just about everything over the last four decades,\u201d Mr. Paul said on the ABC News program \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re very lucky John McCain\u2019s not in charge because I think we\u2019d be in perpetual war.\u201d If the opening month of the administration is any indication, there may be perpetual conflict \u2014 between senator and president.",

On Tuesday, the focus of Mr. Trump\u2019s ire was Mr. McCain\u2019s historic vote on health care in 2017, when he went against his own party and opposed a Republican measure to repeal the Affordable Care Act. \u201cHe campaigned on repealing and replacing Obamacare for years, and then he got to a vote and he said thumbs down,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Tuesday after taking reporters\u2019 questions alongside the president of Brazil, who was at the White House for an official visit. \u201cOur country would have saved a trillion dollars and we would have had great health care.\u201d Over the weekend, however, Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks on Mr. McCain largely focused on the Russia investigation. Mr. Trump derided Mr. McCain, the Republican nominee for president in 2008, for sharing with the F.B.I. a copy of a salacious and uncorroborated dossier on the Trump campaign\u2019s dealings with Russia, though Mr. Trump falsely claimed Mr. McCain had shared it with the agency before the election.

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 If President Trump had wanted to make a gracious mention of John McCain, the ailing Republican senator from Arizona, he could have done it on Monday, when the president signed the $716 billion military spending bill named in Mr. McCain\u2019s honor. He didn\u2019t. Standing in front of soldiers and senior military leaders at Fort Drum in New York, Mr. Trump made no mention of Mr. McCain, 81, who has been one of the president\u2019s fiercest critics but has largely been absent from the Senate as he struggles with advanced brain cancer. The president studiously avoided reading the official name of the legislation \u2014 which would have meant mentioning Mr. McCain \u2014 during the 28-minute speech or during the signing ceremony afterward. (The spending measure is officially called the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019.) Mr. Trump called it the \u201cthe most significant investment in our military, and our war fighters in modern history,\u201d but did not make any reference to Mr. McCain\u2019s military service or decades-long career fighting for the Pentagon budget. The snub was not entirely unexpected. The president has repeatedly disparaged Mr. McCain, usually without using his name, even in the months since the senator has largely retreated from the Washington scene to his Arizona home for cancer treatment. At a June rally, Mr. Trump criticized Mr. McCain for voting against a Republican bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act, saying that \u201cone senator decided to put the thumb down, late in the morning. That was not a good thing when he put the thumb down.\u201d The president mocked him the same way during a speech to conservatives in February, prompting loud and angry boos from the audience at the reference to Mr. McCain. And just hours after signing the military spending bill on Monday, he did the same thing at a fund-raiser in upstate New York. The relationship between the two men has never been good. As a candidate, Mr. Trump said he did not like Mr. McCain because the senator, a Navy pilot during the war in Vietnam, was shot down and captured, held for more than five years in a North Vietnamese prison and repeatedly tortured. \u201cHe\u2019s not a war hero,\u201d Mr. Trump said at the time. \u201cHe\u2019s a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren\u2019t captured.\u201d For his part, Mr. McCain has long been critical of Mr. Trump. When Mr. Trump was running for president, the senator criticized him for attacking Khizr Khan, the father of a fallen soldier. More recently, Mr. McCain issued a statement critical of Mr. Trump\u2019s Helsinki summit meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Mr. McCain called it \u201cone of the most disgraceful performances by an American president in memory.\u201d During his three-decade career in the Senate, Mr. McCain has been a longtime supporter of the military. As chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Mr. McCain was one of the most important voices in passing the vast military spending bill that Mr. Trump signed on Monday.",

      "author": "Eric Schmitt",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Mick Mulvaney, President Trump\u2019s acting chief of staff, sought on Sunday to play down the White House\u2019s directive to hide a Navy destroyer named after Senator John McCain during the president\u2019s visit to a naval base in Japan last week. Mr. Mulvaney said that a young White House staff member, knowing of Mr. Trump\u2019s animosity toward  Mr. McCain, most likely made the request to the Navy to block the warship from view. The Navy at first complied, placing a giant tarp over the name and then hiding it with a barge before senior admirals reversed the decision. \u201cIf a 23- or 24-year-old person says, \u2018Look, is it really a good idea for this ship to be in the background?\u2019 that is not an unreasonable question,\u201d Mr. Mulvaney said on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d adding, \u201cWe think it\u2019s much ado about nothing.\u201d Asked about the matter on NBC News\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Mr. Mulvaney said it would be \u201csilly\u201d to fire the aide over the episode, which has drawn a torrent of criticism from retired military officers. Mr. Trump insisted last week that he knew nothing about the hide-the-ship scheme, but called it a \u201cwell meaning\u201d gesture. The acting defense secretary, Patrick Shanahan, had also said he was unaware of the White House directive, and on Sunday warned the White House in his strongest language yet not to politicize the nation\u2019s armed forces, which have traditionally been viewed as apolitical. \u201cThere is no room for politicizing the military,\u201d Mr. Shanahan told reporters traveling with him to Seoul, South Korea. Lt. Col. Joe Buccino, a spokesman for Mr. Shanahan, said in a statement that the secretary\u2019s chief of staff had conveyed that same message to the White House military office. Mr. Shanahan had told reporters during a security conference in Singapore on Friday that he would not have moved the destroyer to keep it out of photos with Mr. Trump, and asked his chief of staff to get to the bottom of things. On Sunday, Mr. Shanahan said he did not plan to call for an inspector general investigation into the incident, for which Navy officials have blamed a group of lower-level Navy planning officers and a midlevel White House advance team. In addition to Mr. McCain, the ship is named after his grandfather, John S. McCain Sr., a Navy admiral during World War II, and his father, John S. McCain Jr., an admiral in the Vietnam War era. Sailors aboard the McCain were not invited to hear Mr. Trump speak on a nearby amphibious assault ship, the Wasp, but sailors from other American warships at Yokosuka Naval Base in Japan were welcomed aboard. Even though Mr. Shanahan has denied knowing about the White House directive, questions about why the Navy initially acquiesced to it are likely to dog him when he goes before the Senate for his confirmation hearing in the coming weeks.",

      "author": "Carl Hulse",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Senator John McCain, the 2008 Republican presidential nominee known for his independent streak over more than three decades representing Arizona in the Senate, has brain cancer, his office disclosed Wednesday night in a statement from the Mayo Clinic. Mr. McCain, 80, has a glioblastoma, one of the most common but also one of the most malignant brain tumors. It can be treated with chemotherapy and radiation, but medical experts said it almost always grows back. Mr. McCain\u2019s office said he was recuperating at his home in Arizona and \u201cappreciates the outpouring of support he has received over the last few days.\u201d His office said Mr. McCain would decide when to return to the Senate as he consults with his medical advisers. Medical experts said the type of tumor Mr. McCain has is particularly aggressive. The median survival of a glioblastoma is about 16 months, said Eugene S. Flamm, chairman of neurosurgery at Montefiore Hospital in the Bronx. Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts died in 2009 from the same kind of aggressive brain tumor. Mr. McCain learned of the tumor after undergoing surgery late last week at the Mayo Clinic Hospital in Phoenix to remove a blood clot above his left eye. Mr. McCain, the son of a prominent family dedicated to military service, has been in American life since the 1960s. He was the public face of the mistreatment of American prisoners at the North Vietnamese camp known as the Hanoi Hilton, where as a Navy pilot he was confined and tortured for over five years. Decades later, he was the happy-go-lucky captain of the Straight Talk Express, the campaign bus where he cultivated his image as a candid political maverick in his failed 2000 presidential run. He was elected to a sixth Senate term this past November. Four presidents \u2014 Donald J. Trump, Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and the elder George Bush \u2014 issued heartfelt statements wishing Mr. McCain a speedy recovery late Wednesday. \u201cSenator John McCain has always been a fighter,\u201d Mr. Trump said. Mr. Obama, who defeated Mr. McCain in the 2008 election, called the senator a \u201chero & one of the bravest fighters I\u2019ve ever known.\u201d \u201cCancer doesn\u2019t know what it\u2019s up against,\u201d Mr. Obama tweeted. \u201cGive it hell, John.\u201d The diagnosis shook the Senate, where Mr. McCain is a popular figure despite his occasionally heated disputes with colleagues in both parties. His illness had implications this week for the health care debate, causing Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, to postpone a floor fight until Mr. McCain returned to Washington. On Wednesday night, about a dozen lawmakers gathered in the Dirksen Senate Office Building to explore a health care compromise asked Senator James Lankford, an Oklahoma Republican who is a Baptist minister, to lead them in prayer for their colleague. \u201cIt was very emotional,\u201d said Senator John Hoeven, Republican of North Dakota, who was present. He said finding a solution to the health care impasse was \u201cmore challenging without him.\u201d Mr. McConnell called Mr. McCain a hero to both Senate Republicans and the nation at large. \u201cHe has never shied from a fight, and I know that he will face this challenge with the same extraordinary courage that has characterized his life,\u201d Mr. McConnell said Wednesday night. \u201cWe all look forward to seeing this American hero again soon.\u201d Mr. McCain endured grueling rehabilitation from his time in the prison camp but later led the effort to reconcile with Hanoi in a striking gesture of forgiveness. After quickly becoming prominent as a House member in his first election in 1982, Mr. McCain won the Senate seat given up by the Arizona icon Barry Goldwater in 1986. He became a fixture in the Senate, where he denounced the corrosive effects of big money in political campaigns and was a central player in congressional debates on military policy, immigration and health care. Wednesday\u2019s disclosure suggested that Mr. McCain\u2019s condition was more serious than initially believed, although the statement said that \u201che is recovering from his surgery \u2018amazingly well,\u2019\u201d according to his doctors, \u201cand his underlying health is excellent.\u201d As the Republican health care bill teetered in recent days, Mr. Trump referred affectionately to Mr. McCain as a \u201ccrusty voice\u201d in the capital. But their relationship has been fraught. In July 2015, during the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump denigrated Mr. McCain\u2019s military record, saying he was considered a war hero only because he was captured. \u201cI like people who weren\u2019t captured,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a comment that many suggested had gone too far. Mr. McCain, who at the time was facing conservative opposition in his re-election bid, remained a supporter of Mr. Trump throughout the campaign. However, Mr. McCain has pressed for a deep investigation into any interference into the presidential campaign by Russia, which he considers an adversary. On Tuesday, and despite his condition, Mr. McCain issued a statement warning about Russian intrusion in Ukraine and calling for new sanctions against Moscow. Mr. McCain faced an uphill battle in 2008 given public discontentment with the United States-led war in Iraq and overall fatigue with the administration of George W. Bush. Mr. McCain picked Sarah Palin, then the governor of Alaska, as his vice-presidential running mate in an effort to reinvigorate a flagging campaign with a woman on the ticket. A crucial moment in the race occurred in late September 2008 when he suddenly suspended his campaign and returned to Washington for an economic summit meeting at the White House that was also attended by Mr. Obama, then a Democratic senator from Illinois. Mr. McCain\u2019s 11th-hour effort to focus on the economy was generally considered a lost opportunity, and the financial collapse helped propel Mr. Obama to the presidency. Mr. McCain currently leads the Senate Armed Services Committee and is a top proponent of using military force overseas. The Senate is preparing to take up the annual Pentagon policy measure produced by the committee. In Congress, he is probably best known for his efforts to champion changes in campaign finance laws over the fierce objections of some of his Republican colleagues, particularly Mr. McConnell. The standard of care includes surgery to remove as much of the tumor as possible, and then radiation and chemotherapy. In the past, radiation sometimes diminished patients\u2019 brain function, but techniques have improved so that more healthy brain tissue is spared and patients fare better, said Dr. Mitchel S. Berger, a neurosurgeon and glioblastoma expert at the University of California, San Francisco. Jeff Flake, the junior Republican senator from Arizona, acknowledged the seriousness of Mr. McCain\u2019s diagnosis in a still-hopeful Twitter post. \u201cTough diagnosis, but even tougher man,\u201d Mr. Flake wrote.",

      "content": "   LIMA, Ohio \u2014 It is an obsession he cannot seem to shake. Senator John McCain of Arizona has been dead for seven months, but President Trump\u2019s feud with him is very much alive, and in front of a military audience at a tank plant here in Lima, Ohio, on Wednesday, he took it to a new level. He said he gave Mr. McCain \u201cthe funeral he wanted, and I didn\u2019t get \u2018thank you,\u2019\u201d exaggerating the role he played in honoring the senator\u2019s death four days before his 82nd birthday. He blamed him for \u201ca war in the Middle East that McCain pushed so hard.\u201d He said that \u201cMcCain didn\u2019t get the job done for our great vets\u201d and the Department of Veterans Affairs. And he was blunt in saying that his animosity toward Mr. McCain was not going to change. \u201cI have to be honest: I\u2019ve never liked him much,\u201d Mr. Trump said, about 10 minutes into a freewheeling speech that was ostensibly about the resurgence of manufacturing jobs. \u201cHasn\u2019t been for me. I\u2019ve really \u2014 probably never will.\u201d The long, antagonistic history between the president and Mr. McCain, in his youth a Navy pilot and prisoner of war celebrated for his bravery and later known as a maverick in the Republican Party, dates to the early days of the 2016 presidential campaign. Mr. Trump, who never served in the military, said Mr. McCain was not a war hero, adding, \u201cI like people who weren\u2019t captured.\u201d Mr. Trump was reacting to the senator\u2019s accusation that he riled up \u201ccrazies\u201d with inflammatory remarks about illegal immigration across the Mexican border. His attack on Mr. McCain, the party\u2019s 2008 presidential candidate, horrified his own aides and led Republican leaders to denounce the outsider who was already disrupting their party. It also proved to be an early example of Mr. Trump\u2019s ability to remain undamaged by any self-created controversy. Now, months after Mr. McCain\u2019s death in August, Mr. Trump suddenly cannot stop talking about his old adversary, outraging Mr. McCain\u2019s supporters and creating another divide \u2014 if only temporary \u2014 between himself and congressional Republicans. His attacks began over the weekend, when the president used his Twitter feed to berate Mr. McCain for his role in giving the F.B.I. a dossier of unverified information about Mr. Trump\u2019s connections to Russia that was compiled by a former British spy \u2014 a dossier the F.B.I. already had. He brought up Mr. McCain\u2019s vote against repealing the Affordable Care Act. He claimed that Mr. McCain, a former prisoner of war, was \u201clast in his class\u201d at the Naval Academy, when Mr. McCain actually graduated fifth from the bottom. On Tuesday, seated in the Oval Office next to President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, Mr. Trump told reporters that he was \u201cnever a fan\u201d of Mr. McCain, and never would be. And on Wednesday, Mr. Trump reiterated all those reasons in a diatribe that was part of a week that Mr. Trump seems to have dedicated to airing personal feuds. He has spent days criticizing George T. Conway III, the husband of Kellyanne Conway, one of his top advisers, who has been raising alarms about the president\u2019s mental health and calling him unfit for office via his Twitter feed. On his way to Ohio, Mr. Trump called Mr. Conway a \u201cwhack job,\u201d capping two days of back and forth with the spouse of one of his most loyal and longest-serving aides. But his relentless fixation on Mr. McCain was more reminiscent of an election-year feud Mr. Trump escalated against a Gold Star father, Khizr Khan, who spoke at the Democratic National Convention, and, brandishing a pocket Constitution, challenged Mr. Trump for smearing the character of Muslims. Republicans once again denounced Mr. Trump when he continued to attack Mr. Khan and his wife, who Mr. Trump implied was forced against her will to stand silently by her husband\u2019s side during the emotional speech. The feud with Mr. McCain, however, has carried into his presidency, even after the man who was considered an elder statesman of the Senate learned he had brain cancer and eventually died. Planning his funeral, Mr. McCain made it clear that the president would not be welcome, leaving Mr. Trump to fume when his two immediate predecessors, Barack Obama and George W. Bush, eulogized Mr. McCain in a service at Washington National Cathedral. The president\u2019s response was to stall on issuing any proclamation of praise, or ordering flags to be flown at half-staff to commemorate the senator\u2019s death. His posthumous attacks have been cheered at the president\u2019s Make America Great rallies. But at the army tank plant in Lima, where Mr. Trump said a third of the work force is made up of veterans, the denunciations drew no cheers. And they once again resulted in rare criticism from Mr. Trump\u2019s own party. On Wednesday, Senator Johnny Isakson, Republican of Georgia, called out the president\u2019s string of recent comments about Mr. McCain. \u201cIt\u2019s deplorable what he said,\u201d Mr. Isakson said in an interview with Georgia Public Broadcasting\u2019s \u201cPolitical Rewind\u201d radio show, adding, \u201cIt will be deplorable seven months from now if he says it again, and I will continue to speak out.\u201d He joined Senator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, who had criticized the president on Tuesday. \u201cI can\u2019t understand why the President would, once again, disparage a man as exemplary as my friend John McCain: heroic, courageous, patriotic, honorable, self-effacing, self-sacrificing, empathetic, and driven by duty to family, country, and God,\u201d Mr. Romney wrote on Twitter. Other Republicans, like Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, however, were more muted in responding to Mr. Trump\u2019s latest attacks, choosing to emphasize their support for Mr. McCain rather than confront the president. But at least one Democratic presidential candidate used the moment to demand change in the White House. \u201cThis Vietnam vet was brought to tears when hearing the stories of the President going after John McCain this week, as well as the lack of focus on mental health for kids in this country,\u201d Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, wrote on Twitter, with a picture of her embracing a veteran. Mr. McCain\u2019s family, meanwhile, responded in his stead. \u201cThis is a new bizarre low,\u201d Mr. McCain\u2019s daughter, Meghan McCain, said on \u201cThe View\u201d on Wednesday. \u201cI will say attacking someone who isn\u2019t here is a bizarre low. My dad\u2019s not here, but I\u2019m sure as hell here.\u201d She added: \u201cI think if I had told my dad, \u2018Seven months after you\u2019re dead, you\u2019re going to be dominating the news and all over Twitter,\u2019 he would think it\u2019s hilarious that our president was so jealous of him that he was dominating the news cycle in death as well.\u201d Mr. McCain\u2019s widow, Cindy McCain, for her part, shared on Twitter a hateful message she received after Mr. Trump\u2019s most recent attacks, in which the sender wished that Ms. McCain\u2019s daughter \u201cchokes to death.\u201d Mark Salter, Mr. McCain\u2019s closest political adviser and a harsh critic of the president, said all of Mr. Trump\u2019s personal attacks against critics were of a piece. \u201cThe problem isn\u2019t Trump\u2019s disrespect to John and his family \u2014 it\u2019s Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s unfit for the office, and most members of Congress know he is. I hope this latest evidence of that convinces more people that he can\u2019t be ignored.\u201d",

John S. McCain|May 31, 2019, Page A19",

      "content": " The White House\u2019s request that the Navy hide a destroyer that honors Senator John McCain during President Trump\u2019s recent trip to Japan has ignited a furor over how the administration, from the president down, has acted toward the Navy veteran and longtime Arizona lawmaker, who died in August 2018. Although Mr. Trump denied personally playing any role in asking the Navy to prevent the U.S.S. John S. McCain from appearing in photographs with the president during his state visit, the disclosure of the White House\u2019s request immediately turned the ship into a political symbol. Here are some questions and answers about the McCain. It is now, but he is not the only John McCain that the ship\u2019s name honors. The McCain was commissioned in 1994, and it was originally named for the senator\u2019s grandfather, Adm. John S. McCain Sr., who commanded a carrier task force in World War II, and father, Adm. John S. McCain Jr., a submarine commander in the war who later rose to head what was then known as United States Pacific Command. The senator, who was John S. McCain III, was added when the warship was rededicated last year. \u201cToday, we add the story of Senator John S. McCain to the spirit of the mighty vessel which already carries the legacy of his father and grandfather,\u201d Navy Secretary Richard V. Spencer said then. \u201cAs a warrior and a statesman who has always put country first, Senator John McCain never asked for this honor, and he would never seek it. But we would be remiss if we did not etch his name alongside his illustrious forebears, because this country would not be the same were it not for the courageous service of all three of these great men.\u201d The Navy said that the senator had \u201can active interest\u201d in the ship and its crew, and had visited it during a trip to Vietnam in 2017. The McCain is a destroyer whose home port is Yokosuka, Japan, where the United States maintains a naval base. Nicknamed \u201cBig Bad John,\u201d the ship is 505 feet long and has a crew of 338 people. The ship launched Tomahawk missiles as a part of the United States\u2019 invasion of Iraq in 2003, but it has spent most of its time in the waters around East Asia and participated in relief efforts after an earthquake struck Japan in 2011. The McCain collided with an oil tanker near Singapore in August 2017, killing 10 American sailors and prompting a Navy investigation and the removal of the ship\u2019s two top officers. The chief of naval operations, Adm. John M. Richardson, said that the collision had been \u201cavoidable.\u201d The McCain has been undergoing repairs and left dry dock in November, according to the Navy, which said the work on the ship was expected to be finished later this year. The Phoenix City Council voted in 2017 to name an airport terminal after Mr. McCain, and Arizona State University is home to the McCain Institute for International Leadership. Last year, not long after Mr. McCain died, an Arizona school district decided to name a planned new elementary school for him. \u201cThe qualities that Senator McCain so passionately and effectively represented are what we wish to enshrine as a model for the children of our community,\u201d Kristi Sandvik, the superintendent of schools, said last year. Other suggestions to name buildings for Mr. McCain \u2014 including a Senate office building in Washington and the Brussels headquarters of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization \u2014 have so far faltered. Not long before Mr. McCain died, Mr. Trump signed a $716 billion military spending bill that had been named for the ailing senator. The president did not mention Mr. McCain or the formal name of the legislation, the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019, during a speech and a signing ceremony.",

      "content": " PHOENIX \u2014 Military veterans lined both sides of the Capitol Plaza here on Wednesday as a black hearse delivered the coffin carrying Senator John S. McCain to the rotunda, where constituents began saying farewell to the war veteran who became a towering political figure in this part of the West. As Mr. McCain was lying in state, his immediate family and Arizona political leaders paid tribute to the naval aviator, who endured torture as a prisoner of war in Vietnam. They remembered him as an example of a statesman striving to unite Americans regardless of their political beliefs. \u201cIt\u2019s our job to show our respect,\u201d said Robbie Campbell, 59, a statewide captain of the Patriot Guard Riders, an organization composed largely of motorcyclists who attend the funerals of United States military service members and first responders. \u201cWe don\u2019t want anybody that serves to protect our freedoms to not know that the whole nation cares.\u201d Gov. Doug Ducey of Arizona embraced Mr. McCain\u2019s wife, Cindy McCain, as she arrived for a short private ceremony on the morning of what would have been her husband\u2019s 82nd birthday. A small group of political figures delivered brief remarks honoring and remembering Mr. McCain. His family listened quietly, then lined up to pass by the coffin. Cindy McCain briefly pressed her cheek against it as those in the chamber absorbed the scene. Mr. McCain\u2019s daughter, Meghan McCain, broke into tears as she approached the coffin to touch it. Her wailing echoed throughout the rotunda. John Kyl, a former Republican senator, said that although some people disagreed with Mr. McCain\u2019s political positions, \u201cthat should not diminish our gratitude for his service.\u201d \u201cI have been with Senator McCain all around the world, and I will tell you he had better instincts about how, when and where to assert American power than any other leader that I\u2019ve known,\u201d said Mr. Kyl, who has been mentioned as a potential choice to fill the seat left vacant by Mr. McCain. \u201cHe had been to more countries, knew more foreign leaders and had a better grasp of history than any other American official, including our secretaries of state,\u201d Mr. Kyl continued. \u201cOne illustration: When others were looking into Vladimir Putin\u2019s eyes with an eye of understanding him and reaching accommodation with him, John said, \u2018I looked into his eyes and I saw K.G.B.\u2019\u201d Also speaking were Governor Ducey and Senator Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican who is not running for re-election. Three former governors, Fife Symington, Janet Napolitano and Jan Brewer, were also in attendance, as were several state legislative leaders. \u201cWe think sometimes that politics is life and death,\u201d said Mr. Ducey, who will name the replacement to fill Mr. McCain\u2019s seat until the next general election in 2020. \u201cBut John McCain knew better \u2014 because he had actually seen death and dying and tragedy.\u201d \u201cAlong the way, he did it with humor and humanity, and without compromising the principles he held so dear,\u201d Mr. Ducey continued, quoting Mr. McCain when he once said, \u201cI\u2019d rather lose an election than lose a war.\u201d Said the governor: \u201cWe knew he was telling us the truth.\u201d Members of the public lined up outside the Arizona State Capitol for a general viewing throughout the afternoon. \u201cI\u2019m a lifelong Democrat, and I also served in Vietnam, so I came here to honor a man who never forgot about fellow veterans,\u201d said Marlin Porter, 71, a member of the Gila River Indian Community who waited in line for the viewing. \u201cJohn McCain was just so different from what we have in the White House now: a president who disrespects veterans.\u201d Charlie Phan, an immigrant and veteran of the South Vietnamese Army, came to the Capitol wearing a military uniform. \u201cHe fought the Communists and sacrificed for us,\u201d said Mr. Phan, the owner of a nail salon in Phoenix. Mr. McCain had represented Arizona in the House of Representatives and Senate since moving to the state in the early 1980s. He wielded outsize influence in Arizona, emerging as one of the state\u2019s most powerful leaders, often compared to figures like Carl Hayden, the Democrat who served in Congress from 1912 to 1968, and Barry Goldwater, the pioneer of the modern conservative movement who was the Republican presidential nominee in 1964. Only two other Arizonans have had the honor of lying in state in the Capitol: Marilyn Jarrett, a former state senator, in 2006, and the Olympic titan Jesse Owens, in 1980. Shortly before 2 p.m. local time, doors to the Capitol opened to the public. The Guard of Honor was to remain on duty throughout the night, as long as people were waiting in line. \u201cHe was a very open man,\u201d said Antonio Velasquez, 46, a Christian pastor and leader of a group seeking to promote the rights of Guatemalan immigrants. Mr. Velasquez brought a wreath to honor Mr. McCain on behalf of fellow Guatemalans, both in the United States and in Guatemala. \u201cIt's just part of our gratitude,\u201d Mr. Velasquez said. Jessica Grant-Wahpeta, an Arizona chef, said she paid tribute to Mr. McCain because \u201che stood up for all Americans.\u201d \u201cI wasn\u2019t in his party and didn\u2019t always agree with him,\u201d Ms. Grant-Wahpeta said. \u201cBut he was someone who knew how to do the right thing.\u201d The ceremony on Wednesday was the first of several events taking place in the coming days to honor Mr. McCain. On Thursday, the senator\u2019s body will be carried from the Capitol in a motorcade that will deliver him to the North Phoenix Baptist Church, where a memorial service will be held. About 1,000 seats at the church are available to the public. From the church, Mr. McCain\u2019s remains will be flown to Washington for another viewing on Friday at the United States Capitol. After a memorial service at the National Cathedral, Mr. McCain will be buried at the United States Naval Academy Cemetery in Annapolis, Md.",

      "author": "Jonathan Martin",
      "content": " PHOENIX \u2014 When former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. traveled to Senator John McCain\u2019s Arizona ranch last Sunday to spend a few hours with his ailing friend, the two reminisced about the \u201ccrazy senators\u201d they had served with, the overseas trips they took together for decades and the friendship Mr. McCain forged with Mr. Biden\u2019s two sons. But the conversation on the sun-splashed deck off Mr. McCain\u2019s bedroom was not all nostalgia. \u201cHere John knows he\u2019s in a very, very, very precarious situation, and yet he\u2019s still concerned about the state of the country,\u201d Mr. Biden said in an interview. \u201cWe talked about how our international reputation is being damaged and we talked about the need for people to stand up and speak out.\u201d As he battles brain cancer and the debilitating side effects of his aggressive treatment, Mr. McCain himself is reckoning with his history and the future, as he and a stream of friends share memories and say what needs to be said. No one is saying goodbye, not explicitly. The son and grandson of admirals, Mr. McCain \u201cdoesn\u2019t like overt sentimentality,\u201d as his friend the former chief of staff Grant Woods put it. But his visitors are telling him they love him, how much he has meant to them \u2014 and together they are taking care of unfinished business. The Republican senator encouraged the former Democratic vice president to \u201cnot walk away\u201d from politics, as Mr. Biden put it before refusing to discuss a possible 2020 presidential run. Mr. McCain is using a new book and documentary to reveal his regret about not selecting former Senator Joseph I. Lieberman as his running mate in 2008. His intimates have informed the White House that their current plan for his funeral is for Vice President Mike Pence to attend the service to be held in Washington\u2019s National Cathedral but not President Trump, with whom Mr. McCain has had a rocky relationship. And some of his associates, though not his family, have started to quietly put out word that they want a \u201cMcCain person\u201d eventually appointed to fill his Senate seat, a roster that includes his wife, Cindy. Mr. McCain, 81, is still in the fight, struggling with the grim diagnosis he received last summer: He has been leading conference calls with his staff in a strained voice, grinding out three-hour physical therapy sessions and rewarding himself most days with a tall glass of Absolut Elyx on ice. But his health has become a matter of immediate political interest. Mr. McCain\u2019s future may determine whether Republicans retain their single-seat Senate majority: Should the senator die or resign before the end of May, there will most likely be a special election for the seat this fall. But under Arizona law, if he remains in office into June, there will probably not be an election for the seat until 2020, which Republicans would prefer given Democratic enthusiasm this year. The matter of succession for the McCain seat \u2014 a topic of such intense discussion that Republicans officials here joke that Washington lawyers know Arizona election law better than any lawyer in the state \u2014 is officially verboten among party officials and the senator\u2019s friends. They are determined to reward him with the same good ending that his friend Senator Edward M. Kennedy enjoyed before he succumbed to brain cancer in 2009. Mr. McCain, who is not doing interviews, delights in sitting out on his deck where he once handled slabs of ribs on the grill, friends say. He and his wife listen to the hummingbirds and the burbling stream that runs through their 15-acre ranch, enjoy the verdant scenery in an otherwise arid region and divide their loyalties when the hawks start pestering Peanut, their Chihuahua mix. (Mrs. McCain sides with their dog, Mr. McCain the hawks.) \u201cHe finds real solace there,\u201d Mr. Biden said. A bout of diverticulitis temporarily landed him back in Phoenix\u2019s Mayo Clinic last month. It caused him to miss seeing more than a hundred of his friends and colleagues, including the new secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, and Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, who came to Arizona to attend the annual meeting of his foreign policy think tank, the McCain Institute. Mr. Lieberman filled in for Mr. McCain at the forum and visited the senator afterward at the hospital, mixing talk of North Korea and Iran with well-worn jokes, like the one about the difference between a lawyer and a catfish. (One is a bottom-feeding scum-sucker; the other is a fish.) \u201cHe was O.K., but he wanted to get out of the hospital,\u201d recalled Mr. Lieberman, one of Mr. McCain\u2019s closest friends. \u201cLook, this is a man whose whole life has been active.\u201d Having spent over two years in solitary confinement while he was imprisoned in Vietnam, Mr. McCain has no use for being alone, whether it is in the intensive care unit or at his ranch. And his deck is where he receives a constant flow of friends \u2014 with visits that often end with Mr. McCain saying, \u201cI love you\u201d \u2014 and takes calls on the iPhone he just swapped for his tattered flip phone. (Mr. McCain finally made the switch to download the Major League Baseball app to better follow his Arizona Diamondbacks.) Mr. Biden and his wife, Jill, were there last weekend; Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, a Republican, and his wife, Cheryl, visited Friday; other colleagues are set to come this week and his seven children are there as often as they can. The phone calls have been even more frequent: Former President George W. Bush checked in last week, telling Mr. McCain the country is missing him. In a visit on the deck earlier this year, Mr. Flake said he and Mr. McCain recalled how in the 1980s the legendary former Arizona congressman Morris Udall, a Democrat, had taken the newly elected Mr. McCain under his wing despite their differences in party. \u201cIt was the two of us lamenting the loss of the politics of the past,\u201d Mr. Flake said. It was also at his Hidden Valley Ranch where the senator participated in a nearly two-hour HBO documentary and co-wrote what he acknowledges will be his last book, \u201cThe Restless Wave,\u201d both of which are set to be released this month. The film and the book, a copy of which The New York Times obtained independently of Mr. McCain, amount to the senator\u2019s final say on his career and a concluding argument for a brand of pro-free trade and pro-immigration Republicanism that, along with his calls for preserving the American-led international order, have grown out of fashion under President Trump. In the book, Mr. McCain scorns Mr. Trump\u2019s seeming admiration for autocrats and disdain for refugees. \u201cHe seems uninterested in the moral character of world leaders and their regimes,\u201d he writes of the president. \u201cThe appearance of toughness or a reality show facsimile of toughness seems to matter more than any of our values. Flattery secures his friendship, criticism his enmity.\u201d Yet many in Mr. McCain\u2019s own party believe that, by selecting Sarah Palin as his running mate in 2008, he bears at least a small measure of blame for unleashing the forces of grievance politics and nativism within the Republican Party. While he continues to defend Ms. Palin\u2019s performance, Mr. McCain uses the documentary and the book to unburden himself about not selecting Mr. Lieberman, a Democrat-turned-independent, as his running mate. He recalls that his advisers warned him that picking a vice-presidential candidate who caucused with Democrats and supported abortion rights would divide Republicans and doom his chances. \u201cIt was sound advice that I could reason for myself,\u201d he writes. \u201cBut my gut told me to ignore it and I wish I had.\u201d Even more striking is how Mr. McCain expresses his sorrow in the documentary. He calls the decision not to pick Mr. Lieberman \u201canother mistake that I made\u201d in his political career, a self-indictment that includes his involvement in the Keating Five savings and loan scandal and his reluctance to speak out during his 2000 presidential bid about the Confederate battle flag flying above the South Carolina Capitol. Mr. Lieberman said he didn\u2019t know Mr. McCain felt that regret until he watched the film. \u201cIt touched me greatly,\u201d he said. Here in his adopted state, he has been immortalized as an icon. \u201cJohn McCain is a giant in Arizona,\u201d said Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican, expressing sentiments that were echoed by the teachers protesting at the state Capitol last week. Erik Gillman, a math instructor, said Mr. McCain had become the new Barry Goldwater, a figure as inextricably identified with the desert as cactus. \u201cIt\u2019s what people think about when they think about the state: the Grand Canyon and John McCain,\u201d Mr. Gillman said. But Mr. McCain\u2019s conservative detractors have not forgiven his maverick tendencies simply because he is ill. When Mr. Pence addressed a hard-right audience gathered in Tempe last week to promote the administration\u2019s tax cuts, he said that \u201cpeople all across America are praying for Senator John McCain\u201d \u2014 and one woman yelled out, \u201cto retire.\u201d Mr. McCain has long been both a flawed politician and a larger figure of history, by virtue of his refusal to be released early from Vietnamese captivity. Former Senator Robert J. Dole, for example, wore Mr. McCain\u2019s P.O.W. bracelet while his future colleague was in the Hanoi Hilton prison camp. Mr. Dole, now 94, said he planned to tell Mr. McCain in a coming phone call, \u201cYou\u2019re a tough guy and you can overcome this.\u201d In Washington, Mr. McCain\u2019s admirers believe the Senate and the Republican Party lack a needed counterbalance to Mr. Trump and worry that his absence only presages a larger decline in the country\u2019s politics. With Mr. Kennedy gone and Mr. McCain ailing, Representative John Lewis of Georgia, the civil rights legend, is one of the few figures left in Washington who evoke a bigness at a moment in history that can seem all too small. \u201cThe Senate is changing just like the country is changing,\u201d said Senator Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina Republican, who is Mr. McCain\u2019s closest friend in the chamber. \u201cBut Washington now reflects what\u2019s going on in the country, rather than leading it.\u201d Another McCain prot\u00e9g\u00e9e, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, a Democrat, said she treasured how Mr. McCain treated her when they went on the congressional delegation trips he loves and foreign leaders would attempt to recognize the male lawmakers before her. \u201cThey\u2019d always look to Lindsey next,\u201d Ms. Klobuchar said of the heads of state, referring to Mr. Graham, a frequent travel companion of Mr. McCain. \u201cBut he\u2019d always say, \u2018Senator Klobuchar is the Democratic lead and she\u2019ll be going next.\u2019\u201d Mr. McCain\u2019s has been a lifetime of restlessness, beginning with the childhood relocations of his Navy family and evolving into unceasing demands of \u201cwhat else?\u201d aimed at his Senate staff. But the man whose political career took flight after he fended off charges of carpetbagging \u2014 by noting the longest he had lived in one place was as a prisoner of war \u2014 has found a measure of contentment on his ranch. Mr. Biden said he was struck by how solicitous Mr. McCain was of him, inquiring about how he coped with the loss of his son Beau to brain cancer. Yet the former vice president said he was the one who hoped to impart a message. \u201cI wanted to let him know how much I love him and how much he matters to me and how much I admire his integrity and his courage,\u201d Mr. Biden said. Then he became more succinct. \u201cI wanted to see my friend,\u201d he said.",

      "content": " Updated Aug. 29, 2018 The five-day period of mourning for Senator John McCain, who died Saturday at age 81, began on Wednesday. On what would have been his 82nd birthday, Mr. McCain\u2019s remains were escorted by military honor guard to the Arizona Capitol to lie in state, where his family and Arizona politicians celebrated his life and spent time next to his coffin. Members of the public lined up outside for a general viewing throughout the afternoon. Many more Americans will turn out the rest of the week to honor and reflect on Mr. McCain\u2019s life, including former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, both of whom will speak Saturday at an invitation-only service at Washington National Cathedral. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. will speak Thursday at a funeral service in Phoenix. Members of the public will have several chances to view Mr. McCain, who will also lie in state in the United States Capitol. Here\u2019s how to pay respects. A formal memorial service will be held Thursday morning at the North Phoenix Baptist Church, which seats at least 3,000 people and is perched on a 40-acre piece of land. A limited number of tickets are available to the public. Mr. Biden, who served with Mr. McCain in the Senate for over a decade, will speak. A funeral procession through nearby streets will allow those who could not get in to the service to see Mr. McCain another way. Mr. McCain\u2019s body, moved from Arizona to Washington by military transport, will lie in state Friday in the Capitol Rotunda, where his family and former colleagues will pay tribute. More than 30 people have been honored this way, and Mr. McCain will be the 13th former senator to be granted the honor, according to the Architect of the Capitol. The morning service, where Vice President Mike Pence, Senator Mitch McConnell and Representative Paul D. Ryan are to speak, will be live-streamed. Members of the public can visit the Rotunda beginning at 2 p.m. A substantial segment of official Washington will turn out Saturday morning to a private memorial service at Washington National Cathedral, where Mr. Bush and Mr. Obama will deliver eulogies. Before he died, Mr. McCain\u2019s closest associates reportedly requested that President Trump, who has feuded with the senator, not appear at the ceremony, which will be streamed online. On the way there, Mr. McCain\u2019s motorcade will pause at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, where Cindy McCain, Mr. McCain\u2019s wife, will lay a wreath. Mr. McCain, a Vietnam War veteran, will be buried at the United States Naval Academy on Sunday next to a lifelong friend, Chuck Larson. A handwritten sign already marks the site of the grave, a \u201cbeautiful spot overlooking the Severn River,\u201d as Mr. McCain wrote in his last book, \u201cThe Restless Wave.\u201d The Navy Choir will perform \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d at the beginning of the ceremony. The academy, which he graduated from in 1958, has long been central to Mr. McCain\u2019s telling of his biography: He made one of his final public appearances there in October. \u201cI would discover that a sense of honor had been imparted to me here that would speak to me in the darkest hours,\u201d he told the Brigade of Midshipmen. \u201cAnd so I come back, again and again, to the place where I learned to dread dishonor.\u201d",

      "author": "",
      "content": "The following is the text of the remarks delivered by Sen. John McCain of Arizona at the Republican National Convention, as prepared for delivery. Thank you, Lindsey, and, thank you, my fellow Republicans. I\u2019m truly grateful for the privilege of addressing you. This week, millions of Americans, not all Republicans, weigh our claim on their support for the two men who have led our country in these challenging times with moral courage and firm resolve. So I begin with the words of a great American from the other party, given at his party\u2019s convention in the year I was born. My purpose is not imitation, for I can\u2019t match his eloquence, but respect for the relevance in our time of his rousing summons to greatness of an earlier generation of Americans. In a time of deep distress at home, as tyranny strangled the aspirations to liberty of millions, and as war clouds gathered in the West and East, Franklin Delano Roosevelt accepted his party\u2019s nomination by observing: \u201cThere is a mysterious cycle in human events. To some generations much is given. Of other generations much is expected. This generation of Americans has a rendezvous with destiny.\u201d The awful events of September 11, 2001 declared a war we were vaguely aware of, but hadn\u2019t really comprehended how near the threat was, and how terrible were the plans of our enemies. It\u2019s a big thing, this war. It\u2019s a fight between a just regard for human dignity and a malevolent force that defiles an honorable religion by disputing God\u2019s love for every soul on earth. It\u2019s a fight between right and wrong, good and evil. And should our enemies acquire for their arsenal the chemical, biological and nuclear weapons they seek, this war will become a much bigger thing. So it is, whether we wished it or not, that we have come to the test of our generation, to our rendezvous with destiny. And much is expected of us. We are engaged in a hard struggle against a cruel and determined adversary. Our enemies have made clear the danger they pose to our security and to the very essence of our culture...liberty. Only the most deluded of us could doubt the necessity of this war. Like all wars, this one will have its ups and downs. But we must fight. We must. The sacrifices borne in our defense are not shared equally by all Americans. But all Americans must share a resolve to see this war through to a just end. We must not be complacent at moments of success, and we must not despair over setbacks. We must learn from our mistakes, improve on our successes, and vanquish this unpardonable enemy. If we do less, we will fail the one mission no American generation has ever failed...to provide to our children a stronger, better country than the one we were blessed to inherit. Remember how we felt when the serenity of a bright September morning was destroyed by a savage atrocity so hostile to all human virtue we could scarcely imagine any human being capable of it. We were united. First, in sorrow and anger. Then in recognition we were attacked not for a wrong we had done, but for who we are - a people united in a kinship of ideals, committed to the notion that the people are sovereign, not governments, not armies, not a pitiless, inhumane theocracy, not kings, mullahs or tyrants, but the people. In that moment, we were not different races. We were not poor or rich. We were not Democrat or Republican, liberal or conservative. We were not two countries. We were Americans. All of us, despite the differences that enliven our politics, are united in the one big idea that freedom is our birthright and its defense is always our first responsibility. All other responsibilities come second. We must not lose sight of that as we debate who among us should bear the greatest responsibility for keeping us safe and free. We must, whatever our disagreements, stick together in this great challenge of our time. My friends in the Democratic Party - and I\u2019m fortunate to call many of them my friends - assure us they share the conviction that winning the war against terrorism is our government\u2019s most important obligation. I don\u2019t doubt their sincerity. They emphasize that military action alone won\u2019t protect us, that this war has many fronts: in courts, financial institutions, in the shadowy world of intelligence, and in diplomacy. They stress that America needs the help of her friends to combat an evil that threatens us all, that our alliances are as important to victory as are our armies. We agree. And, as we\u2019ve been a good friend to other countries in moments of shared perils, so we have good reason to expect their solidarity with us in this struggle. That is what the President believes. And, thanks to his efforts we have received valuable assistance from many good friends around the globe, even if we have, at times, been disappointed with the reactions of some. I don\u2019t doubt the sincerity of my Democratic friends. And they should not doubt ours. Our President will work with all nations willing to help us defeat this scourge that afflicts us all. War is an awful business. The lives of a nation\u2019s finest patriots are sacrificed. Innocent people suffer. Commerce is disrupted, economies are damaged. Strategic interests shielded by years of statecraft are endangered as the demands of war and diplomacy conflict. However just the cause, we should shed a tear for all that is lost when war claims its wages from us. But there is no avoiding this war. We tried that, and our reluctance cost us dearly. And while this war has many components, we can\u2019t make victory on the battlefield harder to achieve so that our diplomacy is easier to conduct. That is not just an expression of our strength. It\u2019s a measure of our wisdom. That\u2019s why I commend to my country the re-election of President Bush, and the steady, experienced, public-spirited man who serves as our Vice-President, Dick Cheney. Four years ago, in Philadelphia, I spoke of my confidence that President Bush would accept the responsibilities that come with America\u2019s distinction as the world\u2019s only superpower. I promised he would not let America \u201cretreat behind empty threats, false promises and uncertain diplomacy;\u201d that he would \u201cconfidently defend our interests and values wherever they are threatened.\u201d I knew my confidence was well placed when I watched him stand on the rubble of the World Trade Center, with his arm around a hero of September 11th, and in our moment of mourning and anger, strengthen our unity and summon our resolve by promising to right this terrible wrong, and to stand up and fight for the values we hold dear. He promised our enemies would soon hear from us. And so they did. So they did. He ordered American forces to Afghanistan and took the fight to our enemies, and away from our shores, seriously injuring al Qaeda and destroying the regime that gave them safe haven. He worked effectively to secure the cooperation of Pakistan, a relationship that\u2019s critical to our success against al Qaeda. He encouraged other friends to recognize the peril that terrorism posed for them, and won their help in apprehending many of those who would attack us again, and in helping to freeze the assets they used to fund their bloody work. After years of failed diplomacy and limited military pressure to restrain Saddam Hussein, President Bush made the difficult decision to liberate Iraq. Those who criticize that decision would have us believe that the choice was between a status quo that was well enough left alone and war. But there was no status quo to be left alone. The years of keeping Saddam in a box were coming to a close. The international consensus that he be kept isolated and unarmed had eroded to the point that many critics of military action had decided the time had come again to do business with Saddam, despite his near daily attacks on our pilots, and his refusal, until his last day in power, to allow the unrestricted inspection of his arsenal. Our choice wasn\u2019t between a benign status quo and the bloodshed of war. It was between war and a graver threat. Don\u2019t let anyone tell you otherwise. Not our critics abroad. Not our political opponents. And certainly not a disingenuous film maker who would have us believe that Saddam\u2019s Iraq was an oasis of peace when in fact it was a place of indescribable cruelty, torture chambers, mass graves and prisons that destroyed the lives of the small children held inside their walls. Whether or not Saddam possessed the terrible weapons he once had and used, freed from international pressure and the threat of military action, he would have acquired them again. The central security concern of our time is to keep such devastating weapons beyond the reach of terrorists who can\u2019t be dissuaded from using them by the threat of mutual destruction. We couldn\u2019t afford the risk posed by an unconstrained Saddam in these dangerous times. By destroying his regime we gave hope to people long oppressed that if they have the courage to fight for it, they may live in peace and freedom. Most importantly, our efforts may encourage the people of a region that has never known peace or freedom or lasting stability that they may someday possess these rights. I believe as strongly today as ever, the mission was necessary, achievable and noble. For his determination to undertake it, and for his unflagging resolve to see it through to a just end, President Bush deserves not only our support, but our admiration. As the President rightly reminds us, we are safer than we were on September 11th, but we\u2019re not yet safe. We are still closer to the beginning than the end of this fight. We need a leader with the experience to make the tough decisions and the resolve to stick with them; a leader who will keep us moving forward even if it is easier to rest. And this President will not rest until America is stronger and safer still, and this hateful iniquity is vanquished. He has been tested and has risen to the most important challenge of our time, and I salute him. I salute his determination to make this world a better, safer, freer place. He has not wavered. He has not flinched from the hard choices. He will not yield. And neither will we. I said earlier that the sacrifices in this war will not be shared equally by all Americans. The President is the first to observe, most of the sacrifices fall, as they have before, to the brave men and women of our Armed Forces. We may be good citizens, but make no mistake, they are the very best of us. It\u2019s an honor to live in a country that is so well and so bravely defended by such patriots. May God bless them, the living and the fallen, as He has blessed us with their service. For their families, for their friends, for America, for mankind they sacrifice to affirm that right makes might; that good triumphs over evil; that freedom is stronger than tyranny; that love is greater than hate. It is left to us to keep their generous benefaction alive, and our blessed, beautiful country worthy of their courage. We should be thankful -- for the privilege. Our country\u2019s security doesn\u2019t depend on the heroism of every citizen. But we have to be worthy of the sacrifices made on our behalf. We have to love our freedom, not just for the material benefits it provides, not just for the autonomy it guarantees us, but for the goodness it makes possible. We have to love it as much, if not as heroically, as the brave Americans who defend us at the risk, and often the cost of their lives. No American alive today will ever forget what happened on the morning of September 11th. That day was the moment when the pendulum of history swung toward a new era. The opening chapter was tinged with great sadness and uncertainty. It shook us from our complacency in the belief that the Cold War\u2019s end had ushered in a time of global tranquility. But an absence of complacency should not provoke an absence of confidence. What our enemies have sought to destroy is beyond their reach. It cannot be taken from us. It can only be surrendered. My friends, we are again met on the field of political competition with our fellow countrymen. It is more than appropriate, it is necessary that even in times of crisis we have these contests, and engage in spirited disagreement over the shape and course of our government. We have nothing to fear from each other. We are arguing over the means to better secure our freedom, and promote the general welfare. But it should remain an argument among friends who share an unshaken belief in our great cause, and in the goodness of each other. We are Americans first, Americans last, Americans always. Let us argue our differences. But remember we are not enemies, but comrades in a war against a real enemy, and take courage from the knowledge that our military superiority is matched only by the superiority of our ideals, and our unconquerable love for them. Our adversaries are weaker than us in arms and men, but weaker still in causes. They fight to express a hatred for all that is good in humanity. We fight for love of freedom and justice, a love that is invincible. Keep that faith. Keep your courage. Stick together. Stay strong. Do not yield. Do not flinch. Stand up. Stand up with our President and fight. We\u2019re Americans. We\u2019re Americans, and we\u2019ll never surrender. They will.",

      "author": "Carl Hulse",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 The circumstances are eerily similar. In the middle of contentious health care deliberations, a larger-than-life figure in the Senate learns he has a very serious form of brain cancer. A leading voice goes quiet and the Senate suffers for it. Such was the case in 2008 when Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, learned he had brain cancer and again this week when it was announced that John McCain, Republican of Arizona, had the exact condition that claimed his colleague \u2014 a man who shared Mr. McCain\u2019s zest for a good argument and for cutting a deal. \u201cThere are some very strong parallels,\u201d said Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, who serves as the top Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, which Mr. McCain is the chairman of. As colleagues of Mr. McCain from both parties acknowledged the vital role he has played in an institution where he is a dominant personality, they also said that his remarkable life story, most notably enduring torture for more than five years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, made them believe he would return. \u201cI think there is a great sense of confidence that with such a determined individual, I am sure he is going to be back,\u201d Mr. Reed said. Mr. McCain sought to reinforce that view on Twitter on Thursday, weighing in after Democrats and Republicans shared thoughts and well wishes that he might have thought sounded too much like they were saying goodbye. \u201cI greatly appreciate the outpouring of support \u2014 unfortunately for my sparring partners in Congress, I\u2019ll be back soon, so standby!\u201d he wrote. But he is gone for the moment for treatment of the brain cancer, diagnosed as a glioblastoma, and his absence will create a void in both the spirit of the Senate and the legislative agenda. While he is away, Mr. McCain leaves Senate Republicans one vote down in their narrow majority at a time when they are trying to produce some legislative results, including progress on a repeal of the Affordable Care Act. In addition, the Senate was to begin deliberating the annual Pentagon policy measure drafted by Mr. McCain and his committee, and lawmakers say it is doubtful they will move quickly to do that without the bill\u2019s chief architect present. Fellow senators said the impact on legislation was secondary at the moment. \u201cThis is a time you don\u2019t look at how it affects agendas,\u201d said Senator Richard M. Burr, the North Carolina Republican whose office adjoins Mr. McCain\u2019s in the Russell Senate Office Building. \u201cYou look at the contribution that John makes and what a loss that would be not to have him here.\u201d Mr. McCain has been a power player on Capitol Hill for decades, working on some of the most contentious issues in a polarized Congress, sometimes as a leader of one of the Senate \u201cgangs\u201d that form to find a consensus solution. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is a gang to solve a problem he hasn\u2019t been a part of,\u201d said John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate. But it was Mr. Kennedy, the fiercely liberal Democrat, whom Mr. McCain often saw as his partner and peer in the Senate, two men not afraid of raising their voices to make a point in the chamber but working cooperatively behind closed doors to keep the pressure on their colleagues to make a deal, as they tried to do on immigration. When Mr. Kennedy received his diagnosis in May 2008, it shook Mr. McCain. When Mr. Kennedy died 15 months later, Mr. McCain delivered a memorable eulogy at a memorial service in Boston. \u201cHe was good company, my friend Ted,\u201d Mr. McCain said. Once Mr. Kennedy began treatment he was seen rarely in the Senate, staying away because his weakened immune system made him vulnerable to infection. He made a dramatic appearance in July 2008 to help Democrats break a filibuster by Republicans on a Medicare bill. Mr. McCain seems determined to remain engaged in Senate activities. Senator Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina Republican who is Mr. McCain\u2019s closest ally in the Senate, said at a news conference on Thursday that Mr. McCain had already called him three times since the morning. \u201cHe is yelling to me to buck up, so I\u2019m going to buck up,\u201d said Mr. Graham, who said he would like to deliver a victory on immigration legislation in tribute to Mr. McCain. Noting the bipartisan outpouring of good wishes, love and respect for Mr. McCain, Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, said it might potentially be a good omen for the Senate and for Washington. \u201cBehind the meanness of politics, there are some beating hearts and caring people,\u201d Mr. Durbin said. \u201cI hope this just brings us back to a more humane approach in his name and to honor all the great work he has done here.\u201d The sentiment for Mr. McCain, who struggles to control an occasionally quick temper and is not shy about making his opinions known, was so strong that colleagues said they would even miss his barbs while he was away. \u201cHe means a lot to the Senate, and his willingness to take on people and issues puts everyone on notice,\u201d said Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri. \u201cHe has that Navy guy ability where the worse he insults you, the better you like it.\u201d Senator Jon Tester, Democrat of Montana, was reminded of a moment when Mr. Kennedy was stricken. \u201cJohn Kerry said when Ted Kennedy got sick that this place won\u2019t be the same,\u201d Mr. Tester said. \u201cSame goes for John McCain.\u201d His colleagues are now hoping anxiously that they don\u2019t have to find out what the Senate would be like without the presence of the senior senator from Arizona.",

      "author": "Alan Rappeport",
      "content": " Senator John McCain, the 2008 Republican presidential nominee, withdrew his support on Saturday for Donald J. Trump as the Republican Party descended into chaos. On Friday, a recording was released showing Mr. Trump speaking about women in lewd and degrading terms. Though he faced calls from many in his party to step aside, Mr. Trump vowed in an interview that he would \u201cnever drop out of this race in a million years.\u201d He later took a stronger stance on Twitter. Ms. Trump said in a statement on Saturday that although his words about women were \u201cunacceptable and offensive\u201d to her, she hoped that \u201cpeople will accept his apology, as I have, and focus on the important issues facing our nation and the world.\u201d Mr. Trump showed up just before 5 p.m. in the lobby of Trump Tower in Manhattan, accompanied by his campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, and his eldest child, Donald Trump Jr. Security officials stopped reporters and attempted to bar them from getting near Mr. Trump as he went outside and immersed himself in a crowd of supporters, who had gathered hours earlier for a rally. \u201cHundred percent,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters who yelled questions about whether he would stay in the race. He ignored other questions about his response to the defections by Republicans. Separately, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers, Rudolph W. Giuliani, a former mayor of New York City, was seen on CNN getting into a car outside Trump Tower, which he had earlier entered for planned debate preparation sessions. \u201cThere is nothing that will cause his dropping out,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said. \u201cThat is wishful thinking of the Clinton campaign and those who have opposed him for a long time.\u201d Robert and Rebekah Mercer, the Republican megadonors who previously supported Senator Ted Cruz, suggested Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks were irrelevant to the race. \u201cIf Mr. Trump had told Billy Bush, whoever that is, earlier this year that he was for open borders, open trade and executive actions in pursuit of gun control, we would certainly be rethinking our support for him,\u201d they said in a statement. The Mercers also compared Mr. Trump\u2019s actions to Bill Clinton\u2019s treatment of women. The tactic is a favorite of Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters, including Sean Hannity, the Fox News host, who devoted most of his show on Friday evening to allegations of abuse by Mr. Clinton. \u2022 Condoleezza Rice, the secretary of state under President George W. Bush, who has generally has not discussed politics since becoming a private citizen, called for Mr. Trump to leave the race. She said she hoped to support someone who has the dignity and stature to be president. \u201cEnough!\u201d Ms. Rice said in a Facebook post. \u201cDonald Trump should not be President. He should withdraw.\u201d \u2022 Mr. McCain, who has criticized Mr. Trump repeatedly, officially withdrew his backing. \u201cI have wanted to support the candidate our party nominated,\u201d he said in a statement. He added: \u201cBut Donald Trump\u2019s behavior this week, concluding with the disclosure of his demeaning comments about women and his boasts about sexual assaults, make it impossible to continue to offer even conditional support for his candidacy.\u201d \u2022 House Speaker Paul D. Ryan said he was \u201csickened\u201d by Mr. Trump\u2019s behavior and disinvited him from a Saturday event in Wisconsin. There, he referred obliquely to the episode. \u201cThere is an elephant in the room. That is not what we are here to talk about today.\u201d (Here\u2019s how Mr. Ryan and Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, have condemned Mr. Trump in past statements.) \u2022 Former primary opponents such as Carly Fiorina and Gov. John Kasich of Ohio said Mr. Trump should stand down. Mr. Kasich declared that the warning signs were right and that he would never vote for Mr. Trump. \u2022 Mr. Trump\u2019s most strident defender, his running mate, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, called the remarks from the 2005 video indefensible. \u2022 We are also tallying the number of Republican leaders who say they won\u2019t vote for Mr. Trump. Experts say that swapping out a presidential nominee at this stage of the game would be virtually impossible unless Mr. Trump dies, becomes incapacitated or decides to quit. Trying to change the Republican National Committee\u2019s rules with so little time until Election Day would be a logistical nightmare, and those rules do not give the party the power to change the nominee because people are unhappy. If Mr. Trump did decide to drop out, the logistics would also be challenging because ballots have been printed and voting has already started in many places. We break it down in our Q. and A. Still, as unlikely as that scenario appears to be, that remains the best hope for finding a new nominee. The showdown between Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton on Sunday night takes on even greater importance after Mr. Trump\u2019s latest controversy. Unless he speaks beforehand, it will be his first chance to publicly take questions about his behavior on the recording. The audience could approach 100 million. Many Republicans who have yet to denounce Mr. Trump have suggested that the debate will be a make-or-break moment for him. Take a look.",

      "author": "Carl Hulse",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 John McCain on Friday made his final visit to the Capitol he ruled as a commanding presence for more than three decades to be grieved and celebrated by colleagues past and present. He would have loved it. Much of official Washington joined current members of Congress and dozens of former colleagues from the House and Senate under the Capitol dome to pay tribute to the late senator, congressman, war hero and failed but proud presidential contender. The service was imbued with the dignity, seriousness and respect \u2014 as well as the capacity to embrace with affection someone of a different political ideology \u2014 that are so lacking in American politics these days. And that seemed to be the point. Mr. McCain\u2019s death is giving Americans \u2014 even those who might have disagreed strenuously with him \u2014 an opportunity to recognize someone for a selfless life of service to his country at a time when many are disillusioned and dispirited about politics in both substance and tone. \u201cA lot of people in the country are looking for a person who can be held up as an exemplary public servant,\u201d said John E. Sununu, a former Republican senator from New Hampshire, in giving his view of why Mr. McCain\u2019s death is resonating so strongly across the country. President Trump was not welcome at the event, and his glaring absence was strongly felt. No one had to say it aloud, but the days-long national farewell for Mr. McCain has taken on the distinct feel of a sharp counterpoint to Mr. Trump \u2014 an outpouring of appreciation for a unique political figure, a political rival whom Mr. Trump belittled and whose record of service he initially failed to acknowledge upon his death. \u201cI prayed at the coffin that our nation live up to his integrity, honesty and idealism,\u201d Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said after the emotional service, which left some of Mr. McCain\u2019s closest colleagues drained. As Mr. McCain himself often said, he was not without his flaws. But he was a public figure who pursued his goals with principle and an intensity that his colleagues envied. They assembled in recognition of his special stature. \u201cMany of us wish we had the courage to have played the role John McCain played,\u201d said Connie Mack III, a Florida Republican who entered the House with Mr. McCain in 1983 and later served with him in the Senate. There was no small amount of political intrigue at the ceremony as those attending noted carefully who was on hand from the Trump administration \u2014 Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a former senator now under intense fire from the president; Rod J. Rosenstein, the No. 2 at the Justice Department and the official responsible for the special counsel inquiry; the chief of staff, John F. Kelly; the president\u2019s counselor, Kellyanne Conway; and a retinue of national security officials whose ties to Mr. McCain go much deeper than with Mr. Trump. Many on hand stole glimpses of the Trump officials as the ceremony proceeded. \u201cWhat a lot of drama,\u201d said one current senator who preferred not to be named discussing the atmospherics of such a solemn event. But that was another aspect of the service that would have appealed to Mr. McCain, himself the instigator of much Capitol Hill drama over the years. Vice President Mike Pence, who in his job also serves as president of the Senate, represented the White House and took pains to point out that \u201cthe president asked me to be here on behalf of a grateful nation to pay a debt of honor and respect to a man who served our country throughout his life, in uniform and in public office.\u201d Mr. Pence also managed to work in a plug for tax cuts by commending Mr. McCain \u2014 whom Mr. Pence worked with as a House member to ban earmarks and instill some fiscal discipline \u2014 noting that his support for \u201climited government, for tax reform, and support for our armed forces surely left our nation more prosperous and more secure.\u201d But it was left to Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican and majority leader, and Speaker Paul D. Ryan to convey the deep admiration of most in Congress for Mr. McCain \u2014 though not without the de rigueur acknowledgment of Mr. McCain\u2019s famous temper and the difficulties he could present when others were trying to coax him into a compromise. \u201cHe treated every issue with the intensity the people\u2019s business deserved,\u201d said Mr. McConnell, who clashed fiercely with Mr. McCain over changes in campaign finance law but reconciled with him in recent years. \u201cHe would fight tooth and nail for his vision of the common good. Depending on the issue, you knew John would either be your staunchest ally or your most stubborn opponent.\u201d \u201cI will miss a dear friend whose smile reminded us that service is a privilege,\u201d Mr. McConnell said, \u201cand whose scars reminded us of the great cost that brave souls pay for our freedom.\u201d Mr. Ryan remembered his own fights with Mr. McCain, recounting that \u201cwith John it was never feigned disagreements. The man didn\u2019t feign anything. He just relished the fight.\u201d \u201cThough the highest office eluded him,\u201d Mr. Ryan said, \u201che attained what is far more enduring, the abiding affection of his fellow citizens and an example for future generations.\u201d The line of admirers that formed outside the Capitol in scorching heat for the chance to pass by Mr. McCain\u2019s coffin clearly underscored how he had won the affection of citizens who, for a few days at least, had their faith in the spirit of public service renewed.",

      "author": "Sarah Mervosh",
      "content": "  President Trump offered his \u201cdeepest sympathies and respect\u201d to the family of Senator John McCain on Saturday night, setting aside a yearslong, bitter and often deeply personal feud between the two men that had lasted into the senator\u2019s final days. The president shared his condolences in a tweet, shortly after it was announced that Mr. McCain, who had been battling brain cancer, had died. \u201cOur hearts and prayers are with you!\u201d he said. The White House flag was lowered to half-staff on Saturday night in honor of Mr. McCain. Michael Glassner, the chief operating officer of Donald J. Trump for President, said in a statement on Saturday that the campaign offered its condolences. \u201cWe encourage all Americans to take the opportunity to remember Senator McCain and his family in their prayers on this sad occasion,\u201d the statement said. But as former presidents and other politicians from both parties lauded Mr. McCain\u2019s character and patriotism, Mr. Trump\u2019s brief comment focused on the family of the Republican senator from Arizona. Though of the same generation and political party, the two men had expressed a mutual distaste for one another since Mr. Trump catapulted onto the political scene as a candidate for president in 2015. [Read the obituary for John McCain, who endured five years of captivity in Vietnam and rose to the heights of power in Washington] Mr. McCain, a former prisoner of war in Vietnam who rose to power as a prominent Republican politician, emerged as an early and vocal critic from within Mr. Trump\u2019s own party. He condemned Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks about women, illegal immigrants and the family of a slain Muslim Army captain during the presidential campaign. He withdrew support for Mr. Trump about a month before Election Day after a recording was released on which Mr. Trump spoke about groping women. At one point, Mr. Trump, who received draft deferments and had never served in the military, belittled Mr. McCain\u2019s war record. \u201cHe\u2019s not a war hero,\u201d Mr. Trump said at a Republican presidential forum in Iowa in 2015. \u201cHe\u2019s a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren\u2019t captured.\u201d Once Mr. Trump entered the Oval Office, Mr. McCain generally supported the administration\u2019s policies and nominees, including a $1.5 trillion tax cut and the confirmation of Justice Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. But in key moments, the senator remained a forceful adversary, and neither man yielded as Mr. McCain battled terminal illness. Mr. McCain thwarted a Republican effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act last year, returning to the Senate floor after his brain cancer diagnosis to cast a dramatic thumbs-down vote. More recently, Mr. McCain issued a statement critical of Mr. Trump\u2019s summit meeting in Helsinki, Finland, with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia calling it \u201cone of the most disgraceful performances by an American president in memory.\u201d This month, as Mr. McCain was ailing, President Trump gave a 28-minute speech about a bill named for Mr. McCain \u2014 but did not mention the senator at all. Elsewhere, Mr. McCain\u2019s long military and political history \u2014 and his willingness to at times defy the Republican agenda \u2014 won him praise from both parties at the end of his life. President Barack Obama, who defeated Mr. McCain in the 2008 presidential election, said in a statement on Saturday night that \u201cwe shared, for all our differences, a fidelity to something higher \u2014 the ideals for which generations of Americans and immigrants alike have fought, marched and sacrificed.\u201d Mr. Obama also alluded to Mr. McCain\u2019s military service, saying: \u201cAll of us can aspire to the courage to put the greater good above our own. At John\u2019s best, he showed us what that means. And for that, we are all in his debt.\u201d Including Mr. Obama, every living former president released statements commemorating Mr. McCain. President George W. Bush, who won the Republican nomination for president over Mr. McCain in 2000, said in his statement: \u201cSome lives are so vivid, it is difficult to imagine them ended. Some voices are so vibrant it is hard to imagine them stilled.\u201d Vice President Mike Pence, in his own statement on Twitter, honored Mr. McCain\u2019s \u201clifetime of service to this nation in our military and in public life.\u201d \u201cGod bless John McCain,\u201d he said.",

      "content": " Facing perhaps the most difficult re-election of his career, Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, is getting an early start against Representative Ann Kirkpatrick, the likely Democratic candidate in the race, with a new television ad hitting her for her strong support of the Affordable Care Act. The advertisement, Mr. McCain\u2019s first television ad of the election cycle, began airing on Tuesday on network affiliates in Phoenix. It replays an interview in which Ms. Kirkpatrick declares that the health care law is the vote she is most proud of, while recounting problems with the new insurance coverage in Arizona, including premium increases and the withdrawal from the plan by a major insurer. \u201cWhile Kirkpatrick\u2019s proud of putting us at risk, John McCain is leading the fight to stop Obamacare,\u201d the female announcer says. Mr. McCain\u2019s campaign has also established a new website hitting his Republican primary opponent Kelli Ward, a former state legislator, for various provocative statements and actions, leaving Mr. McCain punching in two directions. The primary election is not until Aug. 30, and Mr. McCain\u2019s decision to start attacking Ms. Kirkpatrick shows he is not willing to risk her getting a free pass until then. Aware that Mr. McCain is increasingly seen as vulnerable in his fight for a sixth term, his campaign team issued a memo this week noting his sizable fund-raising advantage and extensive grass-roots organizing efforts.",

      "content": " PHOENIX \u2014 Senator John McCain on Tuesday survived one of the most bruising election seasons of his long political career, fending off a challenge from his Democratic rival, Representative Ann Kirkpatrick, to secure a sixth term representing Arizona in Washington. Mr. McCain, 80, weathered a revolt from the right within the Republican Party. And he found himself in an awkward relationship with Donald J. Trump, who last year mocked Mr. McCain\u2019s military service and years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, saying: \u201cHe was a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren\u2019t captured.\u201d Mr. McCain nonetheless endorsed Mr. Trump, justifying his decision not as a personal choice but as a matter of respect for his party. His support was fleeting. He withdrew it last month, prompted, he said, by Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cdemeaning comments about women and his boasts about sexual assaults.\u201d Ms. Kirkpatrick, 66, embraced the positions pushed by Hillary Clinton, banking on support from Latino voters, moderate independent voters and disaffected middle-of-the-road Republicans to propel her to victory. Mr. McCain was buoyed by a deep campaign war chest and by help from the Republican establishment. Last week, Mitt Romney, the party\u2019s nominee in 2012, stumped for him in Arizona. Mr. McCain seized on Ms. Kirkpatrick\u2019s support of President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act as a main point of attack. In ads, his campaign assailed her for calling her vote for the program her \u201cproudest moment\u201d in Congress and declared her \u201ctoo liberal for Arizona.\u201d",

      "author": "Liam Stack",
      "content": " John McCain, who died on Saturday at the age of 81, was a national figure whose decades of public service and distinctive public persona made him a larger-than-life figure in the increasingly polarized world of American politics. Mr. McCain was frequently referred to as a \u201cmaverick,\u201d an image he cultivated to advance his political goals, including two failed presidential runs. After those defeats, he became known as a conservative lion of the Senate, who \u2014 despite his famous temper \u2014 believed that partisan disputes and civility could coexist in Washington. [Read the obituary for John McCain.] Here is a look at Mr. McCain\u2019s public history. Mr. McCain became a high-profile prisoner of war after his Navy plane was shot down over Hanoi in 1967. The son of the commander of American forces in the Pacific, he was held in North Vietnam\u2019s \u201cHanoi Hilton\u201d prison complex for five and a half years. Injuries he suffered at the hands of torturers left him with lifelong physical disabilities, but Mr. McCain turned down an offer of early release because he did not want to harm morale among his fellow prisoners or give North Vietnam a propaganda coup. He was released in 1973. Decades later, as a United States senator, he helped normalize American diplomatic relations with Vietnam. In 1999, as Mr. McCain embarked on his first presidential run, rumors about possible psychological damage from Vietnam helped prompt the release of his medical records. A doctor who examined him shortly after his release had written that Mr. McCain had \u201cadjusted exceptionally well to repatriation.\u201d Mr. McCain moved to Arizona in 1981, where he won a seat in the House of Representatives in 1982 and the Senate in 1986. He became known as an independently minded conservative, but his involvement in the Keating Five savings-and-loan scandal nearly ended his career. In the wake of the scandal, Mr. McCain made campaign finance reform one of his signature issues. For several years, he worked alongside Senator Russ Feingold, a liberal Democrat from Wisconsin, to pass the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002. Also known as the McCain-Feingold Act, it banned large campaign contributions to national party committees but permitted them to outside groups. [John McCain was one of the last lions of the Senate, our chief Washington correspondent writes.] Mr. McCain\u2019s long-shot campaign for the Republican presidential nomination in 2000 was propelled largely by his reputation for personal integrity and candor (he called his campaign bus \u201cthe Straight Talk Express\u201d). But it fell apart after a brutal and racially charged primary fight in South Carolina. A smear campaign in South Carolina claimed that Mr. McCain\u2019s adopted Bangladeshi daughter, Bridget, was the product of an extramarital affair between him and a black woman. It also questioned his sexuality, his mental health and whether he had committed treason in North Vietnam. The whisper campaign helped George W. Bush gain an edge over Mr. McCain, although he denied involvement in the attacks. Mr. McCain dropped out of the race in March 2000 after his loss in South Carolina was compounded by a string of disappointments on Super Tuesday. Mr. McCain won his party\u2019s presidential nomination in 2008 but failed to match the charisma of the Democratic candidate, Barack Obama, and to respond to the outbreak of the financial crisis that spawned the great recession. He chose Sarah Palin, then the Alaska governor, as his running mate, a bid to inject energy into his campaign that backfired. Ms. Palin\u2019s inexperience raised questions about Mr. McCain\u2019s judgment and highlighted the fact that at 71 he would have been the oldest president to take office. Mr. McCain\u2019s decision to give a national platform to Ms. Palin contributed to the rise of the Tea Party movement and the emergence of grievance politics and nativism as drivers of the Republican Party. In a 2018 memoir, he wrote that he regretted the decision to pick her. Tea Party anger and opposition to President Obama moved the Republican Party to the right, and after 2008 Mr. McCain moved with it. His positions on issues like border security and climate change hardened in the face of a right-wing primary challenger, and he won re-election in 2010. But he returned to bipartisanship as the political environment became more polarized. He worked with a bipartisan group of senators, known as the Gang of Eight, in a failed push for immigration reform and opposed Republican efforts to change the Affordable Care Act by threatening a government shutdown. Mr. McCain had a strained relationship with Donald J. Trump, who mocked his military service and time as a prisoner of war when he told an audience in 2015: \u201cHe is a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren\u2019t captured.\u201d Mr. McCain endorsed Mr. Trump in 2016, saying he would respect the will of primary voters, but withdrew that endorsement after a video surfaced on which Mr. Trump bragged about sexual assault. Mr. McCain said that neither he nor his wife would vote for Mr. Trump. Relations between the two men remained rocky for the rest of Mr. McCain\u2019s life. Mr. Trump frequently criticized him at rallies for his decisive vote against a Republican plan to replace the Affordable Care Act, which he revealed with a dramatic thumbs down on the Senate floor. On Saturday night, Mr. Trump offered his \u201cdeepest sympathies and respect\u201d to the McCain family.",

      "content": "     \u2022 Senator John McCain received a full-fledged Washington send-off on Saturday as former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama led an invitation-only service at Washington National Cathedral. \u2022 A motorcade carrying Mr. McCain\u2019s coffin left Capitol Hill around 8:40 a.m. and stopped along the way at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, where Cindy McCain laid a wreath in honor of her husband, a naval aviator who was held for five and a half years as a prisoner of war. \u2022 The memorial service at the Cathedral began shortly after 10 a.m. Meghan McCain, one of his daughters, delivered an emotional tribute to her father that included a steely rebuke to President Trump. Former Senator Joseph Lieberman, independent of Connecticut, and former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger also made remarks. After the formal remarks by the former presidents and the other speakers, the service wrapped up with readings by Sidney McCain, another daughter of the senator, former Senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire and Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and a homily by the Rev. Edward A. Reese. Ren\u00e9e Fleming, the famed opera singer, then performed \u201cDanny Boy,\u201d and the audience joined in the Lord\u2019s Prayer and \u201cAmerica the Beautiful.\u201d Mr. McCain\u2019s flag-draped coffin was escorted out of the cathedral by 15 honorary pallbearers representing a who\u2019s who of the senator\u2019s friends and colleagues from both sides of the aisle, including former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York, the actor Warren Beatty and a plethora of current and former senators and cabinet secretaries from both parties. Also among the pallbearers was Vladimir Kara-Murza, a prominent Russian dissident, a choice meant to symbolize Mr. McCain\u2019s unflinching opposition to the authoritarian government of President Vladimir V. Putin. Among the invited guests elsewhere in the cathedral was Bill Browder, the investor who championed legislation that Mr. McCain helped sponsor to punish Russia for human rights abuses. Echoing the words of his predecessor, former President Barack Obama recalled Mr. McCain\u2019s mischievous streak, his passion and his frequent sparring with people he disagreed with. \u201cWhat better way to get a last laugh than make George and I say nice things about him to a national audience?\u201d Mr. Obama said as Mr. Bush laughed along with the rest of the audience. Mr. McCain\u2019s critiques, he said, made both men better presidents. And like Mr. Bush, Mr. Obama did not mention the absent president by name, but delivered an implicit censure of Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration policies and attacks on the press. \u201cHe understood that if we get in the habit of bending the truth to suit political expediency or party orthodoxy, our democracy will not work,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cSo much of our politics, our public life, our public discourse, can seem small and mean and petty, trafficking in bombast and insult, in phony controversies and manufactured outrage,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cIt\u2019s a politics that pretends to be brave, but in fact is born of fear. John called us to be bigger than that. He called us to be better than that.\u201d [Read Barack Obama\u2019s eulogy for John McCain.] Former President George W. Bush reflected on a political rivalry with Mr. McCain during the campaign for the 2000 Republican presidential nomination, a rivalry that later became camaraderie. \u201cIn the end, I got to enjoy one of life\u2019s great gifts, the friendship of John McCain,\u201d Mr. Bush said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll miss it.\u201d Mr. Bush did not mention the current president, but his tribute carried an undeniable contrast with the current administration\u2019s policies. \u201cHe respected the dignity inherent in every life, a dignity that does not stop at borders and cannot be erased by dictators,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was honorable, always recognizing that his opponents were still patriots and human beings.\u201d [Read George W. Bush\u2019s eulogy for John McCain.] The service began with Meghan McCain delivering an emotional tribute to her father through tears, one that included a steely rebuke to her father\u2019s most prominent critic \u2014 President Trump, who had spent the morning talking about himself and his administration on Twitter. \u201cWe gather to mourn the passing of American greatness, the real thing, not cheap rhetoric from men who will never come near the sacrifice he gave so willingly,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was a great fire who burned bright,\u201d she added. \u201cA few have resented that fire for that light it cast upon them, for the truth it revealed about their character, but my father never cared what they thought. And even that small number still have the opportunity, as long as they draw breath, to live up to the example of John McCain.\u201d Her voice strengthened as she described her father\u2019s America, explicitly contradicting the president. \u201cAmerica does not boast, because she has no need to,\u201d she said to applause. \u201cThe America of John McCain has no need to be made great again because America was always great.\u201d As Henry A. Kissinger, the former secretary of state and national security adviser, began recalling Mr. McCain\u2019s years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, Mr. Trump continued to post on Twitter, switching his focus to Canada and the North American Free Trade Agreement. He said there was \u201cno political necessity\u201d to keep Canada in a newly negotiated deal with Mexico. He warned that Congress should not interfere with the negotiations, or he would \u201csimply terminate NAFTA entirely & we will be far better off.\u201d \u201cRemember,\u201d he added, \u201cNAFTA was one of the WORST Trade Deals ever made.\u201d Mr. Trump was en route to his golf course in Virginia. Ivanka Trump, his eldest daughter and senior adviser, was in attendance at Mr. McCain\u2019s funeral, along with other senior members of his administration. In the final moments of Meghan McCain\u2019s eulogy, Mr. Trump took off in a motorcade from the White House, destination unknown but presumably his golf course in Virginia. According to reporters traveling with Mr. Trump, \u201cthe president is wearing a white shirt-sleeved shirt and white MAGA hat\u201d \u2014 the very slogan that Meghan McCain took aim at in her eulogy. In the week since Mr. McCain\u2019s death, his closest friends have been recalling their favorite, private moments with him. For John Lehman, the former Navy secretary, one of them came shortly before Mr. McCain received the diagnosis of brain cancer that would eventually take his life. On the weekend of June 14, 2017, Mr. McCain, Mr. Lehman and three other friends secretly escaped Washington for a three-day dining and gambling trip to Monaco, the place where Mr. McCain had first learned to play craps while on shore leave from the Intrepid in 1961. Mr. Lehman recalled how the small group was greeted by Prince Albert and Princess Caroline \u2014 the leaders of the tiny principality and longtime friends of the senator. Past midnight, after a long meal at the palace, with a lot of wine and a leisurely tour, Mr. Lehman said the group \u2014 which included Rick Davis, a former campaign chairman; Steve Duprey, a New Hampshire businessman; and Steve Wynn, a Las Vegas casino magnate \u2014 prepared to head to their hotel. \u201cThe hell with the hotel. We\u2019re going to the casino,\u201d Mr. McCain said, according to Mr. Lehman. For more than four hours, Mr. McCain stood at a craps table, merrily placing bets and rolling the dice as he occasionally paused to take a selfie with admirers. In the end, they finally pulled him away from the table after 4 a.m., having won \u20ac900. \u201cHe was really happy,\u201d Mr. Lehman recalled fondly. As the McCain family, led by Ms. McCain, filed out of the motorcade and walked in front of the cathedral, the dull hum of noise at the scene went silent. The family watched pallbearers carry the flag-draped coffin up the steps and into the cathedral and quietly followed, heads bowed. Split screen: Minutes after a somber-looking Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner entered the cathedral, the sizable McCain funeral procession pulled up. As a hearse carrying Mr. McCain\u2019s flag-draped coffin pulled up to the cathedral, the church\u2019s bells played a rendition of \u201cAmerica the Beautiful.\u201d The proceedings played out against gray skies and were punctuated by the angry tweets of a president who had not been invited. Back at the White House, Mr. Trump refrained through midmorning from leaving for his usual trip to his golf club, and instead tweeted about the Steele dossier, President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. He also shared a favorable review of his administration just as the hearse carrying Mr. McCain arrived. The president was not alone in his desire to publicly squabble over partisan politics as the McCain family followed their patriarch into the cathedral. A tweet sent by Senator Chuck Schumer, the New York Democrat, angrily accused Republicans of colluding to keep documents related to Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee, private. Minutes later, Mr. Schumer quietly took his seat near Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader. While the rest of Washington was honoring Mr. McCain, President Trump spent the early hours of the day tweeting his anger about the investigation into his campaign\u2019s ties with Russia during the 2016 election and sending out quotes from a mutual critic of the F.B.I. and Justice Department. \u201cYou have a Fake Dossier, gathered by Steele, paid by the Clinton team to get information on Trump,\u201d he wrote, citing Tom Fitton of Judicial Watch (and misspelling the first name of his predecessor as president). \u201cThe Dossier is Fake, nothing in it has been verified. It then filters into our American court system in order to spy on Barrack Obama and Hillary Clinton\u2019s political opponent.\u201d He also tweeted out his well-known disdain for the news media, which Mr. McCain used to jokingly call \u201cmy base.\u201d Mr. Trump cited Alan Dershowitz, the emeritus Harvard Law School professor, saying that \u201cnews reporting has become part of the adversary system.\u201d Mr. Trump added: \u201cIt has become tainted and corrupt!\u201d While President Trump was not invited to the service, his daughter, Ivanka Trump, and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, arrived, the most prominent figures from the current administration to attend. John Bolton, the president\u2019s national security adviser, also made his way in. Most of the rest of the crowd filling the Washington National Cathedral were committed opponents of the current president, not just Democrats. Former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton were expected to attend. Former Secretary of State John Kerry, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Gov. John Kasich of Ohio mingled among the dignitaries. Two minutes before 9 a.m., Ms. McCain began walking down the path to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, flanked by John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff, and Jim Mattis, the secretary of defense. As she slowly walked, the crowd of onlookers held American flags and cellphones aloft, watching the procession of the McCain children following her. In front of the memorial, Ms. McCain paused and stood by a patriotic wreath that was moved toward her. A minute later, she turned to make her way back to the funeral procession, striding past unfurled American flags and veterans wiping away tears. As she and her children returned to the black cars waiting to head to the Washington National Cathedral, the crowd broke into a minute of applause: a steady stream of clapping that broke the morning silence. In Ms. McCain\u2019s presence, several onlookers saw recognition of more than just Mr. McCain\u2019s legacy, but of their own: the high school classmates they mourned from a despised war, the family members currently in service and veterans they have loved and lost. \u201cHe embodied what all these men fought for,\u201d said Cyndy Hollender-Stancliff, a volunteer at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. After Ms. McCain left, the crowd made its own procession: walking the length of the memorial to stop in front of the wreath of red, white and blue flowers with a Navy ribbon that read \u201cIn Honor of All Who Served\u201d in gold curlicue font. They left their own tokens \u2014 American flags in the stone, posters \u2014 before quietly leaving, their fingers brushing against the names of others who served. One woman, standing off to the side with a small American flag, smiled slightly when asked why she came to the memorial. \u201cJust a good man,\u201d she said, wiping away a tear. Joseph R. Biden Jr., Mitt Romney, Madeleine Albright, David Petraeus and Jay Leno were among the guests trickling into the Washington National Cathedral as the church bells chimed. Lines of naval officers in their crisp dress whites walked to and from the cathedral, all in front of a sprawling media encampment preparing for the day\u2019s events. Mr. Biden, who delivered an emotional eulogy at Mr. McCain\u2019s funeral service in Arizona, pulled out a handkerchief and dabbed his eyes as he entered the cathedral. Among the uninvited: members of the Westboro Baptist Church, who gathered a few blocks away from the cathedral. \u201cMOST PEOPLE GO TO HELL\u201d was among the few printable signs. Dozens of people gathered around the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, forming a quiet ring on the outskirts of the wall before Ms. McCain arrived to honor her husband and other veterans of the Vietnam War. It was almost silent, except for the clipping of Park Police horse hooves on gravel, the rustling of the leaves and the faint strains of the national anthem played in the distance. The people who gathered \u2014 veterans, parents in uniform with their children, runners who paused midstride \u2014 were there not just to pay respects to Mr. McCain. They were there for Ms. McCain and their own loved ones who had served. \u201cMakes us feel special at a very hard time for all of us,\u201d said Bruce Whiteaker, 69, who served in the Air Force during the Vietnam War. \u201cWe\u2019re grateful that she\u2019s decided to stop and honor the fallen in this way.\u201d Mr. Whiteaker made the 10-hour drive from Knoxville, Tenn., with his wife, Shirley, who also served in the Air Force. They brought handmade signs, decorated with American flag stickers, and condolences for the McCain family. \u201cWith Cindy McCain coming today,\u201d Ms. Whiteaker said, tears beginning to run down her face, \u201cwe wanted her to know what we felt for her and her family.\u201d A stubborn grayness rested over Washington, the vast sheet of dark clouds threatening rain as clusters of mourners walked into the cathedral, dressed in black. An American flag hung at half-staff on the front lawn. Police cars and television vans lined the block, the hum of a dozen running engines clashing with the cathedral\u2019s bells. People began lining the streets around the cathedral long before Mr. McCain arrived, pushing baby strollers and holding cups of coffee. Two blocks away, a family stood in their driveway, packing up their car for a camping trip. \u201cOn Saturday mornings, we usually go get doughnuts,\u201d said Louie Renjel, 9, who stood with his father, Louis, at the base of the cathedral\u2019s driveway in a T-shirt and flip-flops, waiting to see Mr. McCain\u2019s coffin arrive. Louie detailed the data points he had learned from his father, a former Senate staff member, about Mr. McCain\u2019s five and a half years as a prisoner of war. Mr. Renjel in recent days found himself watching Mr. McCain\u2019s concession speech for the 2008 presidential election on YouTube. \u201cAfter that loss, to see McCain feeling that kind of personal pain and to put the country ahead of him,\u201d Mr. Renjel said. \u201cI want to teach my son that \u2014 what it means to be great.\u201d",

      "author": "Nick Corasaniti",
      "content": " Donald J. Trump on Tuesday refused to endorse two leading Republicans \u2014 the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, and Senator John McCain of Arizona \u2014 in their primary election campaigns. Mr. Ryan and Mr. McCain have both endorsed Mr. Trump for president, but they have criticized his denouncement of Khizr and Ghazala Khan, the parents of Capt. Humayun Khan, who was killed in Iraq in 2004. \u201cI like Paul, but these are horrible times for our country,\u201d Mr. Trump told The Washington Post. \u201cWe need very strong leadership. We need very, very strong leadership. And I\u2019m just not quite there yet. I\u2019m not quite there yet.\u201d Mr. Trump had signaled support for Mr. Ryan\u2019s little-known primary opponent, Paul Nehlen,  in a Twitter message on Monday night, thanking him for his \u201ckind words.\u201d The nominee\u2019s \u201cnot quite there yet\u201d wording echoed language that Mr. Ryan used in May when he was still wavering on whether to get behind Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump also singled out Mr. McCain, telling The Post: \u201cI\u2019ve never been there with John McCain because I\u2019ve always felt that he should have done a much better job for the vets.\u201d The comments are a significant break in the steps toward party unity that Republican officials have been stressing since their convention last month. The remarks are also an indication that the party is still struggling to heal some of the wounds from Mr. Trump\u2019s primary campaign. After Khizr Khan rebuked Mr. Trump at the Democratic National Convention, Mr. Trump traded in religious stereotypes by suggesting that Mr. Khan might have prevented his wife from speaking at the event. Mr. Ryan said in a statement on Sunday that he rejected Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed Muslim immigration ban as \u201cnot reflective of America\u2019s fundamental values.\u201d He added: \u201cMany Muslim Americans have served valiantly in our military and made the ultimate sacrifice. Captain Khan was one such brave example. His sacrifice \u2014 and that of Khizr and Ghazala Khan \u2014 should always be honored. Period.\u201d Mr. McCain followed with a lengthy statement on Monday, saying: \u201cI cannot emphasize enough how deeply I disagree with Mr. Trump\u2019s statement. I hope Americans understand that the remarks do not represent the views of our Republican Party, its officers or candidates.\u201d",

      "author": "Matt Stevens",
      "content": " The news that Senator John McCain has brain cancer appears \u2014 at least momentarily \u2014 to have unified sharply divided Republican and Democratic politicians in support of a man some praised on Wednesday night as an \u201cAmerican hero.\u201d Almost immediately after the news was announced, Mr. McCain\u2019s colleagues, past and present, took to social media to wish him well. The praise poured in from politicians on both sides of the aisle who have served under various administrations over Mr. McCain\u2019s decades-long career. Well wishes came from senators who have been at odds for weeks amid a debate about heath care, former presidents and even one of Mr. McCain\u2019s congressional colleagues who is himself recovering from surgery. Representative Steve Scalise, who was critically injured last month during a mass shooting at a congressional baseball practice, tweeted his support for Mr. McCain. A former Navy pilot, Mr. McCain, 80, was captured and held as a prisoner during the Vietnam War, and Mr. Scalise was one of several politicians who noted his resolve. \u201cPraying for my friend @SenJohnMcCain, one of the toughest people I know,\u201d he said. In a statement, former President George H. W. Bush said: \u201cThe Hanoi Hilton couldn\u2019t break John McCain\u2019s spirit many years ago, so Barbara and I know \u2014 with confidence \u2014 he and his family will meet this latest battle in his singular life of service with courage and determination.\u201d President Trump called Mr. McCain a \u201cfighter,\u201d sent thoughts and prayers, and told the senator to \u201cget well soon.\u201d Vice President Mike Pence said on Twitter that \u201ccancer picked on the wrong guy\u201d and that Mr. McCain would \u201cwin this fight.\u201d In a similar vein, former President Barack Obama said, \u201cCancer doesn\u2019t know what it\u2019s up against.\u201d He urged Mr. McCain to \u201cGive it hell.\u201d Rep. Joseph Kennedy III, a Massachusetts Democrat whose great-uncle, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, died in 2009 from an aggressive brain tumor, said on Twitter that he was praying for Mr. McCain and his family. \u201cYou won\u2019t meet any stronger and braver than him,\u201d Mr. Kennedy said of Mr. McCain. Support for Mr. McCain extended far beyond Washington. Rosie O\u2019Donnell tweeted a picture of herself and a grinning Mr. McCain. Nancy Sinatra, the singer and eldest daughter of Frank Sinatra, wished Mr. McCain \u201cstrength, courage, prayers and the best of luck\u201d in his fight. And Derrick Hall, the president and chief executive officer of the Arizona Diamondbacks baseball team, which Mr. McCain has said he stays up late to watch, sent prayers to his \u201cgood friend,\u201d who he said would \u201cwin another battle.\u201d Mr. McCain\u2019s daughter Meghan McCain, who is a host on Fox News, also released a statement on Twitter. She said that she and her family were shocked by the news and that they \u201clive with the anxiety about what comes next.\u201d But, she added: \u201cIt won\u2019t surprise you to learn that in all this, the one of us who is most confident and calm is my father. He is the toughest person I know. \u201cSo he is meeting this challenge as he has every other,\u201d she continued. \u201cCancer may afflict him in many ways: but it will not make him surrender. Nothing ever has.\u201d",

      "author": "Michael Tackett",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Tucked between St. Patrick\u2019s Day greetings and repeat criticism of a rerun of \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d President Trump demonstrated that not even death provides a respite from his wrath on Twitter. In posts on Saturday and Sunday, Mr. Trump renewed his criticism of Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican who died in August from complications from a virulent form of brain cancer. The president attacked Mr. McCain over his role in the Justice Department investigation into Russian efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election. He then added that Mr. McCain \u201chad far worse \u2018stains\u2019 \u201d on his record, including the senator\u2019s decisive vote against repealing the Affordable Care Act. \u201cSpreading the fake and totally discredited Dossier \u2018is unfortunately a very dark stain against John McCain,\u2019\u201d he tweeted on Saturday, quoting comments in a Fox News interview by the former independent counsel Ken Starr about the so-called Steele Dossier, which outlined a range of often salacious but unproven misdeeds by Mr. Trump and his associates. \u201cSo it was indeed (just proven in court papers) \u2018last in his class\u2019 (Annapolis) John McCain that sent the Fake Dossier to the FBI and Media hoping to have it printed BEFORE the Election,\u201d he wrote on Sunday. \u201cHe & the Dems, working together, failed (as usual). Even the Fake News refused this garbage!\u201d In fact, Mr. McCain provided a copy of the dossier to the F.B.I. after Election Day. But supporters of Mr. Trump have seized on the dossier\u2019s uncorroborated accusations and political roots in the campaign as a way to try to discredit the special counsel\u2019s Russia inquiry. The comments exemplified Mr. Trump\u2019s model for presidential communication, both in form and tone, exploiting the power and urgency of social media, often with harsh and bitterly personal attacks. But they also sparked swift condemnation, showing that the president abandons conventional boundaries of civility like not speaking ill of the dead at his peril. \u201cThere\u2019s no low with him,\u201d John Weaver, who was a political adviser to Mr. McCain, said in an interview. \u201cThere\u2019s no bottom.\u201d Mr. Trump and Mr. McCain had a long history of enmity, one that lasted even through the senator\u2019s death. Mr. McCain made it clear that Mr. Trump was not welcome at his memorial service in Washington, even as both President Barack Obama, who defeated Mr. McCain in the 2008 presidential race, and President George W. Bush, who defeated him in the Republican primaries in 2000, delivered eulogies. And over the weekend, the tensions resurfaced, as McCain supporters denounced the president\u2019s tweets \u2014 and, in many cases, the president himself. Mr. Weaver criticized Mr. Trump\u2019s avoidance of service in Vietnam, where Mr. McCain was held captive as a prisoner of war, his refusal to release his own grades while criticizing Mr. McCain\u2019s academic performance at the United States Naval Academy, and the president\u2019s desire to terminate the Affordable Care Act. \u201cThese are the things he wanted to attack John McCain on? Seriously?\u201d Mr. Weaver said. \u201cI am waiting for Republican members of the Senate who served with the senator for years and allowed him to be the point of the spear on so many issues,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere are they?\u201d Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and one of Mr. McCain\u2019s closest friends, chose to praise his friend rather than criticize the president. \u201cAs to @SenJohnMcCain and his devotion to his country: He stepped forward to risk his life for his country, served honorably under difficult circumstances, and was one of the most consequential senators in the history of the body,\u201d he said on Twitter. \u201cNothing about his service will ever be changed or diminished.\u201d Mike Murphy, another McCain political adviser, displayed no such reluctance to chastise the president: \u201cMcCain was a hero,\u201d he said. \u201cTrump is a whimpering coward. He was afraid to go to Vietnam 47 years ago and is afraid to face the legal consequences of his actions today.\u201d \u201cHe just has no empathy,\u201d Mr. Murphy said. \u201cHe\u2019s only concerned with himself.\u201d Mark Salter, one of Mr. McCain\u2019s closest advisers and co-author of several books with him, was even more biting. \u201cHere is what will never change,\u201d Mr. Salter said in a tweet. \u201cJohn McCain will always be a better man than you in every way we measure a man\u2019s character. You\u2019ll never beat him.\u201d The White House did not respond to a request for comment about Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks. Still, Mr. Trump insisted on using Mr. McCain as a posthumous whipping post, even taking a dig at Mr. McCain\u2019s academic record, calling him \u201clast in his class.\u201d Mr. McCain often mocked his own performance in the classroom as a midshipman, and never shied from noting that he graduated fifth from the bottom. The president had no public events on his schedule this weekend, but he kept up a barrage of tweets. He called for fealty to the Fox News personalities Jeanine Pirro, who was suspended by the network after questioning a Muslim lawmaker\u2019s loyalty to the United States, and Tucker Carlson, who has come under criticism for his remarks on a shock-jock radio program about a decade ago. Mr. Trump also again threatened to use the federal government to crack down on programs that make fun of him, singling out \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d He did participate in one unscheduled event, taking a short car ride across Pennsylvania Avenue on Sunday to attend services at St. John\u2019s Episcopal Church, a rarity for Mr. Trump. The second reading, according to the program, was from Philippians, which begins \u201cjoin together in following my example, brothers and sisters, and just as you have us as a model, keep your eyes on those who live as we do.\u201d",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Senator John McCain, who died on Saturday at age 81, will lie in state in the Capitol Rotunda and receive a full dress funeral service at the Washington National Cathedral. Mr. McCain, who served for two decades in the Navy after graduating from the Naval Academy and who represented Arizona in Congress for 35 years, will also lie in state at the Arizona Capitol before his burial in Annapolis, Md., a Republican official involved in the planning said. The senator\u2019s office said an official memorial schedule would be announced once funeral arrangements were finalized. [Read the obituary for John McCain, who endured five years of captivity in Vietnam and rose to the heights of power in Washington.] Two Republicans familiar with the planning said that Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama have been asked to offer eulogies at his funeral. Under initial plans for Mr. McCain\u2019s funeral, Vice President Mike Pence was to attend, but not President Trump, who clashed repeatedly with Mr. McCain. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the top Senate Democrat, said on Saturday that he would introduce a resolution to rename the Russell Senate Office Building \u2014 currently named for Senator Richard Russell of Georgia, who often opposed civil rights legislation \u2014 in honor of Mr. McCain. [Here\u2019s a schedule of tributes to Mr. McCain, and a look at what \u201clying in state\u201d means.] More than 30 people have been honored by lying in state in the Capitol Rotunda, a gesture reserved for the country\u2019s \u201cmost eminent citizens,\u201d since the practice began in 1852 after the death of Henry Clay, the former House speaker and senator from Kentucky. Mr. McCain would be the 13th former senator to be granted the honor, according to the Architect of the Capitol. Such remembrances in the Capitol are either formally approved by congressional resolution or authorized by the congressional leadership, according to the Architect of the Capitol. In Arizona, Gov. Doug Ducey ordered all flags to be lowered to half-staff. Last month, as Mr. McCain neared the end of his monthslong battle with brain cancer, the Navy expanded the name of the guided missile destroyer John S. McCain to formally include the senator, who joined his father and grandfather, both Navy admirals and Annapolis graduates. The annual military spending bill was also named for Mr. McCain, who served as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.",

      "content": "Former President George W. Bush on Saturday delivered a eulogy on behalf of Senator John McCain at a ceremony at the National Cathedral attended by many of Washington\u2019s top current and former lawmakers. The following is a transcript of those remarks, as released by Mr. Bush\u2019s office. [For more coverage of the ceremony, read here.] ___________ FORMER PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH: Cindy and the McCain Family, I am honored to be with you to offer my sympathies and to celebrate a great life. The nation joins your extraordinary family in grief and gratitude for John McCain. Some lives are so vivid, it is difficult to imagine them ended. Some voices are so vibrant and distinctive, it is hard to think of them stilled. A man who seldom rested is laid to rest. And his absence is tangible, like the silence after a mighty roar. The thing about John\u2019s life was the amazing sweep of it. From a tiny prison cell in Vietnam to the floor of the United States Senate. From troublemaking plebe to presidential candidate. Wherever John passed throughout the world, people immediately knew there was a leader in their midst. In one epic life was written the courage and greatness of our country. For John and me, there was a personal journey \u2013 a hard-fought political history. Back in the day, he could frustrate me. (Laughter.) And I know he\u2019d say the same thing about me. But he also made me better. In recent years, we sometimes talked of that intense period like football players remembering a big game. In the process, rivalry melted away. In the end, I got to enjoy one of life\u2019s great gifts: the friendship of John McCain. And I will miss him. Moments before my last debate \u2013 ever \u2013 with Senator John Kerry in Phoenix, I was trying to gather some thoughts in the holding room. I felt a presence\u2026 opened my eyes\u2026and six inches from my face was McCain, who yelled, \u201cRELAX! RELAX!\u201d (Laughter.) John was, above all, a man with a code. He lived by a set of public virtues that brought strength and purpose to his life and to his country. He was courageous \u2013 with a courage that frightened his captors and inspired his countrymen. He was honest, no matter whom it offended. Presidents were not spared. (Laughter.) He was honorable \u2013 always recognizing that his opponents were still patriots and human beings. He loved freedom, with the passion of a man who knew its absence. He respected the dignity inherent in every life - a dignity that does not stop at borders and cannot be erased by dictators. Perhaps above all, John detested the abuse of power. He could not abide bigots and swaggering despots. There was something deep inside him that made him stand up for the little guy \u2013 to speak for forgotten people in forgotten places. One friend from his Naval Academy days recalled how John \u2013 while a lowly plebe \u2013 reacted to seeing an upperclassman verbally abuse a steward. Against all tradition, he told the jerk to pick on someone his own size. It was a familiar refrain during his six decades of service. Where did such strength of conviction come from? Perhaps from a family where honor was in the atmosphere. Or from the firsthand experience of cruelty, which left physical reminders that lasted his whole life. Or from some deep well of moral principle. Whatever the cause, it was this combination of courage and decency that defined John\u2019s calling \u2013 and so closely paralleled the calling of his country. It is this combination of courage and decency that makes the American military something new in history \u2013 an unrivaled power for good. It is this combination of courage and decency that set America on a journey into the world \u2013 to liberate death camps, to stand guard against extremism, and to work for the true peace that comes only with freedom. John felt these commitments in his bones. It is a tribute to his moral compass that dissidents and prisoners in so many places \u2013 from Russia, to North Korea, to China \u2013 knew that he was on their side. And I think their respect meant more to him than any medals and honors life could bring. This passion for fairness and justice extended to our own military. When a Private was poorly equipped, or a Seaman was overworked in terrible conditions, John enjoyed nothing more than dressing down an Admiral or a General. He remained that troublesome plebe to the end. (Laughter.) Those in political power were not exempt. At various points throughout his long career, John confronted policies and practices that he believed were unworthy of his country. To the face of those in authority, John McCain would insist: We are better than this. America is better than this. John \u2013 as he was the first to tell you \u2013 was not a perfect man. But he dedicated his life to national ideals that are as perfect as men and women have yet conceived. He was motivated by a vision of America carried ever forward, ever upward, on the strength of its principles. He saw our country not only as a physical place or power, but as the carrier of enduring human aspirations. As an advocate for the oppressed. As a defender of the peace. As a promise, unwavering, undimmed, unequaled. The strength of a democracy is renewed by reaffirming the principles on which it was founded. And America somehow has always found leaders who were up to that task, particularly at times of greatest need. John was born to meet that kind of challenge \u2013 to defend and demonstrate the defining ideals of our nation. If we are ever tempted to forget who we are, to grow weary of our cause, John\u2019s voice will always come as a whisper over our shoulder: We are better than this. America is better than this. John was a restless soul. He really didn\u2019t glory in success or wallow in failure, because he was always on to the next thing. A friend said, \u201cHe can\u2019t stand to stay in the same experience.\u201d One of his books ended with the words: \u201cAnd I moved on.\u201d John has moved on. He would probably not want us to dwell on it. But we are better for his presence among us. The world is smaller for his departure. And we will remember him as he was: unwavering, undimmed, unequaled.",

      "author": "Alison Mitchell",
      "content": " It was just about this time three years ago that John Weaver, a tall, terse Texan, dragged Senator John McCain from a Senate Commerce Committee hearing to tell him he should run for president. Mr. Weaver, a Republican political consultant from San Antonio, had worked with Mr. McCain as field director of Senator Phil Gramm's short-lived presidential campaign in 1996. He had decided that Mr. McCain, with his compelling personal biography and maverick stances, had just the right resume for the post-Clinton years. And perhaps more important, he thought the Republican Party had lost its way and let President Clinton emerge as the one who understood the concerns of middle-class voters. Neither Mr. Weaver nor Mr. McCain knew what they were on their way to creating that day: a seat-of-the pants populist candidacy that has turned the Republican Party establishment on its head and is now threatening its chosen candidate, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. Now Mr. Weaver, 40, the constant brooding presence on the campaign bus -- Mr. McCain impishly calls him Sunny because he is not -- is one of a small band of Republican insiders who are helping Mr. McCain mount a campaign that often seems to run on gut instincts, impulse and wit. Even Mr. McCain acknowledges some surprise at how his populist reform message is growing into something larger than the sum of its parts. His New Hampshire primary upset -- if replicated elsewhere -- suggests that he has an appeal that stretches broadly across the political spectrum. ''It's fair to say we knew what we were trying to do,'' Mr. McCain said. ''But we didn't realize that it was catching on.'' There is still a hard road ahead of Mr. McCain, and many potential pitfalls. The senator's appeal is built on intangibles that include a public infatuation with his personality and his gripping biography. Some of the luster could fade as voters focus more on his policy positions over time. Mr. Bush is already trying to tar him as a hypocrite on campaign finance reform because he has accepted campaign donations from lobbyists. And it may still turn out that Mr. Bush's money and organization kick in and stem the insurgency. Mr. McCain's success so far has been a combination of some early planning, some risks that paid off and some clever off-the-cuff decision making. His gamble to skip Iowa and concentrate on New Hampshire worked out spectacularly, as did his certainty that he could generate a bonanza of media coverage through his accessibility. Mr. McCain has also benefited from the strangely ineffective campaign that the front-runner has conducted. Mr. Bush has seemed diffident, and he has kept piling on endorsements even after signs that they were backfiring. For now the McCain candidacy has hit a nerve. ''McCain set out to create an insurgency,'' said William Kristol, the former chief of staff to Vice President Dan Quayle and editor of The Weekly Standard, ''but as often happens in these situations, it's almost bigger than him and bigger than any of the proposals. And it goes beyond his personal ambitions or intentions.'' Mr. McCain said the first one in his circle to notice what was happening was Mark Salter, his speechwriter and longtime Senate administrative assistant, who saw the excitement grow in Mr. McCain's New Hampshire crowds. ''He said to me three or four times, 'Look at the look in these people's eyes,' '' Mr. McCain said. Some of Mr. McCain's themes were meticulously planned from the beginning -- the emphasis on character, national security expertise, campaign finance overhaul and the devotion of much of the surplus to Social Security. But some of the populist tones of the campaign arose from snap decisions made along the way, like Mr. McCain's antic appearance before the Russian consulate accusing New York Republicans of acting like apparatchiks seeking to preserve a one-party state. The stunt was dreamed up the day before by Mike Murphy, Mr. McCain's bomb-throwing senior strategist, as a way of fighting the party's effort to keep Mr. McCain off the ballot for the state's primary. The candidate loved it. And no one quite expected Mr. McCain's campaign bus, ''Straight Talk Express,'' to become a symbol in itself of his live-off-the-land campaign. ''The bus just kind of evolved,'' Mr. Weaver said. ''I'm a big believer in bus tours. John wanted to have the press with him, and one thing led to another and it became a tradition that, unfortunately, I don't think we could ever stop.'' Greg Stevens, Mr. McCain's media consultant, said simply, ''We were trying to win. We are creating a new party in the process of trying to win.'' He said, ''There wasn't this overt decision on the part of the campaign six months ago to try to create McCain Republicans.'' What is threatening to the Republican Party is that Mr. McCain in many ways is running against its Congressional leadership, against its big-business wing and against some of its conservative allies, groups like Americans for Tax Reform and the National Right to Life Committee, which have both run advertisements against him. He tars all of them as the Washington establishment that has lost touch with the people. There is an unlikely group of battle-scared campaign veterans from across the spectrum of the Republican Party who are helping Mr. McCain do this. And they are hardly outsiders. Rick Davis, 42, the campaign manager, is a Washington lobbyist and merchant banker known as a fund-raising whiz who has close ties to the same business establishment that Mr. McCain likes to rail against. Mr. Murphy, 37, is known for some of the most rough-edged commercials in the business and has worked for clients as diverse as Christine Todd Whitman and Oliver North. He did not join the McCain campaign formally until Lamar Alexander had dropped out of the race because he had been with Mr. Alexander in 1996 and remained loyal. Mr. Stevens, 51, the media consultant, began his political career as chief of staff to former Gov. Thomas H. Kean of New Jersey, and he worked for the presidential campaign of Bob Dole. Bill McInturff, 46, Mr. McCain's pollster, was Mr. Dole's pollster. Mr. Salter, 44, is the McCain loyalist who helped write Mr. McCain's autobiography. Mr. Weaver was once the executive director of the Texas Republican Party and has counted 11 senators as his political clients. ''All of us came together for different reasons,'' Mr. Weaver said, ''but we're unified in thinking the party has to change its way. We've lost two national elections and are in danger of losing Congress.'' Mr. McCain, 63, had been intrigued by the idea of running for president ever since he accompanied his friend Bob Dole on the campaign trail in 1996, acting as what he calls Mr. Dole's designated smiler. He says his role was to sit in front of Mr. Dole in audiences and grin as a way of trying to remind the candidate not to look so dour. He made his decision to run in December 1998. From the start his campaign emphasized his character and extraordinary experience as a prisoner of war in Vietnam to distinguish him from Mr. Clinton. This laid the groundwork for what could have been a fairly traditional Republican campaign, appealing to conservative voters through the emphasis on a strong military and military traditions of honor and patriotism. Mr. Dole, who had been grievously wounded in World War II, had himself sometimes emphasized his biography and had certainly tried to run against Mr. Clinton's character. But Mr. McCain also had in his quiver of issues his Senate crusade to overhaul the campaign finance law. His aides were concerned that this would not resonate with the voters and they hoped to persuade him to play it down. But when they tested it in the polling they used to start the campaign they were surprised to find that in four critical primary states, 60 percent of Republican voters said a change in the finance system was important. Only 15 percent said it was not. ''We knew that John would talk about it,'' Mr. Weaver said. ''We didn't think he should stress it. So we had to eat a lot of crow.'' It was also Mr. McCain himself, his aides say, who decided early on that he wanted to depart from the tax-cutting wing of his party that advocated supply-side economics and put more of an emphasis on using the budget surplus for Social Security and debt reduction. His plans to make this point last spring were disrupted when the United States bombing of Yugoslavia began and Mr. McCain decided he would not formally announce his candidacy during a military campaign. Mr. McCain returned to the Social Security issue this winter, making it a critical point of distinction between him and Mr. Bush. Some of the nature of the McCain campaign was developed because of his comparative lack of money, which forced some unorthodox thinking. Mr. Murphy remembers gathering with Mr. McCain and a few aides in 1998 in his Senate office. He pulled out his laptop computer full of slides and data and argued for 40 minutes that the senator should save money by skipping the Iowa caucuses. Mr. Davis, who had also been courted sporadically by Elizabeth Dole's campaign, then built an organization that was lean by presidential standards, allowing as much money as possible to be put into television advertising. The lack of staff -- Mr. McCain has 65 full-time aides compared with about 180 for Mr. Bush -- has shown at times in the campaign's inability to turn out polished position papers. But it has also made the campaign flexible and able to change gears fast. Earlier this year, for example, after reading in a newspaper that minority journalists felt insulted that Mr. Bush had turned down an invitation to stop by their convention, Mr. McCain decided to toss out his schedule and go to the convention. Some of Mr. McCain's populist, establishment-bashing tones have come in reaction to the Bush campaign and the establishment opposition to him. He would not have been making gleeful attacks on the New York Republican leaders if they had not tried to keep him off the ballot. ''When the establishment pushes, he pushes back,'' Mr. Murphy said. ''Weighing in as they have they've created some of this. There's poetic justice in all of this.'' On Friday, in a vindication of Mr. McCain's effort, a federal judge put the senator's name on the ballot all over the state. At moments, members of Mr. McCain's inner circle have started to fear the populism of their own campaign. On the stump, Mr. McCain began skewering Mr. Bush's tax plan as too tilted to the rich after he read a magazine article that made that analysis. But when the campaign weighed whether to put that line of argument into a commercial, aides say there was quite a debate about whether to go forward with a class warfare tactic usually more the province of Democrats. According to participants in the discussion Vin Weber, a lobbyist who is a member of Mr. McCain's informal kitchen cabinet, opposed the move. Mr. Davis wanted any decision to run the advertisement to be made deliberately and carefully. Mr. Weaver, Mr. Murphy and Mr. Stevens were all for it. The commercial was broadcast. And as Mr. McCain's campaign goes on, its rebel spirit is only growing stronger. Mr. Salter joined Mr. McCain's Senate staff after working for Jeane J. Kirkpatrick, the former United States ambassador to the United Nations. He does not have the profile of a rabble-rouser. But on the night of the New Hampshire primary, when Mr. McCain promised to ''break the Washington iron triangle of big money, lobbyists and legislation,'' Mr. Salter was in the audience shouting, ''Burn it down.''",

No man ever had a more loving wife or children he was prouder of than I am of mine. And I owe it to America. To be connected to America\u2019s causes \u2014 liberty, equal justice, respect for the dignity of all people \u2014 brings happiness more sublime than life\u2019s fleeting pleasures. Our identities and sense of worth are not circumscribed but enlarged by serving good causes bigger than ourselves. \u2018Fellow Americans\u2019 \u2014 that association has meant more to me than any other. I lived and died a proud American. We are citizens of the world\u2019s greatest republic, a nation of ideals, not blood and soil. We are blessed and are a blessing to humanity when we uphold and advance those ideals at home and in the world. We have helped liberate more people from tyranny and poverty than ever before in history. We have acquired great wealth and power in the process. We weaken our greatness when we confuse our patriotism with tribal rivalries that have sown resentment and hatred and violence in all the corners of the globe. We weaken it when we hide behind walls, rather than tear them down, when we doubt the power of our ideals, rather than trust them to be the great force for change they have always been. We are three-hundred-and-twenty-five million opinionated, vociferous individuals. We argue and compete and sometimes even vilify each other in our raucous public debates. But we have always had so much more in common with each other than in disagreement. If only we remember that and give each other the benefit of the presumption that we all love our country we will get through these challenging times. We will come through them stronger than before. We always do. Ten years ago, I had the privilege to concede defeat in the election for president. I want to end my farewell to you with the heartfelt faith in Americans that I felt so powerfully that evening. I feel it powerfully still. Do not despair of our present difficulties but believe always in the promise and greatness of America, because nothing is inevitable here. Americans never quit. We never surrender. We never hide from history. We make history. Farewell, fellow Americans. God bless you, and God bless America.\u201d",

      "author": "",
      "content": "Former President Barack Obama on Saturday delivered a eulogy on behalf of Senator John McCain at a ceremony at the National Cathedral attended by many of Washington\u2019s top current and former lawmakers. The following is a transcript of those remarks, as prepared by The New York Times. [For more coverage of the ceremony, read here.] ___________ FORMER PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: To John\u2019s beloved family \u2014 Mrs. McCain; to Cindy and the McCain children, President and Mrs. Bush, President and Secretary Clinton; Vice President and Mrs. Biden; Vice President and Mrs. Cheney, Vice President Gore, and, as John would say, my friends: We come to celebrate an extraordinary man \u2013 a warrior, a statesman, a patriot who embodied so much that is best in America. President Bush and I are among the fortunate few who competed against John at the highest levels of politics. He made us better presidents. Just as he made the Senate better. Just as he made this country better. So for someone like John to ask you, while he\u2019s still alive, to stand and speak of him when he\u2019s gone, is a precious and singular honor. Now, when John called me with that request earlier this year, I\u2019ll admit sadness and also a certain surprise. But after our conversation ended, I realized how well it captured some of John\u2019s essential qualities. To start with, John liked being unpredictable, even a little contrarian. He had no interest in conforming to some prepackaged version of what a senator should be, and he didn\u2019t want a memorial that was going to be prepackaged either. It also showed John\u2019s disdain for self-pity. He had been to hell and back, and he had somehow never lost his energy, or his optimism, or his zest for life. So cancer did not scare him, and he would maintain that buoyant spirit to very end, too stubborn to sit still, opinionated as ever, fiercely devoted to his friends and most of all, to his family. It showed his irreverence \u2013 his sense of humor, little bit of a mischievous streak. After all, what better way to get a last laugh than to make George and I say nice things about him to a national audience? And most of all, it showed a largeness of spirit, an ability to see past differences in search of common ground. And in fact, on the surface, John and I could not have been more different. We\u2019re of different generations. I came from a broken home and never knew my father; John was the scion of one of America\u2019s most distinguished military families. I have a reputation for keeping cool; John \u2014 not so much. We were standard bearers of different American political traditions, and throughout my presidency, John never hesitated to tell me when he thought I was screwing up \u2013 which, by his calculation, was about once a day. But for all our differences, for all the times we sparred, I never tried to hide, and I think John came to understand, the longstanding admiration that I had for him. By his own account, John was a rebellious young man. In his case, that\u2019s understandable \u2013 what faster way to distinguish yourself when you\u2019re the son and grandson of admirals than to mutiny? Eventually, though, he concluded that the only way to really make his mark on the world is to commit to something bigger than yourself. And for John, that meant answering the highest of callings \u2013 serving his country in a time of war. Others this week and this morning have spoken to the depths of his torment, and the depths of his courage, there in the cells of Hanoi, when day after day, year after year, that youthful iron was tempered into steel. It brings to mind something that Hemingway wrote in the book that Meghan referred to, his favorite book: \u201cToday is only one day in all the days that will ever be. But what will happen in all the other days that ever come can depend on what you do today.\u201d In captivity, John learned, in ways that few of us ever will, the meaning of those words \u2013 how each moment, each day, each choice is a test. And John McCain passed that test \u2013 again and again and again. And that\u2019s why, when John spoke of virtues like service, and duty, it didn\u2019t ring hollow. They weren\u2019t just words to him. It was a truth that he had lived, and for which he was prepared to die. It forced even the most cynical to consider what were we doing for our country, what might we risk everything for. Much has been said this week about what a maverick John was. Now, in fact, John was a pretty conservative guy. Trust me, I was on the receiving end of some of those votes. But he did understand that some principles transcend politics. That some values transcend party. He considered it part of his duty to uphold those principles and uphold those values. John cared about the institutions of self-government \u2013 our Constitution, our Bill of Rights, rule of law and separation of powers, even the arcane rules and procedures of the Senate. He knew that, in a nation as big and boisterous and diverse as ours, those institutions, those rules, those norms are what bind us together and give shape and order to our common life, even when we disagree, especially when we disagree. John believed in honest argument and hearing other views. He understood that if we get in the habit of bending the truth to suit political expediency or party orthodoxy, our democracy will not work. That\u2019s why he was willing to buck his own party at times, occasionally work across the aisle on campaign finance reform and immigration reform. That\u2019s why he championed a free and independent press as vital to our democratic debate. And the fact that it earned him some good coverage didn\u2019t hurt, either. John understood, as JFK understood, as Ronald Reagan understood, that part of what makes our country great is that our membership is based not on our bloodline; not on what we look like, what our last names are. It\u2019s not based on where our parents or grandparents came from, or how recently they arrived, but on adherence to a common creed: That all of us are created equal. Endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights. It\u2019s been mentioned today, and we\u2019ve seen footage this week of John pushing back against supporters who challenged my patriotism during the 2008 campaign. I was grateful, but I wasn\u2019t surprised. As Joe Lieberman said, it was John\u2019s instinct. I never saw John treat anyone differently because of their race, or religion, or gender. And I\u2019m certain that in those moments that have been referred to during the campaign, he saw himself as defending America\u2019s character, not just mine, for he considered it the imperative of every citizen who loves this country to treat all people fairly. And finally, while John and I disagreed on all kinds of foreign policy issues, we stood together on America\u2019s role as the one indispensable nation, believing that with great power and great blessings comes great responsibility. That burden is borne most heavily by our men and women in uniform \u2013 service members like Doug, Jimmy, and Jack, who followed in their father\u2019s footsteps \u2013 as well as the families who serve alongside our troops. But John understood that our security and our influence was won not just by our military might, not just by our wealth, not just by our ability to bend others to our will, but from our capacity to inspire others, with our adherence to a set of universal values \u2013 like rule of law and human rights, and an insistence on the God-given dignity of every human being. Of course, John was the first to tell us that he was not perfect. Like all of us who go into public service, he did have an ego. Like all of us, there were no doubt some votes he cast, some compromises he struck, some decisions he made that he wished he could have back. It\u2019s no secret, it\u2019s been mentioned that he had a temper, and when it flared up, it was a force of nature, a wonder to behold \u2013 his jaw grinding, his face reddening, his eyes boring a hole right through you. Not that I ever experienced it firsthand, mind you. But to know John was to know that as quick as his passions might flare, he was just as quick to forgive and ask for forgiveness. He knew more than most his own flaws and his blind spots, and he knew how to laugh at himself. And that self-awareness made him all the more compelling. We didn\u2019t advertise it, but every so often over the course of my presidency, John would come over to the White House, and we\u2019d just sit and talk in the Oval Office, just the two of us \u2013 we\u2019d talk about policy and we\u2019d talk about family and we\u2019d talk about the state of our politics. And our disagreements didn\u2019t go away during these private conversations. Those were real, and they were often deep. But we enjoyed the time we shared away from the bright lights. And we laughed with each other, and we learned from each other. We never doubted the other man\u2019s sincerity or the other man\u2019s patriotism, or that when all was said and done, we were on the same team. We never doubted we were on the same team. For all of our differences, we shared a fidelity to the ideals for which generations of Americans have marched, and fought, and sacrificed, and given their lives. We considered our political battles a privilege, an opportunity to serve as stewards of those ideals here at home, and to do our best to advance them around the world. We saw this country as a place where anything is possible \u2013 and citizenship as an obligation to ensure it forever remains that way. More than once during his career, John drew comparisons to Teddy Roosevelt. And I\u2019m sure it\u2019s been noted that Roosevelt\u2019s \u201cMan in the Arena\u201d oration seems tailored to John. Most of you know it: Roosevelt speaks of those who strive, who dare to do great things, who sometimes win and sometimes come up short, but always relish a good fight \u2013 a contrast to those cold, timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat. Isn\u2019t that the spirit we celebrate this week? That striving to be better, to do better, to be worthy of the great inheritance that our founders bestowed. So much of our politics, our public life, our public discourse, can seem small and mean and petty, trafficking in bombast and insult, in phony controversies and manufactured outrage. It\u2019s a politics that pretends to be brave and tough, but in fact is born of fear. John called on us to be bigger than that. He called on us to be better than that. \u201cToday is only one day in all the days that will ever be. But what will happen in all the other days that will ever come can depend on what you do today.\u201d What better way to honor John McCain\u2019s life of service than, as best we can, follow his example? To prove that the willingness to get in the arena and fight for this country is not reserved for the few, it is open to all of us, that in fact it\u2019s demanded of all of us, as citizens of this great republic? That\u2019s perhaps how we honor him best \u2013 by recognizing that there are some things bigger than party, or ambition, or money, or fame or power. That there are some things that are worth risking everything for. Principles that are eternal. Truths that are abiding. At his best, John showed us what that means. For that, we are all deeply in his debt. May God bless John McCain, and may God bless this country he served so well.",

      "content": " Politicians from both sides of the aisle and leaders from around the world remembered John McCain, the war hero turned leading Republican politician, after he died on Saturday in his Arizona home. Mr. McCain, who had a malignant brain tumor that was discovered in 2017, was praised for his patriotism and defiance of party leaders. President Trump, with whom Mr. McCain had a yearslong, bitter feud, offered his \u201cdeepest sympathies and respect\u201d to Mr. McCain\u2019s family in a tweet on Saturday night. Many praised Mr. McCain\u2019s congressional career, which began after he was a prisoner of war in Vietnam, where he was tortured. He was elected to the House of Representatives in 1982, and the Senate in 1986, becoming known for his stances on campaign finance reform, immigration and foreign policy. Cindy McCain, Mr. McCain\u2019s wife, tweeted that her \u201cheart is broken.\u201d \u201cI am so lucky to have lived the adventure of loving this incredible man for 38 years,\u201d she said, adding that he died \u201con his own terms.\u201d Vice President Mike Pence said in a tweet, \u201cGod bless John McCain.\u201d \u201cWe honor his lifetime of service to this nation in our military and in public life,\u201d he continued. President Barack Obama, who defeated Mr. McCain in the 2008 presidential election, said in a statement: \u201cFew of us have been tested the way John once was, or required to show the kind of courage that he did. But all of us can aspire to the courage to put the greater good above our own. At John\u2019s best, he showed us what that means.\u201d President George W. Bush said in a statement that Mr. McCain was a \u201cman of deep conviction and a patriot of the highest order.\u201d \u201cSome lives are so vivid, it is difficult to imagine them ended,\u201d Mr. Bush said. \u201cSome voices are so vibrant, it is hard to think of them stilled.\u201d President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, the former first lady and 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, said in a statement that Mr. McCain \u201cfrequently put partisanship aside to do what he thought was best for the country, and was never afraid to break the mold if it was the right thing to do.\u201d Last year, Mr. McCain made a dramatic appearance in the Senate, with a scar on his forehead from brain surgery, to cast a thumbs-down vote against his own party\u2019s drive to repeal the Affordable Care Act. \u201cSenator John McCain believed that every citizen has a responsibility to make something of the freedoms given by our Constitution, and from his heroic service in the Navy to his 35 years in Congress, he lived by his creed every day,\u201d the Clintons said. \u201cHe was a skilled, tough politician, as well as a trusted colleague alongside whom Hillary was honored to serve in the Senate.\u201d The prime minister of Britain, Theresa May, said it was an honor to call Mr. McCain a friend of the United Kingdom. \u201cJohn McCain was a great statesman, who embodied the idea of service over self,\u201d she said in a tweet. Scott Morrison, the Australian prime minister, said that Mr. McCain visited the country\u2019s Parliament in 2017 and that he knew he was \u201cin the presence of a truly great man.\u201d \u201cHe embodied everything that we respect and value and love about our American friends,\u201d he told reporters.",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 John McCain was an essential element of the nation\u2019s political conversation for half a century, an ever-present figure eager to challenge friend and foe through his singular temperament \u2014 sometimes angry, often funny, always ardent. Now he is gone, leaving behind a storied life and a tear in America\u2019s political fabric at a time when national unity \u2014 always a McCain theme and ultimate goal \u2014 seems especially elusive. \u201cWe are losing someone who really, no matter who was the president, believed in the Senate\u2019s role in checks and balances,\u201d said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, who was a frequent traveling companion of Mr. McCain on official overseas trips. \u201cHe truly was a giant in the Senate, a towering figure and someone who really made a difference not just on policy, but in asserting the Senate\u2019s constitutional role.\u201d The capital has had some time to adjust to life without Mr. McCain given his absence since December for treatment of the brain cancer that finally took his life on Saturday. He weighed in from afar on a range of issues in the meantime, but the digital messages from Arizona lacked the power they might have had if delivered in his always self-certain style on the Senate floor. His death will be deeply felt. [Read the obituary for John McCain, who endured five years of captivity in Vietnam and rose to the heights of power in Washington] It seemed particularly fitting that Mr. McCain died nine years to the day after the same virulent form of brain cancer claimed the life of Senator Edward M. Kennedy, his longtime friend, occasional foil and legislative partner on big issues such as immigration. Both enjoyed a boisterous scrap on the Senate floor and could laugh about it afterward. Both were the type of larger-than-life characters who could command the attention of the Senate \u2014 and the nation \u2014 on the issues of the day. The struggling Senate is a smaller place without them. Mr. McCain had real power, not just the kind that comes from seniority and being a committee chairman, but the kind that comes from rich \u2014 and sometimes shattering \u2014 life experiences that provide credibility and heft to positions. No one else could talk about the need to ban torture with the authority of Mr. McCain, who had been tortured during his more than five years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam. And his crusade for better campaign finance laws arose from his own bitter experience as a member of the Keating Five, the group of senators exposed for interceding with bank regulators on behalf of a generous donor. He was also an institutionalist, helping lead the bipartisan Gang of 14 that in 2005 struck a deal to preserve the filibuster against judicial nominees. It was a temporary reprieve, as it would turn out, but it showcased Mr. McCain as a creature of the Senate willing to put what he saw as the fate of the chamber above more partisan interests. Mr. McCain was of the era when senators saw themselves \u2014 and their branch of the government \u2014 as independent equals of the executive, not merely an extension of it. John McCain was tremendously resilient. He endured grueling rehabilitation from his P.O.W. experience to return to the military and become naval liaison to the Senate, whetting an interest in politics that eventually took him to the House and then the Senate. As a first-term senator in 1987, he met with federal regulators on behalf of a donor and savings-and-loan chairman. The ensuing Keating Five scandal, which stretched from 1989 to 1991, was a public humiliation for Mr. McCain, a real blow to someone who lived by a stringent honor code. The only Republican implicated, he also received the most lenient finding by the ethics committee, which found him guilty of poor judgment. The televised hearings essentially ended the political careers of several of the other senators involved. But that searing experience drove Mr. McCain to become a more independent lawmaker as well as a champion of campaign finance changes intended to reduce the influence of big money in politics, and he eventually became his party\u2019s presidential nominee in 2008, after a failed bid in 2000. The loss to Barack Obama that followed rocked Mr. McCain, and he returned to the Senate unhappy and somewhat at a loss. But he eventually recovered his footing and remained an outspoken force on immigration and the military \u2014 and an outspoken opponent of the Obama administration on a variety of domestic and foreign affairs issues. Few in the Senate escaped Mr. McCain\u2019s outbursts of temper, and he could be extremely cutting and dismissive to those he saw as standing in his way or offering what he considered unfounded views. During his presidential run in 2008, some of his colleagues whispered concerns that his temper was potentially disqualifying. But the episodes often quickly passed, and Mr. McCain would offer apologies. For a man who built his public reputation through close ties to journalists, he could also be up and down with the news media. But even when angry, he had a hard time keeping himself away and thoroughly enjoyed jousting with the reporters who frequented the Capitol hallways. When he first returned to Washington in July 2017 after his devastating diagnosis, reporters were encouraged to stay far away from him to avoid passing on any illness, given his weakened immune system. That lasted about a day, and soon Mr. McCain was striding through the Senate hallways as usual, trading barbs and bits of information with journalists and colleagues who were aware that their moments with him were drawing to a close. The final elections of his career marked a turn to the right for Mr. McCain as he sought to fight off the Tea Party movement, a groundswell he helped accelerate with his selection of Sarah Palin as his vice-presidential nominee in 2008. But in one of his last acts, he defied the far right \u2014 and President Trump, the man who had ridiculed his capture in Vietnam \u2014 by helping to derail the Republican drive to overturn the Affordable Care Act. Much of Mr. McCain\u2019s signature campaign finance overhaul has been undone by the courts. The nation\u2019s immigration problems remain unresolved and seem to defy legislative solutions despite his best efforts. And the famous deal to preserve the judicial filibuster has long since dissolved. But his impact on the Senate, his influence on his colleagues, and the force of his will won\u2019t be forgotten. \u201cThe lions are gone,\u201d Ms. Collins said. \u201cThe lions of the Senate are gone. It is very sad.\u201d",

      "author": "",
      "content": "I covered three of Senator McCain\u2019s political races \u2014 his 2008 White House race, and his 2010 and 2016 Senate re-election campaigns \u2014 and each time two Mr. McCains would show up. The first Mr. McCain was the one the public saw a lot on television: irreverent, cheerful, reverential \u2014 of veterans, senior voters, Gold Star mothers, small-business owners \u2014 and thoughtful about policy. That man dominated his successful attempt to capture the 2008 South Carolina primary, a candidate of boundless energy soaking up a blur of V.F.W. halls, vinegar barbecue joints and endless rounds of TV golf watched with Senator Lindsey Graham in the back of a bus. Reporters dragging themselves to a 6 a.m. van call would find Mr. McCain fully caffeinated, probably from a breakfast with a donor an hour earlier. \u201cCome on, jerks!\u201d Mr. McCain would bellow, his grinning, pink face poking out from under a hat. The other Mr. McCain, brooding, impatient and sometimes dismissive, seemed to surface when he was uncomfortable with the bend that politics had put in his road. In 2010, when confronted by voters who questioned Barack Obama\u2019s birthplace, that Mr. McCain stared at the floor uncomfortably, unlike the one in 2008 who had steadfastly defended his opponent. As I observed him under the relentless sun of southern Arizona trying to defend his multiple immigration positions, he shot me the occasional stony glare. [Read the obituary for John McCain, who endured five years of captivity in Vietnam and rose to the heights of power in Washington] The two Mr. McCains surfaced on Capitol Hill over the seven years I covered him there, too. In 2015, I went to his office to discuss a large defense bill, which he would only do after I spent a good 30 minutes sitting on his couch looking at photos of Native Americans taken by his idol, Barry Goldwater. Months later, relentlessly questioned about Mr. Trump, whose fortunes had entangled his own, he would no longer talk to me about much of anything. He scowled and loped away in that specific Mr. McCain way, one arm \u2014 the one injured by torture \u2014 slightly behind the velocity of the rest of him. In South Carolina once, he sat quietly in a chair waiting to do a remote television interview with a reporter back in Washington. Spying me spying him from a corner of the room, he said, eyes fixed on the monitor before him, \u201cWill you come back and see me again, Jennifer?\u201d When I assured him that I certainly would, he asked quietly, \u201cWill you come back even if I fail?\u201d \u2014 Jennifer Steinhauer In January 2015, when Mr. McCain had just taken over the chairmanship of the Senate Armed Services Committee \u2014 \u201cthe only job in Washington, other than being president, that he ever wanted,\u201d I wrote then \u2014 I ran into him practically skipping along in a Senate corridor. We hadn't seen one another in some time. \u201cCome see me!\" he said playfully. So I did. When I showed up at his office some days later for our interview, I found the senator in a contemplative mood. Mr. McCain, then 78, was never given to introspection, and on that day, he was combative \u2014 he said he would have \u201cof course\u201d made a better commander in chief than then-President Barack Obama \u2014 yet also unusually reflective. He told me that one by one, his fellow prisoners from the Vietnam War had been dying, and that he was acutely aware that one day, his time would come. \u201cEvery single day,\u201d he said then, \u201cis a day less that I am going to be able to serve in the Senate.\u201d I asked him what he wanted written on his tombstone. He didn\u2019t skip a beat: \u201cHe served his country.\u201d \u2014 Sheryl Gay Stolberg I was 16 years old. My older brother Dave was graduating from the U.S. Naval Academy with the Class of 1993. Before the ceremony I asked him who the speaker would be, hoping it would be somebody \u201cbig\u201d like the young new president, Bill Clinton. He replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know. Some senator from Arizona, I think.\u201d I was disappointed, but that changed when Senator McCain took the podium. I sat spellbound, and by the end of his speech I was ready to drop out of high school and enlist. Two years later, I entered the Naval Academy as a midshipman myself. Looking back, I thought it was strange that Senator McCain said, \u201cMy time is slipping by. Yours is fast approaching.\u201d It sounded like he was ready to retire then, but 15 years later he ran for president. Had he won he would have given another commencement speech at the academy as commander in chief, just as Dwight D. Eisenhower had spoken at his own in 1958. \u2014 John Ismay I was on an Easter-week trip to Vietnam in April 2000 with my wife, Angela, and my 18-month-old daughter, Caroline, when an editor on the foreign desk of The Times reached me at my hotel in Hanoi. Would I rush over to the Hoa Lo prison, a French colonial-era fortress known in the United States as the Hanoi Hilton, where a young aviator and future senator, John McCain, had been an inmate? Mr. McCain was visiting the prison, with his wife and 13-year-old son, Jack. Interrupted vacations are an occupational hazard for foreign correspondents. But it was hard to complain about this assignment. Mr. McCain had withdrawn from the Republican primary only a month earlier, after losing to George W. Bush, and he was still a bona fide political star. I got to the jail minutes before the senator, who was trailed by a small retinue of journalists from Washington. He welcomed me to the scrum. Mr. McCain had visited the Hanoi Hilton on one of his earlier trips to Vietnam since his release in 1973, so the story was really his son. \u201cIt\u2019s always interesting for me to be back here and show my son the place where I lived for a long time,\u201d Mr. McCain said, pausing before a faded picture of himself as a grim-faced, defiant prisoner. The tour was over in less than an hour. That evening, I wrote the story on a flight back to my base in Hong Kong. The image that stayed with me was Mr. McCain showing his son around as if the prison were his alma mater. \u201cExcept,\u201d I wrote, \u201cthe landmarks on this tour were dank cells like the one where Mr. McCain spent two years in solitary confinement, and leg irons, which he once wore as a punishment for insulting the guards.\u201d \u2014 Mark Landler John McCain was doing debate prep. That\u2019s what the handful of reporters traveling with the senator were told on the morning of Sept. 24, 2008. But as we gathered at the Morgan Library in New York City that morning, it was clear something was off. Mark Salter, the senator\u2019s top adviser and speechwriter, was pacing faster than normal, two cellphones pressed to his head as he went in and out of the room where Mr. McCain and his campaign staff were holed up. In fact, what we didn\u2019t know at the time was that the senator was planning what would become one of the most significant moments of his presidential campaign. At 1:55 p.m., we were hustled out of the library and arrived at the New York Hilton 15  minutes later, to be ushered into a small room where a podium and teleprompter were set up. That was a red flag; Mr. McCain was famous for speaking from the gut and rarely delivering prepared remarks. It was a grim-faced McCain who entered a few minutes later to begin delivering what the campaign described as a statement about the economy, which days earlier had begun collapsing. \u201cTomorrow morning, I will suspend my campaign and return to Washington.\u201d (I emailed my colleagues at 2:46 p.m.: \u201cMcCain suspending campaign. Asking for delay in debate.\u201d The responses I got: \u201c???,\u201d wrote Anne Kornblut; \u201cSeriously?\u201d said Jonathan Weisman; and \u201cwhat???\u201d asked Steven Ginsberg.) Mr. McCain had bet that a return to Washington to help pass an economic recovery bill in Congress might help his struggling campaign against Barack Obama. The look on his face that day suggested that he knew it might not. And his plans to shake up the race began unraveling almost immediately, when Mr. Obama shrewdly refused Mr. McCain\u2019s request to \u201cdelay Friday night\u2019s debate until we have taken action to address this crisis.\u201d I\u2019ve always believed that Sept. 24 was the day that cemented his loss. In the face of the economic crisis, Mr. McCain\u2019s campaign seemed off-balance and uncertain. Mr. McCain returned to Washington, but it was unclear what he was supposed to do when he got there. He had called for a meeting with President George W. Bush and Mr. Obama, but when details of the meeting were quickly leaked out, they revealed that Mr. Obama had taken charge while Mr. McCain was largely silent. \u2014 Michael D. Shear Mr. McCain rarely spoke in detail of his torture at the hands of his North Vietnamese captors between 1967 and 1973, but his experience informed his dogged public battle to keep the United States from embracing similar interrogation methods, even when others in his party went in a different direction. When national security hawks without his experience protested that Al Qaeda was unrestrained in their brutality, Mr. McCain would reply: \u201cIt\u2019s not about who they are. It\u2019s about who we are.\u201d In 2005, Mr. McCain spoke at the funeral of William P. Lawrence, a retired vice admiral who, like the senator, had been held by the North Vietnamese for six years. At the pulpit of the Naval Academy in Annapolis, he gathered 23 other men who had been prisoners of war in Vietnam and declared: \u201cAll of us share the bond that was formed many years ago and far away. We had the immense privilege of serving in the company of heroes.\u201d When Mr. McCain ejected from his disabled jet, was injured on landing and then beaten, he was dragged to a small cell already occupied by another American, George E. Day, who thought Mr. McCain might not survive a day. \u201cHe was horribly injured,\u201d Mr. Day recounted in 2005. \u201cHe had a fractured right arm, his left arm was out of the socket, his right knee was fractured, and they\u2019d bayoneted his left leg. The Vietnamese were trying to get him to make some antiwar statements, and he\u2019d refused.\u201d Mr. McCain resisted his captors\u2019 threats and bribes, including an offer of early release, sometimes with grim wit; once, when they demanded the names of members of his squadron, he listed the Green Bay Packers\u2019 offensive line. After days of torture, Mr. McCain finally signed a confession to being a \u201cblack criminal\u201d and \u201cair pirate,\u201d deliberately lacing his statement with grammatical errors and communist jargon to show it was coerced. His cellmate for the last two years, Jack Fellowes, explained that such minimal accommodations were necessary for survival. \u201cJohn McCain bent a little \u2014 we all bent a little \u2014 but he never broke,\u201d he said. The experience led to Mr. McCain\u2019s fight for passage, in late 2005, of what was called the McCain Amendment, banning the inhumane treatment of prisoners. It was his response to the revelation that the C.I.A., with the approval of President George W. Bush, had used on Al Qaeda prisoners a range of brutal interrogation methods, including waterboarding, that the United States had long considered torture. \u201cHe saw the blood lust that those who tortured him displayed,\u201d Robert Timberg, a Naval Academy graduate, Vietnam veteran and McCain biographer, said at the time. \u201cThe idea that a torturer could have an American face is difficult for him to handle.\u201d \u2014 Scott Shane",

      "author": "Julie Hirschfeld Davis",
      "content": "   \u2022 Senator John McCain is lying in state in the Rotunda of the United States Capitol, the 31st person to receive that honor. \u2022 Elected officials and the cabinet had a chance to pay their respects in a ceremony at 11 a.m. Vice President Mike Pence spoke on behalf of the Trump administration at a Capitol ceremony honoring Mr. McCain, who did not want President Trump to attend his funeral remembrances. \u2022 The Rotunda is now open for public viewing: A line snaking three rows of barricades stretched down the street by noon, as hundreds waited to pay their respects to the senator. Groups of sailors, wearing their dress whites, dotted the crowds and many held umbrellas aloft to shield themselves from the sun. Vice President Pence opened his speech by crediting the president who was excluded from the proceedings with his presence: \u201cThe president asked me to be here on behalf of a grateful nation, to pay a debt of honor and respect to a man who served his country throughout his life.\u201d Mr. Pence and Senator McCain joined together in the past to fight earmarks and on other fiscal issues while Mr. Pence was a conservative leader \u2014 and a bit of a maverick himself \u2014 in the House. The vice president, who almost always begins his remarks bringing greetings from Mr. Trump, was in the awkward position of having to eulogize a man whom the president has studiously avoided praising in the days since his death. With Mr. McCain\u2019s grief-stricken daughter Meghan McCain looking on with an icy gaze, Mr. Pence mustered one positive comment, referencing a remark from Mr. Trump during an interview with Bloomberg on Thursday: \u201cAs President Trump said yesterday,\u201d he offered, \u201cwe respect his service to the country.\u201d For his own part, Mr. Pence praised Mr. McCain for his \u201ciron will,\u201d and called him a \u201cpatriot,\u201d while alluding to the fact that they had many differences. \u201cIn my years in Congress and as vice president, we didn\u2019t always agree either, and he almost always noticed,\u201d Mr. Pence said. \u201cBut his support for limited government, for tax reform, and support for our armed forces surely made our nation more prosperous and more secure, and he will be missed.\u201d During a week when former colleagues and aides have spoken admiringly of Mr. McCain\u2019s stamina, Mr. Pence also recalled traveling with the senator \u2014 more than 20 years his senior \u2014 in Iraq and falling asleep in the middle of a dinner with Iraqi officials. Mr. McCain, the vice president said, walked up to him and suggested that he skip the rest of the scheduled meetings that night and go to bed, saying, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you turn in? You look like you could use some rest.\u201d \u201cI never traveled with a colleague who was better to our enlisted, or harder on our generals,\u201d Mr. Pence said. Among the attendees at Friday\u2019s ceremony at the Rotunda was Roberta McCain, Mr. McCain\u2019s 106-year-old mother, who sat stoically gazing at the flag-draped coffin bearing the remains of the son she knew as \u201cJohnny.\u201d Ms. McCain, dressed in black pants and a sheer white blouse that matched the snow-white of her perfectly coifed hair, appeared poised and serene during the service. At one point she reached out to grasp the hand of her granddaughter Meghan McCain who sat weeping beside her. Using a wheelchair to make her way to the center of the Rotunda, Ms. McCain crossed herself silently at the senator\u2019s coffin. Mr. McCain wrote in his 2005 book \u201cCharacter is Destiny\u201d that his mother and her identical twin sister, Rowena \u2014 now deceased \u2014 \u201cwere renowned for their beauty, which has hardly faded over the years that have passed since heads first turned in their direction. But their personalities have always been their most attractive feature.\u201d He wrote that Ms. McCain had been \u201craised to be a strong, determined woman who thoroughly enjoyed life, and always tried to make the most of her opportunities.\u201d At the White House, President Trump remained eerily quiet during the morning, and throughout the Capitol service for Mr. McCain. He did not tweet. The special split-screen televisions in the press areas of the West Wing showed the same thing on each of the four news networks: live coverage of the service. But White House officials said they did not know whether Mr. Trump was watching. The president was scheduled to leave the White House just before 1 p.m. for a trip to North Carolina before returning to Washington for what is expected to be a soggy weekend. A spokeswoman said the president has no public events on the schedule for the long, holiday weekend. \u2014 Michael D. Shear Tai Bui, 79, of Maryland, had a very simple answer for why he was willing to wait in a long, hot line to see Mr. McCain: without the senator, he would not have been able to immigrate to the United States. Mr. Bui, born in Vietnam, aided American troops in their fight against the communists during the same war Mr. McCain fought in. His role in the war gave him a feeling of kinship with Mr. McCain: he too was imprisoned as punishment. \u201cI was put in a concentration camp for five years,\u201d he said. \u201cMr. McCain, too.\u201d Twenty years ago, he was able to come to the United States with his wife, thanks to the Arizona senator\u2019s efforts to help Vietnamese refugees relocate and reunite with their families. When asked about the complex relationship Mr. McCain had with his country, Mr. Bui shook his head and answered emphatically: \u201cHe\u2019s a hero. No question about it.\u201d \u2014 Catie Edmondson After arriving in Washington earlier this week for a semester of classes and internships, a group of students from Marquette University agreed to upend their planned schedule and attend the memorial in the Rotunda. \u201cWe thought we\u2019d come live history,\u201d said Sean Jettner, a 20-year-old criminology and political science major. \u201cJust because he lived in a different time,\u201d he added. \u201cWhatever he proposes lives on.\u201d Standing in a clump in the sweltering Washington heat, six of the 16 students standing the line agreed that Mr. McCain\u2019s legacy carried a different meaning for them than their parents, who passed along prayer requests for a politician they had followed for decades. Mr. McCain\u2019s 2008 campaign for president was the first campaign the students all remembered \u2014 and his respect for opinions different from his own, they said, was something they were not accustomed to in Washington. \u201cHe muddied the lines of the political parties,\u201d said Alec Bodendorfer, 21, a political science and economics senior. \u201cThat\u2019s probably the coolest thing about him.\u201d The diversity of the line in age and background was a relief, they said, and an example of the political legacy they hoped to see more of in the future. \u201cThey\u2019re able to set aside their differences and remember,\u201d said Matt Rabinovitch, 21. \u201cThis is America.\u201d \u201cWe can still come together on one thing,\u201d Mr. Jettner added. Mr. Pence was not the only person representing the Trump administration in the Rotunda on Friday. John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff, stood stony-faced at the ceremony. Kellyanne Conway, the counselor to the president, was nearby, at one point chatting amiably with Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general overseeing the special counsel investigation into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 presidential election, which Mr. Trump routinely decries as a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d Jeff Sessions, the attorney general whom Mr. Trump has berated publicly and privately for recusing himself from that probe \u2014 but praised during an interview on Thursday \u2014 was also present to honor a senator with whom he served. So was Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence whose conclusions Mr. Trump has publicly questioned, and who is also a former senator from Indiana. National security leaders who dealt extensively with Mr. McCain during his many on the Armed Services Committee also came to see him lying in state, including Jim Mattis, the secretary of defense; John R. Bolton, Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser; and Heather Wilson, the secretary of the Air Force and a former House representative from New Mexico. Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican and majority leader, and Mr. McCain had a tempestuous relationship over their careers, fighting about campaign finance laws all the way to the Supreme Court. Mr. McCain was not easily led and Mr. McConnell\u2019s job was to lead. But they repaired any lingering damage in recent years and settled into a comfortable camaraderie that was upended a bit by Mr. McCain\u2019s decision to oppose Mr. McConnell\u2019s drive to repeal the new health care law. Still, there was a strong mutual respect for the abilities of one another. Mr. McConnell proudly took note of the occasional difficulties of dealing with John McCain. [From the Arizona State Capitol to Washington National Cathedral, John McCain will be honored in a series of memorial services this week. Here are vignettes of the ceremony and sentiment.] \u201cHe treated every issue with the intensity the people\u2019s business deserves,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201cHe would fight tooth and nail for his vision of the common good. Depending on the issue, you knew John would either be your staunchest ally or your most stubborn opponent.\u201d Speaker Paul D. Ryan was among those remembering Mr. McCain\u2019s fighting streak with fondness. \u201cI myself, from time to time, found myself on the receiving end of John\u2019s distinct brand of candor \u2014 happily so,\u201d Mr. Ryan said. \u201cI remember thinking more than once, \u2018Yeah, he really does talk like a sailor.\u2019 \u201d \u201cWith John, it was never feigned disagreement,\u201d he added. \u201cThe man didn\u2019t feign anything \u2014 he just relished the fight.\u201d Mr. Ryan quoted a passage from one of Mr. McCain\u2019s favorite authors, Ernest Hemingway, who wrote in \u201cA Farewell to Arms\u201d about how people grow \u201cstrong at the broken places,\u201d a trait he said the senator embodied. \u201cThough the highest office eluded him,\u201d Mr. Ryan said, \u201che attained what is far more enduring: the abiding affection of his fellow citizens and an example for future generations.\u201d Anna Marie Farone had never followed Senator McCain\u2019s political or professional career before 2017. She knew he ran against President Barack Obama, but did not cast a vote. But Ms. Farone, 33, who suffers from a degenerative spine condition, avidly watched the debate over the repeal of the Affordable Care Act and celebrated when Mr. McCain made his dramatic thumbs-down vote on the Senate floor last summer, preserving the health care law. It was that vote that led her to travel to Washington for the first time since the Clinton administration \u2014 a 19-hour trip from Indianapolis that included a missed Greyhound connection and a last-minute flight out of Pittsburgh \u2014 and be the first in line outside the Capitol to make it into the Rotunda to pay her respects. \u201cIt was that one ACA vote,\u201d said the freelancer and urban farmer, who arrived outside the Capitol Visitor Center Friday just six hours after reaching Washington. \u201cHe did side with the humans when it mattered.\u201d And while Ms. Farone disagreed with some of his other votes, including his support for last year\u2019s Republican tax overhaul, she said she wanted to celebrate his willingness to work for bipartisan measures. \u201cHe may not have always done it right, but he did it well\u201d she said. \u201cHe was human.\u201d Behind her, dozens of people had started to gather in line to wait to pay their respects later this afternoon \u2014 sprawled out on beach towels and huddled under umbrellas that protected them from first the sweltering early morning heat and then scattered rain. \u201cLook at how willing everyone is to uplift him,\u201d Ms. Farone said. \u201cHe\u2019s not deceased as so much converted into a legend. A person of the ages.\u201d Carmine Garritano, 71, was one of several veterans who gathered outside, wearing symbols of the armed service they shared with Mr. McCain: hats from the Veterans of Foreign Wars and the American Legion, uniform hats and vests studded with badges and buttons reflective of their service. Mr. Garritano, a retired Army specialist, had served in Vietnam, but his time in the country overlapped with only a fraction of Mr. McCain\u2019s time as a prisoner of war. He had tried for years to find an opportunity to meet Mr. McCain in Washington. Instead, he drove down from New York with his daughter to pay his respects in the Capitol Rotunda. \u201cI wanted to come down and shake his hand, and say thank you,\u201d Mr. Garritano said, his voice shaking with emotion. \u201cThis is the least I could do,\u201d he concluded. As he wiped away a tear, another veteran, in a dress shirt and an American Legion hat, silently embraced him in the line. David Alvarez, 72, was 18 when he began his first tour with the Marine Corps in Vietnam. That experience, coupled with years spent outside the Senate doors as a Capitol Police officer gave him a kinship, he said, with Mr. McCain. \u201cI feel honored to be here,\u201d he said. Though there were at least a hundred people standing between him and the doors to the Capitol, he already grew emotional at the thought of what he would say before Mr. McCain\u2019s coffin. \u201cThank you for your service,\u201d he said, clapping his Vietnam Veterans cap to his chest. \u201cThen, slow salute,\u201d he added. Kyle Moses, an Army major stationed at Fort Meade, brought his young son Sam along to pay their respects to the senator he believed \u201cwas always looking out for the military.\u201d \u201cIt does make me think, \u2018Is this the end of an era?\u2019\u201d he said, looking down at his son, who was clutching a stuffed animal. \u201cI hope it\u2019s a good inflection point and not a bad one. I hope we swing back to the way that the senator conducted himself.\u201d Several of the people who gathered hours before the doors were opened to the public identified themselves as proud Democrats, who had never voted for Mr. McCain or frequently disagreed with his policies. With sharp criticism of the current administration and the polarization in Congress, they agreed that he was the last one of the last politicians willing to take bipartisan steps. \u201cWe lost a good one in John,\u201d said Kitt Rodkey, 64, who took a personal day from work to pay his respects to Mr. McCain. \u201cNo one is perfect, but he came pretty close.\u201d Standing next to him, Cooper Brockington, a therapist from Reston, Va., nodded emphatically as she fanned herself in the humidity. \u201cWe are all family,\u201d she said. \u201cI believe in paying my respect to our great servants.\u201d She had been to the Capitol for both Rosa Parks and Billy Graham\u2019s ceremonies in the Capitol, and saw this as another opportunity to recognize Mr. McCain\u2019s service in government and in war. \u201cWe\u2019re all saddened,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we\u2019re all inspired, to do more and be more.\u201d Mourners from across the country and across the political spectrum gathered in the Rotunda to remember Mr. McCain. The actor Warren Beatty, whom Mr. McCain chose as a pallbearer, and his wife, the actor Annette Benning, made their way through the basement of the Capitol Wednesday morning on their way to the ceremony. Henry A. Kissinger, the former Secretary of State and national security adviser, said the ceremony for a man he considered a friend for 50 years was moving. \u201cIt was a great honor,\u201d Mr. Kissinger, who is 95, said as he left the Capitol, \u201cto be able to say goodbye.\u201d Senator Pat Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, caught up with Chuck Robb, a former Democratic senator from Virginia, outside the Old Senate Chamber. A few steps away, Mr. McConnell, who will deliver remarks at the service, got a rundown of the choreography of the day from an aide. Mitt Romney, the former Republican presidential nominee and current candidate for Senate, was spotted downstairs as was Governor Rick Scott of Florida, who is running to join the Senate. Military commanders and members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as well as members of the House and Senate, began taking their places in the Rotunda, its doorways draped in black crepe, as Mr. Pence\u2019s motorcade made its way to the Capitol. The Lincoln Catafalque sat directly under the Capitol dome awaiting the arrival of Mr. McCain\u2019s coffin. High above it, a camera had been fitted to capture an aerial shot of a historic day. As if on cue, a steady rain began to fall as military pallbearers removed the coffin bearing Mr. McCain\u2019s body from the hearse and began to carry it up the steps to the Capitol, with his family looking on. Among those spotted standing in a cluster awaiting the arrival of the coffin in the Rotunda: John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff, Jeff Sessions, the attorney general, and Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general. Mr. Pence is a logical choice to speak at the Capitol ceremony for Mr. McCain given the president\u2019s absence. As vice president, Mr. Pence also serves as president of the Senate. But Mr. Pence also has a more personal connection to Mr. McCain, with whom he served when he was a member of the House. Together with a band of like-minded fiscal conservatives, they collaborated in 2005 in an effort to force Mr. Bush, the president at the time, to swallow steep spending cuts to pay for a $62 billion emergency funding bill enacted to repair the damage from Hurricane Katrina. Mr. Pence was then the chairman of the Republican Study Committee, a group of conservatives in the House that routinely railed against excessive spending. Mr. McCain was a seasoned senator who had made a trademark of his opposition to spending earmarks and what he called \u201cpork\u201d \u2014 line items lawmakers would insert in spending bills to fund strictly parochial projects. Their styles could not have been more different. Mr. Pence was a fresh-faced religious conservative with the earnest delivery of a radio host, Mr. McCain the sometimes irascible and profane maverick who liked to forge bipartisan alliances. But their shared passion for fiscal restraint threw them together in a fight that cleaved their party. The two would clash on other issues, most notably Mr. Trump\u2019s effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which Mr. McCain opposed despite a personal appeal from Mr. Pence on the Senate floor. But the vice president has praised Mr. McCain effusively since his death, something Mr. Trump has refused to do.",

      "author": "Sheryl Gay Stolberg",
      "content": " Some days, it seems as if every Democrat running for president is vying to be the next John McCain. John Edwards, now a Washington insider, plays the outsider. John Kerry, Vietnam veteran, stresses foreign affairs. Joseph I. Lieberman antagonizes party loyalists. Howard Dean bucks the establishment. Richard A. Gephardt hits populist themes. Wesley K. Clark promotes his military record. Each wants, desperately, to repeat Senator McCain's stunning victory in the Republican primary in New Hampshire in 2000. From his perch in the Senate, the real McCoy, er, McCain, watches this parade of Democratic imitators with quiet bemusement. To those who would emulate his tactics and style, he offers the kind of plain talk that helped catapult him, albeit briefly, to the head of the Republican pack. ''I'm flattered,'' Mr. McCain said simply. ''And of course, I'm also entertained, by the fact that they seem to ignore the reality that I lost.'' Until now, Mr. McCain, the Arizona Republican whose political attraction rests, in part, on a biography that includes more than five years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, has assiduously avoided sharing his views about the 2004 presidential race. He is friendly with Senators Kerry, Edwards and Lieberman -- all of whom, he said, have occasionally sought his advice -- and does not want to appear to take sides. But for nearly an hour last week, the senator sat in his sun-dappled office and reflected on elections past and future, assessing the Democratic field as well as the man whose ride to the White House he once hoped to derail, President Bush. The Democratic contenders, Mr. McCain said, have had a hard time differentiating themselves, and he does not see any appealing to the same independent voters he did. He did have a tip for how they might break out of the pack: skip the Iowa caucuses, as he did, and focus on New Hampshire. The senator also had words of caution for the newest entrant in the race, General Clark. ''People will come and listen to you on the basis of what you've done for the country,'' Mr. McCain said, twirling a pen in his left hand as he spoke. ''But they only will vote for you on the basis of what they believe you will do for the country.'' Of all the Democrats, Dr. Dean, who has generated huge crowds and whipped up enthusiasm among those who say they have felt left out of the political process, is perhaps the most often compared to Mr. McCain. But the comparison seems to irk the senator, who said Dr. Dean's national security positions ''are way out of the mainstream.'' For instance, Mr. McCain cited Dr. Dean's remark that ''the ends do not justify the means,'' in reference to the death of Saddam Hussein's sons. ''I was astounded,'' the senator said. ''The ends were to get rid of two murdering rapist thugs and the means was the use of American military intelligence.'' The comparison to Dr. Dean came up a few weeks ago, when Mr. McCain, who is up for re-election in 2004, was in Seattle for a fund-raiser with a small group of his supporters. Rick Davis, Mr. McCain's former campaign manager, who was at the fund-raiser recalled the senator asking whether Dr. Dean had drawn in McCain backers. ''None of our people are particularly interested in Dean,'' Mr. Davis said. ''I think that was sort of an eye-opener for John.'' Though his friends say he has never really patched up relations with President Bush after their acrimonious 2000 campaign, Mr. McCain pledged to campaign for the president and said he would be a co-chairman for the Bush re-election effort in Arizona. Last week, as the Senate debated an $87 billion emergency spending measure for postwar Iraq and Afghanistan, Mr. McCain emerged as one of Mr. Bush's staunchest defenders on Capitol Hill. Even so, Mr. McCain was pointed in his criticism of the White House, leaving the distinct impression that his support for Mr. Bush's re-election stems less from enthusiasm for the president than from a desire to be a good Republican soldier. ''I'm not sure he's on the wrong course as perhaps at least not enough on the right course,'' Mr. McCain said of Mr. Bush, after ticking off a list of things he would do were he in the president's shoes. The list included announcing that tax cuts would not be made permanent, renewing a commitment to free trade and going ''back on national television'' to make a strong case for rebuilding Iraq. ''I think he needs to do those things,'' Mr. McCain said, ''to provide the kind of leadership that people will have confidence in.'' Such remarks are vintage McCain: blunt and revealing of a politician's ego. ''He came pretty close to upsetting a guy with all the money and all the governors and all the infrastructure,'' said Senator Chuck Hagel, the Nebraska Republican and a good friend of Mr. McCain's, ''and there surely is not a day that goes by that he doesn't think, 'If I was in that situation as president, I think I could do a better job.' '' There have long been mavericks in presidential politics; John Anderson and Ross Perot leap to mind. But at a time when the country is becoming more polarized, Mr. McCain is one of the most prominent politicians who draws support across party lines. Grover G. Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, deemed Mr. McCain irrelevant, calling him ''yesterday's news.'' But William Kristol, editor of The Weekly Standard, a conservative magazine, praised Mr. McCain as ''a great ally of the White House on Iraq.'' Bruce D. Merrill, a pollster and professor of mass communications at Arizona State University, sees Mr. McCain as the kind of candidate Americans yearn for but will not elect. ''The way the rules work,'' Mr. Merrill said, ''it's still the ideologues who control the nomination process. If John McCain could have gotten the nomination, he would have been elected president.'' But Mr. McCain could not get the nomination, a fact that is not lost on him or his supporters as they watch what John Weaver, Mr. McCain's political strategist in 2000, called the ''authenticity grab'' by Democrats trying to cloak themselves in the mantle of Mr. McCain. ''I think he feels like he's in a girdle, or he's constrained,'' said one person close to Mr. McCain. ''He sees a White House that he has domestic and foreign policy differences with, and then he sees candidates who he believes he's a better candidate than they are.'' If Mr. McCain believes that about the Democrats, he did not say, though he did say he sees them all ''trying very hard to somehow strike a chord.'' He declined to list strengths and weaknesses, and he steered especially clear of talking about his friends Senators Kerry and Edwards and Lieberman. He said they call on him for advice now and then. ''They don't ask, 'What do you think I should do on such and such an issue?' '' he said. ''It's sort of, 'How am I doing tactically?' Or they ask me, 'What do you think about Arizona?' '' Mr. McCain confessed to feeling an occasional twinge that the 2004 race is unfolding without him, and his eyes came alive when he talked of his own presidential campaign, which he described as ''the most enjoyable experience of my life.'' The memories are still fresh, from the early town hall meeting in New Hampshire where ''20 people showed up and we gave away free ice cream'' to arriving by boat into the port in Bremerton, Wash., with 5,000 people waiting for him in the rain and the cold. Yet Mr. McCain does not sound interested in a second bid for the White House. He shook his head when asked why he was not running as an independent this year and said he had no intention to run in 2008. As the interview drew to a close, Mr. McCain pointed out a bust of his hero, Theodore Roosevelt, who famously ran as an independent and lost. Then he was asked what he thought the headline for the story should be. He replied, not skipping a beat, ''Gone but not forgotten.''",

      "author": "Maggie Haberman",
      "content": "  The White House asked the Navy to hide a destroyer named after Senator John McCain in order to avoid having the ship appear in photographs taken while President Trump was visiting Japan this week, White House and military officials said Wednesday. Although Navy officials insisted they did not hide the ship, the John S. McCain, they did give all of the sailors aboard the day off on Tuesday as Mr. Trump visited Yokosuka Naval Base. Two Navy sailors, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, said that the McCain sailors were not invited to hear Mr. Trump speak that day aboard the amphibious assault ship Wasp, while sailors from other American warships at the base were. [What you need to know about about the U.S.S. John S. McCain] A Navy service member based on Yokosuka said that all of the American warships in the harbor were invited to send 60 to 70 sailors to hear Mr. Trump\u2019s address, with the exception of the McCain. When several sailors from the McCain showed up anyway, wearing their uniforms with the ship\u2019s insignia, they were turned away, the service member said. White House aides, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not permitted to speak publicly, confirmed the request was made but said that Mr. Trump did not know about it. A United States official said on Wednesday that the White House sent an email to the Navy with the request on May 15. But the president denied on Twitter on Wednesday night having any involvement: \u201cI was not informed about anything having to do with the Navy Ship USS John S. McCain during my recent visit to Japan.\u201d [Here\u2019s the latest on what President Trump said about efforts to hide the Navy destroyer.] Mr. McCain, of Arizona, who died last year from brain cancer, was derided repeatedly during his life by Mr. Trump, who once disparaged Mr. McCain\u2019s service because he had been held as a war prisoner in Vietnam, saying, \u201cI like people who weren\u2019t captured.\u201d The president\u2019s animosity toward the senator did not subside with his death. Navy officials approached last week by The New York Times about plans for the McCain during Mr. Trump\u2019s visit declined to comment. But one official said on Thursday that sailors aboard the destroyer were told to hide signs that identified that warship during Mr. Trump\u2019s visit. The White House request to hide the name of Mr. Trump\u2019s rival, first reported by The Wall Street Journal, is the second episode to engulf the Navy in Mr. Trump\u2019s single visit to the Wasp. At least a few service members wore round patches emblazoned with a likeness of Mr. Trump and the words \u201cMake Aircrew Great Again\u201d \u2014 a play on the president\u2019s campaign slogan \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d \u2014 on their flight suits while listening to their commander in chief speak. Images of the patches promptly went viral. \u201cThey\u2019re inappropriate & against regulation,\u201d tweeted Mark Hertling, a retired three-star Army general. Just days later, the Navy was embroiled in the McCain news. \u201cAll ships remained in normal configuration during the president\u2019s visit,\u201d said Cmdr. Nate Christensen, a Navy spokesman. The acting defense secretary, Patrick Shanahan, denied knowledge of the White House request. \u201cWhen I read about it this morning, it was the first I\u2019ve heard about it,\u201d he told reporters on Thursday during an appearance with his Indonesian counterpart in Jakarta. Asked if he planned to order an investigation into the matter, he said, \u201cI want to find out a little bit more.\u201d The Wasp, an amphibious assault ship that hosts the new F-35B Lightning fighter jets, had actually been in Sasebo, Japan, and was moved to Yokosuka in time for the president\u2019s visit. [Sign up for the weekly At War newsletter to receive stories about the military, conflict and consequence.] The Chief of Naval Information, the public affairs arm of the Navy, posted on Twitter for the first time in five and a half years over the matter. \u201cThe name of the U.S.S. John S. McCain was not obscured during the POTUS visit to Yokosuka on Memorial Day,\u201d the Navy said, using an acronym for president of the United States. Mr. Shanahan later told reporters aboard his flight to Singapore that he was going to ask his chief of staff to look into what happened. \u201cI would never dishonor the memory of a great American patriot like Senator McCain,\u201d he said. He also added that \u201cI\u2019d never disrespect the young men and women that crew that ship,\u201d a reference to reports that sailors from the McCain who were wearing uniforms with the ship\u2019s insignia were turned away from Mr. Trump\u2019s speech. The disclosure that the Navy entertained a request to hide a warship named after an American war hero from a president who did not serve is likely to resurface questions about whether Mr. Trump has politicized the military. Mr. Shanahan, the president\u2019s pick to become defense secretary \u2014 and who will soon be visiting Tokyo after his time in Jakarta \u2014 has taken pains  to go along with White House requests, many of which were delayed by his predecessor, Jim Mattis. But this effort could make Mr. Shanahan\u2019s confirmation fight in Congress more difficult. The destroyer John S. McCain is named after the senator, as well as his grandfather, John S. McCain Sr., a Navy admiral during World War II, and his father, John S. McCain Jr., an admiral in the Vietnam era. Meghan McCain, John McCain\u2019s daughter, spoke out on Twitter on Wednesday night against the White House request. Ms. McCain, who has rebuked the president over how he has spoken about her father, wrote that Mr. Trump was \u201cthreatened by the greatness of my dads incredible life,\u201d adding that in the \u201cnine months since he passed, Trump won\u2019t let him RIP.\u201d",
