      "content": " It has been a long road for Hillary Clinton \u2014 former first lady, senator and secretary of state \u2014 since she announced her presidential bid more than a year and a half ago. Here\u2019s a look at notable moments and missteps of her campaign. Hillary Clinton joined the presidential race in April 2015, ending two years of demurrals and instantly taking the lead in the contest to become the Democratic nominee. It was seven years after she lost the Democratic primary to Barack Obama. In a polished video announcing her candidacy she said, \u201cEveryday Americans need a champion, and I want to be that champion.\u201d Soon after, she slipped into a Chipotle restaurant in Ohio and ordered a chicken burrito bowl. She even carried her own tray. Was it a stunt to prove her commitment to ordinary American-ness, or does she just really like Chipotle? No journalists were present, and Mrs. Clinton, wearing sunglasses, went unrecognized. Even the staff did not know she had been there until a Times reporter called. Mrs. Clinton had a raw and unscripted exchange with a Black Lives Matter activist who cornered her over her support for criminal justice policies enacted during her husband\u2019s presidency. She challenged the much younger man to channel his passion into policy change. Mrs. Clinton long resisted her aides\u2019 suggestion that she apologize for using a private email server while at the State Department, insisting the scandal had been manufactured by her political opponents and the news media. It was a high-profile example of her instinct to dig in and cede no ground when under attack. In September she finally changed course, calling her email practices \u201ca mistake\u201d and adding, \u201cI\u2019m sorry about that.\u201d The mothers of Michael Brown, Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner, Tamir Rice and a half-dozen other black men killed by the police or in gun violence emerged as powerful surrogates for Mrs. Clinton after she asked them to tell her their stories at a three-hour dinner in Chicago. \u201cShe took her pad and her ink pen, she wrote her own notes, and she asked us what did we need,\u201d one mother said. Mrs. Clinton effectively defeated the insurgent  campaign of Senator Bernie Sanders after she won a string of Democratic primaries across the Northeast, allowing her to shift her attention to the general election. From this moment she focused on Donald J. Trump and, to a lesser extent, Senator Ted Cruz. Mrs. Clinton delivered a pointed attack on Mr. Trump in a speech in San Diego, describing him as a childish, reckless, uninformed and mentally unhinged amateur. She said he would pose a danger to both the United States and the world if he were to be elected president. She said his foreign policy ideas were \u201cnot even really ideas, just a series of bizarre rants, personal feuds and outright lies.\u201d When she became the first woman to accept the presidential nomination of a major party in July, Mrs. Clinton warned of a \u201cmoment of reckoning.\u201d  \u201cPowerful forces are threatening to pull us apart, bonds of trust and respect are fraying,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd just as with our founders there are no guarantees. It truly is up to us. We have to decide whether we all will work together so we all can rise together.\u201d Mrs. Clinton criticized Mr. Trump for his campaign\u2019s embrace of the alt-right, a community of conspiracy theorists and white nationalists at the fringe of the conservative movement. She said Mr. Trump had adopted much of the alt-right\u2019s language of \u201cprejudice and paranoia\u201d and was \u201ctaking hate groups mainstream.\u201d Many on the alt-right reveled in the attention. Mrs. Clinton came under intense criticism after she described half of Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters as fitting into \u201cthe basket of deplorables\u201d to a laughing crowd at a Manhattan fund-raiser. Many of them are \u201cracist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic, you name it,\u201d she said. Mr. Trump said the remarks showed that Mrs. Clinton was disdainful of his white, economically hard-hit supporters. Mrs. Clinton faced more trouble when she was seen stumbling as she abruptly left a Sept. 11 memorial event early. She was then forced to admit that she had pneumonia. The episode scuttled her political strategy to cede the spotlight to Mr. Trump, stirred public doubts about her candor and gave new life to conspiracy theories about her health. Mrs. Clinton displayed a comfort with the ultrarich, embraced free trade, praised a budget-balancing plan that required Social Security cuts and reflected on her family\u2019s wealth in lucrative paid speeches she delivered to financial firms but refused to disclose to the public. The speeches, which contrasted with the liberal tenor of her campaign, were stolen by hackers and posted online by WikiLeaks. Mrs. Clinton responded cautiously to the increasing sexual assault accusations against Mr. Trump and the national debate over male privilege and sexual violence that followed. Her careful approach underlined her complicated place in feminist history as the first female presidential candidate who also played a role in rebutting accusations of sexual misconduct against her husband, Bill Clinton. Mrs. Clinton outmaneuvered Mr. Trump in the third presidential debate, mocking, needling and taunting him with a series of verbal surgical strikes that reflected an unexpected new approach: his own. She deployed some of his trademark tactics against him, tormenting him with a broad smile. Her opponent was left largely subdued and defanged.",

      "author": "Alexander Burns",
      "content": " Some debates seem to transform the fundamentals of a political campaign. The first clash between Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump was not one of those events. Rather than shifting the lines of the presidential race, this debate seems likely to deepen them \u2014 bolstering Mrs. Clinton\u2019s advantage on questions of temperament and tolerance, and amplifying Mr. Trump\u2019s blustery message of drastic change. But Mrs. Clinton appeared to gain in strength over the course of the debate, ultimately routing Mr. Trump in a series of late exchanges. Here are some of our key takeaways from the night: Mrs. Clinton seems to have bested Mr. Trump in the debate largely thanks to her mastery of three subjects that have defined her general election campaign: race, gender and national security. Breaking through in an exchange on race, she battered Mr. Trump for pushing what she called a \u201cracist lie\u201d that President Obama was born outside the United States. Assailing Mr. Trump as sexist, Mrs. Clinton quoted him calling women \u201cpigs, slobs and dogs.\u201d And in a back-and-forth on national security, she accused him repeatedly of risking \u201canother war\u201d with his hot temper, and said he could not be trusted with nuclear weapons. Mr. Trump struggled to answer the substance of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s criticism, and often appeared thrown by her attacks. His response on national security consisted largely of name-checking various global problem areas, like the Islamic State and Iran, without offering a pointed critique or alternative solution. In an uneven and at times flailing debate performance, Mr. Trump had a few moments of strength: He was at his best when he was bringing the fight to Mrs. Clinton on trade policy and her status as a political insider, and delivering blunt calls for wholesale upheaval in Washington. Mr. Trump hammered Mrs. Clinton early on as an avatar of the status quo. \u201cShe\u2019s been doing this for 30 years,\u201d Mr. Trump said repeatedly. Later, he charged: \u201cOur country is suffering because people like Secretary Clinton have made such bad decisions.\u201d But what Mr. Trump has not yet done is convince most Americans that he is the right alternative to a broken political system, and it\u2019s not likely he accomplished that on Monday. He shouted, interrupted and sniffed. She kept a level tone and wielded prefab one-liners. For all the policy disputes between Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton, it may be the vast difference in their personalities that leaves a deeper impression on voters. Mr. Trump, who dodged policy details, badgered Mrs. Clinton as he did his Republican primary opponents, cutting in to mock and contest her claims. He talked over Lester Holt, the moderator \u2014 a performance likely to reinforce his appeal to fans, but unlikely to dispatch doubts about his temperament. Mrs. Clinton was far more restrained: She declined to match Mr. Trump\u2019s volume when he yelled over her, and several times pointed viewers to the internet for fact-checking purposes, rather than going after Mr. Trump\u2019s misstatements herself. Notably, for a candidate who has strained to connect with voters on a gut level, Mrs. Clinton repeatedly invoked her father and granddaughter, in what seemed like an effort to cast her views in a more personal light. Mr. Trump has faced intensifying scrutiny in recent weeks for his practice of spreading incorrect or misleading information. But he was undeterred on Monday evening and again peddled false claims, including some of his most thoroughly debunked fables. In his leadoff answer, Mr. Trump warned that Ford was planning to slash thousands of American jobs to relocate small-car production to Mexico \u2013 a claim the company\u2019s chief executive has denied. Mr. Trump insisted that he had not called global warming a hoax perpetrated by China, though he has said precisely that on Twitter. And Mr. Trump repeated numerous times that he was against the war in Iraq from the start, which is plainly contrary to the facts. Mr. Holt, the staid NBC anchor moderating the debate, stepped in at one point to observe that Mr. Trump had not originally opposed the war. Perhaps surprisingly, Mrs. Clinton allowed several of Mr. Trump\u2019s claims to go unchallenged in their specifics. There were a few glaring omissions from the list of issues covered in the debate \u2013 including, remarkably, the defining issue of Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy. Immigration did not come up even once. Mr. Trump didn\u2019t raise it, and neither Mrs. Clinton nor Mr. Holt challenged him on the subject. While Mrs. Clinton criticized Mr. Trump for demonizing Muslims, neither she nor anyone else mentioned a signature Trump proposal from the Republican primaries, to ban all Muslim immigration to the United States. And in an oversight that would have been unthinkable for any conventional Republican candidate, Mr. Trump did not even mention the Affordable Care Act or the word \u201cObamacare,\u201d effectively ignoring the defining concern of the Obama-era Republican Party.",

      "subtitle": "A Closer Look at Hillary Clinton\u2019s Emails on BenghaziA review of some of the documents adds new dimension to the events surrounding the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya.By Michael S. Schmidt",
      "author": "Michael S. Schmidt",
      "content": " Hillary Rodham Clinton last year provided the State Department with 55,000 pages of emails that she said were related to her work as secretary of state, all from the personal account she exclusively used while leading the department. Roughly 850 pages of those emails that relate to Libya and the 2012 attacks on the United States outposts in Benghazi were handed over to a special committee appointed to investigate the attacks. In response to a request from Mrs. Clinton, the State Department plans to release those emails in the coming days. The New York Times obtained more than a third of those documents and has provided a guide to some of the key findings related to the Benghazi attacks below. From 2011 to 2012, Sidney Blumenthal, a longtime friend and confidant who was a senior adviser to Mrs. Clinton during her 2008 presidential campaign, sent her at least 25 memos about Libya, including several about the Benghazi attacks. Mrs. Clinton forwarded most of them to Jake Sullivan, her trusted foreign policy adviser. Mr. Sullivan would then send the memos along to other senior State Department officials, asking for their feedback. There is no evidence those officials were told that the memos were from Mr. Blumenthal. In April 2012, J. Christopher Stevens, the ambassador who died in the Benghazi attacks, was asked by Mr. Sullivan to provide his thoughts on the latest information \u201cfrom HRC friend.\u201d (Pages 127-128) Brian Fallon, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, said that Mr. Blumenthal had not been working for the government in any official capacity at the time and that his emails to Mrs. Clinton had not been solicited. The day after the Sept. 11, 2012, attacks on American outposts in Benghazi that killed Mr. Stevens and three other Americans, Mr. Blumenthal sent Mrs. Clinton a memo with his intelligence about what had occurred. The memo said the attacks were by \u201cdemonstrators\u201d who \u201cwere inspired by what many devout Libyan viewed as a sacrilegious internet video on the prophet Mohammed originating in America.\u201d Mrs. Clinton forwarded the memo to Mr. Sullivan, saying \u201cMore info.\u201d (Pages 193-195) The next day, Mr. Blumenthal sent Mrs. Clinton a more thorough account of what had occurred. Citing \u201csensitive sources\u201d in Libya, the memo provided extensive detail about the episode, saying that the siege had been set off by members of Ansar al-Shariah, the Libyan terrorist group. Those militants had ties to Al Qaeda, had planned the attacks for a month and had used a nearby protest as cover for the siege, the memo said. \u201cWe should get this around asap\u201d Mrs. Clinton said in an email to Mr. Sullivan. \u201cWill do,\u201d he responded. That information contradicted the Obama administration\u2019s narrative at the time about what had spawned the attacks. Republicans have said the administration misled the country about the attacks because it did not want to undermine the notion that President Obama, who was up for re-election, was winning the war on terrorism. (Pages 200-203) In early October 2012, a month before Mr. Obama was re-elected, Mr. Blumenthal forwarded Mrs. Clinton an article on a left-leaning website. The article cautioned that the Republicans could exploit the attacks in a \u201cJimmy Carter Strategy\u201d and use them to paint Mr. Obama as weak on terrorism. Mrs. Clinton forwarded the email to Mr. Sullivan. \u201cBe sure Ben knows they need to be ready for this line of attack,\u201d Mrs. Clinton wrote. She did not say to which Ben she was referring, but one of Mr. Obama\u2019s senior national security advisers is Benjamin J. Rhodes, who handles communications and speechwriting. Mrs. Clinton then told Mr. Blumenthal that she was \u201cpushing to WH\u201d the story. \u201cAccording to Politico yesterday, there was an internal argument within the Romney campaign over Libya,\u201d Mr. Blumenthal said in response. \u201cObviously, the neocons and the Rove oriented faction (Ed Gillespie, Rove\u2019s surrogate is now a Romney campaign adviser) beat Stuart Stevens.\u201d (Pages 215-225) Mrs. Clinton\u2019s emails show that she had a special type of government information known as \u201csensitive but unclassified,\u201d or \u201cSBU,\u201d in her account. That information included the whereabouts and travel plans of American officials in Libya as security there deteriorated during the uprising against the leadership of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in 2011. Nearly a year and a half before the attacks in Benghazi, Mr. Stevens, then an American envoy to the rebels, considered leaving Benghazi citing deteriorating security, according to an email to Mrs. Clinton marked \u201cSBU.\u201d",

      "author": "Matt Flegenheimer",
      "content": " COLUMBUS, Ohio \u2014 Hillary Clinton disparaged the economic record and policy acumen of Donald J. Trump in a speech on Tuesday, suggesting his ideas were ill-considered and scrutinizing his own checkered business history. Some of the highlights: \u2022 Mrs. Clinton said the American economy \u201cisn\u2019t yet where we want it to be, but we are stronger and better positioned than anyone in the world.\u201d She trumpeted her fiscal record as a senator from New York. \u2022 She said that, like Mr. Trump\u2019s foreign policy ideas, his economic proposals were dangerous. \u201cJust like he shouldn\u2019t have his finger on the button, he shouldn\u2019t have his hands on our economy,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. \u2022 Mrs. Clinton cited a series of Mr. Trump\u2019s past controversial comments about issues like the minimum wage. She said Mr. Trump had also \u201csaid all kinds of things about women in the workforce. He once called pregnant employees \u2014 and I quote \u2014 \u2018an inconvenience.\u2019\u201d \u2022 Mrs. Clinton, who has often been criticized for her ties to Wall Street, suggested Mr. Trump would \u201ctake us back to where we were before the crisis\u201d and \u201crig the economy for Wall Street again.\u201d She also assailed Mr. Trump\u2019s comments appraising himself as the \u201cking of debt.\u201d \u2022 Predicting that Mr. Trump would cause a recession, Mrs. Clinton noted that the global economy \u201changs on every word our president says.\u201d She said Mr. Trump\u2019s suggesting that the United States might default on its debt could start \u201ca global panic\u201d if he were president. \u2022 Mrs. Clinton described the process of constructing her speech: \u201cI had my researchers and my speech writers send me information\u201d on Mr. Trump \u201cand then I\u2019d say, \u2018Really? He really said that?\u2019 And they\u2019d send me all the background and the video clip.\u201d \u2022 Observing that Mr. Trump had not released his tax returns, Mrs. Clinton speculated that he might be \u201cafraid\u201d of voters seeing what they would reveal. \u201cMaybe he isn\u2019t as rich as he claims,\u201d she said. \u2022 As Mr. Trump posted on Twitter to counter Mrs. Clinton\u2019s remarks, she ticked off a list of foreign countries where Trump-branded products had been made. \u2022 The crowd laughed when Mrs. Clinton discussed Mr. Trump\u2019s record with casinos in Atlantic City and the bankruptcies of his companies. She said Mr. Trump had \u201cwritten a lot of books about business\u201d and added, \u201cThey all seem to end at Chapter 11.\u201d \u2022 Mrs. Clinton raised the controversy surrounding Trump University, which has been sued for fraud. \u201cThis is his one move. He makes over-the-top promises,\u201d she said, \u201cthen everything falls apart and people get hurt.\u201d \u2022 Invoking her deceased father\u2019s small business, Mrs. Clinton said Mr. Trump had refused to pay contractors for work they had completed. \u201cSo I take this personally,\u201d she said. \u2022 Wrapping a 45-minute speech, Mrs. Clinton reiterated a campaign theme \u2014 \u201cStronger Together\u201d\u2014 and argued that Mr. Trump \u201cbelieves in the worst of us.\u201d As she spoke, the Trump campaign sent news releases to reporters raising questions about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s conduct and judgment.",

      "author": "Gwen Ifill",
      "content": " Moving to silence her critics, Hillary Rodham Clinton held a highly unusual news conference today in which she offered a calm and determined explanation of her financial dealings and an apology for the way the White House has handled questions about them. Seated casually in the State Dining Room at the White House under the portrait of a pensive Abraham Lincoln, Mrs. Clinton said she was setting aside her desire for a \"zone of privacy\" to set the record straight on commodities and real estate investments that she and Bill Clinton made while he was Attorney General and Governor of Arkansas. The White House has been besieged with questions about whether influential business people in Arkansas gave the Clintons favorable treatment on their personal investments and improperly funneled money into Mr. Clinton's 1984 gubernatorial campaign. Mrs. Clinton initially told aides that she had turned a $1,000 commodities investment into a $100,000 profit by studying the financial news and placing trades herself. Earlier this month, White House officials conceded that James B. Blair, a family friend and a lawyer for one of the state's largest companies, Tyson Foods Inc., had played an advisory role in placing the trades. Today, she said she had relied heavily on the advice of Mr. Blair. \"I did the trades,\" she said. \"They were my trades. I was responsible for them. But I did them on the advice of Jim Blair, and very often he placed them for me.\" [ Excerpts begin on page 11. ] Mrs. Clinton said she had honestly forgotten about a $6,000 profit she made on a commodities investment in 1980 and could not recall whether commodities earnings were used to offset losses on an investment in a failed real estate development. She also said that she did not remember being notified when her commodities trading account fell below its required minimum and that she did not believe that she had ever received preferential treatment. \"I'm not in any way excusing any confusion that we have created,\" she said. \"I think we have created it because I don't think that we gave enough time or focused enough.\" Mrs. Clinton maintained that the \"fundamental facts\" regarding her investment in the real estate venture, the Whitewater Development Corporation, and in commodities trading had not changed. She said her recent troubles had been caused by poor efforts to remember and an initial reluctance to reveal information she considered private. \"I do feel like I've always been a fairly private person leading a public life,\" she said. \"I've always believed in a zone of privacy. And I told a friend the other day that I feel, after resisting for a long time, I've been rezoned.\" During the 70-minute news conference, called after advisers and friends convinced her that she would be her own best defender, Mrs. Clinton acknowledged that she had at first opposed appointing a special prosecutor to investigate her ties to the Whitewater development. But she said she has suffered through a learning experience in Washington. \"This is not a long-term problem or issue in any way,\" she said. \"But I don't want anybody to have the wrong impressions of either of us.\" Decline in Popularity Mrs. Clinton's popularity has slid in the weeks since the White House began issuing partial and sometimes conflicting explanations about her financial activities. A Los Angeles Times poll conducted on April 16-19 found that only 44 percent of the public viewed her favorably, as opposed to the 56 percent who did in January. White House officials said today that what Mrs. Clinton called an evolutionary process began a few weeks ago, but that the decision to respond to requests for a news conference was not made until early today. On the Whitewater matter, Mrs. Clinton said she could not explain why her partners, James and Susan McDougal, had lost more money on the 50-50 investment than she and her husband had; she said she and her husband had simply made payments on the development as the McDougals requested them. She resisted the notion that she and her husband, who are both lawyers, should have been less passive and more involved in their investments. Trusted Friend's Advice On the commodities trading, Mrs. Clinton said she had trusted Mr. Blair's advice because he was an old friend who knew more about the cattle market than she did. As Governor, she said, Mr. Clinton performed the wedding ceremony when Jim and Diane Blair married. \"Mr. Blair, who ended up losing money, I think would find it very hard to argue that he got any favorable treatment\" from the state, Mrs. Clinton said. \"I just don't think there's any evidence of that. \"I tried to educate myself because I took the responsibility seriously.\" Mrs. Clinton said she had read the stock tables with her daughter, Chelsea, in the same way that her father read them with her, but she added that she relied on Mr. Blair's advice \"because he really spent an enormous amount of time studying the market and talking to many more people than I ever could have, people who, you know, ran feed lots or bought beef for large supermarket chains.\" Mrs. Clinton said that she was lucky to drop out of the commodities market before she lost money and that Mr. Blair had actually lost money. Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, the New York Republican who has been a persistent critic of the Clintons on Whitewater, said Mrs. Clinton did not answer all the questions on the matter. \"She did not adequately explain how it is that a 50-50 partnership did not require all of the partners to put up sufficient funds,\" he said. Her performance today, as she sat next to an untouched glass of water and kept talking until the questions turned to health care -- her preferred topic -- pleased her supporters. It was carried live on all four television networks, while her husband's earlier news conference just down the hall, where he fielded questions about imminent military action in Bosnia, was carried live only by Cable News Network. Pleased With Performance Mrs. Clinton's supporters in and out of the White House said they were delighted with the news conference. Lynn Cutler, a leader of a committee formed to defend Mrs. Clinton against questions about her integrity, said she was was \"ecstatic\" about the outcome. \"I thought she was terrific,\" Ms. Cutler said. \"She was everything that I knew she could be. She was relaxed. She was frank and open. When she couldn't recall, she said she could not recall. She never dissembled, not once. \"It was just pure Hillary.\" White House officials who spoke only on condition of anonymity, expressed similar relief and pleasure. Aides said today that Mrs. Clinton had prepared for her appearance by consulting with both her private lawyer, David Kendall, and with Mandy Grunwald, the political consultant who acts as a media adviser for the White House. In the course of the question-and-answer session, she invoked the influence of her parents, her commitment to her family and her desire to get Whitewater questions out of the way so that she can focus on issues like health care. No Corporate Raider Mrs. Clinton said she was always a relatively small investor who trusted the advice of friends to take big risks and could never have been mistaken for a 1980's corporate raider. \"I think it's a pretty long stretch to say that the decisions that we made to try to create some financial security for our family and make some investments come anywhere near there,\" Mrs. Clinton said. \"I don't think you'll ever find anything that my husband or I said that in any way condemns the importance of making good investments and saving or that in any way undermines what is the heart and soul of the American economy, which is risk-taking and investing in the future.\"",

      "content": " In the first showdown between Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump, the presidential candidates exchanged blows on trade and foreign policy, called each other racist and inept, and could not resist letting out stray smirks or occasional sniffles. Commentators across the web on Monday night tended to conclude that their favored candidate had come out on top. But on balance, Mrs. Clinton was seen as having had the better night, based on the contrast between her steady grasp of policy and Mr. Trump\u2019s tendency to ramble and occasionally raise his voice. Here is a sample of reaction on social media and elsewhere online: \u201cClinton was in command from beginning, succeeded where Trump\u2019s GOP opponents failed: remain unflappable and in control of arguments. No knockout blow but Clinton won this debate hands down. Trump struggled with format, duration, and facts and rambled.\u201d Kim Ghattas, BBC correspondent _____ \u201cGreat that debate covered Trump\u2019s taxes, income, father, \u201972 lawsuit, remarks as a reality TV star and didn\u2019t waste any time on immigration.\u201d Ann Coulter, conservative author and commentator _____ \u201cHillary Clinton has had the best debate training I\u2019ve seen in years. She knows when to attack and when to explain.\u201d Frank Luntz, Republican pollster _____ \u201cTrump was completely out of his league, reduced at times to going on and on, repeating his same talking points with little in the way of demonstrated knowledge or detail. He missed several opportunities to pin Clinton down on issues she has prevaricated about because he became flustered and lost his focus, forgot why he was there.\u201d Ruth Sherman, public speaking expert _____ \u201cBottom line: Trump was doing pretty well for the first fifteen minutes, then Hillary went on the offensive, and Trump choked.\u201d William Kristol, editor of the conservative magazine The Weekly Standard _____ \u201cFirst half: Donald Trump. Second half: Hillary Clinton. OT: Donald Trump. I think he gets a bump UNLESS birther issue drowns out all.\u201d Hugh Hewitt, conservative radio host _____ \u201cGood news for Democrats: Really hard to see how that debate helped Trump. Bad news: If it somehow did help Trump, maybe no stopping him?\u201d Nate Silver, editor of FiveThirtyEight _____ \u201cHillary won this debate, hands-down.\u201d DeRay Mckesson, Black Lives Matter activist _____ \u201cThe energy that Donald Trump offered tonight is why the enthusiasm is on our side.

Inside the cramped auditorium of Douglas G. Grafflin Elementary School, neighbors and supporters swarmed around Mrs. Clinton and former President Bill Clinton to catch a glimpse. Fathers hoisted their daughters on their shoulders and mothers held babies in the air to get a photo of Mrs. Clinton, bent down to fill out her ballot. \u201cIt\u2019s a humbling feeling,\u201d Mrs. Clinton told reporters as she shook hands with supporters gathered outside the polling location. \u201cI know how much responsibility goes with this,\u201d she added, \u201cso many people are counting on the outcome of this election and what it means for our country.\u201d Asked if she thought of her mother, Dorothy Rodham, who was born on the day Congress approved women\u2019s right to vote, and whose impoverished childhood formed the backbone of her daughter\u2019s campaign, Mrs. Clinton replied, \u201cOh, I did.\u201d After voting Mrs. Clinton went back to her house, about a five-minute drive from the school, and did a string of interviews to encourage people to vote. \u201cI was glad to see there were lots of people out to vote,\u201d she told a Detroit radio station. Later on Tuesday, Mrs. Clinton and her top aides planned to decamp to a Midtown hotel to fine-tune the two versions of the speech she planned to deliver at the Javits Center, and to watch the results come in to see which version of that speech she would end up giving.",

The book comes as Mrs. Clinton contemplates another run for the presidency. Independent political action groups have sprung up to support her, while critics have mobilized to stop her potential candidacy. Both sides will most likely scour the contents of the book to advance their narratives about her time as the nation\u2019s top diplomat. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s 2003 book, \u201cLiving History,\u201d sold more than one million copies, but foreign diplomacy may be harder to sell than East Wing intrigue. Given Mrs. Clinton\u2019s current status as the presumptive Democratic front-runner, however, the book will lead to a news media blitz and book tour that could lay the groundwork for her campaign. Simon & Schuster, the publishing house, has not yet said what the book will be called, but said Mrs. Clinton would provide readers with \u201ccandid reflections about key moments\u201d at the State Department as well as her reflections on navigating diplomacy in the 21st century, The Associated Press first reported.",

      "subtitle": "Whitewater Panel Focuses on Mrs. ClintonBy Stephen LabatonPRINT EDITIONAugust 4, 1995, Page A00022",
      "author": "Stephen Labaton",
      "content": " The Senate Whitewater panel today bore down on White House officials in search of new clues about Hillary Rodham Clinton's role in the handling of files in Vincent W. Foster Jr.'s office after his suicide two years ago. Under Republican questioning, a White House lawyer testified that the White House counsel, Bernard W. Nussbaum, told him that Mrs. Clinton had expressed concern about \"unfettered access\" to Mr. Foster's office by investigators. The lawyer, Stephen R. Neuwirth, said Mr. Nussbaum said he had heard of that concern from Susan Thomases, one of Mrs. Clinton's closest confidantes. Mr. Foster was a longtime friend of the Clintons who came with them to Washington to become the deputy White House counsel. He handled many of their most sensitive political and personal legal matters, including their blind trust, their taxes and the sale of their interest in the Whitewater land venture. His body, with a bullet wound to the head, was found in a park in suburban Virginia on July 20, 1993. Two days later, Mr. Nussbaum led a search through Mr. Foster's papers, as angry Justice Department investigators sat in the office, not allowed to see the material without Mr. Nussbaum's permission. During the search, Mr. Nussbaum overlooked the remnants of a note, discovered four days later, in which Mr. Foster wrote of his unhappiness about life in Washington. A few hours after the search, some of Mr. Foster's files were removed and sent to the Clintons' personal quarters in the White House, where Clinton Administration officials say they sat for five days undisturbed before being shipped to the Clintons' personal lawyers at the firm Williams & Connolly. Justice Department officials have testified that Mr. Nussbaum reneged on an agreement to let prosecutors look at the cover pages of files in Mr. Foster's office at the July 22 review. Mr. Nussbaum has said that he never made such an agreement and that he decided to prevent department lawyers from looking at the files on the ground of executive privilege and attorney-client privilege. Mr. Nussbaum has told Congressional investigators that he did have a talk with Ms. Thomases about the review of the papers in Mr. Foster's office in which she said there was concern about giving prosecutors uncontrolled access. He has also said he has no recollection that Ms. Thomases ever mentioned Mrs. Clinton in that conversation. Republicans on the Whitewater committee have been trying to make the case that Mr. Nussbaum impeded the investigation after Mrs. Clinton spoke to Ms. Thomases about her worries. Panel members tried today to draw out other evidence of Mrs. Clinton's interest in the Foster files. In testimony today, a clerk in the White House counsel's office, Thomas Castleton, contradicted the account of the files' transfer that had been provided by Mrs. Clinton's chief of staff, Margaret A. Williams. Miss Williams testified last week that it was her idea to move the files to the Clintons' quarters and that Mrs. Clinton had no intention of reviewing them and never did. But Mr. Castleton said Miss Williams gave him a different account as he helped her move a box or two of the files from the West Wing offices of the White House to the Clintons' quarters on the third floor. \"My understanding,\" Mr. Castleton said, \"was that they contained documents of a personal and financial nature that pertained to the First Family and that they needed to be reviewed, because there was an unfamiliarity with what exactly was in those files. \"My understanding, from the conversation I had with Miss Williams, was that the First Lady would be reviewing them.\" Another White House aide, Carolyn Huber, also told the panel today that Miss Williams had told her that Mrs. Clinton requested that the files be put in the family's quarters. Ms. Huber said she received a call from Miss Williams on July 22 to arrange for the files to be stored in there. Mr. Nussbaum, in his deposition to Congressional lawyers, also said he assumed that the files were going to the Clintons' quarters. Democrats quickly retorted today that there was nothing improper with Mrs. Clinton examining her financial and personal records that had been in Mr. Foster's office. The Administration has previously said there was nothing unusual about storing the documents in the family quarters rather than have them picked up immediately by the Clintons' personal lawyers. But the White House has also insisted that Mrs. Clinton never looked at the files. Despite the contradictions offered today, the committee's chairman, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, said he had not changed his mind about not calling Mrs. Clinton as a witness. Mr. D'Amato has said he will not ask her to testify unless there is strong evidence that directly ties her to the mishandling of the papers in Mr. Foster's office. During a break in the proceedings today, the Senator said that it was \"premature\" to consider whether Mrs. Clinton's testimony was necessary and that he had to await the testimony of other officials and White House advisers, notably Mr. Nussbaum and Ms. Thomases, who are expected to appear before the committee as early as next week. \"The testimony today is certainly important,\" Mr. D'Amato said, \"but it is not nearly sufficient to bring about a change in my thinking.\" The hearings briefly degenerated into bickering between the Republicans and the Democrats over the use of Mr. Foster's briefcase as stage prop for lawmakers and others. During one break, a Republican aide handed the briefcase to a television reporter who promptly flourished it before his camera with a few scraps of paper to try to re-enact what the note might have looked like. Earlier in the day, Republicans on the committee managed to get a reluctant Mr. Neuwirth to do the same thing. In plain view of scurrying news photographers, he re-created how he had stumbled onto the note in the briefcase on July 26, six days after Mr. Foster's death. Mr. Neuwirth said he was putting several personal items from Mr. Foster's office into a box to be sent to his family and had just placed two photographs of Mr. Foster, a daughter and President Clinton in a box when he came upon the briefcase. \"I bent over to put it into the box,\" he said, \"and either to the left or to the right turned it so that I could fit it into the box without damaging the pictures. I don't know the exact angle at which I turned it, but I turned it enough for scraps of paper to fall out as I was putting it into the box.\" Mr. Neuwirth said that he noticed that the scraps had Mr. Foster's handwriting and that he took them into Mr. Nussbaum's office, where he put them on a conference table. He said that he then summoned Mr. Nussbaum, and that the two of them pieced the scraps together like a jigsaw puzzle. A short time later, he said, Mr. Nussbaum led Mrs. Clinton into the office to see Mr. Foster's ruminations about how in Washington, \"ruining people is considered sport.\"",

      "subtitle": "Hillary Clinton Announces 2016 Presidential BidThe announcement ends two years of speculation and immediately establishes Mrs. Clinton as the likely Democratic nominee.By Amy Chozick",
      "author": "Amy Chozick",
      "content": " Ending two years of speculation and coy denials, Hillary Rodham Clinton announced on Sunday that she would seek the presidency for a second time, immediately establishing herself as the likely 2016 Democratic nominee. \u201cI\u2019m running for president,\u201d she said with a smile near the end of a two-minute video released just after 3 p.m. \u201cEveryday Americans need a champion. And I want to be that champion,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. \u201cSo I\u2019m hitting the road to earn your vote \u2014 because it\u2019s your time. And I hope you\u2019ll join me on this journey.\u201d The announcement came minutes after emails from John D. Podesta, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, alerting donors and longtime Clinton associates to her candidacy. Mr. Podesta said that Mrs. Clinton would meet soon with voters in Iowa and host a formal kickoff event some time next month. The announcement effectively began what could be one of the least contested races, without an incumbent, for the Democratic presidential nomination in recent history \u2014 a stark contrast to the 2008 primaries, when Mrs. Clinton, the early front-runner, ended up in a long and expensive battle won by Barack Obama. It could also be the first time a woman captures a major party\u2019s nomination. Regardless of the outcome, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign will open a new chapter in the extraordinary life of a public figure who has captivated and polarized the country since her husband, former President Bill Clinton, declared his intention to run for president in 1991. Mrs. Clinton was the co-star of the Clinton administration, the only first lady ever elected to the United States Senate and a globe-trotting diplomat who surprised her party by serving dutifully under the president who defeated her. She will embark on her latest \u2014 and perhaps last \u2014 bid for the White House with nearly universal name recognition and a strong base of support, particularly among women. But in a campaign that will inevitably be about the future, Mrs. Clinton, 67, enters as a quintessential baby boomer, associated with the 1990s and with the drama of the Bill Clinton years. This campaign will begin on a small scale and build up to an effort likely to cost more than any presidential bid waged before, with Mrs. Clinton\u2019s supporters and outside \u201csuper PACs\u201d looking to raise as much as $2.5 billion in a blitz of donations from Democrats who overwhelmingly support her candidacy. Much of that enthusiasm is tied to the chance to make history by electing a woman to the presidency. But some, too, owes to the lack of compelling alternatives in a party trying desperately to hold on to the White House when Republicans control the House and the Senate. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s declaration on Sunday is to be followed by a series of intimate but critical campaign events in Iowa and New Hampshire. She will use them to reintroduce herself to voters and begin to lay out the central theme of her candidacy: improving the economic fortunes of the middle class, with an emphasis on increasing wages and reducing income inequality. In the video, she does not appear until after 90 seconds of images featuring personal stories of others, each describing how they are getting ready to start something new. The video prominently features a black couple expecting a child, a young Asian-American woman, and two men who say they are getting married. It also shows plenty of the white, working-class people who were crucial to her previous White House bid and signals that she intends to make helping the middle class and reducing income inequality major themes of her campaign. Near the end of the video, Mrs. Clinton finally appears outside a suburban home and says: \u201cI\u2019m getting ready to do something too. I\u2019m running for president.\u201d Her return to the campaign trail this week offers her a fortuitous circumstance: Tuesday is National Equal Pay Day, the point in the year at which, on average, a woman\u2019s pay for working in 2014 and 2015 would equal a man\u2019s pay just for 2014. Pay equity is an issue that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s candidacy will take up in earnest, along with others important to many women, like paid family and medical leave, a higher minimum wage and affordable access to child care. Unlike in her 2008 campaign, when she played down gender and sought to show she was tough enough to be president, Mrs. Clinton plans to highlight that she is a grandmother and trumpet her chance to make history. \u201cBeing the first woman to run for president with a real chance of winning, that\u2019s a wild card, but potentially a net positive, particularly for undecided women,\u201d said Scott Keeter, director of survey research at the Pew Research Center. It was not surprising that Mrs. Clinton chose to make her intentions public in a video circulated on social media. Since she left the State Department in early 2013, she has found a welcome outlet in Twitter, which has allowed her to express her opinions in terse missives while avoiding the news conferences that are likely to become a mainstay now that she is a presidential candidate. She will also look for ways to demonstrate that, after more than three decades in public life, she understands the ways of modern campaigns and can appeal to younger voters. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s 35-year-old campaign manager, Robby Mook, known for exploiting technology, data and analytics to win elections, has already dispatched field organizers to Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. For all the months of quiet and careful planning, however, her campaign\u2019s rollout did not come off as smoothly as envisioned. Rather than gliding into the spotlight as an above-the-fray former secretary of state, Mrs. Clinton entered the 2016 race in the midst of lingering questions about her exclusive use of a private email address while at the State Department and about donations from foreign countries to her family\u2019s philanthropic foundation. Mr. Podesta, the campaign chairman, assured donors that both controversies would pass and that the momentum would shift as soon as Mrs. Clinton was officially a candidate, according to a person involved in those discussions. Mrs. Clinton will enter the race with a strong base of support: 81 percent of Democrats said they would consider voting for her, according to a CBS News poll conducted in February. That support dwarfs that of her potential rivals for the nomination, including former Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley of Maryland, former Senator Jim Webb of Virginia and Senator Bernard Sanders, an independent from Vermont who could run as a Democrat. But the roller coaster of a presidential campaign can erode even the most seemingly certain advantages. Just over eight years ago, Mrs. Clinton began that campaign with an email to supporters declaring that she was \u201cin to win.\u201d That announcement began a downward trajectory in which she went from being considered the inevitable nominee to finishing in third place in the Iowa caucuses, behind Mr. Obama and John Edwards. She went on to pick up primary victories in crucial battleground states like Ohio and Pennsylvania, but by then Mr. Obama had an edge in the fight for delegates. In her 2008 concession speech, Mrs. Clinton sought to energize the women who had supported her candidacy. \u201cAlthough we weren\u2019t able to shatter that highest, hardest glass ceiling this time, thanks to you, it\u2019s got about 18 million cracks in it,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the light is shining through like never before, filling us all with the hope and the sure knowledge that the path will be a little easier next time.\u201d This time, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s aides have signaled that she will take nothing for granted and present herself as a more humble candidate, as unencumbered by the trappings of power and celebrity as is possible for a universally recognized former first lady, secretary of state and presidential candidate. There may be little room for error, though, for Mrs. Clinton, who will begin her campaign under the glare of intense media scrutiny and criticism from a broad field of potential Republican opponents, including former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, and Senators Ted Cruz of Texas, Marco Rubio of Florida and Rand Paul of Kentucky \u2014 all of whom will try to prove they are best positioned to defeat her.",

      "author": "Amy Chozick",
      "content": " Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign would like to turn the drip-drip-drip of Republican defectors abandoning Donald J. Trump into a deluge. On Wednesday, after days in which several high-profile Republicans said they could not support Mr. Trump or were endorsing Mrs. Clinton, her campaign introduced an official outreach effort to target Republicans, along with a list of nearly 50 Republican and independent former cabinet secretaries, House and Senate members, ambassadors, national security leaders and business executives who are supporting Mrs. Clinton. The group, called Together for America, includes the prominent George W. Bush administration official Carlos M. Gutierrez, a businessman and former secretary of commerce; former Representative Connie Morella, of Maryland; and John D. Negroponte, the former director of national intelligence in the Bush administration. The list also includes previously announced supporters, including Meg Whitman, the California Republican fund-raiser and technology executive. \u201cAs a proud Republican, casting my vote for president has usually been a simple matter. Not this year,\u201d Ms. Whitman, the chief executive of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, said in a statement. \u201cTogether for America,\u201d the campaign said, \u201cwill work to build the coalition of Republican and independents who are supporting Clinton and help amplify their voices to Republican and independent voters.\u201d The announcement of the group comes a day after Senator Susan Collins of Maine said she could not support Mr. Trump and seems a remarkable turn of events, after Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign had tried for many months in the Democratic primary to win over the liberal wing of the party. But Ms. Collins, like many Republicans who dislike Mr. Trump, also don\u2019t support Mrs. Clinton. The Together for America effort seemed to use the Republican supporters to send the implicit message to others who may be sheepish about supporting a Democratic candidate who has for so long been at odds with Republicans. The Clinton campaign\u2019s chairman, John D. Podesta, wants to persuade reluctant Republicans to not only reject Mr. Trump, but also to support Mrs. Clinton, because of her \u201cexperience and temperament make her a steady leader for this unique moment,\u201d he said in a statement. Mrs. Clinton herself made an appeal Wednesday to voters in Utah, a state that has consistently voted Republican in recent decades. In an editorial in The Deseret News, Mrs. Clinton courted Mormon voters who have been resistant to Mr. Trump. Mrs. Clinton wrote that she has been \u201cfighting to defend religious freedom for years.\u201d",

      "content": " Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign for president has been savvy about talking to young voters in the parlance of the social web, using emojis, sleek graphics and other formats. But the list \u201c7 things Hillary Clinton has in common with your abuela\u201d seemed to backfire this week. After Mrs. Clinton shared news of her daughter\u2019s second pregnancy, a \u201ccontent strategist\u201d for her campaign posted the list, an effort to appeal to young Hispanic voters by pointing out how she was just like their abuelas, or grandmothers: She cares for all children. She reads to her grandchild before bedtime. She doesn\u2019t tolerate disrespect. Her critics were not impressed. Soon, the hashtag #NotMyAbuela was circulating as a critique of what some saw as a tone-deaf move to pander to a powerful but marginalized bloc of voters. Her critics pointed out that Mrs. Clinton did not grow up poor like their relatives, and was not separated from loved ones by country borders. Others just made their points with the magic of memes. Mrs. Clinton is not the only politician who has attempted playful acknowledgment of Latino culture: Jeb Bush, a Republican contender whose wife is Mexican-American, sold a \u201cguaca bowle\u201d on his website, and supporters of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s main challenger, Bernie Sanders, have long referred to him as #TioBernie on Twitter. (On Wednesday, Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign took steps to distance him from the hashtag.) In Mrs. Clinton\u2019s case, the Internet soon gave new currency to the word \u201cHispandering.\u201d In an email on Wednesday, Lorella Praeli, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s director of Latino outreach, responded to the critics. \u201cAs a Latina who recently became a citizen, I know firsthand the challenges that many in this country face,\u201d Ms. Praeli wrote, \u201cincluding fear of deportation, and Hillary is committed to fighting against Republican attacks to tear families like mine apart.\u201d Mrs. Clinton\u2019s occasional online gaffes tend to attract more attention than the day-to-day operations of her campaign on social media. In June, she ramped up her efforts to appeal to the digital crowd by hiring an editor from Buzzfeed, the website known for perfecting the captivating art of the Internet list, to run her social media presence. Her social media output has expanded to include question-and-answer sessions, blog posts written by content strategists, a plethora of hashtags and colorful variations of her campaign logos. Even so, her staff has made some awkward attempts at good memes, and critics generally respond by showcasing their own fluency in the language of the Internet. In August, Mrs. Clinton asked her followers on Twitter to use up to three emojis to tell the tale of their student debt. (Her team\u2019s grammar was also criticized.) In December, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign designed a logo meant to honor the day Rosa Parks refused to give up her bus seat to a white man in Montgomery, Ala., in 1955, but the logo appeared to place the civil rights hero at the back of the bus.",

      "author": "Patricia Leigh Brown",
      "content": " The heroic bronze figures on the Francis Scott Key Monument are corroded, and an oar that was once in the statue's supple-looking stone waters is long gone. But standing in front of this beleaguered 1911 monument to the national anthem in a quiet, green square this afternoon, Hillary Rodham Clinton spoke of renewal. Her visit kicked off ''Save America's Treasures,'' Mrs. Clinton's four-day history tour and preservation pledge drive that ends on Thursday in Seneca Falls, N.Y., at a celebration of the 150th anniversary of the first American women's rights convention. In many ways, the tour reflects the current diversity of the historic preservation movement, once associated with battlefields, Presidents' birthplaces and blue-haired lady restorers in sneakers. Although Mrs. Clinton is in fact visiting one site where George Washington really slept -- his headquarters in Newburgh, N.Y. -- her stops also include a dilapidated theater, an Indian archaeological site, Thomas Alva Edison's laboratory and landmarks devoted to women's rights and African-American history. The tour, a traditional First Lady-like endeavor, is designed to raise public awareness that if history is America's future, the bridge to the 21st century is in precarious shape. Earlier today, the President appeared with his wife at the National Museum of American History in Washington. They were dwarfed by the original ''Star-Spangled Banner.'' The 15-stripe, 15-star flag, which looms nearly three stories high, survived the attack on Fort McHenry in 1813-14 and inspired Francis Scott Key but is now a fragile, muted textile in dire need of restoration. The President and First Lady shared the stage with Ralph Lauren, the designer who launched thousands of Polo sweaters with the American flag on them. Mrs. Clinton's campaign began with the announcement that Mr. Lauren had agreed to contribute $10 million toward the flag's conservation, including a state-of-the art laboratory that will be visible to museum-goers. ''We've been assured that this is a philanthropic gift and not a marketing gift,'' said I. Michael Heyman, secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. The sites on Mrs. Clinton's tour include Federal, state and privately financed landmarks, all with expensive wish lists. One of the not-so-subtle purposes of the tour is to encourage public-private partnerships like Mr. Lauren's donation, the single largest corporate contribution in the Smithsonian's history. The Park Service alone has a $1 billion backlog in historic structure repair, said Randall J. Biallas, the chief historical architect. The President's budget request of $50 million for the preservation program has yet to be approved by Congress. ''We are not talking about just generous gifts, but also encouraging kindergartners to collect pennies to clean up the monument in the town square,'' Mrs. Clinton said in an interview at the White House. Speaking later at the National Museum of American History, she encouraged Americans to be ''good ancestors,'' preserving landmark buildings as well as artifacts like ''historic photographs yellowing in a county clerk's cabinet.'' An example is the contents of the Thomas Alva Edison National Historic Site in West Orange, N.J. It was there, in his Invention Laboratory, that the master inventor developed, among other things, the motion picture camera, the nickel-iron-alkaline battery and the disk photograph. Now a little-known outpost of the National Park Service, the site consists not only of historic structures, including the first building designed for motion-picture filming, but also 400,000 artifacts and 5 million pieces of paper, including original letters and lab notes, many of which are decomposing. Mrs. Clinton is the latest of several First Ladies to adopt American history and the environment as their cause: Lady Bird Johnson campaigned for the beautification of the nation's highways, and Jacqueline Kennedy took on the renovation and preservation of the White House. In her new endeavor, Mrs. Clinton has surrounded herself with preservation gurus, most notably Richard Moe, president of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, which is sponsoring the ''Save America's Treasures'' program with the White House Millennium Council. ''She's really into it,'' Mr. Moe said. ''We've never had a First Lady this deeply involved.'' Mrs. Clinton acknowledged that historic preservation is an easier cause than, say, health care. ''The politics are less controversial,'' she said. ''No one is going to stand up against 'The Star-Spangled Banner' and its need for preservation.'' In embracing preservation, Mrs. Clinton is attaching her star to a populist design movement that has sprung from the ground up from its inception, often against the wishes of politicians. In 1859, for example, Anne Pamela Cunningham established the Mount Vernon Ladies Association as a last resort after failing to persuade either Congress or the State of Virginia to save the mansion from developers. ''Historic preservation is the most important singular popular mass movement to affect architecture and planning in the modern era,'' said Vincent Scully, the Sterling Professor Emeritus of art history at Yale University, who recently gave an architectural lecture at the White House that reportedly had the Clintons spellbound. Mr. Scully continued: ''Architects hate it. It's the people taking back the way they want to live and what they want their cities to be, instead of being at the mercy of architects, planners and politicians.'' Among the people Mrs. Clinton will encounter is Stephen Miller in Pittsfield, Mass., whose art supply and wallpaper store is housed in the 1903 Colonial Theater, imbuing the neo-Baroque haunt of Douglas Fairbanks, Ethel and John Barrymore and Sarah Bernhardt with the scent of linseed oil and vinyl. This week the marquee reads, Miller Supply Co. Inc. Welcomes Hillary Rodham Clinton. Mr. Miller's father, George, bought the place in 1952, dreaming that one day he would restore it as a theater, drawing on both the local community and the Berkshire-bound culture tourists. The Colonial Theater has been waiting in the wings, mothballed and hidden, ever since, its now abandoned rotund balconies resplendent with dusty, peeling putty. Like the theater, Pittsfield has had its economic hardships. Robert Boland, the head of the Friends of the Colonial Theater, a private group, said that about $10 million was needed to restore the building. The state has committed $2.5 million, he said. There is no Ralph Lauren in Pittsfield, and the unglamorous nitty-gritty work of preserving landmarks falls to people like Mr. Miller. ''We'd love to see it renovated; that has always been the intent,'' Mr. Miller said recently, leading a visitor up a hidden staircase to the theater, its silk and linen damask curtains still sweeping the balcony but no longer Nile green. ''There's plenty of sweat maintaining a building like this. My hope is that Hillary Clinton's presence will serve as a catalyst to get this off the ground.''",

Seelye and Amy ChozickPRINT EDITIONOctober 25, 2014, Page A13",
      "author": "Katharine Q. Seelye",
      "content": "  BOSTON \u2014 The two most prominent women in the Democratic Party, whom liberals have cast as potential future rivals, stood backstage and swapped stories about being grandmothers. But Hillary Rodham Clinton and Senator Elizabeth Warren, here Friday to rally voters for Martha Coakley, the Democratic nominee for governor of Massachusetts, never appeared on stage together. In fact, relations between the two have been frosty since Ms. Warren began criticizing Mrs. Clinton for being too cozy with Wall Street. Bill Clinton, who campaigned for other Democrats in 2012, declined to appear for Ms. Warren during her Senate race (Mrs. Clinton, as secretary of state, did not engage in political activity). But Mrs. Clinton, who is presumed to be the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, has been looking over her shoulder for the past several months and seen a groundswell of support develop on the left for a Warren candidacy \u2014 partly out of frustration that Mrs. Clinton appears too centrist. And so on Friday, Mrs. Clinton officially broke the ice, embracing Ms. Warren verbally, if not physically, and hailing her for the populist approach that Mrs. Clinton is said to lack. \u201cI am so pleased to be here with your senior senator, the passionate champion for working people and middle-class families, Elizabeth Warren!\u201d Mrs. Clinton said upon taking the stage after being introduced by Ms. Coakley. \u201cI love watching Elizabeth give it to those who deserve to get it,\u201d Mrs. Clinton added, speaking slowly and deliberately. \u201cStanding up not only for you but people with the same needs and the same wants across our country.\u201d In her 25-minute speech, Mrs. Clinton went on to adopt some of Ms. Warren\u2019s populist phrases and ideas, if not her tone. She praised Ms. Coakley for holding \u201cfinancial institutions accountable for the damage they have done to our economy and to individual lives.\u201d She spoke of women and families scraping by on the minimum wage, trying to make it into the middle class and stay in the middle class. \u201cDon\u2019t let anybody tell you that, you know, it\u2019s corporations and businesses that create jobs,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said, a variation on a popular Warren theme. Tim Miller, executive director of America Rising, a conservative \u201csuper PAC,\u201d called Mrs. Clinton\u2019s remark \u201ca ham-handed attempt to pander to liberal voters\u201d that showed \u201cjust how little she knows about job creation.\u201d Mrs. Clinton has been striking similar notes on recent campaign forays around the country, but this was on Ms. Warren\u2019s turf, with her listening in the wings. For her part, Ms. Warren did not have a lot to say about Mrs. Clinton, only that she was \u201chappy\u201d to welcome her back to Massachusetts. But she heaped praise on Ms. Coakley, with classic Warren observations like: \u201cOver and over, she stood up to the big national banks that tried to trick and trap and cheat our families here in Massachusetts.\u201d Despite being in the same line of work,  Mrs. Clinton and Ms. Warren have never formally made an appearance together, at least in recent years. They last overlapped in public, aides said, in early 2013, at the confirmation hearings for John Kerry, the former Massachusetts senator, to succeed Mrs. Clinton as secretary of state. There has been no love lost between the two since the publication of Ms. Warren\u2019s 2004 book, \u201cThe Two-Income Trap: Why Middle-Class Parents Are Going Broke,\u201d written with her daughter, Amelia Warren Tyagi. Ms. Warren writes about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s close ties to Wall Street as a senator from New York and her support for bankruptcy legislation that Ms. Warren opposed. \u201cAs New York\u2019s newest senator, however, it seems that Hillary Clinton could not afford such a principled position,\u201d Ms. Warren writes. \u201cCampaigns cost money, and that money wasn\u2019t coming from families in financial trouble.\u201d Asked what he made of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s overtures here to Ms. Warren, Jeffrey Berry, a political scientist at Tufts University, offered this: \u201cHold your friends close, hold your enemies closer. Certainly, Elizabeth Warren is one of the few people in the Democratic Party she has to fear, and she wants to give every signal that she respects Warren and wants to communicate that Warren will have her ear if she reaches the White House.\u201d Ms. Warren has said she has no interest in being president, but that has not doused the enthusiasm of progressives who want her to challenge Mrs. Clinton. Supporters at rallies are wearing \u201cReady For Warren\u201d T-shirts, a take on the Ready for Hillary super PAC that aims to drum up early support for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s likely candidacy. During the 2008 presidential Democratic primary race, Mrs. Clinton emphasized the economic prosperity of the 1990s, but that approach may not work in 2016. Ms. Warren\u2019s supporters blame some of Mr. Clinton\u2019s policies, namely legislation that allowed the commingling of commercial and investment banks, and trade pacts like the North American Free Trade Agreement, for contributing to widening income inequality. These same supporters have decried the Clintons\u2019 $200,000 fees for speeches, and excoriated Mrs. Clinton for saying that she and Mr. Clinton left the White House \u201cdead broke.\u201d Along with her newly populist message, Mrs. Clinton has been making her speeches more personal. She concluded here by noting that she, Ms. Warren and Gov. Deval Patrick had been chatting backstage, trading stories about their grandchildren. \u201cI only had a month\u2019s worth, but I was, you know, trying to keep up with their grandchildren getting ready for Halloween with costumes,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. \u201cBut as I was standing there and looking at the smile on Elizabeth\u2019s face as she was describing her grandchildren, and looking at the excitement on Deval\u2019s face as he was talking about his 16-month old,\u201d Mrs. Clinton recalled, \u201cI thought, when it all is said and done, that\u2019s what this is supposed to be about.\u201d",

      "author": "Thomas Kaplan",
      "content": "  LAS VEGAS \u2014 Unable to shake what has become a lingering distraction for her campaign, Hillary Clinton on Thursday played down a report from the State Department\u2019s inspector general that criticized her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. In an interview with ABC News, Mrs. Clinton repeated her concession that using the private email server was a mistake. But she suggested that voters had more important issues to consider when making up their minds between her and the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Donald J. Trump. \u201cAs I\u2019ve said many times, if I could go back, I would do it differently,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. \u201cI know people have concerns about this. I understand that. But I think voters are going to be looking at the full picture of what I have to offer, my life and my service, and the full threat that Donald Trump offers our country.\u201d The inspector general\u2019s report presented to Congress on Wednesday said that Mrs. Clinton had not sought or received permission to use the private email server. The report also said that, through her lawyers, Mrs. Clinton declined to be interviewed by the inspector general. The report gave new ammunition to Mr. Trump and threatened to bolster the perception already held by a majority of voters, according to polling, that Mrs. Clinton is not trustworthy. In the interview, Mrs. Clinton gave little ground over the email issue, asserting that the report \u201cmakes clear that personal email use was the practice for other secretaries of state.\u201d Asked if using private email was an error of judgment, she responded: \u201cWell, it was allowed. And the rules have been clarified since I left about the practice.\u201d She added, \u201cHaving said that, I have said many times, it was a mistake.\u201d Mrs. Clinton reiterated that argument in a phone interview with CNN on Thursday afternoon. \u201cI thought it was allowed,\u201d she told Wolf Blitzer. Asked why she declined to be interviewed for the review, Mrs. Clinton said, \u201cI\u2019d already said everything I could on this matter.\u201d In both interviews, she cited her 11-hour testimony to a House committee investigating the Sept. 11, 2012, attack on the United States mission in Benghazi, Libya, when extensive questions about her private email use came up. But unlike the Benghazi committee, an effort led by congressional Republicans, the State Department report was not partisan, a detail not lost on Mr. Trump. \u201cThis is not a Republican group or a conservative group,\u201d he said in an interview on Wednesday. \u201cThis is a group that is much more to her liking.\u201d Mr. Trump repeated his criticism of Mrs. Clinton at a news conference on Thursday, while Mrs. Clinton used her interviews to call her likely Republican rival \u201can unqualified loose cannon.\u201d \u201cPresident Obama came out of meetings with our closest allies in the world and reported that they are quote \u2018rattled\u2019 by the threat Donald Trump represents,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said on CNN. The interviews came as Mrs. Clinton spoke in Nevada on Thursday at a conference for the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, which endorsed her in January. Later in the afternoon, she returned to California to hold a pair of rallies ahead of the California primary on June 7. Though Mrs. Clinton previously led by double digits in numerous surveys, a poll released Wednesday showed her in a tight race with Senator Bernie Sanders. \u201cI really don\u2019t pay a lot of attention to polls because they are usually, and increasingly, all over the place,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said on CNN when asked about the tightening race in California. \u201cWe are already insurmountably ahead\u201d in the race for the 2,383 delegates needed to clinch the nomination, she added.",

      "author": "James Bennet",
      "content": " Hillary Rodham Clinton was questioned today at the White House for almost five hours about her legal work for a failed Arkansas savings and loan by Kenneth W. Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel, and other prosecutors from his office, Administration officials said. The session, the sixth time Mrs. Clinton has given sworn testimony about the Whitewater land deal, was videotaped to be shown to a Federal grand jury in Arkansas. That grand jury is scheduled to disband on May 7 after spending 30 months examining Whitewater and a thicket of related matters, including the failure of Madison Guaranty, a savings and loan owned by the Clintons' Whitewater partners. In a terse statement released this evening, Charles F. C. Ruff, the White House counsel, said of the interview: ''The subjects generally were matters concerning the Rose Law Firm's legal representation of Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan and Mrs. Clinton's relationship with related individuals.'' As a partner in the Rose firm, Mrs. Clinton performed work for Madison. In contrast to previous statements issued by the White House after Mrs. Clinton provided testimony to Mr. Starr, the statement today did not say she was ''cooperating fully'' with the investigation. But White House officials said the fact that Mrs. Clinton agreed to the meeting was evidence of the Clintons' cooperation. Today's questioning, in the Yellow Room of the White House, took place in an even more politically charged atmosphere than previous sessions. Since accusations surfaced that President Clinton had a sexual relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky, a former intern at the White House, and tried to cover it up, Mrs. Clinton has assailed Mr. Starr as a politically motivated prosecutor linked to right-wing enemies of the President. A separate Federal grand jury here is looking into the charges related to Ms. Lewinsky. Today's questioning was conducted by Mr. Starr along with a deputy, W. Hickman Ewing Jr., and three other prosecutors. President Clinton, who went golfing today, did not attend. Appearing with Mrs. Clinton were Mr. Ruff and Cheryl Mills, a deputy, along with David E. Kendall, the Clintons' private lawyer, and an associate, Nicole Seligman. Like all such grand jury testimony, Mrs. Clinton's testimony today was kept secret. Mrs. Clinton finished her testimony less than two hours before she and the President were to attend the annual dinner here of the White House Correspondents Association. Although such dinners are intended to be relaxed and entertaining, the jokes have sometimes been barbed during Mr. Clinton's tenure. Tonight, the President dined in the same ballroom with Paula Corbin Jones, who has accused him of sexual misconduct. But the humor was resolutely nonpolitical, and Mrs. Clinton received a standing ovation from the crowd, which was well aware of her testimony today. In his remarks, Mr. Clinton never referred to Mr. Starr, but he repeatedly drew laughs from the crowd as he discussed the rituals of Washington as if it were a foreign country. ''This Washington is a very special place, and Hillary and I will never forget our visit here,'' he said. Mr. Starr has sent no signals that the Little Rock grand jury will produce new indictments by May 7. Under the independent counsel law, he is required to submit a final report to the special court that supervises him, although such a report would almost certainly not become public for many months. If Mr. Starr determines that Mr. Clinton may have committed an impeachable offense, he must outline the evidence to Congress. Mr. Starr's prosecutors have been looking into whether the Clintons tried to obscure their involvement in Whitewater and its link to Madison Guaranty, which failed at a cost to taxpayers of over $60 million. As part of that investigation, the prosecutors have been examining the legal work Mrs. Clinton did for Madison and related land deals, including a project known as Castle Grande. Officials of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation have told the Little Rock grand jury in recent months that a document drafted by Mrs. Clinton in 1986 was used ''to deceive regulators'' about the financing of Castle Grande. The officials had originally concluded that Mrs. Clinton did little work for Madison or Castle Grande. But they changed their view after seeing her billing records, which disappeared for several years before turning up in the White House residence in 1996. Mrs. Clinton has said she does not remember drafting the document or performing other work on Castle Grande. Such Saturday encounters with prosecutors over Whitewater and related matters have become somewhat familiar at the White House. This was the fourth time that Mrs. Clinton provided testimony under oath there to Mr. Starr, and Mr. Clinton has also been interviewed several times. Mrs. Clinton also testified in January 1996 before a Washington grand jury. And both Clintons were questioned once under oath at the White House -- on a Sunday in June 1994 -- by Robert B. Fiske Jr., Mr. Starr's predecessor as independent counsel. White House aides were furious with Mr. Starr for compelling Mrs. Clinton to appear before the Washington grand jury. But their criticism of him reached new levels after it was disclosed that he was pursuing the accusations regarding Ms. Lewinsky. In a television interview on Jan. 27, Mrs. Clinton called Mr. Starr ''a politically motivated prosecutor who is allied with the right-wing opponents of my husband.'' She accused Mr. Starr and his office of ''scratching for dirt, intimidating witnesses, doing everything possible to try to make some accusation against my husband.'' Today's session was negotiated in secret over several weeks, with even members of the White House counsel's office left in the dark about Mrs. Clinton's appointment with Mr. Starr. Mrs. Clinton's most recent interview with Mr. Starr was on Jan. 14, days before Mr. Starr's investigation was expanded to include the charges regarding Ms. Lewinsky.",

      "author": "Steven Lee Myers",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 A new batch of emails released on Friday portray Hillary Rodham Clinton when she was secretary of state, dealing with everything from political unrest in Honduras and a freeze on Israeli settlements in the Palestinian territories to minor details of her schedule and even a shipment of apples to her office. She discussed the qualities of job candidates: \u201cIt goes w/out saying that someone lacks discretion is not possible,\u201d she wrote in 2009 during a search for a speechwriter \u2014 while her closest aides lavished praise on her (\u201cSecretary of Awesome\u201d was the subject line of one email from her chief of staff, Cheryl D. Mills) and kept her up-to-date on her image in the media. Other emails she received sought privileged access and favors, and in one, the wife of the former prime minister of Britain, Tony Blair, passed on a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 for a young man applying for a job. In all, this second cache of emails that Mrs. Clinton sent and received during 2009 and parts of 2010, released by the State Department by court order, added 1,356 new tiles to the mosaic of her tenure in President Obama\u2019s cabinet. And the monthly release of the emails prescribed by the court ensures that her handling of her electronic correspondence will be updated throughout the 2016 presidential campaign. Last week the inspectors general of the State Department and the nation\u2019s intelligence agencies disclosed that they had discovered classified information on the private email account that Mrs. Clinton used, stating that such material should not have been stored outside secure government computer systems \u2014 in this case, on a server she kept at her house. Mrs. Clinton has maintained that none of the information on her server had been classified, though the State Department classified dozens of documents after the emails were released, first on June 30 and again on Friday. In one email released on Friday, Huma Abedin, a close adviser, forwarded a note written by an aide to the former British foreign minister, David Miliband, that \u201che doesn\u2019t want to send through the system.\u201d Five pages that follow have been redacted entirely, and marked classified until 20 years after Nov. 21, 2009, when the note was forwarded to Mrs. Clinton. The aide, Matthew Gould, said that Mr. Miliband had just returned from Afghanistan\u2019s capital, Kabul, and \u201cvery much wants the secretary (only) to see this note\u201d and to \u201ctalk it over with her\u201d as soon as possible. It was not clear that it was among the emails cited by the inspectors general. A note on the email said it had been classified only on Thursday. It and other emails that were released show that Mrs. Clinton and her aides exchanged notes and memos on all sorts of diplomatic matters, from negotiations with the Russians at a time the Obama administration was seeking to improve relations with the Kremlin to the discussions over the Israeli settlement freeze in 2009. \u201cAbu Mazen wants to see it,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said, referring to the Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas, in response to an email from another close aide, Jacob J. Sullivan. Like the disclosure of tens of thousands of emails by WikiLeaks in 2010, the release of these emails has provided granular details of diplomacy that would normally would not become public for years, if ever. \u201cMany thx for your kind note,\u201d the former American ambassador to Baghdad, Christopher R. Hill, responded when Mrs. Clinton praised the work he was doing. \u201cI wish I felt better about iraqis as a result, but I truly remain worried about these people. They are truly a collective pain in the neck.\u201d Many of the notes involved mundane logistical matters, such as ensuring that her office had the New York State apples Mrs. Clinton liked. Others offered telling insights into the issues and personalities she encountered on the job. Dozens of the emails involved appointments to various positions in the State Department, with people lobbying for themselves and others \u2014 or sometimes against them. Ivo Daalder, a former ambassador to NATO, sent one email detailing \u201cthree major reasons\u201d why one candidate was \u201cnot the right person for the job.\u201d The name, like all of the potential appointees, is redacted, as was the position in question. The emails underscored the privileged status of having Mrs. Clinton\u2019s direct address. Strobe Talbott, the former deputy secretary of state who now heads the Brookings Institution, wrote to her directly, expressing concerns that \u201ctime-sensitive messages\u201d were not getting through Ms. Mills\u2019s State Department email. Mr. Blair\u2019s wife, Cherie, used the personal address at least a dozen times in 2009, pressing Mrs. Clinton to meet with \u201cmy friend,\u201d Sheikha Mozah bint Nasser Al-Missned, a Qatari royal, and praising Mrs. Clinton\u2019s work. With the subject line \u201cNo longer homicidal,\u201d Mrs. Clinton wrote to Ms. Mills about Mark Penn, who was her pollster and chief strategist when she was a presidential candidate in 2008, who had earlier conducted polling for a former prime minister of Thailand, Thaksin Shinawatra. \u201cCould you try to contact Mark Penn to confirm he no longer represents Thaksin before I call Thai PM at 9:30?\u201d Mrs. Clinton wrote.",

A spokesman for the Commission on Presidential Debates said the mistake happened only on commemorative tickets and not on official ones.

      "content": " This Sunday, on the 23d anniversary of her marriage to Bill Clinton, Hillary Rodham Clinton will be in Bulgaria, making a visit that morning to the Faith, Hope and Love Center, a shelter for homeless children in Sofia. The Clintons planned to celebrate their anniversary tonight, aides said. Mr. Clinton bought a gift for Mrs. Clinton on a trip to Philadelphia last Friday, while Mrs. Clinton today brought home takeout ribs, steak and tacos from the President's favorite restaurants in Little Rock, Ark. Joseph Lockhart, the White House press secretary, said Mrs. Clinton's trip was planned ''months ago.'' The President is planning to spend the weekend here, working the telephone, monitoring the budget negotiations, and reading, aides said. On Saturday morning, the President will deliver his weekly radio address live, and it will probably be about the deadlocked budget talks. White House officials said they were reluctant to inquire into the Clintons' anniversary plans, saying that after an agonizing year, the Clintons deserved some privacy. Mr. Clinton has said he has been trying to repair damage done his family by his affair with Monica S. Lewinsky, a former White House intern. This will be the first anniversary that the Clintons have been apart since moving into the White House. A year ago, Mr. Clinton spent six hours on their anniversary in the Oval Office complex, in part to prepare for a trip to Latin America. ''Her Calvinism will let me work, but no golf,'' Mr. Clinton joked with reporters. That day, Ms. Lewinsky met with Mr. Clinton in a study off the Oval Office, to discuss efforts to find her a job in New York, according to her testimony before the grand jury here. The meeting was disclosed in the report to Congress by the independent counsel, Kenneth W. Starr. Ms. Lewinsky testified that her sexual relationship with Mr. Clinton ended months earlier. Mrs. Clinton plans to depart on Saturday for a trip that will take her to the Czech Republic and Bulgaria. In Sofia, she will attend a conference titled ''Women in the 21st Century,'' part of a project to encourage sustainable development in Southeastern Europe. In Prague, she will attend another conference, this one called ''Forum 2000,'' to discuss globalization and the next millennium. She is to return Prague Tuesday. The Clintons were married on Oct. 11, 1975 in a simple ceremony in their home in Fayetteville, Ark. They spent their honeymoon in Acapulco, Mexico.",

      "author": "Amy Chozick",
      "content": " In Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2019s first bid for president in 2008, her campaign seemed determined to make a powerful point: She was strong. She was tough. She was ready to lead. In her new book, even as she lays out her foreign policy vision, Mrs. Clinton shows a side of herself that campaign did not: human, motherly, jokey, self-deprecating. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s latest memoir, \u201cHard Choices,\u201d delivers a potent mix of feminine gusto and diplomatic capers. In doing so, she offers a sharp contrast to the argument that she needed to diminish her softer side. In retelling her four years as secretary of state, Mrs. Clinton weaves moments like planning the wedding of her daughter, Chelsea \u2014 she signed an email to the State Department staff \u201cM.O.T.B.,\u201d short for mother of the bride \u2014 while she was also negotiating with China. She attended the rooftop wedding of one of her daughter\u2019s closest friends the night before the raid in Pakistan that led to the killing of Osama bin Laden. One of the guests asked her, \u201cSecretary Clinton, do you think we\u2019ll ever get bin Laden?\u201d Mrs. Clinton writes in a straightforward and optimistic prose that drifts from policy discussions to upbeat generalities about the United States and public service: \u201cDoing what\u2019s hard will continue to make our country great.\u201d She opens a chapter about American relations with Europe with a Girl Scouts song from elementary school. (\u201cMake new friends, but keep the old.\u201d) And she describes answering questions in South Korea about how she deals with \u201cmisogynistic leaders\u201d and how would she \u201cdescribe love.\u201d Of that event, Mrs. Clinton writes, \u201cIt seemed that these women felt connected to me in a personal way.\u201d They treated her, she said, \u201cas though I was a friend or mentor, rather than a government official.\u201d On the airplanes where she spent much of her time, Mrs. Clinton enjoyed local delicacies like Oaxacan cheese in Mexico, smoked salmon in Ireland and tropical fruit in Cambodia. She mentions her honeymoon twice, calls her husband her \u201cbest friend\u201d and closes her story much as she begins it: Describing a peaceful walk with her husband near their home in Chappaqua, N.Y. \u201cThere have been too few quiet moments like this over the years,\u201d she writes. \u201cI want to savor them.\u201d Along with the humanizing moments of the book, which is scheduled for release on Tuesday but was obtained in advance by The New York Times, Mrs. Clinton makes clear her concept of America\u2019s place in the world. At times, as in her dealings with Arab leaders while protests unfolded in their countries, Mrs. Clinton articulates that idea without \u201cthe usual diplomatic niceties.\u201d Not every situation called for such a blunt response, she writes, and humor could be a valuable tool. \u201cIn politics a sense of humor is essential,\u201d she writes. She celebrates the \u201creset\u201d button she presented to Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov of Russia in 2009, while acknowledging that the button itself used the Russian word for \u201covercharged\u201d by mistake. \u201cIf our goal had been to break the ice and make sure no one would ever forget the \u2018reset,\u2019 then our translation error had certainly done that,\u201d she wrote. (The North Koreans nicknamed her \u201ca funny lady,\u201d she says at one point, though not because of her sense of humor.) In a more serious vein, Mrs. Clinton writes that her perspectives occasionally clashed with the White House, particularly in her tough stance on Russia. \u201cNot everyone agreed with my relatively harsh analysis,\u201d she writes. \u201cRussia under Putin remains frozen between the past they can\u2019t let go of and the future they can\u2019t bring themselves to embrace.\u201d She and President Obama also disagreed on whether to arm the rebels in Syria. She argued in favor of training and providing weapons to the moderates who were fighting President Bashar al-Assad. Mr. Obama disagreed. \u201cNo one likes to lose a debate, including me,\u201d she said. \u201cBut this was the president\u2019s call, and I respected his deliberations and decision.\u201d Critics are likely to pounce on parts of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s account, particularly sections that portray her as stepping in to improve the American relationships with allies that had become strained under President George W. Bush. \u201cMany people were put off by the \u2018you\u2019re either with us or against us\u2019 style,\u201d she writes. Mrs. Clinton may also face criticism for being overly cautious in her narrative and for avoiding taking specific stands on issues that have arisen since she left office, like the revelations about the National Security Agency\u2019s widespread collection of private data. \u201cWithout security, liberty is fragile,\u201d she writes. \u201cWithout liberty, security is oppressive.\u201d But more often than not, Mrs. Clinton portrays herself as in step with Mr. Obama and the White House during her tenure at the State Department. She says their circles of aides and supporters were to blame for any lingering tensions from the hard-fought primary in which Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama were rivals. \u201cThe preposterous charge of racism against Bill was particularly painful,\u201d Mrs. Clinton writes in recalling the 2008 race. \u201cAs to the sexism that surfaced during the campaign, I knew it arose from cultural and psychological attitudes about women\u2019s roles in society, but that didn\u2019t make it any easier for me and my supporters.\u201d Mrs. Clinton also pushed back against Obama advisers who attacked Sarah Palin, then the Republican vice-presidential nominee, for trying to win over women who had backed Mrs. Clinton in the primaries. \u201cI was not going to attack Palin just for being a woman appealing for support from other women,\u201d she writes. In Mrs. Clinton\u2019s early months as secretary of state, when the American television journalists Euna Lee and Laura Ling were imprisoned in North Korea, the White House argued against former President Bill Clinton personally visiting Kim Jong-il, North Korea\u2019s authoritarian leader, to free them. \u201cSome may have harbored negative feelings toward Bill from the 2008 primary campaign,\u201d she writes. Throughout her retelling of her diplomatic efforts, Mrs. Clinton weaves in more intimate moments. In a chapter about the Arab Spring, she tells the story of a female security guard in Saudi Arabia who asked Huma Abedin, a Clinton aide, in Arabic if the secretary of state would pose for a photo. They ducked into a nearby room. \u201cThe woman pulled off her veil, revealing a huge smile,\u201d she writes. \u201cThe camera snapped, and the veil came back down. Welcome to Saudi Arabia.\u201d In the same chapter, Mrs. Clinton explains her view of the uprisings that were sweeping the Middle East. \u201cIf Arab leaders, many of whom were America\u2019s partners, failed to embrace the need for change,\u201d she said, \u201cthey risked losing control of their increasingly young and alienated populations and opening the door to unrest, conflict and terrorists.\u201d One of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s biggest challenges has been explaining the connection between diplomacy and national security and her work advancing the rights of women and girls. She devotes the book\u2019s final chapters to that effort. Mrs. Clinton has a blitz of media appearances lined up to promote the book, including a nationwide tour that will start on Tuesday with a reading at the Barnes & Noble store in Union Square in New York. Members of Ready for Hillary, an outside group that supports a potential Clinton run for president in 2016, will trail along in a red, white and blue \u201cHillary Bus\u201d in an effort to drum up grass-roots enthusiasm. Mrs. Clinton writes that she has not decided whether she will run: \u201cThe time for another hard choice will come soon.\u201d But she does take time to briefly describe her hopes for Americans in choosing their next president. \u201cUltimately, what happens in 2016 should be about what kind of future Americans want for themselves and their children \u2014 and grandchildren,\u201d Mrs. Clinton writes. And, she says, the questions are not \u201cDo you want to be president?\u201d or \u201cCan you win?\u201d but \u201cWhat\u2019s your vision for America?\u201d and \u201cCan you lead us there?\u201d",

      "author": "Lizette Alvarez",
      "content": " As Hillary Rodham Clinton's bus slowly chugged along the roads in upstate New York recently on a tour for historic preservation, she glanced out the window at a woman holding aloft a cardboard sign. It said, ''You Go Girl.'' It appears that Mrs. Clinton has been trying to do just that, and in some respects, is succeeding, even as her husband prepares to face a Federal grand jury on Monday about his relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky. Mrs. Clinton's approval ratings across the country are higher than ever. Instead of sequestering herself at the White House, away from the klieg lights and the inevitable questions about Ms. Lewinsky, Mrs. Clinton has crowded her schedule with things to do and people to see. In the Hamptons two weekends ago, Mrs. Clinton dropped in on the glitterati, firing up a crowd of 1,000 people who whooped as she introduced her husband. And she has helped several Democratic candidates, raising $150,000 in Philadelphia for one candidate two weeks ago. Once in a while, Mrs. Clinton has stirred things up by dishing out a few select words about the Lewinsky matter, in which a grand jury is investigating whether President Clinton lied when asked under oath if he had had a sexual relationship with the former intern and whether he tried to cover it up. In January, Mrs. Clinton placed the blame on a ''right-wing conspiracy'' spearheaded by the Whitewater independent counsel, Kenneth W. Starr, and his allies, for trying to ruin her husband's Presidency. Just today, in an interview published in The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, Mrs. Clinton said prejudice against Arkansas was driving the attacks on her husband.''I think a lot of this is prejudice against our state,'' Mrs. Clinton told the newspaper. ''They wouldn't do this if we were from some other state.'' Some Republicans in Arkansas seized on Mrs. Clinton's remark. ''I know she must be going through a lot of stress, but I don't think anyone in Arkansas believes this is occurring because of prejudice towards the state,'' said Representative Asa Hutchinson. ''It's inexplicable.'' Representative Jay Dickey, another Arkansas Republican, was harsher. ''It is sad and unfortunate that Arkansas is depicted by the First Lady as a backward state, worthy of ridicule and prejudice,'' Mr. Dickey said. ''It would be much better if the First Lady would make a mature and responsible assessment of the situation and not blame us Arkansans for their troubles.'' But no one disputes that Mrs. Clinton has swayed a number of Americans, especially women, over to her side in the past eight months. According to a CBS News poll conducted July 19 through July 21, 50 percent of those surveyed said they held a favorable opinion of Mrs. Clinton and 26 percent say they did not. In previous years, only 35 percent or so of Americans had expressed support for Mrs. Clinton. Some political consultants say that after six years, people are starting to like Mrs. Clinton and her reconfigured role as First Lady. Others point directly at Ms. Lewinsky, and say that the public sympathizes with Mrs. Clinton and that has softened her image in a way that speeches and press releases never could. ''She's the best person they can put out there,'' said Ed Goeas, a Republican pollster in Arkansas. ''She's kind of standing by her man, and has been determined to do exactly that. Some people feel sorry for her. Some respect her. It's probably a combination of both.'' Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster, said, ''I think that the First Lady has handled this whole set of attacks with grace and intelligence and wit, and people admire that.'' There is no doubt that Mrs. Clinton's legal background, and her own experience as a subpoenaed witness before Mr. Starr's Whitewater grand jury, makes her one of the President's most valuable strategists. And, in fact, she is said to be directly involved in meetings with lawyers and others on the Lewinsky matter. But the private Mrs. Clinton has remained steadfastly elusive. How does she broach the subject of Ms. Lewinswky with her husband? Do they talk about the infamous dress? Does she advise him on what to say? The answers are all subject to speculation, but little else. ''I think at best this is an extremely difficult time and I think the President and Mrs. Clinton are probably communicating, in many ways through their lawyer, David Kendall,'' DeeDee Myers, Mr. Clinton's former press secretary, said on the ABC news program ''This Week.'' ''I think these issues are just too difficult for them to discuss with each other in many respects,'' Ms. Myers added. ''I mean, nobody knows, ''so it's tough to speculate. But it's----. These are the kind of issues that I think husbands and wives don't often sit down and sort of have frank conversations about.'' At a fund-raiser at the home of the actors Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger in the Hamptons at the beginning of this month, Mrs. Clinton got the crowd fired up for her husband, then gave him a hug before he took the microphone and delivered five minutes of subdued remarks. Mrs. Clinton's staff said she thrives on her public appearances, especially when she is talking about children's issues, health care and the encroaching millennium. ''She believes that if you spend one day pacing around the White House, that's one day you are not doing something to advance the agenda of the President,'' said Neel Lattimore, Mrs. Clinton's former press secretary. Earlier this year, she approached the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and offered to attend a number of fund-raisers for House and Senate candidates, many of them challengers facing uphill battles. She has attended six fund-raisers since June and is expected to attend several more over the next few weeks. Dan Sallick, the communications director for the campaign committee, said that she was the party's biggest draw, after the President. Just before a special election in Albuquerque, N.M., Mrs. Clinton drew 2,000 at a college gym on 48 hours notice, Mr. Sallick said, adding that she had helped involve women who did not typically turn out to show up and write checks. ''Besides the President, who tends to do more fund-raising for the national party committee, she is in the most demand of any other Democratic official,'' Mr. Sallick said. Lydia Spottswood, a Wisconsin candidate for the House, said Mrs. Clinton attended a small reception in Milwaukee that drew $60,000. Ms. Spottswood said Mrs. Clinton's wifely travails had certainly played a hand in her popularity. ''There but for the grace of God,'' Ms. Spottswood said. ''Any woman could find herself with unwelcomed rumors. She has dealt with it with so much dignity and grace, it has resonated with people.''",

      "author": "John Harwood",
      "content": " The first female vice-presidential nominee got a full helping of gender stereotype. \u201cLet me help you with the difference,\u201d George H. W. Bush told the nominee, Geraldine Ferraro, in their 1984 debate, \u201cbetween Iran and the embassy in Lebanon.\u201d The first female presidential nominee faces no danger from such an attack. Hillary Clinton holds clear advantages over Donald Trump when it comes to what voters once considered masculine strengths they sought in a leader. That flows logically from the background of the candidates. Mr. Trump has developed real estate and starred in reality television; Mrs. Clinton served as first lady, senator and secretary of state, where she carved out a reputation for a relatively aggressive approach to foreign policy, including in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria. Yet while gender bias remains a real issue on many fronts, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s standing reflects the evolution of assumptions about gender roles ever since the feminist movement gathered force in the 1960s. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a half-century of evolution in attitudes,\u201d said Ruth Mandel, director of the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University. American voters once compared male and female candidates through the lens of characteristics they assumed to be inherent. They generally granted women the presumption of greater honesty and empathy; they presumed men, in politics as in business, possessed superior strength and competence. Those beliefs loomed especially large over the election of the United States\u2019 commander in chief. The first female president was widely expected to be a Republican, on the theory that the party\u2019s reputation for national security prowess could offset a female nominee\u2019s political vulnerabilities. That calculus has changed. Although it\u2019s a long way from parity, female candidates have become much more common: The 43 women nominated by the two major parties for congressional races in 1974 grew to 121 by 1994, and 174 by 2014. An electorate polarized by party now judges candidates by their affiliation more than anything else. \u201cGender stereotypes have gone away almost entirely,\u201d said Jennifer Lawless, an American University political scientist, who compared views of male and female congressional candidates for a recent book, \u201cWomen on the Run.\u201d Americans have grown accustomed to observing female leaders elsewhere, including Margaret Thatcher and Theresa May in Britain, and Angela Merkel in Germany. At home, the Democratic pollster Peter Hart said, the rise of some women to the top of major corporations smoothed a path for voters to envision a woman in the Oval Office. \u201cThere is much greater acceptance of women being able to be seen in that commander-in-chief role,\u201d Mr. Hart said. He advised the 1984 presidential campaign of Walter Mondale, who picked Mrs. Ferraro as his running mate. Mrs. Ferraro, then in her sixth year in the House of Representatives, didn\u2019t shrink from the \u201clet me help you\u201d barb in her debate. \u201cI almost resent, Vice President Bush, your patronizing attitude that you have to teach me about foreign policy,\u201d she shot back. Mrs. Clinton need not fear that line of argument. In the poll Mr. Hart helps conduct for NBC News and The Wall Street Journal, voters last month preferred her over Mr. Trump by 26 percentage points on conducting foreign policy, 18 points on handling a crisis, and 11 points on serving as commander in chief. Nor does Mrs. Clinton, whose truthfulness was called into question most recently over her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state, benefit from any presumption of honesty. Just 22 percent of voters in the NBC-Wall Street Journal poll rated her highly as \u201chonest and straightforward,\u201d the sort of finding that Mr. Trump has worked to exploit by frequently referring to her as \u201cCrooked Hillary.\u201d Mr. Trump has also sought to attack Mrs. Clinton by suggesting that the success of her campaign is rooted almost entirely in her gender. \u201cIf Hillary Clinton were a man, I don\u2019t think she\u2019d get 5 percent of the vote,\u201d he said last spring. \u201cThe only thing she\u2019s got going is the women\u2019s card.\u201d Stereotypes about women haven\u2019t vanished. Wielded with subtlety, Ms. Lawless said, they can still benefit male politicians among some older and less-partisan voters. But Mr. Trump alienates younger and better-educated voters more \u201cby being so overt in his rhetoric,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s actually saying to people that he is sexist, and they\u2019re not O.K. with that.\u201d",

      "author": "Carl Hulse",
      "content": " It is the talk of the capital \u2014 a presidential ticket featuring a Northeastern liberal Democrat and a Sunbelt Republican with a military background and an independent streak. Sure, they've had differences in the past, but they have moved beyond them at this point and might want to consider teaming up. John Kerry and John McCain? Hardly. How about Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democrat of New York, and Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina? The two appeared on \"Fox News Sunday\" and seem to be building a powerful political partnership despite Mr. Graham's leading role in the impeachment of former President Bill Clinton. \"I believe in redemption and growth and people who were previously misguided can see the light,\" Mrs. Clinton said about Mr. Graham's previous connection with her family. \"But on several issues, we have found common cause.\" The two lawmakers, both of whom sit on the Armed Services Committee and have been pressing the inquiry on the Iraqi prisoner abuse, are part of a bipartisan effort to increase health care coverage for members of the National Guard and reserves. Mr. Graham suggested that his Senate experience with Mrs. Clinton had given him a new appreciation of things. \"When you look at what we have in common, it really does change you, and I hope for the better,\" said Mr. Graham. \"Yes, politics is fun, but some of the things that people say are not fun, and I've been guilty of saying some things that I shouldn't have said, and I've had some things said about me that I wish others wouldn't have said. The future is what this is about \u2014 not the past.\" Speaking of that other potential presidential ticket, Mr. Graham, who ran Mr. McCain's campaign in South Carolina in 2000, said he was certain Mr. McCain would not run with Mr. Kerry. Mrs. Clinton, however, said the idea had considerable merit. And if it doesn't work out, perhaps Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Graham can talk in 2008.",

      "author": "Albert R. Hunt | Bloomberg View",
      "content": " Hillary Clinton could be in for some political peril. Sure, by winning 11 of the 17 contests since her New Hampshire drubbing, and running away with the delegate count, she\u2019s not far from sewing up the Democratic presidential nomination. It\u2019s the Republicans, not the Democrats, who face bitter divides that endanger the party\u2019s future. Mrs. Clinton is riding high; that\u2019s the problem. \u201cHer history is that whenever she gets ahead and looks in good shape, she reverts to her worst form,\u201d said Peter D. Hart, a leading Democratic pollster, citing Mrs. Clinton\u2019s stellar first debate performance. The Democrats\u2019 confidence is based on the perceived folly of Republicans\u2019 nominating Donald J. Trump. But a lot can change in a few months and the Democrats\u2019 own house has some needs. There is a demonstrable lack of enthusiasm about Mrs. Clinton, the likely nominee, underscored by the low turnouts in most contests. She is identified as part of the establishment by a restless electorate, and she is neither especially liked nor trusted by many swing voters, and even some Democrats. \u201cShe seems out of sync with the electorate,\u201d J. Ann Selzer said after looking at the surveys conducted by her firm, Selzer & Company, for Bloomberg, as well as primary exit polls. \u201cFor someone who started her campaign on a listening tour she doesn\u2019t seem to be listening.\u201d Mrs. Clinton\u2019s likability issues go back a ways. In New Hampshire eight years ago, Barack Obama cracked, \u201cYou\u2019re likable enough, Hillary.\u201d The lack of trust is more recent. Her shortcomings, as perceived by voters, would change little. \u201cShe laps the field on competence and skills to do the job,\u201d Mr. Hart said. \u201cWhat she needs to do is neutralize the personal distaste.\u201d He suggested that \u201cshe needs an event most days that is personal, human, sometimes even light.\u201d He added that the public needs to see more of the emotional side she displayed at a town hall in December, when she comforted a girl with asthma who had been bullied. David Plouffe, who managed Mr. Obama\u2019s winning campaign against Mrs. Clinton eight years ago, concurs, noting that it\u2019s a myth that voters know all about her given that she has been around for a quarter century: \u201cThe key in this race is to define the race, her opponent and herself.\u201d Mr. Plouffe said this definition has to be \u201cauthentic\u201d and \u201ctied to her sense of advocacy, which would reveal interesting sides of herself.\u201d If she did this well, he added, it could offer a comparative advantage with Mr. Trump \u2014 \u201cthis is a place he can\u2019t go.\u201d The trustworthiness problem is deeper, more difficult. It stems from some issues that are unfair to her, such as the 2012 terrorist attack on a United States diplomatic installation in Benghazi, Libya, in which four Americans were killed. Capitol Hill Republicans tried and failed to use the incident to tarnish her. But some of her wounds are self-inflicted, such as her use of a private email server as secretary of state and the huge speaking fees she received for private talks to Wall Street companies. Democratic strategists suggest that there\u2019s no easy way to deal with it. Some talk about her doing a so-called Sister Souljah moment, a reference to her husband\u2019s criticism of a black rapper in 1992. This would require Mrs. Clinton to take an unpopular, even risky position, displaying courage \u2014 a character point. That, however, is probably not in her political DNA. A general election campaign against Mr. Trump would be filled with fear and loathing. His Republican rivals Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz can tell her how dirty the fight against the New York billionaire can get. Leading Democrats are confident that with her superior knowledge and intellectual agility, she can handle this. What worries them more is her recurring tendency, when on top, to show hubris.",

      "author": "Amy Chozick",
      "content": " CLEVELAND \u2014 With a single response in 1992 to a question about her legal career, Hillary Clinton became a radical feminist in her critics\u2019 imagination, the Lady Macbeth who was an affront to the choices so many other women had made. \u201cI suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas, but what I decided to do was to fulfill my profession,\u201d she said during Bill Clinton\u2019s first presidential campaign. The blowback was intense and she spent weeks apologizing, saying that she respected women who chose to stay at home and raise children. Family Circle magazine invited her to and Barbara Bush to submit recipes for a chocolate-chip cookie bake-off, and she obliged. Mrs. Clinton would spend years trying to soften her image, to contort herself into the more traditional first lady persona of devoted wife and mother. But on Friday night, with Mrs. Clinton making her final push to become the first woman in the Oval Office, she did something no one could have expected her to do: She reclaimed the cookies line. In a multimedia explosion of hip-hop and girl power, with Beyonc\u00e9 performing with a gaggle of backup dancers in blue pantsuits, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s words from 24 years ago appeared on a giant screen above the stage. \u201cI suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas, but what I decided to do was to fulfill my profession,\u201d flashed on the screen. Signed: \u201cHillary Clinton.\u201d It was a subtle but stunning moment for a candidate who has tried to play it safe in the final weeks of the presidential campaign. But it also perfectly fit Mrs. Clinton\u2019s message that a victory for her would be a victory for all women, especially as she continues to hammer Donald J. Trump for his treatment of women. A spokesman for Mrs. Clinton said that the performers, who also included Jay Z, Chance the Rapper and Big Sean, had creative control of the concert, but that the campaign supported the signage. By the time Mrs. Clinton came on stage at the Wolstein Center to close out the get-out-the-vote rally here, her words had disappeared. She did not mention them; instead, Mrs. Clinton quoted Jay Z. \u201cJay memorably said something we should all recall: Rosa Parks sat so Martin Luther could walk and Martin Luther walked so Barack Obama could run and Barack Obama ran so all the children could fly,\u201d she said. \u201cWell, we have unfinished business to do,\u201d she continued. \u201cMore barriers to break and, with your help, a glass ceiling to crack once and for all.\u201d",

Footage from a 1979 interview of Mrs. Clinton as Arkansas\u2019s first lady begins the commercial, saying, \u201cOne of the areas that I\u2019ve particularly been interested in is the area of children.\u201d The ad then splices together public footage from throughout Mrs. Clinton\u2019s extended career: the first lady of Arkansas, the presidential candidate\u2019s wife, the first lady, the senator from New York, the secretary of state, all coming together in a cohesive manner, sounding almost like Mrs. Clinton\u2019s current stump speech. \u201cIt\u2019s time to protect the next generation,\u201d Mrs. Clinton as Senate candidate says from a debate stage. \u201cFill the lives of our children with possibility and hope,\u201d the 2008 presidential candidate Mrs. Clinton says. \u201cI\u2019ve spent my life fighting for children, families and our country, and I\u2019m not stopping now,\u201d Mrs. Clinton says in 2015, before closing with a twist on the requisite approval line: \u201cI\u2019m Hillary Clinton, and I\u2019ve always approved this message.\u201d Previous advertisements from the Clinton campaign have focused on her record, leaving the narration to an anonymous voice. Now the campaign has given the microphone to the candidate, as voters hear, in her own words, Mrs. Clinton talking about children and families in five decades. The ad does not, however, give any details showing how she championed their cause. The ad makes no verifiable assertions. On Iowa broadcast and cable channels. It\u2019s a continuing contrast between the advertising styles of the Clinton and Bernie Sanders campaigns. Mr. Sanders\u2019s ads are packed with promises and his platform, like his goals of universal health care and free public college. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s ads focus on her record and experience. This one uses her own words over the years, making emotional pleas about families and giving the ad a hopeful feeling.",

The win still leaves Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic nominee, about 60 Electoral College votes shy of Mr. Trump, who stunned many over the past 18 months with his improbable rise to the nation\u2019s highest office. Mrs. Clinton now has 232 electoral votes; Mr. Trump has 290, 20 more than the 270 needed to win. Michigan, with 16 electoral votes, is the only state that The Associated Press has not yet called for either candidate; Mr. Trump is ahead by a slim 0.3 percentage points there. Although Mrs. Clinton soundly lost the Electoral College vote, which elects the president, she remains slightly ahead in the national popular vote.",

But the lawyer later backed off, saying it probably would not happen. The lawyer, Dan Guthrie, who represents one of two Arkansas bankers on trial, suggested calling Mrs. Clinton after prosecutors were allowed to introduce evidence about $180,000 in personal loans that Bill Clinton and his wife received from an Arkansas bank in connection with Mr. Clinton's 1990 campaign for governor. Mrs. Clinton prepared the financial statements that accompanied their loan applications to the Perry County Bank, whose two owners are on trial, and the defense may need to question her to explain them, Mr. Guthrie said. But less than 90 minutes later, Mr. Guthrie said he would not seek Mrs. Clinton's testimony unless the prosecution contended that the loans were illegal. The chief prosecutor, W. Hickman Ewing, said he would not do so, but he did not rule out alleging that the loans were favors to the Clintons. The indictment accuses Herby Branscum Jr. and Robert M. Hill of submitting false expense vouchers to the Perry County bank and using the money on political contributions. They are also accused of conspiring with Bruce Lindsey, now deputy White House counsel, to hide large cash withdrawals by the 1990 campaign and falsifying bank records.",

      "content": " Hillary Clinton took questions at a news conference on an airport tarmac in New York on Thursday, one night after a presidential forum on national security issues. Here are the highlights: \u2022 In an opening statement, Mrs. Clinton said that Donald J. Trump had \u201cbizarrely\u201d praised President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia at the forum on Wednesday, when he suggested that he preferred Mr. Putin\u2019s leadership qualities to those of President Obama. \u201cThat is not just unpatriotic and insulting to the people of our country, as well as to our commander in chief, it is scary,\u201d she said. \u2022 Asked why she is not \u201crunning away\u201d with an election against someone viewed so unfavorably, Mrs. Clinton said she had always expected a close race. \u201cI feel we\u2019re in a strong position,\u201d she said, adding that she was taking nothing for granted. \u2022 Responding to the suggestion from some Republicans that she had not smiled enough at the forum, Mrs. Clinton said she was \u201ctalking about serious issues last night.\u201d Asked if she was held to a double standard because she is a woman, she said: \u201cI\u2019m going to let all of you ponder that last question. I think there will be a lot of Ph.D. theses and popular journalism writing on that subject for years to come.\u201d \u2022 Mrs. Clinton condemned Mr. Trump\u2019s allusion on Wednesday to his intelligence briefings, where he suggested that officials were disillusioned with the Obama administration. \u201cI think what he said was totally inappropriate and undisciplined,\u201d she said. \u201cI would never comment on any aspect of an intelligence briefing that I received.\u201d \u2022 A reporter shouted a question about Gary Johnson, the libertarian candidate who appeared not to know what Aleppo, a war-torn Syrian city, was in an interview earlier in the day. \u201cWell, you can look on the map and find Aleppo,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said, smiling. \u2022 Defending her claim that terrorist leaders are hoping for Mr. Trump\u2019s election, Mrs. Clinton cited a counterterrorism expert\u2019s suggestion that a Trump win \u201cwould give even more motivation to jihadi.\u201d \u201cThat is a gift for ISIS,\u201d she said.",

      "subtitle": "Hillary Clinton, an Evolutionary TaleBy James BennetPRINT EDITIONJanuary 20, 1997, Page A00014",
      "author": "James Bennet",
      "content": " There is something startling and even poignant in the speed with which White House spokesmen quash suggestions that Hillary Rodham Clinton helps create her husband's policies. Just last week, Michael D. McCurry, the White House press secretary, did not hesitate when asked whether Mrs. Clinton was a ''prime motivating force'' in drawing the Clinton Administration's attention to the plight of the District of Columbia. ''I'd say it's more accurate the other way around,'' he replied. Mr. McCurry said that it was President Clinton's interest that ''led a number of people throughout the Administration to think about what they can do to lend support,'' thereby lumping the President's wife of 21 years with assorted unnamed bureaucrats, or ''others throughout the Administration.'' But in an interview on Friday, Erskine B. Bowles, Mr. Clinton's chief of staff, gave Mrs. Clinton more credit. ''She is the one that actually originally came to the President with thoughts about doing something in D.C.,'' he said. Scorched by the fallout after Mrs. Clinton's leadership in seeking universal health care coverage, the White House has labored to play down her influence, describing a conversion from policy-maker to speech-maker, helpmate and goodwill ambassador, a seemingly docile role for an accomplished lawyer with more than two decades of experience in public life and no shortage of opinions. But while the White House may lump her various causes under the anodyne rubric of ''children's issues,'' Mrs. Clinton is still pursuing a far broader agenda of causes -- including foreign development, immunization in the inner cities and expanding financial credit for women -- than almost any predecessor in the undefined role of First Lady. Mr. Clinton's aides acknowledge that she remains among the President's most powerful advisers, and Administration officials credit her with fighting internally to preserve or increase their budgets. ''I think she's easily the most influential First Lady in history,'' said Michael Beschloss, a historian of the Presidency. The evolution of Mrs. Clinton's role parallels the arc of the Clinton Administration itself. She may no longer be trying to rework the nation's health care system, but neither is the Administration undertaking such a monumental cause. She may have taken to the bully pulpit and embraced politically milder goals, but then, so has her husband. At all levels of the White House, officials walk on eggshells when questioned about Mrs. Clinton's plans. Asked whether he would like to see her take more of a public leadership role, Vice President Al Gore said quickly: ''That is completely for her to decide.'' Mrs. Clinton has been vague about her intentions during the second term, and she has declined most interview requests, including one for this article. In an interview broadcast today on C-Span, she described the political difficulty of spelling out her role as First Lady, a position she called ''a struggle.'' ''On the one hand, people want a wife of a President to be concerned and caring about the issues confronting the country and to work on something of public interest,'' she said. ''On the other hand, they don't want her to do it in a public way on a policy level.'' But she indicated that she would not confine herself to noncontroversial issues, offering this daunting tongue-twister: ''I'm not about to start caring about things that I've never cared about because it's not appropriate in somebody else's mind for me to continue to care about what I've always cared about.'' Some of her allies believe that Mrs. Clinton's public image suffered from her early honesty about her influence. Previous First Ladies, they argue, cannily downplayed their impact. ''It's almost as if she's been penalized a little bit because she didn't hide parts of herself,'' said one associate, speaking, like many, on condition of anonymity. A New York Times/CBS Newspoll shows that most Americans agree with that analysis. Seventy percent said Mrs. Clinton had the same influence as previous First Ladies, but that it was ''just more visible.'' Given that view, and the vivid role Mrs. Clinton played in the first two years of the Administration, it may be too late for the White House to camouflage her, as it tried to do during the campaign. Further, since the election, Mrs. Clinton has demonstrated that she will not bury her sharper views with an avalanche of First-Lady-like bromides. In a speech in Australia in late November, Mrs. Clinton criticized the free market, ''which by definition knows the price of everything but the value of nothing,'' and reported that in the United States, women were still striving ''to claim their share of personal, political, economic and civic power.'' ''Will we stop pigeon-holing women and invoking stereotypes that limit their potential?'' she asked, posing a question she might well put to some on her husband's staff. Many in the White House believe it is the press that wants to pigeonhole Mrs. Clinton, a point Mr. McCurry made last week as he minimized her role in the District of Columbia. ''Every time she says anything about any subject,'' he said, ''everyone rushes off to write some new thing about some new role.'' Although Mrs. Clinton's popularity has climbed in polls, some of her allies acknowledge that the drumbeat of scandals touching her, particularly Whitewater, darkened her image. In a typical late-night jab last week, David Letterman told his television audience that one goal of the designer of Mrs. Clinton's inaugural dress was to make the sleeves long enough to hide her handcuffs. Mrs. Clinton's devoted friends talk about her thoughtfulness, about birthdays remembered and losses understood. They describe a complex woman with a wicked, teasing sense of humor and a rollicking laugh. And, sadly, they add that that person rarely comes across in public, because she has to be guarded. ''You can see her sometimes almost censoring the first and second and third thing that comes into her head,'' said Diane Blair, an old friend who is a political science professor at the University of Arkansas. But others say that Mrs. Clinton was trained to be publicly stern. Michael Conway, another old friend, noted that only 10 percent of the students in Mrs. Clinton's Yale Law School class were women. And when the two of them worked together on the House Judiciary Committee's impeachment inquiry, he said, 2 of the 40 lawyers were women. ''That's her formative training,'' he said. ''She was trained to be a woman lawyer, and particularly to be a trial lawyer, and had to be more determined, more intense, more humorless, to be accepted.'' Criticizing her for seeming that way in public, he said, was ''sort of like criticizing a graduate of West Point for being too rigid and too militaristic.'' Still, officials throughout the Administration are beating down Mrs. Clinton's door to line her up as a speaker. They just don't necessarily talk up her role in molding the policies she speaks about. ''The policies are made,'' said Donna E. Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, referring to the new welfare law. ''Now we need to go out to talk to the people.'' Others in the Administration said that they have learned to count on Mrs. Clinton as more than a spokeswoman. ''I don't think that the Endowment would be alive today if it weren't for strong White House support, and I'm sure she plays a very important role,'' said Jane Alexander, chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts. At the Agency for International Development, Brian Atwood, the administrator, said of Mrs. Clinton's grasp of complex development issues: ''She understands these issues better than 90 percent of the people who operate within the foreign policy community.'' Mrs. Clinton has been working with A.I.D. to import to inner cities lessons learned abroad, on child immunization, for example, and inexpensive techniques to combat diarrhea. She has taken a particularly strong interest in ''microenterprise lending,'' or efforts in developing nations and troubled cities to lend small amounts of money for new businesses, often run by women. It is no coincidence, Mr. Atwood said, that the Administration is seeking to slightly increase the budget for A.I.D. next year. ''She deserves more credit for that,'' he said, ''than anyone.''",

      "author": "Amy Chozick",
      "content": " The name Hillary Rodham first appeared in the pages of The New York Times 47 years ago, in a 1969 article about her commencement address at Wellesley, the women\u2019s college in Massachusetts. It was five years before her husband, Bill Clinton, would be mentioned in The Times. Since then, The Times has covered her rise, beginning with her role as a lawyer and governor\u2019s wife who first gained the national spotlight in Arkansas. She then became an influential first lady, United States senator, secretary of state and presidential candidate (twice). Here are some highlights from over the years. The country wasn\u2019t sure what to make of Mrs. Clinton when she first burst on the national stage during the 1992 presidential campaign. A product of the feminist movement who had followed her husband to Arkansas, Mrs. Clinton seemed to be breaking the mold of candidate\u2019s wife. And yet, talk of her hairstyle still permeated many conversations \u2026 and has ever since. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s 1993 interview with The New York Times Magazine, in which she expounded on the \u201cpolitics of meaning\u201d and her Methodism and New Age beliefs, was met with widespread ridicule. It has often been cited as a reason for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s reluctance to discuss her spiritual side. She even resisted wearing white for years after the magazine\u2019s cover portrayed her as a saintly figure. Soon after her husband\u2019s inauguration, Mrs. Clinton was appointed by the president as head of a task force on health care reform. It was her first time working to develop policy on a national stage, and it \u201cran into a political buzzsaw,\u201d as The Times found in a 1994 post-mortem on what critics nicknamed Hillarycare. Instead of cowering after a White House scandal broadcast Bill Clinton\u2019s infidelities around the world, Mrs. Clinton did the opposite: She ran for the Senate in New York, subjecting herself to the harsh local tabloids. Her victory was the first time a first lady was elected to public office. (Never mind that she hadn\u2019t been living in New York.) As the first woman with a real shot at the presidential nomination, Mrs. Clinton wasn\u2019t sure how to approach gender. In her 2008 campaign, she emphasized strength and experience, often at the expense of warmth. The Times\u2019s Mark Leibovich highlighted the few times she showed a softer side, as when she spoke at her friend Diane Blair\u2019s funeral in 2000. After Mrs. Clinton lost to Barack Obama, she surprised the nation again by accepting the position of secretary of state and diving into diplomatic work. Although her tenure is now marked by controversy over her email, in the period she served as the country\u2019s top diplomat, Mrs. Clinton enjoyed some of her highest approval ratings. Gallup consistently named her the country\u2019s most admired woman. The image was of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s facial features superimposed on a moon with the names of old Clinton friends, aides and hangers-on orbiting around her. It symbolized the challenges she would face as she considered another run for the presidency and how to organize the circle of people who hoped to tag along. As issues of race and criminal justice dominated the 2016 contest, little-known parts of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s biography began to form a central part of her campaign\u2019s story. Mrs. Clinton declined to be interviewed about the time in 1972 when she went undercover to investigate \u201csegregation academies\u201d in the South. But after an article about it ran, she and Bill Clinton talked openly about this chapter in her life, including at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia.",

But President Trump has been less sure-footed about how he would take on Senator Kamala Harris if she were to be his rival. And after her breakout performance in the Democratic presidential primary debate on Thursday night, Trump campaign aides and allies acknowledged that Ms. Harris, a black former prosecutor from the donor-laden state of California, could prove to be a vexing adversary. \u201cI would be more worried about Kamala Harris than Joe Biden as the nominee,\u201d Matt Schlapp, the chairman of the American Conservative Union, said after watching the debate. \u201cThe Joe Biden of last night is a candidate I would dream to run against.

She gave an audience of millions a preview of how she could be a nimble opponent in a televised face-off with Mr. Trump. And she chipped away at some of Mr. Biden\u2019s aura of dominance in the Democratic field. Many Republicans said even before Thursday\u2019s debate in Miami that Mr. Biden\u2019s presumed strengths were overstated \u2014 a sentiment the president shares. They described him as \u201cold\u201d and \u201ctired\u201d as well as someone they believed Mr. Trump knew how to spar with and rattle in a head-to-head contest. \u201cIf this is a window into how Biden would perform against Trump, it cannot give Democrats confidence,\u201d said Ralph Reed, the founder of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, who is in frequent contact with the White House. Mr. Reed\u2019s organization is one of a host of social conservative groups that will be spending tens of millions of dollars to identify and turn out voters for Mr. Trump in 2020. At a minimum, what some Republicans assumed would be a straightforward contest with Mr. Biden has suddenly become more unpredictable because of the Democratic debates. Ronna McDaniel, the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, said in an interview that Mr. Biden had fallen \u201cflat on his face.\u201d That, she said, pointed to a more protracted and contentious battle for the Democratic nomination than many Democrats \u2014 and Republicans \u2014 had hoped for. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to have one set front-runner throughout,\u201d Ms. McDaniel said. \u201cThere were two schools of thought. Is Biden going to carry the lead all the way to the end? Or are we going to have a lot of competitive candidates fighting this out?\u201d What became clear, she said, was that \u201cthere\u2019s the potential for many different candidates to take the lead.\u201d Privately, people close to the White House said they viewed Ms. Harris as \u201cvery dangerous\u201d and the hands-down winner of the debate on Thursday. Others said they hoped the debate would serve as a warning for Republicans \u2014 including those in the president\u2019s inner circle \u2014 who have been too dismissive of Mr. Biden\u2019s less seasoned rivals. Still, they said the debate did not change the fundamental assumption that campaign officials and allies of the president\u2019s have made about the dynamics of the race. And they cautioned that underestimating Mr. Biden\u2019s strength as a formidable force in the Democratic primary and as a serious threat to Mr. Trump in the general election would be a mistake. Until now, the Trump campaign and Republican Party strategists have lumped in Ms. Harris with the rest of the Democratic field, planning to pigeonhole her as a far-left radical in the mold of Mr. Sanders. They noted that like Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders, she raised her hand in the debate to signal support for abolishing private health insurance \u2014 an issue the Trump campaign expects to be the easiest way to explain what the Democratic version of \u201csocialism\u201d looks like. (On Friday morning, Ms. Harris walked back her position, saying she misunderstood the question and does not support abolishing private health insurance.) Trump aides and allies were equally pleased when she put Mr. Biden on his back foot, confronting him over his defense of Southern senators and support of antibusing policies decades ago. But even as they took pleasure in Mr. Biden\u2019s bad night, they conceded that her strong performance made it clear that Ms. Harris, too, could pose a real threat. Ms. Harris, who has demonstrated the natural political skills closer to those of President Barack Obama than those of Mrs. Clinton, would present Mr. Trump with an unfamiliar rival, and one whose race and gender are potential land mines for him in terms of his attacks. So far, he has struggled to land on a quick-hit way to undermine Ms. Harris\u2019s candidacy. Aides said that was because her poll numbers had not been high enough to register with him. After Ms. Harris\u2019s kickoff rally in January, he complimented her crowd size, describing it as \u201cthe best opening so far.\u201d In an interview with the Fox News host Sean Hannity, the president said that \u201cshe\u2019s got a little bit of a nasty wit.\u201d But Mr. Trump has focused most of his energy on Mr. Biden, whom internal polls have shown beating him in critical states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Ohio. Some Republicans would welcome a Trump-Harris race because it would allow them to frame the election exactly as they hope to: a battle of ideologies that will excite their conservative base with dire warnings of a socialist future. \u201cThis is a bit of a \u2018Braveheart\u2019 election, where everybody\u2019s painted their faces blue and they\u2019re all running at each other, and there\u2019s no quarter taken or given,\u201d Mr. Reed said. \u201cThe center is hollowed out. The unaffiliated voter has not disappeared but they\u2019re statistically insubstantial. So what you\u2019re looking for in that kind of election is a thing that increases intensity, enthusiasm and a feeling that something is really on the line.\u201d The effort to paint the Democratic Party in a radical light is expected to be well coordinated and led by a coalition of some of the biggest groups in Republican politics. \u201cThis lurch to the left and full throttled assault on the free enterprise system will be wrapped around the neck of the eventual Democratic nominee by the G.O.P.,\u201d said Scott W. Reed, the chief political strategist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. \u201cNo socialismo, no comunismo, somos capitalista,\u201d read a large banner hanging between two palm trees at a demonstration of Trump supporters on Wednesday outside the debate hall in Miami.",

      "author": "Michael R. Gordon",
      "content": "  Hillary Rodham Clinton was interviewed by Michael R. Gordon and Mark Landler on Thursday, her second-to-last day as secretary of state. Below are excerpts from the interview, which was conducted in her State Department office. Some of the questions have been edited for brevity. Q: President Clinton said that one of his greatest regrets was not doing more to stop genocide in Rwanda. We have a situation in Syria where more than 60,000 Syrians have been killed. [U.N. envoy Lakhdar] Brahimi has been making no headway diplomatically. The conflict is beginning to spread regionally with Iran\u2019s intervention with its Quds Forces, its arms supplies, Hezbollah\u2019s participation and now the Israeli strike on the convoy in Syria. Looking back, can you say that the United States has done everything it could have to stem the killing in Syria? And when you look back on this episode in the book you are going to write, do you think that you might regret that the United States wasn\u2019t able to do more in your years here? A: I think those are two separate questions, Michael. I think that certainly there will always be regrets when you are in positions like this one when it comes to the horrific slaughter of people trying to express themselves and defend themselves by a government that seems to have lost all sense of responsibility toward their own population. That is definitely a terrible set of facts on the ground that we try to deal with every single day. However, when you look at it as we have, the United States has been very active. We have worked assiduously, first to create some kind of legitimate opposition presence that we would then serve as the vehicle by which we conducted negotiations and tired to use that to push [President Bashir al-]Assad over the edge of legitimacy. That turned out to be much harder than it should have. Unlike Libya, where we had a Transitional National Council, despite all of their many difficulties there was an address. There were people I met with. I met them. I looked them in the eye. I was able to go back and say to the president, \u201cThese are people you can count on, you can bet on and we need to help them.\u201d For the first year, unfortunately, the people who were trying to represent the opposition outside Syria just couldn\u2019t gain traction or credibility, and it made it difficult not only for the United States but many other countries to really do what we had hoped we could do. But we never stopped trying, and we now have a new opposition coalition largely established because of our intensive efforts, my personal efforts, Robert Ford and our team. And yesterday for the very first time [Syria\u2019s top opposition leader Moaz] al-Khatib came out and said, O.K., under certain conditions we can actually begin a political dialogue with this regime. That took a long time to get to, unfortunately nearly two years. Secondly, we have been very active in training and equipping, with nonlethal tools, a lot of Syrian oppositionists who would come out of Syria and go back in. And we think it has made a difference in their ability to coalesce and organize. Thirdly, we have been the architect and main mover of the very tough sanctions against Assad, which we know are causing problems because Iran has limited ability at this point to replace everything they don\u2019t have, like diesel fuel. So we think that\u2019s making a difference. And finally on the humanitarian front, we are the most generous donor. It has been very difficult to get the aid and the money into exactly where it is needed. We have gotten a lot better about that. And we have worked also with our neighbors in the region. Having said all that, Assad is still killing. The opposition is increasingly being represented by Al Qaeda extremist elements, including representatives of Al Qaeda in Iraq and Al Qaeda in the Maghreb and Al Qaeda, you know, messages coming, we believe, from the FATA [Federally Administered Tribal Areas, a semi-autonomous region in northwestern Pakistan], which is deeply distressing and unfortunately adds to the narrative with the Assad regime. Now along those lines, I have spent enormous amounts of time and capital working with first Kofi Annan and now Brahimi. They are both very capable diplomats. They each have a lot of successes behind their names. The role that Russia has played cannot be understated in terms of preventing the kind of action that should have been taken in the Security Council. So I worked with [the initial U.N. envoy on Syria] Kofi Annan. We convened the meeting in Geneva. I personally, literally, wrote and negotiated the accord for the action group. We had every reason when we left there to believe that the Russians were finally going to do something. They wanted airtight language against military intervention, but they were willing to throw in on the political transition. A new executive authority would have to be established. And there were willing to even tighten sanctions on individuals and institutions. We leave Geneva. We go back to the U.N. And all of a sudden, whether it is because they exceeded their brief in Geneva or they had a change of mind, put on the brakes again. So it has been an ongoing effort to put together, inside and outside of the U.N., enough of an international coalition to actually take some action, and we\u2019re still working toward that. Q: If one looks back at how the Clinton administration handled the Kosovo crisis, it became clear that Russia would not support a new Security Council resolution authorizing intervention to protect the Kosovars. So the United States elected not to seek a new resolution and instead justified intervention on the basis of international law. Why have you and the Obama administration taken the position that a stronger stance on Syria requires a new Security Council resolution, which means the formal endorsement of the Russian government, when that has always appeared to be a highly unlikely proposition? A: Well, I think that first of all Kosovo, despite the brutality and the horrors of what was happening in the Balkans, was immensely simple in lots of ways than what we\u2019re talking about in Syria. And the approach that the Clinton administration was thinking about was much more focused and possible than the difficulties, the borders and the hostilities taking place in Syria allow. Secondly, the potential of getting NATO support right now is quite challenging, if not impossible. And that\u2019s not a comment on NATO, because NATO did Libya and we did this unprecedented partnership with Arab countries and the Arab League. But there is not the same level of willingness within NATO to do something like that again right now. I think that you can debate whether that should or shouldn\u2019t be, but I think that\u2019s a fair description. So part of what the United States really has attempted to do in this situation is what we were able to do in Libya. Because for many nations now, even those in NATO, they don\u2019t feel comfortable moving forward without some kind of internationally legally recognized basis for action. So times are difficult. I think that Kosovo was different and the times are different. And we also are well aware that Russia is an actor in Syria. Russia has a naval base. It attempts to continue supplying weapons to Assad. It has demonstrated its willingness to perhaps do even more to help Assad. So it is not a passive opposition. It is an active one with potential consequences that has to factored in. Q: On Burma, we have learned that you and your team overcame a certain amount of resistance internally, from the Pentagon on security grounds, from human rights officials, that doing any deal with the generals was unacceptable, and were able to make the case for a diplomatic opening. I am wondering how you made that case. It was described to me as you doing a little bit of an end run and going straight to the president. A: Well, first of all I believed strongly when I came in that there were some places that we had to test with respect to changing our relationship with them and seeing if we could find ways to incentivize change from within. So in the very early days I made a decision that we wanted to test Burma. And we started sending diplomats there to meet with officials across the board \u2014 N.L.D. [National League for Democracy, a Burmese political party] representatives, generals who would meet with our people, obviously Aung San Suu Kyi in very limited circumstances and Kurt [Campbell, the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs] was the point person for me on sending these diplomats out, evaluating their reports and then finally I sent him, which was the highest profile visit we had made to Burma in quite some time. He came back after a very full set of meetings, including with Aung San Suu Kyi, and said, \u201cYou know, I just feel it. I feel like there is movement here and that we can help push it. And we need to have a formal process at the same time looking at our Burma policy.\u201d Because I was well aware, as you just said, a lot of people have a very black-and-white view of these situations: why would we engage, why would I send anybody there? So I did a couple of things. I knew that there were some very strong supporters of Aung San Suu Kyi and of sanctions on Burma in the Senate led by Mitch McConnell, who could scuttle a lot of what I might try to do. I went to see him and I said: \u201cThis is off the record, this is just me talking to you, Mitch. I want to tell you that I am trying to put together an effort to test what is happening in Burma.\u201d He said, \u2018I don\u2019t think that will work.\u201d I said, \u201cIt may or may not work, but what I want to know if you will support us trying.\u201d We talked and he finally said, \u201cNothing else has worked. You might as well.\u201d And on the way out of the office, he stopped, and right before you get to the door of his inner office there is a handwritten letter from Aung San Suu Kyi to him, thanking him for all the support he has given her over the years. So once I had kind of enough evidence and had developed this plan I said to the White House, \u201cI think we need to test this and take some chances here.\u201d And again, you know, debate, debate, debate was happening. Eventually, I needed to do something very dramatic to demonstrate we were going to do this opening. So I should go. I talked to the president and I said, \u201cI think this is real. I think we need to test it.\u201d And the only way for me to feel comfortable advising you on this is to go. So he was supportive of my going. So we did the announcement that I was going to go, and I went. I was very careful to pay a lot of attention, and spend a lot of time with, the generals. Because I had during the process of thinking this through had some great conversations with the Indonesians. Because [the Indonesian president, Bambang] Yudhoyono had been telling me \u201cI think, Burma is going to change.\u201d And he personally had invested a lot in working with the generals. Because he had been a general, taken off the uniform and was a democratically elected president. There still is a long way to go for Burma\u2019s democracy. Q: What was President Obama\u2019s attitude on this? When I went, we had no idea what was going to happen. The president basically said, \u201cLook, I\u2019m behind you on this.\u201d He had people in the White House who were very worried, even negative. \u201cYou\u2019re rewarding them. They haven\u2019t done enough.\u201d We dealt with all of that. So it was really between the president and me, and he trusted me and he said, \u201cLets see what happens.\u201d There was no discussion about him going, until I go. And what I told the Burmese, \u201cWe\u2019re going to action for action.\u201d You release political prisoners, that we believe is authentic, we send an ambassador. You do economic reforms, we lift sanctions. It was just an action for action agenda. And slowly we saw [Burma\u2019s president] Thein Sein and his close advisers moving in that direction. Q: As you leave office, you now have China and Japan increasingly at odds over the Senkaku Islands. There are other territorial disputes over islands in this region. A lot of foreign policy analysts mention this part of the world as a potential flashpoint. Do you think the South China Sea is an example of the limits of the United States influence? Or do you think you can make the case that that you have actually influenced China\u2019s behavior? I would make the case that we have influenced the behavior of the nations in the region, in a way that has pulled them together, particularly through Asean [the Association of Southeast Asian Nations] to seek a code of conduct, which had been promised but not delivered in years past. In the last two years, there\u2019s been a move toward a rules-based framework that should be used to resolve these disputes. Now having said that, it\u2019s going to be very difficult. Q. But what about China\u2019s behavior itself? Do you see any change in their behavior? I think it has served a very important purpose of helping to create a broader recognition of Chinese behavior that predated our saying anything, but which had led to real anxiety. We keep saying that we want China to be a responsible stakeholder in a rules-based global order. And being a responsible stakeholder means that you have to present your claims if you can\u2019t resolve it between you and the other claimant or you have to negotiate a fair, acceptable compromise. I think there has been some movement on that with respect to some of the nations. There\u2019s still going to be belligerence, and there\u2019s going to be a lot of very hot rhetoric, and there\u2019s going to be a flotilla of Chinese vessels in the region. But I think we\u2019ve helped support a strong case of the kind of framework that we believe in. Q: During the negotiations over Chen Guangcheng [the blind Chinese dissident] the talks became very difficult. Some officials thought it might not be salvageable. What made you think you could resolve this? I believed we were going to figure out a way through this. Because I knew that the Chinese leadership and our leadership both valued the investments that we all had made, not only in the strategic and economic dialogue, but in creating a more durable framework for our relationship. It was a very, very tough set of negotiations. And I was pulled into it, as I recall, on Wednesday night when we thought we had a deal. And then Mr. Chen decided that he did not like the deal we had negotiated, which, you know, caused a great deal of anxiety on the part of our team and we had to had to go back and renegotiate, which the Chinese were understandably quite unhappy about. And so there was a lot of drama. And I believed I would eventually have to get into it, but we would have to let a lot of the steam off. [On Thursday], I had a lunch that include the main negotiators for the Chinese side and then I went to a large event on our people-to-people relationships. There were two incredible, attractive young people, one Chinese and one American, and they stood up and spoke about how important this relationship was and how valuable their experiences had been. Most of the main players on the Chinese side were there. It was a moment when I looked at all of them, and I know they\u2019re thinking: \u201cWe don\u2019t want this all to break up over this guy. What are we going to do?\u201d I could just see it. The next morning we had a pre-existing event with American and Chinese business people, and we were back in one of the big beautiful all-glass pavilions. And I sent a note to Dai [China foreign policy official Dai Bingguo] saying, \u201cYou and I have got to talk.\u201d I made what I knew would be the kind of final argument about why, but we couldn\u2019t risk seeing our relationship founder over this. We would never agree on what happened and why, but we had to resolve it. So then Dai gave the go-ahead for his side to negotiate with ours again and we got an agreement. It was incredibly intense, but I was always confident.",

      "author": "Maggie Haberman",
      "content": " HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON was feeling good. Rick A. Lazio, her Republican opponent in the race for senator from New York, had appeared, to some, overly aggressive in their debate the night before. Walking out of a Buffalo diner on the morning of Sept. 14, 2000, she headed over to a crowd of people in the parking lot, cordoned off by police tape, who were waiting to meet her. A woman asked, in a measured voice, about improving schools. Mrs. Clinton responded with something benign, and the woman\u2019s expression suddenly became a sneer. The questioner\u2019s response could not be fully heard from where I stood. But Mrs. Clinton\u2019s face fell. She looked wounded. It was eye-opening for me as a reporter covering her campaign for The New York Post: As first lady, Mrs. Clinton and her husband had endured nearly eight years of scalding attacks by congressional Republicans. Yet a random voter could still get to her emotionally. By that point, she was entering the final stages of a 16-month, often bumpy campaign for the Senate representing New York, a state where she had never lived. She had let go of much of the choreography and inhibition that had once kept her insulated from voters (even if she still spoke to them across a barrier). She was complicated, a policy wonk \u2014 she often talked excitedly about the human genome project \u2014 and prone to candor at unexpected moments. She could come across as brittle, as rehearsed. But more often than people realized, her emotions were in plain view. And though running for office required her to let her guard down, something that had not come easily to her over the years, she adjusted. She even seemed to like being on the trail. By the time votes were cast, she had become an adept campaigner. Seven years later, Mrs. Clinton showed the same delayed liftoff in her first run for the White House. Laden with baggage and prone to self-inflicted wounds, she needs a long runway. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s 2000 race gave her a chance to relate to people on her own terms, perhaps for the first time in her public life. It took about a year, but she broke through the suffocating bubble of being a first lady. She has a different kind of enclosure to step out of this year: the lifestyle of a wealthy woman who, after four years shielded from politics as secretary of state, earned giant speaking fees that, her detractors argue, undercut her credibility as a voice for middle-class Americans. And she is only now emerging from a defensive crouch after squandering months answering questions about her email practices while at the State Department. Her kickoff road trip to Iowa in April called to mind so much of the 2000 campaign, when she outworked her rivals, barnstorming upstate in a bus and lingering at rope lines until there were no more hands to shake. The Iowa jaunt seemed like shock therapy for a candidate eager to find her comfort zone again. Back in July 1999, when she announced her exploratory committee outside Albany, the moment could not have been less spontaneous. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, whose seat Mrs. Clinton was eyeing, guided her around his farm, his arm perfectly crooked, her smile frozen wide. So began Mrs. Clinton\u2019s so-called listening tour, intended to remove the carpetbagger label that had stuck to her. She took questions earnestly from dozens of voters, but she also droned on for long stretches. Local Democrats quietly asked her to hold smaller events, with more back-and-forth. But first, Mrs. Clinton went house hunting, an occasion that set a new bar for pseudo-intimacy. For hours, a caravan of reporters rode with the Clintons and the Secret Service from fancy house to fancier house, with White House aides telling us where we had just been only after we had left. When Mrs. Clinton was unguarded, her lapses could leave her dealing with the aftermath for days. Her aides forgot to tip a waitress, and she was hammered in the tabloids (especially mine), waiting several days to apologize. She nodded as if agreeing when Yasir Arafat\u2019s wife accused Israelis of poisoning Palestinian children. Again, she dug in before explaining herself. Yet by the summer of 2000, something had changed. She was adjusting. And she seemed happier outside New York City: She seemed to connect most with people in the suburbs and in upstate towns, where voters were thrilled by the attention. Mrs. Clinton also benefited, as she sometimes has, from opponents who underwhelmed \u2014 and from a news corps that overreached. Rudolph W. Giuliani, the New York mayor, barely left the metropolitan area before pulling out of the race. And Mr. Lazio began his campaign by falling flat on his face at a parade. He split his lip. In the fall, a Daily News front page accused Mrs. Clinton of accepting money from an anti-Israel group of Muslims. I never saw her angrier. \u201cWe have 13 days left in this election,\u201d she said. \u201cFasten your seatbelts. This is just the beginning. You have no idea what\u2019s going to be thrown at me. It\u2019s going to be everything, including the kitchen sink.\u201d It helped that she was perceived as being unfairly attacked \u2014 a situation she has repeatedly turned to her advantage. I had never covered a major race before. But it was striking that Mrs. Clinton, who distrusted reporters in the abstract, could be kind, curious and even playful with those who spent the most time with her. It seemed to mean something to her that we logged the same hours she did far from home. She had little use for some but would call others for off-the-record conversations, to wish them a happy birthday or even to apologize if she felt she had been churlish. She caused one reporter to blush by alluding to his noticeable flirtation with a competitor the night before, and she occasionally let us know that her aides had passed along the jokes they heard us tell. Trapped in her fishbowl, Mrs. Clinton seemed to get a little charge from the rest of us. So far this year, there have been only fleeting glimpses of the level of comfort she showed on the campaign trail then. Even at her best, near the end of the 2000 race, she could still be clunky. At a senior center in Queens, I remember grimaces across the room when she spoke about a Holocaust survivor \u201ckah-velling\u201d about his grandchildren, mangling the Yiddish word for gushing. But it didn\u2019t matter. She was enjoying herself by then.",

      "subtitle": "A Touchy-Feely Approach From Hillary ClintonIn her first ad of the general campaign, Mrs. Clinton highlights lesser-known aspects of her work on behalf of families and children.By Nick CorasanitiPRINT EDITIONTouchy-Feely Approach From Hillary Clinton|June 19, 2016, Page A16",
      "author": "Nick Corasaniti",
      "content": " Just days after the massacre at a gay nightclub in Orlando, and after a long primary campaign in which Republican candidates often seemed preoccupied with war, terrorism and related fears, Hillary Clinton\u2019s first ad of the general election strikes a gentler and more reassuring tone. It seeks to reintroduce her to voters, ostensibly by highlighting lesser-known aspects of her work on behalf of families and children. THE MESSAGE Titled \u201cAlways,\u201d the minute-long commercial begins with home movie footage of Mrs. Clinton as a toddler, teetering down steps with a grown-up\u2019s help and waving to the camera with a toothy smile. \u201cShe would grow up to be one of the most recognizable women in the world,\u201d a male narrator says, over now-familiar pictures of Mrs. Clinton, some alongside her husband. \u201cBut less well-known are the causes that have been at the center of her life.\u201d The ad cites her work \u201chelping get disabled kids out of the shadows and into their local schools\u201d; bringing \u201creform to some of the poorest schools in the nation\u201d; working \u201cwith Republicans and Democrats\u201d to enact the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, which \u201ctoday is covering eight million kids\u201d; and, as secretary of state, \u201cworking to end the trafficking of women and girls.\u201d Acknowledging, ever so wispily, that \u201cthrough the years there have been challenges, setbacks,\u201d the ad says one thing has never changed: \u201cHelping children has been a cause of her life, and it always will be.\u201d THE IMPACT The ad is one of three Mrs. Clinton began running on Thursday in Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio and Virginia. She is following the playbook that President Obama used in 2012, trying to define herself and, with speeches attacking Donald J. Trump, define her opponent too, even before they each officially claim their nominations. THE TAKEAWAY What is said is important, like the reference to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s bipartisan work in Washington, a strong signal as she goes up against the my-way-or-the-highway Republican candidate, Mr. Trump. But what is shown is what matters most: Photos and video clips serve to humanize Mrs. Clinton as a motherly figure, hugging young people, crouching down with little children; as a protector, standing alongside military officers; and as a hard worker, toting piles of law books, speaking out, or descending from a government plane alone in the middle of the night. Changing channels \u2026 Mr. Trump\u2019s more insulting remarks about women have proved irresistible satire fodder for his Republican opponents and for Priorities USA, the Democratic \u201csuper PAC\u201d allied with Mrs. Clinton. Now, Florida Democrats are giving it a try, but with a new, \u201cHappy Days\u201d aesthetic. The group has made four different ads, with sepia-tone titles, faux film flicker, and a singsong narrator who would sound at home on a furniture-size tube television in the Eisenhower administration. Each offers a different \u201cFather\u2019s Day tip\u201d culled from Mr. Trump\u2019s utterances. No. 4: \u201cBe as uninvolved with your children as possible!\u201d Of all the insults hurled at Mr. Trump, one seemed to get under his skin the most: Senator Marco Rubio\u2019s suggestion that his hands were unusually small. Mr. Trump\u2019s response spawned a thousand memes, and now even a super PAC: \u201cAmericans Against Insecure Billionaires with Tiny Hands.\u201d While joke political groups routinely file paperwork with the Federal Election Commission, this one actually cut and broadcast a 60-second ad in Washington, D.C., with actors demanding the release of Mr. Trump\u2019s hand measurements, as a doll-size hand is shown struggling to manage everyday tasks \u2014 like pushing the nuclear button. 43: Days since the Trump campaign ran its last television ad. $17 MILLION: Amount spent by Priorities USA on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s behalf in the same time period. $8.5 MILLION: Amount spent by Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign in four days this week.",

      "author": "The New York Times",
      "content": " Hillary Rodham Clinton, a former secretary of state, has been most outspoken in recent years on foreign policy matters. But she has also taken positions on domestic and economic issues, like immigration and income inequality, that have been at the center of policy discussions since she left government. Here is a look at where she stands on some major issues. Mrs. Clinton has long advocated a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians. She declined to comment on the recent Israeli election, even as many Republicans came out in support of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. She calls herself \u201can emphatic, unwavering supporter of Israel\u2019s safety and security.\u201d Regarding the Islamic State, Mrs. Clinton has said the failure to help some of the more moderate rebels during the Syrian uprising led to a power vacuum that set the stage for the rise of Islamic militancy. Like most leading Democrats, Mrs. Clinton has called for government action to fight climate change, saying, \u201cThe science of climate change is unforgiving, no matter what the deniers may say; sea levels are rising, ice caps are melting, storms, droughts and wildfires are wreaking havoc.\u201d She has supported cap and trade, under which companies can trade carbon credits to reduce harmful emissions. She supports President Obama\u2019s decision to use his executive powers to reshape the nation\u2019s immigration policy, saying it was needed \u201cto begin fixing our broken immigration system and focus finite resources on deporting felons rather than families.\u201d Mrs. Clinton has yet to outline her economic strategy, but people close to her say she is expected to support raising the minimum wage, closing corporate tax loopholes, cutting taxes for the middle class and investing in infrastructure. She supports the 2010 Dodd-Frank law toughening regulation of financial institutions, but has come under criticism for her family\u2019s close ties to the financial sector, including highly paid speeches to Wall Street banks.",

      "author": "Matt Stevens",
      "content": " Hours after Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, broke his silence and said that Russia had sought to damage Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign, Mrs. Clinton said that the \u201csystemic efforts to interfere\u201d in the 2016 election \u201cdeserves the attention of every American.\u201d Mrs. Clinton made the remarks as part of a commencement address on Wednesday afternoon to more than 2,400 Hunter College students inside New York City\u2019s Madison Square Garden. Amid a sea of purple caps and gowns, she also leveled fresh criticism at the Trump administration for what she said was its \u201ccomplete refusal to condemn a foreign power who attacked our democracy\u201d and its failure to protect the country\u2019s voting systems against future attacks. \u201cIt seems absolutely clear that we\u2019ve got to deal with what has been investigated and reported,\u201d she said. Earlier in the day, Mr. Mueller held a 10-minute news conference \u2014 his first public characterization of the investigation since it began more than two years ago \u2014 in which he discussed central elements of his report, including the decision to not explicitly clear President Trump of obstruction of justice. He reiterated allegations previously laid out in an indictment that Russian intelligence officers had \u201cused sophisticated cybertechniques to hack into computers and networks used by the Clinton campaign,\u201d and that their release of that information was \u201cdesigned and timed to interfere with our election\u201d and to \u201cdamage\u201d Mrs. Clinton. Mrs. Clinton also used part of her 30-minute commencement speech to criticize what she called \u201cthe big social media platforms,\u201d which she said \u201cknow their systems are being manipulated by foreign and domestic actors to sow division, promote extremism and spread misinformation.\u201d \u201cBut they won\u2019t get serious about cleaning up their platforms unless consumers demand it,\u201d she told the graduates. She specifically rebuked Facebook for its refusal to remove altered videos of Speaker Nancy Pelosi, which first appeared online last week and spread widely. In one of the edited videos, Ms. Pelosi\u2019s speech was slowed down and slurred, making her appear drunk. Ms. Pelosi herself sharply criticized Facebook earlier on Wednesday, telling a public radio station in Northern California that the company\u2019s refusal to take down altered videos of her demonstrated how the social network contributed to misinformation. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t even a close call,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said of Facebook\u2019s decision not to remove the content. \u201cThe video is sexist trash.\u201d Mrs. Clinton\u2019s comments come four weeks after she sharply criticized Attorney General William P. Barr, President Trump, members of the Republican Party and some findings of the Mueller report in a wide-ranging interview on \u201cThe Rachel Maddow Show.\u201d She has also recently appeared in a comedy sketch in which she performed a dramatic reading of the Mueller report, and has spoken out on Twitter about the recent state abortion bans. On Wednesday, she continued to obliquely attack the Trump administration, saying, \u201cWe are witnessing an assault on the rule of law and the foundations of our democracy,\u201d and that democracy \u201cfeels far from secure.\u201d But she sought to keep the mood mostly uplifting and occasionally light. Mrs. Clinton opened her remarks by thanking the Hunter College president, Jennifer J. Raab. \u201cMadam President \u2014 that has a nice ring to it,\u201d she said, to laughs and cheers. Then she mentioned that last year\u2019s commencement speaker was the actor Vin Diesel. \u201cWe\u2019re going to star in a movie together,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s called \u2018The Fast and the Still Really Furious.\u2019\u201d",

But with big names like the Clintons and Obamas remaining silent, the party lacks anyone to sort it out.By Reid J. EpsteinPRINT EDITIONParty Without Leader,  And a Primary Lineup With Too Many Names|July 5, 2019, Page A12",
      "author": "Reid J. Epstein",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 John Deeth is the sort of Iowa activist who keeps up with every new twist in the Democratic presidential primary, but there was no way he was going to devote two evenings to watching the first round of debates last week. Instead Mr. Deeth, a 55-year-old from Iowa City who has volunteered for every Democratic caucus since 1992, spent one debate night watching \u201cGoodfellas\u201d and the other at the grocery store. \u201cUntil this field is narrowed down to serious people, I\u2019m not going to spend four hours watching them,\u201d Mr. Deeth said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to suffer through Andrew Yang.\u201d Mr. Deeth\u2019s frustration highlights a central challenge the Democratic Party faces as it tries to identify the strongest candidate to take on President Trump: The slate of 24 contenders is too unwieldy for a constructive debate, many activists and strategists say, and too large for most voters to follow. And with a leadership vacuum at the top of the party, there is no one to elevate candidates with an endorsement, or help steer third-tier candidates out of the race when they\u2019ve reached their plausible expiration date. [Which Democrats are leading the 2020 presidential race this week?] Former President Barack Obama, an influential voice among many Democrats, is sitting out the primary. The Clintons, a once-dominant party presence, are largely unwelcome this time around. In Washington, Speaker Nancy Pelosi is focused on keeping the House in order, and Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, has failed to recruit  presidential candidates like Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana and former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas into potentially winnable Senate races. The only kingmaker willing to crown candidates so far has been Oprah Winfrey. The media mogul did a glowing interview with Mr. O\u2019Rourke when the Texan was at the near-peak of his popularity in February. Since then she has moved on to Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., telling  the Hollywood Reporter that she instructed the director Steven Spielberg to \u201clook him up.\u201d (She hasn\u2019t yet touted Marianne Williamson, her onetime spiritual adviser.) Of the party\u2019s living former presidential nominees, just Walter Mondale and Michael Dukakis have weighed in on the race. Mr. Mondale endorsed a fellow Minnesotan, Senator Amy Klobuchar, and Mr. Dukakis backed Senator Elizabeth Warren, who like him hails from Massachusetts. The rest are keeping their distance from the messy primary, which post-debate polling shows has bifurcated between a top tier of five candidates and everyone else vying just to qualify for the party\u2019s fall debates. Only Mr. Obama has the stature within the party to influence the primary scramble, former Gov. Ed Rendell of Pennsylvania said. \u201cIf Barack Obama stood up and said, \u2018You other Democrats, stop going after Joe Biden for his record from 30 years ago, I knew all this stuff and I picked him to be vice president of the United States,\u2019 that might do it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think the president feels it would be right for him.\u201d [Sign up for our politics newsletter and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race.] Mr. Obama has held private conversations with most of the Democrats running and speaks regularly with former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. He is not likely to engage in a public way until late in the primary process. The Clintons\u2019 connection to the primary is more complicated. Former President Bill Clinton, his legacy tarnished by sexual indiscretions and allegations of sexual assault (which he denies), is persona non grata on the campaign trail in the #MeToo era. Hillary Clinton is still popular with many Democrats, including women, but her Electoral College loss to Mr. Trump limits her influence over party politics and on shaping the 2020 Democratic field; she has met or talked with several of the candidates, but they generally do not see her as someone who could call shots in the race. Former Senator Barbara Boxer of California said the calls to cull the field are a symptom of tension between a right-now society and a nominating process designed to take 18 months or more. \u201cEverybody wants instant answers,\u201d Ms. Boxer said. \u201cWho is going to be left, who is going to win. We don\u2019t know any of that. If you\u2019re getting squeezed out of the debates, do something fabulous and figure it out to get attention.\u201d The debate format itself, created by the Democratic National Committee, has added to the sprawling nature of the primary. The relatively low thresholds for the first two debates have provided an incentive for low-polling candidates to stay in at least through the end of July. [Here Are the Democrats at Risk of Not Making the July Debates] While NBC\u2019s high ratings for the first set of debates suggest high interest in the presidential campaign, party leaders in early voting states like Iowa \u2014 which have had the most exposure to the 24 Democrats in the race \u2014 say the oversaturation is counterproductive. \u201cTen of them should drop out now,\u201d said Claire Celsi, an Iowa state senator. \u201cIt\u2019s not really fair to the other people. The debates are just unmanageable.\u201d After last week\u2019s debates, Ms. Celsi posted to Facebook a list of 10 Democratic candidates who she said should consider dropping out. Of Ms. Williamson, Ms. Celsi wrote, \u201cLove can\u2019t pay the bills.\u201d And she said Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado suffers from \u201cwhite guy can be president if he wants syndrome.\u201d [Justin Amash, the only Republican in Congress to call for impeaching President Trump, is leaving the party.] Other Democrats rebutted the idea that candidates should be persuaded to end their campaigns. Deval Patrick, the former Massachusetts governor who considered a 2020 presidential run, said the decision to drop out can only belong to the candidate. \u201cIn a successful democracy, the candidate or the voters, and only they, should determine when it\u2019s appropriate for a candidate to drop out,\u201d Mr. Patrick said. The field, he said, \u201cis not too big.\u201d Veterans of the bitter 2016 primary between Mrs. Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont recall Mr. Sanders\u2019s complaints that the Democratic machinery was rigged against him, and wince at the possibility that claims of favoritism or disputes over viability could again prove divisive. For that crowd, the party\u2019s debate thresholds \u2014 due to rise to 130,000 unique donors and 2 percent in at least four polls by September, double the requirements for the first two debates \u2014 is a recipe for producing grievances from candidates who don\u2019t qualify. \u201cIt is crazy dangerous for the D.N.C. to take on the role of limiting the field,\u201d said Jennifer Palmieri, who was communications director for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign. \u201cEven if you have good intentions, the unintended consequences of that could be pretty devastating.\u201d Donna Brazile, who became chairwoman of the D.N.C. after revelations that her predecessor, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, had favored Mrs. Clinton, said people should remind themselves the second-tier candidates won\u2019t be around much longer. \u201cThe biggest part is going to be dominated by the top four or the top two,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like the N.F.L., we don\u2019t complain about the number of teams we see during the season, we want to know who has the best players to get to the playoffs.\u201d The Democratic Party chairman, Tom Perez, said he considered the debates a roaring success, marked by high TV ratings and a focus on policy issues, while avoiding the attack-driven fireworks that characterized the 2016 Republican debates. The D.N.C. has been squeezed between those who think there are too many candidates and others who say the more stringent criteria for future debates is too limiting. Mr. Perez has said over and over again that the party\u2019s rules have been set for months and that he is not going to change them. \u201cYou can\u2019t set rules and then make new rules that would violate our commitment to fairness, transparency and consistency,\u201d Mr. Perez said. \u201cWe explained all of the rules to the candidates back in February. Everybody nodded, understood and agreed.\u201d All three 2020 candidates Mr. Schumer failed to convince to run for the Senate are now mired among the race\u2019s also-rans. Former Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado purged his top campaign staff this week. Mr. O\u2019Rourke registered less than 1 percent in the latest Suffolk University poll of Iowa Democrats. Mr. Bullock, the Montana governor, didn\u2019t even qualify for the first round of debates. For any candidate who is considering leaving the race, the comedian Samantha Bee offered a prominent platform: her late-night show on TBS. She invited candidates to announce they are leaving the race on her show, and promised to throw them a dropout party with balloons, music and a cake of the candidate\u2019s choosing.",

      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 Democrats still don\u2019t agree on why they lost the White House in 2016. But they have absolutely no intention of repeating their mistakes. Whatever they were, exactly. Was it the loss of working-class white voters or urban black voters? Too much talk of Donald J. Trump or not enough? And what about those Russians? If Hillary Clinton\u2019s decision to skip campaigning in Wisconsin was a problem, the party has that one covered. Democrats selected Milwaukee as the site of their national convention a year from now. In Michigan and Pennsylvania, states where Hillary Clinton lost after polling ahead for months, Democratic candidates pop up at coffee shops and farmers\u2019 markets, field questions from audiences in packed high school auditoriums and clog up cellphone voice mail boxes. \u201cYou\u2019re making me confess to a secret,\u201d said Representative Mark Pocan of Wisconsin, a liberal who represents the area around Madison. He explained that his voice mail was full and no one could leave new messages. It\u2019s been that way since the beginning of the year, and he said has no plans to clear it out. \u201cThat way I don\u2019t have to deal with the candidates,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a few calling, obviously.\u201d [Sign up for our politics newsletter and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race.] From former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who kicked off his 2020 campaign in a Pittsburgh union hall, to Senator Kirsten Gillibrand\u2019s effort to energize her campaign with a Rust Belt bus tour last week, the presidential candidates are eager to show Democratic voters, officials and activists that they\u2019re fighting the next war \u2014 by way of the last one. Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania have become an electoral Bermuda triangle for Democrats, with a pull so strong that they\u2019re frequently mentioned at campaign events in Iowa and New Hampshire, where voters will set the course for the 2020 primary race. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to put someone at the top of the ticket who can win in places like Iowa and Wisconsin and Michigan and Pennsylvania, right? We all know that,\u201d Senator Amy Klobuchar told voters during a Saturday campaign stop in Waterloo, Iowa. Two days later Mr. Biden said his candidacy relies on winning the same set of states. \u201cI\u2019m accustomed to winning places like Pennsylvania and Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin,\u201d he told 200 people gathered on the driveway at the home of former Gov. Tom Vilsack of Iowa. \u201cThere\u2019s no way a Democrat can get elected president without winning Pennsylvania, you just can\u2019t do it.\u201d The Rust Belt bus tours and campaign cattle calls are far more about lingering post-traumatic stress from the Democrats\u2019 2016 loss than any current electoral strategy. While the traditionally blue states are likely to be crucial to Democrats in a general election, none of the three are scheduled to hold their primary vote before Super Tuesday, the dozen-state primary that\u2019s widely expected to winnow the field in early March. Of course, the 2020 race bears little resemblance to the last race \u2014 or any other primary in modern electoral history. The crowded Democratic field is four times as big as it was at its largest point in 2016, historically diverse and features the widest age gap ever seen in a primary contest. Democrats may have new opportunities in states where demographics are shifting like Georgia, Arizona and Texas. And the nominee will face a sitting president, who has shown some eagerness to intervene in the opposing party primary contest. [President Trump\u2019s re-election strategy involves stoking cultural and racial resentments, just as he did in 2016.] The field of 2020 candidates is eager to reassure voters that if they win, they won\u2019t take anything for granted, even as they handle the previous Democratic nominee with extreme care. Earlier this year, Ms. Klobuchar quickly called Mrs. Clinton to apologize, after she launched her bid with promises to win in Wisconsin that were seen as a jab at the former Secretary of State. Still, the implicit critique rings clear to Democratic voters and donors. \u201cI was one of Hillary Clinton\u2019s finance chairs and unfortunately she didn\u2019t come into Michigan enough. They\u2019re not ignoring us now,\u201d said Barry Goodman, a Democratic donor in the Detroit suburbs who is raising money for Mr. Biden. In town hall meetings and diner meet-and-greets, Democrats frequently bring up the 2016 defeat, often as an origin story for how they became more engaged in national politics. \u201cPeople continue to come up to me to tell me the story of where they were on the evening of Nov. 8, 2016, how it impacted them, how they\u2019ve since become engaged,\u201d said Representative Chrissy Houlahan, a freshman from the Philadelphia suburbs who\u2019s being wooed by multiple presidential candidates for an endorsement. \u201cIt\u2019s seared in the collective memory.\u201d For others, the shock of that loss transformed them into cable news pundits, eager to project what white Rust Belt voters may \u2014 or may not \u2014 want in a candidate over what they personally might prefer. \u201cWe have created an electorate full of pundits and strategists, and the result is that we\u2019re puzzling through not who we like but who we imagine someone else will like,\u201d said Senator Brian Schatz, Democrat of Hawaii. \u201cIt\u2019s a fool\u2019s errand to imagine who will be appealing to someone else.\u201d The armchair punditry is only exacerbated by a steady drumbeat of polling on the race. After a period of soul searching, pollsters are once again up and running. A 2017 report by the American Association for Public Opinion Research, an industry group, recommended some changes to polling, notably improving accounting for voters\u2019 education levels, surveying people closer to Election Day and pressing those who say they are undecided on which way they might be leaning. But mostly, the report blamed the \u201clarge, problematic errors\u201d in state polls on a single culprit: Money. \u201cIt is a persistent frustration within polling and the larger survey research community that the profession is judged based on how these often under-budgeted state polls perform relative to the election outcome,\u201d the report noted. But Charles Franklin, the director of the Marquette Law School poll in Milwaukee, who helped craft the report, says while it identified some problems and suggested solutions, none were a \u201cmagic bullet.\u201d He\u2019s back in business for the 2020 election, with some tweaks to how he surveys voters who say they\u2019re undecided. \u201cAt least, we have to be self-aware of what we are doing,\u201d he said. \u201cYou look at all your data and everything you do and you make some adjustments, but in the end you have to trust your data, recognizing that the data can be wrong.\u201d That\u2019s certainly a lesson President Trump remembers. His campaign is trying to recapture the magic by running on the same message of cracking down on immigration, race-baiting and skepticism toward conventional political wisdom \u2014 starting with ignoring what he calls \u201cphony polling.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m going to do it the same way I did it the first time,\u201d he said in an interview with ABC News last month. Democrats remain far more divided over what lessons their party should draw from the last race. \u201cThere\u2019s something fundamental about the fact that Trump presented himself as a noxious human and still won that is disconcerting and unsettling about America,\u201d said Adam Jentleson, a Democratic strategist working for a group focused on suing Mr. Trump. \u201cBut the why, we don\u2019t know. It depends who you talk to.\u201d Senator Elizabeth Warren rarely mentions Mr. Trump in her stump speech, focusing instead on her plans for transforming the country\u2019s economy. Mr. Biden takes nearly the exact opposite tack, weaving his opposition to the current president into nearly all parts of his argument. His supporters argue that the race will be won by convincing moderates that the Democratic nominee is a safer choice than Mr. Trump. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get moderate working-class Democrats back,\u201d said former Gov. Ed Rendell of Pennsylvania, who\u2019s backing Mr. Biden. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get candidates that they can relate to.\u201d Senator Kamala Harris, meanwhile, argues that the path to victory for Democrats runs through energizing the women, people of color, and younger voters that make up the backbone of the party. Her campaign, along with others in the party, believes that mobilizing these voters in cities like Detroit, Milwaukee and Philadelphia could make the difference in the three states in question. \u201cThere are things we all understand about what happened in 2016 aside from Russian interference,\u201d said Adrianne Shropshire, who runs BlackPAC, an African-American political organizing group. \u201cWhat is clear is that there were key segments of the Democratic base that stayed home.\u201d Others think that Democrats should spend less time and money in traditional swing states like Ohio and Iowa and instead focus on shifting their map into the rapidly changing Sun Belt, where they found success during the 2018 midterms. All the uncertainty has left some Democrats urging voters to take a truly radical stance: Just vote for who you believe in. \u201cPut your money on someone who energizes and excites you,\u201d said Mr. Jentleson, \u201crather than someone who appeals to a voter in a diner in rural Michigan who you invited in your head.\u201d",

      "author": "Michael D. Shear",
      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump declared himself vindicated by Wednesday\u2019s congressional appearance of Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, calling it a \u201cdevastating\u201d day for Democrats that exposed the Russia investigation as a \u201choax\u201d and a yearslong \u201cphony cloud\u201d over his head. Speaking to reporters as he boarded Marine One for a brief trip to West Virginia to host a fund-raiser, the president said that Mr. Mueller was \u201chorrible\u201d during his testimony before two House committees and in his handling of the investigation. \u201cWe had a good day today,\u201d Mr. Trump said, echoing a sense of jubilation inside the White House that Democrats had failed in their bid to use Mr. Mueller to build a case for impeachment against the president. \u201cThis was a devastating day for the Democrats,\u201d Mr. Trump said, adding: \u201cThe Democrats had nothing. And now they have less than nothing. And I think they are going to lose the 2020 election very big, including congressional elections.\u201d \u201cToday proved a lot to everybody,\u201d he said. Mr. Trump spent the morning in the White House residence, where he watched portions of the first hearing, according to people familiar with his activities. He went down to the Oval Office by the time the second hearing had begun, but he was not in front of a television for longer than 15 minutes at a time, according to one adviser. He moved back and forth from the small dining room adjacent to the Oval Office to the Resolute Desk for a number of meetings, including one about prescription drug prices with two Republican representatives, Kevin McCarthy of California, the minority leader, and Mark Meadows of North Carolina. Mr. Trump\u2019s comments in the afternoon reflected the growing excitement inside the West Wing that Mr. Mueller had fallen flat in his performance. One person who spoke with Mr. Trump said he took note of Mr. Mueller\u2019s physical appearance and halting response to some questions. \u201cI think Robert Mueller did a horrible job, both today and with respect to the investigation,\u201d Mr. Trump said, adding: \u201cObviously he did very poorly today. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anybody \u2014 even among the fakers \u2014 I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anybody that would say he did well.\u201d Mr. Trump also panned Mr. Mueller\u2019s performance during the nearly seven hours of testimony, including retweeting critics of the special counsel\u2019s appearance to 62 million followers throughout the morning hearing of the House Judiciary Committee. \u201cI would like to thank the Democrats for holding this morning\u2019s hearing,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote after Mr. Mueller testified in front of the Judiciary Committee and as the special counsel prepared to testify in front of the House Intelligence Committee, led by Representative Adam B. Schiff of California. \u201cNow, after 3 hours, Robert Mueller has to subject himself to #ShiftySchiff - an Embarrassment to our Country!\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted. The president had already given his online stamp of approval to a series of tweets critical of Mr. Mueller\u2019s appearance. \u201cThis has been a disaster for the Democrats and a disaster for the reputation of Robert Mueller,\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted about 90 minutes after the first hearing began, attributing the comment to Chris Wallace, the host of \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d A few minutes later, Mr. Trump retweeted Tom Fitton, the president of Judicial Watch, a conservative organization: \u201cNo collusion. No obstruction, No impeachment. Shut the coup cabal down!\u201d The series of posts suggested that Mr. Trump was glued to the television as Mr. Mueller was grilled by lawmakers. And they appeared to confirm that the president was relieved by Mr. Mueller\u2019s halting performance. That was certainly the message from some of the president\u2019s top aides, who also began tweeting about Mr. Mueller. In response to a tweet quoting Mr. Mueller as saying that his investigation did not establish that the Trump campaign conspired with the Russian government, Kellyanne Conway, the president\u2019s counselor, wrote three words: \u201cDrop the Mic!\u201d Mr. Trump started shouting on Twitter before 7 a.m., venting about what he called the \u201cGreatest Witch Hunt in U.S. history\u201d even as Mr. Mueller was headed to Capitol Hill. By 8:10, the president had posted seven more times, delivering a kind of Twitter greatest hits \u2014 punctuated by capital letters and exclamation points \u2014 in which he portrayed himself as the innocent victim of an illegal crusade by Mr. Mueller, Democrats and the country\u2019s intelligence community. He said that his accusers were part of an \u201cillegal and treasonous attack on our Country.\u201d He complained again about the \u201c18 angry Democrats\u201d he asserted were on the Mueller team and asked why the special counsel did not investigate \u201cLyin\u2019 & Leakin\u2019 James Comey,\u201d the former F.B.I. director whom Mr. Trump fired, and others. The president attacked Mr. Mueller\u2019s credibility, repeating his unsubstantiated claim that the special counsel was \u201chighly conflicted.\u201d He then said: \u201cNO COLLUSION, NO OBSTRUCTION!\u201d and \u201cKEEP AMERICA GREAT!\u201d On Tuesday, Mr. Trump had shrugged off the impending testimony, telling reporters that he would not watch the hearings on Wednesday, then admitting that \u201cmaybe I\u2019ll see a little bit of it.\u201d But the president\u2019s early-morning online activities betrayed his real intentions, indicating once again that Mr. Trump appeared consumed by the investigation that had dominated much of his presidency. During a private fund-raiser in Wheeling, W.Va., however, Mr. Trump\u2019s focus shifted. \u201cHe spoke very little of the Mueller report,\u201d said Alice Frankovitch, a Republican who lives in Weirton, W.Va. \u201cHe was mainly talking about all of the accomplishments he\u2019s done so far in his presidency: the economy, the jobs, increasing the military. He covered a lot of coal.\u201d But Mr. Trump\u2019s feelings about Mr. Mueller\u2019s testimony were mirrored by some of his supporters. \u201cHe submitted his report,\u201d Ms. Frankovitch said. \u201cI think that should have been enough.\u201d Interviews with residents of Wheeling during the hearings largely broke down along partisan lines, with supporters of the president scoffing at Mr. Mueller\u2019s testimony and Democrats saying that the special counsel had highlighted misdeeds by Mr. Trump. At DiCarlo\u2019s Pizza, about 500 feet from the Trump fund-raiser, the TV was tuned to NBC\u2019s airing of Mr. Mueller\u2019s testimony. Diners watched it between bites of pizza and hoagies. \u201cI thought they already came out with the whole report and didn\u2019t really find any collusion or whatever Trump was talking about, so I\u2019m not sure what they\u2019re doing now again,\u201d said Patrick Hynes, a mechanic from Chicago who said Congress had nothing better to do. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to do anything about the immigration crisis they\u2019ve got a problem with and all this other stuff,\u201d Mr. Hynes added. Scott Jackson, a registered Republican who considers himself more of an independent, called the Mueller investigation a \u201cscam\u201d and \u201ca total witch hunt.\u201d Mr. Jackson, a lifelong Wheeling resident who collects unemployment benefits after having lost his job in the gas and oil industry in December, said: \u201cI don\u2019t think that anything that Mueller has done has had any positive effect for the nation. I believe that it\u2019s lies.\u201d But Cheryl Prichard, a Democrat and retired college professor of speech pathology, said Mr. Mueller helped make clear that \u201claws were broken and that it\u2019s up to Congress to do their constitutional duty and institute an impeachment hearing.\u201d \u201cI thought the Democrats were asking questions to gather information,\u201d Ms. Prichard said, \u201cand I thought the Republicans were making comments and asking questions to get Trump re-elected.\u201d",

      "content": " Kamala Harris is prepared to \u201cbreak things.\u201d Elizabeth Warren said she would \u201cpersist.\u201d Amy Klobuchar has challenged voters to discount women \u201cat your own peril,\u201d while Tulsi Gabbard insisted that a presidential race with six women is not an anomaly but \u201cwhat an election should look like.\u201d The women running for president are promising many things as they make their pitches to voters. They are being asked repeatedly how being women may affect their chances. But so far, none of them are emphasizing the \u201cglass ceiling.\u201d In fact, the phrase \u201cglass ceiling\u201d was trending recently not because of anything the candidates had said, but because of Nike. In an ad celebrating the World Cup-winning United States women\u2019s soccer team, a narrator intones, over black-and-white imagery of the players, the \u201cI believe\u201d chant \u2014 completing it to say that women will \u201cconquer more than just the soccer field, like breaking every single glass ceiling.\u201d The symbol remains intact. In politics, the phrase became associated with the aspirations of Hillary Clinton, who spoke at key moments of success and defeat about cracking the glass ceiling. But in this barrier-breaking field of female candidates, it is noticeably absent. [Sign up for In Her Words, a newsletter where women rule the headlines] \u201cWords have their moments, especially colloquialisms,\u201d said the linguist Robin Lakoff, professor emerita at the University of California, Berkeley, whose 1975 book, \u201cLanguage and Woman\u2019s Place,\u201d helped create the field of gender linguistics. \u201cOften, after a word or phrase gets a lot of use, people simply stop using it \u2014 because we like to sound original and this one seems tired.\u201d Which is not to say it is entirely verboten \u2014 or that metaphorical ceilings are not actually being shattered. Kirsten Gillibrand tweeted the term this month as part of a pledge for gender parity in national security, while Marianne Williamson notes on her campaign website that the \u201cproverbial glass ceiling\u201d is one of the things holding women back. Aside from the record-breaking number of female candidates for president \u2014 along with those serving in Congress \u2014 there are more female chief executives in the Fortune 500 than ever before (though, of course, that number is still just 33), and a recent study published in the journal American Psychologist found that a majority of Americans believe that women are just as competent as men \u2014 if not more. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty dramatic shift,\u201d said Alice Eagly, a social psychologist at Northwestern University who led the work, analyzing public perceptions over 70 years. As a term, the \u201cglass ceiling\u201d dates to around 1978, when it was discussed by female workers at Hewlett-Packard and used onstage at a panel discussion about women\u2019s aspirations by an employee of the New York Telephone Co. Each used it to describe the inability of white-collar women to rise beyond the mid-manager level in their jobs, and the often invisible barriers preventing that rise. The phrase gained traction in the mid-1980s, when it appeared in an article in Adweek (quoting the outgoing editor of Working Woman magazine) and then a headline in The Wall Street Journal (\u201cThe Glass Ceiling: Why Women Can\u2019t Seem to Break the Invisible Barrier That Blocks Them From the Top Jobs\u201d). The New York Times ran an article in 1986 \u2014 the same year it proclaimed that, architecturally speaking, buildings made of see-through glass were \u201cgetting good reviews\u201d\u2014 about the glass ceiling for female politicians, quoting Betty Friedan, co-founder of the National Organization for Women. \u201cOur women tried to go higher and I wonder whether they ran into a glass ceiling,\u201d Ms. Friedan said then, recalling the unsuccessful campaigns of Carol Bellamy for mayor of New York, Elizabeth Holtzman for the Senate and Geraldine Ferraro for vice president. \u201cIn corporations, women get to a middle level and then there\u2019s a glass ceiling \u2014 not overt discrimination, just a feeling that you can go this high and no higher.\u201d In the years following, the term continued to go mainstream \u2014 a kind of linguistic shorthand for a problem that could be difficult to pinpoint or describe. By the 1990s it had been used to describe the experiences of Navy women, female lawyers, women in banking, older women, black professionals (women and men), women who worked on the campaign of George Bush and the plight of female journalists \u2014 as explained by The Washington Post\u2019s board chair at the time, Katharine Graham. More recently, it has been uttered by the likes of Priyanka Chopra, the actor Brie Larson (who this year played Captain Marvel in a rare female-led superhero film) and Madeleine Albright, who wore a glass-ceiling brooch to the Democratic National Convention in 2016. Still, nobody has used the allegory quite like Mrs. Clinton, who has for years talked about the \u201chighest, hardest glass ceiling\u201d she was determined to crack. She spoke of it movingly in her 2008 concession speech, saying that while she was not able to shatter it, the ceiling now had \u201cabout 18 million cracks.\u201d Eight years later, when she became the first female nominee of a major party\u2019s ticket, she leaned into the metaphor even harder. When she spoke by video to the Democratic National Convention a virtual glass ceiling broke onscreen; she accepted the nomination later in the week while saying, \u201cWhen there are no ceilings, the sky\u2019s the limit.\u201d And then, of course, there was the fateful night at the Javits Center in Manhattan, under a literal glass ceiling where confetti shaped like glass shards was supposed to rain from above as Mrs. Clinton acknowledged victory. \u201cI remember thinking that the symbolism was going to feel so satisfying,\u201d said Emma Gray, 31, who reports on women\u2019s issues for HuffPost and remembers staring upward during a quiet moment at the Javits Center on election night. \u201cWe were under a literal glass ceiling and that ceiling was going to metaphorically shatter. And then it did not.\u201d The next morning, Mrs. Clinton gave a concession speech and Google Search results for \u201cglass ceiling\u201d peaked, higher even than their previous peak during the Democratic National Convention that summer. She noted somberly that while \u201cwe have still not shattered that highest and hardest glass ceiling,\u201d someone would, eventually. With six women in the 2020 race, perhaps the phrase seems \u201calmost a little bit embarrassing, or maybe just irrelevant,\u201d said Ms. Lakoff, the linguist, adding that \u201cof course it\u2019s not.\u201d Which is not to say that the candidates are thinking about gender any less. To the contrary, the less they talk about it the more it might indicate they\u2019re actually thinking about it more. \u201cThere\u2019s a worry that if you draw too much attention to these biases, to your womanhood, that it reinforces people\u2019s doubts about it,\u201d said Adam Grant, an organizational psychologist at the Wharton School of Business, pointing to research from the corporate world that illustrated that point. \u201cSo if I were a female candidate in this cycle, which I realize is a strange sentence to say, I would be afraid that talking about the glass ceiling would only reinforce it.\u201d And, anyway, there are other terms to play around with these days \u2014 such as \u201cglass cliff,\u201d to describe the phenomenon of women and minorities being tasked with leadership during periods of crisis, which was recently added to Dictionary.com. (The \u201ccliff\u201d part is the idea that they\u2019re being set up to fail.) Or \u201cmotherhood penalty\u201d to describe bias specifically against working mothers and \u201clikability trap\u201d to refer to the challenge female leaders face by having to prove they are tough and likable at once. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the 29-year-old congresswoman from New York, has opted for \u201cshake the table\u201d and \u201cbuild our own house\u201d to describe breaking barriers, while Ayanna S. Pressley, the first black woman elected to Congress from Massachusetts, has noted that, \u201cWhen it comes to women of color candidates, folks don\u2019t just talk about a glass ceiling. What they describe is a concrete one.\u201d This time around, Ms. Klobuchar noted that the term itself isn\u2019t just about winning the White House \u2014 it\u2019s about running in the first place. The number of women in the race is \u201ca testament to the progress we have made,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are still barriers, but the highest and hardest glass ceiling has so many cracks in it, it is well on its way to becoming an outdated standard.\u201d",

Agent Says His Firing Was Politically Motivated|August 7, 2019, Page A18",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Peter Strzok, the F.B.I. senior counterintelligence agent in the Hillary Clinton email and Russia investigations who made inflammatory comments about President Trump in text messages, sued the Justice Department and the F.B.I. on Tuesday for firing him. The F.B.I. said last summer that it had terminated Mr. Strzok for violating bureau policies, but he said in his lawsuit that he was fired because of political pressure from Mr. Trump, who has made a frequent target of Mr. Strzok in his public statements. \u201cThe F.B.I. fired Special Agent Strzok because of his protected political speech in violation of his rights under the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States,\u201d the lawsuit said. Mr. Strzok said his termination also violated his due process rights. The Justice Department declined to comment, and the F.B.I. said it does not comment on pending litigation. Mr. Strzok, who is seeking reinstatement to his job and a monetary award, was removed from the Russia investigation after it emerged that he had sent disparaging text messages about Mr. Trump to Lisa Page, an F.B.I. lawyer at the time who also worked on both investigations. Those messages, sent during the heat of the 2016 presidential election as the F.B.I. was investigating both candidates, were uncovered during an inquiry by the Justice Department inspector general into the handling of the Clinton email investigation. In their messages to each other, Ms. Page and Mr. Strzok said they did not want Mr. Trump to become president. In one exchange, Ms. Page asks: Mr. Trump is \u201cnot ever going to become president, right? Right?!\u201d Mr. Strzok responds: \u201cNo. No he won\u2019t. We\u2019ll stop it.\u201d Mr. Trump and his allies seized on the messages as evidence that the investigation into potential ties between his campaign and Russia was politically biased. The president discussed Mr. Strzok on Twitter dozens of times last year, criticizing his conduct. Mr. Strzok testified before Congress last summer that he had not let his political opinions interfere with the Clinton and Russia investigations. The inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, said the messages were \u201cnot only indicative of a biased state of mind but, even more seriously, implies a willingness to take official action to impact the presidential candidate\u2019s electoral prospects.\u201d Nevertheless, Mr. Horowitz also said he had found no evidence that Mr. Strzok\u2019s political views had influenced his investigative decisions. In response to the investigation\u2019s critical findings, the F.B.I. moved to discipline Mr. Strzok, who had worked at the bureau for 20 years and become one of its most experienced counterintelligence agents. The bureau recommended firing Mr. Strzok in June 2018, but the Office of Professional Responsibility recommended that August that he be demoted and suspended for 60 days without pay, according to Mr. Strzok\u2019s lawsuit. Mr. Strzok said in his filing that he agreed to that recommendation. But the next day, the bureau fired Mr. Strzok, effective immediately. Days before Mr. Strzok was fired, Mr. Trump said on Twitter that Mr. Strzok \u201cshould have recused himself on day one,\u201d and that he had improperly tried to influence the election. Mr. Strzok contends in his lawsuit that the firing \u201cwas the result of unrelenting pressure from President Trump and his political allies in Congress and the media.\u201d He said the campaign to fire him included \u201cconstant tweets and other disparaging statements by the president,\u201d as well as direct appeals by Mr. Trump to Jeff Sessions, the attorney general at the time, and the F.B.I. director, Christopher A. Wray. Mr. Strzok also said in his complaint that the Justice Department\u2019s decision to disclose his private text messages to the news media violated his rights under the Privacy Act, which governs federal records and protects against unwarranted disclosure of personal information. \u201cWhile many in law enforcement have faced attacks by this president, Pete Strzok has been a constant target for two years,\u201d Aitan D. Goelman, a partner with Zuckerman Spaeder and one of Mr. Strzok\u2019s lawyers, said in a statement. \u201cThe lawsuit shows that, in bowing to the president\u2019s desires, F.B.I. leaders trampled Pete\u2019s free speech and due process rights in ways that should be deeply troubling to all in government, and indeed, to all Americans,\u201d Mr. Goelman said. In addition to reinstatement, Mr. Strzok is asking for back pay and damages for violations of the Privacy Act.",

      "author": "Maggie Haberman",
      "content": "  President Trump has long used his fame and platform to amplify conspiracy theories and undermine his political enemies by muddying the waters when it comes to facts. For years, he has helped to erode voter faith in institutions by invoking the idea of a sinister force \u2014 such as the \u201cdeep state\u201d or a rigged electoral system \u2014 that is thwarting the will of the people in an attempt to undermine him. But a macabre subgenre of Mr. Trump\u2019s fondness for conspiracy theories has been to accuse, directly or indirectly, his political enemies of murder. In the heat of the 2016 Republican primary, Mr. Trump elevated an unsubstantiated rumor, published by the Trump-friendly National Enquirer, insinuating that the father of one of his rivals, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, had been involved in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Earlier that year, he fed into the idea that Antonin Scalia, a Supreme Court justice who died in his sleep in 2016, could have actually been murdered in his bed. On Saturday, two and a half years into his presidency and hours after Jeffrey Epstein, the financier accused of sex trafficking, was found dead in a federal jail cell in Manhattan, Mr. Trump once again weighed in by elevating an online conspiracy theory that the Clintons were linked to his death. Mr. Epstein \u201chad information on Bill Clinton & now he\u2019s dead,\u201d Terrence Williams, a comedian and Trump supporter, wrote on Twitter on Saturday. Mr. Williams also noted that \u201cfor some odd reason, people that have information on the Clintons end up dead.\u201d Mr. Trump promptly shared the baseless insinuation online by retweeting it to his 63 million followers. Mr. Trump, who is entering the thick of election season, has yet to find any candidate in the crowded Democratic field whom he delights in invoking as much as his forever foils, Bill and Hillary Clinton, the onetime reigning couple of Democratic politics who have been the subject of conspiracy mongering on the right for decades. Even though the Clintons have retreated from politics, \u201cit\u2019s one of those things that continue to live on,\u201d said Douglas Brinkley, the historian. Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to weigh in on the case of Mr. Epstein\u2019s apparent suicide, even while his own Justice Department is investigating, also had a political imperative behind it, Mr. Brinkley said. \u201cThe first thing Trump wanted to do was put Bill Clinton into the mix,\u201d he added. \u201cMake it about Bubba, not about the Donald.\u201d Mr. Clinton and Mr. Epstein were first linked in 2002, when it was reported that the former president took his first of four trips aboard Mr. Epstein\u2019s private jet, for a trip related to Mr. Clinton\u2019s work on his foundation, according to a Clinton spokesman, and Mr. Clinton has stressed that he has not been in touch with Mr. Epstein in over a decade. But Mr. Trump has his own long history with Mr. Epstein, one he has been playing down since before he began his presidential campaign. The two New Yorkers were friends through the 1990s, and into the 2000s, and in at least one instance, were even caught on camera ogling women together at Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump\u2019s Palm Beach, Fla., estate. The source of their eventual falling out \u2014 which Mr. Trump has highlighted more than the friendship itself \u2014 has been in dispute. Whether he believes the theories he promotes or not, Mr. Trump knows that many people will latch onto them, lured by the idea that a hidden force is controlling fate. \u201cHe revels in conspiracy theories because he knows it gives him quick and easy traction with the masses \u2014 they\u2019re easily swayed by the notion that there is an organized group getting over on them,\u201d said Timothy L. O\u2019Brien, a journalist and one of Mr. Trump\u2019s biographers. \u201cBecause he never feels remorse or guilt about peddling these fables, he dives right in even when he knows better.\u201d On Saturday, when the news of Mr. Epstein\u2019s death broke, Mr. Trump was at his New Jersey golf club, where he plans to spend his vacation and where, accompanied by few aides, he often uses Twitter more freely than when he is at the White House. \u201cIt\u2019s another example of something where he should stop and think about the fact that he\u2019s the president of the United States, and stop his thumbs, but he never does,\u201d said Rich Lowry, a columnist and editor of the conservative National Review. In the murky story of Mr. Epstein\u2019s death, Mr. Trump found particularly fertile soil: the demise of an accused pedophile with powerful friends, whose apparent suicide in a federal Manhattan jail has raised questions about \u201cserious irregularities\u201d and has many people \u2014 not just Mr. Trump \u2014 speculating in public about what might have really taken place. \u201cSomething stinks to high heaven,\u201d Claire McCaskill, a Democratic former senator from Missouri, wrote on Twitter. By Monday, however, some of Mr. Trump\u2019s closest advisers sought to tamp down the talk of a conspiracy now that the Justice Department is involved in the investigation. Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, had suggested on Saturday that he found Mr. Epstein\u2019s death suspicious. But on Monday, he said: \u201cIt is best to wait for some key facts like the findings of the autopsy. Withholding judgment is the wisest course to follow. D.O.J. is very motivated to get to the bottom of it.\u201d Waiting for facts to settle, however, has never been Mr. Trump\u2019s preferred style. Mr. Trump has repeatedly used conspiracies to bond with his supporters since promoting the false story that President Barack Obama was born in Kenya, rather than Hawaii, which helped him rise in the polls in 2011 when he first considered a run for president. \u201cConspiracy theories are a perfect tool to emotionally connect with voters and supporters,\u201d said Sam Nunberg, a former campaign aide. Last year, Mr. Trump promoted accusations that a \u201ccriminal deep state\u201d element within the government had planted a spy inside his presidential campaign to try to help Mrs. Clinton win the presidency \u2014 a scheme he branded \u201cSpygate.\u201d And during the 2016 campaign, he promoted the idea of foul play as a reason for Justice Scalia\u2019s death. \u201cI\u2019m hearing it\u2019s a big topic,\u201d he said then. \u201cIt\u2019s a horrible topic but they\u2019re saying they found the pillow on his face, which is a pretty unusual place to find a pillow,\u201d Mr. Trump told the radio host Michael Savage.",

      "author": "Linda Qiu",
      "content": " Mr. Trump lost the popular vote by almost 2.9 million in the 2016 election and has long attributed this loss to baseless claims of voter fraud. Now Mr. Trump suggests that he would have lost the popular vote by a much smaller margin, or even won it, were it not for Google\u2019s machinations. He appears to be referring to a disputed estimate given by Robert Epstein, a psychologist and former editor in chief at Psychology Today who says he supported and voted for Hillary Clinton. In a 2017 white paper, Mr. Epstein examined how Google Search might have influenced undecided voters in the 2016 election by providing more positive results for one candidate than the other. He estimated that the search results may have swayed \u201cat least 2.6 million votes to Clinton.\u201d When he testified to Congress this summer, Mr. Epstein added that the estimate was a \u201crock bottom minimum\u201d and that up to 10.4 million votes could have been shifted to Mrs. Clinton. In an interview, Mr. Epstein took issue with Mr. Trump\u2019s characterization of his work. \u201cI\u2019ve never said Google manipulated the 2016 elections,\u201d he said. \u201cThe range of numbers he listed in the tweet is also incorrect.\u201d Panagiotis Metaxas, a computer science professor at Wellesley College, emphasized that the white paper showed a possibility \u2014 \u201cwhat such an influence could have been if Google was manipulating its electoral search results\u201d \u2014 not a conclusive fact. \u201cI and other researchers who have been auditing search results for years know that this did not happen,\u201d Mr. Metaxas said. \u201cI think that, in his congressional hearing, Dr. Epstein is misrepresenting the situation.\u201d He noted that Google does \u201csanitize\u201d its search results, prioritizing more trusted sources while devaluing low-quality information sources. (Here\u2019s a more detailed explanation of how Google Search works.) The white paper also came with huge caveats. First, it was not peer-reviewed or rigorously evaluated by other researchers. It was based on the daily online searches of just 95 participants, 21 of whom were self-described undecided voters \u2014 a small sample size to extrapolate to millions of voters, experts said. (Mr. Epstein says that the statistical significance of his findings was high.) Their election-related search results were then given to another group of people who evaluated whether the results were biased toward Mr. Trump or Mrs. Clinton, and concluded that most favored Mrs. Clinton. Searches conducted on other websites like Yahoo and Bing did not display the same bias, according to the paper. Then, Mr. Epstein applied his previous research demonstrating that biased search results could shift voting preferences by 20 percent or more to reach his baseline estimate of 2.6 million people affected. But it takes \u201ca leap of faith\u201d to connect Mr. Epstein\u2019s experimental results to actual election outcomes, said Nicholas Diakopoulos, an assistant professor in communication studies at Northwestern University. (Mr. Diakopoulos\u2019s own research does show that Google Search results favor Democrats.) \u201cThere\u2019s a substantial shift in context, and a difference in asking someone in an experiment about likely voting behavior and how they might actually act during an election,\u201d Mr. Diakopoulos said. A more meticulous scientific analysis measuring the impact of Google Search on election outcomes could, for example, take into account voter history or other sources of election information. Given the difficulties in disaggregating the impact of Google and the paper\u2019s lack of methodological detail, Mr. Diakopoulos said, \u201cI am skeptical of the validity of the estimates.\u201d Curious about the accuracy of a claim?

Women can be large and contain multitudes, too.\u201d \u2014 Amy Chozick, on what it means to have multiple female candidates for president Welcome to the In Her Words Elevator Interview \u2014 a summer series showcasing the voices of Times writers and editors, which we attempted to conduct inside our (very slow) corporate elevators, but then the elevator broke, and actually that wasn\u2019t really enough time to ask what we wanted to ask anyway, so now we conduct them over email. This week we spoke with Amy Chozick, a Times writer-at-large and best-selling author of \u201cChasing Hillary,\u201d which documents her decade covering Hillary Clinton\u2019s pursuit of the presidency. IHW: Tell us about your routine. What do you do to start your day and how do you wind down at night? I used to think that I would spend my mornings rocking my baby while listening to Otis Redding, and it\u2019s more like picking up thrown cereal while listening to \u201cBaby Shark.\u201d We\u2019ve usually already gone to Trader Joe\u2019s (pro tip: Trader Joe\u2019s is bliss at 8 a.m. on a weekday) and Target and, depending on the weather, a swing set, by the time the caregiver arrives at 9 a.m. I always walk to get my coffee. This is totally unnecessary as the train is across the street from my house, but the 30-minute walk is my daily ritual, my time to put the chaos of the morning behind me, listen to an audiobook or podcast, and get in the mind-set for work. I get to the office by 9:45 or 10 a.m. After work, on an ideal day, I make it to a cardio dance workout class in my neighborhood. (I have zero rhythm, but five minutes in I feel like the Jewish J-Lo.) I also like boxing because sometimes you need to punch something. I get home by 7 p.m., and start cooking dinner. I could burn toast if left to my own devices, so it\u2019s usually a HelloFresh meal kit. Our son has gotten into the habit of turning off the oven while I\u2019m cooking. This cracks him up. It also adds at least 15 minutes to the process. My husband changes him and puts him to sleep around 8 and we eat dinner. We watch some TV (usually some combination of \u201cTrue Detective\u201d and \u201cBachelor in Paradise\u201d). We talk a little and stare at our phones a lot. Around 10 p.m. I\u2019ll take a CBD gummy bear. People say it\u2019s a placebo or snake oil, but don\u2019t knock those little suckers until you\u2019ve tried them. Do you have any writing rituals? Pre-baby, when I was writing my book, I had this whole ritual that involved an iced red eye (cold brew with a shot of espresso), leggings and some real ergonomic jujitsu at my dining room table. That\u2019s impossible now, so I come to the office and listen to jazz. I still need to be heavily caffeinated, but sadly can\u2019t wear leggings. I wish I could write more in the mornings because that\u2019s when I\u2019m the most creative and productive, but, well, \u201cBaby Shark.\u201d The great thing about being a beat reporter for so many years is that you can\u2019t have writer\u2019s block or be picky about creating the perfect environment. You have to just do it \u2026 writing on my lap on a campaign bus in rural Iowa really helped me realize that. In moments of self-doubt, how do you build yourself back up? I am constantly doubting myself. We learn as journalists that we\u2019re only as good as our last byline so now that I write features that can take months, I have these long periods when I feel like I have disappeared and will never write another story. I am a failure, a nobody, I will die alone under a pile of tawny newspaper clippings. This is when my editor, Ellen Pollock, says, \u201cAmy, you had a story last week.\u201d Your book documents your time covering Hillary Clinton, and you recently wrote a piece for Vogue about the current cohort of women candidates. What difference do you see in how this new generation of women are rolling out their campaigns? I don\u2019t think we can underestimate how meaningful it is that so many women of so many different backgrounds and beliefs are competing for the Democratic nomination. Think about it \u2014 before 2020, we\u2019d never seen multiple women on the presidential debate stage. They have permanently changed our perception of what a presidential campaign looks like and taught us (hopefully once and for all) that women can disagree with each other without it being a catfight. Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris and Tulsi Gabbard all have vastly different visions for the country and guess what? That is fine. Healthy, even. We don\u2019t all have to be sorority sisters or wear pink on Wednesdays. Women can be large and contain multitudes, too. ______ Here are five articles from The Times you might have missed. [Sign up here to get future installments of In Her Words delivered to your inbox.] ______ Three pieces by Amy Chozick you might want to reread. In July 2013, Jill Abramson, the former executive editor of The Times, put Amy Chozick on the \u201cHillary beat\u201d ahead of the 2016 election. It was 649 days before Mrs. Clinton would announce she was running for president again; 1,226 days before she would lose to Donald Trump. Every major life decision in her 20s and 30s, Ms. Chozick writes in her book \u2014 when to get married, where to buy an apartment, whether to freeze her eggs until after the election \u2014 had revolved around a single looming question: What about Hillary Clinton? You probably remember the story. How in 1993, Lorena Bobbitt cut off her husband\u2019s penis with a kitchen knife as he slept. How she then disposed of the detached penis out the driver\u2019s side window. How she later told the police where it was, they found it, put it on ice and rushed it to the hospital, where in a nine-hour surgery it was reattached and restored to (almost) full function. In January, Lorena Bobbitt opened up about how that one night changed her life. In the swirl of #MeToo, perhaps no woman has found herself at the center of the storm quite like Gayle King. Millions of viewers have watched, again and again, as she and her co-host Norah O\u2019Donnell of \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d have had to explain \u2014 live on air \u2014 the alleged misdeeds of executives at their very own network, like Charlie Rose and Leslie Moonves. Last fall, Ms. Chozick interviewed Ms. King about her decades long career in broadcast news.",

SaysIowa Democrats wanted to allow some caucusgoers to vote by phone next year, but committee leaders concluded that such a system would not be secure. They plan to give the state, and Nevada, waivers from new party rules.By Reid J. EpsteinPRINT EDITIONIowa and Nevada Caucuses May Get Pass on Including Remote Voters|August 31, 2019, Page A15",
      "author": "Reid J. Epstein",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 The Democratic National Committee said Friday it would recommend exemptions to Iowa and Nevada that would allow them to avoid new guidelines requiring caucus states to allow remote participation without attending a caucus event. The waivers avert, for now, a showdown over voting rules between the committee and early caucus states. The proposed waivers, which are expected to be approved by the party\u2019s powerful rules and bylaws committee, come after D.N.C. leadership signaled it would block plans to allow some caucusgoers in Iowa and Nevada to vote by phone next year, bowing to security concerns about the process being hacked, according to four people with knowledge of the decision. The committee\u2019s announcement serves as a major setback to Democrats who have long hoped to expand the caucus-state electorate beyond those voters able to attend a winter-night gathering for several hours. \u201cPeople who believe in democracy and believe that people who are working or physically challenged should be able to participate are screwed by this decision,\u201d said Larry Cohen, a D.N.C. member from Maryland who has long advocated allowing absentee participation in caucuses. Mr. Cohen, who was a senior official on the 2016 Bernie Sanders campaign, said Friday that Iowa and Nevada still have time to create a system to participate in caucuses by mail. With five months to go before Iowa\u2019s first-in-the-nation caucuses, it was not clear what alternatives the state\u2019s Democrats have to allow absentee participation. Troy Price, the Iowa Democratic Party chairman, said he would \u201cexplore what alternatives may exist to securely increase accessibility from previous years given the time allowed.\u201d \u201cRegardless of today\u2019s news, we remain confident the 2020 Iowa Caucuses will be our best yet, and set the standard for years to come,\u201d Mr. Price said. In August 2018, D.N.C. members voted to adopt new rules for the 2020 presidential primary that encouraged states that held caucuses to switch to primaries and required caucus states to allow for a form of participation that did not require attending an event. Other reforms included reducing the power of the party\u2019s superdelegates. The D.N.C. rules preserved Iowa\u2019s place at the front of the presidential nominating calendar, but in New Hampshire, whose state constitution requires it to hold the first presidential primary, officials are highly sensitive to Iowa\u2019s moves to alter its caucus in ways that make it appear more like a primary. Iowa Democrats said Friday that they feared mailing absentee paper ballots for their caucus would lead the New Hampshire secretary of state, Bill Gardner, to jump his state ahead of Iowa on the presidential calendar. Mr. Gardner has sole authority to set the date of New Hampshire\u2019s primary. The presidential campaigns had spent months training their Iowa volunteers to recruit supporters to participate in the phone caucuses. Now they must revert to how Iowa caucus campaigns have been run for generations, persuading people to attend in-person events on a cold February night. Julian Castro, the former secretary of housing and urban development, called the decision to abandon phone caucuses \u201can affront to the principles of our democracy.\u201d \u201cAs I\u2019ve campaigned in every corner of Iowa, I\u2019ve heard from teachers, home care workers, nurses, single parents, shift workers, and senior citizens who tell me the same thing: One night of caucusing is not enough,\u201d Mr. Castro said Friday. Iowa Democrats, along with party officials in other states, face a Sept. 13 deadline for the D.N.C. to approve plans for their presidential primaries and caucuses. Iowa\u2019s caucuses are scheduled to be held Feb. 3. The Iowa Democrats were proposing a plan that would have allowed voters not attending a traditional caucus to register their preference during one of six \u201cvirtual caucuses\u201d over the phone. But D.N.C. security officials told the rules committee at a closed-door session in San Francisco last week that they had \u201cno confidence\u201d such a system could remain safe from hostile hackers. The D.N.C.\u2019s leadership concluded that the technology that exists is not secure and poses too large a risk of interference from a foreign adversary, according to officials with knowledge of the deliberations. Several presidential campaigns expressed concern to top party officials that Iowa\u2019s results could be compromised, people familiar with the discussions said Thursday. The rules and bylaws committee has the power to approve state plans for primaries and caucuses. [Sign up for our politics newsletter and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race.] The Democratic caucuses in Iowa can be hourslong affairs on often snowy winter nights. The state\u2019s caucus rules require a candidate to receive support from at least 15 percent of the voters in the room; backers of candidates who fail to meet the 15 percent threshold are then freed to choose a different candidate. This leads to haggling and horse-trading between campaigns and places a premium on being a caucusgoer\u2019s second or even third choice. Party forces allied with Hillary Clinton have argued for years that states should shift from caucuses to primaries \u2014 or at least make the caucus process more accessible to people who cannot attend in person. Nine states that held Democratic presidential caucuses in 2016 \u2014 Alaska, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Maine, Minnesota, Nebraska, Utah and Washington \u2014 have switched to primaries for 2020 at the urging of the D.N.C. Six other states, including early-voting Iowa and Nevada, will continue to hold caucuses in 2020. Mrs. Clinton, whose 2008 presidential bid was upended by her third-place finish in Iowa, and who nearly lost the state to Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont in 2016, had long been a public skeptic of Iowa\u2019s show-up-to-caucus system. \u201cYou know, there were a lot of people who couldn\u2019t caucus tonight, despite the very large turnout,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said the night she lost the 2008 Iowa caucuses to Barack Obama. \u201cThere are a lot of people who work at night, people who are on their feet, people who are taking care of patients in a hospital, or waiting on a table in a restaurant, or maybe in a patrol car keeping our streets safe.\u201d A February poll from The Des Moines Register found that a virtual caucus could increase participation by a third. The Monmouth University Polling Institute found earlier this month that former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. increased his polling advantage in the state when the survey included Iowa Democrats who planned to participate in the virtual caucus. Democrats of all stripes remain shellshocked by Russian hacking that colored the 2016 election, which included the wide release of Clinton campaign emails and D.N.C. documents.",

His lawyer has been pressing the government in Kiev to investigate his political foes.By Kenneth P. VogelPRINT EDITIONU.S. House Opens Query  Into Trump\u2019s Handling Of Policies for Ukraine|September 10, 2019, Page A11",
      "author": "Kenneth P. Vogel",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 The White House delayed a package of military assistance to the new government in Ukraine, and has yet to schedule a White House meeting for its new president. After abruptly pulling the previous American ambassador out of Kiev when conservatives questioned her political loyalty, President Trump has yet to nominate a successor. Behind the scenes, Mr. Trump has told aides that he sees Ukraine as corrupt and suggested that he harbored a grudge from what he saw as that nation\u2019s support for Hillary Clinton in 2016. At a time when foreign policy experts and Mr. Trump\u2019s aides say strong support from the United States is especially important to Ukraine in its effort to fight corruption and stop further encroachment by Russia, Mr. Trump has left Ukrainians and some of his own allies uncertain about the degree of his commitment to the government of the newly elected president, Volodymyr Zelensky, according to interviews with people in both countries. The diplomatic strains come on top of concerns about efforts by Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, to press Mr. Zelensky\u2019s government to pursue investigations into two matters that date from the previous government and could be politically beneficial to Mr. Trump. One relates to involvement in Ukraine by former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his family. The other relates to accusations that Ukrainian government officials improperly aided Mrs. Clinton by seeking to sabotage Mr. Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign. On Monday, three House committees announced that they were opening a wide-ranging investigation into whether Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani were misappropriating the American foreign policy apparatus for political ends. In letters to the State Department and the White House, the chairmen of the House Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight Committees asserted that it would be \u201ca staggering abuse of power, a boon to Moscow and a betrayal of the public trust\u201d if Mr. Trump was withholding the military assistance to \u201cimproperly pressure the Ukrainian government to assist the president\u2019s bid for re-election.\u201d Across Washington\u2019s foreign policy community, there is broad optimism that Mr. Zelensky\u2019s government has a chance to finally put an end to twin scourges that have plagued Ukraine, a close American ally \u2014 corruption from inside and Russian incursions from the east. Publicly, Mr. Trump\u2019s administration has suggested that the hiccups in Ukrainian relations are more related to bureaucracy and logistics than to politics. In private, though, the president has been more adversarial, declaring in May that all Ukrainian politicians are \u201ccorrupt,\u201d and that the Ukrainian government \u201ctried to take me down,\u201d according to people familiar with an Oval Office briefing delivered by a United States government delegation that had recently returned from attending Mr. Zelensky\u2019s inauguration in Kiev. The delegation had been impressed by Mr. Zelensky, and had encouraged Mr. Trump to assist the new government. The White House did not respond to questions about the meeting. Vice President Mike Pence denied last week that the delay in releasing military assistance was in any way related to Mr. Giuliani\u2019s efforts to convince the Ukrainians to investigate matters related to the family of Mr. Biden, who is the early front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination. But, after a meeting with Mr. Zelensky on the sidelines of a commemoration of the outbreak of World War II, Mr. Pence said he and Mr. Trump \u201chave great concerns about issues of corruption.\u201d Without detailing those concerns, Mr. Pence linked them to the military assistance, telling reporters \u201cto invest additional taxpayer in Ukraine, the president wants to be assured that those resources are truly making their way to the kind of investments that will contribute to security and stability in Ukraine.\u201d Mr. Zelensky\u2019s office did not immediately respond to questions emailed after business hours in Kiev. But Senator Christopher S. Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat who serves on the Foreign Relations Committee and met with Mr. Zelensky last week, said the Ukrainian president, a political neophyte who had been a comedian before winning the presidency, seemed confused about why the assistance was being withheld. \u201cThe first question President Zelensky asked us was whether we knew anything about the security aid,\u201d Mr. Murphy said. \u201cThere seems to be very little understanding from anyone in the government as to why the aid has been withheld or what they need to do in order to get it released.\u201d Mr. Murphy said he urged Mr. Zelensky not to heed the requests from Mr. Giuliani, warning that to do so could threaten bipartisan support for Ukraine in Washington, which Mr. Murphy called Ukraine\u2019s \u201cmost important asset.\u201d It would be \u201cdisastrous for long-term U.S.-Ukraine relations,\u201d Mr. Murphy said, if Mr. Zelensky were seen as basing prosecutorial decisions on pressure from Mr. Trump\u2019s political allies. Mr. Murphy rejected the suggestion that his advice to Mr. Zelensky constituted meddling in Ukrainian affairs similar to Mr. Giuliani\u2019s efforts, which he had previously called \u201cprivate foreign policy engagement\u201d and into which he had sought an investigation. \u201cIf there are investigations that influence American politics one way or another, but the foundations of those investigations are based upon facts rather than political requests, I think that\u2019s legitimate,\u201d Mr. Murphy said. Mr. Giuliani on Monday welcomed the congressional investigation, asserting that he was acting \u201cat the request of the State Department and with the assistance of the State Department\u201d \u2014 a reference to communications with an aide to Mr. Zelensky that were brokered partly by Kurt D. Volker, the United States envoy to settlement talks in Ukraine\u2019s war with Russia. The Ukrainian aide, Andriy Yermak, a close ally of Mr. Zelensky, has said that it was not clear to him whether Mr. Giuliani was representing Mr. Trump in their talks. But Mr. Giuliani said he was acting only as Mr. Trump\u2019s private lawyer in those talks, during which he urged Mr. Yermak to pursue investigations. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t do it, I wouldn\u2019t be a good lawyer, I wouldn\u2019t be defending him,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said. \u201cThe Ukrainian government is uniquely situated to dig up facts that would vindicate my client.\u201d Mr. Giuliani has requested an inquiry into documents released during the 2016 campaign reflecting payments earmarked to Paul Manafort for earlier work in Ukraine. Mr. Manafort went on to become Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign chairman, but when The New York Times published a report including excerpts from the documents, it led to Mr. Manafort\u2019s resignation from the campaign. He has since pleaded guilty to charges brought by the special counsel related to his work in Ukraine, and is serving a seven-and-a-half-year prison sentence. Mr. Giuliani has questioned the authenticity of the documents, and suggested that an investigation into them could undermine the special counsel\u2019s investigation. He has also called for an investigation into the overlap between Mr. Biden\u2019s diplomacy in Ukraine and his son\u2019s involvement in a gas company owned by a Ukrainian oligarch. Mr. Trump has suggested that he would like Attorney General William P. Barr to look into both matters. In their letters to the White House and the State Department, the chairmen of the three House committees sought records related to the Biden and Manafort matters, and warned against linking the military assistance to the push for investigations of the matters. Representative Adam B. Schiff, a California Democrat who is the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, said in a statement that \u201cwhether or not this improper pressure is made explicitly, it cannot be lost on a country desperate for American military assistance that the president of the United States wants its government\u2019s help in his re-election campaign in the form of damaging information on his political opponent.\u201d",

      "author": "Lisa Lerer",
      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 When a reporter asked former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Saturday if he had spoken to his son Hunter about his work in Ukraine, Mr. Biden jabbed his finger repeatedly at the reporter and shot back: \u201cAsk the right questions.\u201d A few hours later, when coverage of President Trump\u2019s phone call to Ukraine\u2019s president about Mr. Biden and his son had reached a fever pitch, the Biden campaign emailed the news media to declare \u2014 in bold underlined words \u2014 that any story would be \u201cmisleading\u201d if it did not state upfront that Mr. Trump\u2019s claims were unsubstantiated. On Sunday night, the Biden campaign released a fund-raising appeal on Twitter asking, \u201cWill media see through Trump\u2019s sleazy playbook? Or fall for it again?\u201d And by Tuesday, the drumbeat of warnings to the press had grown so intense that even Lanny Davis, a longtime Democratic operative, weighed in, attacking \u201cinnuendo journalism.\u201d For the past three years, every Democratic campaign, politician and activist has operated in the shadow of Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 loss, caught in a cycle of self-recrimination and soul-searching about how to defend themselves against Mr. Trump and his Republican allies in 2020. It\u2019s a conversation that began in the hours after Mrs. Clinton\u2019s unexpected loss, as aides reckoned with their inability to defend her from Mr. Trump\u2019s conspiratorial accusations, and has continued ever since, with Mrs. Clinton herself dispensing advice in private conversations with Democratic primary candidates as they prepared to begin their campaigns. Now, Mr. Biden and his team think they have the answers. Among their conclusions: There are no guardrails. No one else will fight your battles. Responding to accusations from Mr. Trump and his allies \u2014 even to deny them \u2014 only gives them oxygen. And haranguing the referees in the media is a must. Former Senator Bill Nelson of Florida, who has endorsed Mr. Biden, has advanced the campaign\u2019s argument that the news media has a unique responsibility to provide the proper context for accusations being tossed around in the political arena \u2014 a duty he and other Biden backers say they failed to do in 2016. \u201cIn the old days when the truth was something that was respected and the press could be a source of the truth, that was one thing,\u201d said Mr. Nelson. \u201cNow when you have a player on the political stage that will say anything and has been shown to not tell the truth over and over and over, freedom of the press means that there is a new responsibility of the press.\u201d Former Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia, a Democrat who is unaligned in the primary, was even blunter: \u201cThe coverage of the emails was ridiculous,\u201d he said. \u201cIt gave Biden license to come out and say, \u2018Are you kidding me? We\u2019re not going through this again.\u2019\u201d Frank Sesno, a former broadcast journalist and the director of the School of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University, said ignoring questions about Hunter Biden altogether would be irresponsible journalism. \u201cI have not seen egregious, irresponsible reporting at all,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWhen the president of the United States says something publicly, you can\u2019t make that go away and no responsible news organization is going to ignore it.\u201d Senior aides on the Biden campaign argue that the Clinton campaign was not forceful enough in responding to the long drip of stories about her use of a private email server and the Clintons\u2019 family foundation. Those news reports, they argue, only helped to feed Mr. Trump\u2019s narrative that his rival was an untrustworthy creature of Washington. Rather than litigate the specifics in public, Biden aides and allies argue that Mrs. Clinton and her team should have focused more on privately shaming the media out of investigating allegations, while leaving Mrs. Clinton focused on attacking Mr. Trump and delivering her own message to voters. The allies spoke on condition of anonymity to disclose conversations about campaign strategy. \u201cDemocrats are very wary of a candidate being Hillary-ed going into 2020,\u201d said Zac Petkanas, the director of rapid response for Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign. Karen Finney, a former Clinton campaign spokeswoman who is unaligned in the 2020 race, said Democrats \u201cspent a lot more time talking about Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails than we should have, given some of the more glaringly troubling actions of Trump.\u201d Unlike Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Biden is unlikely to ever spend time diving into the details of the allegations, aides say, fearing that doing so would allow Mr. Trump\u2019s allegations to further hijack the national political conversation. Former Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack, who hosted a Biden campaign in his front yard but has yet to endorse any candidate for president, said, \u201cHe understands that you can\u2019t let something like this go.\u201d \u201cBut you have to be thoughtful about how you respond to it so that you don\u2019t let the president, with all of his capacity to impact folks like you to write what he says every day, to control the complete narrative,\u201d he added. Throughout the 2020 race, Mr. Biden has pitched himself as the strongest candidate to combat Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks. Whether combating Mr. Trump through the mainstream media proves correct will provide voters with a critical, real-time test of his strength, as allegations that Mr. Trump pressured the president of Ukraine to open a corruption investigation of Mr. Biden and his son Hunter are at the heart of a political firestorm that prompted Democrats on Tuesday to begin impeachment proceedings. Mr. Biden\u2019s rivals, too, are watching closely: While they have responded to the developments on Ukraine by denouncing Mr. Trump\u2019s actions, several camps are privately gaming out how they would handle a similar onslaught from the president and his allies. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to remember that they\u2019ll either find a vulnerability or they\u2019ll invent one for everybody,\u201d Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., told reporters traveling on his campaign bus. But even some opponents privately worry that this moment could elevate Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign if he handles it deftly, putting the former vice president on equal footing with the president and making it hard for his rivals to get their share of attention. \u201cTrump\u2019s lost it and he\u2019s terrified of Biden, and Biden\u2019s not going to take any of his guff at all,\u201d said Mr. McAuliffe. \u201cThis is actually good for Joe Biden. It puts him right at the forefront.\u201d There is no evidence so far to support Mr. Trump\u2019s claim that Mr. Biden improperly intervened to help his son\u2019s business in Ukraine. But that hasn\u2019t stopped the Trump campaign from pushing the allegations, giving Mr. Biden the nickname \u201cQuid Pro Joe.\u201d (Mr. Trump himself seems to be sticking with \u201cSleepy Joe.\u201d) During a fund-raiser in Baltimore on Tuesday night, Mr. Biden fired back with a moniker of his own: \u201cHe loves nicknames. I\u2019d like to give him a new nickname \u2014 former President Trump.\u201d Keeping the focus on beating Mr. Trump is an approach Mr. Biden has held since the final weeks of the 2016 campaign, when he urged the Clinton team during his weekly meetings with her staff to avoid debating topics like the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape. \u201cI said, \u2018I respectfully recommend she stand there and say, everybody knows who Donald Trump is, let me tell you what I\u2019m going to do for the country,\u2019 and not get into the debate, because it just drags it down,\u201d Mr. Biden told voters in New Hampshire earlier this month. The stories about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s email server and family foundation fed into an already existing narrative of corruption that Republicans had been pushing for decades; that is a challenge Mr. Biden does not face. For decades, he was consistently ranked one of the least wealthy members of the Senate. The allegations against Mr. Trump \u2014 that he used the power of his office to influence a foreign government to help him politically \u2014 are also far more serious than during the 2016 race. \u201cBiden doesn\u2019t have to answer for nothing,\u201d said James Carville, the Democratic strategist and longtime adviser to the Clintons. \u201cThere\u2019s one story here. The president of the United States tried to sic a foreign government on a political opponent.\u201d",

      "content": " In a moment that combined political theater and performance art, Hillary Clinton was reunited with her emails at an exhibition in Italy this week. And she wants Republicans to know it. \u201cSomeone alert the House G.O.P.,\u201d she wrote on Twitter on Thursday, captioning a picture of her seated with reams of paper that were part of \u201cHillary: The Hillary Clinton Emails,\u201d a work on display in the Despar Teatro Italia in Venice. On a replica of the desk in the Oval Office, which eluded her in 2016, were copies of some of the roughly 60,000 pages of emails that formed a central controversy during her presidential campaign. During her visit, Mrs. Clinton took a seat and started to thumb through the papers, said Kenneth Goldsmith, the American poet and artist behind the exhibition. In promotional materials, he called the emails \u201cthe most important political documents of our times.\u201d The email controversy followed Mrs. Clinton through much of the campaign, and was seized on particularly by her opponent, Donald J. Trump, and other Republicans. It centered on how she set up a private email account while she was secretary of state under President Barack Obama, and on her decision to destroy entries that she deemed to be personal. Classified information was found in a small number of the messages from her account. Mrs. Clinton, who left the State Department in 2013, was not charged based on the recommendation of James B. Comey, then the F.B.I. director, and she did not face disciplinary action. But the issue lingered until the end of the campaign, including an explosive revelation days before the election that new emails had been discovered, and Mr. Trump continued to insist that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s actions were \u201cbigger than Watergate\u201d and enough to put her in jail. (President Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, both White House aides, have since faced scrutiny over their handling of private communications.) After Mrs. Clinton\u2019s appearance at the exhibition, which was built into a balcony jutting out over a supermarket, she called the email episode one of the \u201cstrangest\u201d and most \u201cabsurd\u201d events in American political history. \u201cAnyone can go in and look at them,\u201d she said during remarks to the Italian news media. \u201cThere is nothing there.\u201d \u201cThere is nothing that should have been so controversial,\u201d she added. The exhibition opened on May 9 and runs through November 24 as part of the 58th Biennale of Visual Arts, which has served as a bellwether for the international art community since its establishment in 1895. It was put together by a team of curators called Francesco Urbano Ragazzi, which said in an emailed statement on Thursday that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s visit had been a surprise. \u201cWe were approached very informally by one of the closest friends of Hillary Clinton a few days before her visit,\u201d the curators said. The friend was planning a trip to the Biennale with Mrs. Clinton after she spoke at the Ambrosetti forum in Cernobbio. \u201cWe thought it was just a joke until Tuesday 9 a.m.,\u201d the curators said, \u201cwhen we saw the security services inside the exhibition space.\u201d In the exhibition, Mr. Goldsmith \u201cmakes public for the first time in printed format all the emails which, according to WikiLeaks, were sent from the domain clintonemail.com between 2009 and 2013,\u201d according to the promotional materials. \u201cThe pile of papers is rather unimpressive, rebutting Trump\u2019s efforts to make them monumental,\u201d the materials say. \u201cIn this way, Goldsmith creates the greatest poem of the 21st century, an anti-monument to the folly of Trump\u2019s heinous smear campaign against Clinton.\u201d",

Investigating Email Practices of Hillary Clinton\u2019s Former StaffThe inquiry is examining whether the employees used secure channels and the proper classification designations for what appeared to be routine emails at the time.By Edward Wong and Maggie HabermanPRINT EDITIONState Dept. Is Investigating Use of Email Under Clinton|September 30, 2019, Page A15",
      "author": "Edward Wong",
      "content": "  The State Department is continuing an investigation of email use among employees who worked for Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state, asking scores of current and former officials to submit to questioning by the bureau overseeing diplomatic security, former officials said on Sunday. The investigation is examining whether the employees used secure channels and the proper classification designations for what appeared to be routine emails at the time, the former officials said. The emails were on subjects that were not considered classified at the time, but that have been or are being retroactively marked as classified. The inquiry potentially pushes back into the spotlight a deeply political issue that President Trump used as a weapon in his 2016 presidential campaign, and has repeatedly returned to during his time in office, despite the F.B.I. closing a previous investigation without finding wrongdoing by Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Trump\u2019s insistence on raising the issue reflects a pattern in which the president pushes his own narrative even if an investigation or an analysis by an agency in his own administration has concluded otherwise. The emails were sent to Mrs. Clinton while she was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013, in President Barack Obama\u2019s administration. They appear to have come to the attention of the diplomatic security bureau during the earlier inquiries conducted by the State Department, Congress and the F.B.I. into Mrs. Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server. Those earlier investigations threw a long shadow over the 2016 presidential campaign and are considered by Mrs. Clinton and many analysts to be a factor in Mr. Trump\u2019s victory. The renewed focus on the emails was reported on Saturday by The Washington Post, which said as many as 130 officials had been contacted in recent weeks. Sometime soon after Mr. Trump took office and appointed Rex W. Tillerson as his first secretary of state, the department\u2019s diplomatic security bureau carried out the first stages of an investigation into email use by employees under Mrs. Clinton, the former officials said. Most of the people being investigated were political appointees who were leaving or had already left the department. The inquiry focused on the years when Mrs. Clinton was leading the State Department, even though many of the employees continued to work under her successor, John Kerry, the former officials said. The investigators appeared to want to finish the inquiry quickly and move on, the former officials said. At some point during Mr. Tillerson\u2019s tenure, people who had heard of the investigation thought it had ended because the diplomatic security bureau no longer appeared to be actively pursuing the question, the officials said. Mike Pompeo took over as secretary of state in April 2018, and in recent months the diplomatic security bureau has been interviewing current and former employees again about their email use under Mrs. Clinton, the former officials said. Before joining the Trump administration, Mr. Pompeo was a Republican member of the House, and served on the committee investigating the deadly raid on the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya. Mr. Pompeo was among those who aggressively questioned Mrs. Clinton. The Justice Department inquiry into her use of a private email server had its roots in that congressional investigation, which brought to light Mrs. Clinton\u2019s email practices. The former officials who described the current inquiry on Sunday did so on the condition of anonymity, given the sensitivity of the matter. The State Department did not reply to a request for comment on the current investigation. Looking to future prospects of the inquiry, the diplomatic security bureau could decide to make a formal note in a person\u2019s file saying he or she had mishandled classified information, according to the former officials. That could lead to that person being unable to get proper security clearances in the future, or the applicant might have to wait a long time for those clearances to be approved. The former officials said scrutinizing the employees over their handling of information that was not classified at the time, and only retroactively classified, was unusual. Also, many of those emails summarize conversations with foreign officials who themselves have no security clearance in the United States government, yet are engaged in discussions about topics of interest to American counterparts. Moreover, the former officials said, the State Department does not have much in the way of secure devices that employees can use to send material from the field, so employees often send emails that need to be urgently read by the secretary of state or other officials over unsecure lines. For example, a diplomat might be dashing off to catch a flight after a meeting and unable to get back to the embassy to send an email over secure equipment. In many cases, the emails that went to Mrs. Clinton were part of a long email chain created by officials forwarding emails to one another. In the Trump White House, at least seven senior officials, including the president\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, have used personal emails or chat apps to conduct official business. And congressional committees led by Democrats are now investigating the White House\u2019s handling of transcripts of Mr. Trump\u2019s calls with foreign leaders, including a particularly sensitive one in July with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, as part of an impeachment inquiry.",

Will the Supreme Court Stop Them?A new petition asks the justices to rule quickly, before the next election, on whether members of the Electoral College may vote their consciences.By Adam LiptakPRINT EDITIONJustices Are Asked: Can Electors Go Rogue?|October 15, 2019, Page A17",
      "author": "Adam Liptak",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 On Dec. 19, 2016, a little more than a month after the presidential election, members of the Electoral College gathered around the nation to cast their votes. Ten of them went rogue. A swing by that number of electors would have been enough to change the outcomes in five of the previous 58 presidential elections, according to a petition filed last week in the Supreme Court. In the 2000 election, after an assist from the Supreme Court, George W. Bush beat Al Gore by just five electoral votes. The petition asked the justices to decide whether \u201cfaithless electors\u201d were free to disregard pledges they made to vote for their own parties\u2019 candidates. It urged the court to act quickly. \u201cThis case permits the court to issue a decision outside of the white-hot scrutiny of a contested presidential election,\u201d the petition said. Deciding the issue in the context of an actual election could do lasting damage to the Supreme Court, said Lawrence Lessig, a law professor at Harvard who filed the petition on behalf of three Democratic electors from Washington State who were fined $1,000 each for casting their electoral votes for Colin L. Powell rather than for Hillary Clinton. A ruling that tipped an election to one or another candidate could not but look political, Professor Lessig said. \u201cIt would be disastrous for the institution,\u201d he said of the court, \u201cif they had to decide it in the middle of a presidential election.\u201d The Washington State Supreme Court upheld the fines in May, saying that the Constitution allows states to insist that electors vote for their parties\u2019 candidates. In dissent, Justice Steven C. Gonzalez disagreed. \u201cThe Constitution provides the state only with the power to appoint,\u201d he wrote, \u201cleaving the electors with the discretion to vote their conscience.\u201d Three months later, the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, in Denver, rejected the Washington State Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning. It said that Colorado had been wrong to discard a vote from a Democratic elector who had wanted to cast a ballot for Gov. John Kasich of Ohio. \u201cElectors, once appointed, are free to vote as they choose,\u201d Judge Carolyn B. McHugh wrote for the majority of a divided three-judge panel. \u201cWhile the Constitution grants the states plenary power to appoint their electors, it does not provide the states the power to interfere once voting begins, to remove an elector, to direct the other electors to disregard the removed elector\u2019s vote or to appoint a new elector to cast a replacement vote.\u201d Such sharp disagreements in the lower courts make a Supreme Court review more likely. So does the importance of the issue: It is hardly far-fetched that the next presidential election could turn on the votes of faithless electors. Two things are reasonably clear. The first is that the framers of the Constitution and the language they used seemed to contemplate that electors would use independent judgment. The second is that over time people have come to assume that electors are meant to vote for their parties\u2019 candidates. An 1892 Supreme Court decision captured this tension. \u201cDoubtless it was supposed that the electors would exercise a reasonable independence and fair judgment in the selection of the chief executive,\u201d Chief Justice Melville Fuller wrote. Over time, he added, \u201cthe original expectation may be said to have been frustrated.\u201d Alexander Hamilton described that original expectation in the Federalist Papers. \u201cMen chosen by the people for the special purpose\u201d of selecting the president, he wrote, \u201cwill be most likely to possess the information and discernment requisite to such complicated investigations.\u201d The Supreme Court these days is generally inclined to honor the original meaning of the Constitution, and the Tenth Circuit made a strong case that its language supports elector independence. The words of the relevant provisions, including \u201celector,\u201d \u201cvote\u201d and \u201cballot,\u201d Judge McHugh wrote, \u201chave a common theme: They all imply the right to make a choice or voice an individual opinion.\u201d On election night in 2016, the electoral vote was expected to be 306 for Donald J. Trump and 232 for Mrs. Clinton. In the end, though, it was 304 to 227. Seven electors succeeded in voting for other candidates. A fourth Democratic elector in Washington voted for Faith Spotted Eagle, and a Democratic elector in Hawaii voted for Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Republican electors in Texas voted for Mr. Kasich and Ron Paul, a former representative of Texas. Three more Democratic electors, in Colorado, Maine and Minnesota, tried to vote for candidates other than Mrs. Clinton. Two were replaced, and a third eventually came around. The number of faithless votes was the largest in history, but the phenomenon was not particularly unusual. \u201cCongress has accepted the vote of every vote contrary to a pledge or expectation in the nation\u2019s history that has been transmitted to it \u2014 a total of more than 150 votes across 20 different elections from 1796 to 2016,\u201d the petition filed last week said, citing data from FairVote, a nonpartisan voting rights advocacy group. Congress has only once debated the question, when some lawmakers objected in 1969 to counting a Republican elector\u2019s vote for George C. Wallace after Richard M. Nixon won the popular vote in the elector\u2019s state. Both houses rejected the objection, and the vote stood. Professor Lessig, the lawyer for the Washington State electors, said a decision in their favor could help focus public attention on the shortcomings of the Electoral College in reflecting the popular will. One response, he said, is the National Popular Vote plan, under which states agree to grant their electoral votes to the candidate who gets the most votes nationwide. \u201cIt could also convince both sides that it is finally time to step up and modify the Constitution to address this underlying problem,\u201d he said. One possibility, he said, is a constitutional amendment requiring a proportional allocation of electoral votes at the state level. The key point for now, Professor Lessig said, is to have a definitive answer on elector independence before the justices can know which candidate might benefit from their ruling. \u201cWhatever way you resolve it,\u201d he said, \u201cit should be resolved.\u201d",

Inquiry Into Clinton Emails Finds No Deliberate Mishandling of Classified InformationThe report appears to bookend a controversy that dogged Mrs. Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign.By Catie EdmondsonPRINT EDITIONQuiet Ending For Inquiry Into Emails And Server|October 19, 2019, Page A16",
      "author": "Catie Edmondson",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 A yearslong State Department investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server found that while the use of the system for official business increased the risk of compromising classified information, there was no systemic or deliberate mishandling of classified information. The inquiry, started more than three years ago, found that 38 current or former State Department officials were \u201cculpable\u201d of violating security procedures in a review of about 33,000 individual emails sent to or from the server that Mrs. Clinton turned over to investigators. The nine-page unclassified report, completed last month and shared with Congress this week, appears to bookend a controversy that dogged Mrs. Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign against Donald J. Trump. Mrs. Clinton blamed the F.B.I.\u2019s handling of the inquiry for crippling her campaign after James B. Comey, then the bureau\u2019s director, reopened his investigation into the server days before the general election after initially declining to bring charges. \u201cWhile there were some instances of classified information being inappropriately introduced into an unclassified system in furtherance of expedience,\u201d the report said, \u201cby and large, the individuals interviewed were aware of security policies and did their best to implement them in their operations.\u201d The report concluded, \u201cThere was no persuasive evidence of systemic, deliberate mishandling of classified information.\u201d A representative for Mrs. Clinton declined on Friday to comment on the report. State Department investigators reviewed thousands of pages of documents, sent from 2009 to 2013, when Mrs. Clinton served in the Obama administration. The emails were on subjects that were not considered classified at the time, but that have been or were retroactively marked as classified. Investigators also took statements from hundreds of past and present department officials, and interviewed dozens more, according to the report. The focus of the investigation, according to the report, was to determine if any of the emails \u201crepresented a failure to properly safeguard classified information,\u201d and if so, if any specific individuals could be determined to bear responsibility. It is unclear whether any of the 38 officials the report found culpable of violating security procedures still work at the State Department. The office overseeing diplomatic security would make a note in the file of employees or former employees found to have violated those procedures, and those who have left government could have a harder time receiving security clearances if they apply for a government job again. The use of a private email system \u201cdid not necessarily\u201d increase the likelihood of classified information being transmitted on unclassified systems, investigators concluded, but it did add \u201can increased degree of risk of compromise.\u201d The report was released this week by Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, who began investigating Mrs. Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server in 2017, when he served as the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Not included in the review were emails deleted by Mrs. Clinton after her lawyers advised that they were private and not related to official business. House Republicans discovered the use of the private server, which Mrs. Clinton said she used out of convenience, as part of an investigation into the deaths of Americans in Benghazi, Libya. It prompted Congress, the F.B.I. and the State Department to initiate separate investigations. Some Republicans, led by Mr. Trump, have continued to use the issue to attack Mrs. Clinton and Democrats, even though the F.B.I. closed a previous investigation without bringing charges against Mrs. Clinton, Critics have accused State Department officials who took up the investigation of political bias. Mr. Trump\u2019s own administration officials \u2014 including his daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner \u2014 have admitted to using private messaging services to conduct official work. House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry has revealed that Trump administration diplomats used private phones to message each other about their efforts to pressure Ukrainian officials to investigate the president\u2019s American political rivals, including the Bidens.",

Sherrod Brown? Michelle Obama?By Jonathan MartinPRINT EDITIONAnxious Democrats Ask, \u2018Is There Anybody Else?\u2019|October 23, 2019, Page A11",
      "author": "Jonathan Martin",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 When a half-dozen Democratic donors gathered at the Whitby Hotel in Manhattan last week, the dinner began with a discussion of which presidential candidates the contributors liked. But as conversations among influential Democrats often go these days, the meeting quickly evolved into a discussion of who was not in the race \u2014 but could be lured in. Would Hillary Clinton get in, the contributors wondered, and how about Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York mayor? One person even mused whether Michelle Obama would consider a late entry, according to two people who attended the event, which was hosted by the progressive group American Bridge. It\u2019s that time of the election season for Democrats. \u201cSince the last debate, just anecdotally, I\u2019ve had five or six people ask me: \u2018Is there anybody else?\u2019\u201d said Leah Daughtry, a longtime Democrat who has run two of the party\u2019s recent conventions. With doubts rising about former Vice President Joseph R. Biden\u2019s ability to finance a multistate primary campaign, persistent questions about Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s viability in the general election and skepticism that Mayor Pete Buttigieg, of South Bend, Ind., can broaden his appeal beyond white voters, Democratic leaders are engaging in a familiar rite: fretting about who is in the race and longing for a white knight to enter the contest at the last minute. It is a regular, if not quite quadrennial, tradition for a party that can be fatalistic about its prospects and recalls similar Maalox moments Democrats endured in 1992, 2004 and in the last primary, when it was Mr. Biden who nearly entered the race in October. But the mood of alarm is even more intense because of the party\u2019s hunger to defeat President Trump and \u2014 with just over three months to go before voting starts in Iowa \u2014 their impatience with finding Mr. or Mrs. Right among the current crop of candidates. \u201cThere\u2019s more anxiety than ever,\u201d said Connie Schultz, a journalist who is married to Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, another Democrat who some in the party would like to see join the race. \u201cWe\u2019re both getting the calls. I\u2019ve been surprised by some who\u2019ve called me.\u201d \u201cI can see it, I can feel it, I can hear it,\u201d Mitch Landrieu, the former New Orleans mayor, said of the unease within the party. He said he thinks Mr. Biden is best positioned to defeat Mr. Trump but called the former vice president\u2019s fund-raising \u201ca real concern.\u201d Mr. Biden\u2019s lackluster debate performances and alarmingly low cash flow \u2014 he has less than $9 million on hand, not even half of some of his rivals \u2014 has fueled the Democratic disquiet. But if the causes of the concern are plain to see, what exactly can be done about it is less clear. And even some of those being wooed acknowledge that it can be hard to discern between people just being nice and those who genuinely want them in the race. Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Bloomberg have both told people privately in recent weeks that if they thought they could win, they would consider entering the primary \u2014 but that they were skeptical there would be an opening, according to Democrats who have spoken with them. Former Secretary of State John F. Kerry, who associates say has wondered aloud about whether he should have run and has found it hard to watch Mr. Biden\u2019s missteps, has also been urged to get in. But he still thinks the former vice president, who was once his longtime Senate colleague, is the party\u2019s best nominee. Another Obama administration official who weighed a campaign at the start of the year, former Attorney General Eric Holder, is considering a last-minute entry but has conceded it may be too late, according to a Democrat familiar with his thinking. Mr. Brown, who nearly entered the race earlier this year, said the pressure on him to reconsider from labor leaders, Democratic officials and donors has \u201cbecome more frequent.\u201d And Deval Patrick, the former Massachusetts governor, who also weighed a campaign run before deciding not to, said he too has been nudged by friends to reconsider. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to be rumored about,\u201d he said, before notably refusing to rule out a last-minute entry. \u201cDon\u2019t ask me that question,\u201d he said. But Mr. Patrick suggested an 11th-hour bid was highly unlikely and had a message for increasingly angst-ridden Democrats: \u201cEverybody needs to calm down, it\u2019s early. It\u2019s so early.\u201d The chances that another major contender decides to run are remote: While Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Bloomberg have both been encouraged to enter the race, Democrats close to them believe the only scenario under which they\u2019d consider running is if Mr. Biden drops out or is badly weakened. Neither is likely to take place before the end of this calendar year, at which point the filing deadline to be on the primary ballot in large Super Tuesday states like California and Texas will have passed. But that\u2019s not stopping the speculation, which has only grown of late thanks in part to the 2016 Democratic nominee\u2019s public comments. Mrs. Clinton, after largely staying in the  background of the Democratic primary, has been more vocal this month, promoting a book she wrote with her daughter and taunting Mr. Trump on Twitter. She also opened a feud with Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii by claiming the long-shot candidate was being supported by the Russians, as a potential third-party spoiler in the general election. Democrats who have recently spoken with Mrs. Clinton say she shares the same concerns other party elites have about the field \u2014 worried about Mr. Biden\u2019s durability, Ms. Warren\u2019s liberal politics and unsure of who else can emerge to take on Mr. Trump. But these people, who spoke anonymously to discuss private conversations, say she enjoys the freedom that comes with not being on the ballot.\n\nMr. Bloomberg is said to be more eager to find a way into the race \u2014 and chatter about his potential candidacy has only grown among Democrats who work on Wall Street and are concerned about Ms. Warren\u2019s rise. He raised some eyebrows recently by putting off a fund-raising request from one third-party Democratic group until he knew about his own intentions, according to two Democrats familiar with the conversation. But the former New York mayor has flirted with presidential runs before, only to pull back. Friends say he recognizes his long odds at this stage of the race and his advisers suggest he will play a significant financial role in the 2020 race without his name on the ballot. Still, it\u2019s unlikely that the what-if musing, particularly among the party\u2019s class of donors, elected officials and strategists, will quiet down as long as Mr. Biden is struggling and Ms. Warren, the Massachusetts senator, is surging. \u201cWith Trump looming, there is genuine concern that the horse many have bet on may be pulling up lame and the horse who has sprinted out front may not be able to win,\u201d said David Axelrod, a former adviser to President Barack Obama.\n\nWhile much of the daydreaming about a last-minute entry comes from pro-business Democrats, it is not confined to the wealthy. Mr. Brown and Ms. Schultz noted that they were hearing from a broad range of people but declined to offer any names. He said he was staying out of the race and had no regrets. The Ohio senator said he was confident Democrats would eventually rally behind their nominee, but he warned the party not to embrace a single-payer health care plan that eliminates private insurance. \u201cI think it\u2019ll be a hard sell to the public if we go into the general election for \u2018Medicare for all,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Brown, citing the risk of alienating union workers who would lose their negotiated plans. One longtime Democrat who originally sought to entice Mr. Brown into the race, Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, could not help letting out a loud \u201coy!\u201d when asked about the possibility of another candidate joining the sprawling field. \u201cFor as long as I have been in politics, I\u2019ve heard Democrats fretting about their presidential contenders,\u201d said Ms. Weingarten. Indeed, for some Democrats, the grass is always greener outside their field. There were multiple stages of the 1992 primary when Bill Clinton\u2019s candidacy was seen as doomed, either because of his own vulnerabilities or because of the third-party threat of H. Ross Perot. Would-be Democratic saviors that year included Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York, former Senators Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, Sam Nunn of Georgia and Al Gore of Tennessee, and Representative Richard Gephardt of Missouri. In the 2004 race, Mr. Gore was again sought after as a potential candidate. That race evolved along similar lines to the current primary, with Democrats desperate to oust an incumbent Republican (George W. Bush) but nervous that their front-runner into the fall (Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont) would prove unelectable as the nominee. That time, a candidate did come in relatively late in the race, Wesley K. Clark, a retired general, but he gained little traction and Mr. Kerry ultimately won the nomination. At this time four years ago, it was Mr. Biden who some Democrats were hoping would join the race to offer the party another option besides Mrs. Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Mr. Biden, of course, decided not to run. But now it\u2019s his own candidacy that\u2019s prompting a familiar call for the cavalry, or at least one horse-bound white knight. \u201cIf Biden were surging, I doubt you would be hearing this,\u201d said Harold Ickes, a longtime Democratic consultant. \u201cThis shows a restlessness among a lot of people.\u201d",

Last Friday, Hillary Clinton suggested that Republicans were \u201cgrooming\u201d her for such a bid, though Ms. Gabbard has denied any such plans.

She failed to qualify for the party\u2019s September debate, but then met a 2 percent polling threshold for the Oct. 15 debate, where she assailed the news media for what she called biased coverage of her campaign. Ms. Gabbard, 38, who served as a soldier in Iraq and is a major in the Hawaii Army National Guard, has made foreign policy the main focus of her presidential campaign, promising to get and keep the United States out of foreign wars if elected.

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Paul Manafort, President Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, spread a conspiracy theory now at the center of the impeachment investigation \u2014 that Ukraine, not Russia, hacked the Democratic National Committee \u2014 as early as five months before the 2016 election, according to newly released documents from the special counsel\u2019s investigation. Mr. Manafort told his deputy on the campaign about the theory shortly after emails stolen from the Democrats were published in June 2016, and questions arose about whether Russia hacked the emails to help the Trump campaign, according to the documents. The documents have no information about when Mr. Trump embraced the conspiracy theory, which he later asked Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate in a July 25 phone call even as he was withholding military aid for the country. Those revelations helped touch off the impeachment inquiry. The details of what Mr. Manafort told campaign officials are included in a trove of records from the special counsel\u2019s investigation obtained by BuzzFeed News through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit. The documents \u2014 including F.B.I. interview reports with several key witnesses and emails of Mr. Trump\u2019s top campaign officials \u2014 contain few startling details that were not in the report by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, but they underscore the notion that Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign eagerly welcomed Russia\u2019s help in the election and show how concerned campaign officials were about being tied to Russia. The documents also provide new insights into how the Fox News personality Sean Hannity played a role in Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and how Mr. Manafort remained involved in helping Mr. Trump long after he was fired in August 2016. \u201cI am really feeling good about our prospects on Tuesday and focusing on preserving the victory,\u201d Mr. Manafort said in an email to Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, three days before the election. \u201cThis memo deals with this concern.\u201d Mr. Manafort, who was removed as the campaign\u2019s chairman after questions arose about his business ties to Ukraine and is now in prison for financial crimes associated with his work there, told Mr. Kushner that he had briefed the deputy campaign chairman, Rick Gates, and Mr. Hannity on the memo. Mr. Kushner forwarded the email to Mr. Trump\u2019s top campaign strategist, Stephen K. Bannon. \u201cWe need to avoid this guy like the plague,\u201d Mr. Bannon said. \u201cPaul is a nice guy but can\u2019t let word get out he is advising us.\u201d Mr. Bannon added, \u201cThey are going to try to say the Russians worked with WikiLeaks to give this victory to us.\u201d The account of how Mr. Manafort first raised the prospect that Ukraine had been behind the hack was included in an F.B.I. report about an interview the special counsel\u2019s office did with Mr. Gates in April 2018. Mr. Gates said Mr. Manafort\u2019s theory echoed one that had been pushed by a Ukrainian businessman who had worked with Mr. Manafort and Mr. Gates when they consulted for the government there years earlier. Mr. Mueller\u2019s office has said that the Ukrainian businessman, Konstantin V. Kilimnik, has ties to Russian intelligence. \u201cGates recalled Manafort saying the hack was likely carried out by the Ukrainians, not the Russians, which parroted a narrative Kilimnik often supported,\u201d according to the F.B.I. interview report. \u201cKilimnik also opined the hack could have been perpetrated by Russian operatives in Ukraine.\u201d It is unclear when Mr. Trump embraced the theory. In April 2017, just three months into his presidency, he first raised the issue publicly, questioning how the F.B.I. conducted its investigation into the hack and why agents declined to take the server from the Democrats to more closely examine who breached it. The Democrats \u201cget hacked, and the F.B.I. goes to see them, and they won\u2019t let the F.B.I. see their server,\u201d Mr. Trump told The Associated Press. \u201cThey brought in another company that I hear is Ukrainian-based,\u201d Mr. Trump said in an apparent reference to a company the Democrats brought in to investigate the hack. \u201cThat\u2019s what I heard. I heard it\u2019s owned by a very rich Ukrainian.\u201d Mr. Gates laid out for investigators how determined Mr. Trump appeared to be during the campaign to find emails from Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email account and how Mr. Trump told his aides that he wanted them to \u201cget the emails.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s top national security aide on the campaign, Michael T. Flynn, \u201csaid he could use his intelligence sources to obtain the emails,\u201d Mr. Gates told investigators. Mr. Flynn told campaign officials that the American intelligence agencies would be unable to determine who was behind the hack, Mr. Gates said, adding that he believed Mr. Flynn had a negative view of the agencies because he had been pushed out of the intelligence community during the Obama administration. \u201cGates said Flynn had the most Russia contacts of anyone on the campaign and was in the best position to ask for the emails if they were out there,\u201d according to Mr. Gates\u2019s F.B.I. interview report. Mr. Trump fired Mr. Flynn less than a month into his presidency. In 2017, Mr. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to F.B.I. agents about his contacts with the Russian ambassador during the transition, and he is awaiting sentencing. Mr. Gates said Mr. Trump and Mr. Kushner had initially been skeptical about working with the Republican National Committee. But Mr. Gates said that they became more interested in collaborating after learning that the committee wanted to help amplify the emails that WikiLeaks planned to release. Mr. Gates said that the committee had private information that indicated it knew the timing of upcoming email disclosures. \u201cGates did not specify who at the R.N.C. knew this information,\u201d according to the documents. \u201cGates said the only nonpublic information the R.N.C. had related to the timing of the releases.\u201d The Republican National Committee said in a statement that Mr. Gates\u2019s claims were false. \u201cThe R.N.C. had no advanced knowledge. Gates has already pled guilty to lying to federal authorities,\u201d said the committee\u2019s communications director, Michael Ahrens. \u201cWhy would anyone believe him now?\u201d",

      "author": "Adam Liptak",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 President Bill Clinton, who put Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Supreme Court in 1993, joined the justice on Wednesday for a public conversation. So did Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state, who might have named Justice Ginsburg\u2019s eventual successor had she won the 2016 presidential election. The conversation, at Georgetown University Law Center, focused on what the participants said was a radical change in federal judicial nominations. Mrs. Clinton, without naming names, said the Trump administration has been appointing unqualified judges. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen people largely chosen on the basis of age, and therefore longevity, and political ideology being pushed through despite having no relevant experience,\u201d she said. \u201cBefore the last several years people took seriously the selection of judges. Even if they were trying to find somebody who would get to the result they wanted, they wanted to be able to say that this was a distinguished lawyer, that this was a judge with experience.\u201d By contrast, Mr. Clinton said, he was taken by Justice Ginsburg\u2019s career as a pathbreaking women\u2019s rights litigator when he was considering her for the Supreme Court. He said he was also struck by her forthrightness when they met in 1993 for an interview. \u201cI knew after about 10 minutes that I was going to give her the job,\u201d he said. They discussed abortion, Mr. Clinton said. Justice Ginsburg, then a federal appeals court judge, had been critical of aspects of Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that established a constitutional right to abortion. The Supreme Court had moved too fast, Justice Ginsburg wrote in 1992. It would have sufficed, she wrote, to strike down the extreme Texas law at issue in the case and then proceed in measured steps in later cases to consider other abortion restrictions. Mr. Clinton said Judge Ginsburg talked freely about all of this. \u201cShe made a heck of a case,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were just two people alone, and she was telling me what she honestly thought.\u201d He recalled thinking, he said, that \u201cthis woman is completely on the level.\u201d Justice Ginsburg, now 86, was 60 when she was nominated. \u201cSome people thought I was too old for the job,\u201d she said. \u201cNow I\u2019m into my 27th year on the court and am one of the longest-tenured justices. So if you worried about my age, it was unnecessary.\u201d Justice Ginsburg\u2019s appearance with the Clintons was part of her remarkably busy public schedule since the Supreme Court announced in August that she had been treated for pancreatic cancer. That was Justice Ginsburg\u2019s fourth brush with cancer, after surgery in December to remove two malignant nodules from her left lung, surgery for early-stage pancreatic cancer in 2009 and treatment for colon cancer in 1999. Some liberals had hoped she would retire under President Barack Obama, but she stayed on, indicating that she expected a Democrat to succeed him. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be another Democratic president,\u201d Justice Ginsburg told The Washington Post in 2013. \u201cThe Democrats do fine in presidential elections; their problem is they can\u2019t get out the vote in the midterm elections.\u201d President Trump, whose election proved her wrong, has been critical of Justice Ginsburg, saying in 2016 that \u201cher mind is shot\u201d and suggesting that she resign. His sharp words came after Justice Ginsburg criticized Mr. Trump in a series of interviews. She later said she had made a mistake in publicly commenting on a candidate and promised to be more \u201ccircumspect\u201d in the future. In 1993, she was confirmed by a vote of 96 to 3. \u201cOur Senate was working the way it should and the way I hope it will again in my lifetime,\u201d Justice Ginsburg said on Wednesday. Mrs. Clinton said one thing had surprised her in the intervening years. \u201cI always knew Justice Ginsburg would be a great Supreme Court justice,\u201d she said. \u201cI did not know she would be a really popular cultural icon.\u201d Mrs. Clinton said she had given her husband \u201cThe R.B.G. Workout,\u201d a book on the justice\u2019s exercise routine. Both Clintons said they had completed the workout, but at a cost. \u201cIt was a problem,\u201d Mr. Clinton said. \u201cIt was a real struggle.\u201d",

But it can give us the perspectives of some of the people with expertise on primary races: veteran campaign strategists, consultants and advocates from both parties. Here is a sampling of their reactions. Senator Kamala Harris of California, trying to stop her campaign\u2019s slide, got perhaps her best reviews since the first debate in June \u2014 the one that shot her up in the polls for a few weeks. Commentators were not unanimous on Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., \u2014 who has risen to or near the top of recent polls, especially in Iowa \u2014 but for the most part, they thought he did well under the increased scrutiny. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota earned praise for several responses, but most prominently her defense of her argument that she and the other women running would struggle to win support with Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s level of political experience. And Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey did well against former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts had the most speaking time of any candidate but did not make the biggest impression. But strategists and commentators generally said she and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont did what they needed to do to maintain their positions in the race, and both of them had standout moments \u2014 especially on impeachment for Ms. Warren and climate change for Mr. Sanders. In what has become a pattern, Mr. Biden drew good marks for his responses on foreign policy \u2014 consistently a strong point for him in debates \u2014 but groans for his responses on race.",

      "author": "Maggie Astor",
      "content": " Hillary Clinton waded into the Democratic primary on Friday by suggesting that Russia was backing Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii for president and that Republicans were \u201cgrooming\u201d her as a third-party candidate. In response, Ms. Gabbard lashed out late in the afternoon with an extraordinary series of tweets in which she called Mrs. Clinton \u201cthe queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long.\u201d Ms. Gabbard has said in the past that she will not run as a third-party candidate, and she repeated that in an interview with NBC on Friday night. Mrs. Clinton made her allegation on \u201cCampaign HQ,\u201d a podcast hosted by David Plouffe, a former aide to President Barack Obama. \u201cI\u2019m not making any predictions,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I think they\u2019ve got their eye on somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate. She\u2019s the favorite of the Russians. They have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far.\u201d She did not name Ms. Gabbard in that interview, but her target was clear. Nick Merrill, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, told NBC News, \u201cif the nesting doll fits,\u201d when he was asked to confirm that Mrs. Clinton had been referring to Ms. Gabbard. Disinformation experts have noted frequent mentions of Ms. Gabbard by RT, the Kremlin-backed news agency, and apparent Twitter bot activity amplifying pro-Gabbard messages and hashtags. Mr. Merrill said late Friday evening that Mrs. Clinton\u2019s initial \u201cgrooming\u201d claim had referred to Republicans, not Russia, as initially reported. Mrs. Clinton then brought up Russia in the podcast interview, saying Ms. Gabbard was the Kremlin\u2019s preferred candidate. Mr. Merrill told CNN earlier in the day: \u201cIf the Russian propaganda machine, both their state media and their bot and troll operations, is backing a candidate aligned with their interests, that is just a reality. It is not speculation.\u201d On Twitter, Mr. Merrill mocked Ms. Gabbard by referencing President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, whom Ms. Gabbard has defended. Ms. Gabbard is averaging less than 1 percent in the polls but qualified for this week\u2019s Democratic debate, where she promoted her noninterventionist foreign policy platform and attacked the news media for what she said was bias against her.",

      "author": "Liam Stack",
      "content": " Speaking at the funeral of Representative Elijah E. Cummings, former President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state, offered a forceful defense of democracy and compared the late congressman, a leader in the impeachment inquiry into President Trump, to the prophet Elijah. \u201cLike that Old Testament prophet, he stood against the corrupt leadership of King Ahab and Queen Jezebel,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said, to a roar of applause from the congregation. \u201cAnd he looked out for the vulnerable among us. He lifted up the next generation of leaders. And he even worked a few miracles.\u201d Mr. Cummings, a Maryland Democrat who was serving his 13th term in the House of Representatives, died last week in Baltimore at 68. As chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, he earned the ire of Mr. Trump for his support of impeachment and investigations into the president\u2019s finances. Mr. Trump did not attend the funeral. Even from his hospital bed, Mr. Cummings was said to be joining impeachment strategy discussions with colleagues. Mrs. Clinton alluded to that determination, even in his final days, in her remarks on Friday. \u201cToward the end of his life, he said, \u2018I am begging the American people to pay attention to what is going on, because if you want to have a democracy intact for your children, and your children\u2019s children, and generations yet unborn, we have got to guard this moment,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201c\u2018This is our watch.\u2019\u201d She added: \u201c\u2018When we are dancing with the angels, the question will be asked,\u2019 he said, \u2018In 2019, what did we do to make sure we kept our democracy intact?\u2019\u201d Mr. Cummings\u2019s body lay in state in the Capitol on Thursday, where he was praised by lawmakers from both parties. It appears he is the first African-American lawmaker to receive that honor. Mr. Clinton pointed to Mr. Cummings\u2019s bipartisan friendships as proof of his commitment to a free and diverse society. \u201cNo matter how hard he fought or how passionately he argued, he tried to treat everyone the way he wanted to be treated,\u201d Mr. Clinton said. \u201cThe way he thought Americans should be treated. You can\u2019t run a free society if you have to hate everybody you disagree with.\u201d In addition to Mr. and Mrs. Clinton, other prominent politicians who spoke at his funeral were former President Barack Obama, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator and presidential candidate. \u201cElijah wrote his funeral program and decided who he wanted to do what,\u201d Bishop Walter Scott Thomas, the pastor, said after Ms. Warren and Representative Marcia Fudge, Democrat of Ohio, read from the Bible. \u201cSome of you may be wondering why you are not doing anything, so I wanted to give you clarity.\u201d The funeral was held at New Psalmist Baptist Church in Baltimore, where Mr. Cummings could usually be seen seated in the front row on Sundays. The church seats 4,000 people, but was expected to draw far more for the funeral on Friday. \u201cI love this man,\u201d Mr. Clinton said, gesturing toward the coffin. \u201cI loved every minute I ever spent with him, every conversation I ever had with him. I loved his booming voice. But we should hear him now at the quiet times of night, when we get worried, and we get discouraged, and we don\u2019t know if we can believe anymore.\u201d Again referring to the story of the prophet Elijah, Mr. Clinton said Americans should remember Mr. Cummings as \u201ca still, small voice that keeps us going, keeps us grateful, keeps us happy and keeps us moving.\u201d Mr. Cummings was raised in Baltimore by parents who were former sharecroppers in South Carolina. He graduated from Howard University in Washington, earned a law degree at the University of Maryland and was first elected to Congress in 1996. Mr. Cummings used his power as the chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform to mount muscular investigations of the Trump administration. In the past year, Mr. Cummings issued subpoenas for Mr. Trump\u2019s financial records (the president sued him in response) and summoned the president\u2019s former lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, to testify about hush money payments to women who claimed to have had an affair with Mr. Trump. In an interview with The New York Times in May, Mr. Cummings urged the president to commit his life to public service. \u201cI want to send a message that we have one life to live, Mr. President,\u201d he replied. \u201cThis is no dress rehearsal. And that the American people simply want to live their lives without fear of their leaders. And we, as leaders, have a duty and a responsibility to keep our promise to them when we ran for office and won \u2014 and that is to make their lives better. While we\u2019re all on this earth, that\u2019s my message.\u201d After his first election, he never faced a serious primary or general election challenge. He was revered in his district, and widely respected on Capitol Hill, for his integrity and moral vision, which Mrs. Clinton alluded to in her remarks. She called him \u201ca fierce champion for truth, justice and kindness in every part of his life.\u201d \u201cHis integrity and character, his can-do spirit, made him a guiding light in the Congress,\u201d she said. \u201cHe pushed back against the abuse of power. He was unwavering in his defense of our democracy. He had little tolerance for those who put party ahead of country or partisanship above truth.\u201d",

      "author": "Lisa Lerer",
      "content": " Sign up here to get On Politics in your inbox. Is Hillary Clinton trolling us? Over the past two weeks, Mrs. Clinton has called President Trump a \u201ccorrupt human tornado.\u201d She\u2019s refused to appear on a panel with Kirstjen Nielsen, the former homeland security secretary best known for separating migrant children from their families. She\u2019s picked a fight with Representative Tulsi Gabbard, suggesting that the Hawaii congresswoman and presidential candidate is a favorite of the Russians. And she\u2019s tweeted a letter mocking Mr. Trump with language that makes it unprintable in this family newsletter. Welcome to Hillary Unplugged. For most of her public career, Mrs. Clinton has been constrained by the expectations of her position, be it first lady, senator or secretary of state. Now, after her stunning loss in 2016, it seems she finally feels liberated to speak her mind. And she\u2019s certainly stirring up a lot of drama while doing it. The two-time Democratic presidential candidate continues to loom large in the psyche of her party \u2014 both as heroine and villain. Some Democrats celebrate seeing Mrs. Clinton giving zero, uh, cares. Others, like Ms. Gabbard, see her criticism as a different kind of badge of honor. Several people who have spoken to Ms. Gabbard say privately that her team loves the controversy, seeing Mrs. Clinton as a perfect establishment foil for their stuck-in-the-single-digits campaign. Mrs. Clinton is back in the news cycle because she\u2019s been promoting a new book written with her daughter, Chelsea. The fact that her book tour coincided with impeachment proceedings in the House (something Mrs. Clinton knows a little about, given her role in both of the past two impeachments) was just good \u2014 or depending on your view, bad \u2014 timing. \u201cShe has a unique and well-informed perspective,\u201d said Karen Finney, a Democratic strategist and former Clinton aide. \u201cI want to hear from her.\u201d But Mrs. Clinton\u2019s return to the spotlight comes as a number of Democratic Party officials \u2014 including some major donors, activists and black pastors in early voting states \u2014 are privately wondering whether she should jump into the primary race. Publicly, Mrs. Clinton isn\u2019t doing much to tamp down the speculation: \u201cMaybe there does need to be a rematch. Obviously, I can beat him again,\u201d she said in an interview on PBS this month, referring to her victory over Mr. Trump in the popular vote. People who have spoken to Mrs. Clinton say she remains \u201cwistful\u201d about the idea of a third presidential run, though she has not taken steps to actually mount a bid and remains unlikely to do so. Instead, she\u2019s offered advice to nearly everyone in the Democratic field \u2014 save for her former primary rival, Senator Bernie Sanders, and Ms. Gabbard. She has a friendly relationship with Senator Elizabeth Warren, last speaking with her in early September, and remains in regular touch with former Vice President Joe Biden. Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Senator Cory Booker have reached out repeatedly. She has no plans to make an endorsement in the primary, say those close to her. But, as her supporters argue, why should she stay silent \u2014 particularly given the strangeness of our political times? After all, former Secretary of State John Kerry, the 2004 Democratic nominee, has also flirted with running for president again. And Senator Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee, admits to being a \u201clurker\u201d in online political discourse, with a secret Twitter account under the name Pierre Delecto. (\u201cC\u2019est moi,\u201d Mr. Romney told The Atlantic last night, after Slate exposed him.) Mrs. Clinton, at least, trolls under her own name. Mrs. Clinton isn\u2019t the only Democrat facing calls to run for office. Oprah Winfrey wants Bob Iger, Disney\u2019s chief executive, to jump into the race. We\u2019d love to hear from you. Are you afflicted with your own case of the what ifs? Whom would you like to see run for president? Or is the current field just fine, thank you very much? Let us know and we might feature your comments in a future newsletter! Email us at onpolitics@nytimes.com (please include your name and hometown if you\u2019d like them to be included). Our colleague Matt Stevens explains: First, a bit of back story. At Tuesday night\u2019s debate, moderators asked the Democratic presidential candidates about a friendship that might surprise people. Andrew Yang said he\u2019d befriended a trucker and former Trump supporter named Fred. The two men drove around in Fred\u2019s truck for hours, Mr. Yang said, and eventually, Fred came around to support Mr. Yang for the nomination. My colleagues \u2014 and probably more than a few people watching at home \u2014 were skeptical about this \u201cFred.\u201d Was Fred about as real as Pierre Delecto? \u201cWho will interview Fred?\u201d your newsletter host, Ms. Lerer, wrote in our live chat during the debate. \u201cFind Fred!\u201d Well, it turns out Fred found us. And I interviewed him \u2014 first briefly by phone and then later with questions we sent by email at his request. (Fred wanted to coordinate with the communications director for the group \u201cTruckers for Yang.\u201d More on that later.) Fred \u2014 his full name is Fred Ramey \u2014 told me that he \u201chad a rough background as a kid\u201d and at one point spent time in prison. Now he coaches felons and drug addicts. Mr. Ramey, 43, of Maricopa, Ariz., said he was put in touch with Mr. Yang earlier this year by a friend who was also a trucker, and at first he resisted the idea of driving around with a politician. Then he listened to Mr. Yang discuss the threat of automation, which Mr. Yang says could put millions of truckers out of work. He came to like him. But he still worried about whether he could support a Democrat. \u201cThen I had this moment of clarity,\u201d Mr. Ramey said. \u201cI either need to live my values or get new ones.\u201d So they got in the truck. And Mr. Ramey said he \u201ctried to do everything I could to offend\u201d Mr. Yang. He pressed the candidate on whether he would \u201cpander.\u201d Did Mr. Yang even know what he was getting himself into? \u201cHe took every negative I threw at him and turned it into a positive,\u201d Mr. Ramey said. \u201cI just needed to know that the candidate I now 100 percent believe in is a real person with real solutions for America.\u201d Mr. Yang, he added later, \u201cconnects with people who feel like they don\u2019t matter or count.\u201d Now, Mr. Ramey said, he talks with Mr. Yang almost every week. He has become involved with the group \u201cTruckers for Yang,\u201d which recently put its first 53-foot custom-wrapped tractor-trailer on the road. Mr. Ramey watched Tuesday\u2019s debate, and he said he knew Mr. Yang would find a way to mention truckers. But he appears unfazed by being thrust in the spotlight. \u201cThere\u2019s no real fame,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve always just wanted to get Andrew in office, and it\u2019s going to happen.\u201d This made my day.

      "content": " Hillary Clinton said Wednesday she hoped for a return to \u201cboring, normal times\u201d after the 2020 election, voicing skepticism of her party\u2019s populist wing and predicting that Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s proposal for single-payer health care would never get enacted. At The New York Times DealBook conference in New York, Mrs. Clinton said she saw two of the biggest policies embraced by the left in the 2020 Democratic primary \u2014 \u201cMedicare for all\u201d-style health care and a tax on the assets of the very wealthy \u2014 as unworkable or politically impractical. She said Democrats should pursue the goal of universal health coverage, but through other means. A longtime leader of her party\u2019s moderate wing, Mrs. Clinton was most blunt about Ms. Warren\u2019s proposal to replace private health insurance with a single-payer system funded largely by taxes on the wealthy and corporations. Asked if she thought that proposal could get passed into law, Mrs. Clinton answered in the negative. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the goal is the right goal.\u201d Mrs. Clinton did not criticize either Ms. Warren or Senator Bernie Sanders, the liberal populist who challenged Mrs. Clinton in the 2016 primary and who also supports Medicare for all, in harsh or personal terms. But she suggested that the approach to health care favored by both was misguided, saying that \u201cthe smarter approach is to build on what we have\u201d by adding the option of a public health care plan to the offerings of the Affordable Care Act. It is not a surprising preference for Mrs. Clinton: In the 2016 campaign, she supported introducing a public health insurance option but consistently rejected Mr. Sanders\u2019s calls for single-payer health care. Speaking on Thursday at North Carolina A&T State University in Greensboro, N.C., Ms. Warren was asked about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s remarks. \u201cI\u2019m saying, you don\u2019t get what you don\u2019t fight for,\u201d she said in response. \u201cYou know, you got to be willing to get out there and fight.\u201d Mrs. Clinton\u2019s comments suggest she remains skeptical of the populist forces on the rise in Democratic politics. While she did not endorse a candidate, she indicated a clear preference in one of the largest debates raging in the Democratic Party: whether to nominate a candidate who would make sweeping changes to the country\u2019s government and economy, or someone who would restore something like normalcy in Washington. \u201cI would like us to return to a presidency where we don\u2019t have to wake up every day worried,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said, adding, \u201cI\u2019d like us to get back to sort of boring, normal times.\u201d She also said she believed she knew who the Democratic nominee was \u201clikely to be,\u201d but declined to name that person. Mrs. Clinton, who has not entirely ruled out another run for the presidency but has taken no apparent steps toward a campaign, also sounded a note of skepticism about the detail-rich policy debates that have helped shape the Democratic primary so far. Those disputes during primary season, she said, do not always translate into actual governance after the election. Her 2008 primary battle with Barack Obama furnished an instructive case study, Mrs. Clinton said: During that campaign, Mr. Obama fiercely opposed her proposal for a government mandate that all individuals purchase health insurance, but he went on to include that very rule as president. The clash over health care unfolding in the primary now, she said, represented \u201ca very healthy debate.\u201d Of a tax on wealth, which is favored by both Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders, Mrs. Clinton questioned whether it could really function as its proponents intend. She said she would support other methods of taxing the rich, like raising income-tax rates, imposing stiffer estate taxes and eliminating certain provisions of the tax code that favor the financial sector. \u201cI think there are other ways to raise the revenues, and ways that do get those who are well-off to pay more, because I do think we\u2019ve got to have that as part of our effort to combat inequality,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. In theory, Mrs. Clinton herself could be subject to the wealth taxes proposed by Ms. Warren, who has called for a levy on fortunes over $50 million, and Mr. Sanders, who would impose a similar tax on fortunes greater than $32 million. Mrs. Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, have earned well over $100 million through paid speaking and book deals since the turn of the century.",
