      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 Republican leaders, turning away from significant gun control legislation, have shifted instead toward measures that would beef up security at the nation\u2019s schools, hoping the push will quell public uproar over the recent massacre in Parkland, Fla. But as students and parents from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School continue their own organizing, the school safety strategy is unlikely to end the debate. Democrats and gun control advocates accused Republicans and the National Rifle Association of using school safety to divert attention from what they see as the real issue: the proliferation of guns that have been used in mass shootings at concerts, in movie theaters, on college campuses, in churches and at workplaces, as well as at public schools. \u201cThis time, the gun rights crowd messed with the wrong community, the wrong kids and the wrong dad,\u201d said Fred Guttenberg, whose 14-year-old daughter, Jaime, was killed at the school. He added, \u201cI intend to be a part of breaking this gun lobby.\u201d The Republican-controlled House plans to vote next week on the STOP School Violence Act, a bill that would authorize $50 million annually for safety improvements, including training teachers and students in how to prevent violence and developing anonymous reporting systems for threats of school violence. The bill, drafted by Representative John Rutherford, a Republican and former sheriff from Jacksonville, Fla., is one of a flurry of bipartisan measures introduced in the House and the Senate devoted to school safety \u2014 without curbs on guns. In the Senate, a companion bill would also give schools money for physical improvements, such as installing metal detectors or bulletproof doors. And Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, the chairman of the Senate education committee, introduced his own school safety measure on Wednesday. His bill would allow 100,000 public schools to use federal dollars for school counselors, alarm systems, security cameras and crisis intervention training. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos threw her weight behind what she said was the only approach that could muster broad support after a brief but contentious visit on Wednesday to Stoneman Douglas High School, where 17 students and faculty were gunned down on Valentine\u2019s Day. \u201cI think there\u2019s an opportunity to take some practical steps that many, many people agree on and continue pushing forward on things that have broad support,\u201d she said. But as the midterm election season begins, the school safety votes may only be an opening volley. \u201cThe Republicans would like to have the public think they\u2019re doing something and have the N.R.A. think they\u2019re doing nothing,\u201d said Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the No. 2 Democrat in the House. Gun control has long been one of the most divisive and contentious issues in Washington, and the rush to legislate on school safety reflects the difficulty of passing measures that have anything to do with guns. On Wednesday, students advocating gun safety legislation staged a sit-in outside the office of Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, chanting \u201cEnough is enough!\u201d and \u201cNot one more!\u201d Eight were arrested, police said. But most gun safety proposals \u2014 including expanding background checks for gun purchases, raising the minimum age for buying rifles to 21 from 18, banning assault-style weapons like the AR-15 used by the gunman in Parkland and taking guns away from people deemed mentally unfit \u2014 appear to be going nowhere on Capitol Hill. President Trump\u2019s mercurial statements have not helped. At a televised White House session, he appeared to back broad gun control legislation, only to muddy his position after an evening meeting with the N.R.A.\u2019s chief lobbyist. One exception is the Fix NICS Act, a modest measure that would offer incentives to states and federal agencies to improve reporting to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS, for gun purchasers. The measure, which is backed by the N.R.A., has already passed the House and has broad bipartisan support in the Senate. But even that legislation is facing a hurdle: Mr. McConnell cannot bring it up quickly for a vote because Senate rules require unanimous consent to do so, and at least one senator, Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, has objected. And while Mr. McConnell is a co-sponsor of the Senate\u2019s version of the STOP School Violence Act, he has not said when the Senate will consider it. The Senate\u2019s chief sponsor of the STOP School Violence Act, Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, said in an interview Wednesday that his aim was to focus on \u201cspecial programs and special approaches toward making these schools safer and more acceptable to the families and kids.\u201d As for Democrats who consider the measure insufficient, Mr. Hatch said: \u201cThat\u2019s their motif every time. I mean, they know that if they can raise hell against guns and so forth, that that gives them a lot of publicity. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily help us in our educational processes.\u201d Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut and a co-sponsor of Mr. Hatch\u2019s bill, said he did not want the Senate to lose sight of more far-reaching legislation that would address gun violence head-on. \u201cThat\u2019s a useful bill, but it doesn\u2019t have anything to do with gun laws,\u201d Mr. Murphy said. \u201cAnybody whose only solution to the school shooting epidemic is to make our schools fortresses doesn\u2019t understand the root of this problem.\u201d Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, also welcomed efforts to increase safety measures and resources, but she said legislators and Mr. Trump had used it deflect from the larger demands of the public, including students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas, who had been in the forefront of gun control advocacy since the shooting. \u201cThe kids from Stoneman Douglas said, \u2018Do certain common-sense, gun violence reduction measures \u2014 don\u2019t change the subject,\u2019\u201d Ms. Weingarten said. While Republicans were talking about school safety, Senate Democrats on Thursday sought to keep the focus on guns. Senators Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, and Bill Nelson of Florida, convened a Democrats-only afternoon hearing to take testimony from those affected by gun violence. Among the witnesses were Mr. Guttenberg and David Hogg, a 17-year-old Stoneman Douglas senior who has become a vocal national spokesman for gun control. In Parkland on Wednesday, Ms. DeVos was greeted less than enthusiastically by many students, who took to social media to complain that she did not have any substantive interactions with them. (Dwyane Wade, a basketball star for the Miami Heat who visited after Ms. DeVos, got a much warmer reception.) \u201cI thought she would at least give us her \u2018thoughts and prayers,\u2019 but she refused to even meet/speak with students. I don\u2019t understand the point of her being here,\u201d tweeted Carly Novell, editor of the student newspaper, The Eagle Eye, which covered the secretary\u2019s visit. Another student, Aly Sheehy, tweeted, \u201cDo something unexpected: answer our questions.\u201d The Education Department said that Ms. DeVos visited some students and teachers and laid a wreath, and that her visit was developed with the principal\u2019s recommendations in mind to \u201cprovide minimal disruption on students\u2019 first full day back in the school.\u201d In her news conference, Ms. DeVos said she promised student journalists that she would return to meet with them.",

GreenPRINT EDITIONTrump Points to Culprit in School Shootings, and It Isn\u2019t Guns|March 14, 2018, Page A10",
      "author": "Erica L. Green",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 After a gunman marauded through Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School last month, conservative commentators \u2014 looking for a culprit \u2014 seized on an unlikely target: an Obama-era guidance document that sought to rein in the suspensions and expulsions of minority students. Black students have never been the perpetrators of the mass shootings that have shocked the nation\u2019s conscience nor have minority schools been the targets. But the argument went that any relaxation of disciplinary efforts could let a killer slip through the cracks. And this week, President Trump made the connection, announcing that Education Secretary Betsy DeVos will lead a school safety commission charged in part with examining the \u201crepeal of the Obama administration\u2019s \u2018Rethink School Discipline\u2019 policies.\u201d To civil rights groups, connecting an action to help minority students with mass killings in suburban schools smacked of burdening black children with a largely white scourge. \u201cYet again, the Trump administration, faced with a domestic crisis, has responded by creating a commission to study an unrelated issue in order to ultimately advance a discriminatory and partisan goal,\u201d said Sherrilyn Ifill, the president and director-counsel at NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc. \u201cSchool shootings are a grave and preventable problem, but rescinding the school discipline guidance is not the answer,\u201d she said. \u201cRepealing the guidance will not stop the next school shooter, but it will ensure that thousands more students of color are unnecessarily ushered into the school-to-prison pipeline.\u201d The issue of the Obama-era discipline guidance was raised formally by Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, who, after seeing a flurry of conservative news media reports, wrote a letter to Ms. DeVos and Attorney General Jeff Sessions questioning whether the guidance allowed the shooting suspect, Nikolas Cruz, to evade law enforcement and carry out the massacre at Stoneman Douglas High. It was, on its face, an odd point: Mr. Cruz is white, and far from evading school disciplinary procedures, he had been expelled from Stoneman Douglas. \u201cThe overarching goals of the 2014 directive to mitigate the school-to-prison pipeline, reduce suspensions and expulsions, and to prevent racially biased discipline are laudable and should be explored,\u201d Mr. Rubio wrote, asking that the guidance be revised. \u201cHowever, any policy seeking to achieve these goals requires basic common sense and an understanding that failure to report troubled students, like Cruz, to law enforcement can have dangerous repercussions.\u201d Broward County educators and advocates saw Mr. Rubio\u2019s letter as an indictment of a program called Promise, which the county instituted in 2013 \u2014 one year before the Obama guidance was issued \u2014 and has guided its discipline reforms to reduce student-based arrests in Broward County, where Stoneman Douglas is. The N.A.A.C.P. said that Mr. Rubio \u201cnotably backs away from raising the purchase age for assault-style rifles and restricting magazine capacity,\u201d and instead focuses on a system that once sent one million minority students to Florida jails for \u201csimple and routine discipline issues ranging from talking back to teachers to schoolyard scuffles.\u201d The program was praised by former Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, and echoes the goals of the 2014 Obama guidance in discouraging schools from using law enforcement as a first line of defense for low-level offenses. In the days before making his request, Mr. Rubio released a proposal that he said would remedy lapses in the  Promise program and the 2014 guidance. In a tweet on Tuesday, Mr. Rubio noted that the gunman was not in the Promise program, but had displayed violent and threatening behavior. \u201cThe more we learn, the more it appears the problem is not the program or the DOE guidance itself, but the way it is being applied,\u201d Mr. Rubio said, referring to the Education Department. \u201cIt may have created a culture discourages referral to law enforcement even in egregious cases like the #Parkland shooter.\u201d Long before the attack in Parkland, Fla., the 2014 discipline guidelines, which encouraged schools to examine their discipline disparities and to take stock of discriminatory policies, were already on Ms. DeVos\u2019s radar \u2014 but not because they were seen as a possible culprit in the next school shooting. Conservatives were using the Trump administration\u2019s effort to rein in federal overreach to reverse policies designed to protect against what the Obama administration had seen as discriminatory practices. The \u201cRethink Discipline,\u201d package that Mr. Trump\u2019s commission will examine includes guidance that the Obama administration issued on the legal limitations on the use of restraints and seclusion, corporal punishment and equity for special education students. In recent months, educators and policy experts from across the country have traveled to Washington to voice support for and opposition to the disciplinary guidance, in private meetings with officials at the Education Department and in a series of public forums. At a briefing hosted by the United States Commission on Civil Rights, dozens of policy experts, researchers, educators and parents sounded off on the Obama-era discipline policy in a meeting that became so racially charged that some black attendees walked out. Since the discipline guidelines were issued, conservatives have blamed the document for creating unsafe educational environments by pressuring schools to keep suspension numbers down to meet racial quotas, even if it meant ignoring troubling and criminal behavior. Teachers who sought suspensions or expulsions of minority students were painted as racists, conservatives maintained. \u201cEvidence is mounting that efforts to fight the school-to-prison pipeline is creating a school climate catastrophe and has if anything put at-risk students at greater risk,\u201d said Max Eden, a senior fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute, who argued that teacher bias was not the driving force behind school discipline. But proponents argued that racial bias was well documented. When the guidance was issued, federal data found that African-American students without disabilities were more than three times as likely as their white peers without disabilities to be expelled or suspended, and that more than 50 percent of students who were involved in school-related arrests or who were referred to law enforcement were Hispanic or African-American. \u201cChildren\u2019s safety also includes protection from oppression and bigotry and injustice,\u201d Daniel J. Losen, director of the Center for Civil Rights Remedies at the University of California at Los Angeles\u2019s Civil Rights Project, wrote in testimony to the Civil Rights Commission. \u201cFear-mongering and rhetoric that criminalizes youth of color, children from poor families and children with disabilities should not be tolerated.\u201d The Education and Justice Departments wrote in a 2014 Dear Colleague letter that discipline disparities could be caused by a range of factors, but the statistics in the federal data \u201care not explained by more frequent or more serious misbehavior by students of color.\u201d The departments also noted that several civil rights investigations had verified that minority students were disciplined more harshly than their white peers for the same infractions. \u201cIn short, racial discrimination in school discipline is a real problem,\u201d the guidance said. In recent months, Ms. DeVos has said change will be coming. She has already moved to rescind a regulation that protects against racial disparities in special education placements. Her goal, she said last month, was to be \u201csensitive to all of the parties involved.\u201d In a bruising interview on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d on Sunday, Ms. DeVos said that the disproportionate discipline issue \u201ccomes down to individual kids.\u201d She declined to say whether she believed that black students disciplined more harshly for the same infraction were the victims of institutional racism. \u201cWe\u2019re studying it carefully and are committed to making sure students have opportunity to learn in safe and nurturing environments,\u201d she said. Ms. DeVos\u2019s office for civil rights also announced that it would scale back the scope of investigations, reversing an approach taken under the Obama administration to conduct exhaustive reviews of school districts\u2019 practices and data when a discrimination complaint was filed. But Ms. DeVos\u2019s own administration has continued to find racial disparities. In November, the Education Department found that the Loleta Union Elementary School District in California doled out harsher treatment to Native American students than their white peers. For example, a Native American student received a one-day out-of-school suspension for slapping another student on the way to the bus, in what was that student\u2019s first disciplinary referral of the year. A white student received lunch detention for slapping two students on the same day \u2014 the student\u2019s fifth and sixth referrals that year. While Mr. Cruz was repeatedly kicked out of class and ultimately expelled, it is unclear whether he was ever referred to the police for his behavior in school. However, Mr. Cruz was known to law enforcement, which never found cause to arrest him, and a report of troublesome behavior to the F.B.I. went unheeded. The Broward County superintendent, Robert Runcie, said that Mr. Rubio\u2019s effort to connect the district\u2019s discipline policies to the Stoneman Douglas shooting was misguided. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to dismantle a program that\u2019s been successful in the district because of false information that someone has put out there,\u201d Mr. Runcie said on Twitter. \u201cWe will neither manage nor lead by rumors.\u201d",

Here\u2019s Why.Even with Republicans in charge, the measure increases funding for many programs the president had sought to cut or kill, and in some cases bars him from pursuing his goals.By Julie Hirschfeld DavisPRINT EDITIONA Republican Budget, but Not Exactly What the President Asked For|March 23, 2018, Page A20",
      "author": "Julie Hirschfeld Davis",
      "content": " The $1.3 trillion spending plan passed early Friday by Congress delivered a broad rebuke to President Trump\u2019s vision for shaking up government, ignoring many of his ideas for cutting domestic programs and, in some cases, expressly barring him from accomplishing his goals. Last year, in his first budget request for fiscal 2018, Mr. Trump envisioned a drastic reordering of government priorities, in which a large increase in military spending would be matched by deep cuts to foreign aid, the diplomatic corps, education, environmental cleanup and other domestic programs \u2014 many of which he would eliminate. The bill now heads to the president\u2019s desk. Here\u2019s a breakdown of what\u2019s in it and what it means. The package that will arrive on Mr. Trump\u2019s desk this week for what he has conceded will be a grudging signature contains a sizable increase for the military but few of the reductions he had sought. It reflects the triumph of politically palatable bipartisan deals for lawmakers who are preparing to face voters in midterm elections over the audacious promises of a president who has styled himself as a change agent, but has been unable to persuade a Congress controlled by his own party. The \u201cbig, beautiful wall\u201d? Not this year. Deep cuts to environmental programs, clean energy initiatives and biomedical research? Congress said no, thanks. Zeroing out federal arts programs? Lawmakers gave them a modest increase. \u201cHad to waste money on Dem giveaways in order to take care of military pay increase and new equipment,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Twitter this week, venting his frustration about the bill, which he briefly threatened to torpedo on Wednesday in the final hours before it was unveiled. The administration sought to put the best face on the measure on Thursday, highlighting the large military funding increase and spending on the president\u2019s priorities \u2014 immigration enforcement, school safety, infrastructure and combating opioid abuse \u2014 even as his top advisers conceded it fell short of what they had sought. \u201cIn order to get the defense spending, primarily, but all the rest of our priorities funded, we had to give away a lot of stuff that we didn\u2019t want to give away,\u201d Mick Mulvaney, Mr. Trump\u2019s budget director. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the top Senate Democrat, argued that the president was simply outnegotiated. \u201cHe either won\u2019t take yes for an answer, or he\u2019s not allowed to take yes for an answer,\u201d Mr. Schumer said in an interview. \u201cThe fact that they really were not negotiating in a realistic way gave us much more room to accomplish what we wanted to.\u201d Nowhere was the dynamic on more vivid display than on Mr. Trump\u2019s cherished proposal to spend tens of billions of dollars on a wall on the nation\u2019s border with Mexico. The bill includes nearly $1.6 billion for border security \u2014 including new technology and repairs to existing barriers \u2014 but not Mr. Trump\u2019s wall, as he claimed on Twitter on Wednesday. That includes $641 million for about 33 miles of fencing that was previously authorized under the 2006 Secure Fence Act, passed during the George W. Bush administration. But the measure prohibits building a concrete wall or other prototypes the president has considered, and allocates the rest of the funding for new aircraft, sensors and surveillance technology. The measure also explicitly rejects Mr. Trump\u2019s plan for a hiring spree of border officers, an idea critics have condemned as an attempt to unleash a \u201cdeportation force.\u201d The president signed an executive order during his first week in office last year calling for 10,000 additional Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, and he sought 2,000 in his budget request. The bill caps the number at 65. The measure bars funding for some school choice measures, including private school vouchers, a signature issue for Betsy DeVos, Mr. Trump\u2019s education secretary. And the bill rejected Ms. DeVos\u2019s efforts to shrink her department\u2019s spending; it increased the education budget by $3.9 billion. \u201cAfter more than a year on the job, I would have hoped Secretary DeVos would have learned by now that her extreme ideas to privatize our nation\u2019s public schools and dismantle the Department of Education do not have support among parents or in Congress, but unfortunately that does not seem to be the case,\u201d said Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the top Democrat on the education committee. \u201cI\u2019m proud to have worked with Republicans in Congress to flatly reject these ideas.\u201d Congress increased the budget of two K-12 programs that Ms. DeVos had sought to eliminate \u2014 one that pays for after-school programs for 1.8 million low-income students and another that helps schools fund mental health services and violence-prevention initiatives. The spending plan also reversed cuts to programs that helped low-income college students, such as the federal work-study program that Ms. DeVos had sought to halve. Public charter schools, which Ms. DeVos has championed and are generally supported across party lines, received a funding boost. The Environmental Protection Agency was one of the few parts of the government that did not receive a substantial spending bump in the package, but the measure kept funding for the agency essentially flat at $8.1 billion, rejecting the 30 percent cut sought by Mr. Trump and Scott Pruitt, the administrator. Activists saw that as a victory. \u201cWe regard this bill as being a solid repudiation of the Trump-Pruitt efforts to eviscerate the agency\u2019s budget,\u201d said Elgie Holstein, senior director for strategic planning at the Environmental Defense Fund. At the same time, he said the agency was operating at funding levels lower than in President Ronald Reagan\u2019s final year in office, calling its funding level a \u201clong-term starvation diet.\u201d The agency has lost hundreds of employees to buyouts and retirements over the past year. In addition to keeping overall funding at 2017 levels, Congress blocked a giant reduction in staffing by wiping out a proposed $60 million for \u201cwork-force reshaping.\u201d That money would have gone toward more buyouts and a reorganization that could have included shrinking or shuttering regional E.P.A. offices. And while Mr. Trump sought deep cuts to Energy Department programs focused on developing the next generation of clean energy technologies, such as advanced batteries or carbon capture for power plants, the measure substantially increased them. Mr. Trump had proposed cutting the department\u2019s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy by 69 percent; Congress instead increased funding 14 percent. He had sought to eliminate the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, which funds research into long-shot energy technologies like algae biofuels; the measure increases its budget 16 percent. Programs for basic science, nuclear power, advanced manufacturing and fossil fuels also received double-digit percentage increases. Lawmakers also saved pet regional programs that Mr. Trump had targeted for elimination. Those include $300 million for cleaning up toxic sediment from the Great Lakes and $73 million to restore the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland. The inspector general\u2019s office, which is investigating Mr. Pruitt\u2019s extensive first-class travel, also avoided the budget ax and maintained the previous year\u2019s level of $41.5 million. In his budget blueprint for 2018, Mr. Trump proposed defunding the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities. Instead, Congress provided $153 million for each agency, an increase of $3 million in each case over 2017. Lawmakers also rebuffed Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal to eliminate funds for the popular Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, providing $3.6 billion, an increase of $250 million over 2017. Congress ignored Mr. Trump\u2019s plan to reduce the State Department\u2019s budget by about 30 percent \u2014 with huge cuts to basic diplomacy, support for the United Nations and a vast medicine-buying program begun by Mr. Bush that allows millions of Africans with H.I.V. to survive. Instead, the bill provides $54 billion for the department, a modest cut from 2017, keeping H.I.V. funding level. Congress also rejected Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal for a $7.5 billion cut to the National Institutes of Health, the medical research agency, providing a total of $37 billion, an increase of $3 billion from 2017. The Department of Housing and Urban Development received a $4.7 billion overall funding boost, instead of the $6 billion reduction the president sought. The agency\u2019s $52.7 billion budget included significant increases to programs Mr. Trump had proposed cutting or killing, including community development block grants, the HOME program for affordable housing and a 42 percent increase in money to repair the nation\u2019s crumbling public housing infrastructure, a program the president planned to virtually eliminate. The most important addition was an increase of $1.25 billion for the department\u2019s core rental assistance programs.",

GreenPRINT EDITIONU.S. to Review Tribes\u2019 Claim Of Racism In Classroom|January 5, 2019, Page A9",
      "author": "Annie Waldman",
      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 This article is a collaboration between ProPublica and The New York Times. A year and a half after receiving a detailed complaint from tribal leaders, the Education Department plans to investigate their accusations that the Wolf Point School District in Montana discriminates against Native American students. In a Dec. 28 letter, sent hours after The New York Times and ProPublica published an investigation into racial inequities in the district, the department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights notified the lawyer representing the tribal executive board of the Fort Peck Indian Reservation in eastern Montana that it would look into the complaint. The board includes members of the Assiniboine and Sioux tribes. Native American and mixed-race students make up more than three-quarters of Wolf Point\u2019s enrollment. According to the letter, the investigation will focus on whether Wolf Point schools discipline Native students more harshly than white students, shunt them into remedial programs without appropriate cause, and deny them special education evaluations and services. The department said it would also examine whether the district failed to respond to a parent\u2019s accusations that a Native student was racially harassed. The student was not identified in the tribal complaint or in the letter. \u201cTribal children have suffered unfairly for years in the Wolf Point School District,\u201d said Melina Healey, the lawyer representing the tribal executive board. She called for a \u201cswift and thorough investigation that leads to much-needed reforms.\u201d The Office for Civil Rights is already looking into a complaint by Louella Contreras that the Wolf Point district failed to provide her granddaughter Ruth Fourstar with special education services. The department\u2019s decision to look into the tribal leaders\u2019 broader accusations bucks the Education Department\u2019s policy under Secretary Betsy DeVos of pulling back from investigating complaints of systemic discrimination by schools and colleges, and concentrating on mistreatment of individuals. ProPublica reported in June that under Ms. DeVos, the department had scuttled more than 1,200 civil rights investigations that began under the Obama administration and lasted at least six months. Nationwide, more than 90 percent of Native students attend integrated public schools, near or on reservations, that have historically restricted tribal influence over curriculum, funding and staffing. Native American students have some of the worst academic outcomes in public schools: They score lower than nearly all other demographic groups on national tests, and less than three-fourths of Native students graduate from high school. In June 2017, the tribal executive board filed a 46-page complaint that described dozens of instances where Wolf Point schools provided limited academic opportunities and social support to Native students. ProPublica and The Times found that Native students in Wolf Point are twice as likely to receive at least one suspension compared with their white peers, and white students are more than 10 times as likely to take at least one advanced placement course as Native students, according to an analysis of federal education data. In interviews, students, staff and parents said Wolf Point\u2019s schools push Native children into a poorly funded, understaffed program for remedial and truant students. Native students said they were dropped from sports teams after giving birth, while a white student was not. The Times-ProPublica investigation also found that some Native students have turned to self-harm and suicide. Three months before the tribal executive board\u2019s complaint, a Wolf Point High School junior killed himself after a public rebuke from the principal for poor attendance, two students said. He was the second student at the high school in seven years to take his own life after being chided by district administrators. Jeana Lervick, a lawyer representing the school district, said on Wednesday that the district is closed for the holidays and is unable to comment on the federal investigation. \u201cWolf Point Schools works constantly to address the challenges facing our students and, in particular, our Indigenous students,\u201d Ms. Lervick said in an earlier statement. \u201cOur district is aware of historical issues in our nation and as educators do everything in our power to address them.\u201d The district\u2019s superintendent and the high school principal did not respond to emailed questions. Should civil rights investigators identify violations of federal law, the school district could lose federal funding. Typically, before investigators recommend sanctions, school districts voluntarily enter into an agreement with the Education Department to remedy any wrongdoing. Federal civil rights investigations can take up to several years to resolve. \u201cInstead of providing a safe learning environment, the Wolf Point School District adds to the long history of educational abuses of our tribal communities,\u201d said Roxanne Gourneau, a former member of the Fort Peck tribal executive board, who has worked to overhaul Wolf Point schools since her son killed himself after being disciplined at the high school. \u201cThe school district has done more to fuel Native students\u2019 trauma than to support their education. Change is long overdue.\u201d",

      "content": " WEST BLOOMFIELD TOWNSHIP, Mich. \u2014 The first lady, Melania Trump, in another public indication that she may refocus on efforts related to an early promise to combat cyberbullying, visited a middle school here in this Detroit suburb on Monday, and, in between posing for selfies, urged students to treat one another with respect and kindness. \u201cI encourage you to find a new friend and eat lunch with a new friend,\u201d Mrs. Trump told a group of seventh- and eighth-grade students who had gathered in the cafeteria with their lunchboxes, backpacks and smartphones. \u201cI think it\u2019s very important to choose kindness and compassion.\u201d Mrs. Trump has ramped up her public appearances in recent weeks, and she has shown that she is willing to travel without her husband, who spent his Monday morning railing against football players kneeling for the national anthem and facing criticism from the widow of a soldier killed in Niger. The lunchtime visit to Orchard Lake Middle School was meant to lend some attention to \u201cNo One Eats Alone,\u201d an initiative intended to teach children inclusion skills, and to acknowledge the \u201cWeek of Inclusion,\u201d part of National Bullying Prevention Month, though officials with the groups that started the programs said they did not hear about the trip from the White House. Mrs. Trump\u2019s plans are unclear as her East Wing staff remains small \u2014 nine people work for the first lady, roughly less than half of the number of people who worked for her predecessors. She has also not hired a director of policy, who could help advance her agenda. Still, the middle schoolers appeared to be more interested in taking selfies than listening to policy details: Lunchtime chatter ceased and shrieking began after Mrs. Trump entered the room with Betsy DeVos, the education secretary. \u201cRemember,\u201d a school administrator reminded the excited students, \u201cwe\u2019re not shoving phones in people\u2019s faces.\u201d As she strolled around the lunchroom, Mrs. Trump, a Slovenian-born former model, seemed aware of the power of a photograph. She posed for dozens of selfies, shook hands and invited a few particularly shy-looking students to step closer. Mrs. Trump and Ms. DeVos visited a sixth-grade classroom where students focused on a lesson geared toward emotional learning. There, the first lady helped students sort words into groups \u2014 \u201cisolated\u201d went in one word pile, \u201ctogether\u201d in another \u2014 and huddled with the students to ask about their hobbies and offer them advice. \u201cDon\u2019t try to copy somebody,\u201d Mrs. Trump said to a group of students in a somewhat stilted side conversation. Smiling, she added, \u201cNo drugs. No cigarettes.\u201d According to her aides, the first lady is aware of criticism directed at her bullying prevention efforts, given the president\u2019s proclivity for digital insults. Stephanie Grisham, the first lady\u2019s communications director, said that Mrs. Trump is an \u201cindependent woman\u201d who would continue her efforts. \u201cShe\u2019s used to naysayers,\u201d Ms. Grisham said. \u201cAnd this is not going to be new for her. She\u2019s made a commitment to children in many different areas, and this is one of them.\u201d Officials at Pacer\u2019s National Bullying Prevention Center, the organization behind National Bullying Prevention Month, said that they were not aware that the first lady was visiting Michigan but have made efforts to reach out to the White House. Paula F. Goldberg, Pacer\u2019s executive director and co-founder, said in an interview that she hoped Mrs. Trump would \u201ccontinue speaking out about cyberbullying and bullying prevention.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a role she could play, and one that is very important,\u201d Ms. Goldberg added. Laura Talmus, who helped found Beyond Differences, the Bay Area nonprofit that created \u201cNo One Eats Alone\u201d in 2012, said she had also not heard from the White House. \u201cThey really have to extend far beyond a one-time appearance at a school,\u201d Ms. Talmus said in an interview. \u201cWe just hope that constant care of children all year round, including what they read and hear on social media, and the news and at home at the dinner table will also be something that can be influenced.\u201d In a statement, Mrs. Trump said the same. \u201cBy our own example, we must teach children to be good stewards of the world they will inherit,\u201d Mrs. Trump said. \u201cWe need to remember that they are always watching and listening.\u201d As she prepares to formally start a platform in the coming months, Mrs. Trump\u2019s recent trips are more like short jaunts that allow her to lend her image to causes without speaking at length in public or traveling too far from the White House. She prefers to arrive home before her 11-year-old son, Barron, returns from school, Ms. Grisham said. Next week, though, Mrs. Trump will accompany Mr. Trump on a trip to Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam, the Philippines and Hawaii.",

      "author": "Anemona Hartocollis",
      "content": "  Four women met late last month at a restaurant in a Twin Cities suburb, where they spoke for hours, so intently their waiter had trouble getting their drink orders. Each had a son who had been accused at college of sexual assault. One was expelled and another suspended. The other two were cleared, yet one had contemplated suicide and the other was so crushed he had not returned to school. The women had been meeting regularly to share notes and commiserate. Now, over red wine in a corner booth, they were finally savoring a victory. A few days before, Betsy DeVos, the education secretary, had rescinded tough Obama-era guidelines on campus sexual assault, saying they violated principles of fairness, particularly for accused students like their own sons. \u201cWhat she is doing with this issue is spot on,\u201d one of the women, Sherry Warner Seefeld, said. Few issues in education today are as intensely debated as the way colleges deal with sexual misconduct. Women\u2019s groups and victims\u2019 advocates have deplored Ms. DeVos\u2019s moves, saying they will allow colleges to wash their hands of the problem. But a growing corps of legal experts and defense lawyers have argued that the Obama rules created a culture in which accused students, most of them men, were presumed guilty. And some of the most potent advocates for those men have been a group of women: their own mothers. Some of the mothers met with Ms. DeVos in July to tell their stories, and Ms. DeVos alluded to them in a speech she gave last month. An advocacy group founded in 2013 by several mothers, Families Advocating for Campus Equality, or FACE, has grown to hundreds of families, who have exchanged tens of thousands of messages through their email list, said Cynthia Garrett, co-president of the group. The mothers lobby Congress, testify on proposed legislation and policy, and track lawsuits filed by men who say they have been wrongly accused. A bill in the California Legislature that they testified against, which would have enshrined the Obama-era regulations into state law, passed both houses but was vetoed this month by Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, who said it was \u201ctime to pause\u201d on the issue. The group holds twice-yearly meetings, where parents and sons share personal experiences and listen to advice from psychologists and lawyers. Away from the public eye, families have spent tens of thousands of dollars and dipped into retirement savings to hire lawyers and therapists for their sons. Some have pressured colleges to reconsider punishment or expunge disciplinary notations from transcripts, so that other colleges and employers cannot see them. Ms. Seefeld said she hired a lawyer and even a public relations firm, and used her political connections as a teachers\u2019 union leader, to try to get the University of North Dakota to reverse her son\u2019s three-year banishment after a woman accused him of nonconsensual sex. \u201cI was willing to do everything and anything,\u201d Ms. Seefeld said. Her son Caleb Warner was ultimately cleared after the college took a second look at the case. The mothers\u2019 resolve comes from their raw maternal instinct to protect their children. But several who agreed to interviews also said they did not doubt that their sons\u2019 accusers had felt hurt. Their sons may not have been falsely accused, the mothers said, but they had been wrongly accused. They made a distinction. One mother, Judith, said her son had been expelled after having sex with a student who said she had been too intoxicated to give consent. \u201cIn my generation, what these girls are going through was never considered assault,\u201d Judith said. \u201cIt was considered, \u2018I was stupid and I got embarrassed.\u2019\u201d Ms. DeVos issued temporary guidance for colleges last month and will invite public comment while developing permanent regulations. Most significantly so far, she has lifted the requirement that colleges use the lowest standard of proof, \u201cpreponderance of the evidence,\u201d in deciding whether to uphold a charge of sexual misconduct. Colleges are now free to demand more convincing evidence, a move that the mothers and other advocates for the accused had called for, saying that students should not be punished in cases where there is some doubt about the accusation. The most active mothers said they stepped forward because they often had more time than their husbands, and because they made a strategic decision that they could be effective on the issue of sexual assault precisely because they are women and, as some described themselves, feminists. \u201cWe recognized that power,\u201d Ms. Seefeld said. Many women, however, feel exactly the opposite way. A number of women\u2019s groups and victims\u2019 advocates have argued that a tougher standard of proof will discourage women from coming forward. They have not been shy about expressing their view of the mothers as \u201crape deniers\u201d and misogynists who blame women for inviting male violence against them. Jessica Davidson, a victim of campus sexual assault and the managing director of End Rape on Campus, said it appeared that the mothers had a strong emotional impact on Ms. DeVos, who separately met with victims, including Ms. Davidson. \u201cIt is of course an immensely difficult thing to believe somebody you love could rape or harm another person,\u201d Ms. Davidson said. But, she said of the mothers, \u201cI think it\u2019s the wrong thing for them to do to try and push back an entire movement.\u201d Of a dozen mothers who were interviewed, almost all asked to be identified by their first names only. They said they wanted to protect their sons from being publicly revealed as having been disciplined, or even accused, in a sexual assault case. The mothers obsessively type their sons\u2019 names into Google, and are relieved when their cases do not come up. Some of the mothers remember the moment they learned their sons had been accused as vividly as other people remember hearing that planes had struck the World Trade Center. Alison was pushing her cart down the aisle at a supermarket, looking at Tide detergent, when she got the call from her younger son. He had left home for college for the first time about seven weeks before. \u201cI think I have a problem,\u201d her son said. \u201cIt\u2019s bad.\u201d She felt a flash of irritation. \u201cHow many times have I told you, you need to keep it zippered,\u201d she said she told him. Then the gravity of the situation sank in. \u201cI need to hire a lawyer,\u201d she thought. A female student had told the university police that she had been sexually assaulted at an apartment near campus. As Alison tells it, the woman had propositioned her son and consented to sex. She learned more about her 19-year-old son\u2019s intimate behavior than any mother would want to know, and found herself talking about it \u201cas if it were the grocery list,\u201d she recalled. Officials at the university declined to comment on the case, citing student confidentiality rules. According to university documents provided by Alison, her son was cleared. Additionally, a grand jury declined to indict him, she said. But, Alison contends, the investigation should never even have gotten that far, and the damage was already done. Her son had become a pariah, dropped by his friends and called a rapist by women on campus. The semester after he was cleared he called home, sobbing, to say he could no longer take it and was dropping out, she said. Five years later, at 24, he has not received a diploma and is trying to ease back into college life by taking courses online. Alison and her son were among the delegation that met with Ms. DeVos in July. \u201cIt was very solemn,\u201d Alison said. \u201cIt was as if we all, everyone in the room, had attended the same funeral together.\u201d Judith, whose son was expelled, said that at first her son did not tell her about the complaint against him, thinking he could handle it alone. She found out when he was taken to a hospital, suicidal. She described herself as a lifelong Democrat and feminist who went to college in the 1970s at the height of the sexual revolution and women\u2019s liberation movements. Her husband and their two sons were \u201csuper respectful\u201d of women, she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t really need to teach our sons not to rape,\u201d she said. Four years after being kicked out of school, she said, her son is leading a \u201cdouble life,\u201d unable to confide in colleagues at work, and avoiding college classmates and his hometown. Gloria Davidson, whose daughter, Jessica, runs End Rape on Campus, said that as the mother of a 21-year-old son, she could empathize with the mothers of accused students \u2014 to a point. \u201cAny mother is watching out for the children, that\u2019s what mothers do,\u201d Ms. Davidson said. \u201cBut I think all mothers should get the facts and open their eyes to what could have happened or not.\u201d Few mothers have been as public and assertive as Ms. Seefeld. In 2010 her son, Mr. Warner, learned he had been accused of sexual assault by a fellow student at the University of North Dakota. Mr. Warner contended that the sex was consensual, but he was suspended and banned from campus for three years. His mother leveraged the connections she had developed over years as a high school psychology and sociology teacher in Fargo, and as a union leader. She contacted the State Board of Higher Education and visited state legislators. Hearing that the university was about to start a fund-raising drive, and thus would not want bad publicity, Ms. Seefeld said, she emailed its president about 9 p.m. one night. She wrote that she had hired a lawyer to look into suing the university, and a public relations firm to help her publicize her son\u2019s case, she said. \u201cWithin 30 minutes I heard from the president,\u201d she said, and he told her the case would be reviewed. A spokesman for the university declined to comment. But university documents provided by Ms. Seefeld show that the school did review the verdict, and nullified it because of a new development: The police said that they had found inconsistencies in the accuser\u2019s account and that some witnesses had contradicted it. They issued a warrant for her arrest on a charge of filing a false police report. (The woman left the state and has not been arrested. She did not respond to telephone messages.) Realizing she was not alone, Ms. Seefeld helped found FACE, the advocacy group for accused students. She said the group does not want to attack women. But if the mothers do not defend their sons, she said, who will? \u201cI just thought it was so wrong, and I thought how could anybody let this stand,\u201d she said of her son\u2019s punishment. \u201cAnd pretty much the most significant weapon I had was the weapon of public opinion, so that was the weapon I was wielding the hardest.\u201d",

      "author": "Katie Benner",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Attorney General Jeff Sessions made clear on Monday that the Justice Department will oppose colleges and universities that stifle free speech on campus, a cause championed by conservatives who say their voices are silenced in higher education. \u201cToday, freedom of speech and thought have come most under attack on the college campus,\u201d Mr. Sessions said at a forum on free speech in higher education hosted by the Justice Department. \u201cThe most important time to defend a valued right is when it is being attacked or eroded.\u201d Mr. Sessions said the Justice Department has written so-called statements of interest in four lawsuits against colleges and universities over free speech-related cases, including at the University of California, Berkeley; Pierce College in Los Angeles; Gwinnett College in Georgia; and the University of Michigan. The Justice Department has sided with students in the cases who say campus policies have stifled their ability to speak freely. Mr. Sessions said the statements of interest, legal tools used to interject the federal government in private disputes, have had an effect. Michigan changed its policy, and in other cases, judges allowed the lawsuits to go forward after the Justice Department stepped in, he said. Mr. Sessions cast the Justice Department\u2019s decision to act in grand terms, painting a picture of a society at risk of ceding its fundamental freedom to tyrannical elements that police speech. \u201cWe have reached a pivotal, perhaps even an historic, moment,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is time to stand up to the bullies on campus and in our culture.\u201d His language amplified an increasingly popular argument among conservatives that right-wing thought has long been stifled, especially on college campuses. \u201cFree speech shouldn\u2019t be a partisan issue, but it has been drawn into the larger dynamics of polarization in this country,\u201d said James Kirchick, a free speech advocate and a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution. Justice Department officials at the event said they did not aim to make free speech a partisan issue. \u201cSome may be skeptical of the division\u2019s motives or the cases in which we have gotten involved,\u201d said John Gore, the acting head of the Justice Department\u2019s civil rights division. \u201cWe in the civil rights division are proud to stand on the side of the First Amendment on behalf of students, faculty, staff, groups and anyone else whose speech has been stifled, stymied, sanctioned or suppressed by unconstitutional campus speech codes.\u201d But Sam Spital, the director of litigation at the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc., said the department was \u201cengaged in an ongoing attack on civil rights.\u201d \u201cUniversities have anti-discrimination and anti-harassment policies for good reasons,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cCampuses that are predominately white can be very isolating for students of color, and having speakers on campus who champion ideas of white supremacy create hostile environments that pose a concrete and urgent threat to all students having an equal opportunity to learn on campus.\u201d The Justice Department\u2019s support for campus free-speech cases could help change what Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee and the chairman of the Senate Education Committee, described as increasing skepticism among conservatives that college is a worthy pursuit. \u201cI\u2019m as a big a defender of our system of higher education as exists,\u201d Mr. Alexander said, but trampling on free speech \u201cwill undermine it.\u201d Mr. Alexander, an influential voice on education policy, said at the forum that colleges need to recruit not only underrepresented minorities but also underrepresented viewpoints. During the forum, Justice Department officials and several speakers also recast the fight for free speech, which has long been associated with progressives, as a fight against liberals who are interfering with conservatives\u2019 First Amendment rights. In the lawsuit against the University of Michigan, students took on the school\u2019s effort to forbid harassment and bullying and other acts motivated by bias that could be interpreted as demeaning or hurtful. \u201cThese rules, it seems, are enforced by a group of campus bureaucrats and campus police with the Orwellian name of the Bias Response Team, or B.R.T.,\u201d Mr. Sessions said. Conservative views are well established in government, of course; Republicans control Congress as well as the White House, and a conservative legal organization, the Federalist Society, has grown in power in recent years, vetting President Trump\u2019s picks for the federal courts, including Brett M. Kavanaugh, his Supreme Court nominee. And the conservative student group Turning Point USA hosted a high school leadership gathering in Washington this summer, where Mr. Sessions spoke, along with Secretary of Education Betsy and Nikki R. Haley, the ambassador to the United Nations. In a separate speech on Monday, Ms. DeVos called out Arkansas State University and Lawrence University in Wisconsin for policies that she said stifled free speech, indicating that the Department of Education is also monitoring schools for speech violations. But unlike Mr. Sessions, Ms. DeVos said it was not her department\u2019s place to use the power of the federal government to go after the schools. Rather, she said, \u201cwhat\u2019s happening on campuses today is symptomatic of a civic sickness.\u201d \u201cNo one wants to be wrong,\u201d Ms. DeVos said. \u201cIt is much easier to feel comfortable in saying there is no truth, nothing that could challenge what we want to believe.\u201d",

Says It Will Scale Back Civil Rights InvestigationsThe department will not consider civil rights investigations mandatory, loosening rules that spurred broad looks at issues from sexual assault to disciplinary actions.By Erica L. GreenPRINT EDITIONEducation Dept. Plans to Scale Back Its Civil Rights Investigations|June 17, 2017, Page A19",
      "author": "Erica L. Green",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 The Department of Education is scaling back investigations into civil rights violations at the nation\u2019s public schools and universities, easing off mandates imposed by the Obama administration that the new leadership says have bogged down the agency. According to an internal memo issued by Candice E. Jackson, the acting head of the department\u2019s office for civil rights, requirements that investigators broaden their inquiries to identify systemic issues and whole classes of victims will be scaled back. Also, regional offices will no longer be required to alert department officials in Washington of all highly sensitive complaints on issues such as the disproportionate disciplining of minority students and the mishandling of sexual assaults on college campuses. The new directives are the first steps taken under Education Secretary Betsy DeVos to reshape her agency\u2019s approach to civil rights enforcement, which was bolstered while President Barack Obama was in office. The efforts during Mr. Obama\u2019s administration resulted in far-reaching investigations and resolutions that required schools and colleges to overhaul policies addressing a number of civil rights concerns. That approach sent complaints soaring, and the civil rights office found itself understaffed and struggling to meet the department\u2019s stated goal of closing cases within 180 days. The office\u2019s processing times have \u201cskyrocketed,\u201d the Education Department spokeswoman, Liz Hill, said, adding that its backlog of cases has \u201cexploded.\u201d The new guidelines were to ensure that \u201cevery individual complainant gets the care and attention they deserve,\u201d she said. In the memo, which was first published by ProPublica, Ms. Jackson emphasized that the new protocols were aimed at resolving cases quickly. \u201cJustice delayed is justice denied, and justice for many complainants has been denied for too long,\u201d Ms. Hill said in a statement. But civil rights leaders believe that the new directives will have the opposite effect. They say that Education Department staff members would be discouraged from opening cases and that investigations could be weakened because efficiency would take priority over thoroughness. \u201cIf we want to have assembly-line justice, and I say \u2018justice\u2019 in quotes, then that\u2019s the direction that we should go,\u201d said Catherine Lhamon, who was the assistant secretary of the Education Department\u2019s civil rights office under Mr. Obama, and who now heads the United States Commission on Civil Rights. The commission \u2014 an independent, bipartisan agency charged with advising the president and Congress on matters of civil rights \u2014 voted on Friday to conduct a two-year investigation of federal civil rights enforcement, saying it had \u201cgrave concerns\u201d about the Trump administration\u2019s agenda. The commission identified the Education Department as an agency that was particularly troubling. Nevertheless, the department\u2019s move was lauded by advocates who believe that the office for civil rights has been overzealous in its enforcement activities in recent years. Robert Shibley, the executive director of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, an advocacy group, said the measures will be welcomed on college campuses where the department has overstepped in carrying out sexual assault investigations. The organization is financially supporting a lawsuit against the department over a letter issued in 2011 directing campuses to change the burden of proof in cases of sexual assault. \u201cSo many of the campus hearings are kangaroo courts with low due process, and you can\u2019t really have any confidence in the outcomes,\u201d Mr. Shibley said. Both sides of the civil rights issue keyed on the department\u2019s decision to reverse its practice of automatically broadening investigations and scrutinizing years of data, searching for patterns of violations. The practice of systematic reviews, which Ms. Lhamon supported while leading the civil rights office, uncovered significant evidence of discrimination in school districts. \u201cIt\u2019s really a way of curtailing the way civil rights enforcement should be handled,\u201d Ms. Lhamon said, reacting to the department\u2019s new direction. \u201cIt\u2019s literally a stick your head in the sand approach.\u201d For example, the department received a complaint that a black student at the Lodi Unified School District in California, about an hour south of Sacramento, received harsher punishment than a white student after the two were in a fight. According to a published settlement agreement, the investigation found that schools with higher percentages of black students established stricter punishment for discipline incidents, and a review of four years of data revealed that black students across the district received disproportionately higher levels of discipline than white students. But Mr. Shibley said the practice of systematic reviews was a significant burden, especially on colleges and universities, which sometimes had to review years of previous sexual assault complaints, and remedy anything they were found to have mishandled. \u201cThat was quite alarming from a double jeopardy and civil liberties perspective,\u201d Mr. Shibley said. Since her appointment as the education secretary, Ms. DeVos has come under fire from lawmakers and civil rights advocates for her remarks about the department\u2019s role in enforcing civil rights laws in the public school system. The office is charged with enforcing legal prohibitions against discrimination by race, color, national origin, sex and disability. Ms. DeVos has denounced discrimination in any form and has said schools that receive federal funds must follow federal laws. But she also believes in a limited federal role in education. She has signaled that her office is \u201cnot going to be issuing any decrees\u201d on civil rights and that those should come from Congress or the courts. In the memo issued last week, Ms. Jackson wrote that the department would \u201crobustly enforce the civil rights laws under our jurisdiction, and we will do so in a neutral, impartial manner and as efficiently as possible.\u201d Ms. Jackson issued another internal memo last week about how her office would respond to cases of discrimination after the rollback of Obama administration rules that encouraged states to allow transgender students to use the bathroom corresponding to their gender identity. Ms. Hill, the department spokeswoman, declined to release the internal document, but said it guides staff members on how to \u201cfunctionally execute on these cases.\u201d Transgender cases will be investigated by the department \u201cfully and fairly\u201d and will not be dismissed or referred because of a lack of guidance. However, the office has indicated that it will also be more judicious in tackling complaints in general. In the administration\u2019s budget request for the fiscal year that begins in October, the Education Department has proposed cutting more than 40 staff positions from the office for civil rights, which would require the office to \u201cmake difficult choices, including cutting back on initiating proactive investigations,\u201d the department wrote.",

GreenPRINT EDITIONJustices\u2019 Ruling Could Shape Future of School Choice, Voucher Advocates Say|June 28, 2017, Page A16",
      "author": "Erica L. Green",
      "content": " A Supreme Court ruling that a church-run preschool must be granted publicly funded tire scraps for its playground seemed on Monday to be narrowly drawn, attracting even the votes of two of the court\u2019s liberal justices, Elena Kagan and Stephen G. Breyer. But school choice advocates across the nation saw the decision as a game changer in the divisive debate over publicly funded vouchers for private religious schools. And their judgment seemed validated on Tuesday when the legal ramifications began to reshape education debates across the country. The Supreme Court on Tuesday sent two cases back to state courts for reconsideration in light of the ruling for Trinity Lutheran Church in Columbia, Mo. One of those cases concerned a program in Colorado \u2014 ruled unconstitutional by the state\u2019s highest court \u2014 that awarded public funds to help families cover tuition at private schools, including sectarian ones. The Supreme Court regularly sends back pending cases for a re-airing after it renders decisions that seem legally relevant, but such a move does mean that the court believes there is a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that a lower court may come to a different decision in light of its findings. In the Trinity opinion, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., writing for the majority, held that the Missouri ruling against aiding the church \u201cexpressly discriminates against otherwise eligible recipients by disqualifying them from a public benefit solely because of their religious character.\u201d To voucher advocates, that language was cause for celebration. \u201cThis is a tremendous development for school choice,\u201d said Michael Bindas, senior attorney at the Institute for Justice, who is representing families who lost scholarships in the Colorado case. \u201cIt shows the court takes the principle of neutrality toward religion in public benefits programs very seriously. We\u2019re very confident that the Colorado Supreme Court may come to the correct decision.\u201d Tuesday\u2019s move by the Supreme Court should prompt a reconsideration of the Colorado Supreme Court\u2019s 2015 judgment that the Choice Scholarship Program violated a provision in the state\u2019s Constitution that prohibits public funding to \u201chelp support or sustain any school\u201d that is \u201ccontrolled by any church or sectarian denomination.\u201d The court also sent a case back to the Supreme Court of New Mexico, which had upheld the exclusion of religious and private schools from a state textbook-lending program based on a similar constitutional provision. Colorado and Missouri are among 39 states that have strict prohibitions on public funds\u2019 going to religious schools, known as Blaine Amendments, which voucher advocates consider the last line of defense for opponents of private school choice. Leslie Hiner, vice president for programs at EdChoice, a group that supports private school choice, said she believed the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions were weakening that line. In a handful of states, school choice advocates have successfully challenged the prohibitions, arguing that once money is in the hands of families, how they spend it is a private matter. In the Colorado case, the Supreme Court ultimately rejected this argument. \u201cAnyone who is trying to move school choice in states that have Blaine Amendments should feel the freedom to move forward in understanding that no longer just the simple fact that a school may be religious is a reason to deny a child a quality education,\u201d Ms. Hiner said. Voucher opponents, however, considered the narrow scope of the Supreme Court decision to be an indication that the court was not interested in taking on the fundamental church-state divide. \u201cIt is crystal clear that the court here avoided the larger constitutional issue,\u201d said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, who said the opinion \u201ccannot be read as opening the door for states to promote religion or expand vouchers.\u201d In a footnote of the majority opinion, Chief Justice Roberts seemed to back that up. \u201cThis case involves express discrimination based on religious identity with respect to playground resurfacing,\u201d the footnote read. \u201cWe do not address religious uses of funding or other forms of discrimination.\u201d Lily Eskelsen Garcia, president of the National Education Association, called the ruling a \u201csetback\u201d for school voucher proponents. The association filed an amicus brief in the Trinity case in favor of the state, and argued that its constitutional provision should be upheld. Ms. Garcia said she applauded the \u201ccourt\u2019s refusal to accept the invitation of voucher proponents to issue a broad ruling that could place in jeopardy the ability of states to protect their public education system.\u201d But school choice advocates remained undeterred. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos celebrated the Trinity decision as a victory for the school choice movement, which has gained momentum and stands to expand under the Trump administration. The president\u2019s budget features a $1.4 billion school choice package that includes millions of dollars in vouchers that low-income families could use to send their children to private, religious schools. Ms. DeVos, a staunch supporter of vouchers who attended and sent her children to religious schools, said the decision affirmed that \u201creligious discrimination in any form cannot be tolerated in a society that values the First Amendment.\u201d \u201cWe should all celebrate the fact that programs designed to help students will no longer be discriminated against by the government based solely on religious affiliation,\u201d Ms. DeVos said. The Trinity Lutheran Church Child Learning Center had been operated by the church since 1985, and the roughly 90 2- to 5-year-olds come from a range of religions. The center applied for $20,000 to resurface its playground from a scrap tire program run by Missouri\u2019s Department of Natural Resources. While the center ranked highest among grant applicants, the department rejected its application because it was a religious institution. \u201cThe consequence is, in all likelihood, a few extra scraped knees,\u201d Chief Justice Roberts wrote. \u201cBut the exclusion of Trinity Lutheran from a public benefit for which it is otherwise qualified, solely because it is a church, is odious to our Constitution all the same, and cannot stand.\u201d But in a dissenting opinion, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, argued that the decision was not just about a playground. The opinion noted that the center advertised that the learning center serves as \u201ca ministry of the church and incorporates daily religion and developmentally appropriate activities.\u201d Justice Sotomayor said the Trinity decision blurred the lines between church and state, and was a \u201cradical mistake.\u201d",

      "author": "Emmarie Huetteman",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 On Tuesday, call him the tiebreaker. A vice president does not have much on his plate, as far as constitutional responsibilities go. He presides over the official count of electoral votes once, possibly twice, and, in the meantime, he waits in the wings in case the president becomes incapacitated. But Vice President Mike Pence is expected to demonstrate the position\u2019s unique duty, and in historic fashion: In his capacity as president of the Senate, he is expected to cast the deciding vote to confirm Betsy DeVos as President Trump\u2019s education secretary \u2014 the first time a vice president has had to resolve a tie on a cabinet nomination in the nation\u2019s history. Allowed to vote only when the Senate is deadlocked, vice presidents have a long history of settling disputes. John Adams, for instance, cast votes that helped determine the location of the United States capital and averted war with Britain. Ahead of Mr. Pence\u2019s potential vote, here is a look back at a few crucial moments in modern vice-presidential tiebreaking. Dick Cheney broke the last tie, according to the secretary of the Senate. On March 13, 2008, he broke a 50-50 split on an early procedural vote as Congress worked on a federal budget. Parachuting in from the campaign trail, three presidential contenders were on hand to cast their own votes that day: Senators John McCain, Republican of Arizona; Hillary Clinton, Democrat of New York; and Barack Obama, Democrat of Illinois. In his eight years as vice president during the Obama administration, Joseph R. Biden Jr. never settled a deadlocked vote, although there was speculation at one point that he would be called in to help confirm Loretta Lynch as attorney general when her nomination stalled in 2015. (She was ultimately confirmed 56 to 43.) Mr. Cheney cast eight tiebreaking votes in total \u2014 more than any other vice president since Richard M. Nixon\u2019s stint as No. 2. Mr. Cheney\u2019s first two opportunities came less than three months into George W. Bush\u2019s presidency. On April 3, 2001, Mr. Cheney settled his first tie, beating back a Democratic plan to reduce the president\u2019s proposed tax cuts to cover the cost of Medicare prescription drug coverage. It is perhaps more remarkable, though, that Mr. Cheney did not have more ties to break: When he was sworn in, the Senate was evenly split, with 50 Democrats and 50 Republicans, meaning any party-line vote could have necessitated a visit from the vice president. The Senate currently has 52 Republicans, 46 Democrats and two independents (who choose to caucus \u2014 and frequently vote \u2014 with the Democrats). While these votes are often seen as a dutiful nod to the president, there have been times when they could be seen as a boon to the vice president, too. In May 1999, Al Gore cast his last of four tiebreaking votes, helping pass an amendment to require background checks on all sales of firearms at gun shows. At the time, Mr. Gore was in the midst of his ill-fated run for president. In the final weeks of the race, he cited that vote in a 60-second campaign ad, part of a biographical spot intended to highlight his principled stances on issues important to working families. \u201cAs vice president, he defied the gun lobby and cast the tiebreaking vote to keep guns away from criminals,\u201d the announcer intoned. It has been more than three decades since the last vice-presidential tiebreaker on a presidential nomination \u2014 settling a deadlock over a nominee who, like Ms. DeVos, had become the subject of a bitter political fight. In 1986, President Ronald Reagan appointed Daniel A. Manion, a lawyer and former Indiana legislator who had little experience in federal courts and whose father was a founder of the far-right John Birch Society, to a federal appellate court. The nomination quickly became a tense tug of war between Reagan and Senate Democrats, who argued Mr. Manion was deeply unqualified. On July 23, 1986, Vice President George Bush put the matter to rest, siding with Republicans. \u201cWe won by one vote,\u201d Reagan said afterward. \u201cA little lynch mob had organized resistance against his nomination.\u201d",

      "author": "Erica L. Green",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 An analysis by the Education Department has found that its proposed new rules for handling allegations of sexual misconduct on campus would substantially decrease the number of investigations by colleges and school districts into complaints of sexual harassment, assault and rape, and save educational institutions millions of dollars over the next decade. The analysis was conducted to study the effect of proposals drawn up by Betsy DeVos, the education secretary, to overhaul regulations governing Title IX, the federal law that prohibits sex discrimination in federally funded schools. The proposed regulations, which have not been officially published but were previously reported on by The New York Times, seek to bolster the rights of students accused of sexual harassment, reduce liability for institutions and require schools to provide more support to victims. The analysis, included in a draft regulation, uses limited data available to the department to estimate the nationwide impact of the proposed changes. The department projected that colleges and universities currently conduct an average of 1.18 sexual harassment investigations each per year, and that under the new rule, the figure would fall to 0.72 investigations per year, a decline of 39 percent. There are about 6,000 colleges and universities nationwide. While the average number of Title IX investigations is not tracked at the elementary and secondary school level, the department drew data on sexual harassment episodes from its most recent civil rights data collection to conclude that the school districts currently investigate an average of 3.23 episodes per year. That rate, they estimated, would decrease to 1.61 under the new rules, a decline of 50 percent. There are about 17,000 elementary and secondary school districts. Among the most significant changes in the proposed rules would be the department\u2019s move to clarify and narrow the scope of complaints that schools are obligated to investigate. The rules require that institutions investigate only formal complaints that are filed with an authority figure, and no longer require that schools investigate complaints alleging conduct that occurred off campus or outside their school-sponsored programs. The rules also allow schools to address more complaints through informal resolutions. Those specific limitations, department officials wrote, would drive down the bulk of the complaints, and generate savings to the tune of $19 million for colleges and universities and $54 million for school districts. The entire regulation, the department projected, would save $327.7 million to $408.9 million over the next decade. Elizabeth Hill, a spokeswoman for the department, said the regulation \u201cis still under development, and therefore it\u2019s too early to speculate the cost of a new rule.\u201d \u201cThe substance of our proposal will not be built on any supposed financial impact and has played no role in Secretary DeVos\u2019s decision making,\u201d Ms. Hill said. \u201cSecretary DeVos has been clear that the rule must be built on protecting all students from unfair deprivation of their education, empowering complainants to seek a remedy that meets their needs, aligning regulatory requirements with the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of Title IX, and reducing federal micromanagement of schools.\u201d The draft document has to be vetted by the White House\u2019s Office of Management and Budget, which will conduct its own economic impact analysis before the department formally publishes the rule for public comment. Victims rights advocates said the proposed regulations ignored the most significant cost. \u201cIt strikes me that one thing that\u2019s not included in the cost is the one in five women dropping out of school because their school won\u2019t investigate their complaints of sexual violence, and that is a cost that affects everybody,\u201d said Adaku Onyeka-Crawford, senior counsel for education at the National Women\u2019s Law Center. But Kimberly C. Lau, a lawyer who represents accused students at the New York law firm Warshaw Burstein, said equating the decline in investigations to a lack of regard for complainants \u201cmisses the big picture.\u201d \u201cThe decline in investigations may decrease the pressure on schools to be results-oriented in their approach and more focused on how the process is implemented,\u201d Ms. Lau said. \u201cIf the department is focused on the process, then the right outcomes will naturally result one way or another.\u201d The proposed regulations would replace temporary guidance put in place last fall when Ms. DeVos rescinded a pair of controversial documents issued under the Obama administration that outlined how schools should meet their legal obligations to address episodes of sexual misconduct. In its draft, the Education Department wrote that the Obama-era guidance \u201cmade institutions liable for conduct of which they were unaware,\u201d and that the rules exceeded existing laws by \u201crequiring institutions to respond to conduct less severe than proscribed by Title IX.\u201d The Obama-era guidelines were hailed by supporters for aggressively protecting victims \u2014 but were not legally binding \u2014 and assailed by critics as trampling on the due process rights of the accused. In the days after Ms. DeVos\u2019s newly proposed regulations were publicized, Obama officials denounced the characterization of their efforts. Catherine E. Lhamon, who led the Education Department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights in the Obama administration, said the impact analysis showed that the new administration was \u201caspiring to reduce the number of times a school investigates, rather than aspiring to reduce the number of harms that students experience.\u201d In the draft analysis, Education Department officials wrote that they had not tracked how many schools had changed their Title IX enforcement practices after the September 2017 rescission of the Obama-era guidance, but believed that many had not. Department officials wrote that while they anticipated 90 percent of elementary and secondary schools would save money as a result of the new requirements, they anticipated that only 50 percent of colleges and universities would because \u201cvarious pressures will result in the retention of the status quo in every manner that is permitted under the proposed regulation.\u201d Department officials acknowledged that its estimates were based on several assumptions, and that concrete and uniform data on sexual harassment investigations was lacking. Officials said they hoped public feedback would refine their estimates. The analysis also accounts for new costs that colleges and districts could incur. Although schools are not required to investigate every complaint, a Title IX coordinator is still required to respond to reports and provide support to victims, which the department anticipates will cost about $5 million. The rules require schools to offer victims a range of \u201csupportive measures,\u201d even if they choose not to file a formal complaint, such as counseling, changes in housing and other efforts that are devised to help them continue their education. The impact analysis does not specifically account for how investigations could be affected by the narrower Supreme Court definition of sexual harassment that the department plans to adopt. The new definition defines it as \u201cunwelcome conduct on the basis of sex that is so severe, pervasive and objectively offensive that it denies a person access to the school\u2019s education program or activity.\u201d The draft regulations would allow a school to dismiss a Title IX complaint if it does not meet the new definition of sexual harassment, even if the conduct is proved to be true. The proposed regulations would hold institutions liable only for \u201cactual knowledge\u201d of a complaint, meaning that it was formally filed with an official with the \u201cauthority to institute corrective measures\u201d on behalf of the school. The proposal would also require that schools be held to a new standard called \u201cdeliberately indifferent\u201d in determining whether schools properly addressed complaints. That standard, also drawn from Supreme Court precedent, means a school could be found in violation of civil rights law \u201conly if its response to the sexual harassment is clearly unreasonable in light of known circumstances.\u201d Among the questions the department plans to pose to the public are whether some parts of the rule should apply only to higher education versus elementary and secondary schools, and whether they should be adjusted for specific groups like employees and students with disabilities.",

GreenPRINT EDITIONNational Analysis Sees Bias in Discipline|April 5, 2018, Page A17",
      "author": "Erica L. Green",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Black students continue to be disciplined at school more often and more harshly than their white peers, often for similar infractions, according to a new report by Congress\u2019s nonpartisan watchdog agency, which counters claims fueling the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to re-examine discipline policies of the Obama administration. The report, issued by the Government Accountability Office on Wednesday, is the first national governmental analysis of discipline policies since the Obama administration issued guidance in 2014 that urged schools to examine the disproportionate rates at which black students were being punished. Critics of the Obama-era guidance have questioned whether students of color suffer from unfair treatment under school discipline policies. The G.A.O. found that not only have black students across the nation continued to bear the brunt of such policies, but the effects were also felt more widely than previously reported \u2014 including by black students in affluent schools. Additionally, the agency found that school suspensions began to fall the year before the Obama administration urged schools to move away from the overuse of such measures, undermining claims that the guidance forced schools to cut suspensions. While the Obama administration\u2019s aggressive civil rights investigations did reveal that black students were subjected to harsher treatment than their white peers for similar infractions, the G.A.O. found that it did not impose any new mandates on districts to reduce their suspension rates. The findings are likely to bolster arguments for preserving the 2014 guidance and undercut conservative claims that the guidance has resulted in federal overreach and a decline in school safety. On Wednesday, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos hosted groups of educators and advocates for and against the disciplinary guidance, the 12th set of round tables the department has held in the past year \u2014 and the first Ms. DeVos attended in person. Nina Leuzzi, a prekindergarten teacher at a Boston charter school, said she kept her word to her class of 20, predominantly minority 4-year-olds, in making her case to the secretary for why the guidance should stay. When the children asked her why she was traveling to Washington, she told them it was to keep them safe. \u201cRescinding this would send the message that there is no longer a concern about discrimination in our schools,\u201d Ms. Leuzzi said. Nicole Stewart, a former vice principal in San Diego, told Ms. DeVos that pressures to reduce suspensions had made schools dangerous. She said administrators did not expel a student with a knife at her school because he had a disability. Weeks later, he slit a student\u2019s throat, she said. \u201cIt is no wonder that our kids don\u2019t think that rules and consequences apply to them,\u201d Ms. Stewart said. \u201cWe are not modeling what consequences look like in the real world.\u201d Ms. DeVos is facing new pressures after Republicans linked the guidance to the February mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., and President Trump assigned her to lead a school safety commission that will consider whether to repeal the guidance. Ms. DeVos has declined to say publicly whether she believes that racial bias plays a role in the disproportionate rates at which black students are punished in school. But according to attendees at Wednesday\u2019s meeting, the secretary opened her remarks by acknowledging that the conversations were taking place on the 50th anniversary of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s assassination, and that racial disparities in discipline were a problem in the country. Evan Stone, co-founder of Educators for Excellence, which represents nearly 30,000 educators across the country, said the acknowledgment gave him hope. \u201cStill, we have a real uphill battle ahead,\u201d said Mr. Stone, who attended the meeting with Ms. Leuzzi and five other teachers who are part of the group. Members of Congress urged Ms. DeVos not to make a decision on the guidance until the G.A.O. report was made public. The Education Department did not issue a response to the G.A.O. findings, as is customary, and did not respond to a request for comment on the report. The Obama administration guidance was issued based on data that showed that, in 2012, black students were being suspended at three times the rate of their white peers. According to the G.A.O. analysis, in the 2013-14 school year, black students accounted for 15.5 percent of all public school students, but represented about 39 percent of students suspended from school. The agency also found the disparities for black students started in preschool, and persisted regardless of the type of school they attended \u2014 disparities were particularly acute in charter schools \u2014 or the disciplinary action they received. And black students were the only race in which both boys and girls were disproportionately disciplined across six disciplinary actions examined, which included corporal punishment, in- and out-of-school suspensions, expulsions and school-related arrests. Moreover, the agency found that black students were suspended more often than their white peers in schools of all poverty levels. In the most affluent schools, 7.5 percent of black boys had been given out-of-school suspensions, while 1.8 percent of white boys had. The finding marks the first time that national discipline rates have been analyzed by poverty level, and challenges a common claim that poverty, more than race, may be driving disproportionate rates of disciplinary actions. Daniel J. Losen, director of the Center for Civil Rights Remedies at the University of California at Los Angeles\u2019s Civil Rights Project, called the finding \u201cgroundbreaking.\u201d He said it affirms other research that shows that even black boys raised in rich neighborhoods were likely to earn less than their white peers. \u201cThis further shows that poverty is not explaining the disparities,\u201d Mr. Losen said. \u201cThere\u2019s a racial discrimination problem, and that can no longer be disputed.\u201d The G.A.O. analysis was requested by Representative Robert C. Scott, Democrat of Virginia, and Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York. The agency was charged with identifying patterns in disciplinary actions among public schools, the challenges that school districts faced with discipline reform, and how the Departments of Education and Justice have addressed the issue through enforcement measures. The investigation took place from November 2016 through March, and included data analysis and interviews with officials in the Education and Justice Departments, as well as district leaders in five states. The report was praised by Democratic lawmakers as evidence that the 2014 guidance had value. The guidance informed schools that wide racial disparities could signal discriminatory practices that could result in a federal investigation and loss of federal funding. It also suggested a number of strategies for managing nonviolent behavior without resorting to kicking students out of school. \u201cThe G.A.O.\u2019s first-of-its-kind analysis confirms that racial bias contributes to pervasive discipline disparities,\u201d Mr. Scott and Mr. Nadler said in a joint statement. \u201cThe G.A.O.\u2019s findings underscore the need to strengthen the guidance, not rescind it as some have recommended.\u201d But critics who want to see the Obama-era guidance rescinded said the report\u2019s scope was too narrow to draw broad conclusions. \u201cNone of these findings change the basic story line,\u201d said Michael J. Petrilli, the president of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, a research organization. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve learned is discipline reform is being applied unevenly. If you are concerned there are some specific districts and schools that are responding particularly poorly to this, I don\u2019t think this study gets at that question.\u201d Mr. Petrilli also said the report did not answer the question at the heart of the Obama-guidance criticism: whether racial bias accounted for all the disparities. The G.A.O. examination illustrated how racial bias was unfolding in some districts. For instance, at a school district in Kentucky where black students were 10 times as likely as white students to be disciplined, school officials acknowledged that 61 types of violations were undefined, which allowed staff to punish black students more harshly. In interviews, district officials also reported that they maintained broad discretion in how they disciplined students, and that more serious offenses, like those concerning weapons, violence and drugs, still resulted in removing students from school. And all of the school districts reported that while they embraced the opportunity to revise their approach to discipline, their biggest barrier was not student behavior. It was the lack of resources to tackle cases of trauma and mental health issues that increasingly plague the nation\u2019s children.",

      "author": "Emmarie Huetteman",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Emboldened by weeks of protests across the country, congressional Democrats are digging in as Republicans try to swiftly remake a government shaped by the Obama administration. Tensions over President Trump\u2019s early efforts to deliver on a long menu of campaign promises have spilled into the halls of Congress, turning once-routine debates into a proxy battle over a combative president. With the Senate already hinting it could work through the weekend, expect another busy week at the Capitol. Let us get you up to speed. \u25a0 Vice President Mike Pence could well be needed to break a 50-50 tie in the Senate over the nomination of Betsy DeVos as education secretary. \u25a0 Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee for attorney general, Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, could be confirmed by the end of the week. \u25a0 Republicans in Congress will also vote to roll back Obama-era regulations. Mr. Pence may be summoned to the Capitol early this week to cast the 51st vote to confirm Ms. DeVos as education secretary over vociferous, now bipartisan objections. The Senate could vote on her nomination as late as Tuesday. Congressional trivia buffs, take note: It would be the first time that the vice president has been forced to cast a tiebreaking vote on a cabinet nomination, said Betty K. Koed, the Senate historian. Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska thrust Ms. DeVos\u2019s nomination into question last week when they became the first two Republicans to declare their opposition. Should the Democratic caucus vote as a bloc, their votes would set up a 50-50 tie that Mr. Pence would have to settle in his capacity as president of the Senate. The Capitol has been flooded with thousands of constituent calls and messages, many of them urging senators to vote against Ms. DeVos. Still, it looks unlikely that any more Republicans will defect, and that would be enough to confirm her. Once the Senate deals with the DeVos nomination, it will move on to the nomination of Mr. Sessions to be attorney general. First comes a procedural vote that sets the timer for up to 30 hours of debate before the final vote. That means Mr. Sessions\u2019s confirmation vote should come later this week, at which point the Senate will start the process over with the nomination of Representative Tom Price of Georgia to be secretary of health and human services, followed by a vote on the nomination of Steven T. Mnuchin to be Treasury secretary. Of course, just because Democrats may not have the votes to block Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet nominees does not mean they will go quietly. Having stacked up as many parliamentary roadblocks as they could find last week, Democrats are expected to take advantage of the mandatory debate time, probably to air their concerns about Mr. Trump\u2019s picks as well as grievances against their Republican counterparts, who they believe have stymied a thorough examination of some nominees. That could be bad news for senators with plans on Saturday: Republican leaders may keep the Senate in session over the weekend to get the job done. After dusting off  the Congressional Review Act last week, the House will use that momentum to continue rolling back recently finalized Obama-era regulations. On Tuesday, the House is scheduled to vote to toss out three rules: an Interior Department rule intended to increase transparency and public input on the use of public lands; an Education Department rule that spells out provisions of a recent education law regarding accountability; and another Education Department rule that sets the parameters for gathering and sharing data on teacher training programs. The Senate began taking up these regulations between nomination votes last week, and it is likely to continue this week, voting after the House to roll back each rule one by one before it is sent to the president. Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, the federal appeals court judge nominated by Mr. Trump for the Supreme Court, will continue his courtesy meetings with senators. Judge Gorsuch is expected to meet on Monday with Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, after having sat down last week with Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, and Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Ms. Feinstein has expressed reservations about Judge Gorsuch, as has Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, who said Mr. Trump\u2019s propensity for flouting \u201cthe rule of law\u201d demanded \u201can independent jurist.\u201d Two weeks after congressional Republicans and Senate Democrats ducked out for their policy retreats, the House Democratic caucus will slip away on Wednesday for its summit meeting in Baltimore. While Republicans spent part of their retreat debating \u2014 and occasionally fretting \u2014 about how to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, Democrats seem likely to strategize their response. Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader, has seized every recent opportunity to condemn Republican plans to get rid of the health care law, as Democrats continue to transmit a simple message across the aisle about the nation\u2019s health care system: If you break it, you buy it.",

Illegally Curbed Workers\u2019 Union Protections, Mediators SuggestThe advisory by the Federal Labor Relations Authority could ripple through the government, which the Trump administration has directed to implement similar rules.By Erica L. GreenPRINT EDITIONEducation Dept. Illegally Put Limits on Union Protections, Mediators Say|July 25, 2018, Page A15",
      "author": "Erica L. Green",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Federal labor mediators have advised the Education Department that it most likely imposed new work rules on its employees illegally, curtailing workers\u2019 protections and access to union representation in violation of federal law. The American Federation of Government Employees said Tuesday that the Federal Labor Relations Authority advised the Education Department that it had engaged in \u201cbad-faith bargaining\u201d when it implemented a contract this year that gutted compensation and benefits provisions for the department\u2019s 3,900 employees, and limited employees\u2019 ability to carry out union duties during the work day. The decision could have broad implications because the Education Department\u2019s actions mirror Trump administration efforts throughout the federal government. The Social Security Administration and the Department of Veterans Affairs have begun implementing work rules similar to the ones at the Education Department, union officials said. And many of the anti-union elements reflect a series of executive orders on the federal work force that President Trump signed in May. The union plans to use the finding as it pursues labor disputes across the federal government. \u201cFor the first salvo to be knocked down by the F.L.R.A., it sends the message that the government isn\u2019t going to be allowed to operate outside the bounds of the law,\u201d said David A. Borer, general counsel for the union. The Education Department imposed the contract after a year of contentious, intermittent talks with the union fell apart in February. Each side accused the other of refusing to show up at the bargaining table. In March, the department announced a \u201ccollective bargaining agreement\u201d that officials said reflected its final offer. The union contends that it had not negotiated any provisions, and therefore had agreed to nothing, making the department\u2019s imposition of its offer an \u201cillegal edict.\u201d It filed an unfair labor practices charge with the labor relations authority in March. Nathan Bailey, a spokesman for the Education Department, said the contract was imposed because \u201cthe union spent more than a year, dating back into the Obama administration, dragging its feet on ground rules for negotiations without reaching any agreement, and then failed to respond in a timely manner to negotiate over the contract proposed by the department.\u201d He declined to comment on the labor authority\u2019s advisory, citing pending litigation. But a senior department official said the labor authority had repeatedly ruled that federal agencies could unilaterally implement contracts if the union had failed to respond in a timely manner in contract negotiations, as the department argues happened in this case. The labor authority, an independent government agency that investigates and resolves government-labor disputes, currently has no general counsel and therefore cannot issue decisions that would allow the violation finding to be formally charged and litigated. But the decision, made by a regional director after a four-month investigation, reflects an independent finding by a civil servant that the union\u2019s case has merit. \u201cIt\u2019s a real spoke in the wheel in the government\u2019s attempt to destroy federal sector unions,\u201d Mr. Borer said. \u201cThis was the first salvo in what\u2019s become a broadening assault on federal unions, the rights of federal workers.\u201d A spokeswoman for the labor authority declined to comment because the agency does not comment on pending litigation. The union, which represents more than 700,000 federal government employees across 70 federal agencies, said the Education Department\u2019s contract put into force the president\u2019s vision for the federal work force. His executive orders, which were preceded by a series of anti-union statements in the president\u2019s budget, made it easier to fire government employees by overhauling evaluation and grievance processes, ordered agencies to renegotiate their union contracts to cut down on \u201cwaste,\u201d and pared back \u201cofficial time\u201d that government workers could use to represent employees. The union will receive its first court hearing on the matter on Wednesday, and Mr. Borer said he was hopeful that the advisory would bolster his case. Trump officials said the orders would help improve performance at historically dysfunctional agencies, like the Department of Veterans Affairs, and would rein in abuses of official time that allowed some employees to spend all their time on union activities. Administration officials said the measures would save the government at least $100 million a year. The contract imposed by the Education Department revoked provisions from previous contracts that outlined pay raises, performance evaluations, overtime, child care and work schedules. It also evicted union representatives from the department\u2019s offices and barred them from using government equipment. The new rules also require union representatives to get permission from their bosses to carry out their union duties. And they limit disputes that are subject to grievance procedures, while vastly expanding the kinds of disputes that are not. The work rules also eliminate an anti-retaliation guarantee. When the work rules were implemented, Liz Hill, a department spokeswoman, said they complied with all federal labor laws and that the goal was \u201cto treat all employees and the American taxpayers fairly.\u201d But union officials accused the department of \u201cunion busting.\u201d They noted that Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has long been a critic of labor unions \u2014 she has publicly traded barbs with the leaders of teachers\u2019 unions \u2014 and said the department has taken unprecedented measures to weaken the union\u2019s power and presence. The work rules were imposed during a tumultuous spring for department employees, as Ms. DeVos has sought to shrink and reorganize the agency. Ms. DeVos has been the most aggressive of the cabinet secretaries in following an executive order issued by Mr. Trump at the beginning of his administration that required cabinet heads to shrink the federal footprint. Ms. DeVos has cut staff by offering buyouts, has scattered expertise by reassigning a number of high-profile managers and has tried to break up the department\u2019s budget office. Some parts of the plan have drawn protests from the White House\u2019s Office of Management and Budget, and Congress has sought to halt parts of the reorganization through legislation. However, Ms. DeVos has won some praise for streamlining the department, including reducing the number of political appointees. In a May testimony before the House Education Committee, Ms. DeVos said her reorganization plan, which also included consolidating offices and streamlining the agency\u2019s functions, was created \u201cto more efficiently serve students and the taxpayer.\u201d \u201cThese reforms are not rooted in a partisan ideology, nor are they designed to benefit one group over another,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are focused solely on the students, parents and teachers I meet each week \u2014 and millions more like them.\u201d But union officials said the reorganization and the union contract was emblematic of the Trump administration\u2019s larger goal. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on at the Department of Education is what we can expect to see governmentwide from this president and his political appointees as they move to dismantle the government work force that supports our democracy,\u201d said J. David Cox Sr., the president of the union\u2019s national office.",

      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 The letters have come in to her office by the hundreds, heartfelt missives from college students, mostly men, who had been accused of rape or sexual assault. Some had lost scholarships. Some had been expelled. A mother stumbled upon her son trying to take his own life, recalled Candice E. Jackson, the top civil rights official at the Department of Education. \u201cListening to her talk about walking in and finding him in the middle of trying to kill himself because his life and his future were gone, and he was forever branded a rapist \u2014 that\u2019s haunting,\u201d said Ms. Jackson, describing a meeting with the mother of a young man who had been accused of sexual assault three months after his first sexual encounter. The young man, who maintained he was innocent, had hoped to become a doctor. In recent years, on campus after campus, from the University of Virginia to Columbia University, from Duke to Stanford, higher education has been roiled by high-profile cases of sexual assault accusations. Now Education Secretary Betsy DeVos is stepping into that maelstrom. On Thursday, she will meet in private with women who say they were assaulted, accused students and their families, advocates for both sides and higher education officials, the first step in a contentious effort to re-examine policies of President Barack Obama, who made expansive use of his powers to investigate the way universities and colleges handle sexual violence. How university and college administrations have dealt with campus sexual misconduct charges has become one of the most volatile issues in higher education, with many women saying higher education leaders have not taken their trauma seriously. But the Obama administration\u2019s response sparked a backlash, not just from the accused and their families but from well-regarded law school professors who say new rules went too far. In an interview previewing her plans, Ms. Jackson, who heads the Education Department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights and organized Thursday\u2019s sessions, made clear that she believes investigations under the 1972 law known as Title IX have gone deeply awry. A sexual assault survivor herself, she said she sees \u201ca red flag that something\u2019s not quite right\u201d \u2014 and that the rights of accused students have too often been ignored. Hundreds of cases are still pending, some for years, she said, because investigators were \u201cspecifically told to keep looking until you find the violation\u201d on college campuses even after they found none \u2014 a charge her critics strongly deny. As of Monday, the office had 496 open sexual assault cases, and the average length of a case is 703 days, according to the department. The longest pending higher education cases, against the University of Massachusetts-Amherst and Arizona State University, have been open for more than five years. The office is required to complete 80 percent of its investigations within 180 days. Investigative processes have not been \u201cfairly balanced between the accusing victim and the accused student,\u201d Ms. Jackson argued, and students have been branded rapists \u201cwhen the facts just don\u2019t back that up.\u201d In most investigations, she said, there\u2019s \u201cnot even an accusation that these accused students overrode the will of a young woman.\u201d \u201cRather, the accusations \u2014 90 percent of them \u2014 fall into the category of \u2018we were both drunk,\u2019 \u2018we broke up, and six months later I found myself under a Title IX investigation because she just decided that our last sleeping together was not quite right,\u2019\u201d Ms. Jackson said. Ms. Jackson later issued a statement clarifying that the conclusion was based on feedback from cases involving accused students, and even if complaints don\u2019t allege violence, \u201call sexual harassment and sexual assault must be taken seriously.\u201d Such comments infuriate advocates for victims and women, who have spent the last six years waging a concerted campaign to educate college administrators, and the public, on students\u2019 rights under the law, and how to combat what some have called \u201crape culture\u201d on campus. A 2015 survey commissioned by the Association of American Universities found that more than one in four women at a large group of leading universities said they had been sexually assaulted by force or when they were incapacitated while in college. \u201cWe took for granted the fact that the White House and the Department of Education supported accepting and advancing these rights, and we can\u2019t take that for granted anymore,\u201d said Michele Dauber, a professor at Stanford University Law School. \u201cThere is going to be a fight.\u201d Women\u2019s groups are girding for battle, and are outraged that some men\u2019s rights groups \u2014 including advocates they regard as misogynists \u2014 are being included in Thursday\u2019s sessions. Fatima Goss Graves, president of the National Women\u2019s Law Center, which is suing the Department of Education to obtain records related to Title IX, said she was \u201cworried that the department will turn into apologists for the sort of violence that happens on campus,\u201d and that the Trump administration would \u201callow myths about rape to be perpetuated\u201d \u2014 including, she said, \u201cthe whole idea that rape is just a drunken encounter gone wrong.\u201d Under pressure from the Obama administration, many universities overhauled their procedures for investigating sexual assault. But college administrators have been chafing against the strictures imposed by the Education Department, said Daniel Swinton, a top official with the Association of Title IX Administrators. Some rape cases have resulted in convictions, but others \u2014 such as a University of Virginia rape chronicled by Rolling Stone and another that ensnared the Duke University lacrosse team \u2014 fell apart under scrutiny. Appointed by Ms. DeVos in April, Ms. Jackson represented sexual assault victims as a private lawyer before joining the Education Department. She is best known for her involvement in attacks against Hillary Clinton during the presidential campaign, when she elevated women who had accused former President Bill Clinton of sexual assault or harassment, while denouncing women who accused Mr. Trump of such behavior. One question before her is whether to rescind a so-called Dear Colleague letter, issued by the Obama administration in April 2011, that put colleges and universities on notice that the federal government was going to be aggressive on sexual misconduct. The 19-page guidance warned schools they could lose millions in federal funding if they did not comply. Catherine E. Lhamon, who led the Education Department\u2019s civil rights office from August 2013 through December 2016, called Ms. Jackson\u2019s claims that investigators were told to fish for violations \u201cpatently, demonstrably untrue.\u201d For the department to distinguish between violent and nonviolent assaults in investigations, she added, \u201cportrays a profound misunderstanding of Title IX.\u201d Ms. Lhamon said investigations under her tenure turned up \u201cjaw-dropping degrees of noncompliance\u201d with sexual assault law. The most controversial part of the 2011 guidance mandated that college officials use a \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d standard, which makes it easier to find students responsible than a \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidence standard that some schools had been using. Advocates for the accused are pushing for Ms. Jackson to revoke the guidance and adopt the \u201cclear and convincing\u201d standard. One of those advocates is C. D. Mock, whose son, Corey, was accused of rape while a student at the University of Tennessee, Chattanooga, in the spring of 2014. The accusation led to a convoluted process of administrative hearings, Mr. Mock said, in which his son was at first found \u201cnot responsible,\u201d then expelled from school, and then readmitted by a judge after the family sued, but kicked off the school\u2019s wrestling team. Corey Mock graduated but was forced to abandon his dream of becoming a college wrestling coach, his father said. \u201cThe young men who have been accused have gone through an absolutely horrendous experience,\u201d his father said in an interview. \u201cThey have had their entire world turned upside down.\u201d A spokesman for the university declined to comment, citing pending litigation. The April 2011 guidance was only the first step in the Obama administration\u2019s efforts to hold universities accountable for the way they investigate sexual assault. In 2014, the Education Department published a list of schools that faced civil rights investigations related to sexual violence reports, which included some of the nation\u2019s elite Ivy League schools. Advocates saw the guidance, and the list, as powerful tools to raise awareness and persuade universities to take sexual assault complaints seriously. But Ms. Jackson said that college campus representatives have presented it to her as a \u201clist of shame\u201d that even identifies universities where sexual misconduct has not yet been found to have occurred. The department is still deciding whether it will continue publishing the list. Facing what they view as retrenchment by the federal government, some advocates for victims are turning to the courts. Among them is Debra Katz, who represents a feminist group at the University of Mary Washington in Virginia. The group filed a Title IX complaint with the civil rights office in 2015, after administration officials refused to investigate threatening messages sent over the now-defunct messaging app Yik Yak. Ms. Katz recently withdrew the complaint and sued the university instead. \u201cIt became very clear that this case was going to die on the vine,\u201d she said. Meanwhile, groups like Know Your IX, which teaches students their rights under the federal law, have been promoting a hashtag on Twitter, #DearBetsy, and asking people to post their personal stories about sexual assault on Twitter. Jessica Torres, a 27-year-old Democratic strategist, tweeted to Ms. DeVos that she had been raped as a student at Williams College. \u201cMy concern is we\u2019re going back to the years when women and queer students were absolutely terrified of coming forward,\u201d Ms. Torres said in an interview. Ms. Jackson said she planned to draw from her experiences in courtrooms across the country. \u201cWe have a justice system where nobody demands that the system itself be weighted in favor of a plaintiff,\u201d she said. \u201cIn principle, there is no reason to depart from setting up a Title IX discipline process on campus that is anything other than fairly balanced and doesn\u2019t prejudge and weight the system in favor of a finding. We don\u2019t do that in our court system, our criminal justice system, and I see no reason why we would want to do it in a campus system either.\u201d",

      "author": "Jeremy W. Peters",
      "content": "   WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump on Wednesday rescinded protections for transgender students that had allowed them to use bathrooms corresponding with their gender identity, overruling his own education secretary and placing his administration firmly in the middle of the culture wars that many Republicans have tried to leave behind. In a joint letter, the top civil rights officials from the Justice Department and the Education Department rejected the Obama administration\u2019s position that nondiscrimination laws require schools to allow transgender students to use the bathrooms of their choice. That directive, they said, was improperly and arbitrarily devised, \u201cwithout due regard for the primary role of the states and local school districts in establishing educational policy.\u201d The question of how to address the \u201cbathroom debate,\u201d as it has become known, opened a rift inside the Trump administration, pitting Education Secretary Betsy DeVos against Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Mr. Sessions, who had been expected to move quickly to roll back the civil rights expansions put in place under his Democratic predecessors, wanted to act decisively because of two pending court cases that could have upheld the protections and pushed the government into further litigation. But Ms. DeVos initially resisted signing off and told Mr. Trump that she was uncomfortable because of the potential harm that rescinding the protections could cause transgender students, according to three Republicans with direct knowledge of the internal discussions. Mr. Sessions, who has opposed expanding gay, lesbian and transgender rights, pushed Ms. DeVos to relent. After getting nowhere, he took his objections to the White House because he could not go forward without her consent. Mr. Trump sided with his attorney general, the Republicans said, and told Ms. DeVos in a meeting in the Oval Office on Tuesday that he wanted her to drop her opposition. And Ms. DeVos, faced with the alternative of resigning or defying the president, agreed to go along. Ms. DeVos\u2019s unease was evident in a strongly worded statement she released on Wednesday night, in which she said she considered it a \u201cmoral obligation\u201d for every school in America to protect all students from discrimination, bullying and harassment. She said she had directed the Education Department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights to investigate all claims of such treatment \u201cagainst those who are most vulnerable in our schools,\u201d but also argued that bathroom access was not a federal matter. Gay rights supporters made their displeasure clear. Outside the White House, several hundred people protested the decision, chanting, \u201cNo hate, no fear, trans students are welcome here.\u201d Individual schools will remain free to let transgender students use the bathrooms with which they are most comfortable. And the effect of the administration\u2019s decision will not be immediate because a federal court had already issued a nationwide injunction barring enforcement of the Obama order. The dispute highlighted the degree to which transgender rights issues, which Mr. Trump expressed sympathy for during the campaign, continue to split Republicans, even as many in the party argue that it is time to move away from social issues and focus more on bread-and-butter pocketbook concerns. Within the administration, it also threatened to become another distraction for Mr. Trump after a tumultuous first month in office. And it showed how Mr. Trump, who has taken a more permissive stance on gay rights and same-sex marriage than many of his fellow Republicans, is bowing to pressure from the religious right and contradicting his own personal views. Social conservatives, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s most loyal constituencies, applauded him for honoring a pledge he had made to them during the campaign. They had argued that former President Barack Obama\u2019s policy would allow potential sexual predators access to bathrooms and create an unsafe environment for children. \u201cThe federal government has absolutely no right to strip parents and local schools of their rights to provide a safe learning environment for children,\u201d said Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council. But supporters of transgender rights said the Trump administration was acting recklessly and cruelly. \u201cThe consequences of this decision will no doubt be heartbreaking,\u201d said Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a states\u2019 rights issue; it\u2019s a civil rights issue.\u201d Bathroom access emerged as a major and divisive issue last March when North Carolina passed a bill barring transgender people from using bathrooms that do not match the sex on their birth certificate. It was part of a broader bill eliminating anti-discrimination protections for gay and transgender people. Gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender issues became a point of attack for opponents of Ms. DeVos\u2019s nomination last month, as Democrats questioned her about the extensive financial support that some of her relatives \u2014 part of her wealthy and politically active Michigan family \u2014 had provided to anti-gay causes. Ms. DeVos distanced herself from her relatives on the issue, saying their political activities did not represent her views. While Wednesday\u2019s order significantly rolls back transgender protections, it does include language stating that schools must protect transgender students from bullying, a provision Ms. DeVos asked for, one person with direct knowledge of the process said. \u201cAll schools must ensure that students, including L.G.B.T. students, are able to learn and thrive in a safe environment,\u201d the letter said, echoing Ms. DeVos\u2019s comments at her confirmation hearing but not expressly using the word transgender. Ms. DeVos, who has been quietly supportive of gay rights for years, was said to have voiced her concern about the high rates of suicide among transgender students. In one 2016 study by the Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospital Medical Center, for instance, 30 percent reported a history of at least one suicide attempt. Mr. Trump appears to have been swayed by conservatives in his administration who reminded him that he had promised during the campaign to leave the question of bathroom use to the states. But he had given conflicting signals on the issue, and on gay rights more broadly. He said last April, for instance, that he supported the right of transgender people to \u201cuse the bathroom they feel is appropriate,\u201d and added that Caitlyn Jenner, perhaps the most famous transgender person in the country, could use whichever bathroom at Trump Tower she wanted. He has also called the Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage settled law. \u201cAnd I\u2019m fine with that,\u201d he told CBS News after the November election. Despite his personal views, Mr. Trump\u2019s decisions in office have been consistently conservative on social issues. And he has shown considerable deference to the religious right, naming many religious conservatives to top cabinet posts and pledging to fight for religious freedom protections and restrictions on abortion. The Justice Department is eager to move quickly in laying out its legal position on transgender policy, to avoid confusion in cases moving through the courts. The dispute has underscored the influence that Mr. Sessions, an early and ardent supporter of Mr. Trump, is likely to exercise over domestic policy. As someone who has a long record of opposing efforts to broaden federal protections on a range of matters under his purview \u2014 immigration, voting rights and gay rights, for example \u2014 he has moved quickly to set the Justice Department on a strikingly different course than his predecessors in the Obama administration.",

      "author": "Dana Goldstein",
      "content": " With all the attention paid to President Trump\u2019s lightning-rod secretary of education, Betsy DeVos, and her advocacy for private school vouchers, little public notice has been paid to the action on education in Congress \u2014 where lawmakers have broader power than Ms. DeVos to make changes to the nation\u2019s school system. Now, Congress has done exactly that, voting to repeal crucial regulations associated with the Every Student Succeeds Act, one of President Barack Obama\u2019s final legislative achievements. When Mr. Obama signed the act in December 2015, many Democrats and Republicans alike celebrated the supposed end of what they saw as an era of federal overreach into local schools. The measure, known as ESSA, took a more collaborative approach than its predecessor, No Child Left Behind. Many critics viewed No Child, passed under President George W. Bush, as well as Mr. Obama\u2019s first-term education policies, as punitive. The policies pushed for test scores to be used to remove underperforming teachers and to shut down struggling schools. They were also unpopular because they led to an explosion in the number of tests students took each year. Under the Every Student Succeeds Act, children still have to take standardized tests in math, reading and science, and schools still need to report on the progress of at-risk groups, like disabled students, nonwhite students and those learning English. But fewer consequences are now tied to low test scores and more emphasis is placed on holding schools accountable for providing access to advanced classes and for reducing student suspension rates. In addition, states are now able to come up with their own plans for how to intervene in failing schools. Mr. Obama called the bill a bipartisan \u201cChristmas miracle.\u201d The National Council of La Raza, a Latino-rights organization, gave ESSA\u2019s two Senate co-sponsors, Patty Murray of Washington, a Democrat, and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, a Republican, an award for their work on behalf of students learning English. The two appeared together to accept the honor, each praising the other\u2019s collaboration. It took less than a year for that bipartisan consensus to fall apart. It is customary for federal agencies to issue detailed regulations on how new laws should be put into effect, and Mr. Obama\u2019s Department of Education did so in November. But some lawmakers from both parties saw the regulations as unusually aggressive and far-reaching, and said they could subvert ESSA\u2019s intent of re-establishing local control over education and decreasing the emphasis on testing. Last month, the House of Representatives overturned a broad swath of the rules using the Congressional Review Act, which allows lawmakers to spike federal regulations. The Senate passed a similar resolution on Thursday, and President Trump has indicated that he will sign it. That would leave ESSA on the books, but Ms. DeVos would have more flexibility in how to apply it. The Obama regulations pushed states to weight student achievement measures, such as test scores and graduation rates, more heavily than other factors in labeling schools as underperforming. The regulations also required schools to provide parents and the public with a more detailed annual report card on schoolwide student achievement data and other indicators of success. Among the most contentious of the Obama rules was one that strengthened a provision in the law requiring schools to test at least 95 percent of their students. There were some good reasons for such a policy. To avoid the sanctions that come with low scores, schools have sometimes pressured or forced low-performing students to stay home on testing days. But conservatives said the 95 percent rule was excessive federal intervention, while some on the left said it prevented parents and students from \u201copting out\u201d of standardized tests \u2014 a popular protest tactic. \u201cThe regulations were an overreach,\u201d said Robert Schaeffer, the public education director of FairTest, a group that fights standardized testing. But, he said, \u201cthe total repeal is also an overreach,\u201d because it targets civil rights regulations as well as testing rules. Nine percent of American public school students are not native English speakers, and the regulations required states and schools to track the achievement of this group in more nuanced ways. Instead of looking at all English-language learners together, states were asked to break out the performance of the highest-risk groups, like recent immigrants or those who arrive in the United States behind grade level in their native language. Schools where such students struggle would have been subject to state intervention. The National Council of La Raza was part of a coalition of civil rights and business groups that supported the Obama regulations. Separating out different groups of English language learners \u201cis a plus for states,\u201d said Lor\u00e9n Trull, a senior policy adviser for La Raza. \u201cYou don\u2019t want it to look like you\u2019re serving all English language-learners poorly when some you are serving very well.\u201d Beginning in the 1980s, moderate Democrats and moderate Republicans tended to agree that the federal government ought to hold local schools to tough standards, and monitor them closely to make sure they were shrinking achievement gaps between different groups of students. The ESSA repeal effort shows that center no longer holds. On the Senate floor Wednesday, Mr. Alexander said a regulatory repeal would \u201crestore to states, to classroom teachers and to school boards decisions about what to do about the children.\u201d Democrats who favored the Obama rules sought to portray the repeal effort as an attempt to disrupt the normal regulatory process and give the Trump administration more power. \u201cI think we all know what\u2019s going on here,\u201d said Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. \u201cBetsy DeVos is the new secretary of education. Congressional Republicans have decided that they want to hand over the keys to her with no restrictions whatsoever.\u201d Ms. DeVos has said little about ESSA. But with the repeal, her department can now issue new guidance to states, most likely weakening the accountability measures that were a priority for the previous administration. The repeal throws a curveball at state policy makers, whose ESSA implementation plans are due at the Department of Education in mere weeks. \u201cThe states are planning and doing stuff,\u201d said Chris Minnich, executive director of the Council of Chief State School Officers, a bipartisan group that represents state education secretaries. \u201cThey want clarity on what they need to submit.\u201d Many states had already done the work needed to comply with the Obama administration\u2019s rules. They are unlikely to start the process over this year. \u201cThis is an inside-D.C. fight,\u201d Mr. Minnich said. \u201cBut this law will be successful or not depending on how states move forward.\u201d",

      "author": "Erica L. Green",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 For more than a decade, House Republicans led by the former Speaker John A. Boehner have used school children in the nation\u2019s capital as an experiment for school choice, funding a far-reaching voucher program to send poor children to private schools over the opposition of local teachers and unions. Now, with Betsy DeVos, one of the country\u2019s fiercest advocates of school choice, installed as education secretary, that experiment is poised to go national. But Ms. DeVos\u2019s own department this week rendered judgment on the Washington school choice program: It has not improved student achievement, and it may have worsened it. The examination of the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program, the only federally funded voucher program in the country, by the department\u2019s Institute of Education Sciences, found that students who attended a private school through the program performed worse on standardized tests than their public school counterparts who did not use the vouchers. Among students who attended poor-performing public schools \u2014 the targets of this and other voucher programs \u2014 there was no significant effect on achievement. Researchers and experts said the report offered a valuable, if limited, snapshot of the program that was based on a one-year study of 1,700 students \u2014 995 who were selected through a lottery to receive scholarship offers, and 776 who were not. The program was established in 2004 during Mr. Boehner\u2019s tenure as chairman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, and he proposed the legislation to reauthorize it in 2011 under the Scholarships for Opportunity and Results Act. Congress also mandated an independent evaluation of the program. The report, released Thursday, was well underway before the 2016 election, but it comes as President Trump and Ms. DeVos press Congress to devote hundreds of millions of dollars to a voucher program as part of a $1.4 billion plan to expand school choice among private, parochial and public charter schools \u2014 a move that critics say would cripple the public education system. Researchers said that the Washington program was not intended to make a case for or against a national voucher system. The city has a robust choice of charter and private schools, and public schools have significantly improved in the past decade \u2014 conditions not mirrored in other school districts. \u201cIn D.C., it\u2019s good to think of this as a study of value added to an environment that is already rich with school choice,\u201d said Marsha Silverberg, who oversaw the evaluation for the Institute of Education Sciences. Still, the results are sizable enough to conclude that students who were not selected for vouchers fared better academically. Math scores among students who used the vouchers were roughly seven percentage points lower than students who were not selected. The negative academic effect was even more pronounced for students who were not attending a low-performing school when they were awarded the vouchers \u2014 their scores were 14.6 percentage points lower in reading and 18.3 percentage points lower in math \u2014 and for students in elementary school. Switching schools had little effect on the achievement gap, the report found, but students in public schools did receive more instruction time each week in math and reading than students who used the private school vouchers. Private school proponents have often argued that comparing standardized test scores of public and private schools is unfair because public schools are held more accountable for test scores and tend to spend more time teaching tested subjects while private schools offer enrichment programs like art and music. Still, Mark Dynarski, the president of Pemberton Research and the lead author of the study, said it was hard to speculate why the achievement gaps exist. The report adds to mounting evidence that voucher programs across the country, which are often seen as an alternative to inferior public schools, are producing mixed academic results. Recent examinations of programs in Indiana, Louisiana, Ohio and Wisconsin have drawn similar conclusions. On a positive note, families who participated in the Washington program reported that their private schools were safer by a large margin. They also had slightly higher satisfaction rates with their private schools, though researchers deemed that gap statistically insignificant. Patrick J. Wolf, a University of Arkansas professor who served on the report\u2019s advisory committee, said the findings were more telling than the narrower lens of test scores. Mr. Wolf, who led the research team that conducted the scholarship program\u2019s first evaluation in 2010, said many studies showed that families were trading academic rigor for assurances that their children would be safe at school. \u201cIf you give a parent a choice between a child who is safe or doing better in math, they\u2019re going to choose safe every single time,\u201d Mr. Wolf said. \u201cIt\u2019s the hierarchy of human need.\u201d The new analysis fueled criticism from congressional Democrats who vehemently oppose public funding for private schools and have derided Ms. DeVos\u2019s affinity for the idea. Ms. DeVos, a billionaire, has advocated school choice expansion for decades in her home state, Michigan. As education secretary, she has praised a longstanding tax credit that funds vouchers in Florida and a recent expansion of vouchers in Arizona. Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, said that \u201cwhen Secretary DeVos\u2019s own department\u2019s independent research office tells her that siphoning taxpayer dollars into private schools has a negative impact on students, it\u2019s time for her to finally abandon her reckless plans to privatize public schools across the country.\u201d Ms. DeVos pledged to continue fully funding the Washington voucher program. Serving Our Children, the organization that manages the program, said it had provided individual scholarship awards of up to $12,679 for high school and $8,452 for elementary and middle school this school year. About 1,150 students use the program, attending 41 schools; 81 percent are black, and more than half receive some kind of public assistance. Ms. DeVos pointed out that the district\u2019s public school system had not suffered, but had improved, since the program began. But she did say that private schools needed to be held accountable for better outcomes for students, the same demand that she has made on public schools. \u201cThese schools need to improve upon how they serve some of D.C.\u2019s most vulnerable students,\u201d Ms. DeVos said in a statement. Representative Virginia Foxx of North Carolina, the chairwoman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, praised the scholarship program for its transparency and accountability but called the evaluation\u2019s results \u201cdisappointing.\u201d \u201cThose who operate and participate in this important program must step up and deliver the change that is necessary to ensure students excel from Day 1,\u201d she said.",

GreenPRINT EDITIONRegulation Addressing Racial Disparity in Special Education Is Delayed|December 16, 2017, Page A16",
      "author": "Erica L. Green",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 The Department of Education is proposing to delay for two years an Obama-era rule that requires states to aggressively address racial biases that may be channeling disproportionate numbers of minority children into special education. The department is soliciting public comment on its plan to postpone enforcement of the so-called \u201csignificant disproportionality rule,\u201d due to take effect July 1, 2018. The rule, which was issued in the last weeks of the Obama administration, required states to look at districts that had disproportionately high numbers of minority students identified for special education services, segregated in restrictive classroom settings or disciplined at higher rates than their peers. If it is not scrapped, the rule would take effect in 2020. The Education Department estimated in one analysis that nearly half of the school districts in the country would be identified as having significant disproportions of minorities in their special education populations if they were to adopt a standard the department considered reasonable. It also estimated that it would cost districts between $50 million and $91 million to implement the rule. It is one of several that Betsy DeVos, the secretary of education, is re-examining as her office continues a regulatory review ordered by President Trump across all federal agencies. \u201cThrough the regulatory review process, we\u2019ve heard from states, school districts, superintendents and other stakeholders on a wide range of issues, including the significant disproportionality rule,\u201d said Liz Hill, a spokeswoman for the Education Department. \u201cBecause of the concerns raised, the department is looking closely at this rule and has determined that while this review takes place, it is prudent to delay implementation for two years.\u201d The rule was designed to address concerns about the overrepresentation of minority students in special education. The Individuals With Disabilities Education Act required states to address \u201csignificant disproportionality,\u201d and in a 2004 reauthorization of the act, Congress began requiring states to allocate up to 15 percent of their federal special education money to address the disparities. Representative Bobby Scott of Virginia, the ranking Democrat on the House Committee on Education and Workforce, said that delaying the rules undermines Congress\u2019 2004 effort to strengthen the federal education law. \u201cClearly, leaving the disproportionality provision unregulated has left states and school districts without the tools necessary to implement the law\u2019s requirements,\u201d Mr. Scott said. \u201cAny effort to delay this rule, or remove it entirely, works against the fundamental goals of IDEA.\u201d The act did not define \u201csignificant disproportionality\u201d or set a threshold for how marked the racial disparities needed to be to raise red flags. A 2013 report issued by the Government Accountability Office found that only 3 percent of states ever used the law, and that some states had set such high thresholds for determining disproportionality that districts could never exceed them. The office recommended that the federal government set a standardized measure. In 2016, the Obama administration issued rules to strengthen compliance with the law by developing a standardized methodology \u2014 a complicated formula called a \u201crisk ratio\u201d \u2014 for all states to identify districts with high levels of disparities. The rule required districts to do a deep analysis of the root causes, but explicitly prohibited the use of quotas. Still, it was controversial. The delay comes amid new research that challenges the notion that racial bias is unfairly driving minority students into special education. Paul Morgan, a professor of education and demography at Pennsylvania State University, wrote a report in August that found that when comparing minority and white children who share similar characteristics, such as achievement levels and socioeconomic backgrounds, white students were more likely to receive special education services. Mr. Morgan said the results were similar to those in public health studies, in which minority children were less likely than their white peers to be identified and treated for illnesses. \u201cIt speaks to an issue of discrimination, but it\u2019s running contrary to what the general thinking has been,\u201d Mr. Morgan said. \u201cI completely agree that the issue of whether schools are being discriminatory is important, and the purpose of these regulations is to try to address that, but it does not take into account clinical need.\u201d Republican lawmakers, including Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, the chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, also protested the rule as federal overreach. Some educators argued that the more pressing issue was that too few minority students could access special education services. Some said the research on which the Obama administration based its decision was too limited to draw broad conclusions. But the Obama administration said that the disparities were wide enough to warrant action. For example, in 2012, the Education Department found that American Indian and Alaska Native students were 60 percent more likely to be labeled with an intellectual disability, while black children were more than twice as likely as other groups to be so identified. Similarly, American Indian or Alaska Native students were 90 percent more likely, black students were 50 percent more likely, and Hispanic students were 40 percent more likely to be identified as learning disabled. The rule took effect Jan. 18, and states would have begun calculating their disparities next school year. The Education Department announced in October that it had scrapped 600 outdated or obsolete guidances from its books, 72 of which were from the special education office. Special education advocates denounced the department\u2019s most recent move. \u201cWe know there is a problem that needs to be fixed \u2014 delaying implementation will only hurt children who are already in school and send a message to them that they are not important as other children are,\u201d the National Disability Rights Network\u2019s executive director, Curt Decker, said in a statement. But the move was lauded by school district leaders who said the rules would impose burdensome financial and administrative requirements on school districts that already struggle with flat federal funding and stringent mandates for special education students. The School Superintendents Association said in a statement that it supported the department\u2019s decision to delay what they described as \u201cheavy-handed and aggressive regulation.\u201d \u201cCongress, not the department, should address this complicated and important policy issue that impacts students with disabilities and the diversity of school districts that serve them,\u201d said Daniel A. Domenech, executive director of the association. \u201cWe stand ready to work with congress to develop a common sense policy solution.\u201d",

GreenPRINT EDITIONLoan Relief May Be Only Partial on Claims Against For-Profit Colleges|December 22, 2017, Page A17",
      "author": "Erica L. Green",
      "content": " Thousands of students who say they have been swindled by predatory for-profit universities will soon learn whether their loans will be forgiven by the Education Department, but under a new Trump administration policy, some students who expected full loan forgiveness may only receive partial relief. The education secretary, Betsy DeVos, announced Wednesday that the department will have responded to more than 20,000 so-called borrower-defense claims filed by students from Corinthian Colleges, a defunct for-profit chain that spurred a federal crackdown on for-profit colleges. The claims, part of nearly 100,000 that have amassed and stalled under the Trump administration, include 12,900 approvals and 8,600 denials. The notifications are the first step that Ms. DeVos has taken to address widespread abuses in the for-profit sector that have left students buried in debt with seemingly worthless degrees and little recourse except for seeking debt relief from the federal government. But the announcement that the department would begin discharging claims this week came with a caveat. The department\u2019s \u201cimproved process\u201d would allow some students to recoup only partial damages if they are found to be gainfully employed, Ms. DeVos said. \u201cWe have been working to get this right for students since day one,\u201d Ms. DeVos said in a statement. \u201cNo fraud is acceptable, and students deserve relief if the school they attended acted dishonestly. This improved process will allow claims to be adjudicated quickly and harmed students to be treated fairly. It also protects taxpayers from being forced to shoulder massive costs that may be unjustified.\u201d The move brought immediate backlash from congressional Democrats and consumer advocates who criticized Ms. DeVos for alleviating pressure on for-profits rather than looking out for the students. Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington and a vocal critic of Ms. DeVos\u2019s actions on for-profit regulations, called the model \u201ccruel.\u201d Ms. Murray, the top Democrat on the Senate education committee, said she planned to challenge the legality of the new system. \u201cThere is nothing fair about denying students the full relief they are entitled to when they are cheated, so it is appalling Secretary DeVos is creating a scheme to block full relief to tens of thousands of borrowers stuck paying back loans on worthless or nonexistent degrees,\u201d Ms. Murray said in a statement. It also brought worry and resignation to former students awaiting word on their applications for assistance. Jarrod Thoma, an Army veteran who filed a complaint in 2015 against DeVry University, was not hopeful. He said he was particularly disheartened when Ms. DeVos hired a former executive from DeVry, which paid out millions to settle claims that it misrepresented its outcomes, to lead the department\u2019s unit responsible for policing fraudulent and deceptive practices at colleges and universities. \u201cI feel like, because of the things that have been done around appointments and regulations, that I don\u2019t even stand a chance,\u201d Mr. Thoma said. \u201cThere\u2019s just no way anyone is going to be held accountable if everyone is buddy-buddy.\u201d Policy experts said that the decision unfairly penalized students who had managed to succeed despite being swindled. It was unfair, they added, to change the discharge process midstream, especially for Corinthian Colleges students whose applications were handled by two different administrations. \u201cIn other words, two students who attended the same program and were lied to in the same way by their school, and even who may have applied for a borrower-defense claim on the same day, could wind up with vastly different amounts of relief,\u201d wrote Clare McCann, a federal policy expert at the New America Foundation and a former Obama official. The new system, which Ms. DeVos said replaced an \u201call or nothing\u201d approach, would determine loan forgiveness on a tiered system. Students whose current earnings are less than 50 percent of their peers from a comparable program will receive full relief, and students whose earnings are at 50 percent or more of their peers will receive \u201cproportionally tiered relief to compensate for the difference and make them whole.\u201d The notifications culminate a year of uncertainty for student borrowers as the Trump administration has tried to chart a new course for regulating for-profit colleges. One of Ms. DeVos\u2019s first orders as secretary was pausing and rewriting Obama-era loan forgiveness regulations. She maintained that she wanted to correct a \u201cmuddled process that\u2019s unfair to students and schools, and puts taxpayers on the hook for significant costs.\u201d But Ms. DeVos has also expressed skepticism about the Obama-era process, saying in a September speech, \u201cUnder the previous rules, all one had to do was raise his or her hands to be entitled to so-called free money.\u201d The loan-forgiveness rules, which were to take effect in July, were seen as an aggressive response to widespread abuses that had been suspected for years, but a wide range of colleges, including historically black private colleges and universities, protested the rules for being too broad and punitive. A recent examination by the Century Foundation, which obtained information on the nearly 100,000 student borrower claims in November, found that 98 percent came from students who attended for-profit colleges. An Education Department panel began renegotiating the rules last month and will send recommendations to the department leadership in January. Ms. DeVos\u2019s announcement came more than a week after the Education Department\u2019s inspector general issued a report revealing the department had not approved a single claim since the Trump administration took office. More than 25,000 loan assistance claims had been filed since Mr. Trump assumed the presidency until July. The Obama administration approved nearly 30,000 such claims, estimated at $450 million, before the day that the Trump administration took office. The claims approved by the Obama administration granted full loan relief. Ms. DeVos requested the report by the inspector general over concerns that no standardized process was in place for adjudicating claims. Auditors found that the infrastructure established under the Obama administration was insufficient. The report portrayed an office that struggled to manage the claims with spreadsheets and contractors. It also found a lack of procedures and timelines for processing claims approved for loan discharge, including claim denials. But it also pointed out that Ms. DeVos halted progress that had been made under the Obama administration with the system that was in place, and the number of staff members to process claims had precipitously declined under Ms. DeVos. Many of the denial notifications this week are ones that were flagged but not issued by the Obama administration, the department said. The department will forgive interest on the loans of students that have been pending for more than one year Liz Hill, a spokeswoman for the department, maintained that the inspector general\u2019s report \u201cconfirms the previous administration did not establish an adequate adjudication process for borrower defense claims.\u201d \u201cThe desire to avoid denying claims or adjudicating complicated claims left thousands of students in limbo,\u201d Ms. Hill said. Students across the country with pending claims have been watching the Education Department closely for clues. The Obama administration began receiving and approving claims almost immediately after the collapse of Corinthian Colleges in 2015. A year later, after the collapse of ITT Technical Institute, the department announced that it would tighten rules on the loan-forgiveness statute that had been on the books since 1995 but had been used only five times. From June 2015 to January 2017, nearly 70,000 borrower claims flooded the department. It was one year and 60 job applications ago that Kip Malone tried to take his life back from ITT Technical Institute. Mr. Malone, a Navy veteran, graduated from the for-profit institution in 2011 with honors. He said he had hoped that his project management degree would land him jobs, but instead it landed him jokes. \u201cEmployers would literally laugh in my face,\u201d Mr. Malone said. Last year, after ITT Technical Institute shut down, Mr. Malone filed a claim with the Education Department, saying that the institution swindled him of nearly $50,000 of his grant through the G.I. Bill because he could not find gainful employment. But Mr. Malone said he and other students were not looking for free money. He was looking to redeem himself. \u201cI feel that since the school closed, the education I received doesn\u2019t really count,\u201d said Mr. Malone, who returned to school to pursue another degree after ITT Tech closed. \u201cI know once you graduate, they\u2019ve done their job, you\u2019re supposed to go about your business,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the fact that I had to go somewhere else to validate what I achieved was a very disheartening and frustrating experience that I really want to put behind me.\u201d",

      "content": " President Trump is famously spelling-challenged, but this one was not his fault. Mr. Trump is set to deliver his first State of the Union address on Tuesday, and the tickets issued to lawmakers\u2019 spouses and guests contained a glaring typo: \u201cState of the Uniom.\u201d The tickets, printed by the Office of the Sergeant at Arms and Doorkeeper, had to be reissued on Monday. \u201cIt was corrected immediately, and our office is redistributing the tickets,\u201d a spokesman for the sergeant at arms told Agence France-Presse. The office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday evening, and it was not clear how many tickets were affected. Lawmakers in both parties poked fun at the typo. But Democrats were more ruthless in their mockery. Representative Ra\u00fal M. Grijalva, Democrat of Arizona, took the opportunity to criticize Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, whose office has had its own spelling problems. In a tweet last February, the Education Department misspelled W. E. B. Du Bois\u2019s name \u2014 and two months later, the White House\u2019s official Snapchat channel referred to Ms. DeVos as the \u201cSecretary of Educatuon.\u201d The president had no involvement in the printing of the State of the Union tickets. But he has received his own share of language-related criticism over the past year, tweeting such non-words as \u201cunpresidented,\u201d \u201chonered,\u201d \u201chearby\u201d and, of course, \u201ccovfefe.\u201d The Office of the Sergeant at Arms could have benefited from caution after Hofstra University was ridiculed for a similar error in 2016. Commemorative tickets for the first presidential debate between Mr. Trump and Hillary Clinton misspelled Mrs. Clinton\u2019s given name with one L. The State of the Union tickets, though, had two typos for the price of one: In addition to \u201cUniom,\u201d they referred to the \u201cVisitor\u2019s Gallery.\u201d It is actually the Visitors\u2019 Gallery.",

GreenPRINT EDITIONOhio Town Finds Itself at a Crossroads as Two Education Leaders Converge|April 21, 2017, Page A17",
      "author": "Erica L. Green",
      "content": " VAN WERT, Ohio \u2014 Ken Amstutz\u2019s phone did not stop buzzing long enough for him to think about what could happen in 24 hours. He was fielding questions from public officials and the national news media, keeping tabs on planned protests and coordinating a meeting with United States Marshals. \u201cNothing like this happens in Van Wert!\u201d said Mr. Amstutz, a small-town school superintendent. Then on Thursday, Betsy DeVos, the education secretary, and Randi Weingarten, her antagonist and president of the American Federation of Teachers, descended on this small, rural school district for a highly anticipated meeting of two polarizing education leaders. In a town that voted overwhelmingly for President Trump, and that takes pride in its public school system, educators hoped the two leaders could find common ground. The area remains avowedly Republican but is leery of the budget cuts that Mr. Trump has proposed for federal aid to poor school districts. Parents also have little use for the Trump administration\u2019s push to expand school choice and access to private-school vouchers. They want their neighborhood schools to work, because that is what they have. \u201cWe\u2019ve always voted Republican,\u201d Mr. Amstutz said. \u201cPublic education is one area where Republicans have done nothing for us, really.\u201d Ms. Weingarten and Ms. DeVos made for strange traveling companions. Ms. Weingarten called Ms. DeVos\u2019s confirmation a \u201csad day for children\u201d and has accused the billionaire secretary of undermining public education by bankrolling school choice initiatives in Michigan. Ms. DeVos is a staunch supporter of parochial and charter schools and has challenged teachers\u2019 unions. While she says she supports public schools, she has been sharply critical of their performance and believes in expanding options for parents. The two leaders have also clashed over Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed budget, which would cut the Education Department by $9 billion, targeting programs for poor students, even as it funds a $1.4 billion school choice initiative. Ms. Weingarten challenged Ms. DeVos to visit a public school system, and the result was the visit to Van Wert, a small district with a robust early childhood program, a nationally recognized robotics team and a community school that helps at-risk students graduate. \u201cIt was clear that this community has invested heart and soul into the students here,\u201d Ms. DeVos said, praising the district. Ms. Weingarten said the visit \u201cproves that support for public schools transcends politics.\u201d For teachers and students here, fights over funding and policy are not abstract. Jen Arend, a literacy specialist at Van Wert\u2019s early childhood center, is paid with federal Title I money, which provides additional resources to districts with high concentrations of poverty. Mr. Trump\u2019s budget proposes increasing Title I funding but using it for school choice initiatives. \u201cI hope she sees we\u2019re more than a line item in the budget,\u201d Ms. Arend said of Ms. DeVos. At Van Wert High School, Spencer Teman, a senior, showcased his robotics team\u2019s 18-by-18-inch robot, Suzanne, which won the state robotics championship this year. \u201cIn our school, opportunities are everywhere, and they should stay here,\u201d said Mr. Teman, 18, who is set to attend Miami University of Ohio next year. Van Wert, which serves 2,000 students two hours northwest of Columbus, is an unlikely place for a national showdown on education policy, which is largely driven by big-city politics. But it illustrates how politics and public education do not always match up. About 80 percent of Van Wert\u2019s 13,584 votes in November went to Mr. Trump, and the town is considered among the most conservative in the state. But \u201ceducation is different,\u201d said Linda Haycock, a newly elected state school board member who represents Van Wert and 22 other small northwestern Ohio counties. \u201cBecause in rural districts, they have the most to lose.\u201d Mr. Amstutz said that in Van Wert\u2019s schools, \u201cwe struggle every day to make ends meet.\u201d The school district is more than 95 percent white, and half of its students qualify for free or reduced-priced meals \u2014 an increase of 10 percentage points from when Mr. Amstutz took over as superintendent 10 years ago. The school system\u2019s $22 million budget supports five schools: an elementary school, a middle school, a high school, an early childhood center and an alternative school. The district receives about $2 million in federal funding. Title I pays for teachers who work with struggling readers in kindergarten through third grade. And Van Wert uses the federal Title II program, which funds professional development and is targeted for elimination, to reduce class sizes. Spending federal money or any other taxpayer funds on vouchers for private school tuition is looked on harshly. Ms. Haycock called it \u201creally theft.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s saying we passed a levy to go to our school district, and it\u2019s really going somewhere else,\u201d she said. Educators hope Ms. DeVos saw during her visit that they make do with what they have. In the elementary school, 60 percent of students are below the poverty line, and the school had to hire many support staff members, including a social worker whose caseload swelled to 40 this year, to help students and families meet basic needs and manage hardships. \u201cOut here in the middle of cow country, we have this amazing opportunity to serve kids who are no different than kids anywhere else,\u201d said Kevin Gehres, the elementary school\u2019s principal. \u201cOur funding is the blood, sweat and tears of our community, and we are held accountable for that.\u201d In the middle school, principals have overhauled scheduling to give teachers control of nearly 300 minutes of a 400-minute day. The district has a 96 percent graduation rate, but Van Wert High School\u2019s principal, Bob Priest, said he knew of 86 unfilled jobs at the local farm and food processing company. Too many students leave school unable to fill the jobs because they cannot pass a drug test and show up to work on time, he said. So the school has an internship program that pairs students with local businesses. Van Wert educators said they believed their biggest threat was school choice. An expanded voucher program would be \u201cpotentially catastrophic\u201d for the district\u2019s finances, said Mike Ruen, the district\u2019s treasurer. About 400 students now take advantage of a state open-enrollment policy, which Ms. DeVos endorsed during her visit. It allows students to attend an out-of-district school and take $6,000 in state per-pupil funding with them. Most of them attend schools in a neighboring suburb. About 20 students are enrolled in an online charter school that has a 39 percent graduation rate. And a local vocational school takes 80 percent of the funding for each student who transfers there. Only one private school competes directly with Van Wert public schools: a small Catholic elementary school in town that the public school system provides special education services to, mostly at no charge. A Catholic high school 15 miles away is less of a draw, but could become one if parents receive vouchers. \u201cI don\u2019t think people are against choice,\u201d Mr. Amstutz said. \u201cBut when you talk about expansion, taking money away from public schools, it gives people heartburn.\u201d Ms. DeVos made no commitments to changing course on the federal budget and policies, but said she needed to digest the visit. Ms. Weingarten, who has been invited to tour a school of choice with Ms. DeVos, said her union would continue to fight vigorously against budget cuts and publicly funded vouchers. \u201cI think today was important, and I hope that she saw things that will make her reflect on the importance of public education to our country,\u201d Ms. Weingarten said of Ms. DeVos. \u201cTime will tell.\u201d",

      "author": "Erica L. Green",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump issued a sweeping review of federal education policies on Wednesday in an executive order to pinpoint areas where the government may be overstepping in shaping operations of local school systems. The order requires Betsy DeVos, Mr. Trump\u2019s education secretary, to review, modify and possibly repeal any regulations and guidelines that are not consistent with federal law. Mr. Trump described the order as \u201canother critical step to restoring local control,\u201d and one that fulfills one of his campaign promises. \u201cFor too long, the federal government has imposed its will on state and local governments,\u201d Mr. Trump said at a news conference to sign the order. \u201cThe result has been education that spends more, and achieves far, far, far less.\u201d The review will be conducted within 300 days, and its findings will be published in a public report. It aims to ensure local leaders will have the final say \u201cabout what happens in the classroom,\u201d said Rob Goad, a senior Education Department official. Ms. DeVos is already empowered to rescind guidance and regulations, and has already done so, and any attempt at overturning laws would be subjected to a legal, regulatory process. In an interview, Ms. DeVos called Mr. Trump\u2019s order a \u201cwelcomed opportunity\u201d and \u201ca clear mandate to take that real hard look at what we\u2019ve been doing at the department level that we shouldn\u2019t be doing, and what ways we have overreached.\u201d She said Mr. Trump had already espoused \u201cthe importance of states and localities\u2019 being able to address issues that are closest to them.\u201d \u201cAnd when it comes to education, decisions made at local levels and at state levels are the best ones,\u201d Ms. DeVos said. The review will focus on K-12 policy, Mr. Goad said. It will be overseen by a regulatory task force headed by Robert Eitel, who was hired from the for-profit sector to serve as a senior counselor to Ms. DeVos. Mr. Eitel is a vocal critic of regulations in higher-education and K-12 policy, and his hiring was controversial. A New York Times investigation found that before he took his post in the Education Department, Mr. Eitel spent 18 months as a top lawyer for a company facing multiple government investigations, including one that ended with a settlement of more than $30 million over deceptive student lending. Mr. Trump\u2019s order was lauded by the Center for Education Reform, which advocates school-choice policies. In a statement, its founder, Jeanne Allen, said that conducting the review was \u201cpart and parcel of ensuring that education innovation, and opportunity, are able to take root throughout our various education sectors.\u201d \u201cThe process will also allow the public to learn just how much oversight occurs as a result of bureaucracy, not law, and pave the way for all schools to focus on outcomes, not compliance,\u201d Ms. Allen said. But other observers said the order stands to have little impact on large-scale reforms already underway, such as the Every Student Succeeds Act, and bedrock laws like the Individuals with Disabilities Act, which governs the education of special education students. And the Common Core standards, which neither Ms. DeVos nor Mr. Trump supports, were adopted by states at their own volition. \u201cThe bottom line is that the law is still the law, and an executive order can\u2019t override that,\u201d said Kelly McManus, interim director of legislative affairs at the Education Trust, a Washington think tank. Ms. McManus said the organization is also concerned about the Education Department\u2019s watchdog role being diminished. \u201cThe good states need the cover of the federal government, and the bad actors need to be pushed by the federal government,\u201d she said. Where the order could have the most impact is in the area of civil rights, in which the Obama administration issued a series of guidance documents. One of the Trump administration\u2019s first acts was rescinding earlier Education Department guidelines that urged states to allow transgender students to use bathrooms corresponding with their gender identity. Wade Henderson, president and chief executive of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, called Mr. Trump\u2019s order \u201cdangerous and wrongheaded.\u201d \u201cState and local primacy without federal oversight in America\u2019s schools has never worked for all children and will not work now,\u201d Mr. Henderson said in a scathing statement.",

      "author": "Michael Tackett",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump said on Thursday that the federal government would continue to fund the Special Olympics, reversing his administration\u2019s decision to cut the allocated money, which his education secretary, Betsy DeVos, had been defending on Capitol Hill only hours earlier. \u201cThe Special Olympics will be funded. I just told my people,\u201d Mr. Trump said to reporters before leaving for a campaign-style rally in Michigan. The president said he had long supported the organization. His statement was an abrupt pivot from the stance offered by others in his administration. Ms. DeVos defended the trims in a Senate budget hearing not long before the president undercut her position. The Special Olympics is one of thousands of line-item programs that were proposed to be cut or zeroed out in the president\u2019s fiscal 2020 budget \u2014 and that Congress had no intention of cutting. Most presidential budgets are routinely declared dead on arrival by members of Congress, the branch of government that appropriates money. But Mr. Trump\u2019s budgets have been ignored more than most. The Special Olympics proposal did not appear serious from the start. The day before it was released, the White House announced that Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s wife, Karen Pence, would lead the American delegation to the games. That did not stop the friction between Ms. DeVos, congressional Democrats and several Republicans. Ms. DeVos had said that the program, which received an appropriation of about $17.5 million, did good work but that in a time of difficult budget decisions, hard choices had to be made. Matt Wolking, deputy communications director of Mr. Trump\u2019s re-election campaign, said Thursday on Twitter that \u201cthe Special Olympics, by the way, is a private charity with $61.3 million in net assets that gets only 10% of its funding from taxpayers and enjoyed a $1.8 million surplus in FY2016.\u201d He also said, \u201cI\u2019m sure that Democrats who see abortion as the cure for Down syndrome and other disabilities are sincerely concerned about kids having a chance to be in the Special Olympics.\u201d That sentiment prevailed for about four hours until Mr. Trump quickly reversed course. \u201cI want to fund the Special Olympics, and I just authorized a funding of the Special Olympics,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI\u2019ve been to the Special Olympics. I think it\u2019s incredible, and I just authorized a funding. I heard about it this morning. I have overridden my people. We\u2019re funding the Special Olympics.\u201d Ms. DeVos also noted that she had long been a supporter of the Special Olympics. A billionaire, she received approval to give away her $199,700 government salary last year, and part of it went to the organization. \u201cI love its work,\u201d she said in a statement, \u201cand I have personally supported its mission.\u201d",

      "author": "Erica L. Green",
      "content": " BALTIMORE \u2014 Three national civil rights organizations sued the Education Department on Thursday over new procedures that allow its Office for Civil Rights to dismiss complaints that it determines to be burdensome or a drain on the department\u2019s resources. The National Federation of the Blind, the Council of Parent Attorneys and Advocates, and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People said that the department was \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d in making substantive revisions to its case-processing manual, which guides its handling of civil rights complaints, without giving the public notice, an explanation or a chance to comment. The organizations, which all have headquarters in Baltimore, also charged that the changes were unlawful and undermined the agency\u2019s statutory obligation to investigate any complaint when there was reason to believe a civil rights violation had occurred. The suit, filed in United States District Court in Maryland, accused Education Secretary Betsy DeVos of violating the federal Administrative Procedure Act, and the acting assistant secretary for civil rights, Candice Jackson, of breaking the law by enacting the new manual. The groups asked a judge to stop the department from enforcing the new provisions. \u201cThis is one way, sometimes the only way, for vulnerable people who can\u2019t afford to litigate, to get their cases heard, and that\u2019s being taken away,\u201d said Eve Hill of Baltimore-based Brown Goldstein & Levy, the lead lawyer for the plaintiffs. In March, the department changed the manual to allow the Office for Civil Rights to dismiss complaints if they represent \u201ca pattern of complaints previously filed with O.C.R. by an individual or a group against multiple recipients,\u201d or complaints \u201cfiled for the first time against multiple recipients\u201d that place \u201can unreasonable burden on O.C.R.\u2019s resources.\u201d The department also eliminated appeals because it said they rarely resulted in a different outcome. Education Department officials said the revisions targeted \u201cfrequent fliers,\u201d a handful of individuals who had generated thousands of complaints that were straining the department\u2019s resources. Officials said the changes were partly a result of feedback from career investigators who were not able to respond to other complaints because they had amassed such a backlog. They said that in some cases, issues prompting mass filings warranted \u201ctechnical assistance\u201d rather than exhaustive investigations. The changes, according to Liz Hill, a department spokeswoman, reflected the office\u2019s \u201ccommitment to robustly investigating and correcting civil rights issues\u201d and \u201cimproving O.C.R.\u2019s management of its docket, investigations and case resolutions.\u201d Ms. Hill declined to comment on the lawsuit, citing pending litigation. The department said the revisions would not apply to broad complaints filed by groups, but the lawsuit said the provisions, as written, gave no such assurances. The manual does not define what constitutes a \u201cpattern,\u201d and the organizations argue that the provisions, as written, are not limited to those complaints that would place an \u201cunreasonable burden\u201d on the civil rights office. Unlike the previous manual, the current one leaves no room for discretion, stating that such cases will be dismissed. The changes have already resulted in the dismissal of more than 500 cases filed by a Michigan-based disability rights advocate, Marcie Lipsitt, who had opened more than 2,400 web-accessibility complaints against various educational institutions in the last two years. Her complaints resulted in more than 1,000 resolution agreements with institutions such as colleges and universities, which vowed to make their websites accessible to people who are deaf or blind or who struggle with fine motor skills. The department has started revising some of those agreements in light of the new case-processing manual, Ms. Lipsitt said. Last week, House and Senate Democrats wrote to Ms. DeVos denouncing the manual\u2019s changes. They noted that \u201cfrequent fliers\u201d are usually advocacy groups or individual advocates who have either expertise or resources that allow them to identify systematic violations. \u201cSelectively choosing which students will be protected and which complaints will be investigated is a violation of the law and will result in serious civil rights violations going unchallenged,\u201d said the letter, organized by Senator Bob Casey of Pennsylvania. For the last decade, the National Federation of the Blind has helped its members navigate technology in schools and on college campuses, said Mark Riccobono, the organization\u2019s president. But progress has been slow, particularly in higher education, where the organization has seen members drop out of school because they could not gain access to the registration system or classes that were available only online. \u201cThis is going to have an effect on the class of blind people who really need the Department of Education\u2019s Office for Civil Rights to continue to enforce the avenues of access that really aren\u2019t being met,\u201d he said. In 2009, the organization filed several complaints with the civil rights office and the Justice Department against colleges and universities that were deploying inaccessible Amazon Kindle devices in classes. The complaints resulted in resolution agreements with several colleges and universities. The Council of Parent Attorneys and Advocates represents lawyers, advocates and parents who file complaints frequently and repeatedly on a range of issues related to special education services. Denise Marshall, the organization\u2019s executive director, said that the department\u2019s effort to curb mass filings was like \u201cusing a sledgehammer to open a nut.\u201d \u201cWhether a person is aware of one violation, or ends up needing to file hundreds of complaints, should not matter,\u201d Ms. Marshall said. \u201cThe question is are the complaints valid.\u201d Brad Berry, general counsel for the N.A.A.C.P., said he was concerned that the new case-processing manual was part of a larger goal of the Trump administration to curb civil rights enforcement. The new manual could close the organization\u2019s last avenue to pursue relief when policies disproportionately affect students of color because that kind of discrimination can be combated only by the federal government. The N.A.A.C.P. is one of several groups that have filed complaints on behalf of students and against schools over disciplinary and special education policies that may unduly affect black children. Mr. Berry said the lawsuit represented one of the most important moments in the organization\u2019s history since Brown v. Board of Education. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen what it looks like when civil rights are under attack,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we see it, we fight it.\u201d",

Will she bring that free-market approach to America\u2019s public schools?By Kate ZernikePRINT EDITIONHow Trump\u2019s Choice for Education Shaped Schools in Detroit|December 13, 2016, Page A12",
      "author": "Kate Zernike",
      "content": " Few disagreed that schools in Detroit were a mess: a chaotic mix of charters and traditional public schools, the worst-performing in the nation. So city leaders across the political spectrum agreed on a fix, with legislation to provide oversight and set standards on how to open schools and close bad ones. But the bill died without even getting a final vote. And the person most influential in killing it is now President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s nominee to oversee the nation\u2019s public schools, Betsy DeVos. Her resistance to the legislation last spring is a window into Ms. DeVos\u2019s philosophy and what she might bring to the fierce and often partisan debate about public education across the country, and in particular, the roles of choice and charter schools. The bill\u2019s proposals are common in many states and accepted by many supporters of school choice, like a provision to stop failing charter operators from creating new schools. But Ms. DeVos argued that this kind of oversight would create too much bureaucracy and limit choice. A believer in a freer market than even some free market economists would endorse, Ms. DeVos pushed back on any regulation as too much regulation. Charter schools should be allowed to operate as they wish; parents would judge with their feet. Detroit Public Schools, she argued, should simply be shut down and the system turned over to charters, or the tax dollars given to parents in the form of vouchers to attend private schools. \u201cShe is committed to an ideological stance that is solely about the free market, at the expense of practicality and the basic needs of students in the most destabilized environment in the country,\u201d said Tonya Allen, the president of the Skillman Foundation, a nonprofit that works with Detroit children, and a co-chairwoman of the coalition that produced the report that became the basis for the legislation last spring. \u201cIf she was showing herself present in places and learning from the practitioners, that\u2019s a fine combination,\u201d Ms. Allen said. \u201cBut Betsy never showed up in Detroit. She was very eager to impose experimentation on students that she has not spent time with and children that she does not have consequence for.\u201d Ms. DeVos has a long career as an education philanthropist and lobbyist, but not as an educator. She and her husband, Dick, an heir to the Amway fortune, are considered the most powerful Republicans in Michigan. In the debate over Detroit schools, Republican lawmakers say, Ms. DeVos withheld her financial support until they agreed to kill the bill. And they were rewarded well when they did: Ms. DeVos\u2019s family began a flood of donations to Republicans that totaled $1.45 million in seven weeks. Ms. DeVos declined to be interviewed. But her allies say her views have been misinterpreted. \u201cShe\u2019s never said choice and choice alone is the panacea for public education,\u201d said Gary Naeyaert, the lobbyist who leads the Great Lakes Education Project, which Ms. DeVos founded to advance charter schools in Michigan in 2001 after her family had spent nearly $5.8 million on a losing initiative to establish statewide school vouchers. \u201cIt\u2019s choice, quality and accountability.\u201d Hers was a different version of choice, quality and accountability, however, than that envisioned by those who drafted and supported the legislation: a broad coalition of charter school and teachers\u2019 union leaders, the Detroit chamber of commerce and some of the city\u2019s most prominent Republican philanthropists and politicians, its Democratic mayor and the state\u2019s Republican governor. \u201cThe misinformation campaign was horrendous,\u201d said Thomas Stallworth III, a former state legislator who lobbied on behalf of the coalition. And the sway of her contributions was too much to overcome. \u201cThere\u2019s no way we could compete with that. We don\u2019t have those kinds of resources.\u201d Ms. DeVos and her husband had lobbied hard for the state law that established charter schools in 1994. It allowed an unusually large number of organizations to start charter schools, which are publicly funded but privately run. But it created little oversight. Even charter school supporters now criticize Detroit as one of the most unregulated markets in the country. About 80 percent of the state\u2019s charters are operated for profit, far higher than anywhere else. In 2011, the DeVoses and the Great Lakes project lobbied successfully to lift a cap on the number of charter schools, fighting off a provision that would have kept failing schools from expanding. In Detroit, which now has a greater proportion of charters than any city but New Orleans, one result was a glut of schools as more charters opened but the city\u2019s population continued to decline. Yet while there are too many seats in schools downtown, there are not enough in the poorest, most remote neighborhoods, where most students live. Traditional and charter schools alike compete with televisions, laptops and bicycles for students \u2014 and the taxpayer dollars that follow them. More than 150 schools have opened or closed in the last seven years, and it is not unusual to find students who change schools every year, and teachers who do so more often than that. With more than a dozen organizations issuing charters, it is hard for parents to get the information they need to inform their choices. And, in a city of 140 square miles, the highest-performing schools usually remain out of reach to the poorest students, because most schools do not offer transportation, and the city bus service is unreliable. Most charters have failed to improve on the dismal performance of the traditional public schools. High-performing national charter networks have stayed away because of the instability of the market. The Walton Family Foundation, which has committed $1 billion over the next five years to expanding charters and choice, similarly withdrew its money from Detroit earlier this year. The legislation proposed earlier this year by Goeff Hansen, a Republican state senator, would have paid off the debt of the city\u2019s traditional public schools, which were on the brink of bankruptcy, and returned control of those schools from the state to a locally elected school board. But the provision that proved most controversial to the DeVoses would have established a Detroit Education Commission, appointed by the mayor. With three members from charter schools, three from the traditional public schools and one an expert in educational accountability, the commission was to come up with an A-to-F grading system for all schools, and evaluate which neighborhoods in the city most needed schools. School operators that earned below an A or B could not expand without the commission\u2019s signing off on their location. Schools that earned an F three years in a row could be closed. Ms. DeVos and her husband wrote legislators urging them to reject any legislation that included the commission. Why, they argued, should residents have choice in where they shop for food and travel, but not in schools? She wrote a Detroit News op-ed  arguing to \u201cretire\u201d Detroit Public Schools and \u201cliberate all students\u201d to use tax dollars to attend public or charter schools of their choice. Leaders of 20 charter schools in Detroit, including some of the highest-performing, made a last-ditch effort to urge the Legislature to adopt the commission. \u201cWe have to be looking at every possible way to expand the choices and the opportunities in the neighborhoods for families,\u201d Clark Durant, a onetime Republican candidate for the United States Senate and the co-founder of a network of schools, said at a news conference alongside Mayor Mike Duggan. \u201cAnd I believe this is the beginning of that effort.\u201d The legislation passed the State Senate. But in the House of Representatives, support fell away, as leaders of the Republican caucus reminded the members of how much financial support the DeVoses could withhold. They warned that the DeVoses would finance primary challenges against Republicans who defied her, as they had done to one who voted against the bill to lift the cap on charter schools five years earlier. The DeVoses, said Representative Dave Pagel, a Republican who supported the commission, \u201cmade arguments that were strongly heard, and they prevailed.\u201d Another Republican, declining to comment for fear of alienating Ms. DeVos when she is poised to become a cabinet secretary, sent a link to an article detailing the DeVoses\u2019 financial contributions to Republicans after the vote, saying it explained all there was to explain. The House passed a bill that never included the language establishing the commission. The bill paid off the debt of Detroit Public Schools and returned the city\u2019s traditional public schools to local control. And it will allow the state to close the schools at the bottom of existing state rankings, which Mr. Naeyaert said was proof that Ms. DeVos supported measures to ensure quality. But that will mean shutting down mostly traditional public schools, which in Detroit serve the neediest students, and further desert students in neighborhoods where charters have largely declined to go. \u201cMy complaint around this is not that you disagree,\u201d said Ms. Allen, at the Skillman Foundation, \u201cbut that you never could come up with another solution to deal with the practical issues of poor public policy that is not only eroding a traditional school system, but eroding all schools.\u201d",

      "author": "Emmarie Huetteman",
      "content": "   \u25a0 With two Republican senators now opposed, Betsy DeVos\u2019s nomination to be education secretary is in trouble. \u25a0 President Trump made an unscheduled trip to Dover Air Force Base to greet the remains of a fallen commando. \u25a0 Why did President Trump already file to run for re-election? To make sure the money still flowing into his campaign does not have to be refunded. Two Republican senators on Wednesday said they would vote against Ms. DeVos, the nominee to head the Education Department, raising the real prospect that Ms. DeVos could fail to garner the votes necessary to be confirmed. Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said on the floor of the Senate that they would vote against Ms. DeVos. \u201cI will not, I cannot vote to confirm her as our nation\u2019s next secretary of education,\u201d Ms. Collins said. Both senators, who voted to advance her selection out of committee, said they had serious reservations about her lack of familiarity with public schools. \u201cI think that Mrs. DeVos has much to learn about our nation\u2019s public schools,\u201d Ms. Murkowski said. Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, has said he believes every Democrat will vote against Ms. DeVos. If that is the case, the defections by Ms. Collins and Ms. Murkowski would bring the number of votes against her to 50, setting up a tie in the Senate that Vice President Mike Pence, in his capacity as president of the Senate, might need to come in to settle. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said he had no worries. \u201cI am 100 percent confident she will be the next secretary of education,\u201d he said. President Trump flew to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware on Wednesday to honor the remains of a Navy commando killed in a raid on Al Qaeda forces in Yemen on Sunday, the first combat casualty of his presidency. Mr. Trump left the White House by helicopter shortly after 3 p.m., accompanied by his daughter Ivanka. The White House did not announce his destination until shortly before he arrived, an unusual break with protocol, though former President Barack Obama paid multiple, unannounced visits to the Dover Air Base to receive the caskets of fallen soldiers. At the air base, Mr. Trump attend a private ceremony with the family of the commando, Chief Petty Officer William \u201cRyan\u201d Owens, who was a member of Navy Seal Team 6. The raid was the first military operation ordered by Mr. Trump, and the press secretary, Sean Spicer, spoke emotionally about the sacrifice made by Chief Petty Officer Owens. With the exception of visits to war zones like Afghanistan and Iraq, presidents rarely, if ever, travel without notifying the news media in advance. Mr. Trump, a senior White House official said, did not announce the trip out of respect for the privacy of the Owens family and because he did not want to turn it into a media spectacle. When Mr. Obama traveled to Dover without notifying the media in 2011, it prompted a surge of questions from the White House press corps. The White House said it had made the decision based on security concerns. On the day of his inauguration, President Trump filed paperwork to declare his candidacy in the 2020 election, but it wasn\u2019t necessarily a show of supreme confidence \u2014 more like a grasp for cash. Financial disclosures filed with the Federal Election Commission show that a lucrative December made the move an accounting necessity. The Trump campaign ended the year with $7.6 million in the bank and no debt, so any funds raised over $5,000 by the campaign in 2017 would have to be returned unless Mr. Trump registered as a candidate for 2020. He obviously was not prepared to offer refunds. And the money has kept flowing. The campaign brought in more than $4 million in expense refunds, mostly from members of the media and the Secret Service for the seats they used on his campaign planes. This arrangement is typical \u2014 campaigns are required to charge the Secret Service and the press a fair rate. What\u2019s unusual is that most of the campaign\u2019s air travel expenses, nearly $9 million, were paid to companies owned by Trump. There is one expenditure that has not slowed: Making America wear red hats again. The Trump campaign, along with two fundraising committees that raise money jointly with the Republican Party, brought in $6.5 million in contributions in the last month of 2016. More than a third of that was spent on on hats, mugs, stickers and other collateral. Anthony Scaramucci, an investment firm founder and Republican donor, won\u2019t be assuming the role of director of the White House office of public liaison, as previously announced, a senior administration official said. Mr. Scaramucci on Wednesday was told by Reince Priebus, the chief of staff to President Trump, and by the chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, that someone else would have to be given the job. However, the official said, the two men plan to find another role for Mr. Scaramucci in the West Wing down the road. At issue is Mr. Scaramucci\u2019s sale of his firm, SkyBridge Capital, to a division of HNA Group, a politically connected Chinese conglomerate that will become the investment firm\u2019s majority owner. The sale has not been completed, and West Wing officials said that the White House Counsel\u2019s Office predicted it would take up to 90 days for Mr. Scaramucci to be cleared of potential ethics conflicts. The White House is currently operating without a functioning Office of Public Liaison and Intergovernmental Affairs, the formal name for the office which Mr. Scaramucci would have led, at a moment when protests are sweeping the country over the president\u2019s ban on travel for immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries. Mr. Scaramucci could get an ambassadorship, but that would require Senate confirmation, which is another lengthy process. Mr. Scaramucci had been expected to be sworn in on Jan. 22 with other White House personnel, but it was delayed amid questions related to the business transaction. This is not the first time that a West Wing aide has been announced for a role that they ultimately didn\u2019t fill. Mr. Trump has no communications director and lost a National Security Council senior staff member after questions about whether she\u2019d plagiarized portions of her book. Yes, that Frederick Douglass, former slave, abolitionist and statesman who died in 1895. Meeting with African-American supporters at the White House on Wednesday, the president let it be known that Mr. Douglass, an important figure in American history, had come to his attention. \u201cFrederick Douglass is an example of somebody who has done an amazing job and is being recognized more and more, I notice,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cHarriet Tubman, Rosa Parks and millions more black Americans who made America what it is today. A big impact.\u201d Yes, he said that. Mr. Trump\u2019s hope for relative peace and calm this weekend at Mar-a-Lago, his private club in Palm Beach, Fla., may be disrupted. Emboldened by demonstrations across the country, and the White House\u2019s decision to skip a trip to Milwaukee rather than face angry opponents, protesters are planning a march outside the club as it plays host to the annual American Red Cross gala. The gala has been held at the club in previous years, and Mr. Trump has attended. It is unclear whether he will attend this year. The protests will paint an untimely tableau for a president whose last five days have been spent facing fallout from his executive order temporarily banning travel from seven Muslim-majority nations. Their action may have been encouraged by the White House itself. The decision to cancel President Trump\u2019s trip to Milwaukee for a visit to a Harley-Davidson factory on Thursday was sure to have repercussions for the already energized activists opposing Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency. Harley-Davidson was worried about the protests and the possible harm to its popularity, just as Peyton Manning was last week when he dashed out the back door of a Republican retreat in Philadelphia rather than risk the cameras. And the next big march on Washington \u2014 this one dubbed the March for Science \u2014 now has a date: April 22, Earth Day. The Democratic National Committee is already mocking the decision. \u201cDonald Trump is a real tough guy when it comes to locking up a scared 5-year-old boy trying to find his mother,\u201d said Zac Petkanas, Democratic National Committee senior adviser. \u201cBut as soon as he has to face the American people to defend his illegal anti-Muslim ban, he chickens out. What a profile in courage.\u201d First, President Trump called his hard stop on refugees and visas to seven Muslim nations a ban. Then his press secretary, Sean Spicer, stood at the White House podium on Tuesday and said it was not a ban, a position he held to, even after reporters quoted his boss. Now Mr. Trump has asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s in a name?\u201d Glad that\u2019s settled. Plans for President Trump\u2019s state visit to Britain are all coming a cropper. When British Prime Minister Theresa May invited Mr. Trump last week to pay a state visit to Britain, a call on Queen Elizabeth II was part of the invitation. But royal visits tend to involve more than just the queen, and the Prince of Wales has made clear that he intends to give Mr. Trump a piece of his mind about the urgent need to address climate change. American officials have made clear that Mr. Trump has no intention of being lectured by Prince Charles and instead, he wants to be greeted by Prince Charles\u2019s much cuter children, including Prince William, his attractive wife, Kate Middleton, and their young children. Of course, this 2012 post on Twitter might make that a tad awkward as well: But Prince Charles, who has been denied a kingship most of his life because of his mother\u2019s decision to hang onto the crown into her 90s, has made clear that he does not intend to be passed over by Mr. Trump. The royal snag is one of several that have cropped up over Mr. Trump\u2019s visit. British Prime Minister Theresa May thought her own visit to the White House had gone swimmingly, only to discover that shortly after she left, Mr. Trump had signed an executive order barring refugees and the entry of anyone from seven countries, which caused a firestorm in Britain. Ms. May was accused of appeasement by a former British diplomat. Protesters gathered outside 10 Downing Street on Monday night, and more than 1.5 million signatures collected on an internet petition demanding that Mrs. May rescind her invitation for Mr. Trump to visit Queen Elizabeth II. Mrs. May has insisted that her invitation remain in force, but the initial bloom of her visit has decidedly faded. And now Prince Charles has promised to give it a royal tarnish. The Obama administration\u2019s efforts to regulate the once flourishing for-profit university system did not get a lot of attention, but they had big consequences. Critics of the universities saw fake diploma mills that recruited students with advertising on buses, on subways and even in homeless shelters, and then helped them get guaranteed student loans from the federal government. Money in hand, the for-profits often left the students to their own devices. If they dropped out, or got degrees that proved worthless in the work world, so be it: The taxpayer would pay off the loans if the students couldn\u2019t. The Obama-era regulations tightened up recruiting rules and tied loans to the schools\u2019 records of getting their students the jobs they were promised. Many for-profit universities went under. Now, President Trump \u2014 who just settled a fraud suit against his Trump University \u2014 has asked Liberty University\u2019s president, Jerry Falwell Jr., a stern critic of accreditation rules, to head a White House task force on higher education, assigned to focus on \u201coverregulation and micromanagement,\u201d a Liberty spokesman told NBC News. \u201cThe goal is to pare it back and give colleges and their accrediting agencies more leeway in governing their affairs,\u201d Mr. Falwell, an evangelical Christian, told The Chronicle of Higher Education. The pendulum could be swinging back fast. Whether former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. will actually run for president in 2020 at age 78 is still uncertain, but some of his plans for life after 44 years of public service became a bit more clear on Tuesday after he announced the formation of the Biden Foundation. And not surprisingly, Mr. Biden used one of his father\u2019s favorite aphorisms to mark the occasion. \u201cMy dad used to have an expression, \u2018It\u2019s a lucky person who gets up in the morning, puts both feet on the floor, knows what they\u2019re about to do and thinks it still matters,\u2019\u201d Mr. Biden said in a statement. \u201cWe look forward to this new chapter.\u201d Mr. Biden and his wife, Dr. Jill Biden, intend to use the foundation to advance some of their dearest foreign and domestic policy priorities, including their cancer initiative, combating violence against women, and supporting U.S. military service members and their families, according to the announcement. Several of the Bidens\u2019 closest friends and family members will serve on the board of the charity, including former Senator Ted Kaufman and Valerie Biden Owens, Mr. Biden\u2019s sister.",

      "author": "Glenn Thrush",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 After the education secretary, Betsy DeVos, started scaling back consumer protections for student borrowers last year, six states and the District of Columbia sped up their own efforts to crack down on abusive lending practices by companies that administer federal loan programs. Now Ms. DeVos is trying to stop them. Trump administration lawyers filed a \u201cstatement of interest\u201d last month supporting a lawsuit from the Student Loan Servicing Alliance, an industry trade group, against the District of Columbia for creating a student loan ombudsman office. Under a new city law, the companies would be required to apply for licenses and could lose their right to operate if officials determine that they have engaged in fraudulent or irresponsible practices. Administration lawyers accused the District of Columbia of trying \u201cto second-guess\u201d department officials in the selection of loan servicers, violating the supremacy clause in the Constitution in a case that could determine the future role of states in consumer protection. \u201cFederal loans are federal assets and therefore must be controlled and regulated by the federal government,\u201d said Elizabeth Hill, a spokeswoman for Ms. DeVos. She described the actions of the states as an illegal veto of federal authority. \u201cA piecemeal, state-by-state approach to regulating federal assets causes confusion for borrowers and makes administration of the loan program more complicated and costly,\u201d she added. Soon after the move, after months of battling the administration\u2019s deregulation agenda, the federal government\u2019s top student consumer protection officer, Seth Frotman, resigned from his job at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. In his resignation letter, Mr. Frotman called out his boss, Mick Mulvaney, the bureau\u2019s interim director, for turning his back \u201con young people and their financial futures\u201d by weakening enforcement. But he was equally troubled by what the Education Department had done. Over the past several years, even before Donald J. Trump was elected president, Mr. Frotman barnstormed the country to encourage state officials to scrutinize the companies that are contracted by the department to manage the loan portfolio, collect debt from students and work out payment plans with delinquent borrowers. And he raised concerns that the Education Department was withholding critical information on borrowers that is needed to bring enforcement actions against servicers, citing federal privacy laws. \u201cIt was important for me to speak out,\u201d Mr. Frotman wrote in an email. \u201cAs state law enforcement officials and legislators across the political spectrum stand up for student loan borrowers who have been ripped off at every turn, Donald Trump and Betsy Devos have instead chosen to protect companies engaged in rampant illegal practices,\u201d he added. \u201cAt stake is the financial future of millions of Americans and a trillion dollar black hole in our financial markets.\u201d Under Ms. DeVos, the department has loosened regulations on for-profit colleges that account for many student defaults and fraud allegations and killed a plan to introduce sweeping protections for borrowers released at the end of the Obama administration. In July, she proposed an overhaul of the department\u2019s student loan oversight division that would cut an Obama-era debt relief program by $13 billion for students who claim to be cheated by disreputable schools. Citing the traditional role of states in protecting consumer rights, officials in Connecticut, Illinois, California, Washington, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and the District of Columbia have responded by imposing new licensing regulations on the debt-servicing companies and passing a student bill of rights. State attorneys general have also brought new cases against some companies, including the industry giant Navient, for steering cash-short students away from federal loan forgiveness programs. \u201cWhen Secretary DeVos took office, we went on red alert,\u201d said Karl A. Racine, the District of Columbia\u2019s attorney general, whose residents have the highest debt burden, $40,000 per student borrower, in the country. \u201cWe have a responsibility, in the state attorney general\u2019s offices, to protect our consumers. We are trying to fill the gap because the secretary is stepping away from protecting students.\u201d Mr. Frotman helped lead the investigation that resulted in a lawsuit in January 2017 charging that Navient, the nation\u2019s biggest servicing company, \u201cillegally cheated many struggling borrowers.\u201d In July, the chief of Navient, Jack Remondi, called on the bureau \u201cto move on\u201d and drop the lawsuit. Mr. Mulvaney has not said if he plans to do that, but Mr. Frotman accused him of political interference in the case, a charge that Mr. Mulvaney denies. Ms. DeVos, who hired the dean of the embattled for-profit DeVry University to lead the unit that oversees fraud investigations, believes that the bureau under Mr. Frotman\u2019s mentor, the former director Richard Cordray, acted too often without consulting Education Department officials, Ms. Hill said. The failure to hold companies accountable, Mr. Frotman and his allies say, has far-reaching consequences. The debt owed by 44 million students now exceeds $1.5 trillion \u2014 larger than national auto or credit card debt. One million borrowers already default every year, and 40 percent of students are expected to default on their loans by 2023, according to a January study by Brookings. Education Department officials said Ms. DeVos was trying to recalibrate the department\u2019s student loan division after eight years of regulatory overreach by the Obama administration. In July, Ms. DeVos announced plans to replace Obama administration policies by making more data available to students about for-profit institutions and servicers \u2014 placing responsibility for identifying low-performing schools on the students themselves. As part of that effort, the department is developing a mobile phone app to help students keep track of their finances and expenses, Ms. Hill said. \u201cPostsecondary students are adults who can be reasonably expected to make informed decisions and who must take personal accountability for the decisions they make,\u201d department officials wrote in a summary of the proposal in July. But in court filings, the Justice Department argued to shield companies from having to release detailed information about their performance to state and local officials. The District of Columbia\u2019s law, they wrote, requires companies to make disclosures that were meant to be \u201cconfidential unless the federal government\u201d authorizes them. The brief was similar to one the government filed in March supporting another industry lawsuit trying to block Massachusetts from taking its own steps. In 2017, the state sued the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency, a quasi-governmental group that services a quarter of the country\u2019s student loan debt, for deceptive marketing and steering borrowers away from loan forgiveness programs. \u201cStates have always had the ability to protect the health and welfare of their residents, and we are attempting to do that,\u201d said the attorney general of Illinois, Lisa Madigan, whose office has brought its own case against Navient over collection practices and the terms of some of their loans. \u201cThis is the same exact battle we fought during the mortgage crisis, when federal regulators weren\u2019t holding lenders accountable and we had to step in,\u201d said Ms. Madigan, a Democrat. \u201cBetsy DeVos and the Department of Education are abandoning any sort of commitment to the hard-working Americans who are trapped in student loan debt.\u201d Ms. Hill denied those charges, saying that enforcement actions at the department rose last year in comparison to the final year of the Obama administration. \"We do our jobs, period. It\u2019s not about getting credit in the press,\u201d she added. Mr. Frotman \u2014 like many other career officials inside the bureau and Education Department \u2014 spent months pushing back against Mr. Trump\u2019s appointees but eventually tired of the battle, friends said. Mr. Mulvaney, who once called the bureau a \u201csad, sick joke,\u201d had long marginalized his team, downgrading Mr. Frotman\u2019s unit, tucking it inside the financial education information division. He never met with Mr. Frotman, and his deputies avoided even routine interactions with the student consumer protection team, according to two former officials. But Mr. Frotman\u2019s effort to defeat Ms. DeVos in the states might prevail in the end. Mr. Racine said he was optimistic about his chances of winning his case. And judges in Illinois, Florida and Washington, presiding in lawsuits against Navient and other servicers, have rejected federal supremacy arguments similar to those being made by the Trump administration.",

GreenPRINT EDITIONDeVos Plans to Reshape Sexual Misconduct Rules|August 30, 2018, Page A1",
      "author": "Erica L. Green",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Education Secretary Betsy DeVos is preparing new policies on campus sexual misconduct that would bolster the rights of students accused of assault, harassment or rape, reduce liability for institutions of higher education and encourage schools to provide more support for victims. The proposed rules, obtained by The New York Times, narrow the definition of sexual harassment, holding schools accountable only for formal complaints filed through proper authorities and for conduct said to have occurred on their campuses. They would also establish a higher legal standard to determine whether schools improperly addressed complaints. The new rules would come at a particularly sensitive time, as major institutions such as Ohio State University, the University of Southern California and Michigan State University deal with explosive charges that members of their faculty and staff have perpetrated serious sexual misconduct. But for several years, higher education administrators have maintained that sexual misconduct rules pressed by the Obama administration unnecessarily burdened them with bureaucratic mandates that had little to do with assault or harassment, and men\u2019s rights groups have said the accused have had little recourse. Unlike the Obama administration\u2019s guidance documents, the Trump administration\u2019s new rules will have the force of law and can go into force without an act of Congress, after a public comment period. Liz Hill, an Education Department spokeswoman, said on Wednesday that the department was \u201cin the midst of a deliberative process.\u201d She added that any information obtained by The Times \u201cis premature and speculative, and therefore, we have no comment.\u201d Last fall, Ms. DeVos rescinded a 2011 letter prepared by the Obama administration that outlined the responsibilities of schools and colleges that receive federal funding to address episodes of sexual misconduct. Victims rights groups praised the Obama-era guidelines for aggressively holding schools accountable for complaints of sexual harassment, assault and rape that they said had often been played down or ignored. But critics contended that too often they trampled due-process rights for accused students. In announcing the rescission of the letter, Ms. DeVos assailed the guidelines as federal overreach that coerced schools into setting up quasi-judicial systems fraught with inconsistencies. \u201cThe truth is that the system established by the prior administration has failed too many students,\u201d Ms. DeVos said in September 2017. \u201cSurvivors, victims of a lack of due process and campus administrators have all told me that the current approach does a disservice to everyone involved.\u201d Ms. DeVos has also criticized the Obama administration for imposing rules without following the legal processes, which would allow for a public comment period. The department\u2019s proposal would preserve much of the law that protects against sex discrimination, called Title IX, which for the past two decades has extended beyond gender-specific discrimination to include sexual misconduct as a form of denying students access to an education. But for what appears to be the first time, the federal government would go beyond guidance and recommendations to codify how it defines sexual harassment in the nation\u2019s schools and the steps institutions are legally required to take to address it. They could also be revised before they are formally published. There is still dissension among employees in the Education and Justice Departments about whether more of the standards from guidance issued in 2001 should be codified in the new regulations, and whether some of the provisions should apply only to higher education, according to people familiar with the administration\u2019s deliberations. While the issue has centered on allegations against students on college campuses, it also applies to elementary and secondary schools and allegations against teachers, professors and other employees. \u201cThe department recognizes that despite well-intentioned efforts by school districts, colleges and universities, advocacy organizations and the department itself, sexual harassment and assault continue to present serious problems across the nation\u2019s campuses,\u201d the department wrote in the draft rule. \u201cThe lack of clear regulatory standards has contributed to processes that have not been fair to all parties involved, that have lacked appropriate procedural protections and that have undermined confidence in the reliability of the outcomes of investigations of sexual harassment allegations.\u201d Advocates of victims rights condemned the proposals. They are \u201ca tacit endorsement of making campuses a safer place to commit sexual assault, rather than a safer place to learn free from violence,\u201d said Jess Davidson, the executive director of End Rape on Campus. But groups that have long challenged the sexual assault policies under the Obama administration praised the proposed rules. \u201cGoing solely by what has so far been reported, it sounds as though the proposed rules will go a long way towards restoring meaningful due process protections to the campus justice system, which will benefit both accusers and the accused,\u201d said Robert L. Shibley, the executive director of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education. After the department rescinded the Obama letter and a subsequent question-and-answer document, it reinstated temporary guidelines, which drew from guidance issued in 2001 and a subsequent letter issued in 2006. The Obama administration built upon that guidance but had notable differences. The new regulations cement some of the most debated policy positions in the interim guidance, such as allowing schools to choose the evidentiary standard \u2014 \u201cpreponderance of evidence\u201d or \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidence \u2014 to apply in determining whether accused students are responsible for alleged misconduct. They also leave it to schools to decide whether to have an appeals process. The most protested part of the Obama administration guidance was the mandate that schools use the preponderance-of-evidence standard, the lower standard of the two, in determining whether those accused should be disciplined or expelled. The Trump administration rules propose that a school\u2019s choice of evidentiary standard must apply to any investigation of civil rights violations. The rules also maintain Ms. DeVos\u2019s year-old policy of using mediation to reach informal resolutions, and would add the ability for victims and their accused perpetrators to request evidence from each other and to cross-examine each other. The rules also allow the complainant and the accused to have access to any evidence obtained during the investigation, even if there are no plans to use it to prove the conduct occurred. The Obama administration held that mediation was not appropriate, even if voluntary. It also strongly discouraged parties from personally questioning each other during hearings, believing it would be \u201ctraumatic or intimidating, thereby possibly escalating or perpetuating a hostile environment.\u201d The previous administration also recommended that schools provide an appeals process. The new rules would adopt a new Supreme Court definition of \u201csexual harassment\u201d that appears to be reserved for repeated complaints or the most egregious allegations. The new rules would define sexual harassment to mean \u201cunwelcome conduct on the basis of sex that is so severe, pervasive and objectively offensive that it denies a person access to the school\u2019s education program or activity.\u201d In its guidance, the Obama administration defined the act more broadly as \u201cunwelcome conduct of a sexual nature,\u201d that includes \u201cunwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal, nonverbal, or physical conduct of a sexual nature.\u201d The proposed regulations do not define what constitutes a \u201chostile environment\u201d for victims as previous guidance did, but does allow a school to remove an accused person from campus after conducting a safety and risk assessment. The new rules would require that institutions only be held legally responsible for investigating formal complaints and responding to reports that school officials have \u201cactual knowledge\u201d of happening. A formal complaint is one made to \u201can official who has the authority to institute corrective measures,\u201d not, for instance, a residential adviser in a dormitory. The regulation contrasts with the standard, dating to 2001, that a \u201cschool knows, or reasonably should know, about possible harassment.\u201d College leaders have long complained that was too broad and held them accountable for allegations of which they were not aware. Under the new rules, schools would be held to a new standard for determining whether they took the proper steps to address the allegations. That standard, called \u201cdeliberately indifferent,\u201d means that an institution is found in violation of the law \u201conly if its response to the sexual harassment is clearly unreasonable in light of known circumstances.\u201d The new rules would also hold schools responsible only for investigating episodes reported to have taken place within their own programs, or on their campuses, not, for instance, in off-campus parties. The Obama administration required that schools investigate a complaint regardless of where the conduct initially took place. The rules also say that the government will not penalize schools if they provide \u201csupportive measures\u201d to victims who choose to forgo filing a written complaint. The regulations encourage measures that are \u201cnondisciplinary individualized services\u201d and \u201cnonpunitive, time-limited and narrowly tailored\u201d to keep students in school. The rules provide an extensive list of options, such as counseling, deadline extensions, changes in class schedules, campus escort services, mutual restrictions on contact between the parties, changes in housing, leaves of absences or increased security and monitoring. The regulations go to great lengths to require impartiality in investigations. They call on schools to conduct objective investigations and provide \u201cprompt and equitable\u201d resolutions. And, for the first time, the administration explicitly says that just as an institution\u2019s treatment of a complainant could constitute sex discrimination, so would the treatment of the accused. The regulations require that schools approach all investigations under the presumption that the accused is innocent until proved guilty.",

Begins Dismissing Civil Rights Cases in Name of EfficiencyThe department has begun dismissing civil rights cases brought by \u201cserial\u201d complainants or those that place \u201can unreasonable burden\u201d on resources.By Erica L. GreenPRINT EDITIONEducation Dept. Aims for Efficiency by Dismissing Rights Cases|April 21, 2018, Page A14",
      "author": "Erica L. Green",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 The Education Department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights has begun dismissing hundreds of civil rights complaints under a new protocol that allows investigators to disregard cases that are part of serial filings or that they consider burdensome to the office. Department officials said the new policy targeted advocates who flooded the office with thousands of complaints for similar violations, jamming its investigation pipeline with cases that could be resolved without exhausting staff and resources. But civil rights advocates worry that the office\u2019s rejection of legitimate claims is the most obvious example to date of its diminishing role in enforcing civil rights laws in the nation\u2019s schools. Liz Hill, a spokeswoman for the Education Department, said the new provision was part of the office\u2019s revision of its manual that lays out procedures for processing civil rights cases. The goal of the new manual, which took effect last month, is to help the office better manage its docket, investigations and resolutions, she said. Among the changes implemented immediately is a provision that allows the Office for Civil Rights to dismiss cases that reflect \u201ca pattern of complaints previously filed with O.C.R. by an individual or a group against multiple recipients,\u201d or complaints \u201cfiled for the first time against multiple recipients that\u201d place \u201can unreasonable burden on O.C.R.\u2019s resources.\u201d So far, the provision has resulted in the dismissal of more than 500 disability rights complaints. Catherine E. Lhamon, who led the Office for Civil Rights under the Obama administration, said the new provision undermined the mission of the office. Unlike the Justice Department, the Education Department cannot pick and choose the cases it pursues. If the office has evidence that the law has been violated, it must open a case. \u201cThe thing that scares me is when they get to say \u2018we won\u2019t open some cases because it\u2019s too much for us,\u2019 or \u2018we don\u2019t like the complainant,\u2019 or \u2018it\u2019s not our week to work on that,\u2019 you start to change the character of the office,\u201d Ms. Lhamon said. But Debora L. Osgood, a lawyer who worked for 25 years at the Office for Civil Rights and now consults with and represents schools on civil rights matters, praised the change. She said the provision showed that the agency was \u201cessentially taking the reins back for control of its complaint docket.\u201d Ms. Osgood said that in her experience, one person could clog the pipeline in each of the agency\u2019s 12 regional offices, limiting investigators\u2019 ability to respond to other complaints. It often frustrated investigators who prided themselves on being able to resolve complaints promptly, she said. \u201cIn effect, it turned over the decision-making about how the agency would use many of its resources to a single individual, rather than to agency officials and staff charged with the responsibility for implementing the agency\u2019s stated mission,\u201d she said. According to the Education Department, 41 percent of the 16,720 complaints filed in the 2016 fiscal year came from three people. The next year, of the 12,837 total cases, 23 percent of them did. The department calls the complainants \u201cfrequent fliers.\u201d Marcie Lipsitt is proud to be one of them. In the last two years, Ms. Lipsitt, a disability rights advocate in Michigan, has filed more than 2,400 complaints with the office against schools, departments of education, colleges and universities, libraries and other educational institutions across the country that have websites that people who are deaf or blind or who struggle with fine motor skills cannot navigate. \u201cNo one even knew about this issue until I started filing,\u201d Ms. Lipsitt said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to get anybody in trouble. I just wanted to raise awareness.\u201d She has secured more than 1,000 agreements with institutions that committed to bringing their websites into compliance with the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities and requires that electronic and information technologies be accessible to them. In recent weeks, Ms. Lipsitt said, she has received notice that more than 500 cases, including active and open investigations, were dismissed. Each letter cited the new provision as the reason. The department will instead work with colleges on complying with web accessibility laws. \u201cBut I won\u2019t stop,\u201d Ms. Lipsitt vowed, \u201cbecause if I do, the story goes away.\u201d The new manual also eliminates an appeals process for Office for Civil Rights decisions \u2014 department officials said it usually resulted in the same outcome \u2014 and says complaints can no longer be filed on the basis of journal articles and news media reports. The manual also drops all mention of investigators\u2019 looking into \u201csystemic issues.\u201d However, the department said that the new provision would not apply to class-action-like complaints filed by groups. The changes worry civil rights groups, which point out that Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has already rescinded guidances meant to protect students against sexual assaults on campuses and black and transgender students against bias. Neena Chaudhry, associate general counsel and senior adviser of education at the National Women\u2019s Law Center, said that by filing dozens of complaints in recent decades, the group has been able to secure equal scholarship money and increased sports opportunities for female athletes. Now, as the organization shifts its focus to sexual assault, the department may prove less responsive. Rachel M. Kleinman, senior counsel at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, said that the new manual was \u201cyet another avenue for O.C.R. to not seriously investigate systemic race discrimination.\u201d The group has filed complaints on behalf of large groups of black students it believes were being disproportionately affected by law enforcement policies. Already, one case has been closed by the DeVos administration, and the department declined to conduct a broader analysis. \u201cThey seem to be closing all of the pathways for students to have their rights enforced by the federal government,\u201d Ms. Kleinman said. Ms. DeVos\u2019s Office for Civil Rights has maintained that it wants to be more efficient and effective than it was under the Obama administration, which was known for its aggressive enforcement and broad investigations but was also accused of being overzealous and leaving cases languishing for years. Ms. Osgood said such changes would be welcomed by the colleges and universities that she assists with federal civil rights investigations. She said the changes showed that the department was willing to work with schools in a \u201cmore reasonable, more nimble and more expeditious manner.\u201d The department did not say how its investigators would determine that a case would place an \u201cunreasonable burden\u201d on its resources. However, just weeks after the new manual took effect, Congress allocated $8.5 million more in funding to the Office for Civil Rights, which Ms. DeVos had sought to cut, in order for the office to manage its caseload. Ms. Lhamon said that, in her time in the office, she sought out ways to manage large volumes of cases that stemmed from one complainant, and she acknowledged that her office struggled with timely responses. But she said she could not come up with any measure that would not shortchange an investigation. \u201cThere\u2019s not a limitation on justice, and there\u2019s not a limitation on how we perceive injustice,\u201d Ms. Lhamon said. \u201cTo say you\u2019ve reached your quota is to say that there\u2019s somehow a cap on the number of children who might be harmed.\u201d",

      "author": "Kate Zernike",
      "content": " Nominees for secretary of education have typically breezed through confirmation by the Senate with bipartisan approval. But Betsy DeVos, President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s choice for the post, is no typical nominee. She is a billionaire with a complex web of financial investments, including in companies that stand to win or lose from the department she would oversee. She has been an aggressive force in politics for years, as a prominent Republican donor and as a supporter of steering public dollars to private schools. Her wealth and her politics seem likely to make her confirmation hearing unusually contentious, and possibly drawn out. The hearing, which was originally scheduled for Wednesday of this week, was postponed until Tuesday after Democrats complained she had not completed an agreement with the independent Office of Government Ethics that outlined a plan to deal with potential conflicts of interest. The ethics office has said it has not completed its review of Ms. DeVos, which is required before the office can make any agreement. A spokesman for Ms. DeVos said she had responded to a first round of questions from the office last weekend. On Thursday, Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the ranking Democrat on the committee that will hold the hearing, said she and Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, the panel\u2019s Republican chairman, \u201chave some concerns about missing information\u201d on the financial disclosure forms that Ms. DeVos has filed with the Senate. Ms. Murray would not specify what they were looking for, because those disclosures are not public, but said they had asked Ms. DeVos for additional information. Ms. Murray said she had \u201cpushed very hard\u201d not to hold the hearing until Ms. DeVos had completed her agreement with the ethics office. \u201cThis is a candidate with extremely complicated financial dealings,\u201d the senator said. \u201cWe have to know, if there are conflicts of interests, how those are going to be resolved. If we don\u2019t have that, it\u2019s incumbent on all of us to say we cannot vote for that.\u201d Some Republican committee leaders, including Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who is chairwoman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, have said they will hew to a tradition of not holding hearings until the ethics office signs off on the nominee. But a spokeswoman for Mr. Alexander said his panel \u2014 the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee \u2014 had \u201cno rules\u201d about a need for an ethics review, and that the chairman intended to hold the hearing on Tuesday regardless. Mr. Alexander also said he would limit senators on the panel \u2014 12 Republicans and 11 Democrats \u2014 to five minutes of questions each, after opening statements by him and Ms. Murray. His office noted that Rod Paige, President George W. Bush\u2019s first education secretary, had a hearing eight days before his ethics review was complete. But Mr. Paige, a school superintendent when he was nominated, did not have nearly the same wealth or financial investments as Ms. DeVos. Mr. Alexander\u2019s office said the committee would not hold a vote on Ms. DeVos\u2019s nomination until her ethics review was complete. That could take awhile. In a letter to Ms. Murray about the DeVos nomination, the ethics office said on Monday that \u201cmultiple rounds of questions and revisions are usually needed before a report can be finalized,\u201d because of the complexity of financial disclosure rules. And some nominees \u201cfind it difficult to untangle\u201d their investments quickly. So the vetting process \u201ccan take weeks,\u201d the office wrote, \u201cand, in the case of extremely wealthy individuals, sometimes months.\u201d Democrats have repeatedly noted that Penny Pritzker, a billionaire real estate entrepreneur who became the commerce secretary during President Obama\u2019s second term, took six months to complete her ethics agreement. Ms. DeVos and her husband have a larger fortune, estimated at $5 billion. The Windquest Group, their investment firm, has holdings in many companies that invest in other interests such as Social Finance, which refinances student loans \u2014 a potential conflict, given the federal government is the biggest student lender. Ms. DeVos also lists herself as a director of the RDV Corporation, which similarly invests in companies with education products, including digital textbooks and online charter schools. Unlike most past secretaries, Ms. DeVos has never been an educator or overseen a state education agency. She did not attend public schools, or send her children to them. Her primary involvement in education has been as a benefactor and board member for groups that advocate steering taxpayer dollars away from public schools in the form of vouchers to help families attend private and religious schools. In her home state, Michigan, she pushed and defended a charter school law that is lax compared with policies in other states. She consistently fought legislation that would stop failing charter schools from expanding, and argued to shut down the troubled Detroit public school system and use the money saved to send students to charters or private schools. A Republican group pushing for Ms. DeVos\u2019s confirmation, America Rising Squared, has flooded reporters with testimonials from supporters and politicians who say Ms. DeVos is in line with \u201cmainstream\u201d Americans in her support of school choice. That group, and one calling itself Friends of Betsy DeVos, insist that the opposition to her nomination is funded by teachers\u2019 unions that want to deny poor families a way out of failing schools. But school choice means different things to different people. Many educators and groups that support charter schools \u2014 which are public \u2014 do not support vouchers, which steer public money away from public schools by giving families money to spend on private school tuition. So teachers\u2019 unions have opposed her nomination, but so, too, have organizations that have fought unions. The main association of charter schools in Massachusetts, for example, which is generally considered to have the nation\u2019s best charters, sent a letter to the state\u2019s senior senator, Elizabeth Warren, who sits on the committee that will hold the DeVos hearing. The letter expressed concern about Ms. DeVos\u2019s support for vouchers and loose accountability in Michigan, which it said would \u201creduce the quality of charter schools across the country.\u201d Mr. Trump has promised to steer $20 billion in federal education funds to vouchers, and Shavar Jeffries, the president of Democrats for Education Reform, a pro-charter organization, said he was worried that the Department of Education would take the money from Title I funds, which go to public schools serving the poorest students. Other groups have noted Ms. DeVos\u2019s millions of dollars in political contributions to Republican senators who will vote on her nomination, insisting that they recuse themselves from any vote on her. Her supporters have countered that Democrats who receive money from teachers\u2019 unions should recuse themselves, as well.",

      "content": " Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who made a career of promoting local control of education, has signaled a surprisingly hard-line approach to carrying out an expansive new federal education law, issuing critical feedback that has rattled state school chiefs and conservative education experts alike. President Barack Obama signed the Every Student Succeeds Act in 2015 as the less intrusive successor to the No Child Left Behind law, which was maligned by many in both political parties as punitive and prescriptive. But in the Education Department\u2019s feedback to states about their plans to put the new law into effect, it applied strict interpretations of statutes, required extensive detail and even deemed some state education goals lackluster. In one case, the acting assistant secretary for elementary and secondary education, Jason Botel, wrote to the State of Delaware that its long-term goals for student achievement were not \u201cambitious.\u201d \u201cIt is mind-boggling that the department could decide that it\u2019s going to challenge them on what\u2019s ambitious,\u201d said Michael J. Petrilli, the president of the conservative-leaning Thomas B. Fordham Institute, who worked in the Education Department under President George W. Bush. He called the letter \u201cdirectly in opposition to the rhetoric and the promises of DeVos.\u201d After more than a decade of strict federal education standards and standardized testing regimes, the Every Student Succeeds Act was to return latitude to the states to come up with plans to improve student achievement and hold schools accountable for student performance. It sought to relieve states from the federal pressures of its predecessor, which required that 100 percent of the students of every school reach proficiency on state tests or the school would face harsh penalties and aggressive interventions. Unlike No Child Left Behind, the new law does not set numerical achievement targets, nor does it mandate how a state should intervene if a school fails to reach them. The law does require that states set such benchmarks on their own. Proponents, especially congressional Republicans and conservative education advocates, believed that a new era of local control would flourish under Ms. DeVos, who pointed to the new law as illustrative of the state-level empowerment she champions. But her department\u2019s feedback reflects a tension between ideology and legal responsibility: While she has said she would like to see her office\u2019s role in running the nation\u2019s public schools diminished, she has also said she will uphold the law. \u201cAll of the signals she has been sending is that she\u2019s going to approve any plan that follows the law,\u201d Mr. Petrilli said. \u201cAnd when in doubt, she\u2019s going to give the states the benefit of the doubt.\u201d Mr. Botel defended the department\u2019s feedback, saying it was measuring state plans against federal statutes \u2014 including a requirement that plans be ambitious. \u201cBecause the statute does not define the word \u2018ambitious,\u2019 the secretary has the responsibility of determining whether a state\u2019s long-term goals are ambitious,\u201d Mr. Botel said. In the department\u2019s letter to Delaware \u2014 which incited the most outrage from conservative observers \u2014 Mr. Botel took aim at the state\u2019s plan to halve the number of students not meeting proficiency rates in the next decade. Such a goal would have resulted in only one-half to two thirds of some groups of students achieving proficiency, he noted. The department deemed those long-term goals, as well as those for English-language learners, not ambitious, and directed the state to revise its plans to make them more so. So far, 16 states and the District of Columbia have submitted plans, and more states will present plans in the fall. Delaware, New Mexico and Nevada were the first three to be reviewed by Education Department staff and a panel of peer reviewers. State education officials in Delaware said they had spent a year engaging the community on their plan and would resubmit it with clarifications. But Atnre Alleyne, the executive director of DelawareCAN, an advocacy group that helped draft the plan, agreed with the department\u2019s findings. He said that his group had challenged the state about accountability measures, such as setting firm goals and consequences for failing to meet them, and found that \u201cthere was a lot of fear about being bold or aggressive\u201d after No Child Left Behind. \u201cUltimately this has to be about every student succeeding, so to say that one-third are going to be proficient in 10 years, the department is right to call that into question,\u201d Mr. Alleyne said. \u201cA lot of people thought it was just going to be a breeze. I was glad to see it was a push.\u201d Since Ms. DeVos was confirmed, civil rights and education advocates have expressed concern that state plans would get assembly-line approval and states would be allowed to skirt responsibility for low-performing and historically underserved students. For all of its flaws, the No Child Left Behind Act was praised for holding schools accountable for performance data. Under the law, a school was considered failing if all of its student groups, including all racial and ethnic groups, English-language learners and students with disabilities, did not meet annual achievement targets. By the end of the law, more than half of the nation\u2019s schools were considered failures. But even after the first round of feedback, the advocates would like the department to be more aggressive and reject any state plan that lacks specifics on how they will account for the performance of historically underperforming and underserved student populations. \u201cPushback and feedback in and of themselves are of no interest and of no value,\u201d said Liz King, the director of education policy at the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. Chad Aldeman, a principal at Bellwether Education Partners, who led an independent examination of state plans, said that some states, like Louisiana, New Mexico and Tennessee, had innovative plans to improve student achievement. But Mr. Aldeman agreed that many state plans reflected \u201cprocess without specificity\u201d when it came to the two most important parts of the new law \u2014 identifying how schools will account for the performance of all students, and how states plan to intervene in low-performing schools. And Ms. DeVos and Republican lawmakers were partly to blame. \u201cThe administration has signaled that they\u2019re willing to take plans that are half-baked, and we\u2019re seeing plans that aren\u2019t finished and are not complete,\u201d Mr. Aldeman said. Christopher Ruszkowski, the acting secretary for the New Mexico Public Education Department, said the idea that the new law would yield total state control was merely \u201crhetoric from the Beltway.\u201d \u201cI think a lot of the euphoria over return to local control was an overpromise,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat this signals is that U.S.D.E. will continue to play the role they\u2019ve always played in the years ahead.\u201d In feedback for five more states \u2014 Connecticut, Louisiana, New Jersey, Oregon and Tennessee \u2014 the Education Department avoided criticizing the ambitions of the state plans. But it did maintain its scrutiny. For example, the department noted that Tennessee neglected to identify, as the law requires, languages other than English spoken among its student population because it considers itself \u201can English-only state.\u201d According to the state\u2019s population profile, nearly 50,000 students speak English as a second language. And in Connecticut\u2019s plan, the department pointed out that the state discussed ways to identify schools that had \u201cconsistently underperforming\u201d student groups, but did not actually define what that meant. The state was also criticized for its use of an alternative system for measuring academic performance instead of more standard \u201cproficiency\u201d measurements on state tests, as the law requires. Such feedback signaled that the department \u201cappears to be resorting to very traditional and narrow ways of interpreting student and school performance,\u201d said Laura Stefon, chief of staff for the Connecticut State Department of Education. Connecticut was also among a handful of states faulted for including science as a subject for measuring achievement, even though the law allows the use only of reading and math. This feedback was widely criticized by academic groups, including the National Science Teachers Association, who said the department was interpreting the law too literally. State leaders said they believed they were all but promised their plans would be approved. Instead, Chris Minnich, the executive director of the Council of Chief State School Officers, said some aspects of the Education Department\u2019s feedback were \u201coverzealous\u201d and could undermine community involvement. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be really hard for a state to go back and say, \u2018I know I told you we were doing all of this, but we\u2019re going to change it because the federal government told us not to,\u2019\u201d Mr. Minnich said.",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 When Education Secretary Betsy DeVos began rolling back regulations to curb the predatory practices of for-profit colleges, critics seethed that the Trump administration was throwing yet another lifeline to a rapacious industry \u2014 in this case, one that sees vulnerable undergraduates as nothing more than moneymaking targets. Henry N. Tisdale, the president of the small campus of Claflin University in Orangeburg, S.C., disagrees. Since the Obama administration announced that it would establish a smoother pathway for students to claim that they had been misled by their colleges, Mr. Tisdale said he has feared an expensive legal battle over the smallest leaflet advertising a service on campus. \u201cA small mistake or error at a college like Claflin could put us out of business,\u201d Mr. Tisdale said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the resources ready to respond to frivolous claims. Mr. Tisdale and his counterparts at other small, historically black colleges and universities are among an unlikely cohort of supporters for Ms. DeVos\u2019s effort to tighten a wide-ranging regulation that offers federal debt relief to students who were defrauded or deceived by their higher-education institutions. While the rules targeted for-profit colleges with billion-dollar budgets, they apply to all institutions \u2014 including small, nonprofit colleges like Claflin that have been educating low-income, minority and first-generation students for more than a century without scandal. \u201cIt\u2019s a regulation that should be focused on the bad actors, and we have been lumped in when we\u2019re serving the students the bad actors are preying on,\u201d Mr. Tisdale said. \u201cWe believe it should be improved to prevent unintended consequences.\u201d Ms. DeVos\u2019s plans to overhaul the Obama-era rules for student borrowers reached a crucial stage this week, as a committee convened to renegotiate the regulations began debating the burden of proof students would have to meet to win claims against institutions. The Education Department has proposed that students establish \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d that institutions misled them, compared with a \u201cpreponderance of evidence\u201d standard applied under the Obama administration. Students would also have to prove that institutions had an \u201cintent to deceive,\u201d \u201cknowledge of falsity\u201d and \u201creckless disregard\u201d that resulted in financial harm to borrowers. Officials in the department said during negotiations this week that they believed the current preponderance-of-evidence standard did not sufficiently protect taxpayers and institutions. But Joseline Garcia, a negotiator on the panel and the president of the United States Student Association, said she believed the new standard swung too far in the opposite direction. \u201cI think that switching to \u2018clear and convincing\u2019 does the opposite for students,\u201d Ms. Garcia said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t protect them at all.\u201d She added: \u201cAlthough the institution may have made an honest mistake, the harm is still the same for the student. And people\u2019s lives are greatly impacted by that harm.\u201d Ms. DeVos has cast the Obama-era regulations as taxpayer-funded money grabs. In announcing the repeal of the rules, she said that institutions of all types raised concerns about \u201cexcessively broad definitions of substantial misrepresentation and breach of contract, the lack of meaningful due process protections for institutions and \u2018financial triggers\u2019 under the new rules.\u201d The United Negro College Fund, which has joined the chorus of criticism over the Trump administration\u2019s lack of tangible commitment to historically black colleges and universities, has long been among the most vocal opponents of the Obama-era rules. Since the rules were announced in 2015, the college fund has expressed concern that they could threaten the viability of its 37 member institutions, which include Claflin, Spelman College, Morehouse College and Shaw University. The member institutions collectively educate 60,000 students on campuses of about 2,000 or fewer, and 75 percent of their students receive federal Pell grants. The fund has said that the rules have a disproportionately negative effect on their member institutions because they have historically been underfinanced and serve vulnerable populations. They fear having to spend thousands of dollars fighting claims instead of backing academic programming at institutions that have been graduating students who consistently post high success and satisfaction rates. Representatives at the United Negro College Fund are among the panelists hashing out the new standards and are in a unique position of having to represent both students and institutions. \u201cWe want to make sure this is a balanced process,\u201d said Lodriguez V. Murray, one of the college fund\u2019s members on the federal negotiating team. \u201cWe\u2019re protecting students and the institutions that are giving them a chance to fall into the middle class.\u201d Consumer rights and student advocates say the new standards essentially ask students who probably cannot afford to hire lawyers to become them. \u201cThe administration is effectively asking borrowers to have conducted a full investigation, with the power of discovery, that turns up some very severe findings from their institution before filing a borrower-defense claim,\u201d said Clare McCann, the deputy director for federal higher education policy at the New America Foundation. Education Department officials on the rule-making committee said they could not outline how a student would meet the new burden of proof. But they said they believed, based on the claims that they have reviewed, that students could meet the standards if they were informed about them. But others on the committee expressed concerns that the department had another goal. \u201cThis would effectively do away with borrowers\u2019 ability to get relief in almost all circumstances,\u201d said Abby Shafroth, a lawyer at the National Consumer Law Center. The department has struggled to complete a backlog of borrower-defense claims, the bulk of which were overwhelmingly against for-profit colleges, that began pouring in under the Obama administration and swelled to more than 100,000 in the last year. The department attributed the backlog, in part, to an insufficient system established under the Obama administration, which relieved students of $450 million in loan debt after the collapse of Corinthian Colleges and ITT Technical Institute. Ms. DeVos announced last month that her department would begin notifying more than 20,000 students whether their claims had been approved. Some would see only partial relief under the new system. Lawyers who represent institutions on the negotiating team said that due process standards were crucial to their constituents because colleges could be held liable for some of the student debt \u201cWe all have bad actors. But in trying to get to the bad guys, are you allocating too much risk on the good guys?\u201d asked Aaron Lacey, a lawyer at Thompson Coburn L.L.P., which represents schools in regulatory litigation. In addition to establishing a new burden of proof for student borrowers who feel defrauded, the department is relaxing financial accountability rules for institutions. Those so-called triggers would have required colleges to take a series of steps to demonstrate their financial health. One such trigger that the United Negro College Fund opposed would have penalized schools if they had a high number of students defaulting on their loans. (Statistics show that the populations that black colleges serve tend to have higher default rates.) That trigger was stricken from the new proposed standards, while others that applied solely to for-profits remained but were made discretionary rather than required.",

      "content": "    \u25a0 The Senate approved Betsy DeVos as education secretary, with Vice President Pence breaking a tie vote. \u25a0 President Trump says \u201chaters\u201d unfairly interpret his praise of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. \u25a0 A federal appeals court in San Francisco will hear arguments on Mr. Trump\u2019s targeted immigration ban. \u25a0 Melania Trump settles a libel lawsuit against a Maryland blogger. The Senate confirmed Ms. DeVos as education secretary on Tuesday, in a vote that required Vice President Mike Pence to break a 50 to 50 tie. Two Republican senators, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, announced last week that they would join Democrats in blocking her. Democrats employed every procedural tool to slow the confirmation of Ms. DeVos. Republican leaders responded by saying they would simply keep the Senate in session until a few key individuals were approved: Ms. DeVos, Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama for attorney general, Representative Tom Price of Georgia for secretary of health and human services and Steven T. Mnuchin for Treasury secretary. While Ms. DeVos was confirmed, 51 to 50, thanks to Mr. Pence and the support of another important constituent: President Trump\u2019s foreign-policy-by-tweet approach continued Tuesday morning, with the president suggesting on Twitter that \u201chaters\u201d were unfairly criticizing his praise of Mr. Putin. The post appears to be a direct response to the criticism Mr. Trump received for his comments during a Fox News interview. In that interview, he seemed to defend Mr. Putin\u2019s brutality while saying that American political leaders have \u201ckilled\u201d people too. The president appears to think that the avalanche of criticism he received is unfair, even though his insistence that he doesn\u2019t know Mr. Putin or have deals in Russia is unrelated to his praise of the Russian president. The website of the federal appeals court in San Francisco is about to be tested. The court will hear arguments at 3 p.m. Pacific time on Tuesday on the Trump administration\u2019s emergency request to reinstate Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order suspending travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries and limiting the nation\u2019s refugee program. The argument in the fast-moving case will be heard by telephone, and the court at first said it would release a recording afterward. An hour and a half later, the court thought better of the delay, now saying the hearing would be live-streamed on its site. You can listen to a live stream of the arguments here: The president had some thoughts to share on the subject. For a moment, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan seemed to be in the clear. Amid the now-typical deluge of questions for Mr. Ryan about the latest explosive comment from Mr. Trump, a reporter acknowledged the speaker\u2019s standard reply: that he does not tend to comment on the \u201ctweet of the day.\u201d \u201cYou got my talking points down already!\u201d Mr. Ryan said, perking up. He did elaborate, though, steering clear of any remark that could be construed as a knock on the president. On the subject of Mr. Trump\u2019s insistence that the news media had willfully ignored or played down international terrorist attacks: \u201cI can\u2019t speak to whether or not you\u2019re over or underreporting something. That\u2019s your job. I\u2019ll stick with doing mine.\u201d On Mr. Trump attacking who he called the \u201cso-called judge\u201d responsible for blocking the president\u2019s immigration order: \u201cLook, he\u2019s not the first president to get frustrated with a ruling from a court.\u201d On the uncertainty wrought by the president\u2019s recent suggestion that the Affordable Care Act might not be replaced until next year: \u201cI think there\u2019s a little confusion here.\u201d The legislative process will have played out this year, Mr. Ryan said. \u201cThe question is, how long does it take to implement the full replacement of Obamacare?\u201d First lady Melania Trump has settled a libel lawsuit against a Maryland blogger over a blog post published in August that she said contained \u201cfalse and defamatory statements,\u201d including that she once worked as a high-end escort. The lawsuit, which was filed in September in Montgomery County, Md., pertained to a post that Webster G. Tarpley had published on his blog, Tarpley.net, in early August. Mr. Tarpley retracted the post on Aug. 22 and issued an apology to Mrs. Trump. In a statement, Mr. Tarpley again issued a retraction and apologized to Mrs. Trump for publishing a post that was \u201creplete with false and defamatory statements about her.\u201d \u201cI acknowledge that these false statements were very harmful and hurtful to Mrs. Trump and her family, and therefore I sincerely apologize to Mrs. Trump, her son, her husband and her parents for making these false statements,\u201d he said. Charles J. Harder, a lawyer for Mrs. Trump, said in statement on his client\u2019s behalf that Mr. Tarpley had agreed to pay Mrs. Trump \u201ca substantial sum as a settlement.\u201d In addition to Mr. Tarpley, Mrs. Trump sued the publisher of The Daily Mail for libel. (The Daily Mail also published a retraction and apology.) A Maryland judge dismissed the lawsuit against The Daily Mail publisher last week after determining that Maryland courts do not have jurisdiction over Mrs. Trump\u2019s claims; the lawsuit was refiled on Monday in New York State Court. Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Ted Cruz of Texas will square off in a debate that liberal and conservative purists probably would have preferred in 2016 \u2014 a bronze medal game, of sorts, for the presidency. The CNN town hall-style meeting will focus largely on the Affordable Care Act in the age of Trump. We\u2019ll bring real-time analysis \u2014 policy, yuks, everything in between \u2014 from the reporters who covered the pair during their presidential runs and from a health policy expert. Matt Flegenheimer, @mattfleg on Twitter, who covered Mr. Cruz; Yamiche Alcindor, @yamiche, who covered Mr. Sanders; and Margot Sanger-Katz, @sangerkatz, who writes extensively on health care policy, will be sorting out the facts from the froth. Make it a two-screen experience. The debate begins at 9 p.m. Eastern time.",

GreenPRINT EDITIONMarch 21, 2018",
      "author": "Erica L. Green",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Education Secretary Betsy DeVos will go before a House panel on Tuesday to defend her agency\u2019s budget, including a sweeping overhaul of the Education Department that has strained relations within her agency and with Congress \u2014 and defies the White House\u2019s budget office. In recent weeks, Ms. DeVos has clashed fiercely with department staff members over the plan, which they say she tried to withhold from Congress as she imposed on the department what they call an illegal collective bargaining agreement. Ms. DeVos will testify before the House Appropriations Committee, whose staff was told a week ago that her office had withheld vital information from it regarding the department\u2019s budget for the fiscal year that begins in October. The budget request calls for a 5 percent spending cut, eliminates dozens of programs and pitches a $1 billion school choice proposal. It also includes a shake-up of several divisions that is already underway. A career department official unveiled details of Ms. DeVos\u2019s \u201cEducation Reform Plan\u201d in an email to staff members on the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. The email, obtained by The Times, said information driving budget decisions was omitted from budget justifications submitted to Congress. \u201cOur concern is about a breakdown in communication, a culture of secrecy and a fear of retaliatory action that has prevented Budget Service from providing House and Senate appropriators and staff, and for that matter, the public, with key information about the department\u2019s plans for fiscal year 2019,\u201d the email said. \u201cGiven the potential for some of these proposals to radically impact the way the department carries out its mission, Congress should probably see this.\u201d Among the proposals outlined in the 56-page plan, obtained by The Times, was the consolidation of a number of administrative offices, cutting the number of regional offices in the Office for Civil Rights and acquiring several programs run by the Department of Labor. Department officials said they have since abandoned the civil rights proposals, which were sure to be the most controversial part of the plan. They said the plan remained in flux. It was created last fall to comply with President Trump\u2019s executive order to curb the reach of federal agencies and cut duplication and inefficiency. Liz Hill, the Education Department spokeswoman, said that it was \u201cabsolutely not true\u201d that the department intentionally withheld details from Congress, and that \u201cno final determinations have been made and therefore there is nothing to present.\u201d \u201cThe deliberative reorganization document is just that \u2014 a deliberative document not in final form,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are following normal protocols for department reorganization.\u201d Though the plan presents a long-term vision, through 2022, some of its contents were presented in a 14-page presentation to employees in February shortly after the department\u2019s budget requests were released. And last week, the department announced it would reassign its budget director, the first move toward disbanding the budget office. The decision was made over the opposition of the White House\u2019s Office of Management and Budget, according to Politico. Several other staff changes were announced for 2019. Some department employees denounced the move as an effort to dismantle an agency that would provide a critical check on the department\u2019s overhaul plans, but other experts said it made sense. \u201cBudget offices, because they have so much power and institutional knowledge, can be seen as obstacles by reform-minded government leaders,\u201d said Andy Smarick, a fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. \u201cMany new government officials think they\u2019ll only have to fight policy battles, when in fact there are lots of ways, including in the budget process, for their efforts to get scuttled.\u201d The plan aligns with measures Ms. DeVos has taken to shrink her agency, which she has described as bloated. She has shed hundreds of regulations, and hundreds of staff through attrition and buyouts. For the most part, Ms. DeVos\u2019s restructuring plan involves consolidating offices, such as merging the office that oversees charter and private schools with the main office that oversees elementary and secondary education in public schools. The plan would eliminate the Office of the Under Secretary, a position that has helped shape higher education policy, and create a new Office of Lifelong Learning. It would also reduce the number of political appointees. The proposal also seeks to acquire several programs run by the Department of Labor. The department proposed to take over adult and unemployed worker programs run by the Labor Department, and to redirect the funding for those programs to federal Pell grants so that unemployed workers can enroll in higher education and vocational programs. The department would acquire an \u201cout-of-school youth\u201d program from the Labor Department, as well as a program that helps reintegrate ex-prisoners. Details of the plan surfaced amid a bitter contract dispute between the DeVos administration and the union that represents the department\u2019s 3,900 employees. Union leaders believe the contract gutted all protections that would allow its members to defend themselves in the department\u2019s overhaul. Most notably, the contract cuts down the use of \u201cofficial time,\u201d which employees could use to do union activities, a benefit Congress extended 40 years ago, and instead requires that representatives take unpaid leave for such activities with permission from their supervisors. The goal of the collective bargaining agreement, Ms. Hill said, \u201cis to treat all employees and the American taxpayers fairly.\u201d Union officials say the agreement also stripped out previously negotiated provisions for pay increases and promotions, performance evaluations, work schedules, child care and overtime. It also limits the issues that can be brought up as a grievance and eliminates a guarantee against retaliation for filing one. \u201cThis agency contends that their mission is so very important, but how can it be when they\u2019re creating a hostile work environment, where employees are coming and going and worried about what\u2019s going to happen to them on a daily basis?\u201d said Sharon Harris, executive vice president of the American Federation of Government Employees Council 252, which represents Education Department employees. The union said the agreement came \u201cafter months of anti-union proposals and hostile behavior at the table,\u201d which concluded with the department\u2019s bargaining team effectively walking away from negotiations before they even started. The department said the union failed to negotiate in good faith, ignoring multiple invitations to resolve the impasse and blowing multiple deadlines to submit counteroffers. The department imposed its final offer. The fight speaks to a larger theme at the department, the employee wrote to congressional staffers. \u201cThings have gotten pretty awful here,\u201d said the email from the Education Department official, which noted that the department would start requiring screening of all communication with Congress. \u201cAnd at this point, employees are willing to accept whatever fallout comes with exercising a right to make sure Congress gets information it needs. Employees are tired of seeing their colleagues deputized into misleading Congress.\u201d",

      "content": " Education Secretary Betsy DeVos unveiled a highly anticipated overhaul on Friday of the rules governing campus sexual assault, reducing the liability of colleges and universities for investigating sexual misconduct claims and bolstering the due process rights of defendants, including the right to cross-examine their accusers. The rules would be the first regulations to govern how schools should meet their legal obligations under Title IX, the 1972 law prohibiting sex discrimination in educational programs that receive federal funding. The regulations will now face a 60-day public comment period before they are final. The regulations mirror a draft proposal first reported by The New York Times in August, which established a narrower definition of sexual harassment, tightened reporting requirements, relieved colleges of the responsibility to investigate off-campus episodes, and outlined steps schools should take to provide support for accusers. They also give schools the flexibility to choose a higher evidentiary standard, establish an appeals process, and offer the option of cross-examination. \u201cEvery survivor of sexual violence must be taken seriously, and every student accused of sexual misconduct must know that guilt is not predetermined,\u201d Ms. DeVos said in a statement announcing the regulations. \u201cWe can, and must, condemn sexual violence and punish those who perpetrate it, while ensuring a fair grievance process. Those are not mutually exclusive ideas.\u201d Victims\u2019 rights advocates and Obama administration officials denounced what they saw as an overly aggressive rollback of the steps taken by the previous administration to combat sexual assault on campus. \u201cWe brought this hidden violence into the public eye, and we saw schools change their practices as a result,\u201d former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said in a statement. \u201cThese protections made students safer and gave parents peace of mind. Today\u2019s proposed rollback would return us to the days when schools swept rape and assault under the rug and survivors were shamed into silence.\u201d The most significant changes outlined in the final proposal include procedural mandates that underscore Ms. DeVos\u2019s belief that the system shaped by the Obama administration lacks fairness, consistency and due process. The new rules codify procedures that would essentially turn college boardrooms into courtrooms when adjudicating sex assault disciplinary proceedings. Under the new rules, schools would be required to hold live hearings and would no longer rely on a so-called single investigator model that has become common at colleges. Accusers and students accused of sexual assault must be allowed to cross-examine each other through an adviser or lawyer. The rules require that the live hearings be conducted by a neutral decision maker and conducted with a presumption of innocence. Both parties would have equal access to all the evidence that school investigators use to determine facts of the case, and a chance to appeal decisions. Elementary and secondary schools, which are also bound by Title IX, would not have to hold live hearings. Though the rules were drafted over the last year, they were vetted in recent weeks by the White House and other administration agencies where emotions still ran hot over the fallout from the Supreme Court confirmation hearings for Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh. President Trump used due process arguments to rally conservatives when his Supreme Court nominee faced allegations of sexual assault, including an episode said to have occurred at Yale. Justice Kavanaugh was ultimately confirmed even after one accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, publicly aired her allegations before the Senate Judiciary Committee in a hearing that all sides considered painful. \u201cIf this proposed rule goes into effect, every single campus Title IX process is going to replicate what happened in the Senate Judiciary Committee against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford,\u201d said Jess Davidson, the interim executive director of End Rape on Campus. Victims\u2019 rights and due process advocates commended the department for including safeguards in the cross-examination requirement. The rules prohibit direct questioning of victims by the defendant, keeping in line with the Obama administration\u2019s recommendation; require cross-examination to occur through a third-party, such as an adviser or lawyer; and include a \u201crape shield\u201d protection that would keep a complainant\u2019s sexual history off limits. \u201cThere is no better way to test the truthfulness of an accusation than by questioning the accuser during a live hearing,\u201d said Justin Dillon, a partner at the Washington-based law firm KaiserDillon, who has represented dozens of accused students. \u201cIf colleges are going to adjudicate what are essentially crimes, then accused students deserve to have the tools to defend themselves effectively.\u201d But victims\u2019 advocates said the regulation undermined the intent of the sex discrimination law, which is to combat gender-specific discrimination and define sexual misconduct as a means of denying students access to an education. Several groups said they believed the rules were meant to decrease the number of Title IX investigations on campus and chill sexual assault and harassment reporting. In a summary of its proposal, the department said the rules sought \u201cto produce more reliable outcomes, thereby encouraging more students to turn to their schools for support in the wake of sexual harassment and reducing the risk of improperly punishing students.\u201d Legal experts say that the department appears to be aligning itself with the courts, where a wave of opinions in the last two years have weighed heavily on the side of accused students. K. C. Johnson, a history professor at Brooklyn College and the City University of New York, said he believed the Education Department sought to institutionalize a recent decision by a federal court. In that ruling, against the University of Michigan, the court said that universities must allow students or a representative to directly question their accusers in a live Title IX hearing. But Terry W. Hartle, a senior vice president of the American Council on Education, which represents college presidents, warned that while schools welcomed clarity from the Education Department on how to properly balance support for survivors and the rights of accused students, colleges and universities were ill-equipped to essentially conduct trials. \u201cColleges and universities are not courts, and these sort of proceedings would require us to legalize student disciplinary proceedings,\u201d Mr. Hartle said. \u201cWe lack the knowledge, the expertise, and credibility to do this.\u201d Last September, when Ms. DeVos announced that she would propose Title IX rules, she rescinded nonbinding Obama-era guidelines, which she said \u201cfailed too many students\u201d and coerced colleges into setting up \u201cquasi-legal structures.\u201d The Obama-era guidelines were hailed by victims\u2019 rights advocates for holding colleges accountable for properly addressing rising reports of sexual assault on campuses, but they were nonbinding. Particularly contentious was the encouragement of colleges to adopt a lower standard of evidence \u2014 \u201cpreponderance of evidence\u201d \u2014 in adjudicating cases. They also applied a broader definition of sexual harassment and maintained a longstanding standard that a school \u201creasonably should know\u201d of an episode in determining a school\u2019s liability for failing to investigate a complaint. The rules also required schools to investigate any claim of harassment, regardless of where it initially took place. The new rules would require that institutions only be held legally responsible for investigating formal complaints and responding to reports that school officials have \u201cactual knowledge\u201d of happening. A formal complaint is one made to \u201can official who has the authority to institute corrective measures.\u201d If a victim opts not to file a formal complaint, the rules encourage schools to provide \u201csupportive measures,\u201d without being penalized. The new rules would adopt a new Supreme Court definition of sexual harassment as \u201cunwelcome conduct on the basis of sex that is so severe, pervasive and objectively offensive that it denies a person access to the school\u2019s education program or activity.\u201d The rules also maintain that complaints must involve conduct that occurred in the school\u2019s own program or activity, though the department said that schools should look at factors like whether the harassment occurred at a location or under circumstances in which the school \u201cowned the premises or exercised oversight, supervision or discipline over the location or participants.\u201d The rules would also allow schools to choose the evidentiary standard \u2014 \u201cpreponderance of evidence\u201d or \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidence \u2014 to apply in determining whether accused students are responsible for alleged misconduct. In determining whether schools took the proper steps to address the allegations, the department would apply a standard called \u201cdeliberately indifferent,\u201d meaning that an institution would be in violation of the law \u201conly if its response to the sexual harassment is clearly unreasonable in light of known circumstances.\u201d",

GreenPRINT EDITIONPlan to Lift Federal Limits on For-Profit Colleges|July 27, 2018, Page A19",
      "author": "Erica L. Green",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Education Secretary Betsy DeVos plans to eliminate regulations that forced for-profit colleges to prove that they provide gainful employment to the students they enroll, in what would be the most drastic in a series of moves that she has made to free the for-profit sector from safeguards put in effect during the Obama era. The so-called gainful employment regulations put into force by the Obama administration cut off federally guaranteed student loans to colleges if their graduates did not earn enough money to pay them off. That sent many for-profit colleges and universities into an economic tailspin because so many of their alumni were failing to find decent jobs. The Obama regulations \u2014 years in the making and the subject of a bitter fight that pulled in heavy hitters from both parties who backed the for-profit schools \u2014 also required such schools to advertise whether or not they met federal standards for job placement in promotional materials and to prospective students. Now, a draft regulation, obtained by The New York Times, indicates that the Education Department plans to scuttle the regulations altogether, not simply modify them, as Ms. DeVos did Wednesday with new regulations that scaled back an Obama-era debt relief plan for student borrowers who felt duped by the unrealistic appeals of for-profit colleges. The move would punctuate a series of decisions to freeze, modify and now eliminate safeguards put in place after hundreds of for-profit colleges were accused of widespread fraud and subsequently collapsed, leaving their enrolled students with huge debts and no degrees. The failure of two mammoth chains, Corinthian Colleges and ITT Technical Institutes, capped years of complaints that some career-training colleges took advantage of veterans and other nontraditional students, using deceptive marketing and illegal recruitment practices. The draft \u201cgainful employment\u201d rule obtained by The Times is the most recent iteration of a proposal more than a year in the making from the Education Department, which as recently as last week had considered preserving at least some of the provisions in the Obama-era regulations, according to officials familiar with the department\u2019s plans. A final rule could look different, and the department plans to solicit public comment on the proposal. In the draft rule, the department proposes to hold institutions accountable by publishing information on a new federal database, or an existing government website called the College Scorecard. The sites would list student debt burdens, federal loan repayment rates, degree completion rates and the average post-college earnings of alumni, which the College Scorecard already does. The existing database, created under the Obama administration, includes such data for more than 7,000 institutions, but it does not include program-by-program success rates for such certificates as nursing assistance, cosmetology or auto maintenance, nor does it contain the detailed employment statistics that the gainful employment regulations targeted. The Education Department wrote in the draft rule that it planned to update the scorecard with information about specific programs for all colleges and universities that are eligible for federal financial aid, \u201cthus improving transparency and providing information to students to inform their enrollment decisions through a market-based accountability system.\u201d But it would eliminate the powerful threat to withhold access to guaranteed student loans from colleges whose graduates cannot find the work to pay them back. Few higher-education institutions could survive without federal student aid. \u201cThe gainful employment regulations were enacted to protect career college students from being trapped in programs where they incur mountains of debt for little or no benefit,\u201d said Aaron Ament, the president of the National Student Legal Defense Network. \u201cAny attempt to eliminate this common-sense rule is an enormous mistake that will cost students and American taxpayers dearly.\u201d Education Department officials did not respond to requests for comment on the draft rule. The DeVos approach would undo nearly a decade of efforts to create a tough accountability system for the largely unregulated and scandal-riddled for-profit sector of higher education. In recent years, large for-profit chains have collapsed under mountains of complaints and lawsuits for employing misleading and deceptive practices. The most high-profile chains, ITT Tech and Corinthian Colleges, generated tens of thousands of complaints from student borrowers who said they were left with worthless degrees. The Obama administration forgave at least $450 million in taxpayer-funded student debt. The Obama administration began drafting the regulations when the for-profit college sector was booming, with large chains enrolling 500,000 students at a time. That prompted intensive campaigns by the for-profit sector to kill the rule, dozens of hearings, more than 90,000 public comments and lawsuits. House Republicans targeted the regulation for elimination in their reauthorization of a new higher-education bill. And Republican Senate leaders \u2014 including Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee and the chairman of the education committee \u2014 have said that they believe that accountability measures should be applied to all schools, not just one sector. Ms. DeVos has tended to agree with critics and industry leaders who say that the Obama rules unfairly targeted for-profits. In statements, officials have maintained that Ms. DeVos is committed to \u201cweeding out bad actors and doing what\u2019s best for students, not capriciously targeting schools based on their tax status.\u201d Ms. DeVos has also stacked her top ranks with advisers from the sector, including Diane Auer Jones, a senior adviser on postsecondary education, whose ethics filings show that she lobbied against funding the rule while working for an operator of for-profit schools, Career Education Corporation. Ms. Jones has not recused herself from advising on the gainful employment rule or on any matters involving career education, according to her list of recusals provided to The Times in May. In an April letter, 10 congressional Democrats wrote to Ms. DeVos asking her to address Ms. Jones\u2019s apparent conflicts of interest. Ethics watchdogs have called also raised alarms about Ms. Jones\u2019s previous roles at for-profits, including the legal watchdog Democracy Forward, which revealed her lobbying activities to The Times. The Education Department has defended Ms. Jones\u2019s record, which includes working at community colleges and public universities. One of Ms. DeVos\u2019s first acts as secretary was delaying the main provisions of the Obama-era for-profit rules. In March 2017, she announced that colleges would have three more months to appeal gainful employment data that was released at the end of the Obama administration. She delayed the rules a second time, in June last year, about a month after announcing that she would renegotiate the gainful employment regulations. She delayed the disclosure provision again last month, giving institutions until July 2019 to comply. For-profit school leaders have praised the delays, as they have argued the rules were meant to put them out of business at the expense of students who enrolled in career education schools. When Ms. DeVos announced the first delay of the Obama rules last spring, Steve Gunderson, the president of Career Education Colleges and Universities, praised the decision. He said the group, which represents more than 1,000 for-profit schools, would present evidence to the department that the rules \u201ctreats identical programs differently.\u201d Last year, Ms. DeVos pointed to a court ruling in favor of scaling back after the American Association of Cosmetology Schools won a lawsuit against the Education Department. The association said the gainful employment rule unfairly penalized its members because the department\u2019s data did not capture all of their graduates\u2019 income, such as tips, that would skew earnings data. \u201cWe need to get this right for our students, and we need to get this right for our institutions of higher education,\u201d Ms. DeVos said at the time. \u201cOnce fully implemented, the current rules would unfairly and arbitrarily limit students\u2019 ability to pursue certain types of higher-education and career-training programs.\u201d In 2014, when the Obama administration announced gainful employment rules, it estimated that about 1,400 programs serving 840,000 students \u2014 of which 99 percent were at for-profit institutions \u2014 would not pass its new accountability standards. In January 2017, the department announced that about 800 programs, or 10 percent of those examined, had failed to meet the requirements; 98 percent of those were for-profits. An analysis of the programs, conducted by New America, shows that hundreds of programs that failed the federal test went on to shut their doors shortly after. Consumer protection advocates said that there is enough evidence to show that the gainful employment rule is meeting its goal of weeding out the poorest performers. \u201cIt took nearly a decade of rule making, litigation and public debate to write a gainful employment rule that protects hundreds of thousands of students from unaffordable debt,\u201d said James Kvaal, the president of the Institute for College Access & Success, who helped draft the rules as an Obama administration official. \u201cNow the Trump administration may just scrap these essential student protections. The evidence is in, and the gainful employment rule has helped students find better choices and forced colleges to improve the value of their career education programs.\u201d",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Education Secretary Betsy DeVos defended her agency\u2019s commitment to minority students in a wide-ranging hearing in which congressional leaders pressed Ms. DeVos on her department\u2019s budget. Ms. DeVos testified before the House Appropriations Committee, fielding questions on the Education Department\u2019s budget request for the fiscal year that begins in October. The request calls for a 5 percent spending cut, eliminates dozens of programs and pitches a $1 billion school choice proposal. \u201cWith this budget, we can continue to return power to those who walk side by side with students every day,\u201d Ms. DeVos said. \u201cBecause that\u2019s who budgets are for, not special interest, not legislators, not the system. This budget is about students.\u201d But Democratic lawmakers disagreed that the budget would benefit all students \u2014 especially minorities. Representative Barbara Lee, Democrat of California, called the budget a \u201cslap in the face\u201d for minority students. Ms. Lee seized on a proposed $1 million cut to the department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights, and its proposed cuts to after-school programs. The cuts, coupled with the Trump administration\u2019s decision to examine and possibly rescind guidance meant to protect minority students from racial discrimination in discipline and special education decisions, inflamed a debate about the department\u2019s approach to minority students. \u201cYour head is in the sand about racial bias and racial discrimination,\u201d Ms. Lee said, adding: \u201cYou just don\u2019t care about civil rights of black and brown children. This is horrible.\u201d Ms. DeVos said that she was \u201cvery proud of the record of the Office for Civil Rights,\u201d and that it had learned to do more with less, including resolving complaints faster. She said the office would continue to uphold laws preventing discrimination. She also said the budget preserved funding levels for poor students, and proposed school choice programs that could help minority and poor students get to better schools. \u201cI believe this budget does very much not only protect but encourage students of color to pursue their education,\u201d Ms. DeVos said. She also defended her agency\u2019s re-examination of guidance issued in 2014 that sought to curb racial disparities in school discipline. The department had been eyeing the guidance for months, but it recently became a target of congressional Republicans who linked it to discipline policies at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., where 17 people were killed in a mass shooting last month. \u201cThe stated goal of the guidance is one that we all embrace, and we are committed to reviewing and considering this guidance and taking appropriate steps,\u201d Ms. DeVos said. \u201cBut I have nothing to say at this point about where that is.\u201d Ms. DeVos will lead a school safety commission created by President Trump to review the guidance, among other factors believed to contribute to school shootings. On Tuesday, Ms. DeVos said the commission would comprise the heads of the Departments of Health and Human Services, Homeland Security and Justice. It will meet in the next couple of weeks and hold forums with experts across the country. Ms. DeVos stopped short of relating any gun-control measure to school safety, but said she was not a member of the National Rifle Association. Ms. DeVos said a driving force behind the budget plan was an order from Mr. Trump to agency leaders to \u201cspend taxpayer dollars efficiently.\u201d The directive has not only resulted in a trimmer budget, but also an overhaul of Ms. DeVos\u2019s department that drew questions from the Appropriations Committee. One week before Ms. DeVos was to go before the committee, a career staff member in the Education Department emailed members of the panel alleging that the agency was withholding information about a departmental overhaul from its budget justifications. The email was obtained by The New York Times. \u201cOur concern is about a breakdown in communication, a culture of secrecy and a fear of retaliatory action that has prevented Budget Service from providing House and Senate appropriators and staff, and for that matter, the public, with key information about the department\u2019s plans for fiscal year 2019,\u201d the email said. \u201cGiven the potential for some of these proposals to radically impact the way the department carries out its mission, Congress should probably see this.\u201d Liz Hill, the Education Department spokeswoman, said that it was \u201cabsolutely not true\u201d that the department intentionally withheld details from Congress, and that \u201cno final determinations have been made and therefore there is nothing to present.\u201d \u201cThe deliberative reorganization document is just that \u2014 a deliberative document not in final form,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are following normal protocols for department reorganization.\u201d While it is not abnormal for education secretaries to reorganize the department, and not many decisions require congressional approval, it is also customary for the department to share details with key committees. In the email, the staff member leaked a reorganization plan that included a consolidation of a number of administrative offices, cutting the number of regional offices in the Office for Civil Rights and acquiring several programs run by the Labor Department. Education Department officials said they had since abandoned the civil rights proposals, which were sure to be the most protested part of the proposal. They said the plan remained in flux. It was created last fall to comply with Mr. Trump\u2019s executive order to curb the reach of federal agencies and cut duplication and inefficiency. Though the plan lays out a long-term vision, through 2022, some of its contents were displayed in a 14-page presentation to employees in February. And last week, the department announced it would reassign its budget director, the first move toward restructuring the budget office to reassign staff members elsewhere in the department. The decision, which officials said was meant to help spread expertise across the department, was made over the opposition of the White House\u2019s Office of Management and Budget, according to Politico. Several other staff changes were announced for 2019. Representative Rosa DeLauro, a Connecticut Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, told Ms. DeVos on Tuesday that she was disheartened to hear the plans for the budget office, which she said was central to managing the department\u2019s programs and resources. Ms. DeLauro also said the shuffle, along with limited communication from department staff members, \u201cdirectly impugns on the critical work of this committee, and it needs to stop.\u201d Representative Rodney Frelinghuysen, Republican of New Jersey and the chairman of the committee, said he was concerned about \u201ca disconnect\u201d between Ms. DeVos\u2019s administration and his office. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe that people who have been on the job for this long don\u2019t have staff that understand how the system works,\u201d Mr. Frelinghuysen said. \u201cIt is important to connect with the people who pay the bills.\u201d The plan aligns with measures Ms. DeVos has taken to shrink her agency, which she has described as bloated. She has shed hundreds of regulations, and hundreds of staff members through attrition and voluntary buyouts. For the most part, Ms. DeVos\u2019s restructuring plan involves consolidating offices, such as merging the office that oversees charter and private schools with the main office that oversees elementary and secondary education in public schools. The plan would eliminate the Office of the Under Secretary, a position that has helped shape higher education policy, and create an Office of Lifelong Learning. It would also reduce the number of political appointees. The proposal also seeks to acquire several programs run by the Labor Department, including ones that connect unemployed adults and former prisoners with educational services. Details of the plan surfaced amid a bitter contract dispute between the DeVos administration and the union that represents the department\u2019s 3,900 employees. Union leaders believe the contract gutted protections that would allow its members to defend themselves in the department\u2019s overhaul. Union officials say the agreement also stripped out previously negotiated provisions for pay increases and promotions, performance evaluations, work schedules, child care and overtime. It also limits the issues that can be brought up as grievances and eliminates a guarantee against retaliation for filing one. The contract also cuts down the use of \u201cofficial time,\u201d which employees could use to participate in union activities, a benefit Congress extended 40 years ago, and instead requires that representatives take unpaid leave for such activities with permission from their supervisors. The union said the agreement came \u201cafter months of anti-union proposals and hostile behavior at the table,\u201d which concluded with the department\u2019s bargaining team effectively walking away from negotiations before they even started. The department said that the union \u201cspent more than a year dragging its feet,\u201d and that its team failed to negotiate in good faith, ignored multiple invitations to resolve the impasse and blew multiple deadlines to submit counteroffers. The department put its final offer in place.",

WASHINGTON \u2014 The Education Department is considering whether to allow states to use federal funding to purchase guns for educators, according to multiple people with knowledge of the plan. Such a move appears to be unprecedented, reversing a longstanding position taken by the federal government that it should not pay to outfit schools with weapons. And it would also undermine efforts by Congress to restrict the use of federal funding on guns. As recently as March, Congress passed a school safety bill that allocated $50 million a year to local school districts, but expressly prohibited the use of the money for firearms. But the department is eyeing a program in federal education law, the Student Support and Academic Enrichment grants, that makes no mention of prohibiting weapons purchases. That omission would allow the education secretary, Betsy DeVos, to use her discretion to approve any state or district plans to use grant funding for firearms and firearm training, unless Congress clarifies the law or bans such funding through legislative action. \u201cThe department is constantly considering and evaluating policy issues, particularly issues related to school safety,\u201d said Liz Hill, a spokeswoman for the Education Department. \u201cThe secretary nor the department issues opinions on hypothetical scenarios.\u201d The $1 billion student support program, part of the Every Student Succeeds Act, is intended for academic and enrichment opportunities in the country\u2019s poorest schools and calls for school districts to use the money toward three goals: providing a well-rounded education, improving school conditions for learning and improving the use of technology for digital literacy. Department officials acknowledged that should the Education Department carry out the proposal, it would appear to be the first time that a federal agency has authorized the purchase of weapons without a congressional mandate, according to people familiar with the discussions. And while no such restrictions exist in the federal education law, it could undermine the grant program\u2019s adoption of \u201cdrug and violence prevention,\u201d which defines a safe school environment as free of weapons. In its research, the Education Department has determined that the gun purchases could fall under improving school conditions, people familiar with the department\u2019s thinking said. Under the current guidelines for that part of the grant, the department encourages schools to increase access to mental health counseling, establish dropout prevention programs, reduce suspensions and expulsions and improve re-entry programs for students transitioning from the juvenile justice system. But the department began exploring whether to expand the use of the support grants after the school shootings in Parkland, Fla., and Santa Fe, Tex., prompted states to inquire about alternatives. Department officials were considering whether to issue guidance on the funding before the start of the new school year, but have been weighing the political and legal ramifications, according to people familiar with the discussions. The proposal by the Education Department is almost certain to spur backlash. The Trump administration\u2019s call to arm educators in an effort to prevent school shootings has faced overwhelming criticism from educators, lawmakers and law enforcement officials. The measure would also break from decades-old practice in how funding is doled out for the purposes of school security. Guidance for grants distributed by the Homeland Security Department that are intended for \u201cschool preparedness,\u201d for example, notes that weapons and ammunition are not permitted. And after the Parkland shooting, Congress added a rule prohibiting the use of grants for firearms or firearm training in the Stop School Violence Act, under which the Justice Department will grant funds to school districts. In weighing the proposal, the Education Department has also taken into account that school shootings were not a consideration when Congress passed the Every Student Succeeds Act in 2015, according to people familiar with the discussions. Three of the remaining architects of the law \u2014 Representative Robert C. Scott, Democrat of Virginia, and Senators Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, and Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington State \u2014 have all opposed the idea of arming teachers. The student support grant was created from funds from other programs that were collapsed in the Every Student Succeeds Act that addressed issues like mental health, violence prevention, bullying and harassment. The Trump administration has twice moved to eliminate the grant program from its budget. But as Congress drafted a spending bill in the months after the Parkland shooting, advocates pointed to the program as emblematic of a successful approach to school safety. Congress instead increased funding for the grants by $700 million in the bill passed this year. After the Parkland shooting, the Trump administration convened a federal commission on school safety, led by Ms. DeVos, to examine topics like mental and behavioral health resources, building security and the role of law enforcement in schools. The commission has held several public hearings where educators and advocates from across the country have asked for expanded support staff and services, including school counselors, and additional security measures. Members of the commission have also visited school districts, like in rural Arkansas, where armed employees can be found at schools in areas not easily reached by law enforcement. The commission plans to issue recommendations by the end of the year. In June, Ms. DeVos said the commission would not consider the role of guns in school shootings, but she later indicated that the panel would look narrowly at specific issues, including age limits for firearm purchases. Last month, Ms. DeVos\u2019s assistant secretary for the office of elementary and secondary education, Jason Botel, reiterated that point in a congressional hearing. That prompted Representative Donald M. Payne Jr., Democrat of New Jersey, to question the Education Department. In a letter to Mr. Botel, he asked if the department was planning to arm teachers. But the department issued a statement saying that it did not plan to do so because \u201cthis is a function appropriately reserved for the states.\u201d",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 The majority of states now have the green light from Education Secretary Betsy DeVos to begin implementing a sweeping federal law passed in 2015 to replace the much-maligned No Child Left Behind law. But state and federal education policymakers are running into a surprising source of opposition: governors. Ms. DeVos has approved 35 plans, including those from Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C., that provide a road map for complying with the federal Every Student Succeeds Act, a bipartisan law passed under President Barack Obama that returns the reins of education reform to states. The law required every state education department to submit a plan. Of those 35, six are from states where the governor refused to sign on: Maryland, Georgia, Wisconsin, Missouri, Louisiana and New York. Three others that did not get a governor\u2019s endorsement \u2014 those from Nebraska, Oklahoma and Kentucky \u2014 are pending approval. Of the nine disputed plans, seven are opposed by Republican governors. The governors have publicly protested their states\u2019 goals, deeming them underwhelming at best and at worst unjust. In many cases, the governors invoked some of the harsh language that Ms. DeVos herself had used to denounce school districts that they said trapped students in failing schools. Yet they have received little support from a secretary who would seem to be a natural ally. Georgia\u2019s Republican governor, Nathan Deal, said his state\u2019s plan \u201cdoes not take full advantage of the opportunities for flexibility and innovation, nor does it set adequately high expectations for Georgia\u2019s students.\u201d In Wisconsin, Gov. Scott Walker, another Republican, said the state\u2019s plans for improving failing schools amounted to little more than \u201cbureaucratic paperwork\u201d and \u201cdoes little to challenge the status quo.\u201d In perhaps the most contentious case, Maryland\u2019s moderate Republican governor, Larry Hogan, is engaged in a bitter battle with the Democrat-controlled Legislature over the state\u2019s education goals, which a spokesman called \u201ca farce.\u201d As Maryland was compiling its plan, the Legislature passed a bill to limit strategies championed by the governor that would allow state leaders to implement major changes for persistently low-performing schools. The Legislature was seeking to protect against what lawmakers saw as privatization efforts, such as expanding charter schools and vouchers \u2014 what a teachers union called the \u201cDeVos playbook.\u201d In a letter to Ms. DeVos, Mr. Hogan wrote that he could not support his own state\u2019s plan given the \u201cimpossible circumstances\u201d that the Legislature had imposed. \u201cThe governor\u2019s not going to put his name on something that he doesn\u2019t think actually helps students,\u201d said Douglass V. Mayer, a spokesman for Mr. Hogan. \u201cIt\u2019s frankly disgusting.\u201d While governors\u2019 signatures were not required for approval, Congress went to great lengths to identify the state executives as key stakeholders in the next wave of education reform. Not only did they get their own signature box, but governors were mentioned 23 times in the law, which calls for plans to be assembled with \u201ctimely and meaningful consultation with the governor.\u201d The bill was the first to be endorsed by the National Governors Association since the welfare overhaul of 1996. The organization, which has helped governors navigate their new role in the law, said the small group of governors who withheld their signatures illustrates the larger tension around the transfer back to local control. \u201cIt\u2019s such a fundamental shift that it\u2019s actually going as well as it can,\u201d said Anna Davis, the director of government relations at the National Governors Association. \u201cGovernors feel now more accountable. It\u2019s an exciting time.\u201d Federal Education Department officials said the governors\u2019 protests did not factor into the decisions about whether to approve state plans. \u201cUnder E.S.S.A., the secretary\u2019s job is to ensure that state plans comply with the law, not to provide her opinion on the state\u2019s approach,\u201d said Liz Hill, a spokeswoman for the Education Department. \u201cShe hopes that these plans will be seen not as a ceiling but as a foundation upon which states can improve education for all students.\u201d Before signing the law in December 2015, Mr. Obama called it a \u201cChristmas miracle\u201d because it had achieved the tricky task of allowing state flexibility within a federal framework. It replaced the top-heavy No Child Left Behind Act from the George W. Bush era. That law had become unpopular because of its emphasis on testing and prescriptive mandates, though it is still widely praised for unmasking the nation\u2019s achievement gaps, particularly for black, poor and special education students. Ms. DeVos has drawn criticism from both parties for her department\u2019s approach to the new law, particularly from its chief architects, Senators Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, and Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington. Ms. Murray has criticized Ms. DeVos as a rubber stamp for plans that fail to execute the law\u2019s intent to hold schools accountable for struggling students, even while Mr. Alexander balked at what he saw as the Education Department\u2019s heavy hand in attempting to enforce the new law. In Maryland, the law has become a political football. The heavily Democratic state has a Republican governor, powerful teachers unions and a high-profile, low-performing school district, Baltimore, that holds the bulk of the state\u2019s charter schools. Citing the new law\u2019s charge for governors to be involved in education planning, Mr. Hogan submitted to the State Board of Education several suggestions for overhauling schools performing in the bottom 5 percent, such as creating separate school districts, expanding charter schools run by private companies and increasing funding for a state voucher program for private schools. Shortly thereafter, a bill emerged in the Maryland General Assembly, the Protect Our Schools Act, that banned every intervention the governor had suggested. The bill also said academic indicators such as test scores could account for no more than 65 percent of a school\u2019s performance rating, among the lowest percentages proposed in the country. Mr. Hogan vetoed the bill, but the Legislature overrode his veto. Mr. Hogan plans to back legislation seeking to reverse the bill\u2019s provisions. The Maryland State Education Association, the union that represents most Maryland teachers, was among the major champions of the legislation. Union officials praise the state\u2019s plan as a step in the right direction and away from the \u201ctest-and-punish\u201d culture of No Child Left Behind. Limiting the weight of academic standards reflects the reality that there is more than one way to gauge the success of a school, they said. Cheryl Bost, the vice president of the state union, said it was \u201cunfortunate\u201d that the governor chose not to sign the state plan. \u201cIt also signals he has prioritized vouchers, takeover districts, for-profit charters over the value of public education in Maryland,\u201d she said. The state school board, which includes several appointees of the governor, echoed Mr. Hogan\u2019s concerns about the legislation, which, the board wrote, \u201cdramatically de-prioritizes student achievement.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s understandable why the governor didn\u2019t sign off,\u201d said Andy Smarick, the president of the board. \u201cIf anything, his action helps keep alive the serious debate about how best to serve kids.\u201d While the state plan does call for identifying consistently low-performing schools for \u201ctargeted support,\u201d such as staffing changes and resource reallocation, it is scant on details for what happens if a school fails to improve after a number of years. In the section of the response that calls for outlining what steps it would take if a significant number of schools continued to fail to make improvements, the state replied \u201cN/A.\u201d",

GreenPRINT EDITIONCharter School With Big Donors Reflects Education Divide|June 15, 2017, Page A11",

      "content": " GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. \u2014 Julia Stevenson scurried through the hallway as her school day came to a close, hoping to take advantage of as much daylight as possible to complete one of the last assignments of her high school career. \u201cI\u2019m flying home today,\u201d Ms. Stevenson, 18, said with a broad smile, explaining that she was hoping for clear skies and a beautiful view of Lake Michigan on the 300-mile round trip from Gerald R. Ford International Airport to her hometown, Traverse City, Mich. With her pilot\u2019s license in sight, Ms. Stevenson was about to graduate from the West Michigan Aviation Academy, a public charter school here founded by Dick DeVos, the billionaire husband of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. Ms. DeVos has called it an inspiration for her dogged support for school choice, a shining example of what is possible when schools are able to meet students\u2019 unique interests and needs. On Tuesday, she told thousands of charter school advocates that her husband\u2019s school prepared students \u201cto contribute in significant ways to our 21st-century economy.\u201d But with its deep-pocketed founder, corporate sponsors and remarkable capacity to raise money, the Aviation Academy may be more an example of what education can achieve with seemingly limitless funds than a model for other schools. Like the neighborhood public schools of Grand Rapids, the academy, on the grounds of Gerald Ford Airport, receives $7,500 per student in state funding. This helps pay for its rigorous science, technology, engineering and mathematics, or STEM, curriculum and its faculty, including the four flight instructors on staff. But it does not pay for the school\u2019s two airplanes; many of its science, engineering and mathematics facilities; or its distinction as the only school in the country that offers flight instruction as part of the curriculum. Students can graduate and fly a plane before they can rent a car or legally have a beer. How? The DeVoses alone have given more than $4 million to the school. Mr. DeVos donated an airplane from his private collection. Delta Air Lines donated another. \u201cThe concept is good. I just wish a public school would\u2019ve thought of starting that rather than have it be a charter,\u201d said Mary Bouwense, president of the Grand Rapids teachers union. \u201cBut I guess we wouldn\u2019t have been able to afford it. You have to have a boatload of money to start a school at the airport.\u201d The school, publicly funded and privately operated, is representative of the tensions in the school choice movement that have grown under the Trump administration. Ms. DeVos and Mr. Trump are proposing to increase funding for public charters, which serve more than three million students nationwide, by $168 million, or 50 percent, while cutting total education funding by $9 billion, much of which would come from programs primarily for traditional public schools. While charter schools have long had bipartisan support \u2014 they have been championed by every president since Bill Clinton \u2014 the movement finds itself at a crossroads. Charter school advocates have long said they support traditional public education as well, but the Trump budget has presented them with something of a choice: us or them. \u201cThe president has given a big hug to charter schools at the same time he\u2019s slapped down other education priorities,\u201d Nina Rees, president and chief executive of the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools, told a gathering of more than 4,000 charter leaders and advocates this week. \u201cAll of us need to understand that accepting the president\u2019s support for charter schools doesn\u2019t tie us to his whole agenda.\u201d The Aviation Academy has been at the center of similar debates in Michigan. The DeVoses backed the state\u2019s first charter legislation, passed in 1993, and their support for expanding charter schools has been seen as a direct threat to public schools, particularly vulnerable ones in cities like Detroit. On Tuesday, Ms. DeVos praised charter schools for proving that \u201cquality and choice can coexist,\u201d but said they \u201care not the one cure-all to the ills that beset education.\u201d Ms. DeVos encouraged her husband to start the school after he lost a run for Michigan\u2019s governorship in 2006. It would combine two of his passions: education and flying. Since then, the academy has attracted a diverse pool of 600 students via lottery. One of the recipients of its C.E.O. award this year was a refugee who enrolled in ninth grade speaking only Swahili. It outperformed traditional schools on state tests this year and has a four-year graduation rate of 85 percent. Students shoulder some costs, like extra blue polo shirts for their uniforms, insurance for Chromebooks and a fee for flight instruction. But the school primarily supports its aviation program with fund-raisers, including an annual banquet, which have drawn guests of honor such as former President George W. Bush. The DeVos name \u201cdoesn\u2019t hurt,\u201d said the school\u2019s chief executive, Patrick J. Cwayna, a former Grand Rapids public school principal whom Mr. DeVos selected to run the academy. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t we use their positive influence to bring advantages to our kids?\u201d Mr. Cwayna asked. Ms. Stevenson hopes that does not change. She has wanted to be a pilot since age 6 and never imagined that she would be able to take her family flying to celebrate her graduation. To attend the Aviation Academy, she has lived with family friends since she was a sophomore, one of a number of students who come from miles away. While Ms. DeVos has no direct role in running the school, Ms. Stevenson said it had become a target of critics since she became secretary of education. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of politics to it, but for me, personally, it\u2019s been an awesome opportunity that I\u2019ve been able to take advantage of,\u201d Ms. Stevenson said. \u201cI don\u2019t see why that\u2019s a negative thing. We\u2019re just a bunch of kids pursuing our dreams.\u201d The school started with 80 students in a renovated conference room at the airport, and has since tripled its population and nearly doubled its size. Its student body is 34 percent non-Caucasian and 10 percent special education, and this year, it drew 282 applications for 155 spots, including two applicants in their 30s. Mr. Cwayna said Mr. DeVos did not push his political or policy views on the school\u2019s leadership. He has made only two requests based on personal preference: that it not call the parent group \u201cthe PTA\u201d and that the men wear gray pants, a light blue shirt, dark blue blazers and one of three ties. Mr. DeVos is currently guiding the school through another expansion. At a recent board meeting that he led, members mulled over plans to add new facilities, including an airplane hangar, commons and classrooms. Mr. DeVos smiled often but said little. Then he was presented with the growing number of students on the waiting list. \u201cWell,\u201d he said. \u201cWaiting lists always bring mixed feelings.\u201d",

      "author": "Erica L. Green",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 The last face-to-face meeting between Representative Robert C. Scott and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos ended in an awkward cliffhanger. At a hearing last May of the House Education Committee, Mr. Scott, Democrat of Virginia, challenged the secretary\u2019s assertion that she was holding states accountable for achievement gaps between white and minority students as required by a new federal education law, the Every Student Succeeds Act. Mr. Scott, unconvinced, asked more pointedly: How can you assure us that you are following the law if you do not even make states calculate the performance of the different student groups we want to measure? Ms. DeVos dodged the question. Mr. Scott is now the chairman of the committee, and he is not taking silence or evasion for an answer. With control of the House and Senate divided, and President Trump in charge of the executive branch, the prospects for the House Democrats\u2019 legislative agenda for education may be limited, but their appetite for oversight of the Education Department appears limitless. \u201cOne of the problems we had in the minority is we asked a lot of questions that have not been answered,\u201d Mr. Scott said in an interview. \u201cNow that we\u2019re in the majority, we can ask the same questions with the expectation that we\u2019ll get an answer.\u201d On Tuesday, Mr. Scott added to a pile of inquiries stacking up at the department, this time questioning a recent move to replace the Education Department\u2019s acting inspector general, who is investigating Ms. DeVos\u2019s decision to reinstate a troubled accreditor of for-profit colleges and universities. Among other answers he is still waiting for is Ms. DeVos\u2019s justifications for rescinding policies meant to protect black students from being disproportionately suspended and placed in special education and student borrowers from predatory lenders and higher-education diploma mills. Mr. Scott said he is not itching to haul Ms. DeVos and her staff to Capitol Hill hearings to get the answers. \u201cTheater doesn\u2019t advance anybody\u2019s agenda,\u201d Mr. Scott said. \u201cI\u2019m interested in what research and evidence they used to come to these conclusions.\u201d Under the leadership of Representative Virginia Foxx, Republican of North Carolina, the committee passed laws strengthening career and technical education as well as juvenile justice programs. She also proposed an aggressive higher-education bill that gutted regulatory requirements and championed work force training programs. She called on Ms. DeVos to testify only once. Ms. Foxx said she hoped the committee would maintain its bipartisan spirit. \u201cIt\u2019s my hope that we exercise our oversight responsibilities by asking the right questions for the right reasons to ensure faithful execution of the laws we\u2019ve written,\u201d she said. Mr. Scott, the first African-American man elected to Congress from Virginia since the 1890s and the third to lead the Education Committee, has outlined a wide-ranging oversight agenda for the committee. Among the issues it plans to examine: the carrying out of the Every Student Succeeds Act and the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act; recommendations from the Federal Commission on School Safety led by Ms. DeVos in response to the mass school shooting last year in Parkland, Fla.; and the department\u2019s role in the rebuilding of schools in Puerto Rico, in the Virgin Islands and in other areas affected by disasters. In the higher-education sector, the committee also plans to scrutinize the department\u2019s administration of financial aid programs. Mr. Scott plans to champion bills that would pump $100 billion into public school infrastructure, limit the use of restraint and seclusion practices of special-education students and increase low-income and minority students\u2019 access to a four-year college or university. But when it comes to oversight, \u201cjust asking the questions usually gets people to act,\u201d he said. That approach has gotten results. A recent move by the White House to replace the Education Department\u2019s acting inspector general, Sandra Bruce, was reversed shortly after Mr. Scott, joined by other Democratic leaders, sent a letter to Ms. DeVos questioning the decision. The move, first reported by Politico, revealed the partnership developing between Mr. Scott and Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform. Mr. Cummings said in a statement that he plans to scrutinize \u201ccountless decisions that have negatively impacted students across the country, including dismantling protections against predatory for-profit lenders.\u201d In the letter on Tuesday, Mr. Scott and Mr. Cummings posed a second round of questions to the Education Department about perceived attempts to intervene in the inspector general\u2019s investigation into the secretary\u2019s reinstatement of the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools. The accreditor\u2019s recognition was revoked by the Obama administration in 2016 after the collapse of two for-profit chains, ITT Tech and Corinthian Colleges, and a history of failing to comply with federal rules. Ms. DeVos reinstated the agency last year after a judge found that the Obama administration\u2019s decision was \u201carbitrary and capricious.\u201d According to the Democrats\u2019 letter, Ms. DeVos\u2019s deputy secretary, Mick Zais, wrote to Ms. Bruce in the weeks before her replacement and asked that any investigation of the accreditor include a review of the Obama administration\u2019s actions. \u201cWe are concerned that these actions by the Deputy Secretary represent a clear attempt to violate the statutory independence of the OIG,\u201d the Democrats wrote, referring to the Office of Inspector General. Liz Hill, a spokeswoman for the Education Department, said the department \u201cwould never seek to undermine the independence of the inspector general.\u201d \u201cFor anyone to state otherwise is doing so with no basis in fact and purely for political gain,\u201d she said. Ms. Hill said the Education Department \u201chas been and will continue to be responsive to information requests from Congress,\u201d and that Ms. DeVos has an open invitation to meet one on one with members of both parties. \u201cThe secretary will continue to work with lawmakers who share the goal of rethinking education in order to improve opportunities for all students, expand K-12 education options and ensure students have a multitude of pathways to success post-high school,\u201d she said. Ms. DeVos has some ground to make up with Democrats. According to an analysis of Ms. DeVos\u2019s calendar by Education Week, she had more than 130 meetings or phone calls with Republican lawmakers or their top aides in the first year and a half of her tenure compared with about a dozen with Democrats. Representative Rosa DeLauro, Democrat of Connecticut, who will lead the appropriations subcommittee that funds education, said Ms. DeVos is one of the few cabinet secretaries she has not met with. \u201cThey\u2019re hell bent to do what they want to do, and think we don\u2019t count for anything,\u201d she said. Ms. DeLauro, who has clashed publicly with Ms. DeVos, said she plans to \u201chold the secretary accountable for the hollowing out of the Education Department\u201d through staffing and program cuts. She said she will fight recurring proposals to create a $1 billion program to finance vouchers for private and parochial school tuition, cutting after-school programs for low-income students and zeroing out funding for teacher training. Instead, Ms. DeLauro said she wants to champion new investments like community schools and early childhood education. \u201cI believe that, overall, the mission of the Department of Education these days is to privatize public education, and I want to block them,\u201d she said. \u201cOn the other hand, I view this as my opportunity to look at how we can provide new opportunities for new people.\u201d Representative Mark Takano of California, the chairman of the House Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs, said he will scrutinize how Ms. DeVos\u2019s proposals to deregulate for-profit colleges could allow for abuses of the G.I. Bill, which provides veterans with tuition assistance for higher education. He recently told a group of college accreditors, \u201cI promise to continue to do my part to crack down on predatory institutions.\u201d When the Democrats took the House, Michael J. Petrilli, the president of the conservative Thomas B. Fordham Institute, urged Ms. DeVos to step down rather than subject herself to \u201cshow trials.\u201d Now that Ms. DeVos has shown no signs of resigning, Mr. Petrilli anticipates that Democrats will discover they have limited power and the department will carry on, immune to bad press. \u201cThis is a department that doesn\u2019t have much to lose,\u201d he said.",

GreenPRINT EDITIONDeVos, Tired of Stalled Congress, Is Clearing a Path for Changes|June 1, 2018, Page A15",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 The top Republican on the Senate Education Committee effectively killed on Thursday all hope for a highly anticipated overhaul this year of the law governing the nation\u2019s 4,000 colleges and universities, paving the way for Education Secretary Betsy DeVos to wield her deregulatory power. The committee chairman, Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, said at a New York Times education conference in New York that the Senate would not produce promised higher education legislation this year, and blamed Democrats for the delay. \u201cThe Democrats won\u2019t do it,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cThey want to wait until next year to see if they\u2019re in better shape politically, but I keep telling them, \u2018I can take notes and do to you what you did to me, even if I\u2019m in the minority.\u2019\u201d Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the committee\u2019s ranking Democrat, has said repeatedly that her party is not the problem. Ms. Murray, a spokeswoman said, \u201chas made it clear that she wants to reauthorize the Higher Education Act as soon as possible to address the rising costs of college, increase access to underrepresented students, hold schools accountable for student success, and ensure every student is safe and free from discrimination on campus.\u201d The statement added, \u201cShe\u2019s at the table and ready to keep working, and hopefully Republican leaders haven\u2019t added this to the list of other bipartisan work they have given up on for the year.\u201d The roadblocks to an overhaul do not stop in the Senate. A conservative rewrite of the decades-old Higher Education Act has passed the House Education Committee, but the panel\u2019s chairwoman, Virginia Foxx of North Carolina, has not gotten a vote on the House floor. Her version, which would remove constraints on for-profit and religious institutions, cannot pass the Senate, where the Republicans hold a one-seat majority. With lawmakers at loggerheads, Ms. DeVos has made it clear that she is not waiting for Congress. She has announced a sweeping regulatory agenda that seeks revisions to key academic measurements in the existing law, as well as changes to eligibility requirements for nontraditional programs like \u201ccompetency-based education\u201d to obtain more federal financial aid. Competency-based education makes the acquisition of specific skills \u2014 not just test-taking and attendance \u2014 key graduation requirements. The department has also proposed to review what defines \u201cregular and substantive interaction\u201d between faculty members and students in programs where students are not physically present in classrooms, and to review the \u201ccredit hour,\u201d which is used to measure progress toward completing a college degree. Colleges have complained that the credit-hour rule is too prescriptive. It is also looking to review rules governing the role that accrediting agencies should play in securing federal financial aid for institutions, and that states should play in overseeing programs operating in their jurisdictions. Liz Hill, a spokeswoman for Ms. DeVos, said the secretary was in constant communication with Republican leaders in the House and the Senate, and \u201cis unequivocally supportive of their efforts to reauthorize the H.E.A. this Congress.\u201d \u201cWhile a full rewrite of the law by Congress is the preferred method for fixing H.E.A., it requires a willingness by Democrats to come to the table,\u201d she said. \u201cAs long as Democrats continue to be unwilling to engage in productive bipartisan discussions around common-sense solutions, the department must move forward with the law that we have. Students don\u2019t have time to wait, and they, along with schools and taxpayers, deserve certainty and relief from the regulatory overreach by the previous administration.\u201d While regulatory agendas often serve as wish lists, and re-regulating can take years, higher education experts say they do not underestimate Ms. DeVos. Already, she has moved to renegotiate rules the Obama administration used to target for-profit colleges after they were tarred by scandal. In recent months, the department renegotiated \u201cborrower defense to repayment\u201d rules that had made it easier for defrauded students to be relieved of federal debts, as well as \u201cgainful employment\u201d rules that cut off loans to colleges if their graduates do not earn enough money to pay off their student debt. Ms. DeVos also announced last month that she would delay, by two more years, a rule that requires online programs to gain approval from states where they enroll students. The next set of rules is far less controversial, but carries perhaps a greater impact, experts say. \u201cWhat she\u2019s looking at now are these building blocks of college that define what an institution means,\u201d said Amy Laitinen, a former Obama administration staff member who is now the director of higher education at New America, a research group that has analyzed Ms. DeVos\u2019s agenda. \u201cThey\u2019re so in the weeds, they\u2019re so esoteric, it\u2019s really easy for these particular regulations to fly under the radar. It\u2019s really smart of her, because they\u2019re so intertwined.\u201d New America concluded that Ms. DeVos\u2019s deregulatory agenda reflects a systemic approach to tackling a \u201ctriad\u201d \u2014 oversight by the state, accreditors and the Education Department \u2014 that institutions require to maintain access to financial aid. If she succeeds, \u201cthere is certainty of free-flowing money no matter how well institutions do,\u201d Ms. Laitinen said. But some industry leaders see Ms. DeVos\u2019s regulatory agenda as a road map for innovation. \u201cWe do have an outdated regulatory system that needs revising in a responsible way,\u201d said Brian Jones, president of Strayer University, a for-profit college system that specializes in educating adult students. \u201cWe would like to see some real thinking around how institutions meet the evolving demands for students because we are in an environment that demands more flexibility and innovation.\u201d Mr. Alexander on Thursday largely backed Ms. DeVos\u2019s measures. He said the federal government needed to find ways to infuse innovation into the system. He endorsed the review of program eligibility rules for financial aid, \u201cso you just don\u2019t get paid whether your butt\u2019s in a seat or not; you get paid if you\u2019re learning.\u201d And he praised Ms. DeVos\u2019s willingness to tackle complex topics, such as Title IX, the part of the Higher Education Act that governs sexual harassment and misconduct on campuses. Ms. DeVos is revising existing rules to be more sensitive to students and faculty members accused of misconduct and to pull back from automatic investigations into virtually any allegation. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of uncertainty around what sexual harassment means,\u201d Mr. Alexander said. \u201cAll that\u2019s been done in intervening years have been letters and guidances that have no rule of law.\u201d He also hinted that regulations approved by the Obama administration\u2019s Education Department on for-profit higher education institutions may have gone too far. The sector was rocked by scandal after thousands of students were signed up with federally guaranteed student loans but could find no work after graduation. Loans worth hundreds of millions of dollars ended in default, with taxpayers on the hook. The Obama administration\u2019s regulatory response bankrupted some institutions. Now the Trump administration is examining regulatory changes that could allow for a comeback. \u201cI think the same rules ought to be applied to all institutions,\u201d Mr. Alexander said. He also criticized what he saw as a rising tide of left-wing intolerance on the nation\u2019s campuses and worried openly that higher education was becoming a partisan issue, with support for college slipping among his colleagues as conservative scholarship is denigrated. \u201cEighty percent of the drop of support for higher education on the Republican side is a real frustration with the underrepresented points of view,\u201d he said, citing the tumultuous greetings that the conservative scholar Charles Murray has received on campuses. \u201cWe don\u2019t want a whole generation of students who have to go to a safe room when they read an offensive tweet,\u201d he said. \u201cColleges are supposed to be places where you learn to deal with the world you\u2019re about to be in.\u201d",

GreenPRINT EDITIONDeVos Undoes Obama Curbs On For-Profits|August 11, 2018, Page A1",
      "author": "Erica L. Green",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Education Secretary Betsy DeVos formally moved Friday to scrap a regulation that would have forced for-profit colleges to prove that the students they enroll are able to attain decent-paying jobs, the most drastic in a series of policy shifts that will free the scandal-scarred, for-profit sector from safeguards put in effect during the Obama era. In a written announcement posted on its website, the Education Department laid out its plans to eliminate the so-called gainful employment rule, which sought to hold for-profit and career college programs accountable for graduating students with poor job prospects and overwhelming debt. The Obama-era rule would have revoked federal funding and access to financial aid for poor-performing schools. After a 30-day comment period, the rule is expected to be eliminated July 1, 2019. Instead Ms. DeVos would provide students with more data about all of the nation\u2019s higher education institutions \u2014 not just career and for-profit college programs \u2014 including debt, expected earnings after graduation, completion rates, program cost, accreditation and other measures. \u201cStudents deserve useful and relevant data when making important decisions about their education post-high school,\u201d Ms. DeVos said in a statement. \u201cThat\u2019s why instead of targeting schools simply by their tax status, this administration is working to ensure students have transparent, meaningful information about all colleges and all programs. Our new approach will aid students across all sectors of higher education and improve accountability.\u201d But in rescinding the rule, the department is eradicating the most fearsome accountability measures \u2014 the loss of federal aid \u2014 for schools that promise to prepare students for specific careers but fail to prepare them for the job market, leaving taxpayers on the hook to pay back their taxpayer-backed loans. The DeVos approach is reversing nearly a decade of efforts to create a tough accountability system for the largely unregulated for-profit sector of higher education. In recent years, large for-profit chains, which offer training for everything from automotive mechanics to cosmetology to cybersecurity, have collapsed under mountains of complaints and lawsuits for employing misleading and deceptive practices. The implosions of ITT Technical Institute and Corinthian Colleges generated tens of thousands of complaints from student borrowers who said they were left with worthless degrees. The Obama administration encouraged the expansion of public community colleges as it forgave at least $450 million in taxpayer-funded student debt for for-profit graduates who could not find decent jobs with the degrees or certificates they had earned. The regulations passed in the wake of those scandals remade the industry. Since 2010, when the Obama administration began deliberating the rules, more than 2,000 for-profit and career programs \u2014 nearly half \u2014 have closed, and the industry\u2019s student population has dropped by more than 1.6 million, said Steve Gunderson, the president of Career Education Colleges and Universities, the for-profit industry\u2019s trade association. Even for-profit leaders concede the gainful employment rule has had its intended effect. Mr. Gunderson said that for-profit institutions had to adjust programming to be more affordable and responsive to the job markets. \u201cThe other side should declare victory and go home,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reality is every school that has a program that was failing gainful employment metrics \u2014 and they knew it couldn\u2019t be fixed \u2014 they\u2019ve already closed. The sector today is so much better.\u201d Former Obama administration officials said this was no time to leave the field. \u201cBy withdrawing the gainful employment regulations, the Trump administration is once again choosing the interests of executives and shareholders of predatory for-profit higher education institutions over protecting students and taxpayers,\u201d said John King, the Obama-era education secretary charged with enforcing the rule, who called the move \u201coutrageous and irresponsible.\u201d Ms. DeVos has brought into her administration former for-profit leaders who are known for their strong opposition to the industry\u2019s regulation. Ethics filings show that Diane Auer Jones, a senior adviser on postsecondary education, lobbied against funding the rule while working for an operator of for-profit schools, Career Education Corporation. Another top-ranking official, Robert S. Eitel, who joined the department from a for-profit operator, Bridgepoint Education Inc., when it faced multiple government investigations. Mr. Eitel, who has also opposed the gainful employment regulations, recused himself from weighing in on the rule. \u201cRescinding the rule is a derogation of the department\u2019s duty to protect students from exploitation and taxpayers from the waste of federal funds,\u201d said the New York attorney general, Barbara D. Underwood, whose office joined 17 other state attorneys general that sued the department for delaying its enforcement. The 2014 rule required for-profit institutions to measure how much debt their students incurred against their post-graduation earnings and ordered them to disclose their failing marks in advertisements. A year ago, Ms. DeVos delayed those parts of the regulations for taking effect. But one part of the rule that had already been put into place has identified hundreds of failing programs, many of which went on to shut their doors after they were measured against the new standards, according to an analysis by New America Foundation. That regulation will also be eliminated. In the first assessment of college graduates\u2019 debt-to-earnings ratios, about 800 programs, or 10 percent of those examined, had failed to meet the requirements laid out in the gainful employment rule, the department announced; of those, 98 percent were for-profits. But industry leaders say the rules had ample collateral damage. More than 15 years ago, Michael Halmon was selling beauty supplies in Florida when he got into the business of helping people who were not cut out for college attain a craft. His American Institute of Beauty trained beauticians and barbers. But the Obama administration treated Mr. Halmon and his colleagues like predators, he said. The American Institute of Beauty was among several schools that successfully sued the Education Department over the gainful employment rule, arguing that their earnings data did not reflect all sources of income, such as tips, that are unique to their industry. \u201cWe are mom-and-pop businesses, not these huge Wall Street entities getting rich off of tens of thousands of students,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a thriving industry, and it could have been decimated.\u201d Jarrod Thoma, 35, an Army veteran who has a claim pending with the Education Department against the for-profit DeVry University, said he was \u201cat a loss for words\u201d by the idea that such schools had nothing more to prove. He graduated from DeVry with a degree in electronics engineering in March 2015, and he only recently secured his first full-time engineering job with benefits this July. The school agreed to a $100 million settlement over claims that they misled prospective students with inflated employment and earnings success rates. \u201cI busted my butt for years, doing far more than what my jobs entailed, to prove that I was worth more than $18.50,\u201d Mr. Thoma said. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d In its notification on Friday, the department said Ms. DeVos was rescinding the gainful employment rule entirely based on research that undermined the \u201cvalidity of using the debt and earnings comparisons.\u201d That research, the department contended, was not properly considered by the Obama administration when it was writing the rules in 2014. Officials wrote that they also found \u201ca troubling degree of inconsistency and potential error exists in job placement rates\u201d that \u201ccould mislead students in making an enrollment decisions.\u201d The department also said that requirement that schools disclose their data had proved to be \u201cmore burdensome than originally anticipated.\u201d The department also wrote that the Obama regulations \u201creinforce an inaccurate and outdated belief that career and vocational programs are less valuable to students and less valued by society, and that these programs should be held to a higher degree of accountability than traditional two- and four-year degree programs that may have less market value.\u201d The move further divided congressional leaders on the direction of higher education, as efforts stalled this year to rewrite the federal law governing higher education. A House bill drafted by Representative Virginia Foxx, Republican of North Carolina, would eliminate the gainful employment rule by statute. Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee and the chairman of the Senate Education Committee, praised Ms. DeVos\u2019s plan, saying that it gave Congress an opportunity to hold all schools accountable. \u201cSecretary DeVos\u2019s regulation proposes to end a clumsy rule that consumed 945 pages to define two words in the higher education law and targeted just one segment of our 6,000 colleges and universities,\u201d Mr. Alexander said. Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington and the ranking member of the Senate committee, said in a statement that Ms. Devos was undermining a \u201ccommon-sense and effective consumer protection.\u201d \u201cHer extreme proposal to rescind this rule is further proof that there is no line Secretary DeVos won\u2019t cross to pad the pockets of for-profit colleges \u2014 even leaving students and taxpayers to foot the bill,\u201d she said.",

GreenPRINT EDITIONDeVos Halts Debt Relief After Judge Slams Process|June 7, 2018, Page A17",
      "author": "Erica L. Green",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has temporarily halted relieving the debt of some student borrowers who were defrauded by the now-defunct Corinthian Colleges, after a federal judge found her department misused earnings data to calculate loan forgiveness. In response to a court order last week, the Education Department said that it would grant a temporary postponement of loan payments for Corinthian students in lieu of federal debt-relief claims. It also said it would stop collection payments for four students who sued the department over its new formula for determining how much debt they would have to repay. The halt came after Magistrate Judge Sallie Kim of Federal District Court in San Francisco found that the department had violated the Privacy Act by sharing student borrower information, such as Social Security numbers and birth dates, with the Social Security Administration to obtain earnings data. The judge ordered the Education Department to end the practice and its collection of Corinthian student debts. In December, Ms. DeVos announced a new system to manage the thousands of students who filed so-called borrower-defense claims after several for-profit colleges began imploding in scandal in 2015, leaving students saddled with debt and tarnished degrees. The department began dividing borrowers according to a tiered system of debt relief, based on whether they had gone on to find gainful employment. Judge Kim\u2019s ruling resulted from a class-action lawsuit filed by the Project on Predatory Student Lending of the Legal Services Center of Harvard Law School and the group Housing and Economic Rights Advocates, which challenged Ms. DeVos\u2019s partial-relief system shortly after it was announced. They argued that the new policy was arbitrary, capricious and illegal. While the plaintiffs cheered the judge\u2019s order, they maintained that the department has already illegally granted only partial relief to thousands of students and has left thousands more in limbo. Another hearing is scheduled for next week to determine whether the department will be required to grant full relief to all students. \u201cThe court has already ruled that the Department of Education must immediately stop using its illegal partial denial rule,\u201d said Eileen Connor, litigation director for the Project on Predatory Student Lending. \u201cApparently the Department of Education will go to any lengths to side against defrauded students.\u201d In her ruling, the judge ordered the department to halt the use of its \u201caverage earnings rule,\u201d which has been used to determine borrower-defense claims since December. But the order did not rule on the department\u2019s ability to issue partial relief, only that its methodology was illegal. The Education Department made clear in its response to the ruling that it still believes that using earnings data is the best method for determining how much relief students should receive from the federal government. \u201cWe\u2019re encouraged that the court recognized the secretary\u2019s discretion to establish a borrower defense claims process that determines compensation based on harm incurred by the borrower,\u201d said Liz Hill, the Education Department\u2019s spokeswoman. The department told the judge that it would continue assessing the validity of borrower-defense claims \u2014 as of April 1, there were 147,000 total claims filed, and 99,000 claims pending \u2014 and explore ways of using earnings data to \u201cassess educational value in a manner that would not implicate the Privacy Act.\u201d Education Department officials proposed options such as using publicly available data, or requesting earnings information from borrowers themselves. Ms. DeVos has defended the new system as a reversal from an \u201call or nothing\u201d approach to loan forgiveness, by relieving students of debt based on whether they received any educational benefit from their institutions. She said the new calculation would allow claims to be adjudicated quickly and \u201cprotects taxpayers from being forced to shoulder massive costs that may be unjustified.\u201d Students whose earnings are less than 50 percent of graduates from a comparable education program would receive full relief. Those whose earnings are at 50 percent or more of their peers will receive \u201cproportionally tiered relief to compensate for the difference and make them whole.\u201d According to the judge\u2019s order, the department identified 79 Corinthian programs and submitted information identifying the names of 61,717 former Corinthian students to obtain earnings data. More than 10,000 students have received partial relief, attorneys said. In the case of the four plaintiffs, the judge found that the students \u201chave shown irreparable harm because the economic harm they are suffering affects their ability to pay for life\u2019s most basic necessities.\u201d Alina Farajian was promised that she could attend Everest College to become a medical assistant, even though she had a learning disability. She was told that the college would help her get a job, and the brochures boasted high placement rates. So she and her mother borrowed $15,000. The only job Ms. Farajian was able to get in her field was a one-month temporary position. She now drives a Lyft and nets $250 a month. The department forgave 30 percent of her loan. Jennifer Craig was sold on the job-placement rates at Everest College in California, where she borrowed $9,019 to study medical insurance and billing. Although she was able to graduate, she never received a diploma because the school closed. With no diploma and only one year of training, she was not able to find work in her field. The department forgave 20 percent of her loan.",

      "author": "Michael D. Shear",
      "content": " ORANGE COUNTY, Fla. \u2014 President Trump on Friday hailed a Florida school tuition assistance program as the future of education, joining Betsy DeVos, his education secretary, at a Catholic elementary classroom to kick off an intense political battle on behalf of school choice in America. The president and Ms. DeVos, who for years championed school vouchers as an antidote to failing schools and falling test scores, met with parents, teachers and students at St. Andrew Catholic School, which has embraced a Florida program that uses public money to allow low-income students to attend private schools. Hundreds of low-income students, many of them African-Americans, attend the private religious school thanks to tuition assistance from the Florida Tax Credit scholarship program. Critics say it diverts money that would otherwise go to the state\u2019s public school system. Tuition at the school, just outside Orlando, is normally $6,260 per year, according to the school\u2019s website. The Florida scholarship program allows businesses in the state to receive tax credits for donating to nonprofit scholarship organizations that give tuition assistance for students to attend schools like St. Andrew. The families\u2019 portion of the tuition bill varies. The program\u2019s goals, according to the website, are to \u201cexpand education opportunities for children from families that have limited financial resources; and to enable children to achieve a greater level of excellence in their education.\u201d Such programs are at the heart of the promised changes that Ms. DeVos and Mr. Trump have said they will bring to federal education policy. But they are seen by teachers unions and many Democrats as destructive to the health of public education systems, offering a false promise of choice while undermining the financial stability of public schools. Democrats assailed Ms. DeVos for her support of vouchers during her contentious Senate confirmation hearing. But Friday\u2019s visit to the religious school is a clear indication that she has no intention of backing down from her longstanding advocacy of the idea. She also has the clear backing of the president, who said during his address to Congress this week that he would seek to \u201cenrich the mind, and the souls\u201d of children across the country. \u201cI am calling upon members of both parties to pass an education bill that funds school choice for disadvantaged youth, including millions of African-American and Latino children,\u201d Mr. Trump said in the speech. \u201cThese families should be free to choose the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school that is right for them.\u201d At the school on Friday, Mr. Trump stopped in on a fourth-grade classroom where the teacher, Jane Jones, was giving a lesson about the state of Florida. The vocabulary list on the wall included definitions for \u201cGovernment. US Constitution. Limit. President. Governor. Naturalization.\u201d \u201cWho are we?\u201d Latrina Peters-Gipson, the school\u2019s principal, asked after Mr. Trump entered the room. \u201cWe are scholars,\u201d the students responded. \u201cWhat are our goals? Where are we going?\u201d Ms. Peters-Gipson asked. \u201cCollege and heaven,\u201d they said in unison. The president posed for pictures with two of the young children, telling them, \u201cCome on, kids. We\u2019re going to make you famous.\u201d As he left the classroom, he complimented two of the African-American girls. \u201cOh, that hair is beautiful. I love that hair, right?\u201d the president said. St. Andrew school teaches children from kindergarten to eighth grade. It enrolls 291 students through Florida\u2019s tax credit scholarship program, out of a total school enrollment of 340. In an opinion article in the Orlando Sentinel on Thursday, Ms. Peters-Gipson said the school offered \u201ca rigorous blend of academics and faith.\u201d \u201cThe parents who come through our doors don\u2019t tend to see public and private as somehow in conflict,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re just looking for the school that will best serve their children.\u201d At a round-table discussion with Mr. Trump after his visit to the classroom, Ms. Peters-Gipson and others praised the success of the scholarship program. Henry Fortier, the superintendent of Catholic schools, said that graduates of the Florida scholarship program statewide scored higher than other public school students on the SAT and had high graduation rates. \u201cI know that there\u2019s a lot of controversy about school choice,\u201d Mr. Fortier told the president. But he added: \u201cI see it as a partnership. It\u2019s not a situation of us versus them.\u201d But teachers\u2019 groups argue that the Florida efforts to provide choice harm the state\u2019s public schools by reducing taxpayer support for schools that are struggling, leaving the students who remain in them worse off. Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, said in a statement that the president and the education secretary were demonstrating an \u201cantipathy\u201d toward public schools. \u201cIt\u2019s sad that rather than listening to the public they are sworn to represent and who have a deep connection to public schools, Trump and DeVos\u2019 first official joint trip is to a religious school, which they use as a backdrop for their ideological crusade,\u201d she said. Despite the fierce opposition from teachers and Democrats, Mr. Trump has said he will ask Congress to pass a school choice law that will clear the way for more programs like the one in Florida. During the round-table discussion at the school, Mr. Trump quoted the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. as saying that he hoped inferior education would become a thing of the past. The president said that working toward a national school choice policy would help make that a reality. \u201cBetsy\u2019s going to lead the charge, right?\u201d Mr. Trump said, turning to his education secretary. \u201cYou bet,\u201d she said.",

Will Revisit Obama-Era Campus Sexual Assault Policies|July 14, 2017, Page A16",
      "author": "Sheryl Gay Stolberg",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Education Secretary Betsy DeVos signaled on Thursday that she intends to take a hard look at whether the Obama administration\u2019s campus rape policies deprived accused students of their rights, saying that \u201ca system without due process ultimately serves no one in the end.\u201d The comments, Ms. DeVos\u2019s first on the issue of how the Education Department will handle sexual assault on college and university campuses, came at a news conference after what she called a \u201creally emotionally draining day\u201d of meeting with victims, students who had been accused and higher education officials. \u201cIt was clear that their stories have not often been told, and that there are lives that have been ruined and lives that are lost in the process,\u201d Ms. DeVos said, referring to accused students. But she was careful to say that she intends to protect victims\u2019 rights as well. \u201cWe can\u2019t go back to the days when allegations were swept under the rug,\u201d Ms. DeVos said, \u201cand I acknowledge there was a time when women were essentially dismissed. That is not acceptable.\u201d How to enforce Title IX, the 1972 law requiring schools to protect students from rape and sexual assault, is one of Ms. DeVos\u2019s most difficult policy tasks, and her department has been under fire for comments made this week by Candice Jackson, who leads its Office for Civil Rights. In an interview with The New York Times, Ms. Jackson said that \u201c90 percent\u201d of sexual assault accusations on campus \u201cfall into the category of \u2018we were both drunk,\u2019 \u2018we broke up, and six months later I found myself under a Title IX investigation because she just decided that our last sleeping together was not quite right.\u2019\u201d Ms. Jackson later apologized, called her remarks \u201cflippant\u201d and said they were based on feedback from accused students. That did not mollify victims of sexual assault and their supporters, who staged a protest outside the Education Department headquarters Thursday morning. \u201cUnfortunately those remarks are now out there, and at the highest levels they need to undo that damage by countering those myths about rape,\u201d said Fatima Goss Graves, president of the National Women\u2019s Law Center, which helped organize the demonstration. Referring to Ms. DeVos, she said: \u201cShe has to reject the idea that rape is just regretted sex. She has to reject the idea that most women lie, and she has to say it and say it and say it again.\u201d One major issue before Ms. DeVos is whether to rescind a letter issued in 2011 by the Obama administration that urged colleges and universities to take a tough stance on rape on campus or risk losing federal funding. Another question is whether her department will instruct schools to change the standard of evidence used to determine whether students are responsible for sexual assault. The Obama administration asked colleges to adopt a \u201cpreponderance of evidence\u201d standard, a lower bar than the \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d threshold that many schools had been using. Some accused students have protested that the lower standard turned nebulous cases into grounds for discipline or suspension. Ms. DeVos did not reveal her plans but hinted she would take action soon. \u201cWe need to do this right, we need to protect all students and we need to do it quickly,\u201d she said. Among the accused students who told their stories to Ms. DeVos on Thursday was Joseph Roberts, who said he was three weeks from graduating from Savannah State University in Georgia in 2013 when he received an email from the university accusing him of sexual harassment. He was \u201csummarily suspended,\u201d he said in an interview, \u201cpending the outcome of a hearing that never happened.\u201d Mr. Roberts, who enrolled in college after serving in the Navy and is now 36, said he was \u201cdeemed a threat to the campus community\u201d and was not allowed to return. He was allowed to graduate by taking classes online. He sued the school in federal court, but the case was dismissed. A spokeswoman for the university declined to comment on the case, but said the university was \u201ccommitted to providing a safe campus environment\u201d and ensuring students\u2019 due process. Mr. Roberts has been working in Washington with a group called FACE (Families Advocating for Campus Equality), but he said many lawmakers have not listened to him. \u201cThis was the first time that I felt like a decision maker, like a government official listened and was sincere and she was patient and she cared,\u201d he said. But advocates for victims cautioned Ms. DeVos not to forget those who have been sexually assaulted. \u201cThe rights of the accused are just as important as the rights of survivors,\u201d said Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a New York Democrat, who has made combating campus rape a signature issue, and who spoke at Thursday\u2019s demonstration. \u201cBut what we\u2019ve seen over the last several decades is a disregard for survivors. Not only are they disbelieved but they are retaliated against for reporting these crimes.\u201d",

      "author": "Erica L. Green",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 The Education Department failed to approve a single application for federal student loan relief in the second half of last year, according to new department data that signals that students who claim they were cheated by their colleges cannot count on help from Washington anytime soon. The department neither approved nor denied any relief claims filed by students under the so-called borrower defense program from June to December 2018, even after a federal judge ruled that the Trump administration\u2019s foot-dragging was illegal. In October, the judge ordered the Education Department to enforce a long-delayed Obama-era rule that expanded and expedited loan relief for defrauded students, many of whom attended for-profit colleges. Amid that inaction, the number of pending claims has swelled to more than 150,000 \u2014 over double the number of applications the department inherited from the previous administration. And with no firm timeline to process them, advocates say the department has referred borrowers to the Treasury Department to have their tax refunds garnished to offset debts that have piled up while their claim is pending. Liz Hill, a spokeswoman for the Education Department, blamed the delay on the swirl of lawsuits filed by advocates pressing for a more generous response to loan-relief applicants. \u201cPending litigation has slowed down the department\u2019s processing to provide relief to additional borrowers,\u201d Ms. Hill said. \u201cWe will fully implement the 2016 borrower defense regulations and ensure those who qualify for discharge receive it.\u201d About 22,000 approved applications that are waiting to be discharged are delayed because of lawsuits, the department said, as it \u201ccontinues to assess alternatives to provide a fair, balanced and consistent approach for legitimate borrower defense applications.\u201d Ms. Hill added that the department was taking steps to increase its capacity to manage applications, which in recent months have been coming in at nearly 2,000 a week. Last month, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos offered no such assurances when pressed by senators about the backlog. \u201cDon\u2019t you have a heart?\u201d Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat, asked Ms. DeVos at a hearing on the department\u2019s budget, where he cited 140,000 \u201cvictim students waiting on your department to give them relief so they can get on with their lives.\u201d He noted that many of the students were defrauded by predatory for-profit schools, which Ms. DeVos has been accused of favoring with her policies. Nine percent of high school graduates go to for-profit colleges and universities, but 34 percent of loan defaults belong to those students. \u201cNo student should be defrauded, and if fraud is involved, there are consequences, and there will be consequences,\u201d Ms. DeVos replied. \u201cBut we should not be judging institutions by their tax status. Let\u2019s be very honest here; there are bad actors on both sides of the equation.\u201d She added, with some indignance, \u201cLet\u2019s talk about the nonprofits that are doing a bad job, that are subject to bribes, that are lying in order to improve their U.S. News and World Report statistics,\u201d referring to the recent college admissions scandal rocking Ivy League and other elite institutions. Since taking office, Ms. DeVos has tried to overhaul the 2016 process started by the Obama administration that was supposed to pave an easier road for students to secure loan relief after their colleges are found to have misled them with inflated claims of false promises of jobs. The Obama administration approved nearly 30,000 such claims, estimated at $450 million, in its last year in office. The Education Department approved 16,155 from Jan. 1, 2017 to December 31, 2018. The Obama administration rewrote the borrower defense rule, which was virtually unknown until 2015, when two large for-profit chains, ITT Technical Institute and Corinthian Colleges, began to crumble. The new rule was supposed to take effect in 2017. But Ms. DeVos delayed issuing what she said amounted to \u201cfree money\u201d and has moved to narrow its scope to only forgive debts of students who, regardless of their schools\u2019 actions, fail to secure gainful employment and can prove they were otherwise harmed. A 2017 report from the department\u2019s inspector general found that the Obama process had some flaws. Ms. DeVos  instituted a tiered system to grant some borrowers partial relief, but those measures were struck down by the courts. The department then blew a deadline to rewrite the rules, which were supposed to go into force this year. Ms. Hill, the department spokeswoman, said that under Ms. DeVos, the department has discharged nearly 50,000 borrower defense claims, the bulk of which were queued up by the Obama administration, totaling more than $534 million. She said it has also enforced part of the 2016 Obama regulation that automatically relieves students of debt when a school closes. As of February, the department discharged approximately 51,000 loans for 15,000 borrowers, totaling more than $158 million. But applications have continued to pile up as the department charts its next move. Education Department officials released data in response to a request from Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, showing that it still had 158,000 pending claims. The data covered the period from September to December, but officials wrote that those had not changed since the previous quarter. The department did not say whether it has approved or denied any borrower defense claims in 2019. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing stopping Secretary DeVos from providing relief to struggling borrowers today, and she needs to begin approving claims immediately so students who were cheated out of their education and savings get the relief they are entitled to,\u201d Ms. Murray said in a statement. Eileen Connor, the director of litigation at Harvard Law School\u2019s Project on Predatory Student Lending, said that she had borrowers who had claims pending from as far back as four years. The project, which represents thousands of students from ITT Tech and Corinthian, said that it had over 14,000 applications from ITT Tech pending at the department. Only 33 have been approved, and those were by the Obama administration. Zero have been approved under Ms. DeVos. Debt on the loans has continued to grow, Ms. Connor said. In lawsuits, the group has described how borrowers have experienced anxiety, fear and psychological and financial distress caused by delays. The project has won several lawsuits against Ms. DeVos. But it said that the department continued to ignore crucial court rulings, including one that found the department could not take tax refunds of former Corinthian College students to pay their student loans while they have borrower defense applications pending. \u201cThe department\u2019s delay is not neutral,\u201d Ms. Connor said. \u201cIt\u2019s harming students.\u201d",

GreenPRINT EDITIONDeVos Proposes Curtailing Loan Forgiveness for Defrauded Students|July 26, 2018, Page A14",
      "author": "Erica L. Green",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Education Secretary Betsy DeVos proposed on Wednesday to curtail Obama administration loan forgiveness rules for students defrauded by for-profit colleges, requiring that student borrowers show they have fallen into hopeless financial straits or prove that their colleges knowingly deceived them. The DeVos proposal, set to go in force a year from now, would replace Obama-era policies that sought to ease access to loan forgiveness for students who were left saddled with debt after two for-profit college chains, Corinthian Colleges and ITT Technical Institute, imploded in 2015 and 2016. The schools were found to have misled their students with false advertisements and misleading claims for years. Afterward, the Obama administration forgave hundreds of millions of dollars in student loans and began rewriting regulations to crack down on predatory institutions and bolster borrowers\u2019 ability to seek debt relief from the federal government. But higher education institutions, including historically black colleges and universities and for-profit educators, maintained the new rules were far too broad and subjected them to frivolous claims that carried significant financial risks. In June 2017, just one month before the Obama rules were to take effect, Ms. DeVos announced that she would block and rewrite them. Now the Trump administration is proposing new rules that would require borrowers to prove that they have fallen into deep financial distress to file a claim for debt relief, or to prove that the higher education institutions they attended had intentionally misled them. The department would also require that relief applicants divulge personal information that could have impacted their job prospects beyond their college experiences, including drug test results, health concerns and performance evaluations. The proposal would establish a federal standard for what constitutes \u201cmisrepresentation\u201d on the part of institutions, requiring that claims show \u201creckless disregard\u201d through false or deceptive claims. It would also impose penalties on institutions that show signs of poor financial health, such as a high number of loan defaults or court judgments. The new rules lay out \u201cclear rules of the road for higher education institutions to follow\u201d while \u201cholding institutions, rather than hardworking taxpayers, accountable for making whole those students who were harmed by an institution\u2019s practices,\u201d Ms. DeVos said in a statement. \u201cOur commitment and our focus has been and remains on protecting students from fraud.\u201d The new rules would save the government about $700 million a year, compared with those proposed by the Obama administration, a senior administration official said. The department will take public comment on the proposals for 30 days, and the rules are set to go into effect in July 2019. Advocates for student borrowers said that savings was nothing to cheer. The new rules would establish insurmountable barriers to relief for many vulnerable students, and would eliminate accountability for institutions that employ predatory tactics in recruitment and advertising, they said. \u201cThe Department of Education is turning a blind eye to widespread fraud and abuse at for-profit schools that left thousands of students in debt without a meaningful education,\u201d said Suzanne Martindale, a senior attorney for Consumers Union. \u201cInstead of helping defrauded students cancel their debts and move on with their lives, these proposed rules would shield poor-performing schools from being held accountable for their misconduct.\u201d Critics accused Ms. DeVos of stocking her department with former executives of for-profit colleges and universities to free the industry from oversight. DeVos advisers include her senior counselor, Robert S. Eitel, and Diane Auer Jones, a senior adviser on postsecondary education, both of whom worked for Career Education Corporation, a company that operates for-profit colleges, and reached a $10.25 million settlement with the New York attorney general over charges that it had inflated graduates\u2019 job placement rates. The department\u2019s general counsel, Carlos G. Mu\u00f1iz, worked as a consultant for the company. \u201cWith the stroke of a pen, Secretary DeVos and her team of former for-profit college executives have proposed giving fraudulent institutions de facto immunity while effectively stripping their victims of a realistic path to debt relief,\u201d said Aaron Ament, the president of the National Student Legal Defense Network. When Ms. DeVos halted the Obama-era rules, she declared: \u201cLast year\u2019s rule-making effort missed an opportunity to get it right. The result is a muddled process that\u2019s unfair to students and schools, and puts taxpayers on the hook for significant costs.\u201d She also criticized the Obama rules as being too lenient. In December, she reversed an Obama-era policy of granting full debt relief for students by instituting a tiered system that granted partial relief for federal loans based on whether students went on to be gainfully employed. The decision was made, in part, because the department\u2019s inspector general found that the Obama administration lacked a sufficient infrastructure to process claims. A California magistrate ruled last month that the program violated the federal Privacy Act because it improperly used earnings data from the Social Security Administration. In its court filings, the department said it has sought information on more than 61,000 students, and had granted 10,000 of them partial debt relief. Last fall, Ms. DeVos began revising the Obama-era rules, convening a committee of department officials, higher education advocates and for-profit college leaders to hash out a new approach. Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee and the chairman of the Senate Education Committee, indicated that he thought the new rules got the balance right. The Obama administration set \u201coverly broad and vague standards and, as a result, put taxpayers on the hook for too many loans,\u201d he said. But Democrats say Ms. DeVos\u2019s policies continue to favor industry leaders over vulnerable students. \u201cUnder the leadership of Secretary DeVos, the Trump administration is sending an alarming message: Schools can cheat student borrowers and still reap the rewards of federal student aid,\u201d said Representative Robert C. Scott of Virginia, the top Democrat on the House Education Committee. The rules would grant stronger recourse for higher education institutions accused of fraud, including an opportunity to review claims and respond to the department with evidence in their defense. \u201cCarte blanche approval of batches of applications would only serve to cut off access and opportunity for future students,\u201d said Steve Gunderson, the president of the trade group Career Education Colleges and Universities, which represents several for-profit and trade schools. The proposal also restores \u201cpre-dispute arbitration agreements,\u201d which allow colleges to force students to sign waivers saying they will settle their disputes with institutions through arbitration. The Obama administration had removed those agreements from its rule because they essentially forced to students to sign away their rights to sue and file federal claims, and shielded student complaints from the public. The department official said the agreements would allow students to settle their claims more quickly and potentially recoup more compensation beyond their loans. The department said that it would ensure that schools were transparent about students\u2019 rights under the agreements, but that borrowers bore some responsibility. \u201cPostsecondary students are adults who can be reasonably expected to make informed decisions if they have access to relevant and reliable data about program outcomes,\u201d officials wrote in their proposal. The rules also tighten criteria for borrowers to seek debt relief if they enrolled in schools that later closed. Under the Obama rules, students would not have been eligible for loan forgiveness if they transferred their credits or completed a program at another school. The new rules would disqualify students from loan forgiveness if the closed institution simply offered an opportunity to finish their coursework elsewhere. The administration is also rescinding an Obama proposal that automatically forgave loans for students whose school had closed and who did not enroll in another one within three years. That process now requires an application. The department is also considering whether to maintain a \u201cpreponderance of evidence\u201d standard or a more stringent \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d standard for loan forgiveness. Officials said they wanted to make sure the standard ensures that claims are not lodged over unofficial or offhand comments. They suggested that if students can provide documentation of questionable advertisements, that could qualify as an institution \u201cknowingly\u201d providing misleading information. But advocates for student borrowers contended that no amount of documentation might matter if relief applicants are required to prove not only the actions of their institutions but also their intent.",

      "content": " A chorus of Democratic lawmakers have joined the education secretary, Betsy DeVos, in calling for Congress to act after a gunman killed 17 people at a high school in Parkland, Fla. In a letter on Friday, all 17 Democrats on the House Education Committee urged Representative Virginia Foxx, the committee\u2019s chairwoman, to convene hearings on school shootings, describing them as a \u201cpublic health epidemic.\u201d The panel has not addressed the issue since February 2013 \u2014 two months after a shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut left 20 first graders and six adults dead, they said. \u201cWednesday\u2019s preventable tragedy at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, resulted in the deaths of at least 17 students and faculty,\u201d the letter said. \u201cSadly, since the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School five years ago, more than 430 people have been shot in over 230 school shootings.\u201d The letter adds pressure on Congress to address the pervasiveness of school shootings across the country, an issue that Ms. DeVos raised during an interview on Thursday with the conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt. \u201cCongress needs to be holding hearings on these issues,\u201d Ms. DeVos said, adding: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen, you know, lots of finger pointing back and forth. But we need to have a conversation at the level where lawmakers can actually impact the future, because going back to and putting myself in the seat of one of those families impacted, one of these shootings is one too many. And we have got to have an honest conversation, and Congress has to lead on this. It\u2019s their job.\u201d Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the top Democrat on the Senate Education Committee, said she \u201cwholeheartedly\u201d agreed with the suggestion and invited Ms. DeVos to testify. \u201cFamilies across the country are tired of waiting for Congress to step up, have the tough conversations, and adopt common sense gun safety and other policies to end this scourge in our schools and communities,\u201d Ms. Murray said in a statement. Asked whether she believed teachers should be allowed and trained to carry weapons, Ms. DeVos said only that it was \u201can important issue for all states to grapple with and to tackle,\u201d and that it \u201cneeds to be part of the broader, more robust conversation about how can we avoid these things in the future.\u201d Ms. DeVos did not say whether her department would encourage superintendents to work with law enforcement to identify troubled students. But she echoed a sentiment expressed by President Trump about the need to address mental health issues, and noted that the suspect in the shooting, Nikolas Cruz, \u201cput up lots and lots of signals and warning signs.\u201d The Education Department has not indicated whether Ms. DeVos would visit Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. In April, she made an unannounced visit to San Bernardino, Calif., shortly after a shooting at North Park Elementary School left one student injured and another student and special education teacher dead. That same day, Mr. Trump delivered an address at the annual convention for the National Rifle Association, which provided at least $30 million in support during his presidential campaign.",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, a lifelong advocate of Christian education, moved on Wednesday to loosen federal regulations on religious colleges and universities, after a Supreme Court decision that restricted states from denying some kinds of aid to religious institutions. The measure is part of a sweeping deregulatory agenda for the Education Department announced on Wednesday by the White House budget office, which outlined several rules and regulations for the department to scrap or amend. Among those are rules that restrict faith-based entities from receiving federally administered funding. \u201cVarious provisions of the department\u2019s regulations regarding eligibility of faith-based entities and activities do not reflect the latest case law regarding religion or unnecessarily restrict religion,\u201d said Liz Hill, an Education Department spokeswoman. \u201cThe department plans to review and to amend such regulations in order to be more inclusive.\u201d Education Department officials appear to be targeting regulations that would pose a legal risk after the Supreme Court ruled in June that states must sometimes provide aid to faith-based organizations. In the decision, Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia Inc. v. Comer, the court ruled that Missouri had engaged in unconstitutional religious discrimination when it denied a church-run preschool publicly funded tire scraps for its playground. Additionally, Attorney General Jeff Sessions released a memo last fall in which he listed 20 principles that should guide agencies in enforcing federal laws. \u201cExcept in the narrowest circumstances, no one should be forced to choose between living out his or her faith and complying with the law,\u201d Mr. Sessions wrote. \u201cTherefore, to the greatest extent practicable and permitted by law, religious observance and practice should be reasonably accommodated in all government activity, including employment, contracting and programming.\u201d The administration may be adopting an expansive interpretation of the Trinity decision. The funding at issue in the decision was for a nonreligious activity. Last week the New Jersey Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the decision did not prohibit New Jersey from denying state aid to repair damaged sanctuaries because that would support religion. That is not stopping Ms. DeVos. The department plans to review regulations, keeping an eye out for provisions that \u201cunnecessarily restrict participation by religious entities\u201d and \u201cto reduce or eliminate unnecessary burdens and restrictions on religious entities and activities,\u201d according to the department\u2019s explanation of its proposals. In the case of religiously affiliated colleges and universities participating in federal student aid programs, the department said that some provisions of the Higher Education Act may be \u201coverly broad in their prohibition of activities or services that relate to sectarian instruction or religious worship,\u201d or \u201cin prohibiting the benefits a borrower may receive based on faith-based activity.\u201d A number of little-known religious prohibitions are cemented in federal law when it comes to higher education and other faith-based entities gaining access to federal funding. For example, regulations prohibit work-study financial aid for work that involves \u201cthe construction, operation or maintenance of any part of a facility used or to be used for religious worship or sectarian instruction.\u201d And a popular grant program called Gear Up, which funds tutors, mentors and other outreach efforts for at-risk youths, prohibits state education departments from pairing with institution that are \u201cpervasively sectarian.\u201d Advocates for religious education cheered the Trinity decision, which they said bolstered the constitutional case for allowing taxpayer funds to pay for vouchers to religious elementary and secondary schools. But few observers saw implications for higher education. Now they do. \u201cWe appreciate Secretary DeVos\u2019s commitment to ensuring students are able to obtain quality educations at the institutions of higher education that will best serve their needs, including religious colleges and universities,\u201d President Shirley V. Hoogstra of the Council for Christian Colleges & Universities said in a statement. \u201cEliminating or revising regulations that impose undue and outdated restrictions on religious institutions is an important and welcome development.\u201d To the chagrin of Democrats and civil rights advocates, religious colleges and universities have made public their decisions to forgo federal funding, usually to be exempt from federal civil rights laws. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely disappointing to see Secretary DeVos doubling down on the Trump administration\u2019s extreme anti-education agenda and is once again considering steps to roll back critical student protections,\u201d Senator Patty Murray, the ranking member on the education committee, said in a statement. Those passing up federal aid include Hillsdale College in Michigan, whose alumni include Ms. DeVos\u2019s brother, Erik Prince, and which has benefited from large donations from the DeVos family. Ms. DeVos, who has repeatedly been questioned about her department\u2019s commitment to defunding religious schools that discriminate, attended Christian schools all of her life and sent her own children to them. In 2016, the Education Department published a database of colleges that received religious exemptions, particularly from rules prohibiting discrimination against gay, lesbian and transgender employees and students. The DeVos administration had continued publishing the database, which lists 61 institutions that have requested exemptions, and has expanded it to include the correspondence between the department and the schools. Advocates of a House Republican bill reauthorizing the Higher Education Act also say they hope to restore First Amendment rights that have been trampled under federal law. Under the House bill, called the Prosper Act, religious colleges would be able to bar same-sex relationships, and religious student groups could ban others who do not share their faith.",

      "author": "Erica L. Green",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 A federal judge has ruled that Education Secretary Betsy DeVos illegally delayed an Obama-era rule that required states to address racial disparities in special education programs. In a decision on Thursday, Judge Tanya S. Chutkan of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia called the Education Department\u2019s delay of the special education rule \u201carbitrary and capricious.\u201d The rule, drafted under the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, would require states to identify districts with \u201csignificant disproportionality\u201d in the number of minority students channeled into special education services, segregated in restrictive classroom settings or disciplined. The rule, passed in the final weeks of the Obama administration, required districts to examine policies and practices that contributed to the disparities and fund remedies. The judge\u2019s ruling vacates Ms. DeVos\u2019s decision to put off the regulation by two years. Instead it will take effect immediately. Leaders in the Education Department said last summer that they needed time to study the rule\u2019s potential consequences because they were concerned that it could promote unconstitutional \u201cracial quotas.\u201d Civil rights groups hailed the ruling as a victory over one of the most significant policy moves that Ms. DeVos has made to date. While the department has rescinded nonbinding guidance documents, which championed Obama-era practices for addressing racial bias, the special education rule is binding, and states had been preparing to enforce it for more than a year. Denise Marshall, executive director for the Council of Parent Attorneys and Advocates, an advocacy organization that sued the department over the delay last year, said the decision, \u201cassures states will be required to help their districts who have historically discriminated against children,\u201d by offering them services rather than suspensions. \u201cThe court has sided with the children whom the department had deemed unimportant through its actions,\u201d Ms. Marshall said. Liz Hill, a spokeswoman for the Education Department, said that the agency was reviewing the ruling and exploring its options. Ms. DeVos delayed the rule after a public comment period in which the overwhelming majority of more than 300 commenters expressed concern that discriminatory practices were denying black and Hispanic students a proper education in a traditional classroom setting, and pushing them out of school to lives on the margins of society or in prison. The department largely sided with the rule\u2019s opponents who believed that large disparities were not evidence enough of discrimination in classrooms, and could be a result of other factors such as districts\u2019 capacity to train teachers in properly identifying and disciplining students with disabilities. It also argued that the rule could have unintended consequences for those same children if districts felt pressure to meet \u201cracial quotas\u201d to avoid being found in violation of the rule. \u201cThe secretary is concerned that the regulations will create an environment where children in need of special education and related services do not receive those services because of the color of their skin,\u201d the department wrote. But Judge Chutkan wrote in her ruling that the department\u2019s concern over racial quotas \u201cdid not have adequate support in the rule-making record.\u201d She wrote that the department failed to show how the safeguards in the Obama-era rule, which expressly prohibited racial quotas, were insufficient. She also found that the department violated the law that governs the promulgation of regulations by failing to provide a \u201creasoned explanation\u201d for delaying the rule and failed to \u201caccount for the costs to children, their parents and society.\u201d Representative Robert C. Scott of Virginia, the chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee and a vocal critic of delaying the rule, said it was \u201ctroubling that the department delayed this critical rule without fulfilling its legal responsibility to provide a rational justification.\u201d \u201cBy forcing the Trump administration to implement the rule, the court\u2019s ruling will put us back on a track toward reversing systemic racial discrimination in education,\u201d Mr. Scott said in a statement. But district leaders might not welcome the news. Among those who supported Ms. DeVos\u2019s delay of the rule was the School Superintendents Association, which represents more than 13,000 superintendents across the country. Under the Obama-era rule, states must apply a standardized methodology, and establish a formula called a \u201crisk ratio,\u201d to identify districts with high levels of disparities. Those found to have wide disparities would be required to set aside 15 percent of their federal funding to examine their policies and take corrective measures. The association wrote in a public comment last year that the new formula stood to impose a significant financial burden on districts found to exceed thresholds, and could further strap already underfunded special education programs. The group wrote that this year, more than 300 districts would save money as a result of the delay. \u201cWithout considerable new financial and technical support from the states, a new requirement for hundreds of districts to address significant disproportionality will either not be fulfilled or will be met with lackluster results,\u201d the School Superintendents Association said.",

      "author": "Erica L. Green",
      "content": " A \u201cbrain-performance\u201d business backed by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has agreed to stop advertising success rates for children and adults suffering from maladies such as attention deficit disorder, depression and autism after a review found the company could not support the outcomes it was promoting. The company, Neurocore, which has received more than $5 million from Ms. DeVos and her husband, Richard DeVos Jr., to run \u201cbrain performance centers\u201d in Michigan and Florida, lost an appeal before an advertising-industry review board, which found that the company\u2019s claims of curbing and curing a range of afflictions without medication were based on mixed research and unscientific internal studies. The National Advertising Review Board, an oversight arm of the advertising industry\u2019s self-regulatory body, announced its decision last week. Neurocore came under scrutiny during Ms. DeVos\u2019s confirmation process, when she valued her stake in it at $5 million to $25 million. Ms. DeVos and her husband were chief investors, and she served on the company\u2019s board of directors for seven years, until her nomination. The New York Times  found that the company\u2019s claims of treating disorders for more than 10,000 adults through \u201cproven neurofeedback therapy\u201d had been challenged by medical experts and insurance companies. After being nominated for education secretary, Ms. DeVos resigned from the board, but in an agreement with the Office of Government Ethics, retained her financial interest in Neurocore. The investment raised ethical concerns for Ms. DeVos after the company expressed hope that it could expand and help improve performance for students in schools. Ms. DeVos said she would \u201cnot participate personally and substantially in any particular matter\u201d concerning the company. But her family has continued to invest. Among the representatives of the company before the National Advertising Review Board was Jason Mahar, the in-house counsel for Windquest Group, the investment management firm of Ms. DeVos\u2019s husband. Windquest also continues to promote the company on its website as part of its \u201ccorporate family.\u201d Greg McNeilly, a spokesman for the DeVos family, said the company was \u201canother example of them being engaged in helping people.\u201d \u201cThey have a very innovative mind-set, so they are always looking for ways to do things better, no matter what the sector or market is,\u201d he said. But the company\u2019s claims of success continue to draw scrutiny. The advertising watchdog panel found that Neurocore did not have sufficient evidence to support a claim that 90 percent of its patients reported fewer symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder following treatments, and that 85 percent experienced \u201cclinically important reduction of symptoms.\u201d Testimonials that the Neurocore program helped patients control anxiety and depression without medication \u201cconveyed strong messages that were not reasonably supported by the record,\u201d the panel wrote. The June 4 decision affirmed a finding announced in August by the advertising industry\u2019s investigative arm, the National Advertising Division, that a slew of Neurocore statistics and testimonials on improving migraines, sleeplessness and A.D.H.D. were based on evidence that was \u201cinsufficiently reliable to substantiate the strong health-related advertising claims.\u201d The company based many of its claims on assessments of patients before and after they completed 30 45-minute sessions watching a movie while connected to brain-wave mapping technology, which detects when a subject gets distracted and then stops the movie. The therapy claims to help retrain the brain to \u201cstop spiking out of range.\u201d The company advertised that through its treatments, patients \u201clearn to breathe deeper and slower,\u201d resulting in better brain and heart function. \u201cWhile the panel recognizes that Neurocore\u2019s internal studies are relevant to the outcome claims discussed below, the panel does not believe that these studies constitute competent and reliable scientific evidence establishing the efficacy of neurofeedback in treating a wide variety of disorders,\u201d the appeals panel wrote in its decision. Neurocore said it would comply with the recommendations to halt its advertisements, though it would still share its outcomes. In an interview, the company\u2019s chief executive officer, Mark Murrison, said that the company had \u201cgreat respect\u201d for the panel, and that recommendations to improve its advertisements were \u201ca win for everybody.\u201d Mr. Murrison said the company believed in its results but was \u201cevolving.\u201d He noted that although the panel did not challenge the accuracy of its results, the company had already discontinued some claims, such as a \u201c25 percent reduction in reported symptoms on the autism evaluation checklists.\u201d \u201cWe believe in our outcomes and will present them in a way that is accurate and in a way that\u2019s compliant with the decision,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are proud we\u2019re able to provide a nondrug option, and anytime you are bringing innovation into a new industry, you\u2019ll be challenged by those who only know the status quo.\u201d Neurocore has boasted in promotional materials that \u201c81 percent of children who come to us on A.D.H.D. meds and complete our program are able to reduce or eliminate their use of medications upon program completion,\u201d and that more that 70 percent of its patients achieved \u201cnonclinical status\u201d for anxiety and depressive symptoms. The appeals panel took particular issue with the company basing its claims of success on internal studies gleaned from surveys of its patients. From these assessments, the company claimed \u201cclinically important\u201d reductions in symptoms, and that patients no longer met \u201csymptomatic thresholds.\u201d The panel believed that such claims were misleading, because they gave the impression that the reduction in symptoms was clinically determined. It said the internal studies were \u201cobservational,\u201d \u201cnot controlled\u201d and \u201cpotentially influenced by experimental bias.\u201d The panel wrote that its decision did not preclude Neurocore from discussing or promoting its assessment data, as long as officials did not imply that patients experienced a significant reduction in symptoms or were cured. It also recommended that the program make clear that patients who take medication for conditions consult with their doctor before discontinuing. Mr. Murrison said that Neurocore still believed in the accuracy of its results, and that the company had had no consumer or competitor complaints. \u201cWhat\u2019s really important to us is that everybody who comes to us for help leave better than when they came,\u201d he said.",

GreenPRINT EDITIONDeVos Avoids a Decision On School Funds for Guns|September 7, 2018, Page A18",
      "author": "Erica L. Green",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has left it to Congress to decide whether states can use federal funds to purchase firearms for their schools, prompting congressional Democrats to begin a last-ditch effort to restrict those funds. Conservatives said Ms. DeVos\u2019s stance was consistent with her championing of local school control. But Democrats and advocates denounced her decision as a tacit endorsement of federally funded firearms in schools, and federal policy experts saw the move as an abdication of the department\u2019s core function to help districts navigate the federal bureaucracy. The Education Department had been considering whether school districts could tap into a $1 billion program intended for academic and enrichment programs after states asked whether school safety measures \u2014 including providing firearms and training \u2014 would be an allowable expense. But Ms. DeVos essentially punted the question back to Congress, which wrote the law that created the program but was silent on firearms purchases. Congressional Democrats are planning to push for language in an end-of-year spending bill that would expressly prohibit the use of grant funds for guns. On the House floor this week, Representative Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, the ranking Democrat on the appropriations subcommittee that funds the Education Department, urged negotiators to say what Ms. DeVos would not. \u201cShe should say that this money is not there for guns in the classrooms,\u201d Ms. DeLauro said. \u201cWe must make the best of a bad situation. We need to ensure we advance the best policy under the circumstances.\u201d In a letter sent to Democratic lawmakers, Ms. DeVos wrote that she had \u201cno intention of taking any action concerning the purchase of firearms or firearms training for school staff\u201d with money allocated in the federal education law, the Every Student Succeeds Act. Ms. DeVos\u2019s response came after a week of public backlash following the revelation that Education Department officials for months had been weighing whether to allow states to use a grant program, called the Student Support and Academic Enrichment Program, or Title IV-A, to purchase guns. Ms. DeVos wrote that while the law allows states \u201csubstantial flexibility\u201d to spend funding aligned with their local needs, \u201cCongress did not authorize me or the department to make those decisions.\u201d Republicans have supported the department\u2019s position that Ms. DeVos\u2019s role is not to adjudicate existing law. But Representative Robert C. Scott of Virginia, who wrote a letter signed by more than 170 House Democrats asking Ms. DeVos to state her intent on the issue, disagreed. On Tuesday, he implored his colleagues to include prohibitions in the spending bill. \u201cIn refusing to act, Secretary DeVos is setting a new and dangerous policy; the secretary is allowing funding to be used to arm teachers,\u201d Mr. Scott said on the House floor. \u201cShe is now also pointing the finger at Congress, calling on us to clarify our intent. But Congress\u2019s intent is already clear.\u201d Meanwhile, states are looking to stay out of the political crossfire in Washington. Texas, which sent the initial inquiry for the Education Department\u2019s consideration, said its state education department was no longer seeking to provide \u201cany guidance to school districts on this issue.\u201d The retreat was not surprising to policy experts who said that local education leaders were being put in a precarious position. They turn to the Education Department for guidance \u2014 or what the department calls \u201ctechnical assistance\u201d \u2014 to ensure that they are meeting program requirements. The Education Department also monitors and audits the spending of federal grant funds, and in instances where they have been found out of compliance, districts have had to return money. \u201cIn not clarifying what is and isn\u2019t acceptable, it becomes harder to implement a program to a standard of success and compliance when you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re being measured against,\u201d said Noelle Ellerson Ng, associate executive director for policy at AASA, the School Superintendents Association, which opposes the use of federal grants for guns. Efforts to add prohibitions in the Education Department\u2019s budget may be an uphill battle, since key Republicans have been cool to the idea that Congress needs to clarify the law. Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, said that the federal grants give \u201cstates, not the U.S. education secretary, authority to spend federal dollars in a way that creates conditions promoting school safety.\u201d A spokeswoman for Representative Virginia Foxx, Republican of North Carolina and chairwoman of the House Education Committee, said that she disagreed that prohibition language should be added. \u201cWe still think the best way to keep kids safe is to empower local school districts to do as they see fit,\u201d she said. More than 40 senators, led by Senator Patty Murray of Washington, also sent Ms. DeVos a letter opposing the idea of allowing states to purchase firearms with the grants. Ms. Murray will also advocate prohibition language in appropriations legislation, a spokeswoman said. Chad Wyen, superintendent of the Mad River school district in Ohio, which gives trained staff members access to firearms, said that so far, he had spent his $82,500 in federal Title IV funding for a teacher, a program that provides drug, alcohol and mental health screenings and treatment for seventh and 12th graders, and \u201ctrauma-informed training.\u201d But he said he would welcome more flexibility to use federal funds for school safety. The school district has a small tax base, one of the lowest per-pupil expenditures in Ohio, and is 80 percent federally and state funded. The district\u2019s start-up costs for its trained \u201cresponse team\u201d was $35,000, which purchased 28 firearms, ammunition, insurance and safes. The recurring costs are about $18,000. \u201cIt would be nice to have more flexibility, because if that could pay for training for response team and range time, that could save me $10,000,\u201d Mr. Wyen said. \u201cIt would certainly be helpful to be a community like ours.\u201d",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Facing a fierce backlash after she called historically black colleges and universities \u201creal pioneers\u201d of school choice, Betsy DeVos, the education secretary, spent Tuesday afternoon backtracking on the controversial statement and highlighting the institutions\u2019 roots in racism and segregation. Ms. DeVos, in a series of Twitter posts on Tuesday and in remarks at a luncheon with presidents from some of the schools, repeatedly acknowledged that the schools were not created simply to give African-American students more choices but because black students across the country were not allowed into segregated white schools. The controversy is the latest gaffe for Ms. DeVos, who has had a rough start. Since Vice President Mike Pence cast the tiebreaking vote to confirm her, Ms. DeVos has fled from a small group of protesters who temporarily blocked her from entering a school, been criticized by a middle school\u2019s administrators for saying their teachers were in \u201creceive mode,\u201d and suffered through the embarrassment of the Education Department misspelling the name of the civil rights icon W.E.B. Du Bois in an official tweet. The latest controversy began on Monday evening when Ms. DeVos released a statement shortly after meeting with several presidents of historically black colleges and universities. In it, Ms. DeVos began by praising the schools for making \u201ctangible, structural reforms\u201d that allowed students, often underserved, to reach their full potential. \u201cThey started from the fact that there were too many students in America who did not have equal access to education,\u201d she said in the statement. \u201cThey saw that the system wasn\u2019t working, that there was an absence of opportunity, so they took it upon themselves to provide the solution.\u201d Historically black colleges and universities \u201care real pioneers when it comes to school choice,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cThey are living proof that when more options are provided to students, they are afforded greater access and greater quality. Their success has shown that more options help students flourish.\u201d On Twitter, hundreds of angry users accused her of ignoring the fact that many of the schools were founded because black students were not allowed to attend segregated white schools, not because education pioneers wanted to give African-Americans more options in higher education. Many accused her of using the nation\u2019s history of segregation to advance a contemporary political agenda. Representative Barbara Lee, Democrat of California, said the comment was \u201ctone deaf.\u201d Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, called the statement \u201ctotally nuts.\u201d Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, was biting. On Tuesday afternoon, Ms. DeVos seemed to backpedal on her statement at a luncheon for the school presidents at the Library of Congress. \u201cBucking that status quo, and providing an alternative option to students denied the right to attend a quality school is the legacy of HBCUs,\u201d she said, according to prepared remarks released by her office. \u201cBut your history was born, not out of mere choice, but out of necessity, in the face of racism, and in the aftermath of the Civil War.\u201d She added that historically black colleges and universities \u201cremain at the forefront of opening doors that had previously been closed to so many,\u201d and that the schools \u201cmade higher education accessible to students who otherwise would have been denied the opportunity.\u201d Ms. DeVos later published several tweets repeating those sentiments in an effort to clear up her earlier comments. Still, Ms. DeVos in her speech referred to Mary McLeod Bethune, a famous civil rights activist and educator, as a leader who \u201cis less well known than others in the HBCU legacy.\u201d Ms. DeVos said Ms. Bethune, who founded Bethune-Cookman University in Daytona, Fla., inspired her because she recognized that traditional school \u201csystemically failed to provide African-Americans access to a quality education \u2014 or, sadly, more often to any education at all.\u201d Ms. DeVos, an aggressive backer of publicly funded vouchers that public school students could use for private school tuition, also used her speech before the presidents of several historically black colleges and universities to highlight school choice programs. She pointed out that her friend and a black woman attending the luncheon, Denisha Merriweather, had been raised by a single mother in poverty, failed the third grade twice, but is now scheduled to graduate in May with a master\u2019s degree because a family member intervened in her life \u201cwith the assistance of a school choice program in Florida.\u201d Ms. DeVos also mentioned an executive order signed by President Trump on Tuesday afternoon dealing with historically black colleges and universities. A White House official said the order was designed to more closely coordinate the White House with efforts to increase funding to the schools and to encourage more private groups and organizations to work with the schools.",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 After spending much of her life fighting for state and local control of education, Betsy DeVos last year found herself at the helm of the federal agency that she had long said stands in the way of educational innovation. But after a year on the job, Ms. DeVos may have learned a hard lesson: local control means she can\u2019t always get what she wants. Ms. DeVos this week upbraided state education chiefs, telling them that while she was obligated to approve their federally mandated state education plans, she was not happy about the way they have used their freedom under the new federal law that governs elementary and secondary education, known as the Every Student Succeeds Act. If the states are supposed to be the laboratories of democracy, Ms. DeVos isn\u2019t seeing much experimentation. But she refuses to violate her principles on states\u2019 rights and tell them what to do. \u201cESSA was enacted partially in response to the widespread calls from state school chiefs \u2014 including many in this room \u2014 to give you the flexibility and opportunity to address your state\u2019s unique challenges,\u201d Ms. DeVos said in an address to the Council of Chief State School Officers. \u201cWell, this law gives you that chance. The trouble, I don\u2019t see much evidence that you\u2019ve yet seized it.\u201d It was the first time that Ms. DeVos has offered her opinions on the quality of state plans under the new law, which freed states from the punitive and prescriptive federal mandates of the George W. Bush-era No Child Left Behind Act. But what Ms. DeVos called \u201ctough love\u201d policy experts and observers called the ultimate display of a frustrated federalist. The address, they said, is an example of a self-described education reformer wrestling with the limits of her influence in an agency whose power she wants to curtail. \u201cI think she\u2019s having an identity problem,\u201d said Sandy Kress, who served as senior education adviser to Mr. Bush on the No Child Left Behind Act. Mr. Kress noted that Ms. DeVos had been critical of her predecessors, calling Mr. Bush\u2019s education law a \u201cstick,\u201d and Barack Obama\u2019s Race to the Top policy, which incentivized state reform with cash, a \u201ccarrot.\u201d But he noted that she had not identified any tool that she would use to effect change in the nation\u2019s schools. \u201cBeing a federalist does not exclude you from the role of leadership,\u201d Mr. Kress said. \u201cShe needs to stand for something, rather than showing up at a place like a regular citizen opining on things.\u201d Michael J. Petrilli, president of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, said he believed that not since the administration of the elder George Bush has an education secretary been a true federalist. That education secretary was Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, who is now a senator. As the chief architect of ESSA, he ensured the \u201clocal control\u201d components of the bill. George W. Bush\u2019s administration was so aggressive in driving education policy that Mr. Bush reset the expectation of conservative leadership in the department, Mr. Petrilli said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been conditioned for the last 30 years to expect a secretary of education to be out front on education reform, using various federal levers,\u201d he said. \u201cBetsy DeVos is trying to lead from behind.\u201d Ms. DeVos\u2019s criticism of the state plans echoed that of several groups that say her office\u2019s implementation of ESSA has been too lax. Democrats and civil rights groups say Ms. DeVos has approved state education plans that do not properly measure the performance of minority students, an allegation she denies. But in her speech, she mentioned the fact that several governors, the majority of them Republican, had refused to sign the plans their states submitted to her office because of what they saw as lackluster achievement goals. \u201cJust because a plan complies with the law doesn\u2019t mean it does what\u2019s best for students,\u201d Ms. DeVos told the chiefs. \u201cWhatever the reasons, I see too many plans that only meet the bare minimum required by the law. Sure, they may pass muster around conference tables in Washington, but the bare minimum won\u2019t pass muster around kitchen tables.\u201d Education chiefs bristled at Ms. DeVos\u2019s assessments, which they saw as painting them with too broad a brush. \u201cAll states are doing far more than Sec. DeVos recognized,\u201d tweeted Matthew Blomstedt, the education commissioner in Nebraska, a state whose governor refused to sign its ESSA plan. \u201cShe delivered a \u2018tough love\u2019 speech that demonstrated why the USDOE is out of touch with the good things actually happening in states and schools.\u201d Policy experts agreed with the substance of the speech, but said it was too little, too late. \u201cShe should look in the mirror,\u201d said Chad Aldeman, a principal at Bellwether Education Partners, a consulting firm that led a group of policy experts in an independent review of plans last year. \u201cThere were several points in time she could have shared her concerns and improved plans.\u201d All plans have been submitted, and 35 have been approved. In announcing the batches of approvals, Ms. DeVos noted only that they complied with the law. Ms. DeVos had signaled unwavering support for the autonomy under the ESSA law, and even issued a pared-down template for states to complete following a vote by Congress last year to rescind regulations that specified accountability measures in the law. But since then, she has not used much of her power over budgets, guidance documents or even a public relations campaign to promote opportunities for innovation and specificity under ESSA, critics say. \u201cShe lowered the bar, they met it, and now she seems frustrated by that,\u201d Mr. Aldeman said. Ms. DeVos told state chiefs that they met the lowest bar \u2014 compliance \u2014 and that many plans fell short of furthering ESSA\u2019s primary goals of innovation in educational programming to lift student achievement, as well as increasing transparency about school performance. For example, she said, only two states, Louisiana and New Mexico, opted into a program that allowed them to use millions in otherwise restricted federal dollars to provide new educational programs, like online courses, for struggling schools. She also said that some states \u201cproposed accountability schemes that were so complicated, schools would be accountable to no one.\u201d In one case, she said, a state \u201ctook a simple concept like a color-coded dashboard and managed to make it nearly indecipherable.\u201d In her speech, Ms. DeVos praised \u201cbright spots,\u201d like Nevada, whose state education chief, Steve Canavero, said he was encouraged by the speech. \u201cThe core message I heard is a message that I continue to hear from the other folks who are in the bleachers of the education space: You have to continually think about ways to innovate, and think about ways to best serve kids,\u201d Mr. Canavero said. Ms. DeVos reiterated that she would not fall into \u201cthe trap of a top-down approach\u201d of her predecessors. \u201cThe Department of Education doesn\u2019t write laws, it implements them,\u201d she said. \u201cCongress did its job. We\u2019re doing ours. And now, you get to do yours.\u201d",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 In a remarkable admission, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos said in a television interview on Sunday that she has not \u201cintentionally\u201d visited public schools in Michigan that are struggling and underperforming. President Trump\u2019s top education advocate was responding to a question during an interview on CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d about whether she had seen the struggling schools in her home state of Michigan, considered among the worst in the country. \u201cI have not \u2014 I have not \u2014 I have not intentionally visited schools that are underperforming,\u201d said Ms. DeVos, a billionaire philanthropist who has pumped millions of dollars into Michigan to promote school choice and vouchers for private and parochial schools. School choice is the centerpiece of Ms. DeVos\u2019s education platform. She has spent most of her professional life fighting for loosening the federal government\u2019s grip on public education while promoting parochial and charter schools in Michigan \u2014 many of which her family has bankrolled. Michigan\u2019s charter school initiatives have not yielded consistently strong results across the state. In a 2016 report by the Education Trust-Midwest, the state\u2019s elementary and secondary school system was among the weakest in the country and continuing to decline. \u201cMichigan schools need to do better. There is no doubt about it,\u201d Ms. DeVos said in the interview. The president recently tapped Ms. DeVos to lead a new Federal Commission on School Safety as part of the Trump administration\u2019s response to deadly mass shootings. Mr. Trump has previously denounced these types of commissions, and as recently as Saturday, Mr. Trump said at a rally that these panels were empty solutions that Washington falls back on instead of fixing problems. In the CBS interview, Ms. DeVos said arming trained teachers \u2014 one of the Trump administration\u2019s plans to prevent school shootings \u2014 is a decision that should be left to states. \u201cEvery state and every community is going to address this issue in a different way,\u201d she said. Asked whether the rhetoric may not lead to action, Ms. DeVos said, \u201cNo, there is a sense of urgency indeed.\u201d",

      "author": "Erica L. Green",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Education Secretary Betsy DeVos announced Monday that she will no longer enforce a provision in federal law that bars religious organizations from providing federally funded educational services to private schools. The move comes after the 2017 Supreme Court decision, Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia Inc. v. Comer, in which the high court found that Missouri had unconstitutionally engaged in religious discrimination when it denied a church-run preschool publicly funded tire scraps for its playground. Ms. DeVos said that after consultation with the Justice Department, education officials determined that a provision in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, the federal law governing the nation\u2019s elementary, middle and high schools, was also unconstitutional. The law calls for students in public and private schools to receive \u201cequitable services,\u201d such as special education, tutoring or mentoring, and allows districts to hire contractors to deliver those services. But the law requires that those contractors be independent of \u201cany religious organization.\u201d \u201cThe Trinity Lutheran decision reaffirmed the long-understood intent of the First Amendment to not restrict the free exercise of religion,\u201d Ms. DeVos said in a statement. \u201cThose seeking to provide high-quality educational services to students and teachers should not be discriminated against simply based on the religious character of their organization.\u201d The Education Department said it would continue to enforce other provisions of the law that require contractors to be independent of a private school and that the services they provide be \u201csecular, neutral and nonideological.\u201d Ms. DeVos sent a letter on Monday to Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the California Democrat, and several other congressional leaders outlining her decision. Democrats said they were reviewing whether the move by Ms. DeVos was legal. \u201cHouse Democrats are carefully reviewing the legality of the administration\u2019s new policy,\u201d said Joshua Weisz, a spokesman for the House Education Committee. Ms. DeVos, who made her announcement at a gathering of state officials for the Council for American Private Education, has signaled that she plans to scrutinize religious restrictions embedded in federal law in light of the Trinity decision. When the decision was announced, she said, \u201cwe should all celebrate the fact that programs designed to help students will no longer be discriminated against by the government based solely on religious affiliation.\u201d Last May, the department announced that it would look to loosen federal regulations on religious colleges and universities in light of the court ruling. And in a speech last spring, Ms. DeVos anticipated that the decision would lead to the demise of state prohibitions called \u201cBlaine Amendments\u201d that prevent taxpayer funding from going to parochial education organizations that provide a public service. The Trump administration has made extending protections to religious organizations a priority. Two years ago, the attorney general at the time, Jeff Sessions, issued guidance to all agency heads asserting that laws \u201cmust not discriminate against religious organizations in their contracting or grant-making activities.\u201d \u201cExcept in the narrowest circumstances, no one should be forced to choose between living out his or her faith and complying with the law,\u201d Mr. Sessions wrote. \u201cTherefore, to the greatest extent practicable and permitted by law, religious observance and practice should be reasonably accommodated in all government activity, including employment, contracting and programming.\u201d",

      "author": "Erica L. Green",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 It pays to be a cause that Education Secretary Betsy DeVos cares about. In the year before Ms. DeVos was nominated for her post, the billionaire philanthropist and her husband poured money into more than 100 organizations across a broad spectrum of causes. The Dick and Betsy DeVos Family Foundation reported $14.3 million in charitable giving, according to 2016 tax filings provided by the organization to The New York Times. The beneficiaries are a diverse group, many aligning with causes the DeVos family has championed: the city of Grand Rapids, publicly funded vouchers for private schools, conservative politics and Christian organizations, low-income children and families, innovation and the arts. A few organizations reflect the more complex picture of Ms. DeVos that has emerged since her rocky nomination process. In accord with her ethics agreement, Ms. DeVos resigned from the foundation the day after she was nominated for secretary of education. Here are the highlights. $3.75 million The Xprize Foundation is a nonprofit that puts on million-dollar global competitions to foster innovation. The organization\u2019s mission statement is to \u201ctransform how people think about the world\u2019s biggest problems and incentivize their solutions.\u201d For example, one Xprize competition was for a team to \u201cautonomously and inconspicuously trigger an emergency alert while transmitting information to a network of community responders, all within 90 seconds.\u201d $3.1 million Anyone who has been to Grand Rapids, Mich., is likely to run into the DeVos name somewhere, whether it be on a street sign or a hospital or a convention center. The amount of donations attached to organizations with a Grand Rapids address last year was about $3.1 million. The foundation also donated to several organizations across the state, including Detroit where the foundation granted $150,000 to grow businesses last year. $750,000 The DeVos Institute of Arts Management at the University of Maryland, College Park, is training the next leaders of cultural institutions, such as museums and galleries, arts schools and libraries, symphonies and cinemas. The institute was named after the DeVos family in 2010 when Ms. DeVos and her husband donated $22.5 million to help the institute expand. $750,000 The Washington-based research organization is often a conservative voice on a range of political and educational issues. However, fellows there have criticized the recent expansion of 529 plans to pay for private-school tuition, and several scholars there have been highly critical of President Trump. $650,000 This Illinois-based Christian leadership organization was a big beneficiary of foundation funding. The organization\u2019s mission is to develop Christian leaders, and its mission of \u201chelping Christians grow their leadership to maximize Kingdom impact.\u201d This echoes Ms. DeVos\u2019s own stated life\u2019s mission to \u201cexpand God\u2019s Kingdom,\u201d a principle shaped by her Calvinist upbringing. The collection plate at the DeVoses\u2019 home church runneth over. Last year, the Foundation donated $350,000 to the Mars Hill Bible Church, where Ms. DeVos has been a member and an elder for years. $600,000 What They Do: Potter\u2019s House, an urban, Christian school that DeVos has supported for nearly 30 years, serves predominantly poor, minority students in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Ms. DeVos has referenced Potter\u2019s House in numerous interviews and speeches as having inspired her to advocate for low-income families to have more educational choices. Ms. DeVos sponsors tuition for entire classes at the school. $350,000 The DeVoses are known to be very generous to Grand Rapids Christian High School, the alma mater of their four children. Often criticized for sending her children to private schools, Ms. DeVos told The Times that she chose Grand Rapids Christian because she wanted to continue her family\u2019s tradition of educating her children in Christian-based schools. But she also wanted her children to be educated in a more diverse setting than they would have had in the public schools of the wealthy suburb of Ada, Mich., where the family lives. The DeVoses also gave $55,000 to the Ada Christian School Society. $150,000 The New York-based charter school chain is among the most high-profile in the nation, and its leader Eva Moskowitz is arguably as controversial as Ms. DeVos herself. Ms. Moskowitz\u2019s recent book lends insight into the reform movement that self-described reformers like Ms. DeVos have championed. Ms. Moskowitz praised Ms. DeVos\u2019s nomination for secretary. $400,000 The DeVos Foundation invested in the company, co-founded by former television journalist Campbell Brown, that describes itself as a nonpartisan education news site. Its namesake is the 74 million children in America that will receive an education. Ms. Brown wrote an opinion piece about Ms. DeVos\u2019s nomination, calling out inaccurate claims on social media that led to Ms. DeVos being \u201cmisleadingly caricatured.\u201d $290,000 Several organizations that Ms. DeVos was connected to in her advocacy work received donations. Among them is the Alliance for School Choice, also known as the American Federation for Children, an organization that Ms. DeVos chaired before her nomination. Other school choice advocacy organizations on the list include the Great Lakes Education Foundation, which received $200,000. Jeb Bush\u2019s Foundation for Excellence in Education received $52,000. Ms. DeVos was a keynote speaker at the Foundation\u2019s national conference earlier this month. Amount Donated: $20,000 What They Do: The organization provides a range of services for pregnant women, including ultrasounds and testing for sexually transmitted diseases. But also featured prominently on the organization\u2019s website is an option for \u201cMy Choices\u201d and \u201cAbortion Information.\u201d Liberal leaning organizations have accused the resource center of advertising the abortion clinic as a way to talk pregnant women out of the procedure. But the organization provides a lot of information on them, including how to help families through them and referrals for where they can be performed. The resource center is certainly no Parent Parenthood \u2014 and it makes clear that it would like women to exhaust their choices before choosing abortion. But it\u2019s also a stark contrast to the Right to Life of Michigan Educational Foundation, which received $25,000 from the Foundation. Its take on abortions: \u201cSome choices aren\u2019t worthy of a woman.\u201d Amount Donated: $35,000 The institute files and funds a variety of civil liberties lawsuits, including several defending school voucher and tax credit programs that help fund private school tuition. Amount Donated: $155,000 The research organization describes its mission as the promotion of \u201ca free and virtuous society characterized by individual liberty and sustained by religious principles.\u201d It also publishes a journal. Amount Donated: $305,000 The traditional Boy Scouts of America is undergoing its own evolution, admitting girls in the next two years. $201,000 What They Do: The Christian-based organization helps the homeless in the town where Ms. DeVos was born and raised. It offers a \u201cwide range of Christ-driven services that address the root issues of homelessness to help restore and transform lives,\u201d according to its website. The DeVos family funds dozens of organizations that help low-income families, and features prominently on its website the Inner City Christian Federation, which builds affordable housing in Grand Rapids. $235,000 Kids Hope USA organization pairs church members with at-risk kids, and it was Ms. DeVos\u2019s door into the Grand Rapids Public School, where she served as a mentor for several years. It was through the program that she met a young woman named Angie a decade ago, who she still mentors today. Angie told The New York Times in May that it was difficult to watch Ms. DeVos be criticized in the media for not caring about people. $25,000 The Georgia-based organization\u2019s mission is to support Christian families that have lesbian, gay, bisexual or transsexual children. The organization\u2019s mission is to \u201chelp reconcile the LGBTQ community and their families, while helping them move closer to Jesus Christ where they can experience healing and personal growth.\u201d The organization is run by a couple who said they have \u201cimmersed themselves in the LGBTQ community,\u201d since learning their son was gay 15 years ago. Their goal is to \u201cembrace their journey and encourage them to love their children well,\u201d according to their website. $30,000 The DeVos family helped to fund a little-known humanitarian effort to defeat the Islamic State, or ISIS \u2014 run largely out of a Brooklyn apartment. The Heraion Foundation, known as HERA, is a veteran-run nonprofit organization that started in 2015 to bring \u201ca new full-spectrum approach to counter-extremist humanitarianism. A profile of the group said that when its founder was not on the ground in Iraq, he worked out of his apartment.",

      "author": "Erica L. Green",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 If there was any school where her daughter would feel safe, Michelle Hoffman thought, it would be Holland Christian High School. Betsy DeVos, the famously religious education secretary, was educated there, and the school preached that its students would seek \u201cin all endeavors to \u2018do justice, love kindness, and walk humbly with their God.\u2019\u201d But after her 15-year-old was sexually assaulted by her 17-year-old boyfriend, another student at the school, Ms. Hoffman realized how misplaced that confidence was. Instead of helping, the school\u2019s principal called the assault \u201cunderage sex\u201d and told her the school was \u201cnot taking sides.\u201d An ensuing lawsuit filed by Ms. Hoffman against Holland Christian has turned Ms. DeVos\u2019s private alma mater in Holland, Mich., into Exhibit A as the secretary moves to overhaul the law that governs school sexual assault \u2014 and to bolster the rights of the accused while narrowing the responsibilities that schools have to investigate sexual misconduct. The Holland case lays bare some of the biggest concerns about Ms. DeVos\u2019s proposals for Title IX \u2014 the 1972 law prohibiting sex discrimination in educational programs that receive federal funding. On Tuesday, the Senate Education Committee will hold a hearing on responding to sexual assault on college campuses. But Title IX also applies to primary and secondary schools \u2014 like Holland Christian. \u201cWe pray that ours can be the case that makes Betsy say, \u2018maybe this isn\u2019t the right way to go,\u2019\u201d Ms. Hoffman said. Ms. DeVos\u2019s proposed regulations have garnered more than 105,000 public comments, making Title IX one of the most contentious rules in the department\u2019s history. Her efforts to strengthen the due-process rights for accused students have been assailed by victims rights advocates as gutting protections for those who have been assaulted, harassed or raped. The particulars of the sexual misconduct asserted in the Holland case are no longer in dispute. In a text message, the boyfriend revealed that the Hoffman\u2019s daughter did not like \u201cthe way that I\u2019ve raped you.\u201d He pleaded guilty to a third-degree criminal sexual conduct charge, and a judge ordered him off the Holland Christian premises. Ms. Hoffman said that Holland Christian not only failed to properly investigate her daughter\u2019s assault and to protect her from her perpetrator, but also went to great lengths to protect the male student. The suit described how the school rallied around the boy, who Ms. Hoffman said was the grandson of a former Holland Christian principal. The suit charged that those actions were in large part because Holland Christian failed to have Title IX processes in place, despite receiving hundreds of thousands of dollars from the U.S. Department of Agriculture through its participation in the National School Lunch Program \u2014 a little-known avenue through which private schools can skirt enforcement of federal civil rights laws while taking taxpayer dollars. \u201cThis case should be a wake-up call for both private and public school families,\u201d said Esther Warkov, executive director of Stop Sexual Assault in Schools, a nonprofit organization that publicized the lawsuit. \u201cWhen the U.S. Secretary of Education\u2019s own alma mater flouts its responsibilities we begin to understand the pervasive disregard for Title IX compliance that includes the majority of public schools nationwide,\u201d she said. The lawsuit, filed in April 2018, charges that the school violated guidelines issued under the Obama administration, which were in place at the time the assault was brought to Holland officials\u2019 attention. The rules required schools to investigate sexual assaults that took place off campus and take steps to protect accusers from their accused while an investigation unfolded. In 2017, before the Hoffman lawsuit was filed, Ms. DeVos announced that she would scrap the Obama-era guidelines and rewrite the law. She proposed new rules last fall. The Obama administration\u2019s guidance drew wide-ranging criticism, including from college administrators, as arbitrary edicts that pressured colleges to conduct quasi-legal processes with a presumed outcome in favor of victims. And in the last year, significant court rulings  have aligned with Ms. DeVos\u2019s efforts to provide a firmer legal framework for campus investigations. The case, expected to go to mediation or a courtroom this summer, asserts that the Hoffman\u2019s daughter suffered \u201csevere and pervasive\u201d sexual harassment that denied her access to her education. It argues that school administrators had \u201cactual knowledge\u201d of the assault, meaning that it was reported to officials with the authority to take action, and that the school was \u201cdeliberately indifferent\u201d in its response. Ms. DeVos has proposed to adopt the \u201csevere and pervasive\u201d standard for sexual harassment, along with legal standards that would hold school administrators responsible only if they had \u201cactual knowledge\u201d of sexual misconduct and were \u201cdeliberately indifferent.\u201d Those standards are based on Supreme Court precedent and used in Title IX court cases already. But in administrative hearings, they would significantly raise the bar for holding schools liable for addressing misconduct compared with looser processes outlined by the Obama administration. The new rules preserve some longstanding Title IX requirements, including schools\u2019 obligation to have a Title IX coordinator and an established investigative process. They also outline new \u201csupportive measures\u201d for victims, even if they do not file complaints. They would, however, eliminate an Obama-era requirement that held schools liable for incidents that occur off campus and outside of a school-sponsored program or activity \u2014 a change that, had it been in place, would have technically alleviated Holland Christian of its obligation to respond to the claim. Holland Christian does not receive funding from the Education Department, which enforces Title IX in schools and colleges that participate in programs it administers, but court cases suggest that it is still bound by the rules that apply to all education programs that receive federal funding. In 2010 case, a federal judge ruled that a Pennsylvania Catholic High School was required to follow Title IX because it received funding for meals and technology. The Hoffmans\u2019 lawsuit said that the Holland Christian had received more than $600,000 in federal funding through its participation in the National School Lunch Program, which reimburses schools for serving free or reduced-price meals. Currently, 4,700 private schools nationwide participate in the program according to Agriculture Department officials. All schools that participate in the voluntary program are required to comply with federal civil rights laws, department officials said. But experts and advocates say there is little way of knowing if private schools actually are aware of their legal obligations \u2014 or care. \u201cThis case has unearthed this whole set of protections that haven\u2019t really been talked about, and that parents and private schools don\u2019t know exist,\u201d said Seth Galanter, director of legal advocacy at the National Center for Youth Law, who worked in the Education Department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights under former President Barack Obama. The Hoffmans initially turned to the Education Department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights, which dismissed their complaint in July 2017, citing lack of jurisdiction. The Hoffmans learned months later, as they prepared to file a lawsuit, that the complaint should have been filed with the Department of Agriculture. Unlike the Education Department, the Agriculture Department has enforcement power in private schools, but Title IX investigations in schools participating in the National School Lunch Program are rare. Officials said in recent years, the department\u2019s office for civil rights has only investigated one such complaint. The agency declined to answer any other questions about its civil rights investigations. For decades, Title IX enforcement in private schools has been contentious. A 1984 Supreme Court decision, Grove City College vs. Bell, held that Title IX only applied to a specific program, not the institution, that received federal funding. In response, Congress passed the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987, which clarified that anti-discrimination laws applied institutionwide. President Ronald Reagan vetoed the bill, and Congress overrode it. Private schools are allowed to request religious exemptions from civil rights laws that conflict with their religious tenets. But Agriculture Department officials said they have not received any exemption requests in recent years from schools participating in the National School Lunch Program, including Holland Christian. In its response, Holland Christian overwhelmingly denied the allegations. The school admitted, however, that it did not have a formal Title IX process. Gary P. Bartosiewicz, the lawyer representing Holland Christian declined to comment on Ms. Hoffman\u2019s allegations, saying only that the school \u201cwill continue its defense of both the legal and factual allegations in this litigation.\u201d Karen Truszkowski, a Michigan lawyer who is representing the Hoffman family, also declined to comment on the case. But she said, \u201cWe\u2019re at a real crossroads and Title IX is the accountability measure to ensure adults are protecting children.\u201d In the lawsuit, Ms. Hoffman said that after her daughter\u2019s assault was revealed in the 2016-17 school year, she was in constant communication with Holland officials about her concerns, and that the principal and superintendent \u2014 who both have left the district since the suit was filed \u2014 did nothing. Ms. Hoffman said she asked for her daughter and the boy to see each other as little as possible. The lawsuit said the girl was forced to see him in the hallways and in choir class, and he once brushed up against her. \u201cHe kept in proximity to her and made sure she was aware of it,\u201d the lawsuit said. As a result of the interactions, it claimed, the girl was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety, and she missed school because of \u201coverwhelming emotional crisis.\u201d Ms. Hoffman said that the school also failed to accommodate her daughter\u2019s desire to enjoy school, but went out of its way to make sure the male student could. When she expressed that her daughter was having academic difficulty, the principal said the girl\u2019s grades \u201cseemed fine,\u201d according to the suit. But after the male student was barred from attending classes, the school sent teachers to his home to tutor him so that he could finish his senior year, the suit said. At his sentencing, several Holland Christian teachers wrote to the judge asking for leniency, because he was a \u201cgood kid,\u201d the suit said. No such letters were written for the Hoffmans\u2019 daughter, the suit said, and the girl \u201chad to face each day knowing that authority figures at her school supported her rapist, and not her.\u201d Ms. Hoffman said she hopes that her case can help ensure that victims are treated differently under the new rules. \u201cWe do recognize that Title IX is not perfect,\u201d she said, \u201cbut her changes will definitely be taking a step back.\u201d",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 It\u2019s been a year, but the air is still frigid between the education secretary, Betsy DeVos, and the leaders of the nation\u2019s teacher unions. Randi Weingarten, the longtime president of the American Federation of Teachers, and Lily Eskelsen Garc\u00eda, the president of the National Education Association, were left out in the cold on Thursday as they tried to deliver 80,000 failing \u201creport cards\u201d to Ms. DeVos from educators across the country. The union leaders found locked doors as they tried to enter the Department of Education building to offer their assessment of Ms. DeVos\u2019s first year on the job. Ms. Weingarten said the department had been asked for an appointment and knew that the group of about 100 protesters was coming. The department said guards had barred the group because it did not have an appointment. Among the educators\u2019 chief concerns, Ms. Eskelsen Garc\u00eda said, is Ms. DeVos\u2019s education budget, which calls for $9 billion in cuts, and the department\u2019s rollback of protections for disabled students. In the report cards, parents and educators leveled criticisms like \u201ceducation is not and should not be treated as a business,\u201d and \u201cMs. DeVos should think about the children whose lives she is making infinitely harder with her actions.\u201d In a video posted by the American Federation of Teachers, the crowd arrived at the Education Department with boxes in hand \u2014 the one Ms. Weingarten was holding had a report card with a large red \u201cF\u201d scrawled across it \u2014 and tried several locked doors. \u201cThis is a remarkable moment,\u201d Ms. Weingarten told the crowd, adding of the department: \u201cThey knew that teachers and parents and students from all over the country have actually taken their time to say what is going on in their schools. And here on Betsy DeVos\u2019s anniversary, this is the first time that I have ever been to this building where we were not let in \u2014 where the educators, where the students, where the parents of America were locked out of the federal Department of Education.\u201d Liz Hill, a spokeswoman for the department, dismissed the protest as theatrics. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that instead of working to have productive dialogue, the unions decided it was important to pull teachers out of the classroom for a two-hour political publicity stunt \u2014 for which they shot their own footage to send to media outlets,\u201d Ms. Hill said. She added that the department had followed a longstanding security protocol, which union officials were aware of from their days protesting President Barack Obama\u2019s education secretary, Arne Duncan. \u201cTheir leaders should know that no one can get in without an appointment,\u201d Ms. Hill said. \u201cIf they would like to send a representative to the department to deliver their feedback, we\u2019d be happy to accept it.\u201d Despite a strained relationship, Ms. DeVos and Ms. Weingarten had a short meeting of the minds in the spring, when they toured schools together in Van Wert, Ohio. Ms. Eskelsen Garc\u00eda said the only communication she had had with Ms. DeVos was when she sent her a letter and received a voice mail message in return. \u201cIt\u2019s her actions that speak louder than any talking points she may have,\u201d Ms. Eskelsen Garc\u00eda said in an interview. \u201cPeople are universally appalled, universally aghast by a year of failures. She should resign; she should make way for someone who is qualified.\u201d Ms. DeVos is the only cabinet secretary whose security detail includes United States marshals, and she has reportedly received more threats than other education secretaries. She has been met with protests in her travels around the country, and last February, she was nearly knocked down when she was blocked from entering a school in Washington by a handful of protesters. The group that gathered on Thursday debated leaving the boxes of report cards outside the department, but Ms. Eskelsen Garc\u00eda expressed concern that doing so would be seen as a bomb threat. Union officials said they would try again to deliver the boxes.",

GreenPRINT EDITIONA Struggle To Punish Sex Assault In Schools|May 12, 2019, Page A26",
      "author": "Erica L. Green",
      "content": " WINCHESTER, Va. \u2014 Nausea had consumed her as her attacker pinned her arms down at a park, forced her first kiss upon her, and tried to take off her pants at the tender age of 14, and nausea resurfaced every time she saw him in the hallways of her high school. For a year, the girl had tried to convey the lingering trauma of the attack to disbelieving school officials as they investigated her claims. Then over the summer, they brought her to a conference room at the Winchester Public Schools building to watch a surveillance tape in which she was seen zigzagging in and out of hallways trying to avoid him and seek help. She thought she had made a breakthrough. Weeks later, the district issued its final report. Among its findings: She could not possibly be in distress because in one segment, she had smiled minutes after she saw her attacker. \u201cThat\u2019s when I realized that instead of investigating my complaint, they were investigating me,\u201d the girl, now 15, said in an interview. Efforts by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos to overhaul federal rules on sexual misconduct have focused public attention on college campuses, where assault, rape and harassment have made headlines for years. But her efforts to change those rules, put into place more protections for the accused and offer relief for educational institutions have prompted concerns from elementary and secondary school leaders, public school superintendents and other educators that highlight how schools grapple with sexual misconduct involving much younger students. The new rules would apply to any elementary and secondary school district that receives government funding, hundreds of which \u2014 like Winchester \u2014 are already under investigation by the department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights over claims of violating Title IX, the 47-year federal law to prevent sex discrimination in education. And where universities have procedures and adjudication processes that might need changing to comply with the new rules, elementary and secondary schools have been found to have no rules at all for dealing with sexual misconduct. The Education Department is currently investigating 652 complaints of Title IX violations related to sexual harassment and violence, 279 of which are against K-12 schools. \u201cIt\u2019s like the Wild West,\u201d said Adele P. Kimmel, a senior lawyer at Public Justice, a legal watchdog group. \u201cK-12 schools are light years behind colleges.\u201d The nation\u2019s 98,000 public elementary and secondary schools educate 50 million children \u2014 nearly triple the number of young adults in colleges, universities and other postsecondary education facilities. And K-12 schools \u2014 often unaware of their obligations under federal law \u2014 have become notorious for failing to recognize and address sexual assault, and employing tactics to intimidate victims and avoid lawsuits. \u201cAcross the country we still sit in the bad old days where K-12 school administrators can convince themselves and persist in the belief that they do not have Title IX responsibility,\u201d said Catherine E. Lhamon, who led the Education Department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights under the Obama administration and investigated a sharp rise in Title IX complaints concerning sexual violence in elementary and secondary schools. Under the Trump administration\u2019s proposed regulations, schools would be expected to recognize complaints under Title IX only where harassment is \u201csevere and pervasive,\u201d and could decline to investigate claims that happen off campus or outside the school\u2019s programming. The rules would no longer explicitly define how schools should address a \u201chostile environment\u201d for accusers. The department is processing more than 100,000 comments submitted on the proposed regulations. Among them are those from groups representing K-12 principals, superintendents and school boards, all opposing the rules, which they say could further tie their hands in how they respond to sexual assault complaints from a vulnerable population. \u201cTitle IX compliance is challenging in the K-12 space,\u201d said Sasha Pudelski, the advocacy director at AASA, the School Superintendents Association, \u201cbut nothing in these proposed regulations will make those challenges go away.\u201d Under the proposed rules, the Winchester Public Schools district would not have been obligated to investigate the girl\u2019s complaint at all, since she said the assault happened off campus. The girl\u2019s mother, Danielle Bostick, said that even though the boy pleaded no contest to misdemeanor sexual battery and felony abduction and agreed to a protective order, the school denied the family\u2019s claims of assault and of a hostile environment. The New York Times does not identify victims of sexual assault; the girl\u2019s mother, who has a different last name, has spoken out about the case. The school devised a plan to minimize contact between Ms. Bostick\u2019s daughter and the accused, but her requests that they have zero contact and that he ultimately be removed from the school were rebuffed. After losing two Title IX appeals, the girl transferred to a private school nearly an hour away. The Virginia state legislature recently passed a bill named after her that would protect students with protective orders in school. \u201cEvery choice those adults made was devastating to her,\u201d said Ms. Bostick, who teaches Latin at the school. \u201cThere was nothing we could do, nothing we could show that would make them have compassion for her. The proposed changes would make our nightmare the new standard.\u201d Jason Van Heukelum, the superintendent for the school district, said its conclusion was based on two exhaustive weekslong investigations that included reviewing nearly 1,300 pages of documents and conducting 17 interviews. \u201cWe go to great lengths to afford our students and staff protections from the violation and the fear of assault and harassment in our schools,\u201d he said. Though colleges get the attention, it was a K-12 case that spurred the Supreme Court to expand the law to include student-on-student assaults. In 2016, the Obama administration issued guidance to K-12 schools as part of its overhaul of campus rules on sexual assault. The administration had seen a jump in sexual violence complaints in K-12 systems, to 83 in 2016 from 11 in 2009. Even then, advocates and civil rights officials believed those numbers were grossly underreported, because school districts failed to recognize when children were articulating sexual harassment. \u201cIf you don\u2019t recognize sexual violence, you\u2019re going to perpetuate it,\u201d Ms. Kimmel said. The Obama administration\u2019s investigations into K-12 systems revealed some of the most egregious violations, Ms. Lhamon said. She said the civil rights office often encountered a \u201cschool\u2019s insistence that they didn\u2019t need to have standards because students shouldn\u2019t be having sex.\u201d The Trump administration is trying to standardize proceedings that align with processes that court rulings have affirmed. And it has continued to aggressively pursue investigations and resolution agreements with K-12 school districts. Last year, the administration  withheld millions of dollars in funding from Chicago Public Schools after The Chicago Tribune found that the school system had covered up rampant sexual abuse by students and staff members. Colleges and universities have fretted that bolstered rights for the accused under Ms. DeVos\u2019s draft rules would force them to set up the equivalent of courtrooms, complete with prosecutors, defense lawyers and cross-examinations. But advocates say the Education Department should be cautious about how the rules would overhaul procedures in K-12 schools. In a letter to the department, Public Justice said the proposed rules would \u201chobble Title IX enforcement, placing a premium on protecting schools from legal liability instead of protecting students from harm,\u201d and cement some of the worst practices already employed in K-12 proceedings. For instance, the proposals call for \u201ca live hearing\u201d during which accusers and accused students would be questioned with the goal of challenging each other\u2019s credibility. Schools could choose to use a higher evidentiary standard than is required in civil court cases. And they would be in violation of the law only if they had done nothing to address the misconduct, or acted with \u201cdeliberate indifference,\u201d regardless of the process or outcome. Public Justice is representing several clients across the country who say that a lack of procedures have led school districts to botch investigations and violate students\u2019 rights under Title IX. In a lawsuit against Gwinnett County Public Schools in suburban Atlanta, a high school sophomore said she was punished after she reported that she was forced to perform oral sex on a male student. A staff member who helped lead the investigation said, \u201cI don\u2019t know that I\u2019m trained to qualify what is sexual assault,\u201d the suit said. The investigation required her to re-enact the episode. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you bite his penis?\u201d a school resource officer asked her, according to the suit. During a disciplinary hearing, the girl was cross-examined by the accused student\u2019s lawyer, who had to be told to \u201ctone it down.\u201d A lawyer for the school district also questioned the girl, concluding that he believed the encounter was consensual because she \u201cdid not scream louder and louder as this was going on.\u201d Found to have violated the sexual misconduct policy, the girl was suspended \u2014 twice. A county spokeswoman referred to the district\u2019s motion to dismiss the lawsuit, in which it argued the school district did not violate Title IX because it investigated and determined the sex was consensual. In another case, parents are suing the Washington Public Schools in Oklahoma, where they say their middle-school son had been assaulted three times over 18 months by his male peers, who shoved their fingers in his rectum in a classroom and locker room. Administrators called it \u201chorseplay\u201d but admitted they would have called the police if the same action had been done to a girl. When the parents asked the administrators to take action, the principal, who was also the athletic director, asked, \u201cWhat do you want me to do \u2014 hold his hand?\u201d County officials did not respond to a request for comment. Jesse Binnall, a lawyer representing an accused student in a Title IX lawsuit against Fairfax County Schools in Virginia, said that there are even fewer due process protections at the K-12 level than in college, but school disciplinary decisions are more consequential for younger students. \u201cThis isn\u2019t something you learn from and move on; this is almost worse than a felony conviction,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to put something on somebody\u2019s record, something that\u2019s going to haunt them for the rest of their lives, you\u2019d better be sure.\u201d In Mr. Binnall\u2019s suit, an 18-year-old male student says the school district violated his rights when he was suspended after a girl accused him of hitting her buttocks. The suit said the student had little notice to prepare a defense in a disciplinary hearing and was not able to question the accuser or the witnesses. The suit also contends that school officials ignored key evidence, and even though video evidence exonerated him and a witness recanted, they did not waive their decision. Officials in Fairfax County Schools, which is facing at least one other Title IX lawsuit, declined to comment on pending litigation. In 2014, the district settled an investigation with the Office for Civil Rights, which required it to improve its Title IX process. A spokesman said the district was complying with its federal agreement and federal laws and was \u201ccommitted to continually improving our practices related to preventing and responding to sex discrimination within our schools.\u201d For students like his client, Mr. Binnall said, Ms. DeVos\u2019s new rules could be a step in the right direction. They outline extensive due process requirements that schools should follow, including proper notice to allow students to prepare for hearings, and providing equal opportunity to present witnesses and review evidence. \u201cIt\u2019s not that we have to have full courtroom procedures,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to have procedures in place that make it so that some sort of teenage vendetta doesn\u2019t completely ruin the lives of an innocent student. And that\u2019s what\u2019s really lacking at all levels right now, especially the K-12 level.\u201d",

GreenPRINT EDITIONAn Ally of For-Profit Schools Returns to the Education Dept., With Plans|June 10, 2019, Page A16",
      "author": "Erica L. Green",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Depending on whom you ask, Diane Auer Jones has returned to the Education Department with either a mission or a vengeance. A little more than a decade ago she resigned as an assistant secretary for postsecondary education in the George W. Bush administration, after protesting the department\u2019s treatment of an accreditor that oversaw religiously affiliated, liberal-arts colleges. Department officials saw accountability in their crackdown; Ms. Jones saw bias against a gatekeeper for nontraditional college degrees. \u201cFavored accreditors are treated differently than unfavored accreditors,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cThat was my awakening to how the current system could be manipulated to pick winners and losers.\u201d Now, as the chief architect of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos\u2019s higher education agenda, Ms. Jones is leading the charge to overhaul the accreditation system, and, to critics, revive the fortunes of for-profit organizations that operate low-quality education programs that have a track record of shortchanging students and taxpayers. The fact that Ms. Jones went on to work for some of those institutions after she resigned has made her perhaps the most controversial appointee at the Education Department. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s Department of Education is stacked with former for-profit executives whose companies got rich by ripping students off,\u201d said Charisma L. Troiano, the press secretary for Democracy Forward, a government watchdog organization that has accused Ms. Jones of several conflicts of interest. \u201cFor decades, Diane Auer Jones has advocated for this predatory industry.\u201d Ms. Jones has proposed a significant rewrite of rules that would loosen the federal government\u2019s reins on accreditors, largely invisible but critical watchdogs whose stamp of approval serves as an education institution\u2019s lifeline to millions of dollars in financial aid. The rules would make it easier for accreditors to be recognized by the Education Department to oversee institutions, and afford them more flexibility in how they manage programs. They would also relax departmental standards for measuring accreditors\u2019 performance, and potentially allow them to take years to penalize troubled schools. The rules would strengthen the role that accreditors have in preventing abrupt school closures, and extend federal funding to troubled schools longer to allow students to make other plans. The new regulations are expected to be published as early as this week for public comment. The rules would deliver on Ms. DeVos\u2019s promise to deregulate higher education to foster innovation and competition among institutions, particularly for-profit colleges and career-education programs, that serve a vast and diverse population. For Ms. Jones, they also reflect unfinished business. After she left the department, she joined the board of the American Academy for Liberal Education, the religious-school accreditor that prompted her resignation, where she railed against the Education Department\u2019s accreditation process. In the Trump administration, she has found exoneration. When the accreditation rule-making session ended, with negotiators reaching a rare consensus, in April she popped champagne in the negotiating room. She trumpeted that the rules cut down on \u201cbureaucratic minutiae that distracts institutions from students.\u201d Consumer protection advocates see the rules as part of a larger plan to allow Ms. Jones\u2019s allies in the for-profit industry to proliferate and operate with few guardrails. Some of the proposals reflect wish lists that for-profit and career schools have lobbied for in Congress. They throw a safety net to accreditors and programs that have struggled to meet departmental standards. \u201cThe proposed regulations cut any serious oversight of colleges off at the knees,\u201d said Clare McCann, the deputy director for federal policy at New America, a policy research group. \u201cBottom-feeder colleges will be able to keep enrolling students and pulling in taxpayer dollars for years, and it will be nearly impossible for the Education Department to take action against failing accreditors.\u201d Some higher education experts have been supportive but cautious. Terry Hartle, a vice president at the American Council on Education, an association representing more than 1,700 colleges and universities and related organizations, said the accreditation rules were \u201cimportant, incremental movements\u201d that have been long desired by a range of institutions. He served on the committee of department-appointed negotiators, including department officials and consumer protection and higher education representatives, and said the rules would allow high-quality institutions to experiment in new ways. Mr. Hartle, who has known Ms. Jones for more than a decade, said he believed allegations that the rules were designed to benefit flailing for-profits was an \u201ceasy answer.\u201d \u201cDiane is extremely knowledgeable and she\u2019s always been a professional,\u201d he said. What opponents and proponents can agree on is that none of the changes are as contentious as Ms. Jones herself. As principal deputy under secretary at the Education Department, Ms. Jones is seen as the mastermind behind Ms. DeVos\u2019s most criticized decisions, including the rollback of two major Obama-era regulations that sought to protect students from predatory practices by for-profit institutions. She also recommended the reinstatement of a scandal-plagued accreditor, Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools, known as A.C.I.C.S., which the Obama administration sought to banish after the collapse of two for-profit chains, ITT Technical Institute and Corinthian Colleges, which were under its supervision. The decision prompted Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, to call Ms. Jones a \u201cformer for-profit college lackey.\u201d In an interview, Ms. Jones rejected such characterizations and said she took her cues from Ms. DeVos. \u201cWhen you have a bold leader, that emboldens you to do the right thing,\u201d she said, \u201ceven when it means bad press, even when it means an ugly tweet.\u201d Although her ethics forms have been cleared, Ms. Jones has frustrated advocates and Democrats by repeatedly rejecting their calls to recuse herself from policymaking that could benefit her former employers. In addition to serving on the board of the American Academy for Liberal Education, she was also an executive at Career Education Corporation \u2014 where she lobbied against the regulations she is seeking to revise. The company is one of the largest for-profit operators in the nation and settled multistate, yearslong investigations over accusations that it misled students with inflated job-placement rates. The majority of the company\u2019s campuses were accredited by the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools. Ms. Jones said she is not concerned with making the company money. She was the one who reported the improprieties found at its schools to the schools\u2019 accreditor and the Education Department, she said. The corporation\u2019s financial records show it lost millions during her tenure. Ms. Jones\u2019s recommendation to reinstate the accrediting council, which is now struggling financially, is under investigation by the Education Department\u2019s inspector general. This week, students from Virginia College, a chain of for-profit schools, sued Ms. DeVos saying that the reinstatement led to their colleges\u2019 demise. She denies allegations that there was anything nefarious behind the decision to reinstate the accrediting council, which was prompted by a judge ordering the department to review the Obama administration\u2019s decision to banish the accreditor. Ms. Jones answered bluntly when asked why she refused to recuse herself from the decision to avoid perceived conflicts: \u201cIt was my job. There are only a few of us at the department who know accreditation as well as I do.\u201d While Ms. Jones\u2019s motivations are often pegged to her five years in the for-profit sector, she said they were more inspired by her last two years of high school. Ms. Jones attended a diverse, low-income school outside Baltimore, after she and her mother fled domestic violence. Students there were seen as \u201cthose kids,\u201d for whom higher education seemed out of reach. In her junior year, against the advice of her administrators, the high-achieving student chose to cut her class schedule in half to join a program, called \u201ccooperative education,\u201d that allowed her to do an apprenticeship at a hospital as a nursing assistant. The program was intended for students with behavioral and other challenges. That was not her profile, but it was the only program that kept Ms. Jones in high school. Her mother needed help paying the bills, and Ms. Jones was looking for a way to earn money. \u201cI learned more in that experience than in any of my schooling,\u201d said Ms. Jones, a trained molecular biologist. \u201cI realized that if you find opportunities for students, everybody has their place.\u201d Ms. Jones denies that she favors a certain type of school, but she admits she identifies with a certain kind of student. That includes students who, like her, were branded for taking a nontraditional path \u2014 although she was ranked No. 1 in her class, she could not be valedictorian because she enrolled in the alternative program. Students who put themselves through college on stipends and scholarships. And others who take career diversions like she did to attend a for-profit massage therapy school and run her own business, gaining skills to navigate their way to powerful institutions like the National Science Foundation, Congress, and the Education and Labor Departments. Ms. Jones said that it was those experiences that were driving her changes, and what she believed was an honest conversation about improving every part of the higher education system. \u201cThere are people out there who think this can be done in a different way, and I don\u2019t resent that,\u201d she said. \u201cBut frankly, I have ideas for how to do it, and mine are grounded in the experience of being the underdog.\u201d",

      "author": "Kate Zernike",
      "content": " It is hard to find anyone more passionate about the idea of steering public dollars away from traditional public schools than Betsy DeVos, Donald J. Trump\u2019s pick as the cabinet secretary overseeing the nation\u2019s education system. For nearly 30 years, as a philanthropist, activist and Republican fund-raiser, she has pushed to give families taxpayer money in the form of vouchers to attend private and parochial schools, pressed to expand publicly funded but privately run charter schools, and tried to strip teacher unions of their influence. A daughter of privilege, she also married into it; her husband, Dick, who ran unsuccessfully for governor of Michigan a decade ago, is heir to the Amway fortune. Like many education philanthropists, she argues that children\u2019s ZIP codes should not confine them to failing schools. But Ms. DeVos\u2019s efforts to expand educational opportunity in her home state of Michigan and across the country have focused little on existing public schools, and almost entirely on establishing newer, more entrepreneurial models to compete with traditional schools for students and money. Her donations and advocacy go almost entirely toward groups seeking to move students and money away from what Mr. Trump calls \u201cfailing government schools.\u201d Conservative school choice activists hailed her on Wednesday as a fellow disrupter, and as someone who would block what they see as federal intrusion on local schools. Former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, where Ms. DeVos helped push legislation establishing tax credits for scholarships to private schools, called her an \u201coutstanding pick,\u201d a \u201cpassionate change agent to press for a new education vision.\u201d \u201cHer allegiance is to families, particularly those struggling at the bottom of the economic ladder, not to an outdated public education model that has failed them from one generation to the next,\u201d he wrote on Facebook. Frederick M. Hess, the director of education policy studies for the conservative American Enterprise Institute in Washington, called Ms. DeVos a \u201csmart, principled small-government conservative who\u2019s experienced in politics and versed in the relevant policy.\u201d But to teachers\u2019 unions, she is anathema. Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, called Ms. DeVos \u201cthe most ideological, anti-public education nominee\u201d since the secretary of education was elevated to the cabinet level four decades ago. Even some groups that share her support for charter schools worried that picking someone so closely identified as a champion of vouchers signaled that the Trump administration would try to starve public schools. As a candidate, Mr. Trump proposed steering $20 billion in existing federal money toward vouchers that families could use to help pay for private or parochial schools, perhaps tapping into $15 billion in so-called Title I money that goes to schools that serve the country\u2019s poorest children. He called school choice \u201cthe civil rights issues of our time.\u201d Amber Arellano, the executive director of the Education Trust-Midwest, an advocacy group in Michigan that supports charters but has been critical of a Michigan charter school law that Ms. DeVos has spent millions to defend, said the pick had \u201cthe potential to undermine the nation\u2019s hard-won progress by diverting resources from the young people who most need them, or by failing to uphold the federal government\u2019s responsibility to protecting the needs and interests of all students \u2014 especially the most vulnerable.\u201d Michigan is one of the nation\u2019s biggest school choice laboratories, especially with charter schools. The Detroit, Flint and Grand Rapids school districts have among the nation\u2019s 10 largest shares of students in charters, and the state sends $1 billion in education funding to charters annually. Of those schools, 80 percent are run by for-profit organizations, a far higher share than anywhere else in the nation. The DeVoses, the most prominent name in state Republican politics, have been the biggest financial and political backers of the effort. But if Michigan is a center of school choice, it is also among the worst places to argue that choice has made schools better. As the state embraced and then expanded charters over the past two decades, its rank has fallen on national reading and math tests. Most charter schools perform below the state average. And a federal review in 2015 found \u201can unreasonably high\u201d percentage of charter schools on the list of the state\u2019s lowest-performing schools. The number of charter schools on that list had doubled since 2010, after the passage of a law a group financed by Ms. DeVos pushed to expand the schools. The group blocked a provision in that law that would have prevented failing schools from expanding or replicating. Ms. DeVos, 58, got into education advocacy primarily as a backer of vouchers, and has served on the board of several organizations that have campaigned for them across the country. A ballot initiative she led to establish vouchers in Michigan failed in 2000. The next year, she established the Great Lakes Education Project, which became an ardent proponent of charter school expansion, and has donated generously to candidates who have supported it. The Michigan law pushed by Ms. DeVos to establish charter schools 20 years ago allows an unusually large number of organizations to start such schools, yet established little mechanism for oversight. Even Republican supporters of charter schools say the law has allowed failing charter schools to expand or replicate. Last spring, the DeVos-backed group was the chief force behind the defeat of legislation that would have established standards for identifying and closing failing schools, both charter and public, in Detroit, where a flood of charter schools in the past decade has created what even charter school supporters call chaos. Ms. DeVos was born in Western Michigan, the more conservative and religious part of the state, where her father created a successful auto parts company. Her brother is Erik Prince, the founder of Blackwater, the troubled private security contractor that was awarded billions in United States government contracts in the Middle East. Like many conservatives who supported Mr. Trump, she does not support Common Core, the set of standards for what students should know at each grade level that was developed by the National Governors Association and other groups \u2014 and that has been incorrectly branded as a federal policy. She also had not supported Mr. Trump; her family was behind Senator Marco Rubio of Florida in the Republican presidential primary. On Wednesday, she wrote on Twitter: \u201cI am honored to work with the president-elect on his vision to make American education great again. The status quo in ed is not acceptable.\u201d",

FitzsimmonsPRINT EDITIONOutrage and Skepticism: Reactions to New Rules on Campus Sexual Assault|August 31, 2018, Page A14",
      "author": "Jennifer Medina",
      "content": "  LOS ANGELES \u2014 College students across the country are heading back to school as the debate intensifies over how to deal with accusations of sexual harassment and assault in and around campus. After repeatedly criticizing Obama-era regulations, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos is preparing an overhaul of federal policies dealing with sexual misconduct in colleges. The proposed changes will give more rights to students accused of rape, assault or harassment and lessen the liability of campus administrators, while encouraging officials to offer more support to victims. The new rules narrow the definition of sexual harassment and hold schools responsible only for formal complaints and for actions that take place on campus. The regulations also continue Ms. DeVos\u2019s year-old policy of using mediation to reach informal resolutions and allow victims and their accused perpetrators to request evidence and to cross-examine each other. At schools that have grappled recently with allegations of sexual misconduct \u2014 like the University of Southern California, Michigan State University, and Ohio State University \u2014 the reaction to the proposed new rules was almost instant. Many students said they feared the rules would make it impossible for victims to feel comfortable filing complaints and would instead leave them even more isolated and fearful. Here are some reactions from students, alumni and advocates: As a graduate student at the University of Southern California in the early 1990s, Dana Loewy said she did not know whom she could turn to about the gynecologist in the student health center, Dr. George Tyndall, who is accused of sexually abusing women over decades. She complained to a female physician in the center that Dr. Tyndall was making her very uncomfortable, but nothing seemed to come of it. Ms. Loewy, who later became an English professor, surmised that the woman feared for her own job. \u201cThis is going to let campuses off the hook just as we were starting to scratch the surface to hold them accountable,\u201d Ms. Loewy said. \u201cI think it is a setback for those of us who seek justice for women. It\u2019s hard enough for people who are victims of harassment or assault to come forward and I fear this will make it even more difficult.\u201d Ms. Loewy said she feared that her own lawsuit against U.S.C., which claims that university officials should have done more to protect students from Dr. Tyndall, would become tougher. \u201cI don\u2019t think it will have an impact retroactively, but it will make a more hostile climate,\u201d she said. Now a senior at U.S.C., Brennan Heil said she went to the student health center to get tested for sexually transmitted diseases after she was raped in her hometown, far from campus, in 2016. Dr. Tyndall aggressively questioned her about her sexual activity, she said, pressing for details about how often she had oral sex and whether it was with men or women. \u201cWhen will the students be put first and when will they say, \u2018Yes, you have been hurt, and yes, we were responsible for you?\u2019\u201d Ms. Heil said. \u201cTo say schools only need to account for issues on campus is absurd \u2014 most students live off campus. How far does my rapist have to drag me before I stop mattering to my school?\u201d Ms. Heil said that even after Dr. Tyndall examined her so roughly that she screamed, she was reluctant to report him through official university channels, convinced that nothing would come of it. \u201cEvery time I had tried that in the past, they would dismiss me,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd telling someone at the university would mean having to admit I was no longer a virgin, which meant a lot to my psyche at the time. I\u2019d come from a small town and trusted doctors. I didn\u2019t have any experience that left me trusting the university.\u201d Cynthia P. Garrett, a co-president of Families Advocating for Campus Equality, an advocacy group for students who are accused of misconduct, said the new rules seemed to take a fair approach. \u201cI think the department is trying to balance the interests of all parties,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re also trying to preserve basic rights for the accused, which includes the presumption of innocence. I don\u2019t understand why anyone would object to that.\u201d Ms. Garrett said she doubted that universities would actually allow someone who made an assault allegation to be cross-examined by the person they accused. \u201cThat\u2019s beyond even what we\u2019ve asked for,\u201d she said, adding that schools might, however, allow a lawyer or administrator to question the person, or to submit a list of written questions. Ms. Garrett said that some groups were overreacting to the new rules. \u201cI don\u2019t think it will make it harder for victims to report it,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want victims to have protections. We want them to feel free to report. But we don\u2019t want a decision based on less than it should be.\u201d Morgan McCaul, 18, a sophomore at the University of Michigan and a survivor of abuse by Dr. Lawrence G. Nassar, said she was \u201chorrified\u201d by the new rules, especially the idea of allowing a victim to be cross-examined by the person accused of attacking her. \u201cI think that it\u2019s an attack on students\u2019 rights disguised as due process,\u201d Ms. McCaul said as she prepared to return to school for the fall semester. She asked Ms. DeVos on Twitter on Wednesday: \u201cIs ruining lives your version of a back-to-school welcome?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s scary,\u201d Ms. McCaul said on Thursday. \u201cAs a current college student, I\u2019m really concerned.\u201d Dr. Nassar, a physician at Michigan State University, was accused of sexually abusing hundreds of young women, including prominent gymnasts. On Thursday, the N.C.A.A. dropped its investigation of the university\u2019s role in the scandal. Ms. McCaul said the timing of both announcements was a \u201cdouble-edged insult to survivors of sexual assault and abuse.\u201d Justin Johnson, an alumnus of Michigan State, recently ran for a spot on its board of trustees because he was unhappy with the university\u2019s response to the Nassar case. He said its top priority should be protecting survivors of abuse. \u201cIn a lot of cases, survivors were still forced to live with or see their rapist on a daily basis, in the cafeteria or in classrooms,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s really important that any school has a process in which first and foremost, the victim\u2019s concerns are addressed.\u201d Mr. Johnson, who graduated from Michigan State in 2001 and runs a manufacturing company, said schools like Michigan State and Ohio State need more pressure to support survivors, not less. \u201cThis is bad timing for Michigan State because it\u2019s going to make it easier for us to look the other way on problems that we face,\u201d he said. Mr. Johnson said he was concerned about schools being held legally responsible only for investigating formal complaints, and not, for instance, those to a residential adviser in a dormitory. \u201cI used to be an R.A.,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s odd that we\u2019re sold as a position of authority, but they would not consider an R.A. as a formal channel.\u201d",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Tensions over President Trump\u2019s nominations turned into a parliamentary game of chicken on Monday, with Republican leaders vowing to keep the Senate in session, day and night, until lawmakers confirm four of his cabinet picks. After days of grasping at procedural hurdles, Democrats held vigil against Betsy DeVos, Mr. Trump\u2019s polarizing nominee for education secretary, and promised to spend the final 24 hours before her confirmation vote Tuesday reiterating their objections. But as Democrats made clear they had no intention of yielding even a minute of their allotted floor time to debate Mr. Trump\u2019s nominations \u2014 a final act of parliamentary disobedience for a minority party that lacks the votes to block a nominee on its own \u2014 Republicans stood their ground. Daring Democrats to keep their word at the expense of several sleepless nights, Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the chamber\u2019s No. 2 Republican, said the Senate session would not end until lawmakers confirmed four of Mr. Trump\u2019s nominees: Ms. DeVos, Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama as attorney general, Representative Tom Price of Georgia to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, and Steven T. Mnuchin as Treasury secretary. The effort could last into Saturday and might involve burning \u201ca little midnight oil,\u201d Mr. Cornyn said. Short one critical but elusive Republican \u201cno\u201d vote against Ms. DeVos \u2014 a billionaire philanthropist with little experience in public schools and a remarkably shaky showing at her confirmation hearing \u2014 Democrats on Monday did the only thing they could: They talked. Senator Patty Murray of Washington announced that Democrats would occupy the floor until the vote on Ms. DeVos\u2019s nomination, which is expected around midday on Tuesday. Ms. Murray is the top Democrat on the committee that approved Ms. DeVos along a party-line vote, and one of her most strident opponents. Publicly, Democrats held out hope that they could woo one more Republican dissenter to join Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska in voting against Ms. DeVos. Both announced last week that they would not support Ms. DeVos\u2019s nomination. Their defections, combined with a unified vote from the Democratic caucus, set up a 50-50 tie on the nomination, which Vice President Mike Pence would have to break in his capacity as president of the Senate. Appearing later at a demonstration outside the Capitol, Ms. Murray urged protesters to pressure Republicans to oppose Ms. DeVos. \u201cIf we can persuade one more Republican to do the right thing, we can double down on the message we\u2019re all sending to President Trump: The Senate stands with public education!\u201d Ms. Murray said. A deluge of constituent calls and messages against Mr. Trump\u2019s nominees and executive orders has overwhelmed some Senate offices and even the Capitol phone system in recent days, echoing demonstrations across the country. Energized by the opposition, Democrats seemed ready on Monday to resort to sleeping bags if necessary. Senator Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland, said Ms. DeVos had embraced a philosophy that abandoned poorer families. She has been vehemently criticized by many education advocates for favoring voucher programs over repairing public schools. \u201cWhat do we say to them?\u201d Mr. Van Hollen asked.",

      "author": "Erica L. Green",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Education Secretary Betsy DeVos told a Senate committee on Tuesday that the federal commission on school safety set up this year after the Parkland, Fla., school massacre will not focus on the role guns play in school violence. The comments, provided in testimony before the Senate subcommittee that oversees education spending, perplexed senators who questioned how the commission, led by Ms. DeVos and convened by President Trump, could avoid the subject when it was a military-style assault rifle that left 17 students and staff dead at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. \u201cThat\u2019s not part of the commission\u2019s charge, per se,\u201d Ms. DeVos said in response to a question from Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, about whether the commission would look at the role of firearms in the gun violence that has plagued the nation\u2019s schools. \u201cSo we\u2019ll look at gun violence in schools, but not look at guns? An interesting concept,\u201d Mr. Leahy said in response. Ms. DeVos\u2019s comments came about 24 hours before the commission\u2019s first public forum, scheduled for Wednesday at the Education Department, where it will solicit feedback on solutions to improve school safety. And it comes after months of criticism \u2014 including from the students who survived the Marjory Stoneman Douglas attack that in their response to the school shootings, the nation\u2019s political leaders have zeroed in on everything but guns. Shortly after Parkland, Republicans pointed to Obama-era school discipline policies as a potential culprit. As the gun-control legislation flagged in Congress, leaders shifted their focus toward measures that would beef up security at the nation\u2019s schools, including the possibility of arming teachers. In recent weeks, the commission has held closed-door meetings with survivors of school attacks dating to the Columbine High School massacre in 1999, and last week Ms. DeVos visited a school in Maryland where she observed a popular discipline alternative strategy, called positive behavioral intervention and supports. \u201cOur focus is on raising up successful, proven techniques and approaches to ensuring schools are safe,\u201d Ms. DeVos said. When the White House announced the commission, it listed several areas the group would examine. The first was age restrictions on certain firearm purchases. The commission\u2019s members include Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex M. Azar II and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. It is charged with bringing \u201cmeaningful and actionable recommendations to keep students safe at school.\u201d Among other areas, the commission is slated to examine ratings systems for video games, the consumption of \u201cviolent entertainment\u201d and the effects of news media coverage of mass shootings. The group is also charged with considering whether to repeal a package of Obama-era school discipline policies targeted at addressing disciplinary policies that disproportionately affect minority students. The commission is also looking to fund and bolster mental health and school infrastructure resources. Liz Hill, a spokeswoman for the department, clarified after the hearing that \u201cthe secretary and the commission continue to look at all issues the president asked the committee to study and are focused on making recommendations that the agencies, states and local communities can implement.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s important to note that the commission cannot create or amend current gun laws \u2014 that is the Congress\u2019s job,\u201d Ms. Hill said. Bob Farrace, a spokesman for the National Association of Secondary School Principals, said, \u201cIf the commission won\u2019t address the role of guns in school violence, we hope that means it also won\u2019t recommend a proliferation of guns in schools \u2014 arming teachers, eliminating gun-free school zones and other ill-advised proposals that will make schools less safe.\u201d During the hearing, Ms. DeVos evaded questions that would draw her into the gun control debate. When Mr. Leahy asked whether she thought that an 18-year-old high school student should be able to walk into a store and purchase an AR-15 military-style weapon and hundreds of rounds of ammunition, Ms. DeVos pivoted. \u201cI know that this body and your counterparts have addressed a number of these issues, and I know that you\u2019re going to continue to debate them,\u201d she responded, adding that teenagers\u2019 access to guns was \u201cvery much a matter for debate.\u201d Mr. Leahy replied, \u201cWell, you\u2019re studying things like how much time they spend on video games and all that, but you can go to a lot of other countries where they spend just as much time but have only a tiny fraction of the shootings that we do.\u201d Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire, implored Ms. DeVos to look at the policies of other countries where school shootings are rare or nonexistent. Ms. Shaheen cited statistics showing that school shootings in the United States \u201coccur at a scale far beyond any other industrialized nation.\u201d Since 2009, she said, the United States has had 57 times as many school shootings as the rest of the Group of 7 large advanced economies combined \u2014 288 in American schools, compared with two in Canada and France, one in Germany and zero in Japan, Italy and Britain. \u201cIt does seem to me that you should think about reworking the mission of the commission,\u201d she said. Ms. DeVos said the commission would make its recommendations by the end of the year. Since the committee was announced in March, there has been at least one more mass shooting at a school. Last month, a 17-year-old student opened fire at his high school in Santa Fe, Tex., killing 10 people.",

      "author": "Stephanie Saul",
      "content": "  ARLINGTON, Va. \u2014 Saying that the Obama administration\u2019s approach to policing campus sexual assault had \u201cfailed too many students,\u201d Education Secretary Betsy DeVos said on Thursday that her administration would rewrite the rules in an effort to protect both the victims of sexual assault and the accused. Ms. DeVos did not say what changes she had in mind. But in a strongly worded speech, she made clear she believed that in an effort to protect victims, the previous administration had gone too far and forced colleges to adopt procedures that sometimes deprived accused students of their rights. \u201cThrough intimidation and coercion, the failed system has clearly pushed schools to overreach,\u201d she said in an address at George Mason University in suburban Arlington, Va. \u201cWith the heavy hand of Washington tipping the balance of her scale, the sad reality is that Lady Justice is not blind on campuses today.\u201d Advocates for assault victims reacted strongly and swiftly, as did Arne Duncan, who was education secretary during most of the Obama administration. \u201cThis administration wants to take us back to the days when colleges swept sexual assault under the rug,\u201d Mr. Duncan said in a statement. \u201cInstead of building on important work to pursue justice, they are once again choosing politics over students, and students will pay the price.\u201d But Ms. DeVos\u2019s remarks, delivered to a student chapter of the Federalist Society, an organization of conservative and libertarian lawyers, echoed complaints by conservatives and lawyers for accused students that colleges were punishing students unfairly. Frederick M. Hess, director of education policy for the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, noted that courts have reversed some punishments handed down by campus administrators. \u201cI think DeVos laid out a sensible, responsible approach to crafting a more measured policy that can better secure the rights of all involved,\u201d he said. In recent years, campuses across the country have been roiled by high-profile sexual assault cases. A scandal involving the Baylor University football team ultimately led to the removal of the school\u2019s president, Kenneth W. Starr, the former independent counsel whose work led to President Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment. A 2015 survey of students at 27 schools, commissioned by the Association of American Universities, found that nearly one in four women had complained of sexual assault or sexual misconduct. Advocates for victims seized on the study, but as with similar reports, it was criticized by some for overstating the problem, and even its authors acknowledged that it had limitations. Though Ms. DeVos said she believed that accused students were often mistreated, she also said that victims were being ill-served by a quasi-judicial process that lacked the sophistication required for such sensitive matters. Ms. DeVos repeatedly used the term \u201csurvivors,\u201d a term often preferred by victims when speaking of sexual assault. And she also vowed that colleges would not return to the days when sexual assault complaints were ignored. \u201cOne rape is one too many,\u201d she said. \u201cOne assault is one too many. One aggressive act of harassment is one too many.\u201d But her remarks focused more heavily on the young men who, she said, were denied due process in campus proceedings, sometimes attempting suicide. She referred to campus sexual misconduct hearings as \u201ckangaroo courts\u201d that forced administrators to act as \u201cjudge and jury.\u201d Referring to scores of lawsuits filed by punished students, she said: \u201cSurvivors aren\u2019t well served when they are re-traumatized with appeal after appeal because the failed system failed the accused. And no student should be forced to sue their way to due process.\u201d She suggested that colleges had gone too far in other types of cases, too. In the speech, Ms. DeVos referred to a case at the University of Southern California in which the football team\u2019s kicker, Matt Boermeester, was suspended from school and kicked off the squad after being investigated for physically assaulting his girlfriend. The girlfriend later spoke out in defense of Mr. Boermeester, saying no assault had happened. In a statement Thursday, the university said it stood by its investigation, and that evidence from multiple witnesses suggested \u201can act of violence took place that violated our university codes of conduct and Title IX regulations.\u201d Ms. DeVos signaled in July that she was thinking of rewriting the rules, by holding listening sessions with victims, students who had been accused and higher-education officials. Though she announced no specific changes on Thursday, Ms. DeVos did say she would open a public comment period, an administrative step taken before a government agency issues new guidelines. Any move would be aimed at revising or rescinding a 2011 guidance letter from the Education Department to college officials across the country. The letter required a tougher response to campus sexual-assault accusations under Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972, which prohibits sex discrimination in education, and it warned the colleges that federal funding would be at risk if they did not comply. The letter set out a number of requirements, including having employees trained to handle sexual assault complaints and mandating that the accuser and the accused have equal access to advisers or legal counsel. Most controversially, it asked schools to adopt a \u201cpreponderance of evidence\u201d standard in evaluating accusations, a lower bar than many schools had previously used. In essence, schools would hold accused students responsible if more than 50 percent of the evidence pointed to their guilt. Previously, many universities had required \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidence to substantiate an accusation, meaning that the claim is highly probable. Many cases involve alcohol-clouded sexual encounters where only two people were present, contributing to the difficulty of evaluating accusations, which often come down to determining whether a woman was sober enough to give consent. Critics of the Obama administration\u2019s guidance to colleges complained that it was unfair to use a standard of proof that was far lower than that used in criminal law, since disciplinary actions and expulsions that result from ambiguous sexual encounters can stigmatize young men long into the future, affecting their educational and job prospects. The critics argued that if sexual assault had, in fact, taken place, it should be a matter for the police. Ms. DeVos appeared to side with this point of view, saying Thursday that \u201cWashington dictated that schools must use the lowest standard of proof.\u201d But victims\u2019 groups say that criminal law is the wrong model for colleges, which do not have the investigative and subpoena powers of law enforcement, and that the more aggressive guidance issued by the Obama administration helped make colleges safer for women, correcting a previous imbalance in which accusers were often not taken seriously. In a statement, the National Women\u2019s Law Center said Ms. DeVos\u2019s plan to issue new rules to colleges was \u201ca blunt attack on survivors of sexual assault.\u201d \u201cIt will discourage schools from taking steps to comply with the law \u2014 just at the moment when they are finally working to get it right,\u201d the group said. \u201cAnd it sends a frightening message to all students: Your government does not have your back if your rights are violated.\u201d Although her speech was short on details of what the administration\u2019s new rules might look like, Ms. DeVos mentioned a proposal by the American Bar Association that entails independent three-person panels to adjudicate complaints, and a requirement that campuses provide advisers to both sides; and another proposal by the American College of Trial Lawyers that would shift to the \u201cclear and convincing\u201d standard of proof. She also mentioned an idea circulated by two lawyers who represent colleges in sexual assault cases that would establish a system of regional centers, possibly nonprofit organizations or arms of the government, to investigate and adjudicate campus sexual misconduct claims. The prospect of a change in the rules may require colleges to overhaul procedures that are just a few years old. Michael Roth, president of Wesleyan University, said Ms. DeVos\u2019s portrayal of the Obama-era guidelines as burdensome to colleges did not reflect his own views or those of other college presidents to whom he has spoken about the issue. \u201cI remember the times when men, with impunity, would throw their weight around,\u201d sexually harassing and assaulting women, Mr. Roth said. \u201cChanging that culture over the last decade, as the Obama administration tried to do, was an enormous contribution.\u201d Mr. Roth acknowledged that disciplinary procedures are imperfect, but he said that men accused of assault at Wesleyan are offered the presumption of innocence, are given access to a counselor, and are shown all relevant evidence pertaining to their case. But Justin Dillon, a lawyer in Washington who has represented dozens of accused college students, said he believed Ms. DeVos\u2019s speech \u201cis being secretly cheered by every university general counsel in the country.\u201d One of his cases involves a University of Virginia law school student whose degree was delayed for a year because of a sexual assault complaint. His lawsuit states that the adjudicator, a retired judge, called it a \u201cvery close\u201d case but that she had to rule against him because of the \u201cpreponderance of evidence\u201d standard. \u201cFundamentally,\u201d Mr. Dillon said Thursday, \u201cmy clients got into this because they felt strongly they wanted to be part of the fight against what they saw as unlawful conduct.\u201d",

      "author": "Erica L. Green",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Betsy DeVos, in her first extended policy address as education secretary, argued on Wednesday for an expansion of school choice programs, pointing to lagging test scores and a program championed by the Obama administration that funneled billions into low-performing schools but failed to produce better academic outcomes. Speaking at the Brookings Institution, which released a ranking of choice options in the country\u2019s 100 largest school districts, Ms. DeVos made her case for choice policies that she said focused on the \u201cindividual child.\u201d And she called for the rejection of an \u201cus versus them mentality\u201d when it comes to investing in programs, like charter schools and school vouchers, to which President Trump has proposed giving part of a $1.4 billion funding increase in the fiscal year that begins in October. \u201cOur nation\u2019s commitment is to provide a quality education to every child to serve the greater public, common good,\u201d Ms. DeVos said in her address. \u201cAccordingly, we must shift the paradigm to think about education funding as investments made in individual children, not in institutions or buildings.\u201d While Ms. DeVos offered no new details about the Education Department\u2019s budget \u2014 which in the president\u2019s budget blueprint takes a $9 billion, or 13.5 percent, cut \u2014 she rejected the notion that money was a panacea for the challenges facing public schools. She resurrected a report released by the Education Department in the final days of President Barack Obama\u2019s administration, which showed that a program that funneled $7 billion into the nation\u2019s worst-performing schools had little to no effect on academic results. The report, which was issued in January and examined the impact of School Improvement Grants, found \u201cno significant impacts\u201d on \u201cmath or reading test scores, high school graduation or college enrollment of students.\u201d The grants were started under the George W. Bush administration, but received increased funding under the Obama administration in 2009. \u201cAt what point do we accept the fact that throwing money at the problem isn\u2019t the solution?\u201d Ms. DeVos asked. The Trump administration\u2019s budget proposal includes $168 million in spending on charter schools and $250 million for providing families with vouchers to use at private schools. A $1 billion increase in Title 1 funding, which supports schools that serve high concentrations of low-income students, would be granted to districts that adopt policies considered trademarks of choice districts, like student-based budgeting and open enrollment. Ms. DeVos offered no more details about how the new program would be structured, the size of individual vouchers or the families that would be eligible. The administration\u2019s plans have been derided by critics as potentially devastating for traditional public schools, which would lose students and money. The choice plan has especially drawn the ire of congressional Democrats, as well as Republicans who represent rural areas where alternatives to local schools are limited and where voters favor improvements to local public schools. Ms. DeVos likened the opposition to the school choice movement to that of taxi companies that opposed ride-sharing companies like Uber and Lyft. \u201cJust as the traditional taxi system revolted against ride sharing, so too does the education establishment feel threatened by the rise of school choice,\u201d Ms. DeVos said. \u201cIn both cases, the entrenched status quo has resisted models that empower individuals.\u201d Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers and a consistent critic of Ms. DeVos\u2019s school choice ideology, took to Twitter to rebuke Ms. Devos\u2019s ride-sharing analogy. \u201cIs she equating kids to cab riders & teachers are drivers?\u201d Ms. Weingarten asked in her post. \u201cCab drivers are hard-working pros, but teachers have advanced degrees to teach.\u201d Ms. Weingarten also pointed out that Uber \u201cis in turmoil.\u201d Ms. DeVos spoke at an event where Brookings highlighted districts that have strong infrastructures for choice. The research organization released its fifth annual Education Choice and Competition Index, which assigns a letter grade to 100 of the nation\u2019s largest school districts based on the availability of school options, such as charters and private schools, or other vehicles, like voucher programs and open enrollment policies, for giving families access to schools beyond their neighborhoods. Districts were also assessed on measures like how easily families could gain access to information about school options and performance. Denver topped the list for its mixture of schools and its accessible application process, followed by the Recovery School District in New Orleans, an all-charter district. New York City ranked third. Russ Whitehurst, a senior Brookings fellow, said that while school choice was thriving, a vast majority of students \u2014 81 percent in the nation\u2019s largest districts \u2014 are in traditional public schools. Mr. Whitehurst said the report was not intended to endorse school choice. \u201cChoice is merely the precondition for new systems of delivering education,\u201d Mr. Whitehurst said, \u201cnot a guarantee of success of those systems relative to the traditional school district model.\u201d When pressed by Mr. Whitehurst on whether choice policies could potentially produce even worse academic outcomes, Ms. DeVos pointed to test scores on the PISA (Program for International Student Assessment) and NAEP (National Assessment of Educational Progress), which she said have shown little progress. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how they could get a lot worse on a nationwide basis than they are today,\u201d she said.",

PetersPRINT EDITIONFriends Cite Education Pick\u2019s Firm, but Quiet, Support for Gay Rights|January 29, 2017, Page A15",
      "author": "Jeremy W. Peters",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 When Greg McNeilly, a longtime Republican operative in Michigan, and his husband filed paperwork in 2015 to adopt a child, it included a warm testament of support from a seemingly unlikely source: Betsy DeVos, the conservative school choice advocate whose family has donated heavily to groups that oppose gay rights. As a couple, she wrote, the two shared \u201ca close, caring relationship where they treat each other with respect.\u201d Ms. DeVos, who is now President Trump\u2019s nominee for education secretary, was also the first person to text her congratulations to Mr. McNeilly after his 2014 marriage in a small and hurried courthouse ceremony. If she had been able to attend, it would not have been her first. In 2013, some two years before the Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage nationwide, she was in the audience at the the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, in Washington, when the center\u2019s president, Michael Kaiser, wed his husband in a ceremony officiated by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Ms. DeVos\u2019s support for her gay friends and for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights are a largely unknown but deep-seated aspect of her history, dating as far back as the late 1990s. At that time, two colleagues recalled, she made accommodations for a transgender woman to use the women\u2019s restroom at a Michigan Republican Party call center. She also used her political connections to help persuade other Michigan Republicans to sign a brief urging the Supreme Court to legalize same-sex marriage in 2015, though she did not sign it herself. This aspect of Ms. DeVos\u2019s personal story is not only at odds with the public image of her and her family as prominent financiers of conservative causes, but it also stands out in a nascent administration with a number of members who have a history of opposing gay rights. A Senate confirmation vote on her nomination is scheduled for this week. The incomplete picture of Ms. DeVos, 59, exists in part because she has never publicly sought to correct it. Doing so, friends and associates said in interviews, would have put her in the awkward position of clashing with the elder members of her and her husband\u2019s families, something she was loath to do. But over the past month, associates have come forward to share stories that they say they hope offer a fuller and more nuanced portrait of her character and beliefs. \u201cShe would say it\u2019s a part of her faith,\u201d said Mr. McNeilly, who has worked for Ms. DeVos in various capacities for two decades. \u201cHer faith teaches her to be tolerant. And like most of America, she\u2019s evolved.\u201d While Ms. DeVos\u2019s acceptance of gay rights may be welcome news to Republicans who think their party needs to move past the issue, it is likely to be worrisome to social conservatives who hope that the Trump administration will roll back some of the liberal social policies that went into effect under President Barack Obama. Chief among these is an Obama administration directive \u2014 issued by the Education and Justice Departments \u2014 instructing schools to allow transgender students to use the bathrooms that match their gender identity. \u201cI\u2019m concerned about any centralized idea of what should be the norms for students across America,\u201d said Frank Cannon, president of the American Principles Project, a conservative policy group. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think that any worldview, whether it\u2019s the most conservative or liberal, ought to dictate a centralized form of education.\u201d \u201cObviously, when you\u2019re talking about bureaucracy,\u201d Mr. Cannon added, \u201cthe worldview is much more likely to be a liberal one.\u201d Ms. DeVos declined to comment for this article. Mr. Trump has left open how he will approach the school bathroom issue. He has, however, taken a more liberal attitude toward transgender rights than most other Republicans, saying, for instance, that Caitlyn Jenner could use any bathroom in his hotels that she wanted to. Ms. DeVos\u2019s personal experience with the debate over gender identity and bathrooms dates back decades. As chairwoman of the Michigan Republican Party, she came to the aid of a transgender woman who wanted to use the women\u2019s restroom at a call center, upsetting some of the other women there, according to two associates at the time \u2014 Mr. McNeilly, who was the party\u2019s political director, and Eric Doster, the general counsel. \u201cWe made the accommodation, and that was Betsy\u2019s call,\u201d said Mr. Doster, who did not recall the woman\u2019s name but said this happened in an office near the Michigan State University campus in 1997 or 1998. \u201cA lot of the co-workers weren\u2019t happy with it. But that\u2019s who Betsy is.\u201d But, like other supportive moves she has made over the years, it was done quietly. When Ken Mehlman, a former Republican National Committee chairman, was collecting signatures from Republicans for a 2015 legal brief that argued in favor of a constitutional right for same-sex marriage, he turned to Ms. DeVos for help in recruiting people in Michigan. She agreed, friends said. Peter F. Secchia, a friend of Ms. DeVos\u2019s, former ambassador to Italy and one of the Republicans who signed the brief, recalled that the episode was not without some minor discomfort, given the elder DeVoses\u2019 support for groups opposed to gay rights. Mr. Secchia said that after he signed the brief, he called Ms. DeVos\u2019s father-in-law, Richard DeVos, the billionaire co-founder of Amway, as a courtesy. \u201cI think he was very understanding and very happy that I\u2019d called him,\u201d Mr. Secchia said, noting how Ms. DeVos\u2019s involvement with the brief also put her at odds with her mother, Elsa Prince Broekhuizen, whose foundation has also been active in socially conservative issues. \u201cBut this is a tough situation,\u201d he added, for a woman \u201cwho has two families that lean the other way.\u201d Ms. DeVos\u2019s opponents have often conflated her family\u2019s financial support for anti-gay rights initiatives with her own political activities. Ms. DeVos\u2019s in-laws and mother gave heavily to a successful 2004 effort in Michigan to enshrine a ban on same-sex marriage in the state\u2019s Constitution. But records from the secretary of state show no donations from Ms. DeVos or her husband, Richard DeVos Jr. At the time, she was chairwoman of the state party, and her colleagues said she was lukewarm to the idea at best. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like, when we would meet, it was her top priority,\u201d said Mike Cox, a former Michigan attorney general, who supported the measure but has since changed his mind about same-sex marriage. Mr. McNeilly, who was the party\u2019s executive director in 2004, was publicly critical of the ballot proposal then \u2014 acting, he said, with Ms. DeVos\u2019s blessing. \u201cConstitutional amendments are not good places to make bumper sticker statements,\u201d he was quoted as saying in The Detroit News in 2003. Ms. DeVos\u2019s record has not always spoken for itself, however, and she has sometimes struggled to separate her activities and beliefs from her family\u2019s. Under questioning at her confirmation hearing this month, she was at a loss to tell senators why her name was listed as vice president of her mother\u2019s foundation, the Edgar and Elsa Prince Foundation, a generous contributor to groups like Focus on the Family and the Family Research Council, both of which ardently oppose gay rights. Ms. DeVos blamed \u201ca clerical error\u201d but did not elaborate. It turned out that the tax forms on which she was listed were prepared by a former associate of her mother\u2019s who embezzled millions of dollars from Ms. Prince.",

      "author": "Stephanie Saul",
      "content": "  Education Secretary Betsy DeVos on Friday scrapped a key part of government policy on campus sexual assault, saying she was giving colleges more freedom to balance the rights of accused students with the need to crack down on serious misconduct. The move, which involved rescinding two sets of guidelines several years old, was part of one of the fiercest battles in higher education today, over whether the Obama administration, in trying to get colleges to take sexual assault more seriously, had gone too far and created a system that treated the accused unfairly. The most controversial portion of the Obama-era guidelines had demanded colleges use the lowest standard of proof, \u201cpreponderance of the evidence,\u201d in deciding whether a student is responsible for sexual assault, a verdict that can lead to discipline and even expulsion. On Friday, the Education Department said colleges were free to abandon that standard and raise it to a higher standard known as \u201cclear and convincing evidence.\u201d In announcing the change, the latest in a widespread rollback of Obama-era rules by the Trump administration, the department issued a statement saying that the old rules \u201clacked basic elements of fairness.\u201d The move had been long sought by advocates for accused students, most of whom are men, who had complained that campus judicial processes had become heavily biased in favor of female accusers. \u201cThe campus justice system was and is broken,\u201d said Robert Shibley, the executive director of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education. \u201cWith the end of this destructive policy, we finally have the opportunity to get it right.\u201d Ms. DeVos plans to enact new rules after a public comment period that department officials said could take at least several months, and in the meantime, colleges may choose to maintain the lower standard of proof. She did not provide any hints about whether the final rules would force schools to adopt the higher standard. Some states followed the lead of the Obama administration and passed laws requiring colleges to use the lower standard. But the move on Friday suggests Ms. DeVos wants colleges to consider making the change if they are legally able, raising the possibility that different colleges will begin to evaluate sexual assault complaints in different ways. Janet Napolitano, the president of the University of California system and a Homeland Security secretary in the Obama administration, said in a statement that the department\u2019s announcement would \u201cin effect weaken sexual violence protections, prompt confusion among campuses about how best to respond to reports of sexual violence and sexual harassment, and unravel the progress that so many schools have made.\u201d (California is one of the states now requiring the lower standard.) And Fatima Goss Graves, president of the National Women\u2019s Law Center, an advocacy group for women\u2019s rights, said Ms. DeVos\u2019s announcement would have a \u201cdevastating\u201d impact on students and schools. \u201cIt will discourage students from reporting assaults, create uncertainty for schools on how to follow the law and make campuses less safe,\u201d she said in a statement. Since many cases come down to one student\u2019s word against another\u2019s, and do not rise to the level of a police investigation, the evidentiary standard has become the main battleground in the nationwide fight over sexual behavior on campus. The \u201cpreponderance\u201d rule means colleges must find a student responsible if it is more likely than not that the student conducted a sexual act without the partner\u2019s consent. A \u201cclear and convincing\u201d case means it is highly probable the misconduct occurred. Even some liberal legal figures took issue with the Obama administration\u2019s approach, arguing that no student should be punished unless the school was more certain that a line had been crossed. Dozens of disciplined students have sued their colleges, some of them successfully, claiming that their rights had been violated. \u201cThe vast majority of campus sexual assault cases involve a lot of alcohol and no witnesses, so you essentially have two people who were probably drinking trying to recall events that may have happened weeks, months, or even years before,\u201d said Justin Dillon, a lawyer in Washington who has represented dozens of college men accused of sexual misconduct. One of his clients sued the Education Department last year, saying he had been found responsible for sexual assault only because the University of Virginia, where he was a law student at the time, had switched to the lower standard. According to his lawsuit, the accuser said that she had been unable to consent to sex because of alcohol consumption, while he claimed the accuser did not even appear to be intoxicated, let alone incapacitated. There are likely to be other immediate effects of Ms. DeVos\u2019s moves. She eliminated a requirement that investigations be completed in 60 days, now suggesting that the time frame be \u201creasonably prompt.\u201d The department will also allow mediation \u2014 sessions in which an accuser and accused hash out their differences \u2014 if both sides agree. Mediation was not permitted under the Obama administration guidelines, on the belief that women would feel pressure to participate. Christina Hoff Sommers, a scholar with the conservative American Enterprise Institute who has written about sexual assault, applauded the administration\u2019s decision to permit mediations, saying that some victims were not necessarily seeking a full-blown investigation and a trial. \u201cI think it\u2019s misguided to depict the average undergraduate in terms of oppressor and oppressed,\u201d she said. But Cari Simon, a Washington lawyer who represents sexual assault victims, said that colleges could use mediation to avoid addressing serious accusations. \u201cMediation allows schools to sweep sexual violence under the rug, treating it as a misunderstanding between students,\u201d she said. The Obama administration investigated hundreds of colleges based on student complaints that they had failed to adequately enforce sexual assault regulations. The Education Department had forced a number of colleges to change their procedures by threatening loss of federal funding. Department officials, in a conference call with reporters on Friday, indicated that they might discontinue some of the 350 or so active investigations if those cases hinged on rules that have now been rescinded. Those rules \u2014 delivered in a 2011 \u201cDear Colleague\u201d letter sent to colleges by the Obama Administration that laid out how sexual assault complaints were to be handled, as well a 2014 follow-up \u2014 came in response to accounts of colleges failing to take complaints seriously, letting untrained employees botch investigations and meting out little discipline. Since then, colleges have spent millions of dollars to hire and train investigators and counselors and to establish sexual assault prevention training for students. Those are likely to remain in place, and in a statement, Ms. DeVos said she expected colleges to not let their guard down. \u201cSchools must continue to confront these horrific crimes and behaviors head-on,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the process must also be fair and impartial, giving everyone more confidence in its outcomes.\u201d Ms. DeVos had signaled her desire to revisit the rules by holding private meetings in July with students who said they had been unfairly punished, as well as others who said their accusations had been mishandled. This month, in a speech at George Mason University\u2019s law school, she sharply criticized the Obama administration\u2019s approach. \u201cThrough intimidation and coercion, the failed system has clearly pushed schools to overreach,\u201d she said. Natalie Weill, a recent graduate of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, was among those on Friday expressing dismay about Ms. DeVos\u2019s move. She said that she had used the 2011 guidelines to convince the college that the student who attacked her should be expelled. Without them, \u201cI would have been forced to drop out of school or risk the danger of encountering the offender,\u201d she said. \u201cDeVos\u2019s decision is a disaster for students, and there will be an outcry from engaged and enraged students on this attack on our civil rights.\u201d In a statement, a spokeswoman for the university, Meredith McGlone, said a Wisconsin student who commits sexual assault today would be no less likely to be expelled because of the changes. \u201cOur policies and procedures are not changing,\u201d she said. But Patricia Hamill, a lawyer in Philadelphia, said that she was pleased with several aspects of the new guidance. She cited in particular the department\u2019s statements that it is a school\u2019s responsibility, not a student\u2019s, to gather evidence, and that the accused student must be informed in writing of the allegations before being asked to respond. Ms. Hamill said schools often did not give the accused much detail about the charges they were facing. On Friday, the department cited a decision last year in a lawsuit Ms. Hamill brought against Brandeis University. Her client, a student, had been found responsible for sexual misconduct against his ex-boyfriend during their 21-month relationship. In a decision allowing the case to proceed, Judge F. Dennis Saylor of the United States District Court in Boston noted that the school had used the \u201cpreponderance\u201d standard for sex cases but \u201cclear and convincing\u201d for almost all other types of alleged misconduct. Judge Saylor wrote that the \u201clower standard may thus be seen, in context, as part of an effort to tilt the playing field against accused students.\u201d",

Senators Break Ranks to Oppose Education Nominee|February 2, 2017, Page A1",
      "author": "Yamiche Alcindor",
      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 Two Republican senators on Wednesday said they would vote against President Trump\u2019s nominee for education secretary, delivering a blow to the White House and raising the possibility that Vice President Mike Pence would have to break a tie to win her confirmation. The nominee, Betsy DeVos, a billionaire with a complex web of financial investments, had already faced fierce opposition from Democrats and labor unions because of her political contributions to Republicans and her involvement in pushing alternatives to public education. But her confirmation hearing in front of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, during which she flubbed answers on education policy, also brought concerns from Republicans. Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, said Ms. DeVos had failed to demonstrate that she understood what public schools needed to succeed. \u201cI have serious concerns about a nominee to be secretary of education who has been so involved in one side of the equation, so immersed in the push for vouchers, that she may be unaware of what actually is successful within the public schools, and also what is broken and how to fix them,\u201d Ms. Murkowski said. Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said she respected Ms. DeVos\u2019s clear devotion to students and \u201cvaluable work\u201d in education. But she said she remained troubled by Ms. DeVos\u2019s focus on alternatives to public education, as well as what Ms. Collins called a \u201clack of familiarity\u201d with federal laws protecting children with special needs and disabilities. \u201cHer concentration on charter schools and vouchers, however, raises the question about whether or not she fully appreciates that the secretary of education\u2019s primary focus must be on helping states and communities, parents, teachers, school board administrators, school board members and administrators strengthen our public schools,\u201d Ms. Collins said. \u201cI will not, I cannot, vote to confirm her as our nation\u2019s next secretary of education.\u201d Senators and education advocates from both sides of the aisle were taken aback by Ms. DeVos\u2019s comments at her Jan. 17 confirmation hearing about core responsibilities of the Department of Education.  One exchange with Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, was later promoted heavily on social media by the Democratic Party and activist groups, including national education unions. In it, Mr. Kaine asked Ms. DeVos whether all schools that receive public money should have to follow the requirements of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, known as IDEA. Ms. DeVos responded, \u201cI think that\u2019s a matter that\u2019s best left to the states.\u201d In fact, under IDEA, a landmark 1975 civil rights law, states and school districts are required to provide special education services to children with disabilities. During the hearing, Ms. Collins said she had \u201cheard repeatedly\u201d from school officials that the most important action the federal government could take on education would be \u201cto fulfill the promise\u201d of IDEA by providing more funding for those students. Ms. DeVos responded to Ms. Collins that she would look at funding levels, but said, \u201cMaybe the money should follow individual students instead of going directly to the states.\u201d The pushback against Ms. DeVos played out in thousands of emails and phone calls urging senators to vote against her. Protesters showed up at her confirmation hearing, outside senators\u2019 offices and in Michigan, where Ms. DeVos has been involved in pushing education policies. Her nomination now hangs precariously on whether Republicans will rally the support of a few undeclared colleagues, or woo Democratic dissenters. Her chances got a boost on Wednesday with the support of two Republicans who were originally believed to oppose her, Senators Dean Heller of Nevada and Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania. If the Senate\u2019s Democrats and independents vote together, just one more Republican defection would be fatal to Ms. DeVos\u2019s prospects. If all other senators vote along party lines, Mr. Pence could break a 50-50 tie in his capacity as president of the Senate. But three Republican votes opposing her confirmation would result in an outright rejection of her nomination. Ms. DeVos\u2019s opponents said on Wednesday that they would target specific Republicans, including Mr. Heller and Senator Rob Portman of Ohio. If enough senators oppose Ms. DeVos, it would be just the second time in history that the Senate rejected a nominee for a first-term president assembling his cabinet, according to the Senate Historical Office. After Ms. Collins\u2019s and Ms. Murkowski\u2019s announcements, the Senate opened consideration of Ms. DeVos\u2019s nomination Wednesday, scheduling the first procedural hurdle to her confirmation for Friday. But amid strong Democratic opposition, it looks unlikely that the Senate\u2019s final vote will come until early next week. The president of the National Education Association, Lily Eskelsen Garc\u00eda, said educators, parents and students were \u201cgrateful\u201d for the opposition by Ms. Collins and Ms. Murkowski. \u201cThe nation is speaking out; senators need to listen,\u201d Ms. Eskelsen Garc\u00eda said. Dan Cantor, national director of the Working Families Party, which has been organizing protests outside senators\u2019 offices, said his group would be holding regular protests at Mr. Heller\u2019s office. Opponents of Ms. DeVos said they would target other Republicans, including Mr. Portman. \u201cThe DeVos family has given millions to elect Republicans, but that shouldn\u2019t buy her a cabinet post,\u201d Mr. Cantor said. \u201cThe first step was unity from the Senate Democrats. Now we\u2019re going to keep up that pressure on Senate Republicans.\u201d Democrats, teachers unions and liberal protesters have voiced concern about the DeVos family\u2019s contributions to groups that support so-called conversion therapy for gay people; Ms. DeVos\u2019s more than $200 million in donations to Republicans and their causes; and her past statements that government \u201csucks\u201d and that public schools are a \u201cdead end.\u201d Opponents have also focused on the poor performance of charter schools in Detroit, which Ms. DeVos has bankrolled even as she resisted legislation that would have blocked chronically failing charter schools from expanding. The White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, swiftly brushed off the defections as inconsequential, saying he had \u201czero\u201d concern about Ms. DeVos\u2019s confirmation by the Senate. Ms. DeVos\u2019s opponents were undeterred. \u201cThe more people get to know how ill equipped Betsy DeVos is to strengthen public schools, how disconnected she is from public schools, and how her record has been focused on pursuing for-profit charters and vouchers, and not children, the more the people who believe in the importance of public education are joining to oppose her,\u201d said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers. Meanwhile, in a display of fierce resistance against Mr. Trump that played out in a proxy battle against his nominees, Senate Democrats again boycotted committee votes on the nominations of Representative Tom Price and Steven T. Mnuchin, the president\u2019s picks to lead the Department of Health and Human Services and the Treasury, respectively. Democrats argued that new information had emerged to suggest that the two nominees had not been truthful in their confirmation testimony. Determined not to be thwarted, the committee\u2019s Republicans broke with the longstanding practice that at least one member of the minority party be present and held the votes anyway, unanimously agreeing to send the nominations to the Senate floor. At the same time, a divided Senate Judiciary Committee greenlighted Senator Jeff Sessions\u2019s nomination as attorney general along a straight party-line vote, sending it to the full Senate for a final vote. Democrats also boycotted a planned committee vote Wednesday on Scott Pruitt, Mr. Trump\u2019s choice to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, and continued to slow down consideration of Representative Mick Mulvaney, his pick for White House budget director.",

GreenPRINT EDITIONEducation Secretary Hires Advisers That Confound Critics\u2019 Expectations|June 3, 2017, Page A12",
      "author": "Erica L. Green",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Since her confirmation as the education secretary, Betsy DeVos has been the Trump cabinet member liberals love to hate, denouncing her as an out-of-touch, evangelical billionaire without the desire or capacity to protect vulnerable poor, black, immigrant, gay or transgender students. But while Ms. DeVos has been reluctant to express sympathy for those groups, she has stacked her administration with appointees whose personal and professional backgrounds challenge the narrative that she has no interest in protecting those vulnerable students. Among her appointees: a progressive Democrat who believes a broken education system is a form of white supremacy; a sexual assault survivor who is currently in a same-sex marriage; and a second-generation American who ran a federal program that helped undocumented immigrants. While the education secretary has done little to highlight the diversity in her administration \u2014 the department declined to make any of the appointees available for interviews \u2014 DeVos watchers say that diversity should encourage critics to focus more on her actions than their preconceptions. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely surprising, and should make people question their assumptions about this administration,\u201d Michael J. Petrilli, the president of the conservative-leaning Thomas B. Fordham Institute, an education policy think tank. Ms. DeVos\u2019s appointment of Candice E. Jackson to the department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights has been among the most hotly disputed. Ms. Jackson is perhaps best known for her high-profile involvement in attacks against Hillary Clinton during the presidential campaign, in which she elevated women who had accused former President Bill Clinton of sexual assault or harassment, while denouncing women who accused Mr. Trump of the same. Ms. Jackson will oversee some of the issues the Trump administration has signaled it would step back from \u2014 such as the treatment of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender students, and investigations of sexual assaults on campus. What is less known about Ms. Jackson is that she is a sexual assault survivor, and has been married to her wife for more than a decade. \u201cThe idea that this administration is going to be anti-L.G.B.T., anti-women \u2014 I think we need to watch and see what happens,\u201d Mr. Petrilli said. \u201cThis appointment should give folks on the left some comfort.\u201d Civil rights advocates, however, are skeptical. Ms. Jackson \u2014 who was appointed as a deputy in the civil rights office, but is leading it in an acting capacity \u2014 has never worked in civil rights enforcement and has criticized affirmative action and the women\u2019s rights movement. Ms. Jackson has not spoken publicly about her stances on social or educational issues, but her Twitter posts offer a glimpse of her views on certain issues. In January, she shared an article about Mr. Trump being an ally of the gay community and commented that \u201cReasonable LGBT citizens (as opposed to the militant left-wing LGBT movement) have reason to cheer POTUS Trump; he\u2019s shifting the GOP.\u201d In another post, she wrote that \u201cTrue choice combined with fiscal federalism is the way up for American schools and is on our horizon thanks to POTUS Trump.\u201d And on Inauguration Day, she defended the Clintons, tweeting, \u201cTruly disappointed that our wonderful MAGA crowd chose to boo the Clintons. Give them credit for respecting the Office & showing up,\u201d including a reference to President Trump\u2019s campaign slogan of \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d In a recent research brief, a Georgetown University research organization, FutureEd, compiled a profile of quotes from Ms. Jackson\u2019s college days writing for The Stanford Review, her university\u2019s conservative student newspaper. \u201cAs with most liberal solutions to a problem, giving special assistance to minority students is a band-aid solution to a deep problem,\u201d Ms. Jackson wrote in The Review in 1998. The same year, she maintained that \u201ccollege women who insist on banding together by gender to fight for their rights are moving backwards, not forwards.\u201d Eric Jackson, who wrote on The Stanford Review with Ms. Jackson but is not related to her, said that Ms. Jackson has been unfairly tarred by views from decades ago. As a classmate, he recalled that she challenged the liberal viewpoints widely held on campus as a self-proclaimed \u201clibertarian feminist.\u201d But he added that Ms. Jackson is an astute lawyer who follows the rule of law and understands vulnerability. \u201cWhat we can infer from her personal background is that she\u2019s compassionate; she understands what it\u2019s like, as a gay woman, to have to overcome adversity,\u201d Mr. Jackson said. Jason Botel, Ms. DeVos\u2019s deputy assistant secretary for elementary and secondary education, made headlines for his strong support of charter schools and is believed to be a chief architect of some of the Trump administration\u2019s school-choice agenda. He is also a registered Democrat who supported President Barack Obama and has spent his career as an educator and an advocate for low-income minority children in Baltimore. Mr. Botel was named to the department after serving a short stint as the chief education adviser to President Trump, a position he owed to his ties to the president\u2019s daughter, Ivanka Trump, and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, both of whom are advisers to Mr. Trump. Mr. Botel came into the Trump orbit through Maggie Katz, a close friend of Ms. Trump\u2019s, and Reed S. Cordish, Ms. Katz\u2019s husband and a prominent Baltimore developer who joined the Trump White House as a top adviser. Ms. Katz and Mr. Cordish financially backed Mr. Botel\u2019s charter school in Baltimore. Thomas Toch, the director of FutureEd, said Mr. Botel represents Democratic school reformers who are committed to public school choice but are skeptical of vouchers and market-driven philosophies. Mr. Botel has also supported the national Common Core standards, which have been denounced by Ms. DeVos and Mr. Trump as federal overreach. \u201cJason Botel is emblematic of some of the larger tensions in the administration,\u201d Mr. Toch said. In Baltimore, Mr. Botel began his career through Teach for America, and taught for three years at a middle school with a high level of students in poverty. He later started the Baltimore foundation of the Knowledge Is Power Program, a national charter school effort known as KIPP, and launched the KIPP Ujima Village Academy, which would go on to become one of the most rigorous, high-performing and highly sought-after schools in Baltimore. \u201cThe school was a proof point for what was possible with poor black students,\u201d said Andres Alonso, a former superintendent of the Baltimore City school district. As the operator of KIPP, Mr. Botel battled the Baltimore Teachers Union over the school\u2019s extended day, which resulted in a deal that both sides praised. He stopped using placement tests for KIPP applicants after families of low-performing students said the tests were deterring such students from applying. When he became executive director of MarylandCAN, an education advocacy group, Mr. Botel used the platform to be more outspoken on social issues. He publicly supported the Black Lives Matter movement, which opposed Mr. Trump during last year\u2019s presidential campaign. In a 2014 blog post titled \u201cBlack Minds Matter,\u201d Mr. Botel wrote that his advocacy for school choice policies was \u201cpart of the effort to dismantle the white supremacist system that exists.\u201d A year later, after Baltimore erupted into riots following the death in police custody of Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old black man, Mr. Botel wrote, \u201cWhite people have gradually become more conscious of the racist foundations of so many of our institutions, but we have continued to fall short of the fundamental reforms that would bring true justice to all people in our state.\u201d Jessica Shiller, an associate professor of urban education at Towson University in Maryland, agreed that Mr. Botel was a strong advocate for poor, black children but that he too often held up charter schools and choice-friendly public schools as the best models. \u201cWhile that benefited some students in Baltimore, the scaling up of that agenda for whole school districts can be dangerous,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople didn\u2019t appreciate his one-dimensional thinking.\u201d Jose Viana, an assistant deputy education secretary and the director of the Office of English Language Acquisition, was a much more low-key appointment for Ms. DeVos, but he assumed that position at a time when immigrant students face heightened discrimination, a breakdown of protections and the loss of family members to deportation. Mr. Viana joined the department from North Carolina\u2019s Department of Public Instruction, where he spent eight years helping the children of migrant workers \u2014 including undocumented immigrants \u2014 overcome academic barriers that resulted from frequent moves and a lack of access to essential services such as health care. His job as a recruiter for the North Carolina Migrant Education Program required him to seek out students who could use the federal government\u2019s help to adjust to life in the United States. Mr. Viana often quipped that he was \u201ccreated in Cuba and born in the United States,\u201d said Sonja Williams, who worked with Mr. Viana in North Carolina. His mother emigrated to the United States when she was six months pregnant with Mr. Viana, after his father was imprisoned by the Fidel Castro regime. Mr. Viana learned to speak English in elementary school. \u201cHe brings that real truth to that experience,\u201d Ms. Williams said. Mr. Viana will serve as \u201cchief adviser to Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos on all matters related to the education of English learners,\u201d according to his public biography. Ethan Hutt, a professor of education and policy at the University of Maryland, said Ms. DeVos\u2019s appointments \u201cshow the complexity of the intersection of identity politics and the fault lines of education reform.\u201d \u201cIf nothing else, Betsy DeVos is an enigma, and her under appointments represent that to some extent.\u201d Mr. Hutt said. \u201cIt shows what she wants at the table. But the question is how much influence they will ultimately have.\u201d",

      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 President-elect Donald J. Trump moved swiftly on Wednesday to diversify his cabinet and try to heal lingering rifts in the Republican Party, reaching out to Gov. Nikki R. Haley of South Carolina and Betsy DeVos, a prominent Republican fund-raiser, both of whom opposed him during the campaign, as well as Ben Carson, who challenged Mr. Trump for the Republican nomination. Ms. Haley, who was named ambassador to the United Nations, and Ms. DeVos, who was named education secretary, would be the first women in Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet. Mr. Carson, whose selection as secretary of housing and urban development is expected to be announced on Friday, would be the first African-American. But none of these choices suggest a president-elect who is reaching beyond reliably conservative precincts to fill his administration. Ms. Haley, 44, an Indian-American who is a rising star in Republican politics, pushed for the removal of the Confederate battle flag from the South Carolina State House after the deadly church shooting in Charleston in June 2015. During the Republican primary, she was a frequent and vocal critic of Mr. Trump and supported Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. Ms. DeVos, 58, is one of the nation\u2019s most avid supporters of school choice, a subject she and Mr. Trump discussed last week at his country club in Bedminster, N.J. But Ms. DeVos also sharply criticized him during the campaign and spent much of the year raising money for other Republicans on the ballot. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump rolled out their appointments with unstinting praise. Ms. Haley, he said in a statement, was \u201ca proven deal maker, and we look to be making plenty of deals.\u201d Ms. DeVos, he said, was a \u201cbrilliant and passionate education advocate.\u201d For Mr. Trump, who was spending a quiet day before Thanksgiving at Mar-a-Lago, his estate in Palm Beach, Fla., the appointments ended a breathless two-week sprint since his stunning victory. In a videotaped holiday greeting to the American people on Wednesday, he acknowledged the wounds left by a \u201clong and bruising political campaign.\u201d His aides said he would resume meeting with potential cabinet members on Friday, when they said he would announce Mr. Carson, the retired neurosurgeon with whom Mr. Trump bitterly clashed and lavishly praised during the campaign. Soon afterward, Mr. Trump is expected to name Gen. James N. Mattis as defense secretary. But the search for a secretary of state has become less clear, people involved in the transition said. Aides are divided between Rudolph W. Giuliani, who staunchly backed Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy but whose business dealings have drawn scrutiny, and Mitt Romney, viewed by many as a safe pick but who harshly criticized Mr. Trump during the campaign. Mr. Giuliani, who has lobbied publicly for the position, confided to associates that he believed the job was his and told Mr. Trump\u2019s top advisers that it was the only post he was interested in, according to the people briefed on the discussions. But Mr. Trump grew concerned both with the attention Mr. Giuliani has been drawing to himself and the reports about potential business conflicts. Some in the president-elect\u2019s circle voiced concerns about whether Mr. Giuliani would be the subject of a messy confirmation battle. Their attention turned to an unlikely alternative: Mr. Romney. Advisers who favored Mr. Giuliani believed Mr. Trump could send a unifying message by holding a perfunctory meeting with a vocal critic like Mr. Romney. But Mr. Trump liked him and was intrigued by the prospect of a camera-ready emissary of the United States around the world. Mr. Giuliani met with Mr. Trump a day later, urging him to make a decision. Mr. Romney has not signaled to Mr. Trump directly that he would accept the job if offered, a person close to the transition said. Mr. Trump has also been warned by several advisers against choosing Mr. Romney because he might pursue his own agenda. The tension has left some on the team looking for a third choice, like Gen. John F. Kelly of the Marines, the former head of the United States Southern Command, which oversees the military prison at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba; David H. Petraeus, the retired Army general who was director of the C.I.A.; or, a particular long shot, former Senator Jim Webb of Virginia, who could be the lone Democrat in the cabinet after having briefly run for the party\u2019s presidential nomination last year. Choosing Mr. Petraeus, who resigned in 2012 in a scandal over his leaking of classified information, would be somewhat easier after Mr. Trump said he would not pursue a case against Hillary Clinton over her handling of classified emails on a private email server, one person close to the transition said. The debate over secretary of state is a microcosm of the balance Mr. Trump is trying to strike in all of his appointments \u2014 between loyalists who will appeal to his base and more mainstream Republicans, many of whom stridently opposed his candidacy. In Ms. DeVos, Ms. Haley and Mr. Carson, he is trying to appeal to several of these constituencies, from Midwestern ultraconservatives to the diverse society that Republicans have tried to reach, with mixed results. Mr. Trump\u2019s selections could blunt criticism that his early picks came from a homogeneous bloc of older, white men. If confirmed, Ms. Haley would step down as governor and be replaced by the state\u2019s lieutenant governor, Henry McMaster, who was an early supporter of Mr. Trump. Mr. Carson is a familiar face to Americans after a Republican primary campaign in which he briefly rose to the top of the polls. Neither he nor Ms. Haley is particularly experienced for the posts they have been offered. Mr. Carson had even seemed to take himself out of the running for a cabinet position last week, with his friends putting out word that he had concluded he was not qualified to run a vast federal bureaucracy. Some pointed to Ms. Haley\u2019s experience as a legislator and trade ambassador for South Carolina as credentials for the United Nations post. John D. Negroponte, a former ambassador to the United Nations under President George W. Bush who opposed Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy, said Ms. Haley was an \u201cintriguing and very good choice.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s not an ideologue,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019ll quickly grasp that there are aspects of the United Nations\u2019 work that can benefit the United States.\u201d Ms. DeVos, a former finance chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, won the support of Senator Lamar Alexander, the Tennessee Republican who is chairman of the Senate Education Committee. He called her an \u201cexcellent choice.\u201d She favors charter schools, which are publicly funded but typically run independently of local school boards and teachers\u2019 unions, and school vouchers, which give students tax dollars to apply toward private-school tuition. Lily Eskelsen Garcia, president of the National Education Association, the country\u2019s largest teachers\u2019 union, criticized the nomination, saying that Ms. DeVos\u2019s efforts over the years had \u201cdone more to undermine public education than support students.\u201d \u201cShe has lobbied for failed schemes, like vouchers \u2014 which take away funding and local control from our public schools \u2014 to fund private schools at taxpayers\u2019 expense,\u201d she said. \u201cThese schemes do nothing to help our most vulnerable students while they ignore or exacerbate glaring opportunity gaps.\u201d",

      "content": " For a year now, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has been trying to give away her $199,700 salary. With every government-issued paycheck, which she pledged she would not take, the billionaire cabinet secretary grew more frustrated by ethics rules that restricted her ability to donate to charities in her official capacity. But this week, after finally getting the go-ahead to donate in her personal capacity, she was able to call four organizations of her choosing to inform them they would evenly split the money: Kids Hope USA, a faith-based organization that connects mentors with schools that Ms. DeVos was long affiliated with, including as a mentor; the Special Olympics, the global sports organization for people with intellectual disabilities; Vision to Learn, a program that provides free eye exams and eyeglasses to students in low-income communities; and Dreams Soar, which supports girls in aviation and science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields. For Ms. DeVos, the protracted effort to give her money away is illustrative of her first year in government: She struggles with bureaucracy. She has met opposition at every turn, but in a wide-ranging interview this week to mark the end of her first year as secretary, she said her agenda had not been derailed. Ms. DeVos, a philanthropist and longtime supporter of private, parochial and public charter schools, remains unapologetic about the things that have made her a target of criticism. She still believes in parents\u2019 right to choose alternatives to neighborhood public schools, with publicly funded tuition vouchers if need be. She still believes the federal government should have a limited role in telling any school how to educate its students. And she believes that what many thought disqualified her for the job \u2014 her lack of experience with public neighborhood schools, which educate the majority of the nation\u2019s students \u2014 has been an asset. \u201cI don\u2019t know what can\u2019t be done,\u201d Ms. DeVos said. \u201cAnd I come in with fresh eyes around all of these issues, and I think that questioning the way things have been done, and being able to look at things from a different perspective, is a good thing.\u201d Here are five takeaways from a question-and-answer session Ms. DeVos conducted with a group of reporters about her first year in office. 1. She has not given up on expanding school choice. Ms. DeVos has reeled in her rhetoric around a national voucher and charter-school initiative, and in recent speeches she has emphasized \u201crethinking\u201d the way schools educate students across the board. \u201cI would say it\u2019s a broadening of the message,\u201d Ms. DeVos said. \u201cWhen we talk about the need for innovation in education, it has to happen in every traditional school, it has to happen in every private school, it has to happen in every charter school.\u201d Ms. DeVos called the expansion of 529 plans in the December tax law to cover K-12 expenses a \u201cbig win\u201d for private and parochial school choice but agreed with analysts who said that the legislation was limited in its impact, especially for low-income students from families with limited means to save. She signaled that she had settled for using her platform to champion the cause. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been a secretary that has talked about empowering parents and giving them choices before,\u201d Ms. DeVos said. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s a huge benefit, and frankly a privilege to do \u2014 to try to be a voice for many parents who don\u2019t have voices.\u201d 2. She is proud and pained by regulatory rollbacks. Ms. DeVos said she believed that reducing the department\u2019s footprint had been \u201csome of the most important work we\u2019ve done in this first year.\u201d But she said that the most significant rollback thus far \u2014 Title IX guidance issued under President Barack Obama for investigating sexual assaults on campus \u2014 had been \u201cprobably one of the most heartbreaking parts of this job.\u201d \u201cAs a mom and a grandma, I think about my children, and we need to get this right. We need to get it right for all students, and it clearly hasn\u2019t worked in far too many cases,\u201d she said. Victims and advocates have said that Ms. DeVos\u2019s rescission of the campus sexual assault guidance, which she replaced with interim guidance that changed the standard of proof for investigations, has had a chilling effect on victims who are reluctant to report assaults. \u201cThat would certainly be the last thing I would desire or want,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that the interim guidance that we provided ultimately does that in any way.\u201d Ms. DeVos said the department was still examining the Obama-era guidance that addressed the disproportionate impact of discipline policies and special education placements on minority students. Civil rights organizations have pointed to Ms. DeVos\u2019s re-examination of these policies as evidence of her lack of empathy for vulnerable populations. \u201cIt\u2019s hurtful to me when I\u2019m criticized for not upholding the rights of students,\u201d she said. \u201cFor not caring about students with special needs. Nothing could be further from the truth.\u201d Ms. DeVos remains hard pressed to find an area where she thinks regulation is appropriate, but she identified enforcing civil rights laws and the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act as a critical role for the department. 3. She believes she is implementing the new federal education law, the Every Student Succeeds Act, with fidelity. Ms. DeVos has faced criticism over her department\u2019s approval of state plans for implementing the Every Student Succeeds Act. Senator Patty Murray, a Democrat of Washington who was a chief architect of the law, said that Ms. DeVos had approved plans that do not account for the achievement of low-performing students, as the law requires. \u201cI\u2019m only approving plans that comport with the law,\u201d Ms. DeVos said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m encouraging anyone who has been critical of me and/or the department on approval of plans.\u201d Ms. DeVos declined to comment on the quality of specific state plans. \u201cI think, very honestly, there\u2019s lots of areas for continued improvement and a plan is nothing but a bunch of words on paper,\u201d she said. 4. She feels hamstrung by Congress. Ms. DeVos\u2019s frustrations these days are directed at the body that confirmed her only with a tiebreaking vote from Vice President Mike Pence. She said a major source of frustration had been the unfilled positions in her department. Five nominees await Senate confirmation, including her would-be deputy and the nominee to head the department\u2019s office for civil rights. \u201cWe have many qualified, capable individuals waiting to come and contribute here and they\u2019re just messing around up on that building on the hill,\u201d Ms. DeVos said. Ms. DeVos also expressed frustration with how much Congress controls the budget, which she said was an example of \u201chow Washington doesn\u2019t work.\u201d It is also in the Constitution. \u201cIf we were given a top-line number and were able to designate by our own priorities around line items, it would probably look somewhat different than what the budget looks like,\u201d Ms. DeVos said. 5. She plans to push experiential and personalized learning in K-12 and higher education this year. Ms. DeVos has already begun stumping for initiatives that would give students different pathways to the work force, a mission President Trump has thrown his weight behind in calling for more  \u201cvocational schools.\u201d Ms. DeVos said too many students were being steered toward a traditional college degree. \"I think personalized learning, competency, mastery, that\u2019s a big shift from where education has been,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s absolutely where most of education has to go.\u201d",

      "content": " NASHVILLE \u2014 Education Secretary Betsy DeVos often rattles off the list of detractors standing in the way of expanding school choices for the nation\u2019s children: the unions, the Democrats, the protesters and the bureaucrats. But her allies and observers in the movement to overhaul education say it is time to add another to the list: her boss. Ms. DeVos received a warm welcome here on Thursday at the 10th annual convening of center-right education reformers hosted by the Foundation for Excellence in Education, which was founded by former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida. But despite two standing ovations for Ms. DeVos\u2019s impassioned calls to abandon systems that she said kept students trapped in unfit or misfit schools, it was not lost on audience members that their highest-profile surrogate had returned to her constituency empty-handed. Her promised actions have gone nowhere. The culprit, they said, is the inflammatory president Ms. DeVos works for, who paralyzed efforts at cooperation and whose language and policies are seen as antagonistic toward low-income minority communities \u2014 the very families the secretary has spent 30 years championing. \u201cBetsy absolutely cares about those families,\u201d said Howard Fuller, a professor at Marquette University in Milwaukee who helped found the Black Alliance for Educational Options, a group that supports school choice. \u201cBut her boss doesn\u2019t, and she\u2019s not a free agent.\u201d Funding requests for private school vouchers and charter schools that Ms. DeVos said would jump-start \u201cthe most ambitious expansion of education choice in our nation\u2019s history\u201d have largely been ignored by Congress. A tax-credit scholarship program, like the one Mr. Bush expanded in Florida, was supposed to go national \u2014 but has not taken flight. The one proposal that has made some progress, an expansion of tax-favored 529 savings plans in the Republican tax overhaul to allow families to put away savings for private school tuition, has divided conservatives, some of whom say the expansion will not reach the low-income families that the school choice movement was created for. The beneficiaries would be families with money to sock away at the end of the month. \u201cThe best and worst thing she\u2019s done has electrified the conversation, and the fact that she had everybody coming for her from Day 1 shows what\u2019s at stake,\u201d said Derrell Bradford, executive vice president of the advocacy group 50CAN, or the 50-State Campaign for Achievement Now. \u201cBut not as much has gotten done as we would like, and certainly what we wanted to get accomplished legislatively and thought would happen right away is not happening.\u201d Among choice advocates, Ms. DeVos still appeared to have broad support, and some of her allies blamed deep, divisive partisanship for her shortcomings. \u201cI don\u2019t think people are giving her a real chance inside or outside the department,\u201d said Robert Enlow, the president of the advocacy group EdChoice. \u201cIdeology and partisanship has really gotten in the way.\u201d But most echoed Jack McCarthy, who runs an AppleTree early learning center and charter school in Washington. He said Ms. DeVos\u2019s principles were not unlike others that he had heard from former secretaries of education, including her immediate predecessors, Arne Duncan and John B. King Jr., who supported charter schools. But their boss, Barack Obama, was not the polarizing figure Mr. Trump is in the education community. \u201cThe difference is the president,\u201d Mr. McCarthy said. \u201cShe\u2019s facing the general backlash to whoever is in a leadership position in that administration. And that\u2019s a shame.\u201d Ms. DeVos, who sat on the board of Mr. Bush\u2019s foundation and contributed to his failed 2016 presidential campaign, used her first address to the group as secretary to assure her audience that she had not been deterred. \u201cAllow me to borrow a line from the great American author Mark Twain: The reports of my death are greatly exaggerated,\u201d she said, calling out \u201cunions, union bosses, the defenders of the status quo, the education-expert bloggers and muckrakers, and many of our friends on the Democratic side of the aisle in Congress.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d she said. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019m just getting started.\u201d Mr. Bush called her the \u201cepitome of a principled reformer who puts kids first.\u201d In an interview, Mr. Bush \u2014 who during the campaign called Mr. Trump \u201ca chaos candidate\u201d who would become \u201ca chaos president\u201d \u2014 acknowledged that Ms. DeVos had limited power and was operating in a \u201chyperpartisan environment.\u201d He said he expected that she would leave her mark in some legislative effort. \u201cThat hasn\u2019t happened yet, but not much has happened,\u201d Mr. Bush said. \u201cI don\u2019t blame her for that. This has been a period of adjustment, and I think she\u2019s done a great job in changing who\u2019s important.\u201d Mr. Bush said that Ms. DeVos\u2019s real battle was not in Washington and that she had focused her attention in the right places: in the states, building coalitions to garner support for school choice policies that will ultimately be up to states to put in place. Still, in her remarks to the crowd of nearly 1,000, Ms. DeVos signaled her impatience. \u201cWe are at a time for choosing,\u201d Ms. DeVos said. \u201cWe can choose to turn away, to offer platitudes or promises of action next year. Or we can say: no more. No more empty rhetoric, no more folding to political pressure, no more accepting by inaction this fundamental injustice that stains the future of the greatest republic in the history of the world. No more.\u201d But education policy experts say they see little Ms. DeVos can accomplish. The administration\u2019s deregulatory push and support of the Every Student Succeeds Act, a new federal law that pushes most decision-making to states, leave her department weakened. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t set up to have power. She was set up to reverse everything,\u201d said Chris Stewart, the chief executive of Wayfinder Foundation and a longtime education activist who moderated a panel of parents at the convention. \u201cShe has a bully pulpit, but you can\u2019t get much done talking.\u201d Robin Lake, the director of the Center on Reinventing Public Education, said Ms. DeVos\u2019s strong messaging could sometimes be off-putting, especially at a time when personal attacks are a common retort of the administration. \u201cI see a lot of coming out swinging at the teachers union, but it turns off people like me to not hear her talk about the limitations to choice,\u201d Ms. Lake said. \u201cIf the plan is to just rally the base and asserting that choice is the answer, they\u2019re not going to move things.\u201d Ms. DeVos\u2019s obligation to carry out the administration\u2019s deregulation agenda has been among the biggest challenges for the choice movement, many here said. She has repealed guidance issued to states by the Obama administration on matters of civil rights that has been criticized by conservatives as federal overreach. She also delayed carrying out regulations designed to protect student borrowers, especially low-income students, that critics say are too broad and punitive. \u201cA lot of the regulatory changes that are happening in the office don\u2019t seem to be coming from the person that I did state advocacy with like five or six years ago,\u201d Mr. Bradford said. \u201cThe president\u2019s administration\u2019s a complicated one that has lots of people doing things they wouldn\u2019t naturally do.\u201d And across the country, advocates are having a hard time reconciling Ms. DeVos\u2019s philosophical and political affiliations. \u201cThe fact that she\u2019s in the Trump administration has not helped the parent choice,\u201d said Mr. Fuller, the Marquette professor. \u201cPeople who are on the ground, one of the things we now have to fight is guilt by association with Donald Trump.\u201d At a Murfreesboro, Tenn., high school the day before her keynote address, Ms. DeVos offered a rare admonition from a cabinet member on Mr. Trump\u2019s language. According to The Tennessean, Ms. DeVos was asked whether the president was a good role model for children after he mocked Senator Elizabeth Warren as \u201cPocahontas\u201d while honoring Navajo veterans. \u201cI think the president continues to lead in an important direction in our country,\u201d Ms. DeVos said. \u201cAnd I think that we can all do well to reflect on the things we say before we say them.\u201d",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Betsy DeVos, the education secretary, on Wednesday fiercely defended budget plans to spend $1.4 billion on the Trump administration\u2019s expanded school choice agenda, but refused to say whether her office would withhold funds from private schools that discriminate against students. In her first testimony to Congress since a bruising confirmation hearing in January, Ms. DeVos appeared unflappable as she told members of a House Appropriations subcommittee that the budget sought to empower states and parents to make decisions about students\u2019 educations. \u201cWe cannot allow any parent to feel their child is trapped in a school that isn\u2019t meeting his or her unique needs,\u201d Ms. DeVos told lawmakers. But Democrats derided the education spending blueprint for the 2018 fiscal year as tone deaf to low-income and working-class Americans. Representative Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the panel, called it \u201ccruel\u201d and \u201cinhumane.\u201d The budget plan would eliminate more than 20 education programs and redirect funding to expanding school choice initiatives. Those include a $250 million program to give students publicly funded scholarships to attend private schools. But Ms. DeVos said states, not the Education Department, would decide whether to withhold federal money from private schools that are neither required to serve a diverse pool of students nor held publicly accountable for doing so. Earlier this week, in a speech to school choice advocates, Ms. DeVos said that state participation in the voucher program and other federally funded school choice initiatives would be optional. But, she said, states that chose not to participate would be making a \u201cterrible mistake.\u201d Representative Katherine M. Clark, Democrat of Massachusetts, asked how Ms. DeVos would respond to a state that gave federal funding to a school that denied admission to students from lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender families. \u201cFor states that have programs that allow for parents to make choices, they set up the rules around that,\u201d Ms. DeVos replied. Though she said the Education Department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights would vigorously investigate any discrimination claims, Ms. DeVos declined to say how, specifically, she might protect students\u2019 rights by intervening in state funding decisions. \u201cI\u2019m shocked that you were unable to find one example\u201d of discrimination against students that the secretary of education should oppose, Ms. Clark said. Ms. DeVos maintained that parents should have the final say in what kind of schools their children attend. \u201cToo many children today are trapped in schools that don\u2019t work for them,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to do something different.\u201d She offered similar reasoning when asked whether schools that received voucher money would be required to uphold special education students\u2019 due process rights. \u201cIf a parent chooses to go to a school that is not a public school, then that is a decision made and a contract made with that provider,\u201d she said. The education budget calls for cutting about $9 billion, or 13 percent of the department\u2019s funding, from about 20 programs, including the Special Olympics for students with disabilities, after-school programs for low-income students and programs for gifted students. Since the budget\u2019s release Tuesday, opponents have expressed alarm at how much it targets student-centered programs. The department\u2019s cuts to programs that help students pay for college, such as work-study and subsidized loans, have drawn the most ire. John B. King Jr., who served as education secretary under President Barack Obama and now leads the Education Trust, a think tank, said it was an \u201cassault on the American dream.\u201d \u201cNo one in good conscience could stand up and say this budget makes sense for the interests of students and the long-term interest of the country,\u201d Mr. King said. However, supporters called the cuts long overdue. The conservative Heritage Foundation said the spending blueprint \u201csignals a serious commitment to reducing federal intervention in education \u2014 a necessary condition to make space for a restoration of state and local control.\u201d Ms. DeVos told committee members that while the cuts might be alarming, they reflected \u201ctough choices\u201d on programs that had been deemed ineffective or duplicative. More money has not translated into success for the nation\u2019s public schools, she said, citing a $7 billion program targeting low-performing schools that did not improve student outcomes. Republican members of the committee agreed, and praised Ms. DeVos for her emphasis on school choice and better outcomes for students. \u201cI think there is no question that we don\u2019t get a bang for our buck in the American education system,\u201d said Representative Andy Harris, Republican of Maryland. \u201cWe are failing in a global education economy.\u201d",

Trump\u2019s nominee to be education secretary, would not oppose him. The DeVoses, a dominant force in Michigan politics for decades with a fortune in the billions, had contributed to one of Mr. Casperson\u2019s earlier campaigns. But a week before his primary, family members sent $24,000 to one of his opponents, then poured $125,000 into a \u201csuper PAC,\u201d Concerned Taxpayers of America, that ran ads attacking him. The reason, an intermediary told Mr. Casperson: his support from organized labor. \u201cDeceitful, dishonest and cowardly,\u201d was how Mr. Casperson\u2019s campaign described the ads, complaining that the groups running them \u201cwon\u2019t say who they are or where their money is coming from.\u201d On Primary Day, Mr. Casperson went down to defeat. In announcing his intention to nominate Ms. DeVos, Mr. Trump described her as \u201ca brilliant and passionate education advocate.\u201d Even critics characterized her as a dedicated, if misguided, activist for school reform. But that description understates both the breadth of Ms. DeVos\u2019s political interests and the influence she wields as part of her powerful family. More than anyone else who has joined the incoming Trump administration, she represents the combination of wealth, free-market ideology and political hardball associated with a better-known family of billionaires: Charles and David Koch. \u201cThey have this moralized sense of the free market that leads to this total program to turn back the ideas of the New Deal, the welfare state,\u201d Kim Phillips-Fein, a historian who has written extensively about the conservative movement, said, describing the DeVoses. Ms. DeVos declined to be interviewed for this article. Like the Kochs, the DeVoses are generous supporters of think tanks that evangelize for unrestrained capitalism, like Michigan\u2019s Acton Institute, and that rail against unions and back privatizing public services, like the Mackinac Center. They have also funded national groups dedicated to cutting back the role of government, including the National Center for Policy Analysis (which has pushed for Social Security privatization and against environmental regulation) and the Institute for Justice (which challenges regulations in court and defends school vouchers). Both organizations have also received money from the Koch family. Indeed, the DeVoses\u2019 education activism, which favors alternatives to traditional public schools, appears to derive from the same free-market views that inform their suspicion of government. And perhaps more than other right-wing billionaires, the DeVoses couple their seeding of ideological causes with an aggressive brand of political spending. Half a dozen or more extended family members frequently coordinate contributions to maximize their impact. In the 2016 cycle alone, according to the Michigan Campaign Finance Network, the family spent roughly $14 million on political contributions to state and national candidates, parties, PACs and super PACs. All of this would make Ms. DeVos \u2014 whose confirmation hearing has been delayed until next week amid mounting pressure that her government ethics review be completed beforehand \u2014 very different from past education secretaries. \u201cShe is the most emblematic kind of oligarchic figure you can put in a cabinet position,\u201d said Jeffrey Winters, a political scientist at Northwestern University who studies economic elites. \u201cWhat she and the Kochs have in common is the unbridled use of wealth power to achieve whatever political goals they have.\u201d Ms. DeVos, 59, grew up in Holland, Mich., the daughter of a conservative auto parts magnate who was an early funder of the Family Research Council, a conservative Christian group. When she married Dick DeVos in 1979, it was akin to a merger between two royal houses of western Michigan. Her husband\u2019s father, Richard Sr., co-founder of the multilevel marketing company Amway, was an active member of the Christian Reformed Church that preached a mix of social conservatism and self-reliance. He once told the church\u2019s official magazine that Chicago\u2019s poor dwelled in slums because that was \u201cthe way they choose to live,\u201d according to a Washington Post story from the 1980s. A fan of Rolls-Royces and pinkie rings, Richard Sr. wrote books with titles like \u201cTen Powerful Phrases for Positive People.\u201d A similar air hung over his business. Amway sales representatives, which the company calls \u201cindependent business owners,\u201d make money both by selling the company\u2019s products \u2014 everything from perfume to toilet bowl cleaner \u2014 and by recruiting other sales representatives. The Federal Trade Commission once investigated the company for running a pyramid scheme before concluding that it had misled potential recruits about how much they could expect to earn. The flip side of the family\u2019s proselytizing for capitalism, according to Professor Phillips-Fein, has been an effort to dismantle much \u201cthat would counterbalance the power of economic elites.\u201d Amway funded a nationwide ad campaign in the early 1980s, protesting high taxes and regulations. Not long after, the company pleaded guilty to cheating the Canadian government out of more than $20 million in revenue. The family had a more winning public face in Dick DeVos, who combined the practiced empathy of a pitchman with the entitlement of an heir, spending over $30 million on an unsuccessful run for governor of Michigan in 2006. The Detroit Free Press described him that year as the wealthiest man to seek office in the state\u2019s modern history. Betsy DeVos, who served as chairwoman of the Michigan Republican Party for most of the decade between 1996 and 2005, has often played the role of strategist in the relationship. She was a key adviser in her husband\u2019s run for governor and publicly brooded that he had been too gentlemanly in his first debate against the incumbent. \u201cHe\u2019s very good with people, a retail politician who looks you in the eye, shakes your hand, listens to what you say,\u201d said Randy Richardville, a former Republican leader of the Michigan Senate, describing the couple\u2019s strengths. \u201cI would never underestimate Betsy DeVos in a knife fight.\u201d Ms. DeVos has sometimes lacked her husband\u2019s finesse, once famously blaming many of the state\u2019s economic woes on \u201chigh wages.\u201d She has won detractors, by their account, by browbeating legislators into voting her way. \u201cBetsy DeVos was like my 4-year-old granddaughter at the time,\u201d said Mike Pumford, a former Republican state representative who once clashed with her. \u201cThey were both sweet ladies as long as they kept hearing the word \u2018yes.\u2019 They turned into spoiled little brats when they were told \u2018no.\u2019\u201d But Ms. DeVos has often made up for what she lacks in tact through sheer force of will. Mr. Richardville said he and Ms. DeVos disagreed over term limits, which she supported as party chairwoman and he opposed: \u201cI said, \u2018I don\u2019t think you should be setting policy. You should be supporting those of us who do make policy.\u2019 But she never backed down.\u201d While Dick and Betsy DeVos appear to practice a more tolerant form of Christianity than their parents \u2014 Ms. DeVos has spoken out against anti-gay bigotry \u2014 as recently as the early 2000s they funded some groups like Focus on the Family, a large ministry that helps set the political agenda for conservative evangelicals. They have also backed groups that promote conservative values to students and Christian education, including one with ties to the Christian Reformed Church. Their economic views are strikingly similar to the elder Mr. DeVos\u2019s. According to federal disclosures, Amway, which Dick DeVos ran between 1993 and 2002, has lobbied frequently over the last 20 years to reduce or repeal the estate tax. Only the top 0.2 percent wealthiest estates paid the tax in 2015. The company has also opposed crackdowns on tax shelters. Ms. DeVos has been an outspoken defender of unlimited contributions known as soft money, which she described in a 1997 editorial as \u201chard-earned American dollars that Big Brother has yet to find a way to control.\u201d After Congress later passed a major campaign finance reform bill, a nonprofit that Ms. DeVos helped to create and fund masterminded the strategy that produced Citizens United, the 2010 Supreme Court decision laying the groundwork for super PACs funded by corporations, unions and individuals to raise and spend unlimited amounts in elections. And then there are the family\u2019s efforts to rein in the labor movement. Through their contributions to think tanks like the Mackinac Center, as well as Mr. DeVos\u2019s direct prodding of Republican legislators, the family played a key role in helping pass Michigan\u2019s so-called right-to-work legislation in 2012. The legislation largely ended the requirement that workers pay fees to unions as a condition of employment. Unions in the state bled members in 2014, the first full year the measure was in effect. Allies say the DeVoses fight for their beliefs. \u201cBetsy and Dick see themselves as principled conservatives,\u201d said Frederick Hess of the American Enterprise Institute. \u201cIt kind of seems healthy and admirable to give resources to folks who are going to fight for causes you believe in.\u201d But the fights can appear to be as much about consolidating power as ideology. Unions were arguably the family\u2019s most formidable political opponent in Michigan, one of labor\u2019s traditional strongholds. The DeVos family\u2019s roots as education activists date back at least to when Richard DeVos Sr. was running Amway and an institute based at the company\u2019s headquarters trained teachers to inject free-market principles into their curriculum. According to an interview Ms. DeVos gave to Philanthropy magazine, she and her husband became interested in education causes when they began visiting a Christian school that served low-income children in Grand Rapids in the 1980s. \u201cIf we could choose the right school for our kids\u201d \u2014 by which she appeared to mean primarily private schools \u2014 \u201cit only seemed fair that they could do the same for theirs,\u201d she told the magazine. The family spent millions of dollars on a ballot proposal in 2000 asking if Michigan should legalize vouchers, in which students can use taxpayer money to attend private schools. Many critics, like the education historian Diane Ravitch, argue that the point of vouchers is to destroy public education and teachers\u2019 unions. The group Americans United for Separation of Church and State has documented how conservative Christians have long supported vouchers, which could fund religious schools. After voters objected by more than a two-to-one ratio, Dick DeVos gave a speech at the Heritage Foundation saying such efforts would have to shift to state legislatures, where groups backed by deep-pocketed donors could offer \u201ca political consequence for opposition, and political reward for support of education reform issues.\u201d It is not unusual for the wealthy \u2014 who devote nearly 50 percent of their philanthropic dollars to education, according to the group Wealth-X \u2014 to spend aggressively in the political realm to impose their preferred reforms. Even by these standards, however, the DeVoses stand out for the amount of money they spend trying to advance their goals through politics rather than philanthropy, such as research into reforms or subsidizing schools. As Sarah Reckhow, an expert on education philanthropy at Michigan State University, put it: \u201cThe DeVoses are like: \u2018No, we know what we want. We don\u2019t need to have all this window dressing.\u2019\u201d Ms. DeVos has led two nonprofits that have spent millions of dollars electing governors and legislators sympathetic to school vouchers around the country. Matt Frendewey, a spokesman for one of the groups, said the efforts had frequently been bipartisan, and that the amount of money they had spent has been dwarfed by contributions from teachers\u2019 unions opposed to reform. Yet in Michigan, at least, the family\u2019s political strategy has not been subtle. After he defied Ms. DeVos on a key charter school vote, Mr. Pumford, the former Republican legislator, survived an effort by the Great Lakes Education Project, a nonprofit the DeVoses bankrolled, to defeat him in his 2002 primary. But shortly after, the House speaker told him the Education Committee chairmanship he coveted would not be forthcoming. \u201cI said, \u2018Why?\u2019\u201d Mr. Pumford recalled. \u201cHe said: \u2018You know why. The DeVoses will walk away from us.\u2019\u201d Mr. Pumford added: \u201cShe told me that was going to happen.\u201d (Rick Johnson, the House speaker, said he did not recall the conversation but also that he had not promised Mr. Pumford the chairmanship and would not have explained his reasons for withholding it.) Over time, the Great Lakes Education Project helped elect Republican majorities sympathetic to the DeVoses\u2019 agenda. But the DeVoses\u2019 lobbyists and operatives also discovered less messy ways to advance legislation. Late one night of their last workweek in 2015, the Michigan House and Senate were about to approve some uncontroversial changes to campaign finance law, when the bill abruptly grew by more than 40 pages. After the legislators discovered what they had voted for, many said they were horrified. Tucked away in the new pages was a provision that would have made it much harder for local bodies like school boards to raise money through property tax increases. \u201cMichigan schools will likely suffer the brunt of the impact because the vast majority rely on periodic voter approval of local operating levy renewals for property taxes,\u201d the ratings agency Moody\u2019s wrote of the measure the following month. \u201cI was fooled into voting for something I opposed,\u201d said Dave Pagel, a Republican representative. \u201cI consider it the worst vote I\u2019ve made.\u201d The chief culprits, according to Mr. Pagel and others at the state Capitol when the bill passed, were lobbyists closely tied to the DeVoses. Tony Daunt, a spokesman for the Michigan Freedom Fund, a nonprofit headed by the DeVoses\u2019 longtime political aide, and whose political spending arm they have funded generously, said the group was \u201cpart of the discussion process with people in the legislature\u201d about the proposal and \u201chad consistently expressed support for the policy.\u201d The law was later blocked by a federal judge, but the group has vowed to try again. Ms. DeVos\u2019s advocates see in these fights the toughness to take on entrenched opponents of expanding reforms like charter schools and vouchers. In promoting Ms. DeVos in The Washington Post, Mitt Romney, the Republican Party\u2019s 2012 presidential nominee, emphasized that her wealth gave her the independence to be \u201csomeone who isn\u2019t financially biased shaping education.\u201d He added, \u201cDeVos doesn\u2019t need the job now, nor will she be looking for an education job later.\u201d But critics see someone with an unmistakable agenda. \u201cThe signs are there that she will do something radical,\u201d said Jack Jennings, a former general counsel for the House education committee. \u201cTrump wouldn\u2019t have appointed this woman for this position if he didn\u2019t intend something radical.\u201d",

      "content": " Hours before President Trump rescinded a federal policy allowing transgender students to use the school bathrooms that match their gender identities, his education secretary, Betsy DeVos, met with a representative of gay and transgender employees at the Education Department to warn of what was coming. In her presence, an aide assured the employee that, as was widely reported, Ms. DeVos had resisted the move, according to people briefed on the Wednesday meeting. Yet she gave no public sign that there had been a rift within the Trump administration, or that she had come up short. She joined in the announcement of the new policy, and on Thursday, she told the annual Conservative Political Action Conference that the earlier federal guidelines were \u201ca very huge example of the Obama administration\u2019s overreach.\u201d But people who have known and watched Ms. DeVos through the years \u2014 as a leading advocate of charter schools and school vouchers, a former Michigan Republican Party chairwoman and a major Republican donor \u2014 warn against thinking that she will be a meek team player. She may be publicly gracious, even in the face of setbacks, they say. But in her home state, she earned a reputation as a driven, relentless and effective political fighter, using her family\u2019s vast fortune to reward allies and punish foes, and working behind the scenes to pass legislation and unseat lawmakers who opposed her. \u201cIn Michigan politics, she instilled fear in a lot of people, and it\u2019s not just because she\u2019s a billionaire,\u201d said Mike Cox, a Republican and former state attorney general. \u201cI found Betsy to be very determined, steely, when she sets her mind on a goal.\u201d Ms. DeVos, who declined to be interviewed for this article, arrived in Washington with no experience inside government and very little history with the president, and she took over a department whose upper ranks are mostly vacant. In the argument over transgender bathroom access, that put her at a disadvantage against Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a former senator with decades of Washington experience and connections who has long had Mr. Trump\u2019s ear. But critics and admirers alike say they expect her to learn the ropes, build ties and get her way. \u201cThere is a real tendency to underestimate her,\u201d said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, usually a stalwart supporter of Democrats. \u201cShe comes across as personable, plain-spoken, but she is dangerous.\u201d Ms. DeVos, 59, grew up in Holland, Mich., in the western part of the state. She worked at times at the auto parts company her father, Edgar Prince, a major backer of Christian conservative causes, founded and built into a billion-dollar business. Her brother, Erik D. Prince, founded and was chief executive of the private security firm Blackwater, a controversial contractor for American personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan. Her husband, Dick DeVos, comes from an even wealthier family \u2014 his father was a founder of Amway, the multilevel marketing company \u2014 and he ran unsuccessfully for governor of Michigan in 2006. Opponents have noted Ms. DeVos\u2019s lack of connections to public schools and colleges \u2014 she and her husband had private educations, as did their children \u2014 or to the problems average families have in paying for education. For three decades, Ms. DeVos fought to steer tax dollars away from traditional public schools to charter schools, which rely on public money but are operated by private groups, outside public school structures. She also sought public funds for vouchers to pay for tuition at private schools, including religious schools. Opponents call charter schools a conservative plan to undermine public education by starving it of resources, while supporters argue that they give poor families choices and create competition that pressures traditional schools to improve. But Ms. DeVos has taken the cause further than many charter school advocates. She has supported schools run by for-profit companies and opposed performance standards for them. She has also argued that the free market \u2014 parents\u2019 deciding whether to send their children to charter schools \u2014 should decide their fate. Largely because of her efforts, Detroit has the nation\u2019s largest concentration of charter schools. Many of them are low-performing, and the supply exceeds the demand in some places, within a system that has little oversight and has been derided as chaotic. At the same time, Detroit\u2019s public schools, among the worst in the nation, have continued to deteriorate. Last year, Detroit officials and a bipartisan group of state lawmakers backed legislation to create mechanisms for permitting new charter schools and closing failing ones. But a group Ms. DeVos created, the Great Lakes Education Project, fought against the bill and won. Ms. DeVos said the Detroit public school system should simply be shut down. \u201cShe fought with everything she had to stop that from going into law, because she didn\u2019t want the public schools to succeed,\u201d Ms. Weingarten said. \u201cShe\u2019s completely ideologically focused.\u201d In her confirmation hearings, Ms. DeVos noted that the vast majority of American students go to public schools, and said nothing would change that. But after taking over the Education Department, she reinforced fears that she is hostile to public education, saying that at a Washington public school she had visited, teachers were in \u201cmore of a receive mode\u201d rather than taking initiative, \u201cwaiting to be told what they have to do.\u201d Greg McNeilly, a Republican political operative in Michigan who has worked extensively with Ms. DeVos, said she understood what too many Americans did not: that even public schools in the United States that are considered good do not perform as well as those in other developed countries, as measured by student test scores. \u201cI think she wants to have a conversation with the country about what should we expect from our schools, and about being agnostic about the form of schools,\u201d he said. Ms. DeVos has had a rocky introduction to Washington, to put it mildly. In her Senate confirmation hearings, her shaky answers to questions about education policy and federal law, and her suggestion that some school officials carried guns to protect against grizzly bears \u2014 allies say it was meant as a joke \u2014 made her a target for late-night television comedy. The Senate confirmed her, 51-50, with Vice President Mike Pence casting a tiebreaking vote \u2014 a first for a cabinet officer. Friends say she was irked at being portrayed as ignorant. But she rarely considers such criticism worth responding to, in contrast to the president. Publicly, she shrugged off the mockery, even joking in her first meeting with Education Department employees that her confirmation had been \u201ca bit of a bear.\u201d On Thursday, she said, \u201cThe media has had its fun with me, and that\u2019s O.K.\u201d One of her first acts as secretary was to call the leaders of the two major teachers\u2019 unions, Ms. Weingarten and Lily Eskelsen Garc\u00eda, president of the National Education Association. Ms. Eskelsen Garc\u00eda said she saw no point in talking yet, but Ms. Weingarten returned the call, and she and Ms. DeVos made plans to visit schools together. \u201cIt was a smart move\u201d by the secretary, Mr. McNeilly said. \u201cPeople in Washington will find out, opposition only emboldens her,\u201d he said. \u201cShe knows how to play power politics.\u201d",

      "content": " HOLLAND, Mich. \u2014 The students formed a circle around the Rev. Ray Vanderlaan, who draped himself in a Jewish ceremonial prayer shawl to cap his final lesson to graduating seniors in his discipleship seminar at Holland Christian High School. \u201cWe\u2019re sending you out into a broken world, in part because of my generation,\u201d the minister told the students. Referring to God, he exhorted them to \u201cextend his kingdom.\u201d Mr. Vanderlaan could not have missed his lesson\u2019s echoes of Holland Christian\u2019s most famous graduate, Betsy DeVos, who proclaimed in an audio recording that surfaced in December that her education advocacy would \u201cadvance God\u2019s kingdom.\u201d Last month, in her first commencement address as education secretary, Ms. DeVos again reflected her own education when she told graduates at Bethune-Cookman University in Daytona Beach, Fla., that \u201cmy generation hasn\u2019t done a great job when it comes to dealing with one another in grace.\u201d She continued, \u201cYou have an opportunity to do better.\u201d Holland Christian is one of several western Michigan nonpublic schools that have helped shape Ms. DeVos\u2019s views of elementary and secondary education, and that her critics fear she will draw from to upend the nation\u2019s public schools. The private Christian school that she attended, another that she sent her children to and a hardscrabble private religious school that she has long supported have dominated her time, money and attention. Public neighborhood schools \u2014 the vast majority of schools in this country \u2014 were hardly present in the billionaire\u2019s childhood or adult life. Critics say this lopsided exposure fueled Ms. DeVos\u2019s staunch support of privately run, publicly funded charter schools and voucher programs that allow families to take tax dollars from the public education system to private schools. In an interview, Ms. DeVos disagreed, saying the schools in which she has personal investment reflect only an agenda of empowering parents with a right that she was afforded by privilege: choice. \u201cSome say, \u2018You\u2019re trying to force all families to make choices other than public schools,\u2019 and the response to that is, \u2018Absolutely not,\u2019\u201d Ms. DeVos said. \u201cIf your public school is working great for your child, you should embrace that and support it and celebrate it. And if not, you should have the opportunity to choose something different.\u201d Ms. DeVos has maintained that she is \u201cagnostic\u201d about the type of schools that parents choose for their children. But in western Michigan, skeptics doubt professions of open-mindedness from someone who grew up in Holland \u2014 a town founded by Dutch Calvinist separatists and perceived as insular \u2014 and educated in parochial schools. \u201cThe Christian schools in Michigan were set up to be separate from the state, and now her intent is to use the state to finance them,\u201d said Mary Bouwense, president of the Grand Rapids Education Association, who has taught in public schools for 25 years. \u201cI know she says it\u2019s about choice, but it\u2019s really about funneling money to what she knows.\u201d \u201cI think her agenda is shaped by her idea of what God wants for the world,\u201d Ms. Bouwense said. Holland Christian\u2019s superintendent, Dan Meester, said he was not surprised that the school\u2019s most famous alumna has seemed unshaken by the backlash. \u201cWhat we teach here is to identify areas of this world infected with chaos and ask how, as a Christian, can I help bring shalom to that,\u201d he said, using the Hebrew word for peace. \u201cWhat we see is her out there saying, \u2018There are families and students in this country for whom the education system is chaos, and they need it to be flourishing.\u2019\u201d Ms. DeVos attended the elementary, middle and high schools at Holland Christian. Students there go to chapel three times a week, a display of crucifixes from around the world graces the main corridor and the school\u2019s sports teams are encouraged to \u201ccompete in God-honoring ways.\u201d Ms. DeVos was not as cloistered as her schooling would suggest, she said. She attended dances and football games with her public school friends because there were none at Holland Christian. She recalled that for her high school\u2019s junior banquet, students would decorate the gym, get dressed up, go out to eat and then go home. \u201cI thought: \u2018That is really dumb. We need to have dancing,\u2019\u201d she said. During her junior year, her parents began sponsoring dances off-site after the banquet, a tradition that continues. Holland Christian now serves 1,700 students across five schools for $6,000 to $8,000 a year. But about one-third of the school\u2019s families receive a total of about $1 million a year in financial aid. The attention brought by Ms. DeVos, who graduated in 1975, has put Holland Christian on the defensive in recent months. \u201cWe value faith and learning,\u201d Mr. Meester said. \u201cYou will never hear a teacher say, \u2018I don\u2019t care if you forget everything, as long as God loves you.\u2019\u201d Ms. DeVos described the role of religion in her life: \u201cMy faith motivates me to really try to work on behalf of and advocate for those who are least able to advocate for themselves.\u201d Her children were mostly educated in private Christian schools because of their proximity to home and the DeVoses\u2019 preference for faith-based learning. The children attended Ada Christian Schools for primary school, which Ms. DeVos praised for its creativity and teachers. She decided to home-school her elder daughter in sixth through eighth grades because, Ms. Devos said, the daughter had grown increasingly bored in school and the girls in her class were growing increasingly \u201ccatty.\u201d All four of Ms. DeVos\u2019s children graduated from Grand Rapids Christian High School, in the largest western Michigan city, about 45 minutes from Holland. Ms. DeVos said she had preferred Grand Rapids\u2019s Christian school over others because its philosophy was to \u201cengage with the world, not hide from the world.\u201d The DeVoses also preferred private schools because, she said, they were independent and could be more flexible when she and her husband, Dick DeVos, wanted their children to accompany them on business travel. \u201cIf you ask any of my kids today what their most important experience was in their education, they would say it was the travel and the ability to see and be in other cultures,\u201d she said. Ms. DeVos also said she had chosen Grand Rapids Christian because it was more diverse than her neighborhood school in the wealthy suburb of Ada. Today, Grand Rapids Christian\u2019s enrollment in kindergarten through 12th grade is more than 25 percent minority, 30 percent of its students qualify for free and reduced-priced meals, and 45 percent receive financial aid. Tom DeJonge, superintendent of Grand Rapids Christian Schools and a longtime friend of the DeVos family, said he was proud that the school drew students who couldn\u2019t cover full tuition, as the DeVoses did (they paid about $10,000 a year per child), and who took public transit to school. On a recent visit, the school looked like a relaxed comprehensive public high school: Students lounged in the hallway eating ice cream cones or bantered with their chemistry teacher. The school embraces both secular and nonsecular curriculums. Students learn creationism and evolution and study other religious influences like Hinduism. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to separate God and Scripture from any other aspect of life,\u201d but other influences do intrude, Mr. DeJonge said. \u201cWe do not put our heads in the sand, and neither does Betsy.\u201d Larry Borst, who taught all of the DeVos children, recalled their asking probing questions about religion. They did not expect to be treated any differently just because their last name adorned buildings across town. \u201cSure, they went on better vacations, but they\u2019re just dirt-floor people,\u201d Mr. Borst said. Ms. DeVos is still involved in the school. She has mentored one Grand Rapids Christian student, whom she met while a mentor in the public school system, for more than a decade. And the school\u2019s DeVos Center for Arts and Worship attests to the hundreds of thousands of dollars the family has donated. That involvement has not won over all her critics. \u201cThe fact that she\u2019s mentored a child or two doesn\u2019t change the fact that she is Public Enemy No. 1 for public schools,\u201d said Brandon Dillon, who represented Grand Rapids in the State House for four years and is chairman of the Michigan Democratic Party. John Booy has no time for such \u201chysterics,\u201d which he said were fueled by teachers\u2019 unions, including the one he belonged to for 27 years as a Grand Rapids Public Schools teacher. Mr. Booy met Ms. DeVos more than 30 years ago, shortly after she visited the school he founded, called the Potter\u2019s House. She had missed a fund-raising event, then called him to apologize and ask if she could visit. The Potter\u2019s House is one of the few schools that Ms. DeVos has referred to by name in her campaign for school choice, saying the school represented the kinds of families who used choice to obtain a better education for their children. The DeVoses have been \u201cpartners\u201d at the school for decades, underwriting individual students\u2019 $5,000 tuition, and even entire classes for $25,000. The school allows families to pay what they can afford, most no more than 10 percent of their net income. Mr. Booy, a self-described \u201cradical idealist,\u201d started the \u201cChrist-centered urban school\u201d 36 years ago. He had thought he could change the world after college by moving to a low-income neighborhood and becoming a public school teacher. But at gatherings he hosted at his home, he saw public school students falling through the cracks. A pastor asked him and his colleagues to start a school, and the Potter\u2019s House \u2014 named after scriptural verse in Jeremiah 18 \u2014 was born. \u201cI think getting involved with the school was an education for her,\u201d Mr. Booy said of Ms. DeVos. \u201cShe could hear stories of people and their desperation, and the problems they run against just trying to get a good education.\u201d About 60 percent of the Potter\u2019s House\u2019s 560 students are minority and low-income, from 37 countries; 30 percent speak Spanish. Five Syrian refugees enrolled in the high school this year. Each student is greeted by name and a handshake, and the school\u2019s elementary and middle schools are wallpapered in student art, murals and \u201cvision boards\u201d with smiling faces of alumni who are first-generation collegegoers. Mr. Booy said two things separated his school and his old public school: teacher involvement and parent buy-in. Though teachers are not unionized, they are certified, and all are required to sign off on their application that \u201cI accept without reservation the school\u2019s statement of faith.\u201d Parents are required to sign a similar statement, attend all three annual parent-teacher conferences and commit to 25 hours of service a year or leave the school. No one has had to leave. The school has a waiting list of more than 200. Mr. Booy rejects the notion that his school is doing harm to public schools. \u201cEven though we\u2019re not a public school, we\u2019re educating for the public good,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we need to be more about saving a child than a child saving the system.\u201d",

GreenPRINT EDITIONDeVos Pitches Tax Credit For Private Education|March 1, 2019, Page A15",
      "author": "Erica L. Green",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Education Secretary Betsy DeVos on Thursday pitched a $5 billion federal tax credit that would fund scholarships to private schools and other educational programs, throwing her weight behind what will be a difficult legislative undertaking to fund the Trump administration\u2019s signature education initiative. Ms. DeVos will join Republican lawmakers in championing legislation that would allow states to opt into a program that provides individual and corporate donors dollar-for-dollar tax credits for contributing to scholarship programs that help families pay private-school tuition and other educational expenses. The federal program mirrors those already operating in more than a dozen states, like Arizona and Florida, where money flows to nonprofit organizations that fund private-school vouchers for low-income students. But the program would also allow states the flexibility to fund other programs, like apprenticeship, dual enrollment, after-school and remedial programs. In an announcement Thursday, Ms. DeVos called it a \u201cbold\u201d proposal that gives \u201chundreds of thousands of students across the country the power to find the right fit for their education.\u201d \u201cThe biggest winners will be America\u2019s forgotten children, who will finally have choices previously available only for the rich, the powerful and the well-connected,\u201d she said. While the program is meant to offer a more politically palatable alternative to budgetary proposals by the Trump administration to create a national voucher program by diverting federal funding from public schools, public school advocates denounced it as a backdoor way to generate voucher dollars if states choose to primarily use the program for private school tuition scholarships. JoAnn Bartoletti, the executive director of the National Association of Secondary School Principals, called the proposal \u201cparticularly tone deaf\u201d as school leaders across the country struggle to retain teachers who are fed up with low pay and declining work conditions. \u201cMobilizing behind a scheme to further starve public schools and nine in 10 American students of the resources they need is not only unresponsive but insulting, and it reflects this administration\u2019s persistent disdain for public education,\u201d she said. The proposal also worried conservatives and Ms. DeVos\u2019s school choice allies, who believed it amounted to federal overreach. The Heritage Foundation, which has advocated several voucher policy initiatives, said the program could invite further regulations, impede further tax overhauls and was out of the federal government\u2019s jurisdiction. Neal McCluskey, the director of the Center for Educational Freedom at the libertarian Cato Institute, said the proposal sought to \u201cskirt the control problem\u201d by making it optional and swapping vouchers for tax credits, but still invited federal encroachment. \u201cThe credit would spur people to demand their states participate, and as more schools benefited from federally connected scholarships, all schools would be financially pressured to use them,\u201d he said in a statement. Under the program, individuals would be allowed to contribute up to 10 percent of their adjusted gross income, and they would be able to give to any program in the country. Businesses would be allowed to give up to 5 percent of their net taxable income. States would have full discretion to determine the programs and students eligible for the scholarships. Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, and one of the sponsors of the legislation, the Education Freedom Scholarship and Opportunity Act, said the program respected both federalism and public education. He also said he believed that the program would help public schools because their programs would be eligible for the funds. Competition, he said, helps them improve. \u201cThis legislation doesn\u2019t take one penny from any public school in America,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat it does is add $100 billion worth of new pennies to create scholarships and expand opportunities.\u201d Representative Bradley Byrne, Republican of Alabama, will sponsor the legislation in the House, and said it answered President Trump\u2019s call in his State of the Union address to \u201cpass school choice for America\u2019s children.\u201d \u201cThis is the way Washington should get involved in education matters,\u201d he said. Congressional Democrats swiftly rejected the legislation as a nonstarter. Representative Robert C. Scott, a Virginia Democrat who is chairman of the House Education Committee, said Democrats were spending their energy on issues like reversing what he called the chronic underfunding of public schools. \u201cHouse Democrats will not waste time on proposals that undermine public education,\u201d he said. In a statement, Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the senior Democrat on the Senate Education Committee, called the proposal \u201cdead on arrival.\u201d \u201cSecretary DeVos keeps pushing her anti-public school agenda despite a clear lack of support from parents, students, teachers and even within her own party,\u201d Ms. Murray said. \u201cCongress has repeatedly rejected her privatization efforts, and she should expect nothing less here.\u201d On hand at the announcement Thursday were students who flourished in schools they attended with vouchers or tax credit scholarships. \u201cWhile education freedom changed my life, there are many, including some of my friends and family members, who are continually denied that right,\u201d said Walter Banks, who participated in the Ohio scholarship program and is now enrolled in college. \u201cI still go and visit some of the people that I grew up with, in prison, and we talk about some of the things we used to do, but because of a proper education I was able to escape that fate.\u201d Sam Myers, who has Down syndrome and also graduated from a private school thorough Ohio\u2019s program, said, \u201cSchool choice helped my dreams come true.\u201d \u201cI have a job, I do things with my friends and family because of the skills I learned,\u201d Mr. Myers said. Mr. Cruz said he anticipated a political fight. He said he hoped to tap Democratic constituencies like blue-collar unions that are invested in issues like work force development with an additional $5 billion in the bill that would fund similar scholarships for adult programs. He also promoted a last-minute amendment he proposed to the federal tax law passed by Congress in 2017 that expanded 529 college savings plans to cover expenses for private primary and secondary education. The amendment required a late-night, tiebreaking vote from Vice President Mike Pence. Carl Davis, the research director for the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, noted that the new tax credit would be extremely generous in providing a 100 percent tax break, especially because the new tax law eliminated some incentives for charitable giving. \u201cNow they want to put a supersized one back into the code,\u201d he said, \u201cbut only if you donate to the cause they\u2019ve cherry-picked for you: private K-12 schools.\u201d",

      "author": "Erica L. Green",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Victims\u2019 rights and women\u2019s rights groups sued Education Secretary Betsy DeVos on Thursday, saying that rules that she issued last year to guide campuses on how to manage sexual assault complaints violated federal law and discriminated against accusers. Three organizations, represented by prominent civil rights litigators, filed a complaint in the Northern District of California outlining ways that the guidance issued by Ms. DeVos in the fall had had a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on campus sexual assault investigations. Since the guidance was issued, the groups charged, accusers have been less inclined to pursue sexual assault cases, and colleges have demonstrated a lack of urgency and clarity in pursuing them. In September, Ms. DeVos rescinded Obama-era guidance on how colleges should manage the investigations under Title IX, the federal law that prohibits sex discrimination and governs the rules on investigating sexual assault on campus. A spokeswoman for the department declined to comment, citing pending litigation. Under Ms. DeVos\u2019s administration, the department has continued to open sexual assault cases and has maintained a contentious Obama-era practice of publishing a list of campuses with open investigations. Last week, in an abrupt and unannounced move, the department began publishing a database of all pending civil rights cases. According to the database, which is to be updated monthly, the department is investigating 773 sexual harassment cases and 480 sexual violence cases. The Obama-era guidance, issued in 2011 and 2014, reinforced the obligation of colleges and universities to respond to sexual assault claims and was widely hailed as strengthening protections for accusers amid increasing evidence that those institutions were skirting their responsibilities to investigate sexual misconduct. But it was widely assailed by men\u2019s rights and conservative civil liberties groups as heavily biased against the accused. In an extensive policy speech announcing the new guidance, Ms. DeVos outlined what she described as a \u201cfailed system\u201d that violated students\u2019 due process rights and lacked public confidence. \u201cSchools must continue to confront these horrific crimes and behaviors head-on,\u201d Ms. DeVos said in September. \u201cBut the process must also be fair and impartial, giving everyone more confidence in its outcomes.\u201d Ms. DeVos issued interim guidance that raised the standard of proof for accusers to \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d from a \u201cpreponderance of evidence\u201d and allowed cases to be settled in mediation sessions between the accuser and the accused. It also dropped time frames for completing investigations. \u201cThe new policy discriminates against women and girls and makes it harder for them to learn in a safe environment,\u201d said Fatima Goss Graves, the president of the National Women\u2019s Law Center, which is representing the litigants in the suit. The plaintiffs in the suit, Equal Rights Advocates, SurvJustice and the Victim Rights Law Center, all advise or represent people who say they were sexually assaulted. The groups are being represented by Equal Rights Advocates, Democracy Forward Foundation, the National Center for Youth Law and the National Women\u2019s Law Center. In the complaint, SurvJustice said that the group had not only seen \u201ca decrease in the number of sexual violence survivors seeking its services,\u201d but also observed a trend in educational institutions not responding at all, or not responding as promptly to its clients\u2019 complaints. The group also wrote of \u201cstudents who have questioned whether they should continue with their plans to report sexual violence given the uncertainty regarding their legal protections and an anticipated lowered likelihood of success created by the policy change.\u201d The Victims Rights Law Center, which focuses its efforts on rape and sexual assault, said Ms. DeVos\u2019s guidance was \u201cdevastating\u201d to its mission and operational activities. The groups are asking that the guidance be rescinded as unlawful. \u201cWith each day that passes, this discriminatory policy will continue to cause harm to survivors of sexual harassment and violence,\u201d said Alice Y. Abrokwa, a lawyer at the National Center for Youth Law. In their complaint, the groups wrote that Ms. DeVos and her acting leader of civil rights, Candice Jackson, made statements that revealed their bias against accusers. They cited Ms. DeVos\u2019s policy address during which she asserted that \u201cif everything is harassment, then nothing is,\u201d and Ms. Jackson\u2019s dismissal of women who accused President Trump of sexual harassment as \u201cfake victims.\u201d",

GreenPRINT EDITIONDeVos Weighs Funding Guns For Educators|August 24, 2018, Page A1",
      "author": "Erica L. Green",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 When Congress created its academic support fund three years ago, lawmakers had in mind a pot of money that would increase student access to art and music, mental health and technology programs at the nation\u2019s most impoverished schools. But back-to-back school shootings this year and inquiries from the state of Texas have prompted the education secretary, Betsy DeVos, to examine whether to allow states to tap the school enrichment fund for another purpose: guns. Such a move would reverse a longstanding position taken by the federal government that it should not pay to outfit schools with weaponry. It would also undermine efforts by Congress to restrict the use of federal funding on guns. As recently as March, Congress passed a school safety bill that allocated $50 million a year to local school districts, but expressly prohibited the use of the money for firearms. But the Every Student Succeeds Act, signed into law in 2015, is silent on weapons purchases, and that omission would allow Ms. DeVos to use her discretion to approve or deny any state or district plans to use the enrichment grants under the measure for firearms and firearm training, unless Congress clarifies the law or bans such funding through legislative action. \u201cThe department is constantly considering and evaluating policy issues, particularly issues related to school safety,\u201d said Liz Hill, a spokeswoman for the Education Department. The $1 billion student support program, known as the Student Support and Academic Enrichment grants, is intended for the country\u2019s poorest schools and calls for school districts to use the money toward three goals: providing a well-rounded education, improving school conditions for learning and improving the use of technology for digital literacy. Senator Chris Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, introduced legislation on Thursday to block the Education Department from allowing school districts to use federal funds to purchase firearms. The ranking Democrat on the House education committee, Representative Robert C. Scott of Virginia, said granting state requests to use federal funds for firearms would be \u201copenly violating the spirit of the law as well as common sense about gun safety.\u201d \u201cRedirecting that money to arm teachers and school staff will recklessly endanger the safety of both students and educators, while robbing underserved students of the support and opportunity they deserve,\u201d Mr. Scott said. But it was unclear whether or when a legislative response would receive a vote. The Republicans who created the fund were hesitant to curb the flexibility that it offers local governments. \u201cI\u2019m not a fan of arming teachers, but the safe schools block grant for many years has allowed states to make the decision about how to use those federal dollars to make schools safer for children,\u201d said Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, who was one of the chief architects of the new education law. A spokeswoman for the House education committee said the chairwoman for the panel, Representative Virginia Foxx of North Carolina, believed the grants \u201cwere intentionally designed to give states and local school districts the ability to determine and implement policies to serve their communities.\u201d Department officials acknowledged that carrying out the proposal would be the first time that a federal agency has authorized the purchase of weapons without a congressional mandate, according to people familiar with the discussions. And while no such restrictions exist in the federal education law, it could undermine the grant program\u2019s adoption of \u201cdrug and violence prevention,\u201d which defines a safe school environment as free of weapons. In its research, the Education Department has determined that the gun purchases could fall under improving school conditions, people familiar with the department\u2019s thinking said. Under the current guidelines for that part of the grant, the department encourages schools to increase access to mental health counseling, establish dropout prevention programs, reduce suspensions and expulsions and improve re-entry programs for students transitioning from the juvenile justice system. Department officials confirmed Thursday that they began exploring the possibility after Texas inquired about whether it could use funding for its firearms program. Texas, known for its \u201cschool marshal\u201d program, is one of at least nine states that allow school employees to be armed or have access to firearms on campuses. A spokeswoman for the Texas Education Agency, said that the agency did not formally request that it be able to use the money for firearms, but that it \u201csimply sought clarification\u201d on whether it was allowable. In May, Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas sent a letter to Ms. DeVos asking for additional funding, and stated his intent to use the state\u2019s $62 million increase in support grants under the education law for school safety measures. The letter, reviewed by The New York Times, did not specify guns. Department officials were considering whether to issue guidance on the funding allowances before the start of the new school year, but have been weighing the political and legal ramifications of gun purchases, according to people familiar with the discussions. While Ms. DeVos\u2019s policy approach tends to favor flexibility and decision-making at a local level, the department believes that Congress should address the vagueness in the law, according to people with knowledge of the department\u2019s thinking. Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, who helped write the education law, said the intent of Congress was clear. \u201cWhen Republicans and Democrats came together to pass the bipartisan Every Student Succeeds Act, we were clear that these grants were intended to help foster safe, healthy and supportive environments that improve student learning \u2014 not prop up the N.R.A. and gun sales,\u201d Ms. Murray, the top Democrat on the Senate education committee, said in a statement. After the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., the Trump administration convened a federal commission on school safety, led by Ms. DeVos, to examine topics like mental and behavioral health resources, building security and the role of law enforcement in schools. Ms. DeVos said the commission would not study the role of guns in school shootings, except for a few narrow exceptions, like age restrictions. The commission has held several public hearings where educators and advocates from across the country have asked for expanded support staff and services, including school counselors, and additional security measures. Members of the commission have also visited school districts, such as one in rural Arkansas, where armed employees can be found at schools in areas not easily reached by law enforcement. The commission plans to issue recommendations by the end of the year. The Trump administration\u2019s call to arm educators has faced overwhelming criticism from educators, lawmakers and law enforcement officials. That opposition only hardened on Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s one more example of the corruption, greed and misplaced values of this administration,\u201d said Lily Eskelsen Garc\u00eda, the president of the National Education Association, the largest teacher\u2019s union in the country. \u201cIf we use the funds for what they were intended to be used for, we might start tackling some of the issues that lead to gun violence.\u201d The measure would also break from decades-old practice in how funding is doled out for the purposes of school security. Guidance for grants distributed by the Homeland Security Department that are intended for \u201cschool preparedness,\u201d for example, notes that weapons and ammunition are not permitted. After the Parkland shooting, Congress added a rule prohibiting the use of grants for firearms or firearm training in the Stop School Violence Act, under which the Justice Department grants funds to school districts. The Trump administration has twice moved to eliminate the grant program from its budget. But as Congress drafted a spending bill in the months after the Parkland shooting, advocates pointed to the program as emblematic of a successful approach to school safety. Congress instead increased funding for the grants by $700 million in the bill passed this year. A group of more than 20 advocacy organizations has advocated for two years to preserve funding for the school support grants. The group, called the Title IV-A Coalition, said in a statement that it had been virtually ignored by the Education Department. \u201cOnly now, after Congress significantly increased funding, has the department taken notice and is attempting to capitalize on an opportunity to push their baseless agenda to arm teachers, which the majority of the country has spoken out against,\u201d said the group, which includes the National Association of School Psychologists, the National Association of Secondary School Principals and the National PTA.",

      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 After a two-day thrashing over her department\u2019s proposal to eliminate funding for the Special Olympics, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos sat before senators on Thursday ready to defend it again. \u201cAs I said then, and I\u2019ll say again, we had to make tough choices and decisions around the budget priorities,\u201d Ms. DeVos told Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the Senate\u2019s No. 2 Democrat. She even went on to tell him in a fiery exchange to \u201cnot use disabled children in a twisted way for your political narrative.\u201d But when President Trump triumphantly declared Thursday evening that he had \u201coverridden my people\u201d and saved the Special Olympics, Ms. DeVos seemed to have taken enough blame. \u201cI am pleased and grateful the president and I see eye-to-eye on this issue, and that he has decided to fund our Special Olympics grant,\u201d Ms. DeVos said. \u201cThis is funding I have fought for behind-the-scenes over the last several years.\u201d It was an unusual move for Ms. DeVos, who has gone to great lengths to publicly support the president even when she and her staff have disagreed with the administration\u2019s policy positions. And it has kicked off fresh speculation that Ms. DeVos might be the next member of the cabinet to fall to the commander in chief\u2019s capricious whims. The White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, insisted that there is no tension between the two. \u201cPresident Donald J. Trump considers Secretary DeVos a personal friend and appreciates and respects the incredible job she is doing for students across the country, at an agency that was once so badly mismanaged under the Obama administration,\u201d she said. But for months, Mr. Trump has mocked Ms. DeVos to other aides, making clear that he considers her expendable, according to West Wing officials. When Ms. DeVos was out of office after an injury many weeks ago, White House officials expected that her absence would be used as an opportunity to replace her. That didn\u2019t happen. But Mr. Trump is not fond of her, White House officials said, and he had no problem making her appear to be the bad actor in relation to the Special Olympics. A White House official denied the characterization. Others have said that the president does not have a dislike of Ms. DeVos as much as he has apathy toward her and her entire department, and does not generally consider her \u2014 or it \u2014 worth expending much energy on. Even Representative Mark Pocan, Democrat of Wisconsin, whose questions about the program cuts on Tuesday caused the media firestorm over the Special Olympics, was surprised by the turn of events. \u201cI\u2019m extremely glad that the American people have convinced President Trump to do the right thing with Special Olympics,\u201d Mr. Pocan said. \u201cHowever, it shouldn\u2019t take public outcry and shaming to restore funding to one of our nation\u2019s most important special education programs.\u201d \u201cAnd by the way, can someone pull Betsy from under the bus?\u201d he added. Those with knowledge of Ms. DeVos\u2019s relationship with the White House say she and the president have a positive working relationship, communicate regularly \u2014 and that he has generally seen her as a team player and one of the most effective at hard-charging his policy priorities. He has complimented her publicly, and once, even stopped a meeting to have a group of stakeholders go around the room and praise her efforts to rewrite campus sexual assault rules, according to an official with knowledge of the meeting. \u201cI think the president chose her because he realizes that she is committed to taking the arrows and pursuing the agenda that\u2019s 100 percent committed to students,\u201d said Matt Frendewey, who served as Ms. DeVos\u2019s communications director at the outset of her tenure. When the Trump administration moved to scrap protections for transgender students to use the bathroom of their choice, Ms. DeVos raised strong objections with the president, but in the end, she went along with the plan spearheaded by Jeff Sessions, the attorney general at the time. And when she was appointed head of a federal school safety commission after the school massacre in Parkland, Fla., Ms. DeVos was charged by Mr. Sessions and the White House with scrutinizing a seemingly unrelated policy on racial disparities in school discipline. Her staff urged her to push back, according to officials familiar with the decision. But she soldiered on. She even issued a statement praising Mr. Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the Paris Agreement on climate change, though it had nothing to do with education. But the president\u2019s proclamation on Thursday evening left her taking the fall for a proposed funding cut to a program for people with special needs that she had personally supported in the past. Her tart reaction was a rare public display of pique after she once again had been served up as a punching bag for the administration. Of course, Congress, which actually makes the spending decisions, has no intention of cutting the Special Olympics grants \u2014 which his budget has proposed for the past two years \u2014 so Mr. Trump restored nothing. Three days before the cut was revealed in his budget request for the fiscal year that begins this October,  the White House had announced with fanfare that Karen Pence, the second lady of the United States, would lead the American delegation to the games. For that matter, nor did Mr. Trump fully fund an ongoing cleanup of the Great Lakes that he took credit for in Grand Rapids, Mich., on Thursday night. His budget has annually proposed to slash the Great Lakes restoration program, and Congress has annually ignored him. According to people familiar with the budget process, the proposal to eliminate funding for the Special Olympics was pushed through by the acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, and his staff in the Office of Management and Budget, which has the power to change and reject budget requests and does so regularly for all government agencies. Mr. Mulvaney, who helped found the hard-line Freedom Caucus in the House, has brought those sensibilities to the White House, not always with Mr. Trump\u2019s knowledge or support. Mr. Durbin acknowledged that fact, saying that \u201cwhoever came up with the idea at O.M.B. deserved a Special Olympic gold medal for insensitivity.\u201d It was among more than two dozen programs that the office has consistently identified for elimination or reduction because they were deemed ineffective or inappropriate for federal funding. Among other programs targeted is $1 billion in after-school programs that serve low-income children, funding for arts education and a program serving gifted students. The position of the administration has been that the Special Olympics is not a federal program, but a private one that has been able to raise $100 million annually and should be supported by the philanthropic community. \u201cThere are dozens of worthy nonprofits that support students and adults with disabilities that don\u2019t get a dime of federal grant money,\u201d Ms. DeVos said in a statement defending the cut earlier this week. \u201cBut given our current budget realities, the federal government cannot fund every worthy program, particularly ones that enjoy robust support from private donations.\u201d Privately, Ms. DeVos argued since the administration\u2019s first budget proposal in 2017 that the cut was insensitive and unnecessary. The program fell into a category of ones that budget office staff targeted for cuts because its benefits could not be measured. Ms. DeVos argued the measurement for the Special Olympics, and other programs, should be how it affects children. She was overruled. In 2018, Ms. DeVos, a billionaire businesswoman, decided to donate a portion of her annual salary to the program.",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 For years, Betsy DeVos traveled the country \u2014 and opened her checkbook \u2014 as she worked as a conservative advocate to promote the expansion of voucher programs that allow parents to use taxpayer funds to send their children to private and religious schools. A detailed look at the first six months of Ms. DeVos\u2019s tenure as the secretary of education \u2014 based on a 326-page calendar tracking her daily meetings \u2014 demonstrates that she continues to focus on those programs as well as on charter schools. Her calendar is sprinkled with meetings with religious leaders, leading national advocates of vouchers and charter schools, and players involved in challenging state laws that limit the distribution of government funds to support religious or alternative schools. On June 13, for example, she started her day by speaking to about 4,000 people who had gathered in Washington for the National Charter Schools Conference, the records show. Later that morning, she met with Jeanne and Rex Sinquefield, multimillionaires from Missouri and major donors to the Show Me Institute, a nonprofit group that promotes school vouchers. The meeting was to discuss litigation then pending before the Supreme Court that examined issues related to government grants to educational programs sponsored by religious entities. Then, that same day, there was a meeting with the South Carolina African American Chamber of Commerce, according to Ms. DeVos\u2019s calendar, to discuss \u201cher agenda for school choice and how we engage more African-American communities in that work to include charter schools.\u201d The appointment books also include discussions related to traditional public schools, such as a telephone call in February with Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, which represents 1.7 million public schoolteachers and other employees nationwide. Ms. DeVos then had a follow-up visit in April with Ms. Weingarten to a public school in Ohio. But the emphasis, a review of the calendar shows, is on the same kinds of alternatives that Ms. DeVos promoted when she was a conservative philanthropist donating money to groups like Alliance for School Choice and the Foundation for Excellence in Education, which advocate school choice. Nathan Bailey, a spokesman for Ms. DeVos, said she had met with a variety of players from the world of education, including state education chiefs, superintendents, principals and teachers. He also said that Ms. DeVos has visited more public schools since she started than religious or private schools. \u201cSecretary DeVos is focused on ensuring all students have equal access to a great education,\u201d he said in a written statement, adding, \u201cShe has made no secret that giving parents more options is a critical way to help improve outcomes, and America\u2019s families have been clear in their demands for more and better choices.\u201d The detailed calendar entries suggest Ms. DeVos remains closely involved with some of the people helping to lead or advise leaders in the school choice movement. Among them are Frank Luntz, the Republican pollster, whom Ms. DeVos was scheduled to meet on June 21 to discuss language she could use to promote school vouchers without generating as much resistance to the effort, according to the notes in her agenda. \u201cFrank has a 60 slide deck of the words to use and the words to lose regarding parental choice, vouchers, charter schools, teacher pay and all the other issues in education reform,\u201d the notes say. On July 10, Ms. DeVos met with a Republican state senator from Tennessee, Brian Kelsey, according to her calendar, to discuss the \u201cfederal government\u2019s plans for school vouchers.\u201d In her first weeks on the job, she also had a call with former Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas. The topic was listed as \u201cSchool Choice in Texas.\u201d According to the calendar, Ms. DeVos also met with Tim Keller and Richard Komer of the Institute for Justice, a conservative nonprofit that has joined lawsuits in Montana, Nevada and additional states to defend the ability of parents to use taxpayer-funded vouchers to cover tuition for their children to attend private religious schools. The goal of the meeting: \u201csuggest a few areas where the Department could facilitate school choice efforts and offer the Sec. help in those areas.\u201d Mr. Komer said he had known Ms. DeVos for a decade and was glad to see her maintain her commitment to school choice. \u201cWe would like to see them promote parent choice and parent power to choose,\u201d Mr. Komer said of the 30-minute meeting he had with Ms. DeVos. Her schedule also shows various appointments with representatives from the Association of Catholic Colleges and Universities, the American Association of Christian Schools and the Christian Academy for Reaching Excellence; with the education chairman from the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops; and with officials from other religious groups. Ms. Weingarten, the school union president, said in an interview on Thursday that Ms. DeVos\u2019s calendar was a case study in her priorities. \u201cShe has very much undermined public schooling, which 90 percent of children in America attend and which is the foundation to America\u2019s democracy,\u201d Ms. Weingarten said. The daily log of Ms. DeVos\u2019s activity since February, when she was confirmed by the Senate, also shows extensive travel. Ms. DeVos has said she pays for the trips herself since she typically goes on a privately owned plane. Liz Hill, a spokeswoman for the Education Department, said that Ms. DeVos \u201ctravels on personally owned aircraft, accompanied by her security detail and whenever possible, additional support staff\u201d without charging the government. In addition, Ms. Hill said, Ms. DeVos also does not accept reimbursement for lodging or other travel-related costs. An examination of Ms. DeVos\u2019s calendar shows that she frequently leaves Washington on what appear to be long weekends, as her work calendar indicates no appointments on certain Fridays or Mondays surrounding these trips to destinations that have included Vero Beach, Fla., Aspen, Colo., and Grand Rapids, Mich. All are places where Ms. DeVos or a member of her family owns a home. The records show that Ms. DeVos took long weekends on at least 11 occasions, meaning that her work calendar indicates no appointments on at least one workday around the weekend. On Friday, March 3, for example, the records show that Ms. DeVos went to Aspen \u2014 where her family owns a ski-in, ski-out home in Snowmass Village \u2014 and that she did not return to the office, or have any work appointments, until Tuesday, March 7. She then left on March 8, for Sea Island, Ga., where she attended an American Enterprise Institute World Forum, with her calendar showing that she did not return to the office for work appointments until Monday, March 13. On Thursday, March 30, Ms. DeVos\u2019s calendar shows that she left her office at 3 p.m. for Ronald Reagan National Airport near Washington on her way to Vero Beach, where she and her husband, Dick DeVos, have a home. Austin Evers, a State Department lawyer during the Obama administration who now serves as the executive director of a liberal nonprofit group, American Oversight, which sued the Education Department for the records and provided a copy of them to The New York Times, said Ms. DeVos\u2019s frequent days out of the office with no appointments on her calendar amounted to \u201ctruancy.\u201d Nathan Bailey, a spokesman for Ms. DeVos, called the analysis of Ms. DeVos\u2019s days away from Washington with no appointments \u201cfatally flawed.\u201d The entries, he said, only reflect formal appointments. Ms. DeVos is routinely working, he said, even if nothing is listed on her work calendar. \u201cSecretary DeVos isn\u2019t a creature of Washington and prefers to spend her time in communities across the country with America\u2019s students, parents and educators,\u201d Mr. Bailey said in a statement. \u201cShe travels often to make that possible, and she travels at no expense to taxpayers.\u201d",

      "author": "Kate Zernike",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Until Tuesday, the fight over Betsy DeVos\u2019s nomination to be secretary of education revolved mostly around her support of contentious school choice programs. But her confirmation hearing that night opened her up to new criticism: that her long battle for school choice, controversial as it has been, is the sum total of her experience and understanding of education policy. In questioning by senators, she seemed either unaware or unsupportive of the longstanding policies and functions of the department she is in line to lead, from special education rules to the policing of for-profit universities. Ms. DeVos admitted that she might have been \u201cconfused\u201d when she appeared not to know that the broad statute that has governed special education for more than four decades is federal law. A billionaire investor, education philanthropist and Michigan Republican activist, Ms. DeVos acknowledged that she has no personal experience with student loans \u2014 the federal government is the largest provider \u2014 and said she would have to \u201creview\u201d the department\u2019s policies that try to prevent fraud by for-profit colleges. She appeared blank on basic education terms. Asked how school performance should be assessed, she did not know the difference between growth, which measures how much students have learned over a given period, and proficiency, which measures how many students reach a targeted score. Ms. DeVos even became something of an internet punch line when she suggested that some school officials should be allowed to carry guns on the premises to defend against grizzly bears. But if she was sometimes rattled on the specifics, Ms. DeVos was unshakable in her belief that education authority should devolve away from the federal government and toward state and local authorities. Whether the issue was allowing guns in schools, how to investigate sexual assault on college campuses, or how to measure learning, her answer was always that states and what she called \u201clocales\u201d knew best. Those answers reflected the same instinct that has driven her advocacy of school choice, primarily vouchers, which take money from public schools to help families pay tuition at private schools, and charter schools, which are publicly funded but typically independent of school district or union rules. As she said bluntly in a 2015 education speech, \u201cGovernment really sucks.\u201d Ms. DeVos\u2019s supporters defended her performance at the hearing, saying she showed herself to be a champion of innovation against Democrats\u2019 defending the status quo. \u201cThey tried their best to turn her into Cruella de Vil, but America got to see the real Betsy DeVos first hand,\u201d said Ed Patru, a spokesman for a group calling itself Friends of Betsy DeVos. \u201cThe country saw an authentic, compassionate and eminently reasonable education leader who is committed to empowering parents and putting kids first.\u201d With a Republican-controlled Senate, Ms. DeVos is still likely to be confirmed. But her statements on special education could make her vulnerable; families of children with special needs are a vocal lobby, one that Republicans do not want to alienate. The federal Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, or IDEA, has governed special education in the nation\u2019s public schools since the mid-1970s. Before the law, states and local school districts had been excluding or essentially warehousing students with disabilities. Complaints from states and local school districts have been less about the law than about the federal government\u2019s failure to pay its promised share of the costs. But at the hearing, Ms. DeVos questioned the basic premise that the federal government has a role in ensuring that any school receiving taxpayer dollars \u2014 whether a traditional public school, a charter or a private school accepting vouchers \u2014 comply with the law\u2019s requirements for students with special needs. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, last year\u2019s Democratic nominee for vice president, asked Ms. DeVos whether schools that receive tax dollars should be required to meet the requirements of IDEA. \u201cI think that is a matter that\u2019s best left to the states,\u201d Ms. DeVos replied. Mr. Kaine came back: \u201cSo some states might be good to kids with disabilities, and other states might not be so good, and then what? People can just move around the country if they don\u2019t like how their kids are being treated?\u201d Ms. DeVos repeated, \u201cI think that is an issue that\u2019s best left to the states.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s federal law,\u201d an exasperated Mr. Kaine replied. Mr. Kaine then asked if all elementary and secondary schools receiving tax dollars should be required to comply with reporting requirements on harassment, discipline and bullying. Ms. DeVos answered, \u201cI would look forward to reviewing that provision.\u201d Senator Maggie Hassan, Democrat of New Hampshire, pressed Ms. DeVos about whether she really intended to say that states could ignore the law. \u201cWere you unaware that it was federal law?\u201d Ms. Hassan asked. Ms. DeVos answered, \u201cI may have confused it.\u201d Ms. Hassan, who has a son with cerebral palsy, expressed concerns about private schools that accept vouchers on the condition that students waive legal rights under federal education law. \u201cDo you think families should have recourse in the courts if schools don\u2019t meet their needs?\u201d she asked. \u201cSenator, I assure you that if confirmed I will be very sensitive to the needs of special needs students,\u201d Ms. DeVos said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about sensitivity, although that helps,\u201d Ms. Hassan countered. \u201cIt\u2019s about being willing to enforce the law to make sure that my child and every child has the same access to public education, high-quality public education.\u201d In her opening statement, Ms. DeVos spoke of wanting to expand options for higher education beyond traditional \u201cbrick and mortar and ivy.\u201d Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, asked Ms. DeVos whether she would enforce Obama-era education policies intended to prevent fraud at for-profit colleges \u2014 institutions like Trump University, which paid to settle federal class action lawsuits accusing it of using marketing tactics to enroll students. \u201cI will review that rule and see that it is actually achieving what the intentions are,\u201d Ms. DeVos said. Ms. Warren, in apparent disbelief, responded: \u201cSwindlers and crooks are out there doing back flips when they hear an answer like this.\u201d She added, \u201cIf confirmed, you will be the cop on the beat, and if you can\u2019t commit to use the tools already available to you in the Department of Education, then I don\u2019t see how you can be the secretary of education.\u201d",

      "author": "Erica L. Green",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Education Secretary Betsy DeVos disregarded a scathing review by her own staff this spring when she reinstated the watchdog body that had accredited two scandal-scarred for-profit universities whose bankruptcies left tens of thousands of students with worthless degrees and mountains of debt, a new report has revealed. A 244-page internal document, written by career staff and delivered to the secretary in early March but made public late Friday, found that the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools, or Acics, had failed to meet 57 of 93 federal quality and management compliance standards as it vied to continue operating as a gatekeeper for billions in federal financial aid dollars. The findings were released late last week after the department was sued by the National Student Legal Defense Network and the Century Foundation. Education Department officials said that despite the March report, Ms. DeVos was obligated to reinstate Acics as an accrediting body for colleges and universities because of a federal court order that had faulted the process the Obama-era department had used to terminate its recognition. A federal judge sent the decision back to Ms. DeVos for reconsideration. \u201cThe secretary did not make the determination to reinstate Acics,\u201d Liz Hill, a department spokeswoman, said in a statement. \u201cThis department can\u2019t operate on or enforce a decision that was found invalid by the court.\u201d But higher-education groups said that Ms. DeVos went above and beyond the court\u2019s order in restoring the organization\u2019s status while she considered the new information. \u201cIt\u2019s no wonder that Acics and Secretary DeVos didn\u2019t want this report to come out,\u201d said Alex Elson, a senior counsel at the National Student Legal Defense Network. \u201cClearly, she was well aware that Acics was getting worse, not better, and has been working to help them anyway.\u201d Acics was stripped of its powers in December 2016 amid the collapse of two for-profit university chains, Corinthian Colleges and ITT Tech, where students were encouraged to take on debt based on false promises, including jobs after graduation. The accrediting body was held responsible for allowing the schools to employ predatory recruitment practices. The scandal rocked the for-profit college industry, which became a target of the Obama administration. And taxpayers are still covering the fallout as the DeVos Education Department manages more than 100,000 applications for debt relief totaling hundreds of millions of dollars. On Monday, a judge in San Francisco was set to hear arguments that the department should grant full loan relief to Corinthian students. On Wednesday, an Indianapolis court is set to approve a $1.5 billion settlement for aggrieved ITT students. Acics applied in September to be recognized as a new agency, seeking a new start under DeVos\u2019s leadership and saying that it had demonstrated improvements in its management. When the Obama administration revoked Acics\u2019s accrediting powers, the Education Department found that it had racked up nearly two dozen violations. Far from improving, the March report said that the number of violations had nearly tripled. In April, Ms. DeVos temporarily restored recognition of Acics anyway, after a judge found the Obama administration had violated procedural rules by failing to consider more than 30,000 pages of information submitted by the council before the department revoked its recognition as an accrediting body. That temporary restoration expires July 30, but Ms. Hill said Ms. DeVos would not consider the draft report as she deliberates Acics\u2019s fate because the report was \u201crendered moot by the court\u2019s order.\u201d Advocates say that Ms. DeVos is using the court order as a convenient excuse. They note that the judge did not vacate the 2016 decision, and that Ms. DeVos was not compelled to reinstate Acics. The report provides the most up-to-date evaluation of the organization, which still oversees dozens of colleges. In March, Acics was accused by the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, of accrediting \u201cvisa mills,\u201d used by foreign students to come to the United States with minimal scrutiny. \u201cThis report makes clear that Acics is a wholly unfit and unreliable evaluator of higher-education institutions,\u201d said Robert Shireman, a senior fellow at the Century Foundation and a former Obama Education Department official. \u201cBetsy DeVos may be content with ignoring the overwhelming outside consensus on Acics\u2019s performance, but she cannot deny the expert opinions of her own staff.\u201d Among the report\u2019s findings was that the accrediting body had failed to provide information showing that it had resolved conflicts of interest and had failed to demonstrate that it had processes in place for evaluating its institutions\u2019 compliance with federal financial aid laws. Additionally, Education Department staff wrote that Acics did not provide documentation showing that it had ensured that measurements of student achievement rates were rigorous, or that it had a consistent standard for determining when to alert the Education Department to fraud and abuse. In releasing the report, department officials wrote that the analysis was an \u201cincomplete, predecisional document,\u201d and that \u201cit is typical for a draft staff analysis to include findings or deficiencies that are easily resolved by the agency.\u201d Michelle Edwards, the president of Acics, said in a statement that the agency fought the release of the report because \u201cit would represent a dangerous aberration from historical practice \u2014 one that jeopardizes the frank and constructive exchange of information between the department and all accreditors.\u201d But she said the organization has had the opportunity to respond to \u201cnumerous inaccuracies\u201d and to provide more information to the department documenting its compliance. \u201cWe stand by the information we have presented to the department, and we look forward to completing the review process in an efficient and constructive manner,\u201d Ms. Edwards said.",

      "author": "Kate Zernike",
      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 At her confirmation hearing on Tuesday to be education secretary, Betsy DeVos vigorously defended her work steering taxpayer dollars from traditional public schools, arguing that it was time to move away from a \u201cone size fits all\u201d system and toward newer models for students from preschool to college. The hearing quickly became a heated and partisan debate that reflected the nation\u2019s political divide on how best to spend public money in education. Republicans applauded Ms. DeVos\u2019s work to expand charter schools and school vouchers, which give families public funds to help pay tuition at private schools. Democrats criticized her for wanting to \u201cprivatize\u201d public education and pushed her, unsuccessfully, to support making public colleges and universities tuition-free. Ms. DeVos, a billionaire with a complex web of investments, including in companies that stand to win or lose from federal education policy, was the first nominee of President-elect Donald J. Trump to have a Senate hearing without completing an ethics review on how she planned to avoid conflicts of interest. Democrats pointed out that in the past, Republicans had insisted that no hearings be conducted before those reviews were complete. Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee and chairman of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, limited the questioning to one round of five minutes for each senator, prompting howls from Democrats, who noted that previous hearings had included two rounds of questions. \u201cIt suggests that this committee is trying to protect this nominee from scrutiny,\u201d said Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut. With time limited, Democrats confronted Ms. DeVos with rapid-fire questions, demanding that she explain her family\u2019s contributions to groups that support so-called conversion therapy for gay people; her donations to Republicans and their causes, which she agreed totaled about $200 million over the years; her past statements that government \u201csucks\u201d and that public schools are a \u201cdead end\u201d; and the poor performance of charter schools in Detroit, where she resisted legislation that would have blocked chronically failing charter schools from expanding. Under questioning, Ms. DeVos said it would be \u201cpremature\u201d to say whether she would continue the Obama administration\u2019s policy requiring uniform reporting standards for sexual assaults on college campuses. She told Mr. Murphy, whose constituents include families whose children were killed in the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, that it should be \u201cleft to locales\u201d to decide whether guns are allowed in schools, and that she supported Mr. Trump\u2019s call to ban gun-free zones around schools. She also denied that she had personally supported conversion therapy. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts pressed Ms. DeVos on how she could oversee the Education Department, the largest provider of student loans, given that she had no experience running a large bureaucracy and that neither she nor her children had ever taken out a student loan. \u201cSo you have no personal experience with college financial aid?\u201d Ms. Warren asked. Ms. DeVos, who did not attend public schools or send her children to public schools, argued that vouchers and charter schools were simply a way of offering poor parents the kind of school choice that wealthy parents have long been able to afford. She described a visit she and her husband, an heir to the Amway fortune, made to a Christian school in her hometown, Grand Rapids, Mich., as a turning point in her career as a school choice advocate. \u201cWe saw the struggles and sacrifices many of these families faced when trying to choose the best educational option for their children,\u201d she said. \u201cFor me, this was not just an issue of public policy but of national injustice.\u201d But Democrats said research showed that voucher programs had done little to raise achievement among poor students. Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the ranking Democrat on the committee, asked Ms. DeVos, \u201cCan you commit to us that you will not work to privatize public schools or cut a single penny from public education?\u201d Ms. DeVos began to demur, saying that \u201cnot all schools are working for the students that are assigned to them\u201d and that she would work to find \u201ccommon ground\u201d to give parents \u201coptions.\u201d \u201cI take that as not being willing to commit to not privatizing public education,\u201d Ms. Murray said. Mr. Alexander, himself a former education secretary, argued that Ms. DeVos\u2019s support of charter schools and vouchers put her in the \u201cmainstream\u201d of public opinion, and that her critics were outside it. He noted that charter schools, which are publicly funded but typically run independently of local school districts and teachers\u2019 unions, have been supported by Republican and Democratic presidents going back to Bill Clinton. Democrats, however, argued that Ms. DeVos\u2019s support went well beyond charter schools, to include the more contentious policy of sending public money to private and religious schools. \u201cCharter schools are not the issue here,\u201d said Senator Al Franken of Minnesota, where Democrats pushed the nation\u2019s first law allowing charter schools nearly three decades ago. He noted that 37 states prohibit the use of public dollars for religious schools. One Republican, Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, expressed concern about Ms. DeVos\u2019s enthusiasm for school choice \u2014 a moot point for many of her constituents, given the vastness of her state. \u201cWhen there is no way to get to an alternative option for your child, the best parent is left relying on a public school system that they demand to be there for their kids,\u201d she said, asking Ms. DeVos to ensure that her commitment to traditional public education was as \u201cstrong and robust\u201d as her passion for school choice.",

      "author": "Emmarie Huetteman",
      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 Betsy DeVos, a wealthy Republican donor with almost no experience in public education, was confirmed by the Senate as the nation\u2019s education secretary on Tuesday, but only with the help of a historic tiebreaking vote from Vice President Mike Pence after weeks of protests and two defections within her own party. The 51-to-50 vote capped an all-night vigil on the Senate floor, where, one by one, Democrats denounced Ms. DeVos to a mostly empty chamber. But they did not get a third Republican defection that would have stopped Ms. DeVos \u2014 a billionaire who has devoted much of her life to promoting charter schools and vouchers \u2014 from becoming the steward of the nation\u2019s nearly 100,000 public schools. It was the first time a vice president has been summoned to the Capitol to break a tie on a cabinet nomination. Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, demanded before the vote that Republicans explain how they could support Ms. DeVos. \u201cIf we cannot set aside party loyalty long enough to perform the essential duty of vetting the president\u2019s nominees, what are we even doing here?\u201d Mr. Franken asked. The two Republicans who voted against the nominee, Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, said Ms. DeVos was unqualified because of a lack of familiarity with public schools and with laws meant to protect students. \u201cI have serious concerns about a nominee to be secretary of education who has been so involved in one side of the equation, so immersed in the push for vouchers, that she may be unaware of what actually is successful within the public schools, and also what is broken and how to fix them,\u201d Ms. Murkowski said last week when the two announced their opposition. Ms. Murkowski also said she had been influenced by thousands of messages she had received urging her to reject the nomination. For many educators, Ms. DeVos\u2019s support for charter schools and vouchers \u2014 which allow students to use taxpayer dollars to pay tuition at private, religious and for-profit schools \u2014 reflected a deep disconnect from public schools. Neither Ms. DeVos nor any of her children attended a public school. Most Republicans described Ms. DeVos as committed to what is best for children. In a fiery speech moments before the vote, Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee and a former education secretary himself, criticized his Democratic colleagues for opposing Ms. DeVos, he said, simply because she was nominated by a Republican president. \u201cShe led the most effective public school reform movement over the last few years,\u201d he said. Mr. Alexander, the chairman of the committee that approved Ms. DeVos\u2019s nomination last week in a party-line split, said she had been \u201cat the forefront\u201d of education overhaul for decades. By midday Tuesday, as the vote in the Senate deadlocked at 50 to 50, Mr. Pence, a former member of the House, took the gavel and at 12:29 p.m. declared his vote for Ms. DeVos. In a procedural quirk, a confirmation vote on Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama for attorney general was scheduled after that of Ms. DeVos so he could vote \u201cyes\u201d before leaving the Senate, securing Republicans a decisive vote. Raised in a wealthy family, Ms. DeVos, who married into the Amway fortune, has a web of financial investments, has also raised alarm among critics who worried about the many opportunities for conflicts of interest. She was the first of Mr. Trump\u2019s nominees not to complete an ethics review before appearing before a Senate panel. She filed her ethics paperwork on Jan. 19, two days after her confirmation hearing. Teachers\u2019 unions and even some charter organizations had protested Ms. DeVos\u2019s nomination across the country. Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the top Democrat on the committee that approved Ms. DeVos \u2014 and a former educator herself \u2014 urged disheartened advocates on Tuesday morning before the vote not to think of their efforts as a waste. \u201cIt\u2019s made an impact here and made a difference,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s woken each of us up in this country to what we value and what we want.\u201d Shortly after Ms. DeVos\u2019s confirmation, Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, a union that protested the nomination, said the public would now have to \u201cserve as a check and balance\u201d to her policies and be \u201cfierce fighters on behalf of children.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s telling that even when Trump had full control of the legislative and executive branches, he could only get DeVos confirmed by an unprecedented tiebreaking vote by his vice president,\u201d Ms. Weingarten said. \u201cThat\u2019s because DeVos shows an antipathy for public schools, a full-throttled embrace of private, for-profit alternatives and a lack of basic understanding of what children need to succeed in school.\u201d David E. Kirkland, an education professor at New York University who has studied Ms. DeVos\u2019s impact in Michigan, said he feared she could badly hurt public education and pull resources out of schools in need of federal funding. \u201cHer extensive conflicts of interest and record of diverting money away from vulnerable students and into the pockets of the rich make DeVos completely unfit for the position she was just confirmed to,\u201d he said. Ms. DeVos has focused on expanding parental choice in education and on embracing charter schools and vouchers. Her ideology was a good fit for Mr. Trump\u2019s education platform during the campaign, which called for a $20 billion voucher initiative aimed at low-income children. But freeing such an enormous sum would most likely require the reallocation of federal education money, as well as a realignment of congressional priorities. Vouchers were not part of a sweeping education overhaul passed in 2015, and lawmakers from rural areas, where schools tend to be farther apart, are particularly wary of such initiatives. The Trump administration could potentially advance a more limited voucher program and seek tax credits for private school tuition or home schooling costs. Ms. DeVos has also indicated that she would dismantle other pieces of the Obama administration\u2019s legacy, potentially including a rule that denies federal student aid money to for-profit colleges whose graduates struggle to get jobs, as well as an aggressive effort to investigate and adjudicate campus sexual assault claims. Ms. DeVos\u2019s critics said they would continue to fight her as she serves. Some vowed to demonstrate at her appearances at forums and schools and to seek candidates friendly to their view to run for local office. Lily Eskelsen Garc\u00eda, the president of the National Education Association, said her union would tap into the vast database of advocates it had built during Ms. DeVos\u2019s confirmation process to help keep her in check. \u201cAs soon as she does something alarming, it will be known, it will be seen,\u201d she said. \u201cShe won\u2019t be able to hide.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s choice of Ms. DeVos, known for her big-spending lobbying efforts to expand charter schools in Michigan \u2014 an experiment that even charter school supporters now criticize \u2014 to lead the Education Department presented senators with a multitude of potential pitfalls. Her background as a prolific  fund-raiser who has donated about $200 million over the years to Republican causes and candidates \u2014 including some senators, as has been the case for previous presidential nominees \u2014 came under scrutiny. Democrats have also expressed concern about her family\u2019s contributions to groups that support so-called conversion therapy for gay people and her past statements that government \u201csucks\u201d and that public schools are a \u201cdead end.\u201d Opponents have also focused on the poor performance of charter schools in Detroit, which she championed. Senators and education advocates from both sides of the aisle also expressed concern after Ms. DeVos, during her Jan. 17 confirmation hearing, confused core responsibilities of the department. In one notable exchange that spread across the internet, Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, asked Ms. DeVos whether all schools that receive public money should have to follow the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, the landmark 1975 civil rights legislation. Under that federal law, states and school districts are required to provide special education services to children with disabilities. Ms. DeVos said the issue was \u201cbest left to the states.\u201d In a bizarre moment that made her the butt of late-night TV jokes, Ms. DeVos also suggested that states should decide whether to allow guns in schools, citing in part concerns about protection from grizzly bears in Wyoming. \u201cI think probably there, I would imagine there is probably a gun in a school to protect from potential grizzlies,\u201d she said. Before the vote Tuesday, Mr. Franken said, \u201cIt was the most embarrassing confirmation hearing that I have ever seen.\u201d In a final push that included demonstrations around the country, constituents and advocates swamped Senate offices with calls, so inundating the Capitol switchboard that it disrupted the Senate\u2019s voice mail system.",

      "author": "Dana Goldstein",
      "content": " By most any measure, the secretary of education is one of the least powerful cabinet positions. The secretary is 16th in the line of succession to the presidency. Education accounts for a paltry 3 percent of the federal budget, compared with 24 percent for Social Security and 16 percent for defense. And the most recent major federal education law curtailed Washington\u2019s role on testing, standards and accountability, turning much of the firepower in education policy back to states and school districts. That is what has made the protest movement against Betsy DeVos, President Trump\u2019s nominee to be secretary of education, all the more remarkable. After an underwhelming confirmation hearing in which Ms. DeVos seemed ignorant of major provisions of federal education law, such as the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, some Senate offices reported receiving more calls opposing Ms. DeVos than any other Trump nominee. At women\u2019s marches across the country on Jan. 21, protesters carried signs ridiculing her as an out-of-touch billionaire. In Portland, Ore., high school students walked out of class in opposition to Ms. DeVos, and in Anchorage, protesters picketed the office of Senator Lisa Murkowski, a Republican, demanding she vote against the nominee. This week, Ms. Murkowski and Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said they would oppose her confirmation, leaving Ms. DeVos one swing senator away from an embarrassing rejection. On Thursday, calls opposing Ms. DeVos so overwhelmed the Senate phone system that by the afternoon, offices were having trouble gaining access to their voice mail messages. \u201cWe are experiencing heavy call volumes in all our offices,\u201d Senator Dean Heller, a Nevada Republican, wrote Thursday on Twitter. \u201cStaff is answering as many as possible.\u201d The opposition has come from some expected sources: well-funded progressive groups, teachers\u2019 unions and the Democratic Party itself, as well as from grass-roots local parents\u2019 and teachers\u2019 organizations. But as clamorous as these protests have become, Ms. DeVos is also imperiled by a lack of support from constituencies that a Republican nominee might normally count on. As a philanthropist and an advocate, she has fought not only for the expansion of the charter school sector \u2014 a bipartisan cause \u2014 but also for school vouchers, which can allow students to carry taxpayer dollars to private schools, for-profit schools, religious schools and online schools. Nationwide, most charter schools, including those in the best-known networks, like the KIPP schools, are nonprofit. But the opposite is true in Ms. DeVos\u2019s home state, Michigan, where she has wielded great influence over education policy and beat back efforts to increase oversight of charter schools in Detroit. Research suggests that traditional public schools and nonprofit charter schools generally outperform for-profit charters and private schools that accept vouchers, and some organizations representing nonprofit charter schools have come out against Ms. DeVos. The Massachusetts Charter Public School Association wrote a letter to Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat, last month saying that it was \u201cdeeply concerned that efforts to grow school choice without a rigorous accountability system will reduce the quality of charter schools across the country.\u201d On Wednesday, the philanthropist Eli Broad, a leading funder of nonprofit charter schools, wrote to Senators Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican majority leader, and Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic minority leader, opposing Ms. DeVos\u2019s confirmation. \u201cBefore Mrs. DeVos\u2019s hearing, I had serious concerns about her support for unregulated charter schools and vouchers as well as the potential conflicts of interest she might bring to the job,\u201d Mr. Broad wrote, possibly alluding to investments she has made in education-related companies. \u201cHer testimony not only reinforced my concerns but also added to them.\u201d School choice may not do much to help sparsely populated rural communities, a factor Ms. Collins and Ms. Murkowski cited in their decisions to oppose Ms. DeVos. And the idea of having children attend virtual schools at a computer screen, while a growing practice, leaves many parents and educators cold. \u201cIn rural Alaska, there is one school, and that\u2019s the hub of the community,\u201d said Alyse Galvin, a mother of four and a founder of Great Alaska Schools, which has organized opposition in the state to Ms. DeVos. \u201cThat\u2019s where people hang. It\u2019s where the warmth is. In some of these places, it\u2019s where the only running water is.\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t imagine it if you haven\u2019t been there,\u201d she continued. Ms. DeVos, she said, \u201chasn\u2019t been there.\u201d Some in the self-described education reform community have greeted Ms. DeVos\u2019s nomination warmly. The National Alliance for Public Charter Schools, an advocacy group based in Washington, has endorsed her. \u201cThroughout her career Mrs. DeVos has worked to empower parents and give families strong educational options, so they can do what is best for their child,\u201d the group said in a statement when her nomination was announced. \u201cWe look forward to working with Mrs. DeVos.\u201d She has also attracted support from Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor and presidential candidate, who supports school accountability and has close ties to for-profit educational efforts. Eva Moskowitz, the founder of the Success Academy charter school network in New York City, and herself a lightning rod for using confrontational political tactics, is one nonprofit charter leader who has vocally supported Ms. DeVos. \u201cI don\u2019t personally want to run virtual schools,\u201d Ms. Moskowitz said. \u201cI like seeing the children, and I think building loving communities is something that is personally important. But should they be an option and can they be done well? I believe yes.\u201d \u201cWhat we should be worried about is that so many millions of children are not getting a good education,\u201d she added. On Friday, the Senate voted to advance Ms. DeVos\u2019s nomination to a final confirmation vote, expected early next week. All 48 senators in the Democratic caucus are expected to oppose her. Even with the two Republicans against her, Ms. DeVos could still be confirmed because Vice President Mike Pence would have the tiebreaking vote. But a third Republican \u201cnay\u201d vote would doom her. It has not helped Ms. DeVos that she exemplifies much that liberals find objectionable about the Trump administration. She is a Christian conservative, an heir to the Amway fortune and a longtime Republican Party donor. At her confirmation hearing, she would not commit to following a number of President Barack Obama\u2019s education regulations, on matters including campus sexual assault and reining in low-performing for-profit colleges. Then she ran into the political-entertainment buzz saw, which has made maximum use of some of her (unintentionally) humorous comments at her confirmation hearing. Millions of people have viewed a \u201cDaily Show\u201d segment in which Trevor Noah excoriates her as unqualified, focusing on her statement that guns should be allowed in schools to protect children against \u201cgrizzlies.\u201d Celebrities including Michael Moore and Olivia Wilde have spoken out against her. The late night host Jimmy Kimmel said Ms. DeVos \u201chas no experience in education\u201d and noted that her children had attended private schools. If grizzly bears are a problem in public schools, he joked, maybe Sarah Palin, the former Alaska governor, should be secretary of education. But Ms. DeVos is not the first nominee to lack hands-on experience in running a school system or to hold controversial views. The first secretary, Shirley Hufstedler, appointed by President Jimmy Carter in 1979, was a federal judge. President Ronald Reagan\u2019s second-term pick, William J. Bennett, had strong ties to the religious right and was known for picking fights on hot-button issues like bilingual education and affirmative action. Yet even these nominees were confirmed with bipartisan support and little notice from the public. This level of opposition \u201cwould have been shocking in Bill Bennett\u2019s time,\u201d said Grover J. Whitehurst, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former Education Department official under President George W. Bush. \u201cThere was a deference to the president and his ability to have his cabinet appointments, and an institutional respect in the Senate. That has evaporated.\u201d \u201cPoor Mrs. DeVos is a victim of her poor performance in her hearing,\u201d he said, \u201cbut also of broader political theater.\u201d",

GreenPRINT EDITIONGraduates Meet DeVos With Their Backs Turned|May 11, 2017, Page A18",
      "author": "Erica L. Green",
      "content": " Betsy DeVos went to Bethune-Cookman University on Wednesday, knowing her first commencement address as secretary of education could get ugly at the historically black institute of higher education. It did \u2014 fast. Over sporadic heckling, and at some points to the backs of gown-clad graduates refusing to face her, Ms. DeVos implored: \u201cOne of the hallmarks of higher education, and of democracy, is the ability to converse with and learn from those with whom we disagree. And while we will undoubtedly disagree at times, I hope we can do so respectfully. Let\u2019s choose to hear each other out.\u201d The crowd obliged only a handful of times during her roughly 20-minute-speech. Since squeaking through Senate confirmation on the tiebreaking vote of Vice President Mike Pence, Ms. DeVos has appeared at times to carry the weight of every Trump administration controversy on her shoulders. She was turned away by a handful of protesters at her first school visit as secretary. She was goaded into an Ohio public school visit by an antagonist, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, Randi Weingarten. And in the days before her address at Bethune-Cookman, in Daytona Beach, Fla., opponents made it clear with petitions and protests that she would not be all that welcome. The school\u2019s president, Edison O. Jackson, had to pause the ceremony about one minute into Ms. DeVos\u2019s address to tell the crowd of students, \u201cIf this behavior continues, your degrees will be mailed to you.\u201d Above the jeers, Ms. DeVos delivered the standard exhortation to graduates to live a life of service, with courage and grace in the spirit of their school\u2019s namesake. It was a message that thousands believed Ms. DeVos \u2014 who many contend represents an administration that has shown only superficial knowledge of and support for historically black colleges and universities \u2014 was in no position to deliver to the 380 graduates of the school, which was founded by the educator and civil rights activist Mary McLeod Bethune. Critics of Ms. DeVos pointed to missteps from the outset of her tenure: from her office\u2019s misspelling the name of W.E.B. DuBois in an attempted tribute, to a statement she issued calling segregation-era historically black colleges and universities \u201cpioneers of school choice.\u201d The gaffes, coupled with President Trump\u2019s seemingly wavering support for black higher education and a strained relationship with African-Americans, made Ms. DeVos an especially prickly choice. \u201cEven though she apologized, she has shown how tone deaf she is, and how disconnected she is from our community,\u201d said Dominik Whitehead, a 2010 graduate of Bethune-Cookman, who generated the first petition calling for Ms. DeVos to be replaced as this year\u2019s graduation speaker. Activists dropped off boxes of petitions, which they said had more than 50,000 signatures, to the school\u2019s administration on Tuesday night in a last-ditch effort to stop Ms. DeVos from speaking. In a letter to the community defending the choice of Ms. DeVos, Mr. Jackson wrote, \u201cI am of the belief that it does not benefit our students to suppress voices that we disagree with, or to limit students to only those perspectives that are broadly sanctioned by a specific community.\u201d Other prominent black leaders also defended the university\u2019s decision to invite Ms. DeVos. Michael Lomax, president and chief executive of the United Negro College Fund, wrote on Twitter shortly after Ms. DeVos was named speaker, \u201cI believe we should hear Secretary DeVos at @bethunecookman, just as we want her and President Trump to hear the voices of #HBCUs.\u201d The jeers crescendoed when Ms. DeVos said that she would visit the childhood home and grave site of Ms. Bethune. \u201cHer commitment to service is what has brought us together today. This inspired daughter of slaves refused to accept repulsive and systemic racism,\u201d Ms. DeVos said. \u201cShe moved mountains, changing the lives and futures of countless students and families across generations.\u201d But Ms. DeVos drew cheers when she highlighted individual Bethune-Cookman graduates by name and described the challenges they overcame to graduate, and when she praised graduates who were pursuing a career in teaching. She also used the opportunity to reiterate her support for historically black higher education. Last week, after Mr. Trump questioned the constitutionality of a 25-year-old program that helps black colleges finance, renovate and replace their buildings, Ms. DeVos swiftly issued a statement saying she would fight for the colleges and universities. A backlash forced Mr. Trump to pledge his \u201cunwavering support\u201d for African-American higher education. In her speech, Ms. DeVos said she wanted to reaffirm the administration\u2019s commitment and cited its decision to restore year-round Pell Grants, which many low-income students use to finance their college educations. \u201cI am at the table fighting on your behalf, and on behalf of all students across this great nation,\u201d she said. But Jasmine Smith, 21, a rising junior at Bethune-Cookman, said she was worried about other measures Ms. DeVos\u2019s department had taken that could affect the next two years at Bethune-Cookman. Her biggest worry was Ms. DeVos\u2019s decision to roll back protections for student loan borrowers. Ms. Smith was among about 100 protesters who gathered at Bethune-Cookman several hours before Ms. DeVos was to deliver her address Wednesday morning. \u201cI\u2019m protesting because she will continue to directly affect me after this and make it harder for me to get to graduation,\u201d she said. Mr. Whitehead said he did not believe that Ms. DeVos\u2019s speech contained any promises of substance, and called the graduates\u2019 demonstration of contempt for her \u201can amazing moment.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m proud of what happened,\u201d Mr. Whitehead said. \u201cI hope for the sake of the institution, the sake of the students and the graduates, that regardless of the protests and the petitions, she really wants to build this relationship \u2014 that this is the real thing.\u201d Ms. DeVos ended her speech by encouraging the students to maintain grace as they face adversity and dissent. \u201cThe natural instinct is to join in the chorus of conflict, to make your voice louder, your point bigger and your position stronger,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we will not solve the significant and real problems our country faces if we cannot bring ourselves to embrace a mind-set of grace.\u201d",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 The newly minted education secretary, Betsy DeVos, fled a small group of protesters outside a middle school here on Friday, at one point hiding in her sport utility vehicle as a man wielded a cardboard sign, before she finally entered. Video of the odd episode at Jefferson Middle School Academy from a local television station showed a handful of people heckling and following Ms. DeVos as she tried to enter the school. She turned away with a man escorting her as one demonstrator shouted, \u201cGo back! Shame, shame.\u201d The exchange could be the first of many such encounters as protesters and opponents of Ms. DeVos say they plan to remind her of the fierce opposition she faced throughout her nomination process and continues to face as she weighs sweeping policies, such as encouraging private school vouchers. Activists have said they would protest her at every opportunity, including during school visits. Her response to the protesters on Friday could encourage more. \u201cWe will unleash our activists in a way that I don\u2019t think any secretary of education has ever experienced,\u201d said Heidi Hess, a campaign manager for Credo, a mobile phone company with a liberal activist arm. \u201cIf she holds field hearings, we will make sure we pack them with activists. If she travels for meetings or if she visits schools, we will confront her with protesters and have people lined up to ask her questions.\u201d As word spread that Ms. DeVos, a wealthy Republican donor with almost no experience in public education, had been blocked from entering the school, Arne Duncan, a former education secretary under President Barack Obama, weighed in. Ms. DeVos eventually made it into the school and later told reporters the school was \u201cawesome.\u201d \u201cIt was really wonderful to visit this school, and I look forward to many visits of many great public schools, both in D.C. and around the country,\u201d Ms. DeVos said. \u201cThanks very much.\u201d Mayor Muriel Bowser of Washington also said that the city wants Ms. DeVos to visit its schools. Democrats have expressed concern about contributions by Ms. DeVos\u2019s family to groups that support so-called conversion therapy for gay people; her donations to Republicans and their causes, which she agreed have totaled about $200 million over the years; and her past statements that government \u201csucks\u201d and that public schools are a \u201cdead end.\u201d Education unions and activists flooded senators with emails and phone calls urging them to vote against Ms. DeVos. Two Republican senators, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, joined Democrats in voting against her. Vice President Mike Pence had to cast a tiebreaking vote to get Ms. DeVos confirmed.",

      "subtitle": "Betsy DeVos Invests in a Therapy Under ScrutinyThe nominee for education secretary is a chief investor in Neurocore, a group of brain performance centers whose methods have been questioned.By Sheri Fink, Steve Eder and Matthew GoldsteinPRINT EDITIONDeVos Invests in a Therapy Under Doubt|January 31, 2017, Page A1",
      "author": "Sheri Fink",
      "content": "   A group of brain performance centers backed by Betsy DeVos, the nominee for education secretary, promotes results that are nothing short of stunning: improvements reported by 91 percent of patients with depression, 90 percent with attention deficit disorder, 90 percent with anxiety. The treatment offered by Neurocore, a business in which Ms. DeVos and her husband, Dick, are the chief investors, consists of showing movies to patients and interrupting them when the viewers become distracted, in an effort to retrain their brains. With eight centers in Michigan and Florida and plans to expand, Neurocore says it has assessed about 10,000 people for health problems that often require medication. \u201cIs it time for a mind makeover?\u201d the company asks in its advertising. \u201cAll it takes is science.\u201d But a review of Neurocore\u2019s claims and interviews with medical experts suggest its conclusions are unproven and its methods questionable. Neurocore has not published its results in peer-reviewed medical literature. Its techniques \u2014 including mapping brain waves to diagnose problems and using neurofeedback, a form of biofeedback, to treat them \u2014 are not considered standards of care for the majority of the disorders it treats, including autism. Social workers, not doctors, perform assessments, and low-paid technicians with little training apply the methods to patients, including children with complex problems. In interviews, nearly a dozen child psychiatrists and psychologists with expertise in autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or A.D.H.D., expressed caution regarding some of Neurocore\u2019s assertions, advertising and methods. \u201cThis causes real harm to children because it diverts attention, hope and resources,\u201d said Dr. Matthew Siegel, a child psychiatrist at Maine Behavioral Healthcare and associate professor at Tufts School of Medicine, who co-wrote autism practice standards for the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. \u201cIf there were something out there that was uniquely powerful and wonderful, we\u2019d all be using it.\u201d Neurocore rejects any suggestion that its treatments do not work as advertised. Dr. Majid Fotuhi, Neurocore chief medical officer, said, \u201cThere is significant research to support the efficacy of neurofeedback for a variety of mental and behavioral health issues.\u201d Ms. DeVos, whose appointment as education secretary is expected to be voted on Tuesday morning by a Senate committee, had said she would leave Neurocore\u2019s board, but would retain her investment in the company, which she valued at $5 million to $25 million, according to documents filed this month with the Office of Government Ethics. Last Friday, a group of Democratic senators sent Ms. DeVos a letter saying that her financial disclosure raised questions about potential conflicts. The senators were skeptical of the DeVos family trusts, and also raised questions about Neurocore, which called itself educational in a trademark dispute. The lawmakers asked Ms. DeVos if she would commit that she and her family members would not \u201cbenefit financially from actions\u201d she could take in her new role. At Neurocore\u2019s clinics, children and adults with A.D.H.D., anxiety, depression, autism and other psychological and neurological diagnoses sit before monitors watching movies or television shows ranging from \u201cFrozen\u201d to \u201cMad Men,\u201d with sensors attached to their scalps and earlobes. Whenever they become distracted or anxious, the video automatically freezes. That feedback, known as conditioning, leads the vast majority of clients, company officers say, to experience improvements in their disorders after 30 45-minute sessions costing about $2,000. Some insurers cover the treatments, while others have denied payment. One denial concerned a 50-year-old woman with anxiety and migraines. The insurance company noted that it covered biofeedback for only a few conditions. An outside review commissioned by the Michigan insurance department supported the decision that biofeedback was not, in her case, an established therapy or medically necessary. Experts said that thus far, studies of neurofeedback for attention deficit disorder were unconvincing. It \u201cisn\u2019t shown to be better than placebo, and the effects are not long-lasting,\u201d said Sandra K. Loo, director of pediatric neuropsychology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles, who has written about neurofeedback and quantitative EEG, a brain-wave test that Neurocore performs as part of its diagnosis. \u201cPeople pay a ton of money,\u201d Dr. Loo said. \u201cThey\u2019re desperate to help their kids. Many are desperate to not give medications.\u201d Dr. L. Eugene Arnold, an emeritus professor of psychiatry at Ohio State University who is enrolling children in a large, blind, controlled trial of neurofeedback \u2014 the main approach Neurocore says it uses in its sessions \u2014 said the idea was theoretically appealing, but there was not yet solid evidence of its effectiveness for A.D.H.D. Neurocore\u2019s claims for the treatments \u201cpoison the well,\u201d he said. \u201cThey oversell it.\u201d He and other experts warned of potential side effects including headaches and disrupted sleep. Federal oversight of the field is minimal. \u201cWhen it comes to treatments like this, there\u2019s no formal body,\u201d said Scott O. Lilienfeld, a professor of psychology at Emory University. \u201cThis has been a big problem. We don\u2019t have an F.D.A. for psychotherapies,\u201d he said, referring to the Food and Drug Administration. Over the past year, the Federal Trade Commission has begun to crack down on some companies promoting the successes of brain training programs for treating a variety of problems. Last January, Lumos Labs, the creator of Lumosity games, agreed to pay a $2 million fine over advertising claims that said its educational-oriented games could help children perform better in school by targeting specific areas of the brain. A few months later, the F.T.C. imposed sanctions on the developers of the LearningRx \u201cbrain training\u201d programs for advertisements that claimed its product could \u201cpermanently improve serious health conditions\u201d like A.D.H.D., autism and dementia. At Neurocore, patients range from young children with A.D.H.D., to older adults who are concerned about memory health, to athletes wanting to improve their performance. Neurocore promotes its ties to the Orlando Magic, which is owned by the DeVos family, and other professional athletes have appeared in advertisements for the company. Dr. Fotuhi, Neurocore\u2019s chief medical officer, said that there were no physicians on site at the clinics, but social workers supervise lower-level technicians, who administer the neurofeedback. Employment ads show that Neurocore\u2019s social workers are offered less than $20 an hour to start, yet are responsible for diagnostic assessments of patients with complex problems. One technician, Bashar Salah, who worked for Neurocore as a new college graduate during the summer of 2015 in Sterling Heights, Mich., said some of his colleagues were still students. He earned $10 or $11 an hour, he said, \u201cbetter than working at McDonald\u2019s or Wendy\u2019s, or a lot of other places that paid roughly minimum wage.\u201d Mr. Salah said he had known nothing about biofeedback before starting the job, but received training at Neurocore, where the employees seemed \u201cinterested in improving people\u2019s lives.\u201d Amanda Farmer, who said she worked as a technician at a Neurocore center in Okemos, Mich., for eight months in 2012, watched potential clients get a hard sell. \u201cA lot of people were skeptical, and they gloss over any of the real questions: \u2018Are you sure? This seems like a lot of money. What happens if it doesn\u2019t do anything?\u2019\u201d Ms. Farmer recalled. Other current and former employees expressed similar misgivings. Experts say there is not much standardization in the field of biofeedback, and techniques vary. Dr. Fotuhi has impressive credentials: an M.D. from Harvard and Ph.D. in neuroscience from Johns Hopkins. However, his short-lived previous venture, NeurExpand Brain Centers in Maryland, folded after Medicare refused to reimburse services and demanded repayment for lack of scientific evidence of their effectiveness, Dr. Fotuhi said in 2015 to Bethesda Magazine. In an interview, Dr. Fotuhi said Neurocore\u2019s chief executive, Mark Murrison, who has been at the company for about two years, \u201chas an emphasis on research and development and using science-based protocols.\u201d He said the company would be publishing its results in peer-reviewed scientific literature soon. \u201cWe are proud that our clients are highly satisfied with the care they receive and that we are able to help transform the lives of our clients for the better,\u201d Dr. Fotuhi added in a statement. Ms. DeVos maintains her interest in Neurocore even as she said she would divest from 102 companies and investment funds, including a family vehicle that backs business start-ups. Ms. DeVos and her husband are invested in Neurocore through the Windquest Group, their family office. Experts said that Ms. DeVos, as a result of the investment, might have to recuse herself from discussions about the efficacy of using brain-training strategies to help school-age children. A spokesman for Ms. DeVos, however, disagreed that her stake in Neurocore was problematic. \u201cWe reject the notion that the judgment of the Office of Government Ethics is incapable of identifying potential conflicts of interests, or that the judgment of the professionals who work there should be supplemented or supplanted by personal opinions and partisan recommendations,\u201d said Ed Patru, a spokesman for Ms. DeVos. Ms. DeVos is expected to receive enough votes from the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee \u2014 and eventually the full Senate \u2014 for confirmation. The nomination of Ms. DeVos, an outspoken critic of public education who favors charter schools, has antagonized supporters of public schools and prompted some protests. Neurocore is the creation of Timothy G. Royer, a licensed psychologist with a master\u2019s degree in theology, who served as division chief of pediatric psychology at the Helen DeVos Children\u2019s Hospital in Grand Rapids, Mich. Originally called Hope 139, after Psalm 139 from the Bible, the company marketed itself to schools \u2014 especially religious ones \u2014 in Michigan to help children improve academic scores and lessen the need for medication to treat certain ailments. Ms. DeVos and her husband began supporting the company in 2008, for a time hosting the company in the offices of Windquest. The company\u2019s next step, Dr. Fotuhi said, will be to start 12-week boot camps to \u201chelp the elderly with memory problems.\u201d",

Here\u2019s Why It Probably Won\u2019t Happen.A proposal to cut $17.6 million from the Special Olympics is drawing widespread opposition, but it\u2019s unlikely to make it past Congress anyway.By Sarah MervoshPRINT EDITIONMarch 28, 2019",
      "author": "Sarah Mervosh",
      "content": " Education Secretary Betsy DeVos faced scathing criticism this week over a budget proposal that calls for eliminating funding for the Special Olympics, as members of Congress voiced opposition at a hearing that drew widespread attention and stoked a strong defense of the organization across the internet. \u201cI still can\u2019t understand why you would go after disabled children in your budget,\u201d Representative Barbara Lee, Democrat of California, told Ms. DeVos during the hearing on Tuesday, held by a House subcommittee. \u201cYou zero that out. It\u2019s appalling.\u201d The $17.6 million in proposed cuts to the Special Olympics comes as the Education Department faces an overall budget reduction of 10 percent. President Trump\u2019s budget for next year proposed cutting funding to education for the third year in a row, as he places a priority on the military, as well as the construction of a wall along the border with Mexico. As Ms. DeVos\u2019s exchange with skeptical House Democrats took off online, the proposal drew condemnation from across the political spectrum. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a Democratic presidential candidate, called the proposed cuts \u201cunbelievable.\u201d John Kasich, the former governor of Ohio and a 2016 Republican presidential candidate, said they were \u201coutrageous.\u201d Derek Schottle, an athlete with special needs who dreams of competing on a global stage told The Washington Post he was \u201cpraying for the Special Olympics.\u201d But education and political experts quickly cautioned that the proposal was not set in stone. And by Wednesday, Ms. DeVos had issued a statement addressing the controversy. Ms. DeVos defended the plan, saying that while she personally supported the mission of the Special Olympics, the federal government could not fund every worthy nonprofit organization. Here is a quick overview of what you need to know about Ms. DeVos\u2019s budget and her position on the Special Olympics. No. The cuts were recommended earlier this month as part of  Mr. Trump\u2019s overall budget proposal for the 2020 fiscal year, but they have not gone into effect and still require approval from Congress. The president sent Congress a record $4.75 trillion budget plan, which calls for increased military spending and sharp cuts to domestic programs like education. The budget for the Education Department was set at $64 billion \u2014 about $7 billion less than in 2019. The Education Department did not respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. In its proposal on how to spend that money, the department suggested eliminating 29 programs that have \u201cachieved their original purpose, duplicate other programs, are narrowly focused, or are unable to demonstrate effectiveness,\u201d according to budget documents. The Special Olympics would be \u201cbetter supported with other Federal, State, local, or private funds,\u201d the proposal said. Mr. Trump\u2019s budgets largely failed to gain traction in previous years, when fellow Republicans controlled both chambers. And Congress has repeatedly rejected efforts to reduce the Education Department\u2019s spending \u2014 lawmakers instead increased funding for the department last year. Mr. Trump\u2019s budget is likely to face significant Democratic opposition this year, with Democrats in control of the House. Democratic leaders in both chambers quickly pronounced the budget dead on arrival after it was proposed this month. In addition to offering more than 30 Olympic-style sports for people with intellectual disabilities, including a signature World Games competition, the Special Olympics also offers programming in schools. A program to promote inclusion and prevent bullying in U.S. schools is funded by the Department of Education, the organization said on its website. The program has reached nearly 6,500 schools across the country. A spokesman for the Special Olympics did not respond to requests for comment Wednesday. In an interview on MSNBC, the organization\u2019s chairman, Timothy Shriver, said that the program offered opportunities for students with intellectual disabilities to interact with their peers and helped foster an inclusive culture in schools. \u201cWe are now in a new ballgame of trying to educate young people about the importance of an inclusive mind-set to the future of the country,\u201d Mr. Shriver said. \u201cThe country is starving for this,\u201d he added. \u201cRepublicans, Democrats, rich, poor, black, white, urban, suburban, gay, straight. I have to say almost everybody when they see this, they say, \u2018My god, what a breath of fresh air.\u2019\u201d Ms. DeVos defended her budget\u2019s overall approach and touted its fiscal discipline, but faced sharp questions at Tuesday\u2019s hearing, including from Representative Mark Pocan, Democrat of Wisconsin, who said that he had two nephews with autism. \u201cDo you know how many kids are going to be affected by that cut, Madame Secretary?\u201d Mr. Pocan asked. \"We had to make some difficult decisions with this budget,\u201d Ms. DeVos replied, acknowledging that she was not sure the exact number of children affected by the proposed funding cuts to the Special Olympics. \"I think Special Olympics is an awesome organization,\u201d Ms. DeVos said, \u201cone that is well supported by the philanthropic sector as well.\u201d In her statement on Wednesday, Ms. DeVos said that her department had allocated millions of dollars for students with disabilities. \u201cMake no mistake: we are focused every day on raising expectations and improving outcomes for infants and toddlers, children and youth with disabilities,\u201d she said. But the Special Olympics is a private organization \u2014 not a federal program \u2014 that raises millions each year, according to her statement. \u201cGiven our current budget realities,\u201d she said, \u201cthe federal government cannot fund every worthy program, particularly ones that enjoy robust support from private donations.\u201d When asked about Ms. DeVos\u2019s statement on MSNBC, Mr. Shriver said, \u201cWe just disagree completely.\u201d \u201cThis is Education 101,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat do you send your kids to school for?\u201d he said. \u201cRead, write, of course. But to learn how to respect the fact that everybody matters? Big lesson. Our athletes are teaching it.\u201d Ms. DeVos, a billionaire who comes from a politically powerful and wealthy Michigan family, pledged not to accept her government paychecks and got the approval to give away her $199,700 salary last year. She chose four organizations and called them to tell them they would evenly split the money. The Special Olympics was one of them. In her statement, Ms. DeVos said she had strong admiration for the Special Olympics. \u201cI love its work,\u201d she said, \u201cand I have personally supported its mission.\u201d",

David French in National Review: Mr. French believes that critics of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos\u2019s plan to reform Title IX procedures for cases of sexual assault on college campuses \u201cbelieve and propagate a pile of junk science seasoned with a heaping helping of far-left ideology.\u201d He questions the statistics most often cited by \u201ctrue campus ideologue\u201d activists that \u201ccome unglued at the mere mention of \u2018due process.\u2019\u201d Read more \u00bb _____  Ashe Schow in The Federalist: Ms. DeVos hopes to establish a firmer definition of sexual assault, which Ms. Schow hopes will stop the trend \u201ccreating victims out of students who aren\u2019t actually victims.\u201d Due process can never be an impediment to justice, Ms. Schow writes, and \u201cremoval of due process\u201d might have impact beyond college campuses.

      "content": " By the end of her first full week as the secretary of education, Betsy DeVos had already sparred with a middle school and a former schools chancellor in Washington, accused some of the school\u2019s teachers of passively awaiting instruction and said she would be pleased if the department she currently runs did not exist in the future. She encountered an immediate display of the type of fierce resistance she will face as she tries to set new policies for the Education Department. On Sunday, she received a somewhat warmer welcome from the New York City schools chancellor, Carmen Fari\u00f1a, who said in a radio interview that she was ready to work with Ms. DeVos. Even as she urged Ms. DeVos not to cut funding for the city\u2019s public schools, Ms. Fari\u00f1a said that despite their ideological differences, the two could make sure that children are properly educated. \u201cI work with everyone,\u201d Ms. Fari\u00f1a said. \u201cI will have conversations with anyone and everyone to ensure that the work we\u2019re doing here is being celebrated and recognized, and we\u2019ll see what time will bring.\u201d In interviews with two online news organizations, Ms. DeVos began laying the groundwork for her approach. \u201cIt would be fine with me to have myself worked out of a job,\u201d she told Axios, adding that she expects there will be more public charter schools, private schools and virtual schools under her leadership. She told Townhall, a conservative outlet, that she doubted the validity of the demonstrations against her and that her critics and protesters wanted to make her life \u201ca living hell.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think most of those are spontaneous, genuine protests,\u201d she said. \u201cI think they\u2019re all being sponsored and very carefully planned.\u201d She said in the Townhall interview that she planned to focus on rolling out the Every Student Succeeds Act, a policy signed into law by President Barack Obama, while also pushing for controversial school choice policies like voucher programs. It was her visit to Jefferson Middle School Academy in Washington, where protesters briefly blocked her from entering, that set off several days of online bickering. After speaking to teachers at the school, she called the visit \u201cwonderful,\u201d only to tell Townhall that she saw problems with the teachers. \u201cI visited a school on Friday and met with some wonderful, genuine, sincere teachers who pour their heart and soul into their classrooms and their students,\u201d Ms. DeVos said. \u201cBut I can tell the attitude is more of a \u2018receive mode.\u2019 They\u2019re waiting to be told what they have to do, and that\u2019s not going to bring success to an individual child.\u201d The school posted 11 tweets in rapid succession defending its teachers, saying of Ms. DeVos, \u201cWe\u2019re about to take her to school.\u201d The school said that one of the classrooms Ms. DeVos visited was led by two teachers who serve students whose reading levels range from first grade to eighth grade, and who \u201cmaintain a positive classroom environment focused on rigorous content, humor and love.\u201d A former Washington schools chancellor, Kaya Henderson, also voiced her displeasure with Ms. DeVos on Twitter. Ms. DeVos appeared to try to make amends in a pair of tweets. In its interview, Axios asked Ms. DeVos what role the federal government would play in education in her ideal world. \u201cIt would be fine with me to have myself worked out of a job, but I\u2019m not sure that \u2014 I\u2019m not sure that there will be a champion movement in Congress to do that,\u201d she answered. She did say that the Education Department has historically helped protect students and keep them safe, citing segregation and providing equal opportunities for girls\u2019 athletics, but she said there were few current issues that warranted federal intervention.",

GreenPRINT EDITIONRules on For-Profit Schools Are Repealed|June 29, 2019, Page A15",
      "author": "Erica L. Green",
      "content": " Education Secretary Betsy DeVos on Friday officially repealed an Obama-era regulation that sought to crack down on for-profit colleges and universities that produced graduates with no meaningful job prospects and mountains of student debt they could not hope to repay. The so-called gainful employment rule was issued by the Obama administration in 2014, right before huge for-profit chains collapsed, leaving students stranded with debt and worthless degrees. Under the new standards, career and certificate programs, many of which operate in the for-profit sector, would have to prove their graduates could find gainful employment to maintain access to federal financial aid. It also would have required schools to disclose in advertisements a comparison of the student debt load of their graduates and their career earnings. In her first two years in office, Ms. DeVos has delayed critical parts of the rule, and last year, she sought to repeal it entirely, siding with for-profit industry leaders and congressional conservatives who have contended that the Obama administration unfairly targeted for-profit schools. Education Department officials have argued that transparency, not regulation, is the best way to hold all schools \u2014 public nonprofits, community colleges and for-profits \u2014 accountable for their results. Instead of any accountability measures, it promised to expand an existing database, called the College Scorecard, to provide information on student debt and earnings prospects. The database, which provides information, including loan debt information, for 2,100 certificate granting programs, was unveiled last month. On Friday, Ms. DeVos said that the scorecard was \u201conly the beginning.\u201d \u201cThese important reforms are a more complete and effective way to hold all types of higher education institutions accountable and make sure that students have a full suite of data when making a decision about their education,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cThis administration will continue to put students first and make sure they not only have a multitude of pathways to success post-high school but also the information they need to make the best choices for themselves.\u201d But in rescinding the rule, the department is eradicating the most fearsome accountability measure \u2014 the loss of federal aid \u2014 for schools that promise to furnish students with specific career skills but fail to prepare them for the job market, leaving taxpayers on the hook to pay back their loans. Congressional Democrats and student advocates said rescinding the rule would leave the scandal-scarred for-profit college industry unchecked. The repeal will take effect July 2020. The department estimated that repealing the rule would cost $6.2 billion over 10 years, which includes funding grants and loans to students attending schools that would have been cut off from federal funding under the Obama rule. \u201cRepealing \u2014 rather than revising or replacing \u2014 the gainful employment rule will prop up low-quality for-profit colleges at the expense of students and taxpayers,\u201d said Representative Robert C. Scott of Virginia, the chairman of the House education panel. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement underscores the need for Congress to pass a comprehensive reauthorization of the Higher Education Act that protects students and taxpayers from low quality for-profit schools.\u201d Bob Shireman, a senior fellow at the Century Foundation and an architect of the rule when he was in the Obama administration, called the repeal \u201cdisturbing and shortsighted.\u201d \u201cThey are opening the door to operators whose singular focus on gobbling up federal grants and loans for their investors will steer the business toward manipulative recruiting and poor quality training,\u201d he said. The Obama administration began drafting the regulations when the for-profit college sector was booming, with large chains enrolling 500,000 students at a time. But it was seen as a crucial safeguard against predatory colleges after the collapse of ITT Tech and Corinthian Colleges beginning in 2015. The Obama administration also tried to channel loan relief to graduates who were defrauded by their colleges. Ms. DeVos has moved to overhaul that \u201cborrower-defense\u201d rule as well, hoping to give some students only partial relief. That process has been tied up in court proceedings, leaving more than 150,000 student claims in limbo. One part of the gainful employment rule that had already been put into place has identified hundreds of failing programs, many of which went on to close after they were measured against the new standards. In the Education Department\u2019s first assessment of debt-to-earnings ratios for college graduates, about 98 percent of programs that failed to meet standards for earning power were for-profits. An analysis included in the department\u2019s final rule also shows that for-profits continued to have a significantly higher failure rate. But the department argued in its final rule that the debt-to-earnings formula created by the Obama administration was \u201cfundamentally flawed\u201d and did not account for factors other than the quality of an education that could affect students\u2019 earning potential. The department also said that the rule did not properly account for other kinds of programs that have poor career outcomes and high debt, such as some liberal arts degrees. For-profit leaders have said that although the Obama rule was never fully enforced, its intent already shut down the worst-performing schools in their sector. Since 2010, when the Obama administration began deliberating the rules, more than 2,000 for-profit and career programs \u2014 nearly half \u2014 have closed, and the industry\u2019s student population has dropped by more than 1.6 million. \u201cThe U.S. Department of Education\u2019s final decision commits our nation\u2019s entire higher education system to full transparency,\u201d said Steve Gunderson, the president of Career Education Colleges and Universities, the for-profit trade group. \u201cInstead of picking and choosing winners and losers in higher education, the department will make available, in a student-friendly and transparent manner, key data points at a program level for all programs at all schools.\u201d",

A final confirmation vote is set for this week.By Emmarie HuettemanPRINT EDITIONFebruary 8, 2017",
      "author": "Emmarie Huetteman",
      "content": " From the moment she was introduced in late November as President Trump\u2019s nominee for education secretary, Betsy DeVos has taken heat from not only teachers\u2019 unions but also some charter school advocates and parent groups. Ms. DeVos, a wealthy Republican fund-raiser and philanthropist who is a major supporter of school vouchers, has faced vociferous opposition. Her support for directing taxpayer dollars to privately run schools, and her efforts to shape education in her home state of Michigan and across the country, elicited criticism from opponents who argued that she had neglected the public schools she would be charged with improving as the head of the Department of Education. Ms. DeVos endured a grueling line of questioning from senators during her confirmation hearing last month. While Republicans praised what they called her commitment to education and to children, Democrats said they were startled by many of her answers, which they said laid bare the weaknesses of an education secretary pick who has little experience with public schools. They expressed their concern as well about the potential for conflicts of interest in her complex web of financial investments; Ms. DeVos was the first of Mr. Trump\u2019s nominees not to complete an ethics review before appearing before senators. Ms. DeVos faced a number of uncomfortable questions, which critics said showed a lack of familiarity with laws protecting students with disabilities and the metrics for assessing student progress. In addition to pointing out Ms. DeVos\u2019s inexperience in running a large bureaucracy, Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, questioned how she could manage the Department of Education \u2014 the largest provider of student loans \u2014 if neither she nor her children had ever borrowed money for school. \u201cSo you have no personal experience with college financial aid?\u201d she asked. As demonstrations popped up across the country, thousands of calls and messages flooded the Capitol, many of them urging senators to vote against Ms. DeVos and Mr. Trump\u2019s other nominees. In a move that put Ms. DeVos\u2019s nomination in question, two Republican senators \u2014 Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska \u2014 announced last week that they would not vote to confirm her, citing the concerns of their constituents. \u201cI have serious concerns about a nominee to be secretary of education who has been so involved in one side of the equation, so immersed in the push for vouchers, that she may be unaware of what actually is successful within the public schools, and also what is broken and how to fix them,\u201d Ms. Murkowski said on the Senate floor. But as most Senate Republicans maintained their support for Ms. DeVos, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, scheduled a rare, early-morning procedural vote on her nomination to press ahead. Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, a former education secretary and chairman of the committee that approved Ms. DeVos in a party-line vote, said she would be \u201can excellent education secretary.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s committed to public education, and there\u2019s no better example of that than her work on the most important reform of public schools in the last 30 years: public charter schools,\u201d Mr. Alexander said. After gaveling in at 6:30 a.m. Friday, senators voted to limit further debate, setting the stage for a final confirmation vote this week. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, asked his colleagues to think about their vote over the weekend. \u201cSometimes loyalty to a president demands a bit too much,\u201d he said. On Monday, Senate Democrats said they would spend the final 24 hours before Ms. DeVos\u2019s confirmation vote speaking out against her on the floor in a last-ditch effort to woo Republicans to their side. But as the evening wore on, it looked increasingly likely that Ms. Collins and Ms. Murkowski would be the only Republican defectors, setting up a 50-50 tie. Vice President Mike Pence is expected to break the deadlock on Tuesday as president of the Senate, offering the 51st vote to confirm Ms. DeVos as education secretary.",

      "author": "Vanessa Friedman",
      "content": "   President-elect Donald J. Trump has reached into Western Michigan royalty to pick Betsy DeVos as his education secretary and is looking at Ben Carson to head the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Meantime, Hillary Clinton has widened her lead in the popular vote to 1.5 percentage points, a spread not seen for a losing candidate since the disputed election of 1876. Mr. Trump\u2019s choice of Betsy DeVos to be his education secretary brings Western Michigan royalty into the Trump fold, but she was not always a fan. Mrs. DeVos sharply criticized Mr. Trump during the campaign, and spent much of the year raising money for other Republicans on the ballot. \u201cUntil we have a better reason to embrace and support the top of the ticket, and see an agenda that is truly an opportunity agenda, then we have lots of other options in which to invest and spend our time helping,\u201d she said in May. The DeVos family, heirs to the Amway fortune, has long been a leading source of money for Republicans in Michigan and beyond. Just in the last three elections before 2016, members of the family gave nearly $9.5 million to party committees and candidates. Mrs. DeVos had money of her own before she married Richard DeVos Jr., the Amway scion. Her father, Edgar Prince, built his own auto parts supplier, in Holland, Mich. Her brother, Erik Prince, founded Blackwater USA, a private security contractor whose guards were convicted of killing 14 civilians in Baghdad in 2007. The National Education Association, the nation\u2019s largest teachers\u2019 union, was quick to voice its opposition to Ms. DeVos. With nominees chosen for C.I.A., national security adviser, secretary of education and ambassador to the United Nations, the next pick is expected to be the retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson to head the Department of Housing and Urban Development. That could be official as early as Friday. Mr. Trump posted on Twitter that he was \u201cseriously considering\u201d Mr. Carson, a former rival in the Republican primaries, as housing secretary. The department is no small corner of the government. Its programs fund public housing, subsidize rent for the poor, promote homeownership and work to revitalize struggling cities. And housing policy has been in a deep freeze since the Great Recession, when the nominally independent mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac collapsed and fell under federal control. For nearly a decade, the mortgage industry has basically been government run, with much of its profits going right into the Treasury. Mr. Carson would have a big role in figuring out how to move forward. Writing in the conservative Washington Times last year, Mr. Carson let it be known that he is no fan of government intervention in the housing market, specifically to force racial integration. With new votes tallied from New Jersey, Illinois, Maryland and California, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s popular vote lead reached 2,017,563 overnight, prompting new calls for an audit of voting machines in battleground states. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s lead now exceeds the winning percentages of seven presidents, five of whom also won the Electoral College. And it has given rise to a push from liberal activists to demand audits in three states won narrowly by Mr. Trump: Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. The University of Michigan computer scientist J. Alex Halderman posted an extensive explanation on Wednesday. Nate Cohn, who wrote of voter projections and analyzed polls for The New York Times, isn\u2019t buying it. Mainly, it would seem, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s record losing lead is pointing toward a structural disadvantage Democrats have with the Electoral College: Their voters are too concentrated in the bright blue states of the West Coast and Northeast. Democrats have now won the popular vote in six of the last seven presidential elections, but lost two of them (Al Gore in 2000, and Mrs. Clinton) in the Electoral College. After the hoo-ha created when Ivanka Trump Fine Jewelry started hawking a bracelet worn by Ms. Trump during a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d appearance as part of the new first family, Ivanka Trump-the-brand and Ivanka-Trump-the-woman are beginning to disengage. At least on Instagram, Facebook and elsewhere. On Monday, a public letter from Ivanka Trump HQ noted (in part): The separation follows another public letter from the designer Sophie Theallet announcing that she would refrain from dressing Melania Trump and encouraging her fellow designers to do the same. One more such open missive and we will have a new fashion trend. When Anthony Scaramucci, the hedge fund titan and Trump adviser, floated Elton John as an inauguration performer to The New York Post, the singer\u2019s response was swift: No way. He did, after all, say in October, \u201cWe need a humanitarian in the White House, not a barbarian.\u201d Pity. Mr. Scaramucci was counting on the diversity statement, telling The Post: President-elect Trump has chosen Gov. Nikki Haley of South Carolina, the daughter of Indian immigrants, to be his ambassador to the United Nations, the transition team announced Wednesday. Mr. Trump, whose presidential run was buoyed by an uncompromising stance against immigration, has mostly chosen older white men for cabinet posts in assembling his new team. Her move would eventually elevate South Carolina\u2019s lieutenant governor, Henry McMaster, an early and vocal supporter of Mr. Trump\u2019s. Ms. Haley backed Senator Marco Rubio of Florida during the primaries. Mr. Trump arrived on Tuesday night in Florida to celebrate Thanksgiving at his private club, Mar-a-Lago, in Palm Beach, a visit intended to give the president-elect some time with his family, and he isn\u2019t planning a packed schedule for Wednesday. But officials familiar with the transition process say that he will be busy deliberating his cabinet selections and may announce a domestic appointment before taking a quick break from work. The trip is the first time since Mr. Trump was elected president that he has visited his Florida club, which played host to a few primary night victory parties. President Obama will, for the last time, take part on Wednesday in one of our country\u2019s odder Thanksgiving traditions: the annual pardoning of the turkeys at the White House. Two turkeys, named Tater and Tot, will get the ritual absolution and move on to a nice home at Virginia Tech, even though only one of them will become the official national Thanksgiving turkey. It will be up to President Trump to do the honors \u2014 or not, should he choose otherwise \u2014 next year. Democrats will try to weigh in legislatively on Mr. Trump\u2019s business holdings next week. Senator Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland, the senior Democrat on the Foreign Affairs Committee, says he will introduce a \u201csense of Congress\u201d resolution stating that the new president should convert his substantial holdings in a way to avoid entanglements with foreign governments. If he does not do so, or unless Congress specifically authorizes his conduct, Mr. Trump would be considered in potential violation of the Constitution. The resolution is unlikely to see the light of day in the Republican-controlled Senate, but it will be part of what is expected to be a longer-term effort by Democrats to shine a light on the president-elect\u2019s business dealings. As Mrs. Clinton\u2019s lead in the popular vote grows, some of her most ardent supporters are clinging to hope that she could still win the election. A Change.org petition has garnered more than four million signatures urging Electoral College \u201celectors\u201d in some states to ignore the will of the voters and back Mrs. Clinton, reminding them that they could do so without any legal penalty. The electors will cast their ballots on Dec. 19. On Twitter, the hashtags #auditthevote and #audittheelection have become rallying cries for supporters of Mrs. Clinton who are directing people to flood the Justice Department with telephone calls about voting irregularities. The push is also taking place on Facebook, where calls are growing for a full investigation into Russia\u2019s role in the election. Even the sister of Huma Abedin, a top aide to Mrs. Clinton, weighed in, noting the tantalizingly slim margin that Mrs. Clinton would need to make up in three swing states \u2014 Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania \u2014 to come out on top in the Electoral College. \u201cThey are starting to recognize there really is something off about the election results as they come in,\u201d Heba Abedin wrote. \u201cConsidering everything that is at stake, a vote audit should be done.\u201d",

Trump\u2019s cabinet picks for the departments of Health and Human Services, Education and the Interior highlight a week of confirmation hearings.By Emmarie Huetteman and Kate ZernikePRINT EDITIONJanuary 18, 2017",
      "author": "Emmarie Huetteman",
      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 Betsy DeVos, President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s choice to lead the Education Department, was sharply criticized by Democrats on Tuesday evening in what was shaping up to be a contentious confirmation hearing. \u25a0 Republicans countered Democrats with rich praise for Ms. DeVos. \u25a0 Representative Ryan Zinke, Republican of Montana, Mr. Trump\u2019s choice for secretary of the Interior, had an easier time of it in his hearing on Tuesday. \u25a0 The main target of Democratic ire is likely to be Mr. Trump\u2019s choice to head the Department of Health and Human Services, Representative Tom Price, Republican of Georgia. His hearing Wednesday morning will focus on his strong opposition to the Affordable Care Act. Ms. DeVos, a billionaire philanthropist, has attracted opposition from organizations supporting charter schools and from teachers\u2019 unions. Her opening statement said that the public education system in the United States needed to move away from \u201ca one-size-fits-all model of learning,\u201d and toward one that would support parents who chose to send their children to private or religious schools, or to home school. \u201cToo many parents are denied access to the full range of options,\u201d she said. \u201cChoices that many of us \u2014 here in this room \u2014 have exercised for our own children.\u201d \u201cWhy, in 2017, are we still questioning parents\u2019 ability to exercise educational choice for their children?\u201d she asked. Ms. DeVos recalled her own education in a Christian school in Western Michigan, and her mother\u2019s job as a public-school teacher. She described a visit she and her husband, an heir to the Amway fortune, made to a Christian school in her hometown, Grand Rapids, Mich., as a turning point in her career as an advocate for school choice. \u201cWe saw the struggles and sacrifices many of these families faced when trying to choose the best educational option for their children,\u201d she said. \u201cFor me, this was not just an issue of public policy but of national injustice.\u201d She added: \u201cHere\u2019s the sad reality. In the past 28 years, the need and demand for these other options have grown, unabated.\u201d Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the ranking Democrat on the committee, said she was \u201cextremely disappointed\u201d that Ms. DeVos\u2019s hearing was proceeding before she had completed an agreement with the independent Office of Government Ethics that outlined a plan to deal with potential conflicts of interest. Mr. Zinke portrayed himself as an eager steward of the nation\u2019s public lands, treading a fine line between the importance of preservation and utilization as he testified before a Senate panel as Mr. Trump\u2019s choice for interior secretary. Mr. Zinke professed his admiration not only for the naturalist John Muir, a champion of preservation, but also for Gifford Pinchot, the first chief of the United States Forest Service. Mr. Pinchot pushed for what he described as the planned use and renewal of natural resources. \u201cIt is also these lands that many communities, like the town I grew up in, rely on to harvest timber, mine and to provide our nation with energy,\u201d he said in prepared remarks. He said one of his priorities leading the Interior Department would be addressing an estimated $12.5-billion backlog of maintenance and repairs in the national parks system. Mr. Zinke broke with Mr. Trump on the issue of climate change Tuesday, disagreeing with the president-elect\u2019s assertion at one point that it is \u201ca hoax.\u201d Mr. Zinke, who once said that climate change was \u201cnot proven science,\u201d said the climate was changing and that humans were having an impact on it. \u201cI think the debate is what that influence is, what we can do about it,\u201d Mr. Zinke said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it\u2019s a hoax,\u201d he added. He expressed his support for the president-elect\u2019s desire for energy independence, though, and he described his approach to developing energy resources on public lands as \u201call of the above.\u201d Mr. Zinke also drew a clear line on whether the federal government should keep control of its land. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely against transfer and sale of public lands,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t be more clear.\u201d Perhaps this week\u2019s most contentious confirmation hearing will Wednesday, when a Senate panel will take a look at Mr. Price, Mr. Trump\u2019s selection for secretary of Health and Human Services. Just days after congressional Republicans voted to move forward with plans to repeal President Obama\u2019s health care law, senators will question Mr. Price, one of the law\u2019s top critics in Congress. Republicans hope he can be an aggressive force within the administration as they work to repeal and replace the health care law. Democrats, who cannot block the repeal effort, will most likely take the opportunity to highlight their view that repealing the law will leave millions without health insurance. Watch for Democrats to attack Mr. Price\u2019s support for overhauling the Medicare system, an idea that would move away from its open-ended commitment to pay medical costs toward a plan where beneficiaries receive a fixed amount.",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 After contentious confirmation hearings, protests across the country and two rounds of voting, Betsy DeVos cleared the first hurdle in her path to becoming secretary of education on Tuesday with a party-line vote in the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions that advanced her nomination to the Senate floor. All 12 Republican senators on the committee voted for Ms. DeVos, a billionaire with a complex web of investments, including some in companies with connections to federal education policy. All 11 Democrats opposed her, calling her both dangerous and unqualified. The committee voted twice on Ms. DeVos\u2019s nomination after Democrats protested against a vote cast on behalf of Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, who was initially absent. Ms. DeVos\u2019s ultimate confirmation, while likely, is still not definite. Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, chairman of the committee, was visibly frustrated \u2014 by Democratic delaying tactics and arguments \u2014 as he defended Ms. DeVos and said she would be devoted not only to giving parents a choice about school options but also to protecting public schools. \u201cShe wants to reverse the trend of a national school board and stop telling teachers and school boards how to run their schools,\u201d Mr. Alexander said. \u201cOne would think the committee would be delighted with that. I respect my colleagues. I don\u2019t question their motives. I don\u2019t question their votes. But I believe their concerns are misplaced.\u201d But Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, expressed reservations about Ms. DeVos that sounded similar to those of Ms. DeVos\u2019s opponents. The senator said that while she would vote to advance Ms. DeVos out of committee, she would not commit to voting for her on the Senate floor. \u201cShe has not yet earned my full support,\u201d said Ms. Murkowski, who referred to conversations with Alaska teachers. \u201cBetsy DeVos must show all of us that she truly understands children of all America, of rural, of urban, who are not able to access an alternative choice in education.\u201d Democrats, teachers\u2019 unions and liberal protesters have been flooding senators with calls and emails protesting her nomination for myriad reasons. They have expressed concern about her family\u2019s contributions to groups that support so-called conversion therapy for gay people; her donations to Republicans and their causes, which she agreed have totaled about $200 million over the years; and her past statements that government \u201csucks\u201d and that public schools are a \u201cdead end.\u201d Opponents have focused on the poor performance of charter schools in Detroit, which she has bankrolled even as she resisted legislation that would have blocked chronically failing charter schools from expanding. Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the ranking Democrat on the committee, insisted she needed more time to question Ms. DeVos about possible conflicts of interests and about her dedication to ensuring the protection of public schools, which she eschewed for her own children. \u201cI have not been persuaded that Betsy DeVos will put students first if she were confirmed, and I have not been persuaded that she has the experience, skills, understanding, or vision to lead this critical department at a time when it is more important than ever,\u201d Ms. Murray said. \u201cFrom everything we heard, everything we know, and all of the questions that still remain, it is clear to me that Betsy DeVos is the wrong choice to lead our nation\u2019s Department of Education.\u201d",

      "author": "Erica L. Green",
      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 Dream Center Education Holdings, a subsidiary of a Los Angeles-based megachurch, had no experience in higher education when it petitioned the federal Education Department to let it take over a troubled chain of for-profit trade schools. But the organization\u2019s chairman, Randall K. Barton, told the education secretary, Betsy DeVos, that the foundation wanted to \u201chelp people live better lives.\u201d The purchase was blessed despite Dream Center\u2019s lack of experience and questionable finances by an administration favorable to for-profit education. But barely a year later, the company tumbled into insolvency, dozens of its colleges closed abruptly and thousands of students were left with no degree after paying tens of thousands of dollars in tuition. Making matters worse, the college is accused of enrolling new students and taking their taxpayer-supported financial aid dollars even after some of its campuses had lost their accreditation, which rendered their credits worthless. Company emails, documents and recordings show that part of why Dream Center kept going is that it thought the Education Department, which under Ms. DeVos has rolled back regulations on for-profit education, would try to keep it from failing. Mr. Barton emailed other Dream Center executives that the department\u2019s head of higher education policy \u2014 Diane Auer Jones, a former executive and lobbyist for for-profit colleges \u2014 had pulled strings to help the company\u2019s schools in their effort to regain a seal of approval from an accreditor, despite their perilous positions. In another instance, Dream Center\u2019s chief operating officer told faculty at an endangered campus that Ms. Jones was changing departmental regulations to help the schools obtain accreditation retroactively. Although the Trump administration did eventually cut off federal aid to the chain of colleges and precipitate their collapse, Democrats say the department failed to respond to warning signs. Representative Robert C. Scott, a Virginia Democrat who is the chairman of the House Education Committee, unveiled a trove of documents, including internal communication between executives from Dream Center, in a letter to Ms. DeVos this month. He said the documents suggest that Ms. Jones misled Congress about her efforts to help shield Dream Center from its misdeeds. \u201cThe actions of Dream Center and the Department of Education\u2019s execution of its responsibility to protect students raise grave concerns,\u201d Mr. Scott wrote. Instead of requiring Dream Center to take action, \u201cthe department informed Dream Center executives that it would work to retroactively accredit the institutions during the periods they had lied to students \u2014 rewriting history to erase Dream Center\u2019s deceptive marketing practices,\u201d Mr. Scott wrote. The Education Department has maintained it did nothing wrong. \u201cThis story is based entirely on a wrongful premise,\u201d the department wrote in a statement. \u201cThe full and complete timeline shows Dream Center did not receive any unique benefits from policy decisions made by the department. We simply worked to try and get as many students into a new program as possible. While we did not achieve a perfect outcome, our actions helped thousands of students land on their feet.\u201d In a response letter to Mr. Scott on Monday, the department\u2019s acting general counsel, Reed D. Rubinstein, submitted documentation that he said contradicted the committee\u2019s \u201cunfair suggestions\u201d that the department tailored its policies to assist Dream Center and was not forthcoming with Congress. \u201cThe Department categorically rejects these allegations,\u201d he wrote. \u201cDream Center\u2019s management received no special treatment,\u201d he said. President Trump has moved to deregulate any number of industries, from mining and offshore oil exploration to chemicals and internet providers. But Ms. DeVos\u2019s efforts to get the government off the backs of for-profit colleges have come under particular scrutiny, in part because of the spectacular implosions of for-profit college chains only a few years ago, in part because people who once worked in the sector have led the DeVos deregulatory push. Dream Center\u2019s collapse was the first of the new deregulatory era. Yet Education Department officials insisted, repeatedly, that its demise had nothing to do with the administration\u2019s policies or efforts. Ms. Jones told Congress that she did not even know of Dream Center\u2019s accreditation problems at the time the company said she was working to get it out of its jam. She also told lawmakers the policy change extending retroactive accreditation had \u201cnothing to do with the Dream Center.\u201d Those assurances are now being questioned. \u201cThe documents further suggest that department officials were not forthcoming to Congress and the public about the information they had about Dream Center\u2019s status and practices,\u201d Mr. Scott wrote. He is requesting emails, text messages and interviews with several department officials, including Ms. Jones. The letter and documents \u201craise questions about whether the department took steps to allow Dream Center to mislead students,\u201d Mr. Scott said. [Read the documents.] From the start, the Education Department overlooked red flags when, in late 2017, Dream Center took control of more than 100 campuses with 50,000 students from a for-profit higher-education company, Education Management Corporation. Around that time, Dream Center\u2019s accreditor, the Higher Learning Commission, notified the organization that it was about to change two of its schools\u2019 accreditation status. Two Education Department officials, including the agency\u2019s director of accreditation, were copied on the letter. In January 2018, the accreditor published a notification on its website stating that the two Dream Center schools were not accredited by the Higher Learning Commission. It ordered Dream Center to tell students that their courses and degrees \u201cmay not be accepted in transfer to other colleges and universities or recognized by prospective employers.\u201d Yet for five months, Dream Center kept advertising, \u201cWe remain accredited.\u201d By July 2018, Dream Center was running out of cash and knew its accreditation problems could worsen its financial strain. Emails from that month obtained by the House Education Committee indicate that Dream Center officials believed that the Education Department was maneuvering to help it stave off catastrophe. In written responses to questions from Congress, the Education Department said Ms. Jones was first made aware that the two Dream Center institutions were not accredited on July 10, 2018. She was unaware of the public notice that the Higher Learning Commission had issued nearly six months earlier, according to the agency. She was notified a week later that the institutions were misrepresenting their accreditation status and ordered them the next day to stop, the department said. Ms. Jones was asked during a House Oversight Committee hearing this spring whether a policy she had issued later that month that allowed accreditations to be granted retroactively was aimed at helping Dream Center. \u201cAbsolutely not. It had nothing to do with the Dream Center,\u201d she answered. But in company emails, Dream Center executives indicated the Education Department tipped them off on July 3, 2018, that a new retroactive accreditation policy was coming, a week before Ms. Jones said she even knew Dream Center had a problem. \u201cWe just got off the phone with DOE,\u201d Mr. Barton wrote. \u201cIt appears HLC is in sync with retro\u201d accreditation. He said Ms. Jones \u2014 whom he directly cited by name \u2014 had worked with accreditors, and \u201cthey will all agree to one plan with department blessing.\u201d Mr. Barton did not respond to requests for comment on his emails. On July 11, Dream Center\u2019s chief operating officer told faculty in a meeting on an Illinois campus that the department would allow the schools\u2019 accreditor to grant retroactive accreditation. He said department officials \u201cchanged their regulation to open the door to letting it happen,\u201d according to a recording of the meeting obtained by the committee. He referred to a conversation with Ms. Jones the week prior where \u201cshe said everybody was going to be accommodating.\u201d Weeks later, on July 25, Ms. Jones finalized the plan allowing retroactive accreditation, which was a major win for Dream Center. While the schools were already slated for closure, retroactive accreditation would have shielded the company from legal action for making misleading statements about its accreditation status. Ms. Jones said she had begun to revise that guidance months earlier to allay longstanding concerns about the department\u2019s policy stemming from a dispute involving an accreditor of a nursing program. The retroactive policy would have also allowed students to more easily transfer their credits if they were earned at an accredited institution. In response to Mr. Scott\u2019s accusations, Ms. Jones said, in a written statement to The New York Times, \u201cThe retroactive accreditation policy \u2014 which had been under discussion long before I arrived at the department \u2014 decided not whether Dream Center would live or die, but whether or not students could transfer their credits for the hard work they had completed.\u201d In August, after it became public that the two schools would close, Dream Center\u2019s head of regulatory and government affairs wrote an email to other Dream Center officials reminding them that communication should be kept confidential because \u201cDiane is really working behind the scenes to help guide us and keep the accreditors aligned.\u201d Ms. Jones did not directly address the July 3 and July 11 communication from Dream Center officials, but acknowledged that she had worked with accreditors. She called the Dream Center accreditation issue a \u201cmessy and complex situation\u201d and said the accreditor had sent mixed messages about the status of Dream Center\u2019s schools. Ms. Jones had acknowledged to Congress that she had concerns about the organization\u2019s capacity to manage its closures, and was in regular communication with a group of accreditors to devise a plan to allow Dream Center students to complete their degrees, known as a \u201cteach-out,\u201d after their campuses closed. \u201cMy goal was to get as many of the more than 8,000 students to new institutions where they could complete their programs,\u201d she said. \u201cI stand firm in my decision to work collaboratively with accreditors to hold Dream Center accountable. That Dream Center executives characterize this as being about them is disingenuous but not surprising. They were trying to make it appear they had control of the mess they had made.\u201d A group of students, represented by the National Student Legal Defense Network, filed a lawsuit last year, saying Dream Center issued \u201cfalse and misleading\u201d statements about its accreditation status, which broke state laws and caused \u201csubstantial harm\u201d to more than 1,000 students. Mr. Scott also pointed to emails documenting the steps the Education Department took to help Dream Center get hold of some much-needed cash to prop up its failing campuses. In an October 2018 email, Dream Center officials were preparing to request funding from an escrow account managed by the department. The funds were intended to offset taxpayer liabilities if some of the chain\u2019s schools closed or failed. Dream Center wanted to use part of the money to pay for expenses associated with closing campuses and helping current students complete their degrees. The department had in August agreed to release up to $50 million; Dream Center wanted more. Dennis Cariello, a Dream Center lawyer, sent an email to company executives before a meeting with A. Wayne Johnson, who headed the department\u2019s office of financial aid. At the meeting, Mr. Cariello planned to deliver a \u201clist of the asks\u201d that amounted to $75 million. Mr. Cariello communicated that Mr. Johnson \u201casked that I review the draw requests \u2014 there are a few we can\u2019t have in there \u2014 bonuses and future rental payments were issues for him.\u201d Mr. Cariello declined to comment on the exchange. The department had released a total of $40 million from the escrow account to Dream Center by the end of last year, according to records it sent in response to questions from Congress. Education Department officials have maintained that they worked tirelessly to mitigate the fallout of the Dream Center collapse. The department restricted the schools\u2019 cash flow from federal student loans after Dream Center went into receivership in January, barely a month before it cut off federal student loan funds to Argosy University. That final move was considered the death knell for the company. But until then, Dream Center executives had reason to believe they had friends at the Education Department. In January 2018, just as Dream Center\u2019s schools lost their accreditation, Ronald L. Holt, a regulatory lawyer on the Dream Center team, sent a presentation to Dream Center executives on the state of higher education a year into the Trump administration. It included a song he wrote titled, \u201cYou\u2019ve Got a Friend in Trump,\u201d to the tune of Randy Newman\u2019s \u201cYou\u2019ve Got a Friend in Me,\u201d used in the movie \u201cToy Story.\u201d",

      "author": "Erica L. Green",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Tens of thousands of students in California enrolled in online classes at out-of-state colleges abruptly lost federal financial aid this week after they found themselves in the cross-fire of a regulatory fight between Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and the nation\u2019s largest teachers\u2019 union. The students who lost their aid are the unlikely victims of an effort by the union, the National Education Association, to stop Ms. DeVos from delaying a rule written by the Obama administration to bolster consumer protections for students taking online courses at schools not based in their states. Ms. DeVos had warned that states were not ready to enforce the rules, and the teachers rebuffed those concerns. A judge sided with the union, leaving the students without aid. \u201cWe tried to delay the implementation of the 2016 rule because of its many flaws \u2014 including this consequence for California students,\u201d said Liz Hill, a spokeswoman for the department. \u201cUnfortunately, the N.E.A. filed a lawsuit, and a judge ruled that we have to implement the rule.\u201d The union accused the department of a vindictive maneuver to punish its members, regardless of the costs to students. \u201cThe Department of Education\u2019s determination to harm students, either through its incompetence or vindictiveness, is unacceptable,\u201d Lily Eskelsen Garc\u00eda, the president of the National Education Association, said in a statement. \u201cWe remain willing to help the department implement the protections in a way that does not jeopardize critical loans and Pell grants for students.\u201d The 2016 regulations, issued in the waning days of the Obama administration, sought to ensure that students taking such courses would not be left saddled with debt but gave no assurance that the courses would provide employment in the states in which they reside. The rules, part of a series of measures to challenge predatory for-profit colleges, also required schools to disclose whether their online programs were under investigation by the state attorney general or a college accreditor, and to set up a complaint system for students enrolled in out-of-state institutions. Ms. DeVos, acting on the concerns of higher education institutions, sought the delay, citing \u201cwidespread concern and confusion in the higher education community.\u201d The groups who had appealed to her for more time specifically warned of California\u2019s vulnerability because it had not set up a complaint system. But the teachers\u2019 unions did not buy it. They feared a delay would leave California teachers seeking online educational credits vulnerable to predatory attacks with no guarantee that their online programs would meet state standards for teacher certification. In August 2018, the National Education Association and the California Teachers Association sued Ms. DeVos, saying the department had not followed the proper administrative procedures in delaying the rules. They won. In April,  a Federal District Court judge in California ordered that the Obama rule go into effect. On Monday, the Education Department published a notification announcing that California was out of compliance with the rule and suspended financial aid to about 80,000 students in the state who were enrolled in \u201cdistance learning\u201d classes. And while the Obama-era rule was aimed at for-profit colleges that specialize in online offerings, the California students affected all attend private and public nonprofit institutions that are widely regarded as high-quality leaders in online learning, such as Arizona State and Western Governors universities. California students enrolled in online courses at for-profit colleges are covered by a state law. California officials indicated that the financial aid suspension could be short-lived. Russ Heimerich, a spokesman for the California Business, Consumer Services and Housing Agency, said that the agency had set up a complaint system that would meet the department\u2019s requirements. It will go live on Monday. Not leaving that to chance, the American Council on Education, an association representing more than 1,700 college presidents, sent a letter to the department on Thursday pressing for emergency action. Noting the imminent start of the academic school year, the organization said that its members were scrambling to help students who were already enrolled in classes, and had suddenly lost access to Pell grants and federal student loans. \u201cIn short, the likely outcome will be that thousands of students are either forced to drop out of, or never begin, postsecondary education,\u201d the group wrote. \u201cWe have already heard from several institutions that will do whatever they can to address any gaps in student funding that occur as a result, but this is at best a temporary solution.\u201d The American Council on Education was among those that first wrote to the department warning that the Obama-era rule could affect states, including California, that were not in full compliance. In anticipation of the rule\u2019s 2018 start date, every other state moved to create a complaint process or enter into multistate reciprocity agreements that would bring them into compliance with the rule. California did not. \u201cThis is a debate about obscure regulations, but one with immediate, real world consequences,\u201d said Terry W. Hartle, a senior vice president of the council. \u201cThe irony is that a lawsuit that was intended to protect students has had the unanticipated effect of taking money away from 80,000 students without any warning.\u201d",

GreenPRINT EDITIONL.G.B.T.Q. Students\u2019 Rights Cases Stall Under DeVos, Report Finds|July 30, 2019, Page A12",
      "author": "Erica L. Green",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Students who said they were discriminated against because of their sexual orientation or gender identity were significantly less likely to get any relief from the Education Department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights under the Trump administration than they were under the Obama administration, according to a report released Monday. The report, released by the liberal Center for American Progress and based on the Education Department\u2019s own data, provided the first analysis of how students who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or queer have fared in the first half of the Trump administration. The administration has reshaped policy to exclude civil rights protections for transgender people in most areas of government and has scaled back legal protections for gay people. The report found that the Trump administration was less likely to investigate claims of discrimination filed by the students \u2014 and more likely to dismiss them. The percentage of complaints that resulted in a school being required to take action to remedy the discrimination under the current administration was nine times lower than under the Obama administration, it concluded. In 2017, just weeks after the new administration took office, the Education and Justice Departments rescinded an Obama-era guidance document that informed schools that denying students access to bathrooms that correspond with their gender identity was a violation under Title IX, the federal law that prohibits sex discrimination in institutions that receive federal funding. The Trump administration believed, as many conservatives had long argued, that the Obama administration\u2019s guidance amounted to overreach and was inconsistent with federal law. The Education Department has adopted the administration\u2019s position, issued in a  memo by the Justice Department, that gender identity is not covered under federal civil rights laws. But Betsy DeVos, the education secretary, who reportedly protested the swiftness of the document\u2019s revocation, has said that while the department would no longer investigate bathroom complaints, it would still enforce protections for L.G.B.T.Q. students who were bullied, penalized or harassed for failing to conform to sex-based stereotypes. That is not happening, the Center for American Progress said. \u201cThese data really show that Betsy DeVos is not doing her job,\u201d said Frank J. Bewkes, one of the report\u2019s authors. \u201cHer office just doesn\u2019t seem to care about enforcing civil rights for these students.\u201d Education Department officials released data this month that showed that students who have filed civil rights complaints under Ms. DeVos\u2019s leadership were \u201cserved more efficiently and effectively than students who filed civil rights complaints during the previous administration.\u201d The agency boasted that it has resolved, on average, nearly double the number of civil rights complaints per year compared with the prior eight fiscal years, and it noted a 60 percent increase in the number of complaint resolutions that required schools to make changes to protect students\u2019 civil rights. The department said that its own analysis of the complaint data for L.G.B.T.Q. students showed the same trend. \u201cThese data were selectively compiled by a left-wing interest group to tell an ideological story,\u201d said Liz Hill, a spokeswoman for the department. \u201cNo one should mistake this as unbiased. This department vigorously protects the civil rights of all students and will continue to do so to the fullest extent of the law.\u201d The data obtained by the Center for American Progress, which has served as a research center for Democratic interests, reflected complaints filed by students from March 2010 to May 2018 and cases resolved by the Office for Civil Rights from November 2010 to June 2018. The organization examined complaints of discrimination based on gender identity, sexual orientation and sexual orientation-related sex stereotyping under Title IX, and determined how the complaints were handled using resolution codes used by the Education Department. An overwhelming number of complaints, 75.9 percent, alleged sexual or gender harassment, and transgender students were overrepresented in the filings. The Office for Civil Rights was at least 54 percent more likely to investigate a sexual orientation and gender identity complaint under the Obama administration than it was under the Trump administration, according to the report. When complaints were investigated, 91.5 percent were dismissed or closed with no finding of wrongdoing, compared with 65.4 percent under the Obama administration. Ultimately, the Obama administration resolved 22.4 percent of such cases with a change to policy or practice that the department believed would benefit the student, compared with 2.4 percent under the Trump administration, the group concluded. The Education Department said that its own analysis of the complaint categories showed that it was averaging more resolutions requiring schools to make a change than the previous administration \u2014 emphasizing the complaints acted on, not the complaints that went unanswered. It said the current administration averages 11 resolutions that required a change each year, compared with nine averaged under the Obama administration. In fiscal year 2018, the agency obtained more resolutions with change in these categories than the previous administration had achieved in any one year. Department officials acknowledged that the previous administration fared better when looking broadly at how all cases were resolved \u2014 which is what the Center for American Progress did \u2014 but noted that the previous administration\u2019s numbers appear better because it resolved fewer cases. \u201cA parent wants to know, if their child\u2019s civil rights are being violated, will O.C.R. provide for a change,\u201d Ms. Hill said, referring to the department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights. \u201cUnder this administration, it is more likely that it will. The numbers speak for themselves if assessed objectively.\u201d But critics say the department\u2019s metric for success ignores a large volume of students. \u201cIf you\u2019re just rushing through complaints, it\u2019s not surprising that you would resolve a large volume,\u201d said Shabab Ahmed Mirza, an author of the center\u2019s report. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve found is that more students are having cases resolved and not seeing justice. They\u2019re not talking about students who see no change at all.\u201d Ms. Mirza said that one finding in particular undercut the department\u2019s claim that the Obama administration\u2019s civil rights office was pushing a political agenda. Of the complaints that were investigated, the Obama administration was twice as likely to find after an investigation that a school had not violated students\u2019 rights. Catherine E. Lhamon, who led the Office for Civil Rights under the Obama administration and issued the transgender guidance, said that was because her administration was \u201cinvestigating the facts where they lead, and calling balls and strikes as they were.\u201d \u201cTo receive the signoff that you have not harmed children, it\u2019s a very significant resolution and it means a lot,\u201d Ms. Lhamon said. \u201cWhat the Trump administration is doing is not even examining whether anyone\u2019s been harmed. There\u2019s a benefit to examining whether a student has been discriminated against, even when the answer is no.\u201d",

      "content": " President Trump signed a measure on Wednesday that seeks to remove the bureaucratic barriers for permanently disabled veterans to qualify for student loan forgiveness, which he said would save 25,000 wounded warriors an average of $30,000. The rollout of the executive action came during the American Veterans national convention in Louisville, Ky., where Mr. Trump was joined onstage by Betsy DeVos, the education secretary, and the deputy secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs, James Byrne. \u201cI am proud to announce that I am taking executive action to ensure that our wounded warriors are not saddled with mountains of student debt,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThey have made a sacrifice that\u2019s so great. And they\u2019re such incredible people. And they never complain. They never complain. That\u2019s hundreds of millions of dollars in student debt held by our severely wounded warriors. It\u2019s gone forever.\u201d The savings projected by the Trump administration represents a small fraction of about $1.6 trillion in overall student loan debt in the United States, which has become a point of emphasis among many of the Democrats running for president. While 50,000 permanently disabled veterans in the country are eligible for relief under a decades-old debt forgiveness program, only half of them have qualified because of cumbersome requirements, according to the White House. The executive action signed by Mr. Trump directs the Education Department and the Department of Veterans Affairs to simplify the process to speed up applications. The president said disabled veterans would not have to pay federal income tax on the forgiven debt, and he called on all 50 states to provide the same relief. \u201cSo that\u2019s really big stuff,\u201d Mr. Trump said. Some of the administration\u2019s critics, however, have said that Ms. DeVos has hindered the process. In  a letter sent to Ms. DeVos in May, the attorneys general for 53 states and territories said that the Education Department was not doing enough to help ease the burden of college debt for disabled veterans and that the Education Department was too hung up on the tax implications of forgiving student loan debt. \u201cAs a nation, we have a moral obligation to assist those who have put their lives on the line to defend us,\u201d the group wrote.

GreenPRINT EDITIONRecord Fine for Michigan St. in Nassar Case|September 6, 2019, Page A13",
      "author": "Erica L. Green",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Michigan State University agreed to pay a record $4.5 million federal fine and the university\u2019s provost resigned on Thursday after the Education Department determined that the school failed to report and address claims of sexual abuse by a former team doctor, Lawrence G. Nassar, who was convicted of sex crimes. The fine was part of a settlement with the department, which initiated two investigations into the university\u2019s handling of abuse by Mr. Nassar and the complicity of William Strampel, a former dean of the university\u2019s College of Osteopathic Medicine. Mr. Nassar, a former doctor for the American women\u2019s gymnastics team, was also an associate professor at the school. The investigations revealed what department officials called \u201csystemic failure to protect students from sexual abuse\u201d over decades, and the university is now obligated to make sweeping changes to its campus safety operations. \u201cWhat transpired at Michigan State was abhorrent, inexcusable, and a total and complete failure to follow the law and protect students,\u201d Education Secretary Betsy DeVos said in a statement. \u201cMichigan State will now pay for its failures.\u201d The president of Michigan State University, Samuel L. Stanley Jr., pledged immediate action. Among the first was accepting the resignation of June Youatt, the school\u2019s provost, effective immediately. Mr. Stanley said in a statement that the findings of the department made it clear that the provost and the university\u2019s former president failed to take appropriate action to address inappropriate behavior, specifically that of Mr. Strampel. Lou Anna K. Simon, who served as president during the years that Dr. Nassar abused girls and young women, resigned from the post last year and is facing state and federal charges. Mr. Strampel, who was also Mr. Nassar\u2019s supervisor, is serving a year in jail for neglecting to address the abuse. Mr. Nassar was sentenced to 40 to 175 years  in prison for multiple sex crimes. \u201cIn my effort to build a safe and caring campus, we must have a culture of accountability,\u201d said Mr. Stanley, who took his post on Aug. 1. Mr. Stanley also announced a newly formed oversight committee that will be responsible for ensuring that the university fulfills the requirements outlined in settlement agreements with the department. \u201cThe agreements with U.S. Department of Education further remind us that we failed survivors and our community,\u201d he said. The fine, though dwarfed by the university\u2019s $500 million civil settlement with sexually abused young women, was the largest ever levied under the Clery Act, a federal law that requires colleges to disclose campus crime statistics and issue prompt safety alerts. It far exceeded the $2.4 million penalty levied by the Obama administration  on Penn State University in the wake of the Jerry Sandusky scandal. John Manly, a lawyer for many of the 332 women who sued the university over abuse by Mr. Nassar, called the $4.5 million fine \u201cincredibly insufficient.\u201d \u201cThis week the U.S. government fined YouTube $170 million for improperly monitoring children\u2019s web activity, and days later that same government fines a $20-plus-billion-dollar institution a mere $4.5 million for knowingly allowing a voracious sexual predator to molest 500-plus women and girls,\u201d he said. \u201cSadly, it\u2019s obvious that the political leadership of the Department of Education doesn\u2019t give a damn about stopping this type of behavior at America\u2019s colleges.\u201d Others said that the department\u2019s method of calculating Clery Act fines had always been opaque, so it seemed proper to judge this one by the historical context. \u201cYou have to put it in perspective with other Department of Education fines,\u201d said Brett A. Sokolow, the president of the Association of Title IX Administrators, which polices sexual misconduct on campuses. \u201cIt\u2019s the largest in history. So while it\u2019s a relatively small number, it is in context the most egregious violation there\u2019s ever been.\u201d The department\u2019s federal student aid office found a number of violations of the law, including a failure to properly record and report crime statistics, issue timely warnings to students and staff about episodes that posed threats, and a failure to notify campus security of complaints. \u201cWhile the fine is important, of greatest importance to us is the long-term safety of every student,\u201d said Mark A. Brown, the chief operating officer of the Education Department, who oversaw the student aid office. The Clery investigation, which began in January 2018, found that complaints against Mr. Nassar, including some dating back decades, were omitted from the university\u2019s crime statistics. For example, in 1997, a 16-year-old, identified as \u201cSurvivor A,\u201d made a report that should have been marked as a forcible sex offense under the Clery Act, but there was no record of it. The university also should have taken other measures required under the law, such as notifying students and staff members of Mr. Nassar\u2019s continuing pattern of abuse, investigators said. In a settlement agreement with the department\u2019s federal student aid office, the university said it would establish a Clery compliance officer position and a committee to oversee its compliance efforts and strengthen its reporting system. Department officials said they would \u201cvigorously monitor\u201d the university\u2019s compliance through September 2024. Separately, Ms. DeVos had ordered the Education Department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights to investigate whether the university met its obligations under Title IX, the federal civil rights law that requires schools to address sexual assaults on campus. The university had already been under government oversight as part of a  2015 resolution agreement resulting from a 2014 Title IX complaint. Over the 19-month civil rights investigation, the office reviewed hundreds of sexual assault reports, interviewed 47 witnesses and victims, and read tens of thousands of documents. That investigation found that university officials did not adequately respond to complaints against Mr. Nassar and Mr. Strampel, had subjected students to a sexually hostile environment, and had repeatedly failed to take appropriate and prompt action when notified of complaints. \u201cToo many people in power knew about the behaviors and the complaints, and yet the predators continued on the payroll and abused even more students,\u201d Ms. DeVos said. The civil rights investigation concluded that the university\u2019s egregious Title IX violations were largely the result of university officials not taking complaints seriously. \u201cThe university\u2019s inaction in response to so many complaints about the dean over so many years very likely perpetuated the belief expressed by many that they had no choice but to tolerate the dean\u2019s behavior,\u201d the report said, referring to Mr. Strampel. For instance, the report described numerous complaints referring to the dean\u2019s \u201congoing alleged sexually harassing.\u201d A school provost hosted an informal meeting about a complaint against Mr. Strampel, but the only record of it was a \u201cone-sentence email summary to the vice president for human resources, punctuated with a smiley-face emoji, a response which betrays her failure to appreciate the seriousness of the matter,\u201d the report said. \u201cFor nearly 14 years the dean\u2019s conduct continued unchecked \u2014 if not enabled \u2014 by the failure of administrators at the highest levels of the University to take appropriate actions to address it,\u201d civil rights investigators said. In the resolution agreement, the civil rights office ordered the university to review the actions of current and former employees, who could still face disciplinary actions. The university is also required to hire an independent consultant to conduct an assessment of its Title IX grievance procedures and completely overhaul them. It also requires that the school establish a process to extend remedies to Mr. Nassar\u2019s victims, like counseling services, grade adjustments and tuition reimbursement. \u201cWhile this agreement applies directly to only one specific university, we expect that this message should be heard loudly and clearly at all universities so that the tragedy at M.S.U. is not repeated elsewhere,\u201d said Kenneth L. Marcus, assistant secretary for civil rights at the Education Department.",

GreenPRINT EDITIONU.S. Demands Colleges Recast Mideast Focus|September 20, 2019, Page A1",
      "author": "Erica L. Green",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 The Education Department has ordered Duke University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to remake the Middle East studies program run jointly by the two schools after concluding that it was offering students a biased curriculum that, among other complaints, did not present enough \u201cpositive\u201d imagery of Judaism and Christianity in the region. In a rare instance of federal intervention in college course content, the department asserted that the universities\u2019 Middle East program violated the standards of a federal program that awards funding to international studies and foreign language programs. The inquiry was part of a far-reaching investigation into the program by the department, which under Betsy DeVos, the education secretary, has become increasingly aggressive in going after perceived anti-Israel bias in higher education. That focus appears to reflect the views of an agency leadership that includes a civil rights chief, Kenneth L. Marcus, who has made a career of pro-Israel advocacy and has waged a yearslong campaign to delegitimize and defund Middle East studies programs that he has criticized as rife with anti-Israel bias. In this case, the department homed in on what officials saw as a program that focused on the region\u2019s Muslim population at the expense of its religious minorities. In the North Carolina program\u2019s outreach to elementary and secondary school students, the department said, there was \u201ca considerable emphasis placed on the understanding the positive aspects of Islam, while there is an absolute absence of any similar focus on the positive aspects of Christianity, Judaism or any other religion or belief system in the Middle East.\u201d Too few of the Duke-U.N.C. programs focused on \u201cthe historic discrimination faced by, and current circumstances of, religious minorities in the Middle East, including Christians, Jews, Baha\u2019is, Yazidis, Kurds, Druze and others,\u201d the department said. With its actions, the department entered the debate over Israel and Palestinians that has roiled campuses around the country. The department\u2019s action \u201cshould be a wake-up call,\u201d said Miriam Elman, an associate professor at Syracuse University and the executive director of the Academic Engagement Network, which opposes the boycott-Israel movement that has animated campus activism across the country. She added, \u201cWhat they\u2019re saying is, \u2018If you want to be biased and show an unbalanced view of the Middle East, you can do that, but you\u2019re not going to get federal and taxpayer money.\u2019\u201d Palestinian rights groups accused the Education Department of intimidation and infringing on academic freedom. \u201cThey really want to send the message that if you want to criticize Israel, then the federal government is going to look very closely at your entire program and micromanage it to death,\u201d said Zoha Khalili, a staff lawyer at Palestine Legal, one such group. The department\u2019s intervention, she added, \u201csends a message to Middle Eastern studies programs that their continued existence depends on their willingness to toe the government line on Israel.\u201d In a letter to university officials, the assistant secretary for postsecondary education, Robert King, wrote that programs run by the Duke-U.N.C. Consortium for Middle East Studies appeared to be misaligned with the federal grant they had received. Title VI of the Higher Education Act awards funding to colleges \u201cestablishing, strengthening and operating a diverse network of undergraduate foreign language and area or international studies centers and programs.\u201d The Education Department \u201cbelieves\u201d the Middle Eastern studies consortium \u201chas failed to carefully distinguish between activities lawfully funded under Title VI and other activities\u201d that are \u201cplainly unqualified for taxpayer support,\u201d Mr. King wrote. The letter, published this week in the Federal Register, said that the consortium\u2019s records on the number of students it had enrolled in foreign language studies \u2014 a cornerstone of the federal grant program \u2014 were unclear, and that \u201cit seems clear foreign language instruction and area studies advancing the security and economic stability of the United States have taken \u2018a back seat\u2019 to other priorities.\u201d Mr. King wrote that the department believed other offerings, like a conference focused on \u201clove and desire in modern Iran\u201d and another focused on Middle East film criticism, \u201chave little or no relevance to Title VI.\u201d The department wrote the consortium\u2019s programming also \u201cappears to lack balance.\u201d The department also criticized the consortium\u2019s teacher training programs for focusing on issues like \u201cunconscious bias, serving L.G.B.T.I.Q. youth in schools, culture and the media, diverse books for the classroom and more.\u201d They said that it had a \u201cstartling lack of focus on geography, geopolitical issues, history and language.\u201d The administration ordered the consortium to submit a revised schedule of events it planned to support and a full list of the courses it offers and the professors working in its Middle East studies program. The department also directed the consortium to demonstrate that it had \u201ceffective institutional controls\u201d to stay compliant with the administration\u2019s interpretation of the Higher Education Act. The universities were given until Sept. 22, only days before the department is scheduled to approve funding on Sept. 30. A spokesman for Duke declined to comment, referring questions to the University of North Carolina. A spokeswoman for the U.N.C. acknowledged receipt of the letter. \u201cThe consortium deeply values its partnership with the Department of Education and has always been strongly committed to complying with the purposes and requirements of the Title VI program,\u201d the university said in a statement. \u201cIn keeping with the spirit of this partnership, the consortium is committed to working with the department to provide more information about its programs.\u201d To advocacy groups enmeshed in academic battles over Israel, the new investigation was not surprising. Last year, the department reopened a case into anti-Jewish bias at Rutgers University that the Obama administration had closed with no finding of wrongdoing. In reconsidering the case, Mr. Marcus said the Education Department would be using a State Department definition of anti-Semitism that, among other things, labels \u201cdenying the Jewish people their right to self-determination\u201d anti-Jewish bigotry, suggesting that it had been adopted by his office. The Education Department has not adopted that definition. In June, Ms. DeVos said she had ordered an investigation into whether the Duke-U.N.C. consortium had misused any of the $235,000 it received in Title VI grants, including to sponsor an event in March called \u201cConflict Over Gaza: People, Politics and Possibilities.\u201d Representative George Holding, Republican of North Carolina, had requested that Ms. DeVos investigate whether federal funding was used to host the conference, which constituents had said was rife with \u201cradical anti-Israel bias.\u201d Mr. Holding said the conference featured active members of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement against Israel \u2014 known as B.D.S. \u2014 and featured panelists who \u201cdistorted facts and misrepresented the complex situation in Gaza.\u201d He said a video shown at the conference featured a performer who sang a \u201cbrazenly anti-Semitic song.\u201d But some groups came to the defense of the Middle East studies consortium. Tallie Ben Daniel, the research and education manager at Jewish Voice for Peace, a liberal group that advocates Palestinian rights, said the investigation was the latest attempt by the Trump administration \u201cto enforce a neoconservative agenda onto spaces of academic inquiry and exploration.\u201d She called the consortium\u2019s curriculum \u201crich and diverse.\u201d To critics like Ms. Daniel, the targeting of the U.N.C.-Duke program appeared to be a continuation of efforts that predated the Trump administration. A group founded by Mr. Marcus, the Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law, has pressed Education Department and Congress for years to crack down on Middle East studies programs that the center claimed promoted an anti-Israel bias. But Ms. Elman, the professor at Syracuse, said the department\u2019s scrutiny of the programs was long overdue. \u201cTo get Title VI, you really have to strive for viewpoint diversity,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is what our students want. They don\u2019t want to be indoctrinated. They want both sides. It\u2019s possible to do that and still make people uncomfortable.\u201d Before joining the Education Department, Mr. Marcus had aggressively lobbied for the Higher Education Act to crack down on Middle East studies programs, and criticized both the Education Department and Congress for failing to hold institutions accountable for violating the law\u2019s \u201cdiverse perspectives\u201d requirement. In 2014, he wrote an opinion article that assailed the Title VI program for \u201cbeing used to support biased and academically worthless programming on college campuses,\u201d leaving students and faculty with opposing views \u201costracized and threatened.\u201d \u201cAside from their intellectual vapidity,\u201d Mr. Marcus wrote, \u201cmany of these programs poison the atmosphere on campus.\u201d He called on the department to establish a complaint process that would prompt extensive reviews of entire programs like the one being undertaken into U.N.C. and Duke.",

      "author": "Erica L. Green",
      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014  America\u2019s fourth and eighth graders are losing ground in their ability to read literature and academic texts, according to a rigorous national assessment released Wednesday that is likely to fuel concerns over student achievement after decades of tumult on the educational landscape. Two out of three children did not meet the standards for reading proficiency set by the National Assessment of Educational Progress, a test administered by the National Center for Education Statistics, the research arm of the Education Department. The dismal results reflected the performance of about 600,000 students in reading and math, whose scores made up what is called the \u201cnation\u2019s report card.\u201d The average eighth-grade reading score declined in more than half of the states compared with 2017, the last time the test was given. The average score in fourth-grade reading declined in 17 states. Math scores remained relatively flat in most states. Only 35 percent of fourth graders were proficient in reading in 2019, down from 37 percent in 2017; 34 percent of eighth graders were proficient in reading, down from 36 percent. Overall student progress in reading has stalled in the last decade, with the highest performers stagnating and the lowest-achieving students falling further behind. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos on Wednesday called it a \u201cstudent achievement crisis.\u201d \u201cThink about the mom or dad who cannot read, and so does not read to their own children at bedtime,\u201d Ms. DeVos said as she released the scores. \u201cThink about what that portends for their lifelong learning.\u201d Ms. DeVos dismissed calls \u2014 including those from Democratic presidential candidates \u2014 to increase school funding to improve the worst-performing schools. She has championed programs that allow tax dollars to follow children to the schools of their choice, including private schools, religious schools and charter schools, and has rejected the view that more money would lift struggling schools. Representative Rosa DeLauro, Democrat of Connecticut and chairwoman of the House subcommittee that oversees the Education Department\u2019s budget, sharply disagreed. Rather than \u201cexploiting\u201d the result of the test \u201cto spread lies and promote her privatization agenda, Secretary DeVos should join House Democrats and families across our nation by supporting increased investments in our public education system,\u201d she said. School-district leaders and education advocates said the steep losses among the lowest-performing students reflected structural barriers beyond schoolhouses. \u201cThis is a disturbing pattern, one that is consistent with our nation\u2019s growing economic inequality and history of structural discrimination in education, housing, and access to opportunity,\u201d said Mike Magee, the chief executive of Chiefs for Change, which represents state and district education leaders. A growing body of research indicates that reading instruction is uneven across the country and often ineffective. Peter Afflerbach, an expert on reading and testing at the University of Maryland, called the eighth-grade declines \u201ctroubling\u201d and \u201cprecipitous,\u201d especially for the lowest-achieving students. Eighth graders at the bottom 10 percent of reading achievement lost six points on the exam compared with similar students two years ago, while students at the middle lost three points. Students in the top 10 percent lost only one point. White, black, Hispanic, Native American and multiracial students all lost ground in eighth-grade reading, while there was no significant change for Asian students. Eighth grade is crucial because it prepares students for high school and beyond. The most recent research on reading, Mr. Afflerbach said, has undermined a long-held view that children learn to read until the fourth grade, and then \u201cread to learn\u201d in higher grades. Because of that view, too many schools have assigned elementary students short passages instead of challenging them with longer, thematically rich texts and books. The new eighth-grade results show \u201cthe students haven\u2019t developed the reading comprehension to deal with text complexity,\u201d he said. Washington, D.C., was the only city or state to have significant improvement in eighth-grade reading, according to a federal analysis of the data. The District of Columbia Public Schools was the fastest-improving of 27 urban systems that participated in a separate analysis of large districts. It also demonstrated growth in fourth- and eighth-grade math. Lewis D. Ferebee, the chancellor of the District of Columbia Public Schools, attributed the gains to a broad range of policies, including universal preschool, higher pay and performance bonuses for teachers, and home visits to help educators understand their students\u2019 family contexts. He also talked about \u201ccornerstones\u201d \u2014 the district\u2019s effort to teach vocabulary and reading skills through shared experiences. Elementary students take lessons in how to safely ride a bike, and go on a field trip to Nationals Park, the city\u2019s professional baseball stadium, where they run the bases. \u201cWhile that sounds super fun, embedded in that experience is a very rich literacy lesson,\u201d Mr. Ferebee said. He acknowledged, however, that the system still had work to do, especially in closing income-based achievement gaps. Catherine Snow, a literacy expert at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, said educators need to learn how to integrate foundational reading skills, such as knowledge of letter sounds and combinations, into lessons that will excite young children. \u201cIf the task you\u2019re engaged in is researching lizards\u2019 reproductive cycle or discussing who Harry Potter\u2019s best friend was and why, those are intrinsically motivating tasks,\u201d Ms. Snow said. \u201cThey drive you back to texts to find information.\u201d This year, eighth-grade reading scores in 31 states dropped two to seven points  \u2014 which the federal government deemed significant \u2014 compared with their performances in 2017. Indiana, New Hampshire and Virginia had the largest declines. Fourth-grade reading scores dropped in 17 states, with New Jersey\u2019s six-point drop the largest. Only one state, Mississippi, improved, the data showed. James F. Lane, the superintendent of public instruction in Virginia, said that while grade-level proficiency was a goal, the school system \u201cmust also recognize that Virginia\u2019s schools are enrolling increasing numbers of students whose learning is impacted by poverty and trauma.\u201d He said the school system needed to recruit and retain high-quality teachers and equip them to meet the needs of a \u201cchanging student population.\u201d Average math scores fared considerably better, particularly among fourth graders. Nine states had significant increases in fourth-grade math, compared with 2017. Again, Mississippi led the pack. The eighth-grade score in three states improved, while those in six states declined. American students have made large gains in math and small gains in reading since 1990. But those improvements began to level out around 2009. There is no consensus on why that happened. The Council of the Great City Schools, a coalition of large urban school systems, said it saw a hopeful story in the new data. Over the past two decades, city students, who are more likely to be poor or not fluent in English, have moved closer to national achievement averages in both math and reading. Some researchers consider the National Assessment of Educational Progress test to be the gold-standard measure of learning nationwide, but others argue it is unfair to judge schools using an exam that may have little connection to the material teachers cover in the classroom. In many cases, the federal exam is more challenging than state-level standardized tests. \u201cSomeone has got to hold states accountable,\u201d said Jim Cowen, the executive director of the Collaborative for Student Success, a group that defends the roles of standards and testing in public schools.",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 A judicial nominee slated for a key Senate committee vote on Thursday helped devise an illegal Education Department effort to use private Social Security data to deny debt relief to thousands of students cheated by their for-profit colleges, according to a memo obtained by The New York Times. The plan, outlined by Steven J. Menashi when he was acting general counsel under Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, was ruled by a federal judge to violate federal privacy laws. She ordered the department to stop the practice. In the memo, President Trump\u2019s appeals court nominee, who left the Education Department to join the White House legal team, outlined the department\u2019s plan to use earnings data from the Social Security Administration to forgive only a small percentage of debts shouldered by 30,000 borrowers who attended Corinthian Colleges, a for-profit chain that the Obama administration found misled thousands of students. Corinthian\u2019s collapse left its students and graduates with worthless degrees and mountains of debt. In the previously unreported memo, Mr. Menashi wrote that Ms. DeVos had the discretion to determine how to respond to requests for relief, then boasted that the department had used Social Security income data: \u201cThe department utilized actual earnings data for borrowers maintained by the Social Security Administration.\u201d He also said her method was not subject to judicial review. That proved untrue: Six months after a new partial-forgiveness policy was implemented, Magistrate Judge Sallie Kim of Federal District Court in San Francisco ruled that using the Social Security data violated the federal Privacy Act. Since then, the department has been entangled in a messy court battle, which recently resulted in Ms. DeVos being held in contempt of court and facing a $100,000 fine. The fight has now become part of a broad effort to thwart Mr. Menashi\u2019s confirmation to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Eileen Connor, the legal director at Harvard\u2019s Project on Predatory Student Lending, the group representing Corinthian students in the lawsuit, warned that \u201cputting Menashi on the bench will be seen by government agencies as a green light to put their agenda above the rights of everyday Americans, and above the rule of law.\u201d \u201cAs we\u2019ve seen time and time again, the only way for students to get a fair shake is not from the Department of Education, it\u2019s through the courts,\u201d she said. \u201cMenashi has shown that in his view there is no role for the federal courts in reviewing, much less checking, executive action. This is a dangerous perspective for someone who could potentially hold a lifelong appointment to the federal appeals court.\u201d The White House did not respond to a request for comment. The memo sheds light on the role that Mr. Menashi played in creating one of the Education Department\u2019s most embattled policies, which has made it significantly harder for people to seek student loan forgiveness. The memo, in which Mr. Menashi outlined the legal bases for the new loan forgiveness calculation resting \u201con substantial evidence of the harm to borrowers,\u201d informed a high-ranking official in the department\u2019s student aid office that it superseded legal interpretation by the Obama administration. In response to questions during his confirmation process, Mr. Menashi has maintained that he was involved in \u201call aspects\u201d of the department\u2019s operations, but in a hearing in September, he declined to answer specific questions about his efforts, prompting criticism from both Democrats and Republicans. At least one Republican senator, Susan Collins of Maine, said she would oppose Mr. Menashi\u2019s confirmation, in part, because of his reluctance to answer questions about the specific policies he has influenced. Other key Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee, such as Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana, also expressed reservations. Mr. Menashi, a former law clerk to Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. at the Supreme Court, has also drawn criticism for past writings on issues affecting the gay community, women and other minorities. Mr. Menashi has expressed regret about the writings. But critics have also raised concerns about his role in rolling back students\u2019 civil rights protections at the Education Department, where he was instrumental in overhauling regulations that govern how schools and colleges respond to complaints of sexual assault. Last month, Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, sent a letter questioning Mr. Menashi about whether he helped Ms. DeVos \u201cundermine protections\u201d for student borrowers. She noted that his tenure overlapped with the lawsuit challenging the partial-forgiveness policy. \u201cI am concerned in light of your troubling record of working with Secretary DeVos to undermine protections for students who were cheated and defrauded by for-profit colleges,\u201d Ms. Murray wrote. The 11-page memo is dated Dec. 14, 2017, about a week before Ms. DeVos announced a new system for calculating loan forgiveness, using \u201caverage earnings\u201d after college to determine whether Corinthian students suffered long-term economic harm. She said the new system would allow \u201charmed students to be treated fairly,\u201d while protecting \u201ctaxpayers from being forced to shoulder massive costs that may be unjustified.\u201d The department halted use of the data after Judge Kim\u2019s ruling. It had obtained the data from the Social Security Administration to implement another Obama-era regulation intended to force for-profit colleges to show that their degrees would lead to gainful employment. In his memo, Mr. Menashi wrote that data obtained to hold for-profit colleges accountable could be repurposed to scrutinize their students. Mr. Menashi argued that the department was in a \u201cunique position\u201d to examine whether students had gone on to earn the salaries of other students in similar programs. He said a comparison of Corinthian students\u2019 earnings determined that the schools \u201cprovided measurable value to students.\u201d Corinthian students argued that the department should not have been using the data for anything but the purpose it was requested for, and the judge agreed. Advocates for the students said the department\u2019s consideration of whether students went on to do well despite being lied to by their colleges was not relevant, nor was it relevant that some obtained jobs that had nothing to do with what they had trained for. But Mr. Menashi\u2019s legal advice found a willing audience: Ms. DeVos has been clear that she did not want to grant full relief to students who claimed they were defrauded by colleges. She criticized the Obama administration\u2019s approach as \u201cfree money.\u201d In a 2017 memo, unveiled in court filings, Ms. DeVos signed off on discharging the loans of 16,000 Corinthian students whose applications were approved under the Obama administration, but took the liberty of writing a message in the comments section of the form: \u201cWith extreme displeasure.\u201d",

      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 A federal judge on Thursday fined Education Secretary Betsy DeVos for contempt of court, ruling that she had violated an order to stop collecting on loans owed by students from a now-defunct for-profit chain of colleges. Magistrate Judge Sallie Kim of the Federal District Court in San Francisco ordered the Education Department to pay a $100,000 fine. The money will go toward various remedies for students who are owed debt relief after President Barack Obama\u2019s Education Department found they were defrauded by the chain, Corinthian Colleges, which collapsed in 2014. The ruling is a victory for the more than 60,000 students who have been on a financial roller coaster since Corinthian imploded, after state and federal officials found that it lured students through deceptive recruitment practices and falsified job placement rates. The decision stems from a class-action lawsuit filed in 2017 by the Project on Predatory Student Lending of the Legal Services Center of Harvard Law School and the group Housing and Economic Rights Advocates, both of which represent former Corinthian students. For more than a year, the students\u2019 lawyers argued that Ms. DeVos had illegally punished thousands of cheated students who were owed relief from the federal government. Toby Merrill, director of the project, said that the ruling demonstrated \u201cthe extreme harm\u201d of Ms. DeVos\u2019s actions. \u201cSecretary DeVos has repeatedly and brazenly violated the law to collect for-profit college students\u2019 debts and deny their rights, and today she has been held accountable,\u201d she said. In a video statement posted on Twitter, Mark Brown, chief operating officer of the Education Department\u2019s Federal Student Aid office, said that loan servicers had \u201cmistakenly\u201d billed about 16,000 students and parents. \u201cAlthough these actions were not done with ill intent, students and parents were affected and we take full responsibility for that,\u201d Mr. Brown said. He said the department had taken swift action to respond, including refunding nearly all payments that borrowers should not have had to make, returning tax refunds and wages that were seized, and updating credit reports for affected students and parents. He said the department had also formally reprimanded loan servicers that collected debts, and initiated personnel action against Education Department employees who failed in their oversight roles. In 2015, Arne Duncan, the education secretary at the time, announced that the department would use a provision known as \u201cborrower defense to repayment\u201d to forgive the federal student debts of Corthinian\u2019s students. \u201cYou\u2019d have to be made of stone not to feel for these students,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is our first major action on this but obviously it won\u2019t be the last.\u201d But the department moved slowly to establish a formal process for discharging the students\u2019 debts, and by the time Mr. Obama left office, only 12,000 Corinthian students had their ledgers wiped clean. Tens of thousands more awaited relief. Instead of fully eliminating those students\u2019 debts, however, Ms. DeVos instituted a new system for borrower defense claims that granted little to no debt forgiveness if those students were found to have earned a livable wage. The Project on Predatory Student Lending filed a lawsuit challenging that system. Last year, Magistrate Judge Kim found the system illegal, ruling that the Education Department had violated borrowers\u2019 privacy by obtaining and misusing their earnings data from the Social Security Administration. She issued an injunction ordering the department to stop using the data and collecting the debts of Corinthian students. The department appealed the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and is waiting for a ruling. But the department, through the outside student loan servicers that it pays to handle borrowers\u2019 accounts, kept pursuing the debts and even garnished some students\u2019 tax refunds and wages. The department\u2019s loan servicers sent at least 16,000 Corinthian borrowers bills for payments they did not actually owe. The students\u2019 lawyers asked the court to halt those collections and punish the department for its actions. In a response to scathing criticism from Senator Elizabeth Warren over her handling of the debt collection, Ms. DeVos wrote on Twitter this month: \u201cLoan servicers made an error on a small # of loans. We know & we\u2019re fixing it.\u201d Magistrate Judge Kim made it clear this month that she believed the department had acted badly. \u201cI\u2019m astounded, really,\u201d she said during a fiery hearing. \u201cI feel like there have to be some consequences for the violation of my order 16,000 times.\u201d In her ruling on Thursday, Magistrate Judge Kim wrote that the department had made \u201conly minimal efforts to comply\u201d with her order, and that it had \u201charmed individual borrowers who were forced to repay loans.\u201d She also ordered the Education Department to file monthly status reports detailing its compliance. The Project on Predatory Lending said that more than 3,000 borrowers made payments that they were not, in fact, required to make. More than 800 students have had their credit reports tarnished, and 1,800 had their wages garnished or tax refunds seized. More than 1,100 remain in limbo because the department has not yet confirmed whether they are in the correct repayment status. The department has essentially stopped evaluating borrower defense claims \u2014 leaving borrowers in limbo, sometimes for years \u2014 while it waits for the courts to resolve its appeal. The agency had 210,000 pending claims awaiting a decision as of June, up from the 106,000 claims it had sitting in its queue a year earlier. In August, the Education Department rewrote its rules for the borrower-defense program, making it significantly harder for borrowers to qualify. The new policies will apply to federal student loans made from July 2020 onward.",
