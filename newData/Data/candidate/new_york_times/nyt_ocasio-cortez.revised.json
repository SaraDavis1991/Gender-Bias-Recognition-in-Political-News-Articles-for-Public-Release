      "content": " Politics, like Hollywood, often looks to repeat a good thing: Find a formula that works, and stick with it. That strategy has led Democrats across the country, in races large and small, to search for candidates who might become the next Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the giant slayer who took down Representative Joseph Crowley in New York\u2019s primary. And in Brooklyn, there seemed to be no better or more natural choice than Julia Christine Salazar. Like Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, Ms. Salazar is young and Latina, poised and progressive, and a democratic socialist. Like Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, she boasted of blue-collar roots: she worked as a nanny, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez as a bartender. Neither had ever been elected to office. The easy and flattering comparison brought Ms. Salazar some fawning news media coverage, as she seeks to defeat State Senator Martin M. Dilan, who has represented north Brooklyn in Albany\u2019s upper chamber since 2003. But as next week\u2019s Democratic primary draws near, scrutiny of Ms. Salazar\u2019s history has revealed numerous inconsistencies in her background that threaten to undermine her candidacy. Most of the discrepancies center on her self-portrayal as a left-wing Democrat, an immigrant from Colombia, a Jewish woman with an Ivy League pedigree. But a series of published reports and interviews with family members have cast doubt and poked holes in her personal narrative. A left-wing Democrat? Ms. Salazar, 27, was a registered Republican at one point, and was the leader of a Right to Life group while attending Columbia University. She also did not graduate, though her website implies that she did. A Jewish woman? Her religious background is complicated: She was born in a Catholic family, and during college she served as president of Christians United for Israel. Ms. Salazar now identifies as Jewish, the result of a conversion she said she underwent in her early 20s. A Colombian immigrant? Earlier this summer, Ms. Salazar said that she \u201cimmigrated to this country with my family when I was very little,\u201d at a campaign event captured on video. Yet she was born in South Florida and lived there, largely raised by her mother, who was born in New Jersey. Her father, Luis, was a Colombian pilot who became an American citizen before Ms. Salazar was born. Mr. Dilan\u2019s campaign has cast such inconsistencies as fabrication, though Ms. Salazar\u2019s supporters say her version of events may be the result of semantics, campaign staff mistakes or gilding the lily \u2014 or even Rashomon-like recollections \u2014 rather than outright lies. \u201cIt is a disservice to voters and constituents in our district that Senator Dilan continues to choose to obsess over details of my early childhood and personal development,\u201d Ms. Salazar said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cRather than campaign on the issues.\u201d [Yet another twist in Ms. Salazar\u2019s tale has emerged: An old arrest and lawsuit involving the ex-Mets star Keith Hernandez and his then-estranged wife. Read about it here.] Much of Ms. Salazar\u2019s political trouble emerged after an article in Tablet Magazine, which dived into the candidate\u2019s political and religious beliefs, concluding that her identity as a \u201cpolitically radical working-class Jewish immigrant\u201d had been largely self-created. Other examinations followed, as did the inevitable pushback; a group of her college classmates jointly wrote a letter, published in the Forward on Wednesday, defending Ms. Salazar, saying that her \u201cpersonal story is complex, and it has been misrepresented by her opponents.\u201d In an interview last week in a coffee shop in Bushwick, Ms. Salazar said that she had undergone a political evolution since moving to New York in 2009 and believes she could be a senator \u201cwho has her ear to the ground, who has a record of actually building power in the community, bringing the voices of our community to City Hall and to Albany.\u201d \u201cI want to finally see a state senator, a state legislator representing this district who is actually accountable to the majority of residents of this district,\u201d she said. She attempted to clarify her background, while continuing to embrace the idea of herself as a child of immigration, saying she had spent a lot of emotionally significant time in Bogot\u00e1 as a child. \u201cI\u2019m not an immigrant myself,\u201d she said. \u201cRather, I have always felt a deep connection to my father\u2019s immigrant experience because of the time I spent with our family in Colombia at such a young age.\u201d Ms. Salazar said \u201cmy family was living in both the U.S. and Colombia at the time\u201d she was a small child, before her parents\u2019 divorce in 1998, when she was 7. \u201cWe were back and forth, literally, constantly,\u201d she said, later adding, \u201cMy earliest memories are of Colombia.\u201d Interviews with Ms. Salazar\u2019s older brother, Alex, a mango farmer still living in Florida, and their mother, Christine Salazar, clouded the issue. Mr. Salazar said he remembered only a pair of trips to Colombia during their childhood for short visits. \u201cWe weren\u2019t an immigrant family,\u201d Mr. Salazar, 29, said on Tuesday. \u201cIt was never something that was even considered.\u201d He added that his family\u2019s financial situation was \u201ccertainly middle class, or upper middle class,\u201d while living in the comfortable community in Jupiter, Fla., north of West Palm Beach. (\u201cI definitely disagree with Alex\u2019s memory,\u201d the candidate said, while noting that she was a toddler and infant for some of the time her parents were together, which \u201cprobably affects my ability to remember it.\u201d) For her part, Ms. Salazar\u2019s mother backed up elements of her daughter\u2019s claims, recalling at least a half-dozen visits to Colombia, and that \u201cthe Colombian culture was a huge part of our family.\u201d Ms. Salazar, 61, also said that while her children had lived in a nice house, she had sometimes struggled financially after she and her husband divorced. \u201cIf I could make it look easy for my kids, I did,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought that economic hardship was not a burden that kids that were going through a divorce needed to experience.\u201d Born into a Catholic family, Ms. Salazar said she converted to Judaism in her early 20s, and has been a part of a number of groups devoted to Jewish causes. Ms. Salazar said her interest in Judaism is rooted in family history and their Sephardic roots in Spain, and was spurred as she was mourning her father\u2019s death from prostate cancer in 2009, just as she was preparing to move to New York to attend Columbia. \u201cI started to search for meaning in my father\u2019s death,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cA lot of mysteries that I wanted to solve.\u201d Ms. Salazar\u2019s mother said that neither side of the family was Jewish, though she confirmed her late husband\u2019s family had a Sephardic background, and that Julia had been curious about it. \u201cThat\u2019s where her interest stems from,\u201d she said, noting that her daughter had traveled to Israel during college. \u201cThis is not something that was invented for the purposes of this campaign.\u201d Before her conversion, however, Ms. Salazar had been a Columbia chapter president of Christians United for Israel, and in 2012, she also was interviewed by the conservative commentator, Glenn Beck, and asked by Mr. Beck about rumors that professors at the university were \u201cMuslim Brotherhood and communist,\u201d and exposing anti-Israel beliefs. \u201cHow many are there, do you think?\u201d Mr. Beck asked, as Ms. Salazar nodded. \u201cI think there are probably several,\u201d she answered, adding, \u201cThey are using the classroom as their podium to spread lies about the State of Israel.\u201d Ms. Salazar said she left the Christians United group after a trip later that year to the West Bank, where she was disturbed by the Palestinians\u2019 living conditions. Around the same time, Ms. Salazar \u2014 who now supports the right to an abortion \u2014 had been the president of Columbia Right to Life, once writing an editorial for the Columbia Spectator entitled \u201cSupport the Right to be a Parent.\u201d She said her involvement in the group came through a friend and was short-lived, and focused around a health-services fee she opposed, which could be used to pay for abortion services. While she concedes she was \u201canti-abortion,\u201d she said she was never in favor of making abortion illegal, or engaged in tactics like picketing in front of clinics that offer the procedure. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t take the same position now,\u201d she said. Ms. Salazar, now a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, admitted to once being registered a Republican, something she ascribed to being raised in a \u201cvery conservative political family\u201d in Florida. \u201cFox News was always on,\u201d she said. Still, other details of Ms. Salazar\u2019s biography seem elided as well. On her campaign website, Ms. Salazar noted that she \u201csupported herself through Columbia University as a nanny,\u201d though she acknowledged that she did not graduate from the university and does not intend to. \u201cI\u2019m technically still on leave from my program since finishing my courses in 2014,\u201d Ms. Salazar said. The cumulative effect of the various discrepancies have left Ms. Salazar\u2019s opponent shaking his head. \u201cIt is hard to believe voters would judge Ms. Salazar based on whether she is an immigrant, or any of the other fanciful claims she has made in an attempt to create an identity that have been exposed as untrue,\u201d said Bob Liff, a spokesman for Mr. Dilan. \u201cBut voters do care if a candidate lies.\u201d",

      "content": "  Representative Joseph Crowley of New York, once seen as a possible successor to Nancy Pelosi as Democratic leader of the House, suffered a shocking primary defeat on Tuesday, the most significant loss for a Democratic incumbent in more than a decade, and one that will reverberate across the party and the country. Mr. Crowley was defeated by a 28-year-old political newcomer, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a former organizer for Bernie Sanders\u2019s presidential campaign, who had declared it was time for generational, racial and ideological change. The last time Mr. Crowley, 56, even had a primary challenger, in 2004, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez was not old enough to vote. Mr. Crowley, the No. 4 Democrat in the House, had drastically outspent his lesser-known rival to no avail, as Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s campaign was lifted by an aggressive social media presence and fueled by attention from national progressives hoping to flex their muscle in a race against a potential future speaker. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez had used Mr. Crowley\u2019s role in the leadership, and the fact that he was the head of the local Democratic Party machine, against him in her bid to upend the existing political class. She will face Anthony Pappas, the Republican candidate, in the November general election. [Read more on who Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is and her history] Mr. Crowley is the first House Democrat in the nation to lose a primary in 2018. His loss is most significant for a congressional incumbent since Eric Cantor, then the No. 2 Republican in the House, was defeated in 2014 to a Tea Party activist, David Brat. Like that contest, the Crowley defeat is expected to shake up Congress, where Mr. Crowley was seen as a top contender to replace Ms. Pelosi, if she stepped aside after the midterms. The race was not close. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez had more than 57 percent of the vote, with almost all precincts reporting. \u201cIt\u2019s surreal,\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said in a live television interview as the votes were being tallied. By then, no television showed results at what was supposed to have been Mr. Crowley\u2019s victory party. Mr. Crowley appeared rattled when he spoke. \u201cI know you\u2019re all trying your best to make me cry, but it\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d he told supporters. The guitar-strumming incumbent later played Bruce Springsteen\u2019s \u201cBorn to Run,\u201d and dedicated it to Ms. Ocasio-Cortez. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez is a native of the Bronx and a Latina in a Queens and Bronx district that is majority-minority, a fact she emphasized repeatedly on the trail against Mr. Crowley, who is white. In hindsight, the seat represented perhaps a perfect brew for an upset: a rusty incumbent, a charismatic challenger and a liberal district that gave Mr. Sanders more than 41 percent of the vote against Hillary Clinton. \u201cWomen like me aren\u2019t supposed to run for office,\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said at the start of a biographical video that went viral last month and was viewed more than half-a-million times. She ran as a woman, as a young person, as a working-class champion, as an unabashed liberal and as a person of color. She piled up endorsements from national progressive groups in recent weeks and from Cynthia Nixon, who is running her own insurgent bid for governor against Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. Ms. Nixon attended the Ocasio-Cortez victory party. \u201cWhat I see is that the Democratic Party takes working class communities for granted, they take people of color for granted and they just assume that we\u2019re going to turn out no matter how bland or half-stepping these proposals are,\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said in a recent interview about why she was running. [Our Politics editor is answering readers\u2019 questions about our political coverage. Submit your questions here.] A member of the Democratic Socialists of America, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez gathered endorsements from liberal groups like MoveOn, Democracy for America and People for Bernie. The news site The Intercept had urged her on, publishing a drumbeat of negative stories about Mr. Crowley, and glowing stories about her, in the campaign\u2019s closing weeks. President Trump, who like Mr. Crowley is from Queens, waded in on Twitter. \u201cThat is a big one that nobody saw happening,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote. \u201cPerhaps he should have been nicer, and more respectful, to his President!\u201d Days before the election, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez had unexpectedly left New York entirely to travel to Texas to protest the ongoing separation of children from their parents who crossed the border illegally. That came on the heels of her call to abolish the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. Mr. Crowley heated up his own rhetoric in response to her challenge, calling it a \u201cfascist organization,\u201d but stopped short of saying it should be dissolved. Ten days before the primary, Mr. Crowley skipped a debate against Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, and instead sent a surrogate, a Latina former city councilwoman. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez called it \u201ca bizarre twist\u201d on Twitter to be seated across from someone \u201cwith slight resemblance to me\u201d instead of her opponent. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez used the moment to generate a fresh wave of publicity in the race\u2019s crucial closing days. Waging a sharp and sometimes personal campaign, she attacked Mr. Crowley for not living in New York and, specifically, sending his children to school near Washington. When there was tear gas released on protesters in Puerto Rico, she tagged Mr. Crowley on Twitter and wrote, \u201cYou are responsible for this.\u201d And when he asked her at a debate if she would endorse him, if he prevailed, she pointedly refused. Mr. Crowley was not caught totally off guard. He had campaigned aggressively in the last six weeks, pouring hundreds of thousands of dollars into television ads and mailers, often highlighting his opposition to Mr. Trump. But in an indication of how disparate the two camps were and how much of an outsider Ms. Ocasio-Cortez was, Mr. Crowley said that, as of 11 p.m., they had yet to speak. He did not have her number and he did not believe she had his. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s triumph echoed some of the past upsets in New York City races that turned on a yearning for generational or racial change. In 1992, for example, Nydia Vel\u00e1zquez, then 39, became the first Hispanic woman to represent New York City when she defeated a veteran congressman in a newly drawn district that was filled with Puerto Rican voters. And two decades earlier, Elizabeth Holtzman, then only 31, unseated 84-year-old Representative Emanuel Celler, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, who had come to Congress during the Harding administration. Mr. Crowley\u2019s loss left Democrats in Washington stunned. In recent months, he had begun meeting with lawmakers in small groups in a quiet effort to prepare for a bid for the speakership. His departure leaves a gaping vacuum in the House, where he is the top-ranked Democrat under the age of 70. \u201cHi Nance,\u201d Mr. Crowley greeted Ms. Pelosi when she called him shortly after his defeat. He later told reporters, \u201cShe called me to tell me how much she loves me.\u201d Representative Steny Hoyer, a longtime rival of Ms. Pelosi\u2019s, now is freed from having to worry about Mr. Crowley in his ambition to be leader. But some House Democrats, speaking anonymously to discuss a delicate topic, said Tuesday night that given the party\u2019s changing face, it would be difficult to dump Ms. Pelosi for an older, white male lawmaker. In a flurry of phone calls and text messages, Democratic lawmakers floated names such as Cheri Bustos of Illinois, Linda Sanchez of California, Joseph Kennedy of Massachusetts and Seth Moulton of Massachusetts as potential younger alternatives to Ms. Pelosi. But Ms. Pelosi has made clear she intends to seek the post again if Democrats take back the House and it is not clear that any potential alternative candidate could build a coalition to defeat her. As for Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, she had complained in recent weeks about media coverage that didn\u2019t include her name but only that of the better-known man she was running against. \u201cHeadlines from the Political Patriarchy,\u201d she wrote on Twitter of one recent story. Now, she is likely to be in headlines for years to come.",

      "content": " It was an offer she could, in fact, refuse. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a 28-year-old democratic socialist from New York who scored a shocking primary victory over Representative Joseph Crowley in June, has since become a lightning rod for attacks from conservative circles. The conservative scrutiny on Ms. Ocasio-Cortez took a strange turn this week when a popular conservative commentator and speaker, Ben Shapiro, challenged Ms. Ocasio-Cortez to a debate and offered to pay her campaign $10,000 in return. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, who trounced Mr. Crowley, a longtime and powerful member of Congress from Queens, likened the offer to catcalling \u2014 the practice of whistling or making unwanted comments to women who pass by on the street. In a Twitter post on Thursday night, she roundly rejected his proposal. \u201cI don\u2019t owe a response to unsolicited requests from men with bad intentions,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd also like catcalling, for some reason they feel entitled to one.\u201d Social media soon erupted, with progressives rallying around her assessment that the proffer of money was misogynistic, and conservatives mocking Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s response as political correctness on steroids. Mr. Shapiro, a 34-year-old graduate of Harvard Law School, was an editor at large at Breitbart News before founding the Daily Wire, a conservative news and opinion website. He also makes dozens of appearances on college campuses a year, challenging students on everything from transgenderism to Obamacare to affirmative action. Called a polemicist by fans and a pugilist by detractors, Mr. Shapiro fired back at Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s dismissal of his debate proposition in a series of Twitter posts. \u201cDiscussion and debate are not \u2018bad intentions,\u2019\u201d he wrote. \u201cSlandering someone as a sexist catcaller without reason or evidence does demonstrate cowardice and bad intent, however.\u201d In a phone interview on Friday, Mr. Shapiro rejected that there was anything sexist about his offer, saying that he could see himself making a similar offer to an older, male ideological opponent. \u201cI would offer Bernie Sanders $50,000 to debate, absolutely,\u201d he said, referring to the Vermont senator. \u201cWhat in the world does this have to do with her being a woman?\u201d He also criticized Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s analogy of catcalling, labeling it an \u201cinsane\u201d accusation. \u201cI\u2019m an Orthodox Jew and I have never catcalled a woman in my life,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how they catcall down in Queens, but it must be weird.\u201d Corbin Trent, a spokesman for Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s campaign, declined to respond to Mr. Shapiro. \u201cShe said her piece and put it out there, and that\u2019s all we have to say,\u201d he said from Hawaii, where Ms. Ocasio-Cortez is campaigning for a fellow democratic socialist and congressional candidate, Kaniela Ing. This was not the first time that Ms. Ocasio-Cortez had engaged in a much-watched Twitter tussle since she defeated Mr. Crowley, who had been a contender for House speaker if Democrats managed to flip the chamber in November. Last month, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez lashed out at Mr. Crowley for his decision to remain on the Working Families Party line in the general election, despite the party asking Mr. Crowley to vacate it. She said he was trying to undermine her candidacy by mounting a third-party challenge, after he seemed to have graciously conceded the election by dedicating the Bruce Springsteen anthem, \u201cBorn to Run,\u201d to her at what was supposed to be his victory party. But Mr. Crowley, in his own Twitter post, said that there was no easy way to remove himself from the ballot. \u201cAlexandria, the race is over and Democrats need to come together,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI\u2019ve made my support for you clear and the fact that I\u2019m not running.\u201d",

      "content": " Yes, of course, we need a Green New Deal to address the world\u2019s most urgent crisis, global warming. Just, please, not the one that a flotilla of liberal politicians, including seven of the top Democratic presidential hopefuls currently in the Senate, are signing up for in droves, like children following the pied piper in the old legend. Our modern-day pied piper, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, is trying to lure us into a set of policies that might help save the planet but at the cost of severely damaging the global economy. To be sure, by the time the resolution was introduced into Congress, some of its most ludicrous provisions (like the deadline of 2030 for a full transition to renewable energy and the immediate halt to any investment in fossil fuels) had been eliminated or watered down. But as important as continuing to prune the absurd or damaging provisions would be to add what is the most effective way to attack climate change: using taxes and market forces rather than government controls to reduce harmful emissions. That has been a problem for decades, at least since Washington got seriously into the business of improving the environment, back in 1970 with the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency \u2014 under President Richard Nixon! Politicians prefer that approach because using regulation hides the costs of reducing emissions. The decision, for example, to force improvements in automobile mileage by requiring each manufacturer to improve overall fleet efficiency has added thousands of dollars to the cost of cars. Higher car prices have the countervailing impact of encouraging Americans to hang onto their older, less fuel-efficient cars for a longer time, offsetting at least some of the gains from newer cars. Nor have the regulations, with their many escape hatches, kept consumers from buying even more sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks as gas prices have remained historically low. Fortunately, there is a better way to address the climate problem at far lower cost to the economy: a tax on greenhouse gas emissions. That can be imposed in any number of ways. The 18.4 cent federal gasoline tax, for example, hasn\u2019t been increased since 1993 even as most other developed countries impose far higher levies. A particularly thoughtful proposal has come from the Climate Leadership Council, a bipartisan organization that counts more than 3,300 economists among its signatories. Elegant in its simplicity, the key provision would be the imposition of an escalating tax on carbon. At an initial rate of $43 per ton, the levy would be roughly equivalent to 38.2 cents per gallon of gasoline. To prevent polluters from fleeing overseas, the tax would be imposed on imports from countries lacking a similar provision while exports to those countries would not be taxed. While difficult to implement, that component is important to work out. The entire proceeds from the tax would be rebated to consumers. The council suggests an equal amount for each American; my view would be to exclude the wealthy (who hardly need the estimated $2,000 a year in payments) and disproportionately favor those closer to the bottom. Why are so many economists, even conservative ones, in favor of a massive new tax? Because markets do not always price in \u201cexternalities\u201d like pollution. In addition to cutting consumption, raising the price of carbon would arguably do more to encourage development of alternative power sources than all the massive new government spending programs that advocates of the Green New Deal envision. Some technical problems would need to be addressed, such as how the higher prices would filter through inflation calculations and create unintended cost of living adjustments to wages and Social Security payments. But those are details; the key point is that a carbon tax has been judged by climate hawks like Resources for the Future to be far more effective in reaching the goals of the Paris agreement than the well-intended regulations put in place by President Barack Obama and his predecessors. That\u2019s at least part of why the plan enjoys support from an armada of organizations not often on the same page, like Exxon Mobil and Conservation International. Historically, the politics of even small increases in the gasoline tax have been tough. A 2017 proposal in the House to increase tax by just one penny went nowhere. But recent polls suggest that perhaps sentiment is changing; a survey by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago found that 44 percent of Americans favor a carbon tax while only 29 percent oppose one. Given how late we are to the climate battle, maintaining some sensible regulation will also be necessary. But a hefty carbon tax would go a long way toward winning the war.",

Here was \u201csomeone who pretends to be a champion of the people,\u201d as the conservative activist Charlie Kirk put it on Twitter, dressing in clothes worth a few months rent, all the while \u201csaying the rich have too much power.\u201d The hosts of \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d had a great time telling everyone they didn\u2019t own, or want, $600 shoes. Appropriating signifiers from across class lines is, of course, a standard political move used to memorable advantage by, among others, George W. Bush, who successfully masked his patrician origins every time he put on a pair of Wranglers, a cowboy hat and a barn jacket. While authenticity is a sought-after characteristic in contemporary American politics, its currency is fairly limited. It is hard to imagine someone like John V. Lindsay, coming up in today\u2019s system, persuading the poor he understood their suffering while looking as though he had started each morning on the squash court. The imperative to mirror the demographic you are trying to court will always be called out as hypocrisy by the opposition when it seems phony or betraying and yet often it is simply the deployment of tactical ingenuity. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez needs the center-left \u2014 surely emboldened by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo\u2019s primary victory last week \u2014 to warm to her, to imagine that she isn\u2019t going to tear down the castles. How terrifying can someone dressed as though she had just left a meeting with six venture capitalists with a rare bottle of scotch really be to the occupants of the higher tax brackets? When the castigating got traction, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez shot back at her critics, pointing out the obvious \u2014 that she did not buy the clothes she wore for the shoot. They were lent to the magazine for the purpose of taking pictures. The suit she wore came from Gabriela Hearst, an Uruguayan designer, whose sensibilities are not hostile to the Ocasio-Cortez brand \u2014 the line makes use of compostable plastics for packaging and one runway show was inspired by Angela Davis. Any progressive who might have feared that the candidate was capitulating to the wealthy could say, \u201cWell, at least she is not in Chanel.\u201d I initially heard about the controversy from the Facebook posting of an investment banker I know whose politics do not lean to the far left. To my surprise, he was not critical. He posted one of the photographs from the Interview spread \u2014 of Ms. Ocasio-Cortez seated on a crumbling stoop \u2014 and the prices of the individual garments. \u201cI love a socialist fashion icon,\u201d he wrote, adding that she looked good and that he loved her \u201cseriously.\u201d I imagined that he was equally thrilled with the announcement that Michael Bloomberg, the high-priest of Wall Street-loving centrism, was thinking about getting into the next presidential race.",

      "content": " Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the Democratic candidate for Congress who quickly became a star of progressive politics after winning an upset victory in a New York House primary this summer, came under fire this week for excluding the press from two community meetings that were otherwise open to the public. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, who is predicted to win the 14th Congressional District, which includes parts of Queens and the Bronx, did not allow reporters to attend town hall meetings with residents on Aug. 8 and Aug. 12, The Queens Chronicle, a local weekly newspaper, reported Thursday. By Friday, the decision had become a flash point for arguments over politics and press freedom. Some journalists pushed back on Twitter and advocated open access to public events \u2014 one scoffed that Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, a political newcomer, would be in for a rough time on Capitol Hill, where reporters roam freely. Others on social media made comparisons with President Trump\u2019s claim that the media is the \u201cenemy of the people\u201d and argued over what constitutes a public or private event. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez called the controversy a \u201cnonstory.\u201d In tweets on Friday, she said that her community includes immigrants, victims of domestic violence and people with medical concerns. She said the two meetings were designed to help residents \u201cfeel safe discussing sensitive issues in a threatening political time.\u201d She said future events would be open to the news media. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, 28, a democratic socialist, rocketed to political stardom in June after defeating the Democratic incumbent, Representative Joseph Crowley, the No. 4 Democrat in the House. A former organizer for Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019s presidential campaign, she won on a progressive message that it was time for generational, racial and ideological change. She is expected to have little difficulty defeating the Republican candidate, Anthony Pappas, in a predominantly Democratic district that takes in working-class, immigrant-heavy swaths of the Bronx and Queens in November. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez has recently taken her message to other parts of the country, promoting other progressive candidates and at times campaigning with Mr. Sanders. The article in The Queens Chronicle criticized her for banning the press during local events after a national public relations tour. Her communications director, Corbin Trent, told The Washington Post that the campaign had done at least two dozen events with the news media in attendance since the primary, as well as 30 to 40 one-on-one interviews. \u201cWe\u2019ve been very open and accessible to the press, and will continue to be so,\u201d he said. Another campaign spokesman, Saikat Chakrabarti, said in an email on Friday night that the town hall meetings to which the news media were not invited were \u201cwildly successful\u201d in creating an inviting atmosphere to the community. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard overwhelmingly positive feedback from the hundreds of attendees since the event, and so we believe we succeeded in doing what we set out to do,\u201d Mr. Chakrabarti said, adding, \u201cFeel free to reach back out when you want to report on real issues affecting the lives of Americans.\u201d",

      "content": " Minutes after starting her acceptance speech on election night, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the newly elected congresswoman from Queens, was surprised to hear groans. \u201cWhoa \u2014 room turned fast,\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez joked. She, along with everyone in the room, had noticed a news update that had flashed across one of the giant screens above the crowd: Democrats had narrowly lost the Senate race in Texas. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez took quick stock of the mood of the crowd and resumed speaking. \u201cWhat we need to do as well, is realize that these short-term losses do not mean we have lost in the long run,\u201d she said. It was a theme Ms. Ocasio-Cortez peppered into her nearly 15-minute speech at her victory party in Queens, vowing to change, not just the Democratic Party, but politics in Washington, rather than allowing the status quo to change her. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, 29, became the youngest woman elected to the United States House of Representatives, capping a meteoric rise for someone who began the year as a bartender at a Union Square restaurant. After upsetting Representative Joseph Crowley in the June primary in the 14th Congressional District, which includes parts of Queens and the Bronx, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez became an instant star of the Democratic Party, whisking across the nation to help progressive, like-minded, candidates; Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, a democratic socialist, became a boogeyman for conservatives, who pounced on any perceived flaw or possible misstatement. [Are you a democratic socialist? Take this quiz.] But after her victory, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez must now contend with the challenge of using her voice and star power to bring change to the Democratic Party, and to help shape policy in a way that most first-term House members aren\u2019t asked to do. \u201cThere\u2019s so many people that know that we\u2019re going into the lion\u2019s den, even within the party,\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said in an interview this week. She said that voters have often approached her to talk about some of these challenges. \u201cWe know how much pressure you\u2019re going to be under even from within your own party,\u201d she said, echoing comments from constituents. \u201cWe know you\u2019re going to be under pressure to fall in line. Just please don\u2019t do it.\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said the fight to change the Democratic Party will be tougher than the battle against President Trump and the Republicans. When asked why, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez declined to be more specific, perhaps understanding the need for pragmatism when trying to forge alliances with Democrats. She spoke broadly about \u201csystemic issues that are impacting our democracy overall,\u201d like money in politics, and disparities between the rich and poor. But Ms. Ocasio-Cortez did say that she may continue to support progressive challengers to Democratic incumbents, a practice that irked some national Democratic leaders. \u201cIt\u2019s all kind of a case-by-base basis,\u201d she said. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez may be girding for a fight, but some colleagues are expecting an amicable relationship. Representative Carolyn Maloney of Manhattan, who defeated a young insurgent challenger in the primary, said she planned to host a luncheon with Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, and two newly elected state senators, Jessica Ramos and Julia Salazar, \u201cwho I think are going to be fabulous,\u201d Maloney said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be working together.\u201d Representative Adriano Espaillat of Upper Manhattan, a formerly undocumented resident who has prioritized immigration reform, agreed with Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s assessment of intraparty fighting. \u201cEven some of your friends, who you consider somewhat liberal, may have a tough time with some of these immigration issues,\u201d he said. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s tough to accept that the entire party doesn\u2019t rally behind Dreamers or behind these families that were being separated. \u201cSo it takes me further to the left when I see that,\u201d he added. Supporters at Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s election night party said they were drawn to her campaign because she was outspoken. They hoped this attitude would continue in office. \u201cEven if Democrats win, Alexandria is in the minority,\u201d because she is more progressive than her colleagues, said Hawk Newsome, founder of Black Lives Matter of Greater New York. \u201cShe is there to change the way business is done.\u201d Mr. Newsome said he hoped Ms. Ocasio-Cortez would criticize fellow House Democrats, like Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader \u2014 and whom Ms. Ocasio-Cortez has not committed to supporting \u2014 and New York\u2019s senior senator, Chuck Schumer, who leads Democrats in the Senate. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said that on Monday she spoke with Ms. Pelosi, who did not directly ask for support in her campaign to be re-elected speaker of the House. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said she also has recently met or traded phone calls with several members of the New York delegation. All have been welcoming, and full of advice on how to prepare for Washington. \u201cIt really is like high school orientation,\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said. \u201cIt\u2019s like you pick your committees the way you pick your courses. And people ask, like, little logistical things like, \u2018where you going to live?\u2019\u201d No decision there yet, she said. \u201cHonestly, I\u2019ve been so focused on today that I\u2019m not trying to count my chickens before they\u2019re hatched.\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said the transition period will be \u201cvery unusual, because I can\u2019t really take a salary. I have three months without a salary before I\u2019m a member of Congress. So, how do I get an apartment? Those little things are very real.\u201d She said she saved money before leaving her job at the restaurant, and planned accordingly with her partner. \u201cWe\u2019re kind of just dealing with the logistics of it day by day, but I\u2019ve really been just kind of squirreling away and then hoping that gets me to January.\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said she will skip a popular postelection meeting, which begins Friday, that draws many New York Democratic politicians to Puerto Rico because it conflicts with an orientation for new congressional members. And, as she put it, \u201cI need a minute.\u201d Campaign aides are focused on closely managing Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s time, in response to the enormous amounts of media obligations she\u2019s had the past few months. She\u2019s also had a regular presence on social media, where she has more than a million followers. That\u2019s likely to continue, along with all her appearances in Queens and in the Bronx. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said it\u2019s vital to meet people in person, for handshakes, selfies and conversations. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about a photo-op,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople tell you things. And they tell you what they believe. And they tell you what they want for themselves, for you, they tell you their stories.\u201d",

      "content": " Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the popular freshman Democrat from New York who is trying to use her star power to move the Democratic Party to the left, will headline a rally next week in Washington in favor of the Green New Deal, as she seeks to shore up support for the expansive climate legislation that has been met with skepticism by members of both parties. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, a co-sponsor of the Green New Deal, has long aligned herself with Sunrise Movement, the collection of young, hard-charging activists who are pressuring Democrats nationwide to take bolder actions to address climate change after years of what they see as an inadequate response. The May 13 rally at Howard University, the final stop on the group\u2019s nationwide \u201cGreen New Deal Tour,\u201d will make the case for the bill in the backyard of Capitol Hill, where party establishment figures such as Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, and Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, have been more wary of their party\u2019s progressive flank than many in their rank-and-file. \u201cFrom fire-scarred California to areas of the plains devastated by flooding, people are hungry for a big vision to transform our economy in line with science and justice demands,\u201d said Varshini Prakash, a co-founder of Sunrise Movement. \u201cI\u2019m thrilled to be joining Representative Ocasio-Cortez to close out the tour and lay out what\u2019s next in the Green New Deal campaign.\u201d Shortly after Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s election in November, she joined Sunrise Movement protesters in Ms. Pelosi\u2019s office, helping to raise the organization\u2019s national profile. During other stops on the group\u2019s tour, a video has played in which Ms. Ocasio-Cortez describes her vision of the coming decade, which includes a transition to a green economy and other items on the liberal wish list, like \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d a federal jobs guarantee and publicly funded elections. The Green New Deal aims to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to avoid the worst consequences of climate change, but it also seeks to address problems such as economic inequality and racial injustice by prioritizing historically disenfranchised communities. Critics say the legislation is too ambitious and has dim political prospects in a Congress where Republicans control the Senate. \u201cWe\u2019ve been clear since our campaign started \u2014 the Democratic Party needs to lay out a clear and bold vision for America,\u201d said Corbin Trent, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s spokesman. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not only the best path for our planet \u2014 but it\u2019s the best path strategically and electorally to take the Senate and White House.\u201d The rally comes at a critical time for Sunrise Movement and its allied organizations, which are trying to use the current lack of a clear leader in the national Democratic Party as an opportunity to push for progressive causes. The Green New Deal had been a major talking point in the Democratic presidential primary, but the conversation has lurched back toward the center in recent weeks, particularly with the entry of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who remains the race\u2019s pacesetter in terms of early fund-raising and polling. While Mr. Biden has not taken an official stand on the Green New Deal, his surrogates have repeatedly dismissed the idea, and said the better electoral strategy for Democrats would be a clear focus on reversing the presidency of Mr. Trump, not embracing new and controversial policies. But recently in South Carolina, in a sign of the grass-roots pressure Mr. Biden may face, he was asked at a rally if he would pledge not to accept donations from the fossil fuel industry. Mr. Biden said that he would, and that he had long supported the idea of publicly funded elections. Former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke, who is also running for president, recently took the same pledge Mr. Biden said he supported, after repeated pressure from activists including members of Sunrise Movement. Mr. O\u2019Rourke had previously received donations from oil and gas executives. \u201cWe don\u2019t want there to be any real or perceived conflicts of interests,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke said in his video announcing he had signed the pledge. He also singled out youth activists for helping push him on the issue. \u201cThank you for your advocacy and leadership.\u201d",

      "content": "   At the Parkchester apartments in the Bronx, neighbors heard the news from a maintenance worker: The woman down the hall had just won a primary and was probably headed for Congress. At a popular restaurant in Union Square in Manhattan, workers struggled to comprehend that the young politician whose face was all over TV really was the same woman who had tended bar until a few months ago. And on the streets of Midtown Manhattan Wednesday morning, the candidate herself was trying to make sense of it all. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez stood outside Rockefeller Center after appearing on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe,\u201d juggling phone calls and live TV interviews and the well-wishes of doormen and office workers on their coffee breaks. \u201cI\u2019m used to people kind of knowing me in the community,\u201d said Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, 28. But to have a stream of random people walk up and ask to take a selfie with her? \u201cInsane.\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, whose r\u00e9sum\u00e9 up to now included waitress, children\u2019s-book publisher, community activist, member of the Democratic Socialists of America and former Bernie Sanders campaign organizer, was now something else: an instant political rock star. She stunned the Democratic establishment by beating one of the senior leaders in the House, Joseph Crowley, in a near-landslide in Tuesday\u2019s primary. She is expected to have little difficulty defeating the Republican candidate, Anthony Pappas, in a predominantly Democratic district that takes in working-class, immigrant-heavy swaths of the Bronx and Queens in November. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez appeared to be adjusting to the intensity with the aplomb of a natural retail politician, graciously granting every request for a picture while staying cheerfully on a progressive message that has energized the Democrats\u2019 left wing. \u201cThank you!\u201d she said, over and over, eyes wide, smile wider, her hand flying to her chest. \u201cThank you so much.\u201d \u201cWhen you won, I was bawling,\u201d said Tahia Islam, a woman in her early 20s whose family lives in Queens. Ms. Islam was passing through the plaza on a break from her marketing job. \u201cI had my whole family vote for you.\u201d \u201cOh my God, thank you!\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said. \u201cTell your family thank you.\u201d [Read more on how Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez unseated one of the House\u2019s most powerful Democrats] Behind the scenes, of course, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s rise has been a little less sudden. \u201cFor two years,\u201d she said, \u201call I have been thinking about is 8:59 on June 26,\u201d when the polls closed on Tuesday night. But it goes back many years before that. As a teenager, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez never hesitated to speak her mind during political conversations around the dinner table. \u201cThere was nobody who could shut her up,\u201d said her mother, Blanca Ocasio-Cortez. \u201cI saw the political tendencies since she was very, very young.\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s mother was born in Puerto Rico. Her late father, Sergio Ocasio, an architect, was born in the Bronx. The family lived in Parkchester, a planned community of mid-rise buildings, in the same apartment where Ms. Ocasio-Cortez now lives, until Alexandria was about 5, when they moved an hour north to a modest two-bedroom house on a quiet street in Yorktown Heights, a suburb in Westchester County, in search of better schools. At Yorktown High School, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez was a serious science student and won second place in the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair in 2007. She presented her project, on the anti-aging effect of antioxidants in roundworms, to the town board of education, her science teacher Michael Blueglass said. \u201cOne of the administrators wasn\u2019t there at the beginning and came in after she started, and he said to the superintendent, \u2018What company is she from?\u2019\u201d Mr. Blueglass recalled. \u201cThe superintendent said, \u2018She\u2019s a 17-year-old senior in our high school.\u2019 She presented herself, verbally, visually, everything, as if she was a 30-year-old professional presenter businesswoman even though she was 17 years old.\u201d Mr. Blueglass said that even as a teenager, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez looked at science research through a political lens. \u201cShe was interested in research to help people in all areas, including developing nations, not just for the people with money.\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez went off to Boston University. Her father died early in her sophomore year. She took only a week off from school, and afterward, threw herself into her studies. \u201cShe jumped from having good grades to being on the dean\u2019s list,\u201d her mother said. She majored in economics and international relations, impressing the professor who taught an antitrust economics class, Marc Rysman, with \u201cgreat analytic abilities.\u201d She also dabbled in establishment politics during college, working for Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, on immigration, but soon turned her attention to the grass-roots work that would come to define her candidacy. Returning to the Bronx after graduation, she began advocating improved childhood education and literacy, starting a children\u2019s book publishing company that sought to portray her home borough in a positive light. She returned to national politics when she worked as an organizer for the Sanders campaign. She has credited her decision to seek office with her experience protesting at the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe reservation in 2016 against the Dakota Access Pipeline. Around that time, she was contacted by Brand New Congress, a newly formed progressive organization that asked her to run. She has also worked for years teaching summer courses in community leadership to high school students for the National Hispanic Institute. She continued working until February behind the bar at Flats Fix, a taco restaurant in Union Square (where a photo of her mixing a drink still adorns their home page), heading off to political meetings and fund-raising house parties after her shift. \u201cI spent the entire first part of this campaign just going to people\u2019s living rooms and having them invite their neighbors, and just doing little coffee parties for like six or seven months,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s how we really started this campaign.\u201d Her campaign evolved into something of a digital and door-to-door crusade. She and her campaign\u2019s digital staff used Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to turn out new voters and push a progressive message that included calls for tuition-free public colleges, Medicare for All, and the abolition of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. \u201cThe scope of the digital effort for a campaign like this was massive,\u201d said Jake DeGroot, who helped to manage Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s digital efforts. About 30 volunteers used a private WhatsApp group to coordinate social media strategy, according to Ananya Kumar-Banerjee, another volunteer with the campaign. On Facebook, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s team spent months refining and testing various get-out-the-vote messages and campaign announcements in English and Spanish. Since early May, when Facebook began archiving political ads in a public database, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s campaign purchased about 180 ads for her official Facebook and Instagram pages. Mr. Crowley\u2019s campaign bought 110 Facebook and Instagram ads during the same time period, all in English. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez also kept with her ground game, saying it was important to \u201ccommit to grass roots, on-the-ground organizing, to knocking on those doors and making those numbers and phone calls.\u201d On Tuesday, Primary Day, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez still did not know where she was going to have her \u201cwatch party\u201d for the election results. She finally settled on a billiard hall in the Bronx. In the car there, she put her phone away and did not check the returns. \u201cEverybody in the car we were in was so nervous,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were just like, \u2018Don\u2019t check it, don\u2019t check.\u2019\u201d As the car pulled up, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez saw through a window a headline on a screen inside that put her in the lead. \u201cSo I just started running,\u201d she said. \u201cI literally ran and I busted through the doors.\u201d",

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez recently dismissed questions about the Israel-Palestine conflict by claiming she was \u201cnot the expert on geopolitics on this issue.\u201d And as other candidates across the United States scramble to get votes from self-declared socialists by, say, supporting single-payer health care, few feel the need to appeal to the left on foreign policy. To be fair, there are good reasons leftists haven\u2019t grappled much with foreign policy. For one, there are few decision makers from whom they can learn: Since the early days of the Cold War, foreign policymaking has been dominated by a bipartisan commitment to militarism and American hegemony; those who depart from the consensus view have largely been kept out of the State Department, the Pentagon and other parts of the government. At the same time, the left itself lacks institutions dedicated to developing foreign policy ideas. While Republicans and moderate Democrats have a host of think tanks pushing interventionism, no corporation or billionaire has yet decided to fund a left-wing foreign policy think tank to which politicians could turn for advice. But if the left wing of the Democratic Party wants to be taken seriously, it must speak convincingly about security and diplomacy. Without core, identifiable beliefs about foreign affairs, left-wing politicians will either embarrass themselves or repeat some version of the tired conventional wisdom. Moreover, there is an opportunity here: Just as many Americans are fed up with the economic status quo, so too are they fed up with business as usual in foreign policy. A foreign policy for the left won\u2019t emerge overnight. A conversation is just starting to take place, and it will continue as more socialists win power and shape American politics. Though a concrete agenda remains a ways off, there are five broad principles that merge the left\u2019s commitment to egalitarianism and democracy with a sober analysis of the limits of American power. Left-wing politics is, at its heart, about giving power to ordinary people. Foreign policy, especially recently, has been about the opposite. Since the 1940s, unelected officials ensconced in bodies like the National Security Council have been the primary makers of foreign policy. This trend has worsened since the Sept. 11 attacks, as Congress has relinquished its oversight role and granted officials in the executive branch and the military carte blanche. Foreign policy elites have been anything but wise and have promoted several of the worst foreign policy blunders in American history, including the wars in Vietnam and Iraq. The left should aim to bring democracy into foreign policy. This means taking some of the power away from the executive and, especially, White House institutions like the National Security Council and returning it to the hands of Congress. In particular, socialist politicians should push to reassert Congress\u2019s long-abdicated role in declaring war, encourage more active oversight of the military and create bodies that make national security information available to the public so that Americans know exactly what their country is doing abroad. The American foreign policy establishment is notoriously forgiving \u2014 of itself. Rarely are policymakers held to account when they offer bad advice, such as supporting a disastrous war in Iraq or helping organize torture or assassinations. This amnesia has plagued Democrats and Republicans alike. This unaccountability cannot continue. A system that does not punish poor foreign-policy making is a system doomed to repeat its mistakes. Politicians on the left should make this a core tenet of their approach to foreign policy by promising that when they are elected, they will hold decision makers and advisers professionally accountable. But professional accountability is not enough. The left should demand that those who violated domestic or international law see justice, even if that means prosecuting them. It will enable the left to demonstrate to both the American people and the international community that it is serious about the rule of law. The United States controls roughly 800 military bases in dozens of countries around the world. This is far more than any other power. The United States also spends more on its military than China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, India, France, Britain and Japan combined. American Special Operations forces were deployed to 149 countries as of last year. Reducing this military footprint, and thus lessening the havoc the United States wreaks abroad, must be a priority for the left. This reduction should be framed as both a foreign policy goal and an issue of domestic justice. It is unconscionable that the United States spends so much on its military while inequality grows and social programs are underfunded. Cutting military spending will also address another priority of the left: corruption. As William Hartung at the Center for International Policy has argued, almost half of the military budget goes to private corporations that squander our tax dollars \u201con useless overhead, fat executive salaries and startling (yet commonplace) cost overruns on weapons systems and other military hardware that, in the end, won\u2019t even perform as promised.\u201d A less militaristic United States is a more just United States. We can bring our troops home and cut the military budget because the United States doesn\u2019t face any serious external challengers. North Korea, Iran, the Islamic State, Russia and China can\u2019t challenge American sovereignty in the ways Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union once did. While there are admittedly serious global threats, none are existential and none are unmanageable. But for too long, politicians have inflated international threats to justify military adventurism, boost military spending, increase domestic surveillance and campaign on a politics of fear. The left should change that. Candidates and policymakers alike should educate the public about the United States\u2019 relative safety. Such education will encourage a military drawdown, engender a more honest domestic politics and protect Americans\u2019 civil liberties. None of this means the United States should retreat from the world. Rather, America should engage with other countries through peaceful diplomacy. An important first step would be to embrace international treaties and institutions endorsed by most nations, like the Paris Agreement on climate change and the International Criminal Court. Moreover, policymakers should urge disarmament talks with all major powers and reinstate the Iran nuclear deal. The left should also commit itself to reducing global economic inequality by reordering the hierarchical relationships that benefit rich countries over poor ones. For example, the left should not allow American-led corporations to use underpaid and abused workers to produce inexpensive products. Policymakers should also prevent the wealthy from avoiding taxation by working with foreign countries to shutter tax havens. Finally, the left should take human rights seriously. In particular, left-wing foreign-policy makers should pressure allies like Saudi Arabia and Israel to stop committing human rights abuses by withholding arms transfers and other forms of assistance. A democratic socialist left is shaping the conversation in American politics right now. This makes it necessary for left-wing politicians to think beyond bread-and-butter issues and to develop new ways of approaching the United States\u2019 world role. An explicit program may not yet exist, but the five principles discussed above can serve as the base upon which future leaders can build a left-wing foreign policy that ushers in a more just and peaceful era.",

      "content": " Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the self-described Puerto Rican \u201cgirl from the Bronx\u201d who is set to become the youngest congresswoman in American history next month, added another layer to a complex personal story: She has Jewish heritage. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat, made the reveal on Sunday evening at a Jackson Heights synagogue in Queens, telling the crowd that \u201ca very, very long time ago, generations and generations ago, my family consisted of Sephardic Jews.\u201d She dated her ancestry to those who had to flee Europe during the Spanish Inquisition more than 500 years ago, and sought refuge in the New World. \u201cSome of those people landed in Puerto Rico,\u201d she explained. \u201cAs is the story of Puerto Rico, we are a people that are an amalgamation,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are no one thing. We are black; we are indigenous; we are Spanish; we are European.\u201d The announcement seemed to delight the Queens synagogue celebrating Hanukkah, according to video of the event. Amid laughter, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez replied to someone in the crowd. \u201cHe\u2019s like: \u2018I told you! I knew it! I sensed it!\u201d The story quickly spread from news outlets in America to Israel. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, 29, who danced and helped light the menorah on Sunday, has in her own life identified as Catholic. She wrote a piece in America, a Jesuit publication, over the summer titled, \u201cAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Her Catholic Faith and the Urgency of Criminal Justice Reform.\u201d On Monday, as the video went viral, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez tried to get ahead of any criticism of her ancestral claims. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts has faced scrutiny for her claims of Native American heritage, only to endure more criticism after she released results of a DNA test. \u201cBefore everyone jumps on me \u2014 yes, culture isn\u2019t DNA,\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez wrote on Twitter, the social network that has helped vault her career and where she counts more than 1.5 million followers, more than all but a few members of Congress. \u201cBut to be Puerto Rican is to be the descendant of: African Moors + slaves, Taino Indians, Spanish colonizers, Jewish refugees, and likely others. We are all of these things and something else all at once \u2014 we are Boricua.\u201d She provoked some outrage earlier this year when she referred to Israel\u2019s \u201coccupation of Palestine,\u201d in an interview with PBS, citing Israeli settlements. As she was asked to expand on her thoughts, she added she was \u201cnot the expert on geopolitics on this issue.\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, even before taking office, has become a favorite target of conservatives and conservative media. Last week, she got into an online spat with Donald Trump Jr., the president\u2019s son, who posted a meme about her and socialism on Instagram. \u201cI have noticed that Junior here has a habit of posting nonsense about me whenever the Mueller investigation heats up. Please, keep it coming Jr \u2014 it\u2019s definitely a \u2018very, very large brain\u2019 idea to troll a member of a body that will have subpoena power in a month,\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez replied on Twitter. To which Mr. Trump\u2019s girlfriend, the former Fox News personality Kimberly Guilfoyle, retorted on Twitter: \u201cDid you just threaten to subpoena someone for criticizing you? As a lawyer and former prosecutor, I find this deeply troubling.\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez will be sworn into Congress in January.",

      "author": "Caroline Fredrickson",
      "content": " On Wednesday, Michael Cohen, President Trump\u2019s one-time personal lawyer and \u201cfixer,\u201d testified in front of the House Oversight and Reform Committee about what he says are a variety of shady practices he participated in when working for the president. People around the country awaited riveting testimony, some going so far as to join \u201cwatch parties\u201d in bars. But like so many congressional hearings, the fireworks were quick to flame out. Even with the tantalizing opportunity to grill Mr. Cohen on the myriad ways his former boss most likely sought to evade the law and avoid his creditors, many members of the committee, from both parties, could not resist their usual grandstanding. Consider the line of questioning from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. She asked Mr. Cohen a series of specific questions about how Mr. Trump had handled insurance claims and whether he had provided accurate information to various companies. \u201cTo your knowledge,\u201d she asked, \u201cdid Donald Trump ever provide inflated assets to an insurance company?\u201d He had. She asked whether Mr. Trump had tried to reduce his local taxes by undervaluing his assets. Mr. Cohen confirmed that the president had also done that. \u201cYou deflate the value of the asset and then you put in a request to the tax department for a deduction,\u201d Mr. Cohen said, explaining the practice. These were the sort of questions, and answers, the committee was supposed to elicit. Somehow, only the newer members got the memo. [Get a more personal, less conventional take on political developments, newsmakers, cultural milestones and more with Frank Bruni\u2019s weekly newsletter.] Ms. Ocasio-Cortez continued, asking, \u201cDo you think we need to review financial statements and tax returns in order to compare them?\u201d She pressed Mr. Cohen for the names of others who would be able to corroborate the testimony or provide documents to support the charges. In response, Mr. Cohen listed the executives Allen Weisselberg, Ron Lieberman and Matthew Calamari \u2014 names that, thanks in part to Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, we will probably hear more about in the coming months. These questions were not random, but, rather, well thought out. Like a good prosecutor, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez was establishing the factual basis for further committee investigation. She asked one question at a time, avoided long-winded speeches on why she was asking the question, and listened carefully to his answer, which gave her the basis for a follow-up inquiry. As a result, Mr. Cohen gave specific answers about Mr. Trump\u2019s shady practices, along with a road map for how to find out more. Mr. Cohen began his testimony calling Mr. Trump a \u201ccon man and a cheat\u201d; In just five minutes, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez actually helped him lay out the facts to substantiate those charges. Unfortunately, too few of her colleagues followed suit. In his testimony, Mr. Cohen claimed numerous ethical breaches and criminal acts on the part of the president, many for which Mr. Cohen himself apparently served as main actor. He spoke of illegal campaign payoffs, rigging of electoral polls, threatening people who had crossed the president, possible witness tampering, and even falsifying financial records. He spoke of conduct in and out of office that would cross even the most generous reading of ethical and legal boundaries. All of these areas offered fruitful avenues for exploration. But instead of asking probing questions and eliciting damning evidence from Mr. Cohen, too many committee members chose to make a speech. Jeffrey Toobin of The New Yorker tweeted in frustration, \u201cBipartisan incompetence in the questioning at #cohen hearing. All they do is make speeches, and fail to listen to answers or follow up.\u201d He then tweeted sample follow-up questions, hoping desperately that someone might just try. He did give credit to several members who understand the art of questioning, including Representatives Katie Hill and Jackie Speier. But it is shocking how few members actually understand the basic function of a hearing \u2014 or chose to ignore collective goals in favor of showboating. As someone who has worked on the Hill and as a nonprofit advocate, I am accustomed to the frustration of opportunities lost, of questions not asked, or of witnesses who are allowed to get away without really answering a question. Often the stakes are low and so the cost is not so great. But as Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings\u2019s outstanding closing remarks made clear, what we face now as a nation is so consequential, as the president faces multiple inquiries about possible collusion with a foreign power, that we need more from members of Congress. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez has many followers on social media. I hope her colleagues will start to follow her example in the hearing room.",

      "content": " In the opening moments of the documentary \u201cKnock Down the House,\u201d the candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is looking in a mirror, dabbing on makeup and talking to the camera about the widely divergent standards for male and female politicians. As a neophyte in an entrenched system, she says, she is bracing herself. Then again, she adds, \u201cHow do you prepare for something you don\u2019t know is coming?\u201d That\u2019s the question that \u201cKnock Down the House\u201d tries to answer, as it follows four long-shot candidates, all women, vying to unseat veteran Democratic politicians \u2014 all men \u2014 in the 2018 primaries. Arriving this week on Netflix and in select theaters, the film has already received rapturous attention and produced floods of inspired tears on the festival circuit, earning a top audience prize at Sundance this year, where Netflix bought it for a reported $10 million, a record for a documentary. For AOC fans \u2014 and probably her critics, too \u2014 it offers revealing footage of the upstart New York congresswoman before she became a media and political sensation: hauling ice at her day job as a bartender; confessing insecurities and reciting affirmations inside the modest Bronx apartment she shares with her boyfriend. She and the other women, in races across the country, deliver a warts-and-all look at what grass-roots campaigning means, with few restrictions for the filmmakers. \u201cI kind of wanted to make the process as raw and as accessible as possible,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez, 29, said in a recent interview. A few months into office, she\u2019s still adjusting to the trappings of the role. \u201cHey, this is Alex,\u201d she said at the beginning of the call, then caught herself: \u201cI guess Congresswoman \u2026.\u201d Nope, not right either. \u201cYou can call me Alexandria,\u201d she concluded and laughed. She agreed to let a filmmaker tail her even before she filed her paperwork to run \u2014 even before she had decided to run, really \u2014 because she wanted to document how to organize an insurgent campaign, she said, especially as a working-class person. That sentiment was echoed by the other candidates: Cori Bush of St. Louis; Amy Vilela of Las Vegas; and Paula Jean Swearengin, from Coal City, W.Va. \u201cI felt that we had to stop reinventing the wheel every single time a normal person decided to run for office,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said, \u201cand make it accessible, so we can learn and iterate. Our democracy is supposed to belong to everyday people.\u201d For Rachel Lears, who directed and shot the movie, co-written with her husband, Robin Blotnick, who also edited it, it was a boots-on-the-ground investigation of how to change political power. \u201cI hope that this story does push people to think about participating in different ways,\u201d Lears, 41, said. She approached the progressive organizations Brand New Congress and, later, Justice Democrats, which were recruiting novice candidates; she interviewed two dozen of them, she said, including some men, before settling on the four women, because she thought that win or lose, they\u2019d be compelling to watch. \u201cThey all had very personal reasons for what they were doing,\u201d she said, catapulting themselves into politics out of family tragedy, economic hardship, environmental anguish or a quest for social justice. Their geographic diversity, gender and race \u2014 in what became a historic midterm for women and people of color \u2014 was meant to illustrate \u201ca group that would make a national movement,\u201d Lears said. Still, said Blotnick, \u201cwe were totally prepared for all four candidates to lose.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s story became the movie\u2019s spine, in part because the couple was also based in New York \u2014 their shoestring budget didn\u2019t allow them to travel to the other candidates as much. (They filmed for a year before getting outside financing, via Kickstarter; only after Ocasio-Cortez won her primary in June 2018 did they feel confident about securing industry backing.) Their son, now 3, also accompanied them on the road. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have child care, so that was my job,\u201d Blotnick, 39, said. Their working-parent juggle endeared them to their subjects, three of whom are mothers in their 40s and all of whom went without as they campaigned, too. Vilela, running for a House seat, quit her job as a financial executive and sold her family\u2019s home. \u201cWe had to downsize everything,\u201d she said. \u201cWe ended up going into debt.\u201d She wanted to be part of a political shift \u201cmore than I loved the benefits of my lifestyle and the career I held.\u201d Equally tough was the choice to depict the emotional moment when she lost. \u201cAs a businesswoman, you\u2019re always told, \u2018You should never let them see you cry,\u2019\u201d Vilela said. \u201cBut at the end, it came down to: Darn it, I wish more of our politicians would cry.\u201d On primary night, she got a supportive call from Ocasio-Cortez. \u201cWhat I love about the vulnerability that we see, throughout this entire film from everybody \u2014 it shows the world a different model of strength,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m like ugly crying on a screen.\u201d That her vulnerabilities may now be fodder for Republicans doesn\u2019t faze her. \u201cI already know they\u2019re going to screen grab shots of me crying and make memes out of it,\u201d she said. Bring it, was her message. \u201cI think the fact that you have nothing to hide is a huge and intimidating strength,\u201d she said. Despite the filmmakers\u2019 repeated requests, Lears said, none of the women\u2019s opponents agreed to be interviewed for the documentary. Swearengin, a coal miner\u2019s daughter and environmental activist, who works as a medical biller, challenged the wealthy West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin. Institutional resistance, she said, came \u201cnot only because I was a woman, but because I was a poor girl from the coal fields \u2014 which was the appeal to a lot of West Virginians.\u201d (In a red state, she earned more votes than the winner in the Republican primary.) Cori Bush, a St. Louis nurse who was active around the protests in Ferguson, Mo., and who ran against a long-term congressman, Lacy Clay, said she, too, felt pushback because of her identity. \u201cI heard things, wow,\u201d she said, like, \u201cI need to have a husband in order to run. I also heard that I needed to change my hair, that braids looked unprofessional. And if I wanted to get into certain rooms with real people who were real donors, I could never look like a nurse.\u201d But for her, part of the point of running was looking exactly like who she was. \u201cRepresentation is important,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m a nurse because I saw a black woman working as a nurse and that taught me that I can do this. And in the same way, I want other black girls to see that it\u2019s O.K., that you can do this.\u201d She has already filed to run again. Given the filmmakers\u2019 access and Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s unprecedented trajectory, the movie could have just been about her. But they never considered eliminating the other women, said Blotnick, the editor. \u201cIf we were only to show what happened in her race, we could risk falling into fairy-tale territory,\u201d he said. If anything unsettled Ocasio-Cortez, it was exposing her relationship with her boyfriend, Riley Roberts, which the couple has otherwise tried to keep under wraps. \u201cIt is this one part of my life that I\u2019ve been able to take refuge in,\u201d she said. She was most nervous, she added, that Roberts, a web consultant who doesn\u2019t have a visible social media presence, would face the same scrutiny she has. No more sweatpants in public, she warned. But being in the film was also therapeutic for her, she said, allowing her to reflect on the campaign as it happened. And as an origin story, she hopes it provides some clarity. \u201cSometimes when I\u2019m in D.C., people think I\u2019m like this alien, you know?\u201d she said. Why are she and her squad of boundary-breaking newbie congresswomen so outspoken, so demanding? The movie has an answer: \u201cBecause you see the blood, sweat and tears that it took just for us to get a seat at the table. It brings a different intensity and urgency.\u201d Watching the movie motivates her, too. \u201cIt\u2019s a reminder of the energy that it took to get here, and what an enormous opportunity this is. It makes me feel like I have to squeeze every drop out of it.\u201d",

      "content": " Democratic voters in New York\u2019s 14th Congressional District delivered a shock to the political system Tuesday night, rejecting the fourth-highest-ranking member of the party\u2019s House leadership, Representative Joseph Crowley, in favor of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a 28-year-old former Bernie Sanders campaign organizer who has called for abolishing the nation\u2019s immigration and customs enforcement agency. In doing so, voters delivered a message to Democrats and Republicans across the country, and perhaps in Albany: The liberal base is fired up, showing up at the polls, and may be ignored only at great political risk. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s victory is a vivid sign of the changing of the guard. In addition to more liberal immigration laws, she ran on a platform calling for Medicare for all and a federal jobs guarantee. She also talked about the housing crisis in New York City, an issue that resonates deeply with many voters here. Her district, which runs through Queens and the Bronx, is majority-minority, but its leadership has yet to reflect those changes. That\u2019s something Ms. Ocasio-Cortez was able to capitalize on fluently, casting herself as part of a new generation of young, unabashedly liberal Democrats unwilling to wait their turn any longer. Many told Ms. Ocasio-Cortez she was crazy for challenging Mr. Crowley, a 10-term incumbent who had ambitions to succeed the House Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi of California. As chairman of the Queens County Democratic Party, Mr. Crowley, 56, was a kingmaker in New York City politics. At his annual holiday party, city officials were expected to perform karaoke, singing and dancing on the stage to a song of Mr. Crowley\u2019s choosing. That power perhaps created a sense of hubris and complacency, the kind that no doubt contributed to Hillary Clinton\u2019s loss to Donald Trump. In Mrs. Clinton\u2019s case, it may have stopped her from campaigning harder in states like Wisconsin and Michigan, places where Mr. Trump eked out narrow victories. In Mr. Crowley\u2019s case, it may have led him to become smug: The congressman had also skipped a debate with Ms. Ocasio-Cortez. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s victory is also a reminder of the importance of improving healthy competition in Democratic primaries, where voters are too often taken for granted, especially in solidly blue states like New York, leading to lethargic turnout and weaker candidates. And many newly motivated women and other activists around the country are challenging Republican incumbents who others thought were unbeatable. What remains to be seen, though, is whether Democratic leaders will embrace these newcomers or see them as a threat. That may determine whether Democrats are able to take back the House of Representatives in November. Many voters are ready for something different. Politicians across the country should take note.",

Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, a liberal firebrand from the Bronx, has given her chief of staff, Saikat Chakrabarti, remarkable latitude to pursue the divisive politics that made his name when he led Justice Democrats, a group founded to challenge entrenched Democrats through primary campaigns. With that license, Mr. Chakrabarti has become an unelected symbol of the party\u2019s growing disunity, as Democrats try to coalesce as a party before what promises to be a punishing fight next year for the White House. The battle between the Democrats who secured the House majority last year by flipping Republican districts and the smaller, but politically potent, left-wing from secure Democratic districts has found its cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre. Mr. Chakrabarti ignited a firestorm two weeks ago after a bruising intraparty fight over an emergency border aid package that progressives said lacked sufficient restrictions on the Trump administration. Calling out moderate Democrats who sank a more liberal aid package, he compared them to \u201cnew Southern Democrats.\u201d They \u201ccertainly seem hell bent to do to black and brown people today what the old Southern Democrats did in the 40s,\u201d he said on Twitter. He later deleted the tweet. On Friday night, Democratic leaders showed that they had enough. Using the House Democratic Caucus\u2019s official Twitter account, they delivered a rhetorical slap that questioned not only Mr. Chakrabarti\u2019s future but also whether Ms. Ocasio-Cortez wanted to be a lawmaker on the inside or an outsider campaigning to purge the party of centrists and force it to the left. The rebuke shared a tweet by Mr. Chakrabarti that explained that he believed Representative Sharice Davids of Kansas, one of the two first Native American women to serve in Congress, was enabling a \u201cracist system\u201d in voting for a weaker border aid package. \u201cI don\u2019t think people have to be personally racist to enable a racist system,\u201d the aide had written, to which Democratic leaders demanded,\u201cWho is this guy and why is he explicitly singling out a Native American woman of color?\u201d The slap ended with, \u201cKeep her name out of your mouth.\u201d That last phrase was filled with its own meaning. It echoed a blow delivered on Tuesday to the White House adviser Kellyanne Conway by Representative Ayanna S. Pressley of Massachusetts, a member of Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s \u201csquad,\u201d who wrote, \u201cKeep my name out of your lying mouth.\u201d To further make the point, Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s deputy chief of staff, Drew Hammill, retweeted the slap. Mr. Chakrabarti, a former Silicon Valley start-up founder turned left-wing political organizer, has defiantly retained his outsider streak even after becoming a chief of staff at one of the nation\u2019s most establishment institutions, the House. That has riled ranks of Democratic lawmakers and aides. While convention on Capitol Hill holds that aides are to be seen and not heard, he has publicly and repeatedly criticized Ms. Pelosi. Perhaps most galling to lawmakers, he has also encouraged his Twitter followers to support liberal candidates trying to oust sitting Democrats, an uneasy reminder of his work with Justice Democrats. He has cultivated a remarkably high profile for a congressional aide. He \u201cisn\u2019t just running her office,\u201d a Washington Post Magazine profile of him said, \u201che\u2019s guiding a movement.\u201d A headline from Elle magazine crowed, \u201cYou Need to Know Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Chief of Snacks Saikat Chakrabarti.\u201d Mr. Chakrabarti has also remained defiant. He dismissed the rebuke from Democratic leadership Friday night, arguing that \u201cEverything I tweeted 2 weeks ago was to call out the terrible border funding bill that 90+ Dems opposed.\u201d \u201cOur Democracy is literally falling apart,\u201d Mr. Chakrabarti tweeted. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in substance-less Twitter spats.\u201d Justice Democrats, the group he founded, and over a dozen other progressive groups backed him on Saturday, releasing a statement expressing concern that \u201csenior Democratic Party leaders and their aides have been escalating attacks on new leaders in the party\u201d and urging them to focus on \u201cthe real crisis at hand\u201d at the border. The drama may be more reminiscent of a high school student council than the House of Representatives, but it has created a dilemma for Ms. Ocasio-Cortez. The progressive darling has remained silent on her aide\u2019s remarks; her spokesman declined to comment on Saturday. Asked on Thursday to comment on her aide\u2019s earlier tweets, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez replied that she had \u201cnot been paying attention to this.\u201d That is likely to further anger House members, many of whom are people of color representing moderate to conservative districts. It is considered a breach of protocol for unelected congressional aides to criticize lawmakers even in closed-door meetings \u2014 much less publicly blast out their grievances \u2014 and those who step out of line typically face consequences. As the chairman of a powerful conservative caucus, Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the No. 2 Republican, fired a top aide in 2013 after allegations that the aide had allied with conservative advocacy groups to blow up a Republican leadership budget deal. \u201cWe all rely on staff, but we have to have the full trust of our staff,\u201d Mr. Scalise said at the time. But Ms. Ocasio-Cortez prides herself on eschewing convention \u2014 an instinct that guided her ascent to become the youngest-ever elected congresswoman \u2014 and so far has extended that approach to her staff. Shortly after arriving to Capitol Hill, her legislative assistant, Dan Riffle, gave an interview in which he described fellow Democratic congressional aides as Ivy League \u201ccareerists\u201d who \u201cdon\u2019t think big and aren\u2019t here to change the world.\u201d Mr. Chakrabarti also has unloaded his grievances, sparing no one. \u201cPelosi claims we can\u2019t focus on impeachment because it\u2019s a distraction from kitchen table issues. But I\u2019d challenge you to find voters that can name a single thing House Democrats have done for their kitchen table this year,\u201d Mr. Chakrabarti wrote after the divisive vote on border aid. \u201cWhat is this legislative mastermind doing?\u201d \u201cI like to show my cards and see people\u2019s reactions,\u201d Mr. Chakrabarti told The Washington Post Magazine, echoing President Trump. But other controversies have dogged him \u2014 in part because of the outsize attention Ms. Ocasio-Cortez receives from right-wing news outlets \u2014 for a lack of forthrightness. After graduating from Harvard, Mr. Chakrabarti worked for a year as a technology associate at the hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, and then moved to Silicon Valley to help found the technology company Stripe. He is presumed to be rich, but has not filed a financial disclosure form, leadership aides say. Because Ms. Ocasio-Cortez capped her senior aides\u2019 salaries to ensure she could offer an entry-level wage of $52,000, her employees are below the income threshold that mandates public financial disclosure. Instead, a House ethics panel required her to compel at least one of her aides who can \u201cact in the member\u2019s name or with the member\u2019s authority\u201d to file a disclosure form. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez chose Mr. Riffle, the legislative assistant, to submit the disclosure, rather than Mr. Chakrabarti. In March, a conservative group filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission saying that Mr. Chakrabarti improperly disclosed the spending of two political action committees he helped establish that paid more than $1 million in 2016 and 2017 to a company he ran. The company, Brand New Congress L.L.C., was an arm of a group he helped found by the same name that recruited community organizers as candidates who would all adopt the same transformative progressive platform; in turn, the group would contract their staff out to help run the candidates\u2019 campaigns. To do this, Brand New Congress argued, the group had to be set up as a limited liability company \u2014 which is not required to disclose information about its owners or spending. A lawyer for the company has said that Mr. Chakrabarti never received any salary or profit from the company, the political action committees or the campaign, and that the move was legal.",

      "content": " This week, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez made the second political endorsement of her brief career in Congress, bringing her firepower to an ideological soul mate, a 31-year-old lawyer named Tiffany Cab\u00e1n, who is among seven Democratic candidates running for district attorney in Queens. The position is not insignificant. A county of 2.3 million people, Queens is the size of Houston. Richard A. Brown, who died earlier this month, served as district attorney for the past 28 years and ran the office aggressively, as if the days of \u201cMean Streets\u2019\u2019 were still with us. On the left there is a certain enthusiasm for a new approach. Brown\u2019s views were locked into place during his earlier years in law enforcement; on his first day on the job as a Manhattan criminal court judge in 1973, a defendant opened fire in his courtroom, causing him to hide under a bench. \u201cRichard Brown was shaped by the era of broken windows, stop-and-frisk and other policies that led to mass incarceration,\u2019\u2019 Bill Lipton, an early and ardent supporter of Ms. Cab\u00e1n\u2019s and a founder of the Working Families Party, told me. \u201cTiffany is the future.\u2019\u2019 Nearly every other candidate in the race, including Melinda Katz, the Queens borough president who has been the front-runner thus far, could lay claim to that designation as well. All are running as progressives committed to undoing the damages wrought by so many years of needlessly sending young black and Latino men to prison. Ms. Cab\u00e1n distinguishes herself by way of biography. For the past seven years, she has been a public defender in Manhattan, where she has witnessed benighted prosecutorial styles pushing defendants further and further away from the chance of ever gaining their equilibrium. She has seen violent felony charges attached to people who simply stole luggage or Amazon packages from the lobbies of apartment buildings. She watched individuals being sent back to prison over and over because they weren\u2019t getting the help they needed. \u201cRikers is the biggest mental-health hospital in the city,\u2019\u2019 Ms. Cab\u00e1n said, talking about the city\u2019s largest and most infamous jail. Once she had a client who kept getting locked up for short stretches \u2014 30 days here, 60 days there \u2014 all for misdemeanors. He had been physically abused as a child and was prone to getting into fistfights. At a certain point when he landed back in court, a prosecutor demanded that he be sent away for nine months so that he would finally learn his lesson. \u201cI said, \u2018Do you really think the problem is that he doesn\u2019t know that what he is doing is wrong?\u2019\u201d Ms. Cab\u00e1n recalled. She grew angrier at the myopia she saw around her, at the failure of so many prosecutors to understand that trauma is often passed down generationally among people living in poverty. Then, two years ago, Larry Krasner ran for district attorney in Philadelphia. Ms. Cab\u00e1n became obsessed with the race and what it promised, namely a way to abandon fossilized, tough-on-crime rhetoric in favor of calls to upend the system so that harsh consequence and arbitrary punishment were no longer default goals. Mr. Krasner had practiced both criminal defense and civil rights law; he, too, had been a public defender. In his first year as Philadelphia\u2019s district attorney, city prosecutors opened 6,500 fewer cases than they had the previous year, crucially reducing the number of misdemeanor cases filed and making Mr. Krasner a kind of messiah to advocates for criminal-justice reform. Other public defenders have since seen the wisdom of switching sides, so to speak. Last year Genevi\u00e9ve Jones-Wright ran for district attorney in San Diego, arguing that too few of her clients had received recommendations for diversion programs from the district attorney\u2019s office that would keep them out of the courts. She lost to a prosecutor but received the support of George Soros. Currently, Chesa Boudin, San Francisco\u2019s deputy public defender, is running for district attorney there. Mr. Boudin is the son of Kathy Boudin and David Gilbert, members of the Weather Underground who were sent to prison in conjunction with the 1981 Brink\u2019s robbery. He is campaigning in part on the promise that he will reduce high rates of recidivism and help those arrested find jobs and pursue their education. In addition to the backing from Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, Ms. Cab\u00e1n has the advantage of going up against a chief rival who has been a career politician, with all the fustiness that that implies. Ms. Katz has neither been a defense lawyer nor a prosecutor; as a member of the New York State Assembly in the 1990s she voted to reinstate the death penalty, a position she now disavows. Should Ms. Cab\u00e1n win the Democratic primary next month, she would presumably serve as a role model for other young progressives to effect change from the inside. The problem, though, is that vision will get you only so far. The position of district attorney requires running a huge office, staffed with people who have grown set in their ways, often over decades. Mr. Krasner, who is in his 50s, came to the Philadelphia district attorney\u2019s office and quickly fired people. He goes around the country as an evangelist for reform-minded prosecutorial work, often trying to talk aspiring public defenders to embark on his line of work instead. (This has angered some in public-defender circles.) Ms. Cab\u00e1n is young \u2014 she has never had a supervisory role in her defense work. She, or anyone coming in with a like-minded agenda, would need deputies who commanded the respect of whatever lawyers remained among the old guard. If you believe, as many legal scholars do, that the future of criminal-justice reform really lies with prosecutors, then the success of the movement depends on the election of district attorneys who posses a skill, native or acquired, for the comparatively dull business of management. Who is best suited to change institutional culture? Sometimes it is the person who has sat furthest away from it.",

      "content": " (Want to get this briefing by email? Here\u2019s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here\u2019s what you need to know: \u2022 The Supreme Court dealt a major blow to organized labor this morning. By a 5-to-4 vote, with the more conservative justices in the majority, the court ruled that government workers who choose not to join unions cannot be required to help pay for collective bargaining. The ruling means that public-sector unions across the U.S., already under political pressure, could lose tens of millions of dollars and see their effectiveness diminished. But being smaller and poorer doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they\u2019ll be weaker. \u2022 The court based its ruling on the First Amendment, saying that requiring payments to unions that negotiate with the government forces workers to endorse political messages that may be at odds with their beliefs. \u2022 It\u2019s been a busy couple of days for the top court. On Tuesday, it upheld President Trump\u2019s ban on travel from several predominantly Muslim countries, saying on Tuesday that the president\u2019s power to secure U.S. borders was not undermined by the incendiary statements he made about Muslims. The court\u2019s liberals denounced the decision, which Justice Sonia Sotomayor compared to the 1944 ruling that upheld the detention of Japanese-Americans during World War II, Korematsu v. United States. That decision has been almost universally recognized as a shameful mistake, and the court overturned it on Tuesday. \u2022 The 5-to-4 ruling on the travel ban, combined with a separate one on Tuesday in favor of opponents of abortion, validated the Republican strategy of blocking President Barack Obama\u2019s nomination of Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court. Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee, Justice Neil Gorsuch, voted with the majority in both cases. \u2022 A federal judge in California issued a nationwide injunction late Tuesday temporarily stopping the Trump administration from separating children from their parents at the border. Judge Dana Sabraw also ordered that all families already separated be reunited within 30 days. The ruling is likely to lead to a high-profile battle with the Justice Department, and it raises the stakes in what has become a political crisis for the administration. The House is set to vote today on a far-reaching immigration bill that is all but certain to fail. In the Senate, Ted Cruz and Dianne Feinstein have long butted heads, but they\u2019re leading the effort to address family separations at the border. \u2022 President Trump has repeatedly claimed that Democrats want \u201copen borders.\u201d We looked at what they actually support. \u2022 That\u2019s the question on a lot of minds this morning after the 28-year-old political newcomer pulled off a major upset in New York\u2019s Democratic primary on Tuesday. She defeated Representative Joseph Crowley, who had been seen as a possible successor to Nancy Pelosi as the party\u2019s leader in the House. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, a former organizer for Bernie Sanders\u2019s presidential campaign, has declared it time for generational, racial and ideological change. (Mr. Crowley, a 19 year incumbent, is twice her age.) Here\u2019s what we know about the woman who could become the youngest person in Congress. \u2022 The primaries highlighted rebellion among Democrats and rewarded loyalty for Republicans, as two incumbents favored by President Trump won. Here are four takeaways, and full results from the seven states that voted. \u2022 Nicholas Casey was once The Times\u2019s bureau chief in Venezuela, until he was stopped by airport officials a year and a half ago and kicked out of the country. He has returned for a visit, to find out how Venezuelans are holding on as the country falls apart under President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.

      "author": "Emmanuel Saez",
      "content": "  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has kick-started a much-needed debate about taxes. But the debate, so far, has been misplaced. It\u2019s obvious that the affluent \u2014 who\u2019ve seen their earnings boom since 1980 while their taxes fell \u2014 can contribute more to the public coffers. And given the revenue needs of the country, it is necessary. But that\u2019s not the fundamental reason higher top marginal income tax rates are desirable. Their root justification is not about collecting revenue. It is about regulating inequality and the market economy. It is also about safeguarding democracy against oligarchy. It has always been about that. Look at the history of the United States. From 1930 to 1980, the top marginal income tax rate averaged 78 percent; it exceeded 90 percent from 1951 to 1963. What\u2019s important to realize is that these rates applied to extraordinarily high incomes only, the equivalent of more than several million dollars today. Only the ultrarich were subjected to them. In 1960, for example, the top marginal tax rate of 91 percent started biting above a threshold that was nearly 100 times the average national income per adult, the equivalent of $6.7 million in annual income today. The merely rich \u2014 the high-earning professionals, the medium-size company executives, people with incomes in the hundreds of thousands in today\u2019s dollars \u2014 were taxed at marginal rates in a range of 25 percent to 50 percent, in line with what\u2019s typical nowadays (for instance, in states like California and New York, including state income taxes). That few people faced the 90 percent top tax rates was not a bug; it was the feature that caused sky-high incomes to largely disappear. The point of high top marginal income tax rates is to constrain the immoderate, and especially unmerited, accumulation of riches. From the 1930s to the 1980s, the United States came as close as any democratic country ever did to imposing a legal maximum income. The inequality of pretax income shrank dramatically. [Never be uninteresting. Read the most thought-provoking, funny, delightful and raw stories from The New York Times Opinion section.] The view that excessive income concentration corrodes the social contract has deep roots in America \u2014 a country founded, in part, in reaction against the highly unequal, aristocratic Europe of the 18th century. Sharply progressive taxation is an American invention: The United States was the first country in the world, in 1917 \u2014 four years after the creation of the income tax \u2014 to impose tax rates as high as 67 percent on the highest incomes. When Representative Ocasio-Cortez proposes a 70 percent rate for incomes above $10 million, she is reconnecting with this American tradition. She\u2019s reviving an ethos that Ronald Reagan successfully repressed, but that prevailed during most of the 20th century. And she\u2019s doing so at a time when there is an emergency. For just as we have a climate crisis, we have an inequality crisis. Over more than a generation, the lower half of income distribution has been shut out from economic growth: Its income per adult was $16,000 in 1980 (adjusted for inflation), and it still is around $16,000 today. At the same time, the income of a tiny minority has skyrocketed. For the highest 0.1 percent of earners, incomes have grown more than 300 percent; for the top 0.01 percent, incomes have grown by as much as 450 percent. And for the tippy-top 0.001 percent \u2014 the 2,300 richest Americans \u2014 incomes have grown by more than 600 percent. Just as the point of taxing carbon is not to raise revenue but to reduce carbon emissions, high tax rates for sky-high incomes do not aim at funding Medicare for All. They aim at preventing an oligarchic drift that, if left unaddressed, will continue undermining the social compact and risk killing democracy. Of course, there are many policies \u2014 from the enforcement of antitrust laws to a broader access to education; from the regulation of intellectual property to better corporate governance \u2014 that can contribute to curbing inequality in the years to come. And government transfers, whether in the form of income support for families or public health insurance, have a critical role to play. But redistribution alone will not be enough to address the inequality challenge of the 21st century. All societies that have successfully tamed inequality have done so mostly by curbing the concentration of pretax income \u2014 the inequality generated by the markets \u2014 for the simple reason that extreme market inequality undermines the very possibility of redistribution. Tolerating extreme inequality means accepting that it\u2019s not a gross policy failure, not a serious danger to our democratic and meritocratic ideals \u2014 but that it\u2019s fair and just and natural. It produces its own self-justifying ideology. It vindicates the \u201cwinners\u201d of world markets. But vindicated winners, sure of their own legitimacy, seldom share much of their \u201cjust deserts\u201d with the rest of society. An extreme concentration of wealth means an extreme concentration of economic and political power. Although many policies can help address it, progressive income taxation is the fairest and most potent of them all, because it restrains all exorbitant incomes equally, whether they derive from exploiting monopoly power, new financial products, sheer luck or anything else. A common objection to elevated top marginal income tax rates is that they hurt economic growth. But let\u2019s look at the empirical evidence. The United States grew more strongly \u2014 and much more equitably \u2014 from 1946 to 1980 than it has ever since. But maybe in those years the United States, as the hegemon of the post-World War II decades, could afford \u201cbad\u201d tax policy? Let\u2019s look then at Japan in 1945, a poor and war-devastated country. The United States, which occupied Japan after the war, imposed democracy and a top marginal tax rate of 85 percent on it (almost the same rate as at home \u2014 86 percent in 1947). The goal was obviously not to generate much revenue. It was to prevent, from that tabula rasa, the formation of a new oligarchy. This policy was applied for decades: In 1982, the top rate was still 75 percent. Yet between 1950 and 1982, Japan grew at one of the fastest rates ever recorded (5.1 percent a year per adult on average), one of the most striking economic success stories of all time. Contrast Japan in 1945 with Russia in 1991. When Communism fell, Russia was also a poor country, with income and life expectancy well below that of Western economies. In lieu of 85 percent top rates, however, Russians got fast privatization and a top tax rate of 30 percent \u2014 again modeled on what was prevailing in the United States at the time (31 percent in 1991). That rate was replaced in 2001 by an even lower flat rate of 13 percent. That shock therapy created a new oligarchy, led to negative income growth for the bottom half of the population, fostered a general discontent with democracy and produced a drift toward authoritarianism. Progressive income taxation cannot solve all our injustices. But if history is any guide, it can help stir the country in the right direction, closer to Japan and farther from Putin\u2019s Russia. Democracy or plutocracy: That is, fundamentally, what top tax rates are about.",

      "content": " Last Friday, three days after being elected to the House of Representatives, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez invited over 600,000 people to chat as she made loaded macaroni and cheese in an Instant Pot. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat, was streaming on Instagram Live, answering questions submitted through the live chat feature as she grated cheese and sang along to Janelle Mon\u00e1e. It wasn\u2019t too surprising to see her there, as her followers have watched each step of her journey since she announced she would be seeking a congressional seat in April 2017. Over the past week, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez has taken these followers behind the scenes of congressional orientation, as she\u2019s visited monuments, met with other incoming freshmen and looked through the new member directory \u2014 which she joked was like a yearbook. \u201cAt orientation you get a swag bag,\u201d she said in one story, displaying a shopping bag that she explained held her new secure devices. In another, she walked between government buildings, whispering, \u201cGuys, there are secret underground tunnels,\u201d adding in a caption, \u201cJk they\u2019re not secret but it\u2019s cool.\u201d Government officials have always found creative ways to reach their constituents, from President Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s fireside chats to President Trump\u2019s use of Twitter. But Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, who at 29 is the youngest woman ever elected to Congress, is especially good at connecting with her followers on Instagram, which can be a more intimate platform \u2014 especially when a user speaks directly to the camera. The video quality isn\u2019t great, the audio can get muffled and the lighting can be overexposed. But that\u2019s partly the point. Using her cellphone\u2019s forward-facing camera, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez provides civics lessons and discusses her personal highs and lows. The videos seem designed to be accessible to everyone. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez has started using a closed-captioning tool called Clipomatic so that those who are deaf or hard of hearing can follow along. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez is also an active user of Twitter, the preferred clap-back platform. On Thursday, a reporter from the Washington Examiner tweeted a picture of Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s back with the caption, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you something: that jacket and coat don\u2019t look like a girl who struggles.\u201d It was one of several recent attempts by conservative media to portray her as wealthier than she says she is. He later deleted the tweet, but not before Ms. Ocasio-Cortez responded. She replied to her initial tweet with another, tagging the reporter, Eddie Scarry, and including a screenshot of his original tweet. \u201cOh, does @eScarry think he can delete his misogyny without an apology? I don\u2019t think so. You\u2019re a journalist \u2014 readers should know your bias.\u201d And she has company among her fellow incoming freshmen. After Representative-elect Ilhan Omar of Minnesota arrived in Washington this week, she tweeted, \u201cWe did not come to play,\u201d along with a link to a story in The Cut. The headline: \u201cYour Cool New Congresswomen Are Already Hanging Out.\u201d A week earlier, Ms. Omar reacted to Representative-elect Ayanna Pressley\u2019s win in Massachusetts with a Beyonc\u00e9 GIF. Like Snapchat stories, Instagram stories are ephemeral and automatically delete after 24 hours. But users can save stories and pin them to their pages as a \u201chighlight,\u201d allowing followers to watch a story weeks after it was published. Three months ago, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez made an Instagram story in which she spoke about how she was feeling. That story, labeled \u201cPep Talk,\u201d is pinned to the top of her page as a highlight. At one point, she sighed deeply and said, \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be perfect all the time on every issue.\u201d \u201cI think what people forget is if we want everyday, working-class Americans to run for office, and not like these robots, that we have to acknowledge and accept imperfection and growth and humanity in our government,\u201d she added. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez did not respond to requests for an interview. Some have dismissed her Instagram use as merely an example of a young person knowing how to use a platform. But it\u2019s not that simple, said Jennifer Grygiel, an assistant professor at Syracuse University who studies social media. \u201cVery few people can get away with wearing those animated Instagram glasses but also be taken seriously,\u201d Professor Grygiel said. \u201cShe can command both spaces.\u201d In 2018, social media skills are expected of political figures and their teams. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas is a top Instagram user among Republican politicians, with a following of nearly 280,000. But his Instagram presence is distant, filled with professional photography and text cards that do not lend themselves to a sense of authenticity. According to an analysis in The New York Times, the number of interactions on Democrats\u2019 Instagram accounts dwarfed those on Republican accounts within a 30-day period ending Oct. 15. The political tilt of Instagram reflects the demographics of the platform\u2019s users. Instagram users skew younger, as do Democratic voters. One of Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s biggest strengths on Instagram is that she tries to bring her followers into the political process and convince them that they, too, could someday be in her shoes. \u201cWhat she\u2019s saying is, \u2018Hey, develop these skills alongside of me and we will be a community, we\u2019ll be a force,\u2019\u201d Professor Grygiel said. \u201cShe\u2019s not just saying, \u2018Hey, support me, support me, support me.\u2019\u201d",

      "author": "George Gene Gustines",
      "content": " Is Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York the biggest comic book character of 2019? Her story has all the twists of a comic book origin: She\u2019s a former bartender and activist turned congresswoman; she\u2019s a confident public speaker and a social-media whiz  (where she once quoted from the \u201cWatchmen\u201d graphic novel); and she\u2019s a champion for progressive issues and the environment. Readers will be able to decide for themselves where she ranks among their comic book favorites on Wednesday when Issue No. 1 of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the Freshman Force arrives in stores. The tales in this anthology include the absurdist and the hopeful. In one, written by Nick Accardi and drawn by Travis Hymel, the world of politics is transferred to a wrestling ring \u2014 where Ocasio-Cortez participates in a \u201cSenate Slam\u201d against \u201cdiabolical special-interest groups.\u201d She is visited the night before the match by someone who introduces themselves as \u201cNew York\u2019s Greatest Senator.\u201d When she guesses Hillary Clinton, there is an angry response: \u201cNo Dag Nabbit! It\u2019s me Franklin Delano Roosevelt!\u201d Another story, \u201cDance Party USA\u201d by the cartoonist Peter Rostovsky, delves into the question of whether dancing and Democrats mix \u2014 in response to the dance video of Ocasio-Cortez  that surfaced on the internet on the eve of her swearing-in. \u201cObama danced but was too smooth,\u201d Rostovsky writes, while Hillary Clinton \u201cseemed kind of awkward.\u201d He also says that the key to a social movement is to make it enjoyable. \u201cI suggested we look at AOC\u2019s \u2018infamous\u2019 dance video as a promise of things to come,\u201d he writes. \u201cMaybe it\u2019ll be a party if she really gets her way.\u201d The project, from Devil\u2019s Due Comics, received a lot of media attention when it was announced in February. In his foreword, Josh Blaylock, the founder of the company, said he created the comic because he was inspired by Ocasio-Cortez and other newly elected members of Congress. The result is a 52-page book, priced at $5.99, which has pinups, games and stories. The common theme is the potential of the new members of Congress and their \u201cfinally bringing diversity to the legislative body that reflects us as a whole,\u201d Blaylock wrote. The Ocasio-Cortez comic is not the first or last foray into politics by Devil\u2019s Due. Blaylock published \u201cBarack the Barbarian\u201d in 2009. And on July 3, the company will release an anthology dedicated to Bernie Sanders, \u201cTalk Bernie To Me!\u201d \u2014 which is being promoted as \u201canother comic anthology for the 99 percent.\u201d Comic books and politics have a colorful past. President Ronald Reagan was the subject of a 2007 graphic-novel biography. The next year, Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain made an appearance in a Marvel comic, and IDW Publishing presented biographical comics about Senators John McCain and Barack Obama a month before Election Day. TidalWave Productions has a regular \u201cFemale Force\u201d series of comics that tell the life stories of Hillary Clinton, Sarah Palin, Michelle Obama, Condoleezza Rice and others. The company also released \u201cDonald Trump: The Graphic Novel\u201d as part of its \u201cPolitical Power\u201d series and is publishing a biographical comic on Ocasio-Cortez in August. President Trump is a regular subject of the artist Jon McNaughton, who has been painting for about four decades but whose work turned to politics in 2008, when he painted John McCain. But it was \u201cOne Nation Under God\u201d (2009), which showed Jesus Christ holding a copy of the Constitution, that brought him a lot of exposure. \u201cThis was when the internet was just starting to come on pretty strong, and it went viral because somebody was making fun of it,\u201d Naughton said in a telephone interview. Then the tide turned. \u201cI\u2019ve come to kind of get used to the fact that half the country loves my paintings and the other half hates them.\u201d Similarly McNaughton\u2019s paintings of the president tend to take a positive view of him. One painting, \u201cNational Emergency,\u201d about the immigration debate, depicts President Trump on one side opposed by Ocasio-Cortez and others. He normally would not paint such a new congresswoman, he said, but \u201cshe was an interesting enough character to put in.\u201d In February, when a reporter for TMZ asked Ocasio-Cortez about her comic book debut, she said she was appreciative that a portion of all sales will go to RaicesTexas.org, which provides free and low-cost legal services to immigrant children, families and refugees. The reporter also asked Ocasio-Cortez what it felt like to be depicted as a superhero. \"I\u2019m just a normal person, doing her best,\u201d she said. She added that her comic-book character might inspire young girls, showing them that \"we all have a superhero inside of us.\"",

      "content": " She has never held elected office. She is still paying off her student loans. She is 28 years old. \u201cWomen like me aren\u2019t supposed to run for office,\u201d Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said in a viral campaign video released last month. They certainly weren\u2019t supposed to win. But in a stunning upset Tuesday night that ignited the New York and national political worlds, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, a Bronx-born community organizer and member of the Democratic Socialists of America, defeated Representative Joseph Crowley, a 19-year incumbent and Queens political stalwart who had not faced a primary challenger in 14 years. Mr. Crowley, who is twice Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s age, is the No. 4 Democrat in the House of Representatives and had been favored to ascend to the speaker\u2019s lectern if Democrats retook the lower chamber this fall. If Ms. Ocasio-Cortez defeats the Republican candidate, Anthony Pappas, in the predominantly Democratic district in November, she would dethrone Elise Stefanik, a Republican representative from upstate New York, as the youngest woman ever elected to Congress (Ms. Stefanik was 30 when she took office in 2015). \u201cI\u2019m an organizer in this community, and I knew living here and being here and seeing and organizing with families here, that it was possible,\u201d a visibly shocked Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said in an interview at her victory party on Tuesday. \u201cI knew that it was long odds, and I knew that it was uphill, but I always knew it was possible.\u201d [Read more on Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s major Democratic upset] The daughter of a Puerto Rican mother and a Bronx-born father, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez earned a degree in economics and international relations from Boston University but worked as a waitress and bartender after graduating in 2011 to supplement her mother\u2019s income as a house cleaner and bus driver, according to The Intercept. Her father, a small-business owner, had died three years earlier of cancer; after his death, her family fought foreclosure and her mother and grandmother eventually moved to Florida. She dabbled in establishment politics during college, working for Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, on immigration issues, but soon turned her attention to the grass-roots work that would come to define her candidacy. Returning to the Bronx after graduation, she began advocating improved childhood education and literacy, starting a children\u2019s book publishing company that sought to portray her home borough in a positive light, according to a 2012 article in The New York Daily News. The importance of education had been instilled in her from a young age: As a child, she was sent to school in Yorktown in Westchester County because of the dearth of quality schools in the Bronx. She returned to national politics when she worked as an organizer for the 2016 presidential campaign of Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont. But even then, the idea of one day seeking office herself seemed unattainable. \u201cI never really saw myself running on my own,\u201d she told New York magazine this month. \u201cI counted out that possibility because I felt that possibility had counted out me. I felt like the only way to effectively run for office is if you had access to a lot of wealth, high social influence, a lot of dynastic power, and I knew that I didn\u2019t have any of those things.\u201d But if Ms. Ocasio-Cortez has, overnight, become the face of progressives\u2019 hopes for ousting not only Republicans but also moderate Democrats who they see as insufficiently outraged about President Trump, her bid against Mr. Crowley predates the anti-Trump backlash that has fueled what many see as a \u201cblue wave\u201d across the country. She has credited her decision to seek office with her experience protesting at the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in 2016 against the Dakota Access Pipeline. Soon after, she was contacted by Brand New Congress, a newly formed progressive organization that asked her to run. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, who has called for Medicare for all, tuition-free public colleges and the abolition of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, made her underdog status the central pillar of her upstart campaign. In her bid against Mr. Crowley, she was unafraid to foreground race, gender, age and class. When Mr. Crowley sent a Latina surrogate to debate Ms. Ocasio-Cortez last week, citing scheduling conflicts, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez blasted him on Twitter for sending someone with a \u201cslight resemblance to me.\u201d She attacked Mr. Crowley for taking corporate money, for not living in the district and for looking increasingly unlike the constituents of the Bronx and Queens he was elected to represent. \u201cThese communities have been so ignored,\u201d she said in an interview with The New York Times earlier this month. \u201cWhat other leaders or what other choices does this community even have? For me, I just feel like it\u2019s a responsibility to show up for this community.\u201d She has joined activists in Flint, Mich., calling for safe drinking water, and traveled to the Mexican border this past weekend to protest family separations of migrants. Like Mr. Sanders, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez made her rejection of corporate donations and reliance on small donors a rallying cry for supporters; nearly 70 percent of her campaign funds came from individual contributions under $200. [Our Politics editor is answering readers\u2019 questions about our political coverage. Submit your questions here.] \u201cNot all Democrats are the same,\u201d she said in her May campaign video, adding \u2014 her voice rising with emotion \u2014 that a Democrat who \u201cdoesn\u2019t send his kids to our schools, doesn\u2019t drink our water or breathe our air cannot possibly represent us.\u201d \u201cCongress is too old,\u201d she told a reporter from the website Elite Daily. \u201cThey don\u2019t have a stake in the game.\u201d Before Tuesday\u2019s victory catapulted her to the front of the political conversation, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez seemed to find readier audiences with outlets such as Elite Daily, Mic or Refinery29 \u2014 websites most often associated with millennial and female audiences \u2014 than with traditional publications. That is about to change. \u201cI\u2019m hoping that this is a beginning,\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said at her victory party on Tuesday. \u201cThat we can continue this organizing and continue what we\u2019ve learned.\u201d Still, shock seemed to be the predominant emotion at Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s party on Tuesday. \u201cOh my God, oh my God,\u201d she said as she realized she had won, her hands flying to her mouth and her eyes widening. Throughout the night, as more and more people flooded into the packed Bronx pool hall, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez was trailed by a swarm of reporters, supporters and campaign staff clamoring for hugs, selfies or just a glimpse of the woman behind a feat many had considered impossible. She added, \u201cI hope that this reminds us of what the Democratic Party should be about, which is, first and foremost, accountability from the working-class people.\u201d",

      "content": " [Want to get New York Today by email? Here's the sign-up.] It\u2019s Tuesday. Tomorrow, spring officially begins. Weather: Grab the sunglasses. It\u2019ll be sunny today and tomorrow. Temperatures start in the mid-30s, then climb to the upper 40s. Alternate-side parking: In effect until Wednesday (suspended Thursday for Purim). When Amazon announced last month that it was canceling plans to build a major campus in Queens, the company did not directly blame any one person or group. But others have. Governor Cuomo, who with Mayor de Blasio helped negotiate the deal largely in private, blamed the State Senate, where crucial leaders opposed the plan. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who opposed the campus, blamed Amazon for seeking $3 billion in tax breaks and incentives that she said should have been spent elsewhere. Now a poll is offering insight into how the public feels about the deal\u2019s collapse. Over a third of New Yorkers point the finger at Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, according to a Siena College Research Institute survey of 700 voters. Here\u2019s what else you need to know about the poll, which was released yesterday: The deal was popular across the state: Two-thirds of voters said Amazon\u2019s withdrawal was bad for New York. Sixty-three percent of Democrats and 56 percent of self-identified liberals said the cancellation was bad for New York. Sixty-four percent of New York City voters agreed with them. Blame fell on Ms. Ocasio-Cortez: Thirty-eight percent of voters faulted the congresswoman for the deal\u2019s demise, identifying her as a \u201cvillain.\u201d \u201cLocal activists in Queens\u201d were labeled villains by 34 percent of voters. In the New York City suburbs, 50 percent of voters blamed Ms. Ocasio-Cortez. Upstate, the number was 40 percent; in the five boroughs, it was 29 percent. A spokesman for Ms. Ocasio-Cortez declined to comment on the poll results. What about the governor and mayor? Mr. Cuomo and Mr. de Blasio were each seen as a villain by fewer than 30 percent of voters. What about Amazon? The company was blamed by 26 percent of voters. The takeaways: \u2022 The progressive base that cheered Ms. Ocasio-Cortez as she railed against the deal was not representative of most voters. \u201cThose closest to a project don\u2019t necessarily reflect the views of a wider audience,\u201d said Steven Greenberg, a pollster with Siena College. (I asked Mr. Greenberg if by \u201cclosest\u201d he meant physical proximity, and he replied, \u201cYes.\u201d) \u2022 \u201cLocal activists in Queens\u201d were blamed more often for the plan\u2019s demise than the State Senate was. In the suburbs, 39 percent of voters labeled the activists as villains, but only 23 percent labeled the Senate as such. This matters in part because Democrats need to retain suburban seats to hold on to their Senate majority. The poll   was conducted March 10-14 and has a margin of error of 4.2 percentage points.

New Yorkers \u201chad connections to the case \u2014 parents, uncles, aunts, grandparents,\u201d Professor Weisberg said. \u201cIt\u2019s a story of how a couple that owns a ma-and-pa electronic fix-it store becomes swept up in the web of an investigation,\u201d Professor Weisberg said. \u201cAnd there are so many unresolved issues, even the guilt and innocence of both Julius and Ethel \u2014 who should be seen separately, really in a way \u2014 is unclear at the moment.\u201d The case is more than 60 years old, but some at Cardozo say it shouldn\u2019t be forgotten. Today at 4 p.m., the law school will screen a movie about the Rosenbergs called \u201cDaniel,\u201d which the executive producers have described as \u201cinspired\u201d by the case. At 6:30 p.m., an actress in the film, Lindsay Crouse, will participate in a discussion with one of the Rosenbergs\u2019 sons, Robert Meeropol. The discussion will be moderated by Professor Weisberg. Ms. Crouse said the case was long overdue for a re-examination. \u201cOne of the reasons I think it\u2019s important for students to know what went on in the Rosenberg case is that this country has almost shunned the case,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s very upsetting on many levels, and we need to look at it square in the face to learn its lessons.\u201d Barbara Kolson, the co-director of the Fashion, Arts, Media and Entertainment Center at Cardozo, who helped organize the event, said the school\u2019s students \u201cdid not know who the Rosenbergs were.\u201d \u201cThey also did not know who Roy Cohn was,\u201d she said, referring to one of the prosecutors who was instrumental in the convictions. Mr. Cohn, who died in 1986, had mentored a cadre of influential people, including President Trump and Roger Stone. It\u2019s Tuesday \u2014 learn about New York history. Dear Diary: I was walking down York Avenue after a discouraging second day at my first job. Feeling overwhelmed, I was holding back tears as I trudged home through the rain. A few blocks from my apartment, I slowed to a stop in front of a fruit cart. I pretended to scan the contents as I replayed the previous eight hours in my head. The vendor tried to tempt me with cherries and tangerines, but I was lost in my own thoughts. I heard a voice whispering from behind me: \u201cGet the grapes.\u201d I turned to face a woman with gentle features and streaks of gray hair, her body wrapped tightly in a fur coat. \u201cThey\u2019re sweet and delicious,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd you can put them in your pocket and eat them on your way home.\u201d So I did. And they were. \u2014 Michael Harmon Metropolitan Diary was inadvertently left out of the Monday edition of New York Today, so we are publishing two today. Dear Diary: We were apart for seven months. He was in Alabama, at Fort Rucker, and I was at Columbia. We spent three days together while he was on leave. The day before he left, we were on the No. 1. In the twitching subway light, a band swung into our car and seasoned the tight air: One musician kneaded a metallic accordion, and another sang. He smiled \u2014 there is a slight gap between his front teeth \u2014 and we danced. In the music, the moment felt infinite. I didn\u2019t think about saying goodbye, about the distance from Alabama to New York. I just thought about him, on the No. 1, with me, swinging to the music. The next day he boarded his train at Penn Station. I walked to Times Square, crying and cold, and I caught the No. 1. After two stops, a band swung into the car: It was the one from the day before. I couldn\u2019t help but smile and swing my hips to the music. \u2014 Emma O\u2019Leary New York Today is published weekdays around 6 a.m. Sign up here to get it by email.

      "author": "Thomas B. Edsall",
      "content": " The most active wing of the Democratic Party \u2014 the roughly 20 percent of the party\u2019s electorate that votes in primaries and wields disproportionate influence over which issues get prioritized \u2014 has moved decisively to the left. With all the attention that is being paid to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ayanna Pressley, Rashida Tlaib and other new progressive voices in Congress, this may not seem like news, but we are only just beginning to realize the full significance of this shift. The Primaries Project at the Brookings Institution conducted extensive polling of 7,198 Democratic voters in the 2018 primaries and found that 60.4 percent described themselves as liberal, including 26.4 percent who said they were \u201cvery liberal.\u201d In its most recent analysis, Gallup found that from 1994 to 2018, the percentage of all Democrats who call themselves liberal more than doubled from 25 percent to 51 percent. Over the same period, the percentage of Democratic moderates and conservatives fell steadily, with the share of moderates dropping from 48 to 34 percent, and of conservatives dropping from 25 to 13 percent. These trends began to accelerate during the administration of George W. Bush and have continued unabated during the Obama and Trump presidencies. In recent years, the internal pressures to hew to the left, driven largely by Democratic primary voters, have steadily gained strength. They include the determination to oppose all things Trump, especially his anti-immigrant policies, his racism and his religious bigotry; the rise of outspoken, well-educated liberals, many of them young; the #MeToo movement and Trump\u2019s disrespect for women; the Occupy movement; the mobilization of anti-establishment voters by Bernie Sanders during the 2016 primaries; and the consistent exodus of more conservative white voters from the Democratic Party, supplanted by more politically liberal minority voters. The anti-establishment faction contributed significantly to the large turnout increases in Democratic primaries last year. Pew found that from 2014 to 2018, turnout in House primaries rose from 13.7 to 19.6 percent of all registered Democrats, in Senate primaries from 16.6 to 22.2 percent and in governor primaries from 17.1 to 24.5 percent. Isabel Sawhill, a senior fellow at Brookings, agrees with the analysis that core voters and activist leaders within the party are \u201cmoving leftward\u201d: These \u201cbig, bold leftist ideas\u201d pose a strategic problem for liberals and the Democratic Party, Sawhill, who published \u201cThe Forgotten Americans: An Economic Agenda for a Divided Nation\u201d last year, wrote in an email: Sawhill argues that if the goal of Democrats is victory, as opposed to ideological purity, they must focus on general election swing voters who are not die-hard Democrats. One key Democratic target, Sawhill observes, is the \u201cwell-educated, suburban women, many of them Republican, who voted for Democrats in the midterms.\u201d Once Trump is gone, she continued, \u201cthey could easily return to their natural home in the Republican Party.\u201d \u201cOver the longer-term,\u201d Sawhill continued, The extensive support among prospective Democratic presidential candidates for Medicare for All, government-guaranteed jobs and a higher minimum wage reflects the widespread desire in the electorate for greater protection from the vicissitudes of market capitalism \u2014 in response to \u201cincreasingly incomplete risk protection in an era of dramatic social change,\u201d as the political scientist Jacob Hacker put it in \u201cPrivatizing Risk without Privatizing the Welfare State: The Hidden Politics of Social Policy Retrenchment in the United States.\u201d Support for such protections is showing signs of becoming a litmus test for candidates running in the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries. Polling by the Pew Research Center shows sharp movement in a progressive direction on key issues among many Democrats. Take liberalized attitudes on immigration as an example. From 2008 to 2018, the percentage of Democrats who said the government should create \u201ca way for immigrants already here illegally to become citizens if the meet certain requirements\u201d grew from 29 to 51 percent, while the share who said \u201cthere should be better border security and stronger enforcement of immigration laws\u201d fell from 21 to 5 percent. Similarly, the percentage of Democrats who agreed with the statement that \u201cracial discrimination is the main reason many blacks can\u2019t get ahead these days\u201d rose from 28 to 64 percent from 2010 to 2017. Paul Starr, a sociology professor at Princeton, warns against putting too much stock in the ascendance of progressive Democrats. In an essay in the American Prospect, Starr argues that there were \u201ctwo distinct developments\u201d in the 2018 elections: In addition, while acknowledging the rise of the progressive wing, Starr pointed out that a separate December 2018 Gallup survey found that 54 percent of Democratic voters would prefer their party to become \u201cmore moderate,\u201d while 41 percent said they would like the party to become \u201cmore liberal.\u201d Along similarly cautionary lines, David Graham wrote in the Atlantic last November: Graham\u2019s conclusion: Matt Grossmann, a political scientist at Michigan State, noted in an email that the leftward Women, according to Grossmann, \u201care becoming a bigger part of the Democratic electorate and more supportive of women primary candidates.\u201d The 2018 primary elections revealed the deepening strength of an anti-establishment insurgent faction, largely young, white and minority urban voters who turned out in droves in Democratic primaries from Omaha to Tallahassee and from the Bronx to Boston. Michael Capuano, a former mayor of Somerville, Mass. and a ten-term member of the House, learned the hard way how much the Democratic electorate has changed. As mayor in the 1990s, Capuano presided over the gentrification of the once scruffy, working class town. Initially, the city was grateful. When Capuano first won election to Congress in 1998, he owed his victory in the 10-candidate Democratic primary to his hometown. He carried Somerville with 7,852 votes, more than the total vote for all nine opponents, 6,253, while losing to other candidates in Boston, Belmont, Cambridge, Chelsea and Watertown. The impact of gentrification is striking. By 2017, 61.2 percent of Somerville\u2019s residents 25 or older had at least a bachelor\u2019s degree, compared with 30.9 percent nationwide. The median household income was $84,722, compared with $57,652 nationally. Somerville had moved from downscale to upscale, not to the level of Brattle Street in Cambridge or Boston\u2019s Beacon Hill, but still many steps up the ladder. In the process, Somerville left Capuano, a white working class Democrat in the mold of Tip O\u2019Neill, behind. In 2018, twenty years after first winning his House seat, Capuano could no longer count on Somerville. Despite his deep roots \u2014 his father had been mayor before him \u2014 the vote there was a wash. Capuano received 8,423 to 8,286 for his opponent, Ayanna Pressley, an African-American Boston city councilwomen. Pressley swept Cambridge and Boston to crush Capuano, 60,046 to 42,430 districtwide. The same pattern emerged in the widely publicized defeat of Joe Crowley, another 10-term incumbent, by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in the Democratic primary in a House district that straddles the Bronx and Queens. Steven Romalewski, who runs the mapping service at the CUNY Center for Urban Research, wrote me by email that \u201cOcasio-Cortez did best in areas such as Astoria/Steinway and Sunnyside, which happen to be more white than other parts of the district,\u201d a point he elaborated upon in a story quoting him posted on The Intercept: Grace Segers, writing in July on the City & State website, noted that Crowley David Freedlander, writing in Politico Magazine, captured the unanticipated voting patterns that gave rise to Crowley\u2019s defeat. \u201cOcasio-Cortez\u2019s best precincts,\u201d Freedlander wrote, were Conversely, Crowley did best in \u201cthe working-class African-American enclave of LeFrak City, where he got more than 60 percent of the vote.\u201d In fact, Crowley Jerry Skurnik, a New York political consultant, describes gentrifying communities outside Manhattan as experiencing an influx of \u201cpeople who really want to live in Greenwich Village but can\u2019t afford to.\u201d This younger, well-educated constituency \u2014 predominately but not exclusively white \u2014 is hostile to cautious establishment Democrats, especially to older white men, and they are determined to engineer an intraparty cultural and ideological insurgency. The emergence in force in 2018 of these insurgent Democrats grows in part out of the Sanders presidential campaign. Sanders mobilized millions of voters, many of whom did not want the Democrats to nominate a candidate with deep ties to party regulars and to the major donor community. Maps of primary voting patterns in 2016 and 2018 produced by CUNY\u2019s Graduate School of Journalism and the Center for Urban Research show that Sanders beat Clinton in just a handful of New York City neighborhoods. Many of those Sanders neighborhoods are in Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s district and they are the communities that provided her biggest margins of victory. Sanders also carried Somerville in 2016, 12,247 to 9,016, where support for Capuano imploded two years later. If the turnout patterns in the Ocasio-Cortez and Pressley districts are even modestly predictive, the Democratic Party may be changing in significant ways. Tom Kiley, who conducted polling for Capuano, described in an email the shifting makeup of the Democratic electorate in the Seventh District of Massachusetts: Pressley\u2019s base, Kiley wrote, While the Boston-Cambridge-Somerville district is far more liberal than the national average, Kiley argued that trends there are likely to be replicated in many regions of the country. \u201cThese new voters will have a major impact in the Democratic nomination process in many states,\u201d he wrote: While primary voters are normally predominately committed partisans with a long history of voting, in the Pressley-Capuano contest more than half of the voters had no record of previous primary voting (24 percent) or were recorded as voting in only one previous primary (29 percent). \u201cIf the Pressley campaign was banking on turnout, they certainly cashed in,\u201d wrote Maeve Duggan, research director at the MassINC Polling Group, in an article posted on the website of WBUR, Boston\u2019s NPR news station. \u201cSome 106,556 voters in the 7th Congressional District cast ballots in the 2018 Democratic primary, compared with just 61,725 in 2014,\u201d she continued, \u201cand among the district\u2019s 2018 primary voters, only 37 percent had also voted\u201d in 2014 primaries, according to voter file analysis. Duggan and the MassINC Polling Group analyzed the demographics of the first-time voters and found: The surge of young voters had a powerful impact, increasing The new voters, she found, \u201cwere more likely to be Asian or Hispanic, compared with the 7th\u2019s repeat voters,\u201d but, she noted, the state\u2019s only majority-minority congressional district \u201cstill has a predominantly white voting base.\u201d A July 2018 pre-election survey of voters in the Capuano-Pressley district conducted by WBUR-MassINC makes clear the importance of growing political participation among young voters. The survey found striking generational differences not only on the candidates but on issues. 18-to-29-year-olds favored Pressley over Capuano 41-23 while those over 60 backed Capuano 59-28. Asked if they would be more or less likely to support a candidate who \u201cmade abolishing ICE a major priority,\u201d young voters said \u201cmore likely\u201d by 48-18 while older voters said it would make them \u201cless likely\u201d by 25-23. Both young and old supported a national health care program, but the margin of support versus oppose was larger (90-2) among young voters than among their elders (71-16). In a postelection analysis of the Ocasio-Cortez-Crowley contest, the Global Strategy Group found: At the same time, according to their analysis, voters Crowley thought he could depend upon \u2014 \u201cexpected people, especially older primary voters \u2014 did not show up.\u201d Joshua M. Zeitz, a historian whose most recent book is \u201cBuilding the Great Society: Inside Lyndon Johnson\u2019s White House,\u201d argues that contemporary Democratic progressives are not insurgents, but in full accord with party tradition. In an essay in Politico, \u201cDemocrats Aren\u2019t Moving Left. They\u2019re Returning to Their Roots,\u201d Zeitz argued that Sawhill looks at the ideological shifts in the Democratic electorate less from a historical perspective and more as a response to contemporary economic and social dislocation. Among both conservatives and liberals, Sawhill argued, there is \u201can intellectual awakening about the flaws of modern capitalism\u201d \u2014 a recognition of the failings of \u201cneoliberalism, the idea that a market economy with a few light guardrails is the best way to organize a society.\u201d This intellectual climate may result in greater receptivity among voters to more radical proposals. The willingness of voters to support Democrats who are pushing initiatives like these will depend in large part, however, on the ability of candidates to assure the general electorate that their agenda is beneficial to all and not just to favored liberal constituencies. This will be difficult, given the fact that what is being proposed is a much larger role for government, and that those who are most in need of government support are in the bottom half of the income distribution and disproportionately minority \u2014 in a country with a long racist history. As a presidential candidate, Barack Obama was able to overcome this barrier twice, but the challenge should not be minimized.",

      "content": " CONCORD, N.H. \u2014 Tensions between Joseph R. Biden Jr. and other Democrats over his stance on climate change have escalated this week, after Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez lashed out at \u201cmiddle ground\u201d approaches to the issue in a thinly veiled criticism of the former vice president. Her comments prompted a rebuke on Tuesday from Mr. Biden, who said in response to a question that she should \u201clook at my record\u201d as he once again defended himself against accusations from within his party that he would adopt too moderate a position on an urgent global problem. The dispute represents a striking display of the divisions between the center and the left of the Democratic Party, embodied in the quintessential Beltway veteran, Mr. Biden, and the progressive newcomer, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez. Mr. Biden has been under fire from his party\u2019s left flank, including from Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and several of his presidential rivals, after a Reuters report last week in which Mr. Biden was described as seeking a middle ground to combat climate change. His campaign has said the report mischaracterized his position, and on Tuesday morning he directly answered some of the criticism. \u201cYou\u2019ve never heard me say \u2018middle of the road,\u2019 I\u2019ve never been middle of the road on the environment,\u201d Mr. Biden said when asked to respond to comments Ms. Ocasio-Cortez issued the night before. \u201cAnd, tell her to check, you know, the statement that I made and look at my record, she\u2019ll find that nobody has been more consistent about taking on the environment and the green revolution than I have.\u201d Those remarks came in response to a reporter who read aloud some of Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s comments, which she made Monday night at a rally in support of a sweeping environmental proposal known as the Green New Deal. After listing a series of past abuses related to the environment, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez issued what was widely interpreted as an indictment of Mr. Biden. \u201cI will be damned if the same politicians who refused to act then are going to try to come back today and say we need a middle-of-the-road approach to save our lives,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is too much for me.\u201d In style and on many policy issues, Mr. Biden is campaigning as a centrist in a sprawling field that features a number of candidates from the progressive left, who are advocating substantive change. He said recently that he did not believe the Democratic electorate had moved as far left as many in the party assume. During his New Hampshire swing this week, Mr. Biden pledged to release more details on his environmental proposals by the end of the month, and detailed his record on combating climate change dating to the 1980s. He also spent time, both in conversations with reporters and unprompted on the stump, casting himself as a longtime champion of the environment and defending his record on climate change, a key issue to many progressive voters. Pressed on whether his future policies would be sufficiently bold for progressives, Mr. Biden expressed confidence: \u201cYeah I do, I do,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a long campaign,\u201d he went on. \u201cAnd everybody should, they should calm down a little bit. Take a look at the record. There\u2019s nothing middle-of-the-road about my efforts dealing with the environment. Nothing.\u201d",

      "content": " Two police officers in Gretna, La., were fired on Monday, four days after one of them referred to Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as a \u201cvile idiot\u201d on social media and suggested that she should be shot. Chief Arthur Lawson of the Gretna Police Department announced the terminations, saying that Charles Rispoli, the officer who wrote the Facebook post, and Angelo Varisco, who liked the post online, had violated the department\u2019s social media policy. \u201cThis incident, we feel, has been an embarrassment to our department,\u201d Chief Lawson said at a news conference. \u201cThese officers have certainly acted in a manner which was unprofessional, alluding to a violent act to be conducted against a sitting U.S. congressman, a member of our government. We\u2019re not going to tolerate that.\u201d Mr. Rispoli, a 14-year veteran of the Police Department, said in a Facebook post on Thursday that Ms. Ocasio-Cortez \u201cneeds a round \u2014 and I don\u2019t mean the kind she used to serve,\u201d a reference to her past work as a bartender, according to a screenshot of the comment obtained by The Times-Picayune of New Orleans. Mr. Varisco joined the department in 2016. In the screenshot, his name can be seen as one of four who reacted to the post, either with a laughing face emoji or a thumbs-up. Neither Mr. Rispoli nor Mr. Varisco could be reached for comment on Monday evening. \u201cI applaud the investigation,\u201d Belinda Constant, the mayor of Gretna, said in an interview. \u201cI think it was done appropriately, it was done expeditiously, and it absolutely was the right decision.\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York, is a self-described democratic socialist and has been a strong critic of President Trump. She is one of four first-year female Democrats in the House \u2014 three of whom were born in the United States \u2014 who were told by Mr. Trump to \u201cgo back\u201d to their countries in a Twitter post last week. A representative of Ms. Ocasio-Cortez declined to comment on Monday night. Chief Lawson said he had trouble understanding Mr. Rispoli\u2019s post, especially since the article he shared \u2014 which claimed that Ms. Ocasio-Cortez had said soldiers were paid too much \u2014 was satirical. \u201cI think he just got caught up in the heat of the moment,\u201d Chief Lawson said. \u201cAnd this wasn\u2019t even a real news article.\u201d Neither officer had patrolled the streets, Chief Lawson said. He said Mr. Varisco had provided security for the courts, and Mr. Rispoli had also worked in the courts before he began supervising \u201cindividuals who were in the home incarceration program.\u201d The action against the officers in Louisiana came at a time of increased scrutiny of police officers\u2019 activity on social media. Last month, researchers with the Plain View Project released a compilation of troubling posts made by public safety officers. They examined eight police departments across the country and found that \u2014 of the Facebook profiles they could verify \u2014 about one in five current officers, including many in supervisory roles, and more than two in five former officers used content that was misogynist, racist, Islamophobic or otherwise biased, or that undermined the concept of due process. The project spawned investigations and repercussions in Philadelphia, Phoenix, St. Louis and elsewhere. Chief Lawson said that Gretna police officers had been trained and made aware of other episodes across the country in which officials had gotten into trouble for inappropriate social media posts. \u201cWith all of those efforts, something like this still happens,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s very disturbing. It certainly shows a lack of the officers paying attention to what\u2019s going on in the world around them.\u201d",

Somebody snapped a picture, and one of them \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez \u2014 posted it on Instagram with a one-word caption: \u201cSquad.\u201d Today, that foursome \u2014 Representatives Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ayanna S. Pressley of Massachusetts, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan \u2014 may be Washington\u2019s best-known political clique. But their forceful brand of progressive politics and command of the spotlight rankles some fellow Democrats, including the most important Democrat in Washington: Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who on Friday appeared to make peace with Ms. Ocasio-Cortez \u2014 at least for now. \u201cIn a family, you have your differences, but you\u2019re still family,\u201d Ms. Pelosi told reporters after the two met privately for 30 minutes, at Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s request. She acknowledged \u201csome personality issues\u201d in the caucus, but called them \u201cminor.\u201d Lionized by the liberal left and vilified by President Trump \u2014 who is waging a relentless campaign to attack them as anti-American \u2014 Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and the others roared into Washington in January as part of the most diverse freshman class in American history, and quickly emerged as a proxy for the debate over the future of the Democratic Party, exposing its ideological and generational divisions. Tensions between the quartet and Ms. Pelosi erupted into public view this month amid a fight over humanitarian aid to the border. The women blasted the aid package as insufficient and voted against it. Ms. Pelosi dismissed them as \u201cfour people\u201d who \u201cdidn\u2019t have any following.\u201d Then Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and her chief of staff, Saikat Chakrabarti, took shots at the speaker on Twitter \u2014 a stunning breach of protocol for a young lawmaker and an unelected aide. Ms. Omar infuriated many veteran Democrats this year with remarks many deemed anti-Semitic. Ms. Tlaib took the party off course on Day 1 with her off-color promise to impeach Mr. Trump. But fences are being mended. Ms. Omar is joining Ms. Pelosi on an official trip next week to Ghana. Ms. Tlaib appeared at a fund-raiser with Ms. Pelosi over the weekend; when the speaker was in Detroit on Monday, she was greeted by protesters chanting, \u201cSupport the squad!\u201d They do not always vote the same way. Ms. Pressley broke with the others this week to vote for a resolution condemning the boycott Israel movement. Just two of them \u2014 Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and Ms. Tlaib \u2014 voted for a two-year spending package that passed on Thursday. But people close to the women say they have forged genuine friendships and a close bond. They communicate regularly via a private text chain, as do their chiefs of staff and their communications directors. On occasion, their offices plot strategy together and coordinate media appearances, including a joint news conference last week and an interview with Gayle King of CBS News to push back against Mr. Trump. All declined interviews for this article. \u201cWhat we are, are four women who have an alignment of values, shared policy priorities, who have repeatedly happened to land in the same place on the issue of immigration,\u201d Ms. Pressley, who keeps the lowest profile of the four, told Ms. King. \u201cThat is it. There is no insurgency here. There\u2019s nothing conspiratorial.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks \u2014 in a tweet this month he told the women to \u201cgo back\u201d to their home countries, even though only one of them, Ms. Omar, a Somali refugee, was born outside the United States \u2014 prompted Democrats to rally around them. The House voted to condemn the president\u2019s comments as racist, and even moderates like Representative C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger, a centrist from Maryland who had trouble remembering Ms. Omar\u2019s name, stood behind them. \u201cI said, \u2018Look, you don\u2019t know me; we\u2019ve only met once or twice,\u201d Mr. Ruppersberger said, recounting a conversation with Ms. Omar after Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet. \u201cBut I can tell you this: \u2018I\u2019m behind you 100 percent.\u2019\u201d Still, Mr. Ruppersberger said he and other moderates were wary of the women, fearing they would push primary challengers to run against them. And while progressives view the four as some of the most exciting figures in the Democratic Party, they did not make a good impression with some of their more senior colleagues when they showed up for work in January. \u201cI think when the new generation comes in, sometimes they don\u2019t understand what it is to be in the majority,\u201d Mr. Ruppersberger said. All four landed in Washington as firsts. Ms. Pressley, 45, a former member of the Boston City Council, is the first black woman to represent Massachusetts; Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, 29, a former bartender and onetime organizer for Senator Bernie Sanders, is the youngest woman ever elected to Congress and the first Latina to represent her district. Ms. Omar, 36, is a former state legislator and the first woman to wear a hijab on the House floor. She and Ms. Tlaib, 43, a lawyer and former state legislator who is of Palestinian descent, are the first two Muslim women in Congress. Both have been the subject of fierce criticism for their views on Israel. The four are the only freshmen elected with the backing of Justice Democrats, a grass-roots organizing group that burst onto the scene last year after helping Ms. Ocasio-Cortez with her stunning primary defeat of Joe Crowley, the No. 4 Democratic leader. During the campaign, some of them connected through social media, and after Ms. Ocasio-Cortez won her primary, she helped the others. \u201cThese are four women of color who speak truth to power, who do not want to maintain the status quo and are going to fight like hell, like they have nothing to lose, for the biggest solutions to some of our biggest problems,\u201d Alexandra Rojas, Justice Democrats\u2019s executive director, said in an interview. \u201cThey are all doing exactly what they said they were going to be doing on the campaign trail.\u201d Although the four women share political ideology, they also came together in part because of happenstance. A bipartisan group called VoteRunLead, which trains women to run for office and was meeting in New York, asked the women to sit for a joint Facebook Live interview when they were in Washington after the 2018 midterm elections, when the photo posted on Instagram of them was taken. VoteRunLead\u2019s founder, Erin Vilardi, said she would have included another progressive woman of color \u2014 Representative Lauren Underwood of Illinois \u2014 in the interview, had Ms. Underwood been available at that hour. \u201cThe four of them are unique, and I would include Lauren Underwood in that,\u201d Ms. Vilardi said. \u201cThey\u2019re challenging norms on leadership and what it means to be a strong leader.\u201d Moderates are not the only Democrats who bristle at the women \u2014 or at least the group that backs them. Some veteran members of the Congressional Black Caucus railed against Justice Democrats \u2014 and by implication, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and her chief of staff, Mr. Chakrabarti, who founded it \u2014 in an article in The Hill newspaper. Two senior Democratic aides, both speaking on the condition of anonymity, said several Democratic lawmakers have urged Ms. Ocasio-Cortez to dismiss Mr. Chakrabarti, arguing that his outspokenness is undermining her. Mr. Chakrabarti, who is on paternity leave, did not respond to a request for comment; nor did a spokesman for Ms. Ocasio-Cortez. Waleed Shahid, the Justice Democrats\u2019s communications director, showed no signs of tempering his criticism. On Friday afternoon, as Capitol Hill talked of rapprochement, he used Twitter to talk up conflict: \u201cI don\u2019t understand the aversion to conflict and vague calls for \u2018unity\u2019 on the Hill. Of course, there will be conflict between someone who primaried the 4th ranking House Democrat, participated in a sit-in at @SpeakerPelosi\u2019s office, & encouraged more people to run in primaries.\u201d The foursome\u2019s one unquestionable good for the party is fund-raising; Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, for instance, has already raised $2 million this cycle. But with Mr. Trump determined to make the women the face of the party, some Democrats say they need to tone it down \u2014 or at least be more careful with their words. \u201cThey have been thrust into the middle of a debate about the heart and soul of this country, and that does carry with it a unique set of responsibilities,\u201d said Representative Tom Malinowski, a centrist Democrat from New Jersey. \u201cHe has now put them in a very special position. It would be my hope that all of us, wherever we fall on the ideological spectrum, will advance our agenda while embracing in every possible way the patriotism that we share with all of our fellow Americans.\u201d",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Two of Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s top aides who were instrumental in forging her unexpected path to victory last year are leaving Capitol Hill, less than a month after one of them ignited a firestorm by challenging Speaker Nancy Pelosi and comparing moderate House Democrats to segregationists. House Democrats had been privately calling for the ouster of Saikat Chakrabarti, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s embattled chief of staff. He and Corbin Trent, her communications director, had gone to Capitol Hill determined to wage their confrontational brand of progressive politics forged as leaders of Justice Democrats, a group dedicated to unseating entrenched Democratic lawmakers through primary campaigns. Justice Democrats helped Ms. Ocasio-Cortez sweep to power with the defeat of a veteran House Democrat, Joseph Crowley. But less than a year later, after a bruising skirmish this summer with Democratic leadership, both are calling it quits, they told The Intercept on Friday. Their departures will be seen as Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s most tangible peace offering since her private meeting last week with Ms. Pelosi. Mr. Chakrabarti \u201chas decided to leave the office of Representative Ocasio-Cortez to work with New Consensus to further develop plans for a Green New Deal,\u201d Mr. Trent told The Intercept, referring to the congresswoman\u2019s ambitious climate change program. \u201cWe are extraordinarily grateful for his service to advance a bold agenda and improve the lives of the people in\u201d New York\u2019s 14th District. The New Consensus is a liberal nonprofit organization dedicated to developing and promoting the Green New Deal. Mr. Trent will return to working on Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s campaign. Mr. Chakrabarti, intent on continuing his anti-establishment movement from inside the halls of power, had rankled lawmakers and aides on Capitol Hill after he posted on Twitter his support for liberal candidates trying to topple sitting Democrats and his disdain for Ms. Pelosi\u2019s legislative prowess. His challenges to elected leaders were considered in Congress to be remarkable breaches of protocol from an unelected aide. His position became untenable last month after he compared moderate Democrats who sank a liberal emergency border aid package to \u201cnew Southern Democrats.\u201d They \u201ccertainly seem hell bent to do to black and brown people today what the old Southern Democrats did in the 40s,\u201d he tweeted. He later deleted the post, but the damage was done. In an extraordinary effort to crack down on the chief of staff, Democratic leaders leveraged the House Democratic Caucus\u2019s official Twitter account to resurrect a tweet by Mr. Chakrabarti that said that he believed Representative Sharice Davids of Kansas, one of the first two Native American women to serve in Congress, was enabling a \u201cracist system\u201d in voting for a weaker border aid package. \u201cWho is this guy and why is he explicitly singling out a Native American woman of color?\u201d House Democratic leaders asked on Twitter. Democratic lawmakers, meanwhile, privately implored Ms. Ocasio-Cortez to fire Mr. Chakrabarti to wipe the slate clean.",

      "content": " Was it an infantile expectoration or part of a grand plan? Did he count to 10 before he tweeted or just let the ugliness rip? That\u2019s the question whenever Donald Trump drops a bomb like his suggestion that four congresswomen of color \u201cgo back\u201d to the countries from which they came. This time the answer is easy. The president knew exactly what he was doing. With his attack on the congresswomen \u2014 three of whom were born, as was he, in these United States \u2014 he had specific goals. They\u2019re all about the 2020 presidential campaign, which has now begun in full and will rapidly devolve into a grotesqueness that is sure to make 2016 look like a garden party with cucumber sandwiches. He wants to reframe it, so that he\u2019s running not against whomever the Democrats wind up nominating but against Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib and Ayanna Pressley. Against who they are individually. Against what they represent ideologically. Against what they telegraph about the demographic direction of the country and about a new distribution \u2014 a new sharing \u2014 of power. [Get a more personal, less conventional take on political developments, newsmakers, cultural milestones and more with Frank Bruni\u2019s exclusive commentary every week. Sign up for his newsletter.] Trump doesn\u2019t want to run against Joe Biden, because no matter Biden\u2019s energy level or the oxymoronic record that\u2019s almost inevitable when you\u2019ve put in as many decades in public service as he has, he radiates decency the way Trump glows orange from makeup and tanning beds. He doesn\u2019t want to run against Elizabeth Warren, because all the nicknames in the world won\u2019t erase her seriousness, which brings his incoherence into vivid relief. He doesn\u2019t want to run against Kamala Harris, because he has seen how poised and fierce she can be. Besides, it\u2019s better to run against four people than against one. Four are more readily turned into an idea. A symbol. And what do Ocasio-Cortez, Omar, Tlaib and Pressley symbolize? The oldest of them, Pressley, is 45. Their average age is 38. They suggest in aggregate that the future of both the Democratic Party and the country belongs as much to women and to people of color as to anyone else. Trump is betting that Americans threatened by that will be scared enough to drive up the turnout for him. He\u2019s wagering, too, that enough voters whose allegiances aren\u2019t predetermined will balk at that \u2014 and will overlook his administration\u2019s dysfunction and his own indecency \u2014 to keep him in the White House. So he wants the four congresswomen front and center, which is where his tweet put them. They put themselves there on Monday, at a news conference to respond to him. Omar called for his impeachment. I bet he was fine with that. The four congresswomen \u2014 the Squad, as they\u2019ve come to be known \u2014 make the Democratic Party look much more progressive than it actually is. The president and his minions are counting on that. And unlike Democrats\u2019 eventual pick to take on Trump, the Squad won\u2019t be sanding down their most leftward edges or striking notes ambiguous or elastic enough to soothe the center. That\u2019s a presidential-nominee thing. That\u2019s most definitely not a first-term-in-the-House thing. These four are also a tool for promoting discord in the Democratic ranks, because as the recent feud between them and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi demonstrated, plenty of their fellow Democrats find them too fantastically idealistic, too censorious of those who disagree with them, too quick to play the race card, too much. For now, Trump\u2019s shocking and unconscionable tweet has downgraded that feud and united Democrats, who immediately drafted a House resolution that formally condemns his comments as racist. They\u2019re daring Republicans to vote against it and seemingly go on record in support of what he said. But that\u2019s just for now. What happens next week, next month and next year is an open question. It\u2019s no accident that around the same time that Trump fired off his racist tweet, Democratic strategists were, according to a report in Axios, circulating a private poll of potential swing voters \u2014 white people with two years of college or less \u2014 that showed that 74 percent of them recognized Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s name but only 22 percent had a favorable view of her, while 53 percent recognized Omar but only 9 percent saw her favorably. If Democrats have numbers like that, Republicans almost certainly do, too. And Republicans know how to pick \u2014 and pick apart \u2014 their enemies. But Trump is up to something else as well. He means to send liberals into such a fury that they believe that passionately calling him out and urging the opposite of whatever he\u2019s saying and doing are strategy enough. He\u2019s baiting them. Why are so many Democratic presidential candidates recommending what sounds a lot like open borders, which won\u2019t go down well with many of the voters the party needs? It\u2019s a response in part to Trump\u2019s xenophobia and cruelty when it comes to immigration. Similarly, the candidates\u2019 gusto for Medicare for all, whose popularity is highly debatable, owes at least something to Trump\u2019s assault on Obamacare and complete disregard for uninsured Americans. Many Democrats are defining themselves as antonyms to Trump. That\u2019s different from merely opposing him, and it might not be the way to go. Trump gets that. He\u2019s ignorant, not stupid. And he understands that if he causes enough offense and creates enough melodrama, the screaming in the public square will be so loud that many battered and baffled Americans won\u2019t be able to hear the inner voice that\u2019s telling them what they should and at some level do know: that he must go. That the price of giving him eight years in the White House could be the soul of a great nation. That we can\u2019t afford that.",

      "author": "Jeffery C. Mays",
      "content": " [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] President Trump and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are diametrical opposites in nearly every way, except perhaps for their shared home state of New York and their social media dominance. But now there may be another thing that binds the two: a federal appeals panel ruling on Tuesday found that Mr. Trump, a Republican, has been violating the Constitution by blocking people from following him on Twitter because they criticized or mocked him. That ruling is now the basis of two lawsuits filed against Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat, accusing her of blocking people because of their opposing political stances. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez has 4.7 million followers on her personal Twitter account, @AOC, which she uses to frequently discuss policy and advocate her proposals, such as the Green New Deal and her belief that the camps holding children and other undocumented immigrants seeking asylum at the Texas border are \u201cconcentration camps.\u201d Dov Hikind, a former assemblyman from Brooklyn who is the founder of Americans Against Anti-Semitism, said he regularly replied to Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s tweets, but was blocked on July 8. Joseph Saladino, a YouTube personality known as \u201cJoey Salads\u201d who is running for a congressional seat representing Brooklyn and Staten Island, said he was blocked on May 9. But because Ms. Ocasio-Cortez uses the account to discuss policies that affect them, she cannot use it to \u201csuppress contrary views\u201d and violate his First Amendment rights to free speech, Mr. Hikind said in his lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court in Brooklyn. \u201cIt\u2019s very clear based on the court\u2019s ruling that A.O.C. is violating my constitutional rights to free speech by excluding me,\u201d Mr. Hikind said in an interview. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t want me to be a part of the discussion and conversation.\u201d Mr. Hikind said he was blocked after criticizing Ms. Ocasio-Cortez for her concentration camp comments. \u201cShe has a right to have that position. That\u2019s not the issue. The question is why is she afraid of other people\u2019s positions?\u201d he added. Mr. Saladino, whose pranks have been criticized as racist, filed a separate lawsuit in Federal District Court in Manhattan. He said that as a practical matter, he does not care if Ms. Ocasio-Cortez blocked him because he can still access her Twitter comments from an anonymous account. He said his complaint is a test of whether there is a double standard in the courts for liberals and conservatives. \u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s like a social experiment to see if the standards will apply equally,\u201d Mr. Saladino said. \u201cWill the courts rule the same way against A.O.C. as Trump?\u201d Corbin Trent, a spokesman for Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, declined to comment about pending litigation. Blocking on social media is done across political party lines. In 2017, for example, ProPublica sent letters asking all 50 governors and 22 federal agencies whether they had blocked people on social media. Five Republican governors, four Democrats and four agencies responded with information about people they had blocked. Many agencies and more than half the governors did not respond. In New York, the issue has arisen with Representative Peter King, a 14-term Republican congressman who represents parts of Nassau and Suffolk Counties on Long Island. In April, the New York Civil Liberties Union threatened to sue Mr. King if he did not unblock the 70 or so constituents who were banned from his \u201cCongressman Peter King\u201d Facebook page for criticizing him. In May, Mr. King added a new Facebook page that he said would be his official government account, and that he would not ban people from it. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s @AOC account is not her official congressional account. Her official congressional account, @RepAOC, has 172,000 followers and was last updated July 5, as of Wednesday afternoon. Jacob Weinstein, Mr. Hikind\u2019s lawyer, noted that the court ruling concerned the @realDonaldTrump personal account, with its 61.8 million followers, that Mr. Trump uses most often to comment on Twitter, not his official presidential Twitter account. \u201cIt comes down to the First Amendment,\u201d Mr. Weinstein said. \u201cTwitter is a public forum. Imagine a politician is giving a town hall. Imagine if they only select people they like.\u201d In the appeals court ruling against Mr. Trump, the panel considered the function of the social media account over its form, said Katie Fallow, a senior attorney at the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University who filed and argued the lawsuit against the president. The ruling doesn\u2019t prevent elected officials from acting to prevent true threats or from muting individuals on Twitter. \u201cWe certainly think that Representative Ocasio-Cortez has been a very enthusiastic and good advocate for free speech and dissent,\u201d Ms. Fallow added, \u201cand we hope she would look at this court decision and conclude the better way is not to block people that are criticizing her.\u201d",

      "content": " On July 2, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, after a visit to migrant detention facilities run by Customs and Border Protection in Texas, claimed that the United States is \u201cheaded toward fascism.\u201d Much of the response that followed was expected, but little or none of it examined the statement closely or detailed to what degree the United States\u2019 immigration policy justifies such comparisons. So how apt is this analogy between the current situation and early years of fascist regimes? Liberal democracy organizes society around respect for the dignity, equality and freedom of all human beings. Fascism, by contrast, organizes society around the vilification of outsiders. In this administration\u2019s rhetoric toward undocumented immigrants from Central America and religious minorities, we have been subject to classic fascist tropes for some time. The obsessive focus on immigration and the representation of immigrants as invaders is particularly indicative of this ideology. In the 1930s, Oswald Mosley, the head of the British Union of Fascists, ran on a platform of ending immigration entirely. \u201cBritain for the British\u201d was its motto. Comparisons to the Nazi regime, one of which Ms. Ocasio-Cortez made last month when she called American detention facilities \u201cconcentration camps,\u201d are also routinely met with outrage. But Hitler, too, was obsessed with immigration. In \u201cMein Kampf\u201d he praised the \u201cnational State,\u201d and he saw foreign immigration as the obstacle. He wrote of America\u2019s anti-immigration policies as a model for a nationalistic Germany: The current American administration clearly does not share the toxic and murderous ideology of Nazism, nor its anti-Semitism, but when the president of the United States derides immigrants from \u201cshithole countries\u201d while pleading for more immigrants from Northern Europe, he echoes the very aspects of American history that Hitler praised. When we consider the character of a ruling government, we should think about the ideology that motivates it, as well as the institutions and tactics it employs to transform society. It is clear that this administration draws on fascist ideology in its rhetoric. But what about its institutions and tactics? On June 17, President Trump tweeted that Immigration and Customs Enforcement would deport millions of \u201cillegal aliens.\u201d He\u2019s not the first president to focus on undocumented immigrants for removal. Every president since the Sept. 11 attacks, including Barack Obama, has, too. But the Obama administration explicitly prioritized terrorists and serious criminal offenders. The Trump administration is the first in recent memory to target undocumented families for removal in planned mass deportation raids. Trump\u2019s announcement about mass deportations conveyed the kind of cruelty toward outsiders that he often uses to excite his base. It was only a matter of time before such rhetoric would begin to transform our institutions. ICE is a novel American institution \u2014 it was created in 2003 by the Homeland Security Act in the wake of Sept. 11, at a time when rights and liberties took a back seat to concerns about safety. The same act created the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection, tasked with policing the border and staffing migrant detention centers. In ICE, we have a special force, created in an anti-democratic moment in American history, authorized with police-like power and directed at political outsiders inside our borders. The institution itself is tied politically to the country\u2019s leader. Trump is the first president endorsed by a major union representing ICE\u2019s employees, and Trump has repeatedly represented himself as its chief defender. ICE is an organization that is like the police but is not the police. The job of the police in a democratic society is to keep communities safe. In practice, ICE collaborates with conventional American criminal justice institutions, including local police departments, but often end up working at cross-purposes with them by creating fear in immigrant communities, whose members become less likely to report crime. As a result, some police chiefs have aligned themselves recently against ICE raids. The goal of ICE is not to make communities safer. ICE\u2019s mission is to reinforce a distinction between \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem.\u201d The Trump administration has advanced its more aggressive policies of enforcement by characterizing undocumented immigrants as a group of criminals, rather than as individuals. In 2017, Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly ordered ICE to portray immigrants in general as intrinsically prone to crime to justify mass arrests by highlighting \u201cthree egregious cases\u201d to use in the media. This tactic of identifying whole groups as criminal has a shameful history. In my grandmother\u2019s 1957 memoir of 1930s Berlin, she reports similar tactics by the Gestapo in 1937, who spoke of \u201ccriminal\u201d Jews while arresting Jewish citizens who had committed minor traffic violations. To be sure, no organizations precisely like the Nazi SS or the SA or Italy\u2019s fascist Blackshirts operate in the United States today. There is no organization empowered to make arrests that originated as a paramilitary force, or that has an official racist ideology, or that is used to overtly target political opponents. ICE is not the SS or the Gestapo. But it has concerning similarities, including its symbiotic relationship with an increasingly authoritarian president. And it is not the only institution with disturbing fascist elements; evidence of extreme racism and sexism has emerged among members of its sister organization, Customs and Border Protection. The special circumstances under which ICE was created and now operates also lends credence to the argument that ICE is expendable, a nonessential and arguably harmful arm of government that could be eliminated. What about the private detention centers for undocumented immigrants, which Ms. Ocasio-Cortez described last month as concentration camps? After the comparison, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum issued a news release denouncing comparisons to the Holocaust. In response, hundreds of historians and other academics working on the Holocaust and genocide responded with a letter defending the importance of these analogies. As Kica Matos at the Vera Institute of Justice explained to me, journalists are barred from visiting these centers; they are open only to legal representatives and members of Congress. In early June, the Trump administration canceled educational, recreational and legal aid for migrant children in detention centers, sealing them off further from public view. Reports of the extreme conditions in these centers have flooded the news in recent weeks. These reports have been provided by legal representatives empowered to visit them. What happens now, as Ms. Matos asked,  that funding is cut off for such visits? Even as we are shut off from facts, immigrants will hear the stories from one another. The strategy here is to encourage them to self-deport. This, too, is familiar from history. In the November 1938 pogrom of German Jews, more than 30,000 of them were rounded up and sent to concentration camps, where they were subjected to brutal and inhumane conditions and soon released. In \u201cKL: A History of the Nazi Concentration Camps,\u201d Nikolaus Wachsmann, a professor of European history at the University of London, explains that the release of these prisoners made sense from the regime\u2019s perspective, because \u201cthe camps had served their function \u2014 forcing many Jews out of Germany.\u201d The regime\u2019s harsh anti-Semitic rhetoric, followed by exposure of its Jewish citizens to the brutality of its camps, led to a large exodus of Jews from Germany (including my grandmother and my father in July 1939). The tactic worked. Should we therefore employ it? There is an economic reality to this situation as well. We increasingly see connections between powerful business interests and the institutions of state terror. Wall Street gives billions in loans to facilitate the profits of companies who run detention centers; large companies make profits by selling their wares to them, and former high ranking administration officials serve on their boards. On the local level, county jails enjoy newfound profits by housing those detained by ICE\u2019s massively broadened mandate. A refusal to discuss fascism in the current political context in the United States obscures both the nature of fascism, representing it as an all-or-nothing matter, as well as our own troubling past. The extent to which a society is liberal democratic or fascist can be measured on a continuum. In the struggles with our racist history \u2014 against black Americans, Native Americans and immigration from non-Northern European countries \u2014 the United States has always had aspects of both. With the development of a police-like force directed specifically to force outsiders into hiding, detention centers sealed off from public view in which to detain them and an economy set up to profit from it all, we move in the wrong direction.",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Senator Kamala Harris of California and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York on Monday unveiled legislation aimed at ensuring that climate change plans benefit low-income communities. They described the measure as a key element of the Democrats\u2019 Green New Deal. The effort comes as Ms. Harris, who is running for president, and other Democratic candidates prepare for a set of debates in Detroit this week. Racial and economic disparities on issues ranging from housing to education are expected to take center stage. [Follow our coverage of the next Democratic primary debates.] Ms. Harris, who has yet to release a comprehensive climate change plan of her own, has focused much of her economic agenda on providing tax credits and other assistance to low- and middle-income Americans. This month, she and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez introduced a bill designed to help people with criminal records obtain housing. The new proposal, titled the Climate Equity Act, provides a view of Ms. Harris\u2019s environmental priorities. Under the plan, any environmental regulation or legislation would be rated based on its impact on low-income communities, which are disproportionately affected by climate change because they are often in flood zones, near highways or power plants, or adjacent to polluted lands known as brownfields. The rating system would be modeled after the Congressional Budget Office score, which measures the costs of every major piece of legislation. \u201cWe can\u2019t do anything without a C.B.O. score, but we never actually consider if it\u2019s disastrous to communities as long as it\u2019s revenue-neutral,\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said in an interview. The bill would also establish an independent Office of Climate and Environmental Justice Accountability to represent vulnerable communities, and create a position of senior adviser on climate justice at \u201call relevant agencies.\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez was the primary House sponsor of the Green New Deal, a nonbinding resolution that set out a broad vision for significantly reducing planet-warming pollution by 2030 while also guaranteeing millions of new jobs. She said low-income workers were often ignored in the climate discussion. \u201cOne of the tenets of the Green New Deal is prioritizing vulnerable communities,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to talk about Flint. We have to talk about West Virginia. We have to talk about the Bronx and we have to talk about the ways climate change manifests in our lives.\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said that she had not endorsed anyone in the presidential race and noted that she had worked with various candidates on different aspects of the climate challenge. Climate change analysts said they were encouraged by the bill, and by the fact that several presidential candidates had recently made issues of equity more central to their discussions of the environment. Many of the candidates\u2019 early plans for tackling global warming focused almost entirely on methods of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, including by establishing a price on carbon dioxide, eliminating coal-fired power plants and investing billions of dollars in clean energy technologies. But in another example of the growing focus on economic and racial disparities, Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington released the final plank of a five-part global warming plan on Monday, aimed at new federal policies to prioritize low-income areas and communities of color. Mr. Inslee, who has made climate change the top issue of his presidential campaign, also called for a way to score, or screen, federal environmental decisions and proposed a new office dedicated to environmental justice. Tom Steyer, the billionaire former hedge fund investor who also is running for president, last week released his own \u201cjustice-centered\u201d five-pillar plan for tackling climate change focused on protecting low-income communities. The new plans \u201csend an important signal,\u201d said Mustafa Ali, who ran the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s environmental justice office under the Obama administration. \u201cThey are timely and they are needed,\u201d he said, \u201cand they help us to begin to think critically about the steps that are going to be necessary to protect people\u2019s lives in the moment, and in these challenges that are rushing at us at a very quick pace.\u201d The candidates are making equity a top issue in other arenas. This month Ms. Harris has introduced a $100 billion housing plan to help black families and individuals buy homes in historically redlined communities, and a $75 billion initiative to invest in minority-owned businesses and historically black colleges. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts has called for an executive order requiring recipients of federal contracts to diversify their workforces. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey has proposed creating savings accounts for every child born in the United States. Ms. Harris also released her health care plan on Monday, proposing a system that would provide Medicare for all Americans but allow people to choose private plans modeled on Medicare Advantage. Ms. Harris\u2019s campaign said her full climate plan was forthcoming. But in a statement, Ms. Harris said she believed it was important to address equity even before nailing down the specifics of how to curb carbon emissions. \u201cWe cannot accept a status quo where children of color are drinking toxic water in Flint or breathing toxic air in Louisiana\u2019s Cancer Alley,\u201d she said. \u201cThis systemic environmental injustice will only get worse and become more ingrained if climate and environmental policies like the Green New Deal do not specifically focus on lifting up these communities.\u201d",

      "content": " A Facebook post by a Louisiana police officer suggesting that Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez \u201cneeds a round\u201d drew criticism on Sunday from officials in the city where he works. The officer, Charlie Rispoli, a 14-year veteran of the police department in Gretna, La., referred to Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York, in a post on Thursday as \u201cthis vile idiot.\u201d The post continued, saying she \u201cneeds a round \u2014 and I don\u2019t mean the kind she used to serve,\u201d a reference to her past work as a bartender, according to a screenshot of his comment obtained by The Times-Picayune of New Orleans. He was responding to a post by the satirical website tatersgonnatate.com with the headline \u201cOcasio-Cortez on the Budget: \u2018We Pay Soldiers Too Much.\u2019\u201d Wayne Rau, a city councilman and the mayor pro tem of Gretna, a city of about 18,000 people across the Mississippi River from New Orleans, condemned Officer Rispoli\u2019s post in an interview on Sunday. \u201cI\u2019m pretty appalled by it,\u201d Mr. Rau said. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is a representation of the police department of the city of Gretna.\u201d Asked whether Officer Rispoli\u2019s Facebook post was a threat, he said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure how to take that post.\u201d He said it should be up to the city\u2019s police chief, Arthur Lawson, to decide on any disciplinary or criminal action. In addition to Mr. Rau, there are four other members on the Gretna City Council. Three were not immediately available for comment on Sunday. The fourth, Jackie Berthelot, directed questions to the Police Department. Efforts on Sunday to reach Officer Rispoli, who appeared to have deactivated his Facebook account, were unsuccessful. Corbin Trent, a spokesman for Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, declined to comment. Chief Lawson, who is an elected official, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Sunday. The chief told The Times-Picayune that he was disturbed by the post. \u201cI will tell you this: This will not go unchecked,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to take this lightly and this will be dealt with on our end. It\u2019s not something we want someone that\u2019s affiliated with our department to make these types of statements. That\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d The chief said that the post appeared to violate the department\u2019s social media policy but that he did not think it rose to the level of being a threat. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez is part of a quartet of first-year Democrats in the House known as \u201cthe squad\u201d who have received death threats and were told by President Trump to \u201cgo back where you came from\u201d in a racially charged post on Twitter. Belinda Constant, the mayor of Gretna, said on Sunday that she had been out of the state and was not immediately prepared to comment. \u201cI will be looking into the situation,\u201d Ms. Constant, a Democrat, said. Eva Malecki, a spokeswoman for the United States Capitol Police, declined to say whether the agency was investigating. \u201cThe mission of the United States Capitol Police is to protect and serve Congress,\u201d she said. \u201cHowever, we do not discuss how we carry out our protective responsibilities.\u201d The four congresswomen were also the subject of a recent Facebook post by the Republican County Chairmen\u2019s Association of Illinois, which depicted them in a mock movie poster that referred to them as the \u201cjihad squad.\u201d \u201cPolitical Jihad is their game,\u201d said the post, which was published on Friday and later deleted. \u201cIf you don\u2019t agree with their socialist ideology you\u2019re racist.\u201d It showed Representatives Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Ayanna S. Pressley of Massachusetts brandishing guns. On Sunday night, the state\u2019s Republican Party chairman, Tim Schneider, issued a statement disavowing the post, which he said did not reflect the party\u2019s values. \u201cBigoted rhetoric greatly distracts from legitimate and important policy debates and further divides our nation,\u201d Mr. Schneider said, adding, \u201cI urge everyone who opposes them to keep the rhetoric focused on policy and ideology.\u201d",

      "content": " Just a few years ago, the phrase \u201cindustrial policy\u201d was employed mainly as a term of abuse. Economists almost universally insisted that state interventions to improve competitiveness, prioritize investment in strategic sectors and structure market incentives around political goals were backward policies doomed to failure \u2014 whether applied in America, Asia or anywhere in between. The political consensus that had prevailed since Ronald Reagan, across both Republican and Democratic administrations, favored free markets, trade liberalization and deregulated finance. Bill Clinton, for instance, reduced trade barriers and the regulatory structure around finance as enthusiastically as both Bush administrations. In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, however, the Reagan-Bush-Clinton neoliberal consensus seems intellectually and politically bankrupt. Party \u201cestablishments\u201d appear incapable of proposing, much less advancing, policies sufficient to address major economic challenges. And the Trump administration has pursued a mostly incoherent and so far ineffective combination of tax cuts and tariffs. But now a growing number of politicians and intellectuals \u2014 left and right, \u201cpopulist\u201d and \u201cestablishment,\u201d from Senator Marco Rubio to Senator Elizabeth Warren, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to Senator Josh Hawley \u2014 are finding common ground under the banner of industrial policy. Even the typically neoliberal Financial Times editorial board recently argued in favor of industrial policy, calling on the United States to \u201cdrop concerns around state planning.\u201d Why now? The United States has essentially experienced two lost decades, and inequality has reached Gilded Age levels. Productivity growth has stagnated, and trade deficits in advanced technology products continue to widen. The \u201cinformation economy\u201d job of the future has turned out to be driving an Uber, along with other poorly paid, precarious, low-value-added service jobs. The growth of the financial sector has done little to encourage productive investment in the real economy, and the short-term financial engineering it facilitates has inflated catastrophic asset bubbles. The deindustrialization of the United States has now proceeded to such an extent that even critical defense sectors are compromised. From submarines and aircraft to medicine, the military is dependent on foreign supply chains, including those running through geopolitical rivals. In telecommunications, China essentially won the 5G race, and recent efforts to discourage allies from buying Huawei network components have been rebuffed on multiple occasions. America is also at risk of being leapfrogged by China in key areas like A.I. and quantum computing. These problems will not be solved by tariffs alone or related proposals like a market access charge on foreign capital. In the first place, foreign central banks can easily retaliate against these measures through currency manipulation or other means. More fundamentally, United States industry is losing ground to foreign competitors on price, quality and technology. In many areas, our manufacturing capacity cannot compete with what exists in Asia, and more and more research and development funding is flowing to China. A successful American industrial policy would draw on replicable foreign models as well as take lessons from our history. Some simple first steps would be to update the Small Business Investment Company and Small Business Innovation Research programs \u2014 which played a role in catalyzing Silicon Valley decades ago \u2014 to focus more on domestic hardware businesses. The upcoming reauthorization of the Small Business Administration offers a chance to make changes along these lines. Government agencies could also step in to seed investment funds focused on strategic industries and to incentivize commercial lending to key sectors, policies that have proven successful in other countries (including in Canada, Britain, Israel, South Korea, China, Taiwan and Singapore). The federal government should also be spending more on basic research, which has declined significantly in recent decades as a percentage of gross domestic product. Already too much of basic research funding effectively functions as a subsidy for other countries. Because of a lack of scale-up funding or technical capacity or both, many inventions cannot be produced in the United States. Too often, the most promising ideas migrate to Asia, where the factories and, increasingly, the engineering talent and funding for non-software companies are. So the United States needs to invest more in applied research, perhaps borrowing from Germany\u2019s Fraunhofer Institutes. Elizabeth Warren has also proposed a government-sponsored research and licensing model for the pharmaceutical industry, which could be applied to other industries as well. More ambitiously, Timothy Meyer and Ganesh Sitaraman of Vanderbilt Law School have proposed a large-scale reorganization of federal agencies, bringing domestic development, trade and export promotion under one Department of Economic Growth and Security, which would focus on both domestic economic policy and international competition. Ms. Warren has embraced a version of this idea. Similarly, Senator Gary Peters, Democrat of Michigan, has called for the creation of a National Institute of Manufacturing, taking inspiration from the National Institutes of Health. As America falls behind in key technologies, we may also have to use defense procurement, along with other carrots and sticks, to mobilize companies to compete in strategic sectors, such as 5G. America has a long and successful history of employing this sort of robust industrial policy. In addition to improving competitiveness and productivity growth, industrial policy may be the only way to meaningfully increase economic opportunities for struggling regions and populations. More generally, during the last several decades, the benefits of productivity gains have mostly accrued to the largest capital holders. A successful industrial policy would aim to strengthen worker bargaining power while organizing and training a better skilled labor force. Industrial policy also involves, and even depends upon, rebuilding infrastructure. Most debates concerning industrial policy have so far occurred within, rather than between, political parties. But as the issue gains prominence within both parties, differences over the priorities and content of industrial policy can be expected to fall along partisan lines. The right will be likely to prioritize technological competition and securing the defense industrial base. The left is likely to emphasize wages, environmental sustainability and using industrial policy to alter the \u201cprimary distribution\u201d of wealth \u2014 rather than relying solely on secondary redistribution through taxes and transfers while leaving basic neoliberal structures intact \u2014 as can be seen in the Green New Deal. Just as Republicans and Democrats in the Bush-Clinton era had intense debates over issues like marginal tax rates, all the while advancing an underlying neoliberal agenda, so will future debates play out in an era of renewed industrial policy. Uniting both sides will be a desire to revitalize domestic industry and to use the state to ensure that the economy serves a broader set of stakeholders and public interests rather than only large shareholders. Perhaps more important than any partisan debates will be the position of the corporate sector. There is no industrial policy without industry, after all, and this is especially true given the oligarchic character of American politics. For several decades, business leaders have been indoctrinated to believe that success is simply a matter of maximizing short-term profits for shareholders. Corporate America and its lobbyists have prioritized labor arbitrage over innovation and productivity, share buybacks over investment. But as the disappointing economic performance of the last several years demonstrates, especially the failure of the staggering 2017 tax cuts to stimulate growth and investment, that model is exhausted. Business leaders are slowly beginning to recognize that they have more to gain from greater state support of domestic industry, as well as from a stronger and more stable labor force with greater spending power. As a recent report from Mr. Rubio\u2019s office makes clear, \u201cthe U.S. cannot escape or avoid decisions about industrial policy.\u201d Refusal to consciously pursue a serious industrial policy simply means accepting a counterproductive one \u2014 and an economy shaped by the industrial policies of others. After decades of economic mismanagement, prominent figures in both parties are finally awakening to this reality, and a new consensus on the need for a strong industrial policy is beginning to emerge.",

In a brief series of tweets, Ocasio-Cortez made the case against the Electoral College and argued for a national popular vote to choose the president. \u201cEvery vote should be = in America, no matter who you are or where you come from,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe right thing to do is establish a Popular Vote. & GOP will do everything they can to fight it.\u201d Crenshaw, who has sparred with Ocasio-Cortez before, jumped in with a response: \u201cAbolishing the Electoral College means that politicians will only campaign in (and listen to) urban areas. That is not a representative democracy.\u201d And then he said it: \u201cWe live in a republic, which means 51% of the population doesn\u2019t get to boss around the other 49%.\u201d [Jamelle Bouie answered your questions about this column on Twitter.] Crenshaw is wrong on the impact of ending the Electoral College. A presidential candidate who focused only on America\u2019s cities and urban centers would lose \u2014 there just aren\u2019t enough votes. Republicans live in cities just as Democrats live in rural areas. Under a popular vote, candidates would still have to build national coalitions across demographic and geographic lines. The difference is that those coalitions would involve every region of the country instead of a handful of competitive states in the Rust Belt and parts of the South. But the crux of Crenshaw\u2019s argument is his second point. \u201cWe live in a republic.\u201d He doesn\u2019t say \u201cnot a democracy,\u201d but it\u2019s implied by the next clause, where he rejects majority rule \u2014 \u201c51% of the population doesn\u2019t get to boss around the other 49%.\u201d [Join Jamelle Bouie as he shines a light on overlooked writing, culture and ideas from around the internet. For exclusive thoughts, photos and reading recommendations, sign up for his newsletter.] You can fill in the blanks of the argument from there. The Founding Fathers built a government to stymie the \u201ctyranny of the majority.\u201d They contrasted their \u201crepublic\u201d with \u201cdemocracy,\u201d which they condemned as dangerous and unstable. As John Adams wrote in an 1814 letter to the Virginia politician John Taylor: \u201cDemocracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts and murders itself. There never was a Democracy Yet, that did not commit suicide.\u201d But there\u2019s a problem. For the founders, \u201cdemocracy\u201d did not mean majority rule in a system of representation. The men who led the revolution and devised the Constitution were immersed in classical literature and political theory. Ancient Greece, in particular, was a cautionary tale. When James Madison critiqued \u201cdemocracy\u201d in Federalist No. 10, he meant the Athenian sort: \u201ca society consisting of a small number of citizens, who assemble and administer the government in person.\u201d This he contrasted with a \u201crepublic\u201d or \u201ca government in which the scheme of representation takes place.\u201d Likewise, in a 1788 speech to the New York ratification convention, Alexander Hamilton disavowed \u201cthe ancient democracies in which the people themselves deliberated.\u201d They \u201cnever possessed one good feature of government,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir very character was tyranny; their figure deformity.\u201d In more modern terms, the founders feared \u201cdirect democracy\u201d and accounted for its dangers with a system of \u201crepresentative democracy.\u201d Yes, this \u201crepublic\u201d had counter-majoritarian aspects, like equal representation of states in the Senate, the presidential veto and the Supreme Court. But it was not designed for minority rule. Virtually everything was geared toward producing representative majorities that could govern on behalf of the country \u2014 to diminish \u201cfaction\u201d in favor of consensus. And in the case of the Electoral College, the point wasn\u2019t to stymie majorities but to provide a way to find a competent and popular chief executive in a large nation of parochial states. It\u2019s worth asking where this quip \u2014 \u201cwe\u2019re a republic, not a democracy\u201d \u2014 even came from. Nicole Hemmer, a historian of American politics and the author of \u201cMessengers of the Right: Conservative Media and the Transformation of American Politics,\u201d traces it to the 1930s and 40s. \u201cWhen Franklin Roosevelt made defending democracy a core component of his argument for preparing for, and then intervening in, the war in Europe, opponents of U.S. intervention began to push back by arguing that the U.S. was not, in fact, a democracy,\u201d she wrote in an email. One Roosevelt opponent, for example \u2014 Boake Carter, a newspaper columnist who supported the America First Committee (which opposed American entry into World War II) \u2014 wrote a column in October 1940 called \u201cA Republic Not a Democracy,\u201d in which he strongly rebuked the president for using the word \u201cdemocracy\u201d to describe the country. \u201cThe United States was never a democracy, isn\u2019t a democracy, and I hope it will never be a democracy,\u201d Carter wrote. The term went from conservative complaint to right-wing slogan in the 1960s, when Robert Welch, the founder of the John Birch Society, used it in a September 1961 speech, \u201cRepublics and Democracies.\u201d In a democracy, Welch protested, \u201cthere is a centralization of governmental power in a simple majority. And that, visibly, is the system of government which the enemies of our republic are seeking to impose on us today.\u201d \u201cThis is a Republic, not a Democracy,\u201d Welch said in conclusion, \u201cLet\u2019s keep it that way!\u201d These origins are important. If there\u2019s substance behind \u201cWe\u2019re a republic, not a democracy,\u201d it\u2019s not as a description of American government. There\u2019s really no difference, in the present, between a \u201crepublic\u201d and a \u201cdemocracy\u201d: Both connote systems of representation in which sovereignty and authority derive from the public at large. The point of the slogan isn\u2019t to describe who we are, but to claim and co-opt the founding for right-wing politics \u2014 to naturalize political inequality and make it the proper order of things. What lies behind that quip, in other words, is an impulse against democratic representation. It is part and parcel of the drive to make American government a closed domain for a select, privileged few.",

      "content": " [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is calling for a government bailout for New York taxi drivers, emerging as the most prominent voice to back a financial rescue plan for thousands of drivers who were channeled into exploitative loans. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat who said her district in the Bronx and Queens is home to many cabdrivers, jumped into a debate over how to help drivers who were urged to take out loans with high fees, interest-only payments and other one-sided terms. They borrowed the money to buy taxi medallions, the city permit that allowed them to own and operate their cabs. \u201cThis is manufactured financial indentured servitude,\u201d she said during a congressional hearing on lending on Thursday. \u201cAnd it is wrong. We need to bail out these drivers.\u201d Two other Democrats from New York, Representatives Nydia Vel\u00e1zquez and Carolyn B. Maloney, also decried the loans in the meeting, the first congressional hearing to address the driver debt crisis since it was revealed by a New York Times series. The Times reported this year that a handful of New York taxi industry leaders had made hundreds of millions of dollars by artificially inflating medallion prices and issuing reckless loans to thousands of immigrant drivers. As regulators stood by, medallion prices soared above $1 million before the bubble burst in late 2014, rocking the industry. More than 950 New York cabdrivers have filed for bankruptcy, and thousands more are struggling to hang on, The Times found. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan and the New York State attorney general\u2019s office are investigating the lending practices, and the city is taking steps to hold the industry leaders accountable. Those leaders have denied wrongdoing, blaming woes in the industry on ride-hailing companies such as Uber and Lyft. Lawmakers have also drafted new rules to help prevent abusive practices and created a task force to discuss the taxi crisis. But a schism has emerged among some city officials over a government bailout of drivers. Some say the city bears partial responsibility for the crisis because regulators encouraged the buying frenzy. Others, including Mayor Bill de Blasio, say a bailout would be too expensive. The mayor\u2019s office has said a bailout could cost as much as $13 billion. Others put the cost as low as $300 million under a possible hybrid solution that would provide government assistance, but also require lenders to forgive some of the debt. A spokeswoman for Mr. de Blasio did not immediately respond to a request for comment. New York City\u2019s congressional delegation, along with the City Council, has taken a leading role in pushing for at least a partial bailout. In July, Ms. Vel\u00e1zquez and nine other members of the delegation sent a letter calling for the task force to discuss a bailout. Last month, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and 10 other members sent a letter asking several federal regulatory agencies to provide information on how they plan to protect cabdrivers. At the hearing on Thursday, Ms. Maloney called for the federal agencies that now hold some of the loans to stop foreclosing on borrowers. \u201cAfter years of predatory loans and inflated medallion prices, the yellow cabs of New York really turned into financial traps for thousands of mostly immigrant drivers,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a New York City scandal, really.\u201d Ms. Vel\u00e1zquez said that in response to the Times series, she was preparing legislation to strengthen protections and disclosures in small business loans. Bhairavi Desai, the head of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, which represents both drivers who own medallions and those who work for fleets, attended the hearing in Washington with 15 drivers. She said she believed that a bailout was increasingly possible. Ms. Desai, a member of the task force, also said she hoped that a bailout plan was among the recommendations set to be released early next year. Several City Council members who have urged a bailout said they were encouraged by the support from Washington. \u201cThere is growing momentum behind our push for the city to buy or guarantee these wildly inflated mortgages so that they can finally be refinanced on fair terms,\u201d said Mark Levine, a city councilman in Manhattan. \u201cA consensus is emerging that this would be far less costly than the ridiculous multibillion dollar estimates that have been thrown around. Having the congressional spotlight shine on this crisis is a huge boost to our efforts.\u201d",

      "content": "  At a crowded town-hall-style meeting hosted in Queens on Thursday by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a young woman stood up and began addressing the climate crisis. But her pleas took an abrupt turn for the absurd. \u201cYour next campaign slogan has to be this,\u201d she said, removing her jacket to reveal a T-shirt that said, \u201cSave the Planet, Eat the Children.\u201d \u201cWe got to start eating babies,\u201d the woman said. \u201cThere\u2019s too much CO2. All of you, you know, you\u2019re a pollutant.\u201d Was the woman serious? Was she ill? Was this an act? The answer to the latter question appears to be known: A fringe activist group, the Lyndon LaRouche Political Action Committee, took credit for the stunt on Twitter, saying, \u201cIt was us,\u201d and \u201csometimes, only satire works.\u201d Nonetheless, the moment \u2014 and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s measured response \u2014 sparked a debate that ricocheted around the internet, with #EattheBabies trending on Twitter. Why didn\u2019t she denounce a plan to eat babies? Did she really have to? On Thursday night, President Trump pointed his Twitter followers to the exchange and called the congresswoman \u201ca Wack Job!\u201d She replied, \u201cBetter than being a criminal who betrays our country.\u201d What has been immediately clear since her election last year is that practically anywhere Ms. Ocasio-Cortez goes, attention is paid. That was especially true for Thursday\u2019s meeting, inside the Queens Public Library in Corona. The Democratic congresswoman represents parts of Queens and the Bronx. Congress members regularly have these types of events with little fanfare. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s was different: It was packed with constituents, reporters and at least one television camera, carrying the event live on C-Span. In other words, it was the perfect stage for a performance. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez stood in the front of the room with her head tilted, as if listening intently. Organizers eventually began to gather around the speaker, presumably to end her diatribe. Still, the woman implored Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, \u201cThis is very serious. Please give a response.\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, whose progressive activism and support for the Green New Deal helped make her a target of right-wing provocateurs, replied earnestly. \u201cWe need to treat the climate crisis with the urgency that it does present,\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said. She added: \u201cIf we act in a positive way, there is space for hope. We are never beyond hope.\u201d The audience applauded and the woman was led out of the event. LaRouche supporters do not believe climate science, and are backers of Mr. Trump\u2019s skeptical approach on the topic. On Friday, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez returned to the topic, writing on Twitter that the woman was a \u201cTrump supporter,\u201d adding that her political affiliation did not rule out a \u201cpotential mental issue (Drs do that) but good to know they were not in crisis. Earlier this year I was stalked & very nearly hurt by a disturbed person. I don\u2019t take chances & immediately try to de-escalate.\u201d",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez plans on Tuesday to announce her endorsement of Marie Newman, a progressive candidate seeking to oust Representative Daniel Lipinski, a conservative-leaning Illinois Democrat, marking her first move of the 2020 campaign cycle to back a primary challenger to an incumbent. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s high-profile support amounts to a powerful seal of approval, telegraphed to her legions of ardent liberal fans, on behalf of Ms. Newman, and a reflection of the zeal of the party\u2019s progressive left to leverage its nascent power to continue targeting sitting Democrats. Ms. Newman is backed by Justice Democrats, the group that propelled Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s insurgent campaign and upset victory last year over a veteran Democratic congressman who she argued was out of step with his constituents. A businesswoman who has described herself as \u201ca real Democrat,\u201d Ms. Newman also ran in 2018 against Mr. Lipinski and lost by about 2,000 votes. \u201cMarie Newman is a textbook example of one of the ways that we could be better as a party \u2014 to come from a deep blue seat and to be championing all the issues we need to be championing,\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said in an interview. Of Mr. Lipinski, she said: \u201cThe fact that a deep blue seat is advocating for many parts of the Republican agenda is extremely problematic. We\u2019re not talking about a swing state that is being forced to take tough votes.\u201d Mr. Lipinski, 53, bills himself in his campaign ads as \u201ca workhorse, not a show horse,\u201d and the eight-term congressman, who opposes abortion rights and voted against the Affordable Care Act, has repeatedly expressed his concerns that it is \u201cdetrimental\u201d for the party to push out conservative lawmakers. He succeeded his father, William O. Lipinski, who held the seat for more than two decades before the younger Mr. Lipinski was elected in 2004. The incumbent shot back in a statement Tuesday that Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s endorsement \u201cmakes crystal clear that Ms. Newman is an extreme candidate,\u201d and added that his constituents \u201cdo not want to be represented by a fifth member of \u2018the squad,\u2019\u201d a nickname for the quartet of progressive female lawmakers in the House that includes Ms. Ocasio-Cortez. Ms. Newman, 55, a supporter of abortion rights who founded a consulting business, argues that the incumbent congressman is far more conservative than the district, a swath that includes the southwestern suburbs of Chicago. \u201cThis campaign is about putting someone in place that is in alignment directly with the district on issues like affordability for the middle class and working families, the Green New Deal,\u201d Ms. Newman said in an interview on Monday, adding that she and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez \u201cshare some very similar values.\u201d But the move also reflects a careful political calculus by Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, a Bronx Democrat. She came to Congress vowing to take down any Democrat she considered insufficiently progressive, but has, until now, refrained from taking on any of her fellow incumbents directly. In challenging Mr. Lipinski, she is targeting an incumbent Democrat, but one who has broken sharply with party orthodoxy, and has already lost the support of some of his other Democratic colleagues. The House Democrats\u2019 campaign arm in April formally broke committee business ties with political consultants and pollsters who sign on to work for primary challengers, infuriating progressive Democrats. The blacklist, Ms. Newman said, \u201cwas a very expensive issue for a while on my campaign.\u201d Progressive groups and lawmakers, however, have still flocked to support Ms. Newman. Representative Ro Khanna of California, and two Illinois lawmakers, Representative Jan Schakowsky and then-Representative Luis V. Guti\u00e9rrez, broke with party leadership in 2018 to endorse Ms. Newman, and Mr. Khanna renewed his endorsement this year. Representative Cheri Bustos of Illinois, the chairwoman of House Democrats\u2019 campaign arm, canceled a fund-raiser in support of Mr. Lipinski in May after facing a backlash from the left. Ms. Newman has also won the support of two candidates in the Democratic presidential primary, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. Ms. Warren last week announced twin endorsements of Justice Democrats candidates, backing both Ms. Newman and Jessica Cisneros, who is challenging Representative Henry Cuellar of Texas. Ms. Cisneros, who was recruited to run against Mr. Cuellar by Justice Democrats and is described by some as the next Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, has yet to win the endorsement of any sitting House Democrat. \u201cWe are so proud that Marie Newman is the first Justice Democrat of this cycle to receive an endorsement from Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,\u201d said Alexandra Rojas, the executive director of Justice Democrats. \u201cThe momentum is growing in our movement to make the Democratic Party fight for solutions as big as the problems we face and create a party that fights for its voters, not corporate donors.\u201d Until this week, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez had largely focused on helping incumbent freshmen lawmakers, like Representative Joe Neguse of Colorado, a well-liked freshman and member of Democratic leadership whom she will support at a fund-raiser in Boulder this week. In April, she rallied around some of her colleagues who flipped districts President Trump won in 2016, encouraging her Twitter followers to donate to their campaigns. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said that she would continue to assess whether she would weigh in on other primary challenges, but that she had no interest in intervening in competitive races that could tip the balance of power in the House. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to make these changes, they need to come from safe blue seats,\u201d she said.",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Less than two weeks after being sworn in last year, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a young progressive star fresh off an upset of one of the top Democratic leaders in the House, put her fellow Democrats on notice that she would soon be coming for them, too. Appearing in a promotional video for Justice Democrats \u2014 the insurgent liberal group dedicated to unseating entrenched Democratic lawmakers that helped sweep her to power \u2014 Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, a Bronx firebrand, urged her supporters to recruit candidates to run against her new colleagues. She was flanked by the group\u2019s three founders, two of whom had just taken top jobs in her office. There were even whispers that she might try to oust Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, a rising star regarded by many Democrats as a future speaker. But after nearly nine months, with her eyes now wide open to the downsides of her revolutionary reputation and social media fame, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez has tempered her brash, institution-be-damned style with something different: a careful political calculus that adheres more closely to the unwritten rules of Washington she once disdained. \u201cI think I have more of a context of what it takes to do this job and survive on a day-to-day basis in a culture that is inherently hostile to people like me,\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said in an interview. Gone from her Washington office are her original chief of staff and her communications director, two Justice Democrats founders who were intent on waging their divisive brand of politics from their offices on Capitol Hill. No longer an unabashed ambassador of the combative group, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez has carefully managed her involvement with it. And she never did go after Mr. Jeffries, now the chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, the same position held last year by Representative Joseph Crowley when Ms. Ocasio-Cortez set her sights on ousting him. Instead,  she announced on Tuesday that her first endorsement of a primary challenger to an incumbent Democrat would be Marie Newman, who is making a second run at ousting Representative Daniel Lipinski of Illinois, a conservative-leaning Democrat who is regarded by many of his colleagues as something of an outlier because of his opposition to abortion rights and his vote against the Affordable Care Act. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez is not the only Democrat to break with Mr. Lipinski and support Ms. Newman, nor is she the first. Deciding on the endorsement, she said, was in part a product of having learned to balance her twin roles as a dissident and a member of Congress. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about being an activist,\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said. \u201cIt forces you to grow. So it doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t endorse activists, but it also requires an assessment for a capacity of growth and how you navigate a space like this.\u201d When she first arrived on Capitol Hill, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and her team made it clear they planned to use their perch inside Congress as a platform for their divisive, outsider brand of politics. On her first day of orientation, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez joined protesters camped outside Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s office agitating for the Green New Deal. \u201cIt could have made people mad; they could have put me on the dog walking committee,\u201d she joked later that week on a Justice Democrats conference call promoting the organization\u2019s candidate recruitment campaign. \u201cThey still might.\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez may have meant it as an offhand quip, but her comment underscored a reality on Capitol Hill that she and her team were slow to fully appreciate: the extent to which power and the ability to get things done in the House were dependent on personal relationships and respect for the hierarchy. The first-term congresswoman enjoys rich public support outside Congress, particularly on the social media platforms where progressive activism thrives. But the approach that she and her cohorts champion \u2014 pulling the institution to the left in part by threatening the careers of any Democrats who fail to embrace their ideas \u2014 quickly alienated many of her colleagues, and has made it difficult for her to get anything done. In private conversations, many of Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Democratic colleagues routinely complain that in her zeal to build her social media celebrity and political brand, she is too quick to cast aspersions on her fellow lawmakers, painting them as apologists for the status quo. \u201cIn many ways, I feel like I walk around with a scarlet letter because many members who just have any primary, whether I know about it or not, tend to project that onto me,\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said in an interview. \u201cIn many ways, I feel like I walk through that body as a symbol of someone who should not be there and a threat to the way power is organized.\u201d She said she has gone through a \u201closs of innocence and na\u00efvet\u00e9,\u201d realizing that it was impossible to separate the legislative work of serving in Congress with the politics of re-election campaigns. \u201cThey are frankly much closer in that dynamic and much closer in overlapping than a lot of people tend to realize,\u201d she said. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez has cut back on her appearances on behalf of Justice Democrats and has begun bolstering her fellow incumbent freshman lawmakers, like Representative Joe Neguse of Colorado, a member of Democratic leadership whom she is joining at a fund-raiser this week for the Boulder County Democratic Party. In April, she rallied around some of her colleagues who flipped districts President Trump won in 2016, encouraging her Twitter followers to donate to their campaigns. She diligently reached out to the so-called majority-makers on her committees \u2014 the centrist freshmen who flipped Republican-leaning seats \u2014 to win them over. Her aides, however, continued to carry the Justice Democrats\u2019 flag without restraint, tweeting out their support when the group challenged incumbents, to the dismay of Democratic aides and lawmakers. In July, Saikat Chakrabarti, then her chief of staff, ignited a firestorm by accusing centrist Democrats of enabling \u201ca racist system\u201d after they blocked an effort to defund immigration enforcement as part of an emergency border aid package. In a tweet, now deleted, he compared them to \u201cnew Southern Democrats,\u201d a reference to segregationists. It was a remarkable breach of protocol for an unelected aide. Mr. Jeffries used the House Democrats\u2019 official Twitter account to deliver a biting warning shot in a tweet, also now deleted, that singled out Mr. Chakrabarti. Two weeks later, Mr. Chakrabarti announced he would leave the office. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s new chief of staff, Ariel Eckblad, a former aide to Senator Kamala Harris of California, is well versed in the workings of Capitol Hill and is widely seen as a sober-minded replacement. Corbin Trent, who had been handling communications for both Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s campaign and her congressional office, a highly unusual arrangement, has returned to the political side. The rift was an escalation of a feud that began days earlier when Maureen Dowd, a columnist for The New York Times, asked Ms. Pelosi about the fury from Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and three other progressive freshmen over the border aid package. The speaker noted that the group had failed to persuade any other Democrats to join them in voting against the House\u2019s version of the bill. \u201cAll these people have their public whatever and their Twitter world,\u201d Ms. Pelosi said then. \u201cBut they didn\u2019t have any following. They\u2019re four people, and that\u2019s how many votes they got.\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez fired back by saying that it was she and the progressive activists who revere her, not Ms. Pelosi, who wielded the real power in the party, and later complained about  the speaker\u2019s \u201csingling out of newly elected women of color.\u201d Mr. Chakrabarti followed up with a tweet questioning the speaker\u2019s leadership. The break ultimately led to a private, one-on-one meeting last month with Ms. Pelosi in the speaker\u2019s office, where Ms. Ocasio-Cortez appeared ready to call a truce, telling reporters, \u201cI think the speaker respects the fact that we\u2019re coming together as a party and a community.\u201d \u201cVery rarely does a member enter the House and exit the House as the same person,\u201d said former Representative Steve Israel, Democrat of New York. In freshman orientation, Mr. Israel said, representatives are asked what kind of member they want to be: an activist, a policy wonk, a political leader. \u201cYou have to grapple with choosing a lane,\u201d he said, \u201cand very often, you end up shifting lanes.\u201d But Waleed Shahid, a spokesman for Justice Democrats, said Ms. Ocasio-Cortez has never been interested in staying in just one lane. \u201cNavigating her role as a legislator and a movement builder is basically what her career is about,\u201d Mr. Shahid said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to have that theory of change with one foot in D.C. and one foot in the movement. It\u2019s really hard to do that.\u201d For Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, the process continues to be bumpy. Even with Ms. Eckblad at the helm, her office still operates in some ways more like an upstart campaign on a shoestring budget than like a congressional office. A replacement for Mr. Trent has yet to be hired, and another aide who routinely irritates rank-and-file aides and lawmakers with combative comments \u2014 like when he claimed his fellow congressional aides were elitist \u201ccareerists\u201d \u2014 is still in place. And while it is not clear how many more Justice Democrats Ms. Ocasio-Cortez will endorse, she said she was still \u201cvery wedded\u201d to the insurgent theory of change that propelled her to Congress. \u201cChange by nature takes friction,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a question of how we move through it.\u201d",

      "content": " The advertisement began with a photo of Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez bursting into flames, followed by a black-and-white image of skulls lined up on the ground. The provocative advertisement, which warned about socialism by invoking the murderous Khmer Rouge movement in Cambodia, was paid for by a Republican political action committee and aired during the Democratic primary debate on Thursday night. The televised commercial came weeks after the shooting in El Paso, where a white nationalist killed 22 people in the deadliest massacre targeting Latinos in modern American history. Since El Paso, many Latinos have said they fear for their safety, worried about future attacks by white supremacists. The group that paid for the ad, New Faces GOP, states on its website that its mission is to \u201chelp elevate the next generation of Republicans\u201d and recruit more diverse candidates. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, a New York lawmaker who is one of about 40 Latinos in Congress, has previously spoken about receiving death threats and was one of four first-term congresswoman President Trump told to \u201cgo back where you came from.\u201d Shortly after the advertisement aired, she called it \u201ca love letter to the G.O.P.\u2019s white supremacist case.\u201d By Friday morning, many critics on Twitter were calling for a boycott of ABC. Some defended the network by noting that the ad ran only on certain stations, including those owned by Sinclair Broadcast Group, which owns 193 local affiliates across the country. National groups also criticized ABC for running the advertisement, saying it promoted violence and calling it \u201ccompletely irresponsible.\u201d A spokeswoman for ABC declined to comment on Friday. On the debate stage, the Democratic candidates discussed the shooting in somber and urgent terms. Many of the candidates praised Beto O\u2019Rourke, an El Paso native, for his aggressive response to the attack. During the debate, his campaign unveiled a new website labeling Mr. Trump a white supremacist. The advertisement features Elizabeth Heng, a Republican from California\u2019s Central Valley who lost her 2018 challenge to Jim Costa, a Democrat, by 15 percentage points. \u201cThis is the face of socialism,\u201d Ms. Heng says, as a picture of Ms. Ocasio-Cortez burns. \u201cDoes Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez know the horror of socialism?\u201d Ms. Heng adds as a photo of skulls in a Khmer Rouge death camp is displayed. \u201cMy father was minutes from death in Cambodia before a forced marriage saved his life,\u201d Ms. Heng says. \u201cThat\u2019s socialism: Forced obedience.

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 For a House freshman and political neophyte, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York has proved to be remarkably adept at shaping the debate on her Democratic Party\u2019s left flank, boosting the visibility of single-payer health care through her support of \u201cMedicare for all\u201d and elevating climate change with her Green New Deal. On Wednesday, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez hopes to do for the nation\u2019s poor what she has done with health care and climate politics with the unveiling of an ambitious anti-poverty package that, among other things, would cap annual rent increases, ensure full access to social welfare programs for people with convictions and undocumented immigrants, pressure federal contractors to offer better wages and benefits, and update official poverty measurements by taking into account geographic cost-of-living variations and access to health insurance, child care, and \u201cnew necessities\u201d such as internet access. \u201cI think this really starts to approach, head on, economic injustice in America,\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said in an interview. \u201cWe are at our richest point that we\u2019ve ever been, but we\u2019ve also been our most unequal.\u201d She added, \u201cit\u2019s something that we have to talk about.\u201d Since defeating Representative Joe Crowley, a senior member of the Democratic leadership, during the 2018 primaries, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, 29, has used her social-media following \u2014 4 million followers on Instagram and more than 5 million on Twitter \u2014 and strong ties to the party\u2019s progressive wing to shift the party leftward. Her Green New Deal would move the nation\u2019s energy economy rapidly away from fossil fuels, with vague promises of guaranteed job security. Medicare for all would replace all private insurance with one government-run health care system like Britain\u2019s or Canada\u2019s. Such ideas would have once been dismissed as fringe initiatives on the far left, but many members of Congress and Democratic presidential candidates have rushed to embrace them, seeking the approval of Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and her supporters. \u201cShe\u2019s a lightning rod,\u201d said Dianne Enriquez, a director at the Center for Popular Democracy, a liberal advocacy group. \u201cI think the boldness, the ability to be innovative, the willingness to go out on a limb for what she believes is right is really what makes her an ideal champion for a lot of the issues that have gone largely ignored at the federal level.\u201d Establishment Democrats have worried that Ms. Ocasio-Cortez have moved the conversation too far to the left too fast, becoming the policy face of the party and jeopardizing the political futures of more moderate members elected last year in Republican-leaning districts. But in recent weeks, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez has pushed out her chief of staff, who had picked fights with moderate Democrats, and moved her combative communications director to her campaign. Unlike the Green New Deal, which is a gauzy congressional resolution, her anti-poverty initiative, \u201cA Just Society,\u201d is six fully formed bills, written in legislative language \u2014 another sign of serious legislative intent. She had good reason to make overtures to fellow House Democrats, who had grown weary of her staff\u2019s antagonism. Matt Bennett, the executive vice president of Third Way, a centrist Democratic organization, said Ms. Ocasio-Cortez is \u201cvastly more influential\u201d than most freshman House members. But, he added: \u201cLegislating is an inherently group activity. The question is, if she wants to move this legislation, or any that she\u2019s sponsoring, can she attract co-sponsors and votes? We\u2019ll see if she has the ability to do that as well.\u201d As the Green New Deal looked to Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s signature initiative, \u201cA Just Society\u201d echoes Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s Great Society. \u201cWith the Green New Deal, we weren\u2019t just talking about climate change; we\u2019re talking about the systems that got us to climate change,\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said. \u201cWe\u2019re addressing root causes.\u201d \u201cAnd similarly,\u201d she added, \u201cwith our Just Society package, we\u2019re not simply addressing poverty or wages. We\u2019re addressing some of the basic structural reasons that are resulting in those outcomes.\u201d Nearly 40 million people in the United States live in poverty. Even middle-class workers face a shortage of affordable housing and stagnant wages. The problems are worse for both people of color, including immigrants, and people who were formerly incarcerated. The Trump administration\u2019s response has been to tighten access to some federally funded low-income programs. The bills in Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s package seek to change the federal response. She conceded that because Democrats do not control the Senate or the White House, her intention is to lay \u201cdown a vision for when we take back both of those bodies.\u201d The Recognizing Real Poverty Act requires the secretary of health and human services, in collaboration with the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, to work with the National Academy of Sciences to change the poverty line, adjusting for family size and geographic differences in the cost of goods and services. The poverty threshold would be raised to account for health insurance costs, work expenses, child care, and consideration of new necessities such as internet access. Poverty has been \u201ca taboo word in our politics for so long,\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said. Even if they are officially above the poverty line, there are \u201cpeople who are living a quality of life on par\u201d with the impoverished, she added, \u201cbut you wouldn\u2019t see that based on our numbers because we choose not to measure it.\u201d Ms. Enriquez said housing has not been a central topic of the Democratic presidential debates, even though several contenders have released full-fledged affordable housing plans. She said she hopes that Ms. Ocasio-Cortez can help elevate the issue with one of the bills in her package, the Place to Prosper Act, which would provide tenant protections and regulate corporate landlords. That bill would cap rent increases at 3 percent a year and restrict the reasons that landlords could evict tenants. For instance, a tenant could only be evicted if they have not paid rent for two or more consecutive months, have wrecked a property, or if the landlord needs a unit to house an immediate relative. The bill would prohibit discrimination because of the source of a tenant\u2019s income and would provide funding for tenant legal representatives. The act would also mandate that landlords keep rental units in good repair. It would allocate $10 billion for fiscal years 2020 through 2029 for removing toxins. Housing in America \u201cis a crisis,\u201d she said, \u201cand it\u2019s not one that we are discussing enough at the level that we need to be discussing it.\u201d Two other bills, The Embrace Act and The Mercy in Re-Entry Act, would outlaw the denial of any federal benefit because of immigration status or a past criminal conviction. The Uplift Our Workers Act would create a \u201cworker-friendliness score\u201d for federal contractors which would consider, for example, whether the contractor offers paid overtime for those who work more than 40 hours per week, or provides predictable scheduling, paid sick leave and paid parental and family leave. None of this will be enacted in the foreseeable future. \u201cNo one questions her ability to raise awareness around an issue,\u201d Mr. Bennett said, \u201cjust because she wields her social media and mainstream media platforms very effectively. But that\u2019s not the same as getting votes on a bill.\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez acknowledged the package\u2019s ambitions. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any shortage of obstacles that we have ahead of us, but I don\u2019t think that we not do things just because they\u2019re hard,\u201d she said. \u201cIn fact, sometimes the hard things to do are the most worthwhile.\u201d",

      "content": "  [Want to get New York Today by email? Here\u2019s the sign-up.] It\u2019s Thursday. Weather: Watch out for the wind, which could have dangerously strong gusts. The high temperature might not reach 60. Alternate-side parking: In effect until Monday (Shemini Atzereth). One of the biggest pieces of political news on Tuesday night did not involve candidates sparring at the Democratic presidential debate in Ohio. It was revealed that Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the influential first-term Democrat from Queens and the Bronx, will give her coveted endorsement to a fellow progressive, Senator Bernie Sanders. The two will hold a gathering for supporters in Queens on Saturday. It will be the second major campaign event in New York City recently, after Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s rally in Washington Square Park last month, where she was endorsed by the Working Families Party. Here are some reasons Ms. Ocasio-Cortez is endorsing Mr. Sanders: They are both unabashed socialists: From his call for universal health care coverage to her campaign for a Green New Deal, both Mr. Sanders and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez have eagerly sought to push the Democratic Party further left than nearly any of their colleagues. Leaders of their generations: Mr. Sanders is 78. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez just turned 30. They both have come to be seen as the progressive voice of their generations. Our colleague Sydney Ember wrote that Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s endorsement could give Mr. Sanders a much-needed boost following his recent heart attack. Her endorsement could also ease some concerns about his age and health. They go back:  In 2016, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez was an organizer on Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez was relatively little-known at the time, and Mr. Sanders\u2019s uphill battle was ultimately unsuccessful, but she was galvanized by him. \u201cFor her, Bernie Sanders played a key role in why she got into politics in the first place,\u201d Shane Goldmacher, a political reporter for The Times, said. \u201cHe was an inspiration for her. They share more than an ideological kinship. They share a whole activist-first approach to how politics should be pursued.\u201d Recent alliances: Over the summer. Mr. Sanders proposed legislation to eliminate student debt. The issue is a priority for Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, who has openly talked about her struggle to pay off her student loans. She gave him her full support. \u201cWhat a beautiful day to liberate ourselves from student debt,\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said at the time. \u201cIt was literally easier for me to become the youngest woman in American history elected to Congress than it is to pay off my student loan debt,\u201d she said. \u201cThat should tell you everything about the state of this.\u201d What about Ms. Warren? Mr. Goldmacher said that Ms. Warren had made efforts to court Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, including having lunch together in Washington in March. But ultimately, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s deeper ties to Mr. Sanders won the day.

Young people were organizing, using tactics that were militant and community-based. The Black Panthers were in California. The Young Lords were in Chicago. And after a car ride to the Midwest, a group from East Harlem formed a New York chapter of the Young Lords. The first thing they did was hit the streets to ask their neighbors what was needed. Expecting lofty talk of revolution and systemic change, the Lords instead found that the community\u2019s needs were very straightforward. [Fifty years ago, the Young Lords evolved from a street gang to a political force.] \u201cThis place is filthy, man. It stinks. There\u2019s garbage all over,\u201d was the complaint Hiram Maristany, a founding member of the group, recalled. So, a small contingent of Young Lords \u2014 Puerto Rican youth in Spanish Harlem \u2014 went to the local Department of Sanitation office to ask for better service. \u201cThey threw us out!\u201d Mr. Maristany recalled. The Lords returned to the office and took supplies in order to do the job themselves. \u201cWe thought Sanitation would come take the trash away once we\u2019d bagged it all up for them,\u201d he said. Sanitation officials refused. So, the Young Lords and a handful of community members began dragging rusted refrigerators, old cars, mattresses and broken furniture off the corners and strewing them across Third Avenue near 110th Street. The Garbage Offensive had begun. \u201cThen we set it ablaze, man,\u201d Mr. Maristany told me, still laughing. He had grabbed his camera and begun documenting the scene. It\u2019s Thursday \u2014 make history. Dear Diary: It was a summer Saturday morning. I was riding my Vespa on the Upper East Side. I stopped at a red light at 95th Street and Park Avenue. To my right, I saw a man in his 60s drilling holes into the hood of a beat-up car. He then pushed his weight down as he inserted nails into the car. He was trying to make sure that the hood stayed shut. After a time, he stopped drilling. He looked up and noticed that I was watching him. \u201cNails,\u201d he shouted. \u201cNever enough nails.\u201d He shut a toolbox that was sitting on the hood. Nails rained down on the ground. The light changed, and I drove off slowly. \u2014 Ramy Fakhr New York Today is published weekdays around 6 a.m. Sign up here to get it by email. You can also find it at nytoday.com.

      "content": " Senator Bernie Sanders wanted a show of force to convince voters he was back from his heart attack, and he produced one on Saturday: At his first rally since the episode just two and a half weeks ago, he reveled in one of the most coveted endorsements in the Democratic Party, from Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. Drawing loud cheers from a large, enthusiastic and diverse crowd that had packed into a park in Queens next to a public housing complex, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez offered resounding words of support, for both Mr. Sanders and his influence in shaping the Democratic primary. \u201cNo one wanted to question the system, and in 2016, he fundamentally changed politics in America,\u201d she said, minutes before Mr. Sanders joined her on the stage. \u201cWe right now have one of the best Democratic presidential primary fields in a generation and much of that is thanks to the work that Bernie Sanders has done in his entire life.\u201d Mr. Sanders declared himself \u201cso delighted\u201d that Ms. Ocasio-Cortez had thrown her support behind his campaign, hailing her as \u201can inspiration to millions of young people not just here in New York but across this country who now understand the importance of political participation and standing up for justice.\u201d Mr. Sanders said the crowd exceeded the 20,000 people the campaign had secured a permit for. Campaign officials, keen to affirm Mr. Sanders\u2019s resilience and mindful of the big crowd Senator Elizabeth Warren attracted to her rally last month in Washington Square Park, said more than 25,000 people turned out. During his remarks, Mr. Sanders also briefly and somewhat indirectly, addressed his health. \u201cI am happy to report to you that I am more than ready, more ready than ever, to carry on with you the epic struggle that we face today,\u201d he said. \u201cI am more than ready to assume the office of president of the United States.\u201d \u201cTo put it bluntly,\u201d he added, \u201cI am back.\u201d It was a theme that dominated the afternoon, as progressive activists and leaders paraded onto the stage to extend their own words of encouragement. There was his wife, Jane Sanders, who declared him \u201chealthy\u201d and \u201cmore than ready to continue his lifelong struggle to fight for the working people of America.\u201d There was Michael Moore, the filmmaker, who said he was \u201cglad\u201d Mr. Sanders was 78. \u201cWe will benefit from his wisdom.\u201d And there was Tiffany Cab\u00e1n, who nearly won the Queens district attorney race earlier this year; Carmen Yulin Cruz, the mayor of San Juan, and Nina Turner, a vocal supporter at his rallies on the campaign trail. Beyond serving as a show of strength, their presence aligned with a more unifying, inclusive message his campaign is aggressively trying to project. At the end of his address, he urged audience members to look around and find someone they didn\u2019t know. Then he asked a series of questions designed to promote a sense of unity. \u201cAre you willing to fight for that person who you don\u2019t even know as much as you\u2019re willing to fight for yourself?\u201d he asked. \u201cAre you willing to fight for young people drowning in student debt even if you are not? Are you willing to fight to ensure that every American has health care as a human right even if you have good health care? Are you willing to fight for frightened immigrant neighbors even if you are native born?\u201d Last week, the Sanders campaign announced that Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, who along with Ms. Ocasio-Cortez is one of the most prominent left-wing women in Congress, had also endorsed him. The pair of endorsements jolted the primary race, signaling that Mr. Sanders was still a formidable contender just as it had increasingly seemed like a contest between Ms. Warren and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. They also shifted the conversation away from his health issues and his age, infusing his campaign with a renewed sense of vitality. \u201cThere\u2019s been some degree of criticism over all \u2014 Bernie Sanders can\u2019t win because his movement is tapped out,\u201d Faiz Shakir, Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign manager, said. \u201cThis discounted that.\u201d But if the endorsements were an obvious indication that Mr. Sanders was not ready to surrender the party\u2019s left flank to Ms. Warren, it is not clear how much they will ultimately change the race \u2014 in part because there are signs that voters are not taking their cues from endorsements. Ms. Warren, for instance, has attracted huge crowds, posted some of the biggest fund-raising numbers, and surged to the top of national and early-state polls despite lacking endorsements from a single governor, big-city mayor or senator outside her home state. At the same time, Senator Kamala Harris of California is struggling to gain momentum even though she has the backing of politicians across the country, including her state\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom. Mr. Sanders\u2019s endorsements could inject fresh energy into a campaign that in some respects needed it badly. Consistently trailing Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren in recent polls and struggling to expand his base, he spent the last two weeks facing a barrage of questions about his health. His campaign made a show of financial strength this month when it reported it had collected $25.3 million between July and September \u2014 the most of any candidate in that period \u2014 but the announcement was quickly eclipsed by the news of his heart attack. Mr. Sanders\u2019s aides are also confident that the women will motivate young people, a group that was critical to his success in 2016 and that his allies know he must win over again, both in term of perception and for actual votes. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone would question or doubt that they, more than a lot of people, have the ability to inspire young people,\u201d Mr. Shakir said, referring to Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and Ms. Omar. \u201cThat in itself is going to be tremendous.\u201d The endorsements underscore how Mr. Sanders is striving to portray himself as the candidate furthest to the left. In recent months, as support for Ms. Warren has swelled, Mr. Sanders has unveiled policy proposals that have gone beyond hers \u2014 including plans to completely eliminate student debt and medical debt, and to impose a wealth tax that would apply to more households and is steeper for rich people than the one Ms. Warren has proposed. Several Democratic officials and strategists said the endorsements of Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and Ms. Omar \u2014 and possibly Representative Rashida Tlaib of Michigan \u2014 could stoke enthusiasm among the far left and perhaps prompt some of Ms. Warren\u2019s supporters to take a second look at Mr. Sanders. But some said the endorsements might not do much to grow his existing coalition, pointing out that the two women carry a similar anti-establishment, populist message that already appeals to Mr. Sanders\u2019s voter base. Some suggested the endorsements could even help Ms. Warren by making her appear more moderate and pragmatic in comparison with Mr. Sanders. Though Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and Ms. Omar have a big following nationally, and have become preferred targets of President Trump\u2019s, their support may not help woo voters, particularly in critical early states. Jess Morales Rocketto, a Democratic strategist who worked on Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign, said that the endorsements could give Mr. Sanders a fund-raising bump and more news media attention. But she was skeptical that the new support would sway undecided voters. \u201cI don\u2019t know that a congresswoman from New York, one from Minnesota, one from Michigan are super influential to voters in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina,\u201d she said. Mr. Sanders\u2019s allies said the visual imagery alone \u2014 an older man standing with younger women of color \u2014 could be enough of a benefit, especially as he continues to fight the perception that his voter base is skewed white and male. Cori Bush, who was endorsed by Ms. Ocasio-Cortez in her unsuccessful bid for Congress last year in St. Louis, said the endorsements from the two women \u201cknocks away that whole Bernie Bro idea.\u201d She also said their support \u201cwipes away the idea that maybe he\u2019s not the progressive champion anymore.\u201d Last month, the Working Families Party, an influential liberal group that backed Mr. Sanders in 2016, endorsed Ms. Warren. The announcement infuriated his supporters. But it also sent a message: It was time for progressives to pick a side and start organizing. Maurice Mitchell, the Working Families Party\u2019s national director, dismissed the notion that the dueling endorsements would splinter the left. \u201cWe\u2019ve said from the beginning that progressives need to get involved, and that\u2019s exactly what they did,\u201d he said, referring to Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and Ms. Omar. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing for our movement that folks choose one of these candidates.\u201d Mr. Mitchell said his group \u2014 which endorsed Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s opponent, then-Representative Joseph Crowley, in the 2018 primary \u2014 planned to marshal its network of volunteers across the country to work with voters to nominate Ms. Warren. What is less obvious is the role Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and Ms. Omar will play for the Sanders campaign. Waleed Shahid, the communications director for the progressive group Justice Democrats, which helped propel Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s congressional campaign, said the two women could mobilize their own networks of volunteers and donors. He pointed to Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s influence this year in the Democratic primary for district attorney in Queens, where her support for Ms. Cab\u00e1n helped to nearly lift her to victory. And because the two congresswomen represent the activist base of the party, he said, they could galvanize progressive activists around the country. But perhaps above all, the endorsements will help dispel questions about Mr. Sanders\u2019s viability post-heart attack, he said. Already, there are some indications the strategy could be working. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it makes him seem less old,\u201d Rashaun Durden, 29, said on Saturday as he waited for Mr. Sanders\u2019s rally to begin. \u201cBut I think it shows that the young generation still wants to support him regardless of his age.\u201d ",

She has raised more than $3.4 million, is better known than some presidential candidates and handily won a district that is among the bluest in the nation. But that hasn\u2019t stopped people \u2014 lots of them \u2014\u00a0from trying to unseat her. So far, eight Republicans and three Democrats have filed to run for Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s seat in the Bronx and Queens.  Two of the Republicans have each raised more than $420,000, even though no Republican has represented the Bronx in Congress in at least 50 years. The moonshot nature of these candidacies,\u00a0and the fervor for them regardless \u2014 the candidates, in both parties, have made the rounds on Fox News and become darlings of conservative media \u2014 underscores the fame and rancor that have surrounded Ms. Ocasio-Cortez. The campaigns also highlight a broader strategy by the Republican Party: turning voters\u2019 resentment toward Ms. Ocasio-Cortez into a conduit for the party\u2019s other electoral goals. By encouraging attacks on Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, Republicans hope to inspire a trickle-down effect onto lower-profile, but much more vulnerable, Democrats. \u201cWhen she\u2019s forced to explain what she stands for and what she has pushed the Democratic Party to embrace from a policy standpoint, that is an electoral boon for Republicans,\u201d said Michael McAdams, a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee. A spokesman for Ms. Ocasio-Cortez declined to comment. The chances of an upset remain slim, despite the national attention to the race. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, with her social media savvy and outspoken advocacy for left-wing policies, has cultivated 5.5 million Twitter followers and a worshipful base of supporters who donated $1.4 million to her re-election bid between July and September alone. She has $1.91 million on hand. Progressive candidates covet her political blessing; her decision to endorse Senator Bernie Sanders for president in Queens on Saturday was seen as a major victory for his campaign. But for the challengers, running \u2014 even with a near-guarantee of defeat \u2014\u00a0has few downsides. They can raise thousands off Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s name alone; earn exposure for future campaigns; and bask in the attention, even if only for a short time. For her part, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez has used the swell of challengers as  fund-raising fodder. In an email to supporters soon after the Republican candidates\u2019 contribution numbers were reported, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s campaign announced an \u201cemergency goal\u201d of nearly $850,000 \u2014 the sum of the Republicans\u2019 hauls \u2014 for October. If met, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez would be on track to raise more than $2.5 million in the next quarter. By contrast, in New York\u2019s 15th Congressional District, which borders Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s, only one candidate has raised more than $400,000 in a quarter, even though the race is considered competitive: The incumbent, Representative Jos\u00e9 Serrano, has announced his retirement. It is unclear how much support the challengers to Ms. Ocasio-Cortez will receive from their party establishments. Traditionally, state and local parties back incumbents, but Ms. Ocasio-Cortez has rankled fellow Democrats with her and her supporters\u2019 unabashed willingness to back primary challenges against longtime officeholders. In a recent fund-raising email, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s team wrote that ever since her victory, \u201ccorporate Democrats have been waiting for their chance to strike back.\u201d The Queens County Democratic Party \u2014 the longtime power base of former Representative Joseph Crowley, whom Ms. Ocasio-Cortez defeated \u2014 did not return a request for comment on Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s primary challengers. One of the Democratic challengers, Fernando Cabrera, a New York City councilman, said he consulted the Bronx County Democratic Party\u2019s chairman, Assemblyman Marcos Crespo, before announcing his campaign. \u201cHe said, \u2018Go ahead and run,\u2019 but I don\u2019t take that as an endorsement,\u201d Mr. Cabrera said. \u201cWe\u2019re still in dialogue regarding support.\u201d Mr. Crespo, in an interview, said the county party traditionally supported incumbents. \u201cI can\u2019t envision why we would necessarily think differently about the 14th,\u201d he said, referring to Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s district. On the Republican side, resources may also be scarce, even as party leaders plan to highlight the challengers. In an opinion piece in The Washington Examiner, a conservative outlet, one writer said the national party would be \u201cinsane\u201d to put \u201cone ounce of support\u201d into the race, urging donors to focus on winnable districts instead. Mr. McAdams, of the House Republicans\u2019 campaign arm, said it was too early to say where the committee would focus its spending, but that the district would not be on its list of top targets. Still, he said the group was \u201cconstantly monitoring\u201d the race. Nick Langworthy, the chairman of the New York Republican Party, said he had not done any polling on Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s district and had not recruited any of the candidates. The 11 challengers to Ms. Ocasio-Cortez are mostly unknown, and many have no political experience. Some, after filing their candidacies, have raised no money. But a few have clearly capitalized on conservatives\u2019 fervent hatred of Ms. Ocasio-Cortez. John Cummings, a teacher and former police officer, announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination on \u201cFox & Friends\u201d; he raised $425,000 in 10 weeks, outpacing many sitting members of Congress. Scherie Murray, a Republican businesswoman and Jamaican immigrant who voted twice for Barack Obama, gave her first interview to Sean Hannity, also on Fox. She raised $424,000, and has more than 140,000 Twitter followers. Mr. Cabrera and another Democratic candidate, Badrun Khan, a self-described activist, have also appeared on Fox News. The challengers, from both parties, share largely the same criticisms of Ms. Ocasio-Cortez. They slam her opposition to bringing an Amazon headquarters to New York City, blaming her for 25,000 lost jobs; they call her too radical to represent the district; and they accuse her of being too focused on building her national profile. \u201cCongresswoman Ocasio-Cortez has done an excellent job establishing a national persona for herself,\u201d Mr. Cummings said. \u201cBut most of the people who live in the district, even Democrats I\u2019ve spoken to, feel that she\u2019s just not concerned with what goes on here.\u201d At times, it can seem the candidates are running against Ms. Ocasio-Cortez more than they are running for any particular message. In emails from Mr. Cummings\u2019s campaign to reporters, the subject lines do not include his name, describing him only as \u201cA.O.C. opponent.\u201d Ms. Murray, in the Twitter post announcing her candidacy, explained her decision succinctly: \u201cThere\u2019s a crisis in Queens and it\u2019s called A.O.C.\u201d A spokeswoman for Ms. Khan said in an email that Ms. Khan was not available for any phone interviews for almost a week. (Ms. Khan later sent written responses to a few questions.) \u201cHer unusual situation \u2014 running against A.O.C. \u2014 makes her more visible obviously than other candidates,\u201d the spokeswoman wrote. \u201cI can state with certainty that this notoriety is not what Ms. Khan is looking for,\u201d she added. Of course, that sudden visibility, coupled with the low likelihood of success, has only fueled speculation of alternate motives. Mr. Cabrera, who does not live in the district, is barred by term limits from seeking re-election to the City Council, and is rumored to want to run for Bronx borough president in 2021. Congressional candidates are not required to live in the district they represent. \u201cThis is a way to establish relationships with funders, to try to craft a message,\u201d Christina Greer, an associate professor of political science at Fordham University, said of the benefits of running against Ms. Ocasio-Cortez. \u201cThis may be a failed mission, but it sets them up to be a known quantity.\u201d Mr. Cabrera denied that he was running to raise his profile. \u201cThis is really for the soul of America, and I just couldn\u2019t stand by,\u201d he said. Of course, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, who just turned 30 and had never run for office before, is prime evidence that conventional political wisdom and party support does not always matter on Election Day. Mr. Langworthy said he could not think of another first-term member of Congress with such a high profile \u2014\u00a0and that her profile was drawing undue amounts of Republican attention. \u201cEspecially when they see an outsider like A.O.C. running and winning,\u201d Mr. Langworthy said of the challengers, \u201cthey think, \u2018Hey, maybe I can do that, too.\u2019\u201d ",

Weather: Sunny, with highs in the mid-60s. Expect a moderate breeze. Alternate-side parking: In effect until Sunday (Diwali). The crowd in Queens on Saturday was large and enthusiastic, packed into a park across the street from the nation\u2019s largest public housing project to watch as Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez endorsed Bernie Sanders for president. In his remarks, Mr. Sanders called for investment in public housing, and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and the documentary filmmaker Michael Moore echoed his progressive agenda. But in the days since, the rally has sparked an unexpected backlash from some public housing leaders, who said the Sanders campaign did little to include in the event the roughly 6,000 residents of Queensbridge Houses, the housing project across the street from where the rally was held. The Sanders team pushed back. Mike Casca, a spokesman for the campaign, told The Times that it reached out to the Queensbridge Tenant Association president days before the rally, and that it provided fliers for distribution among the development\u2019s mostly black and Hispanic residents. Still, the reactions further exposed the race and class tensions in this gentrifying slice of Queens. \u201cThese people were coming from near, far \u2014 but they weren\u2019t from Queensbridge,\u201d the tenant association president, April Simpson, told a reporter for Patch. \u201cThat rally wasn\u2019t for us.\u201d Ms. Simpson, who did not respond to requests from The Times for comment, told Patch that the Sanders campaign reached out only on Friday, and that the time of the rally conflicted with a tenants association meeting. At the event, Mr. Sanders called it \u201cabsolutely unacceptable that the largest public housing development in North America, right across the street from us, lacks decent heat and hot water and is in urgent need of repair.\u201d Ray Normandeau, who has lived in Queensbridge Houses since 1973, said he and his wife attended the event. By his estimation, a few hundred of his neighbors were there. He said the website he runs about Queensbridge featured information about the rally about a week before it occurred. To live in Queensbridge Houses and not know about the rally, Mr. Normandeau said, \u201csounds specious.\u201d He added: \u201cObviously, if 25,000 people showed up, it wasn\u2019t kept a secret.\u201d Bishop Mitchell Taylor, a community leader, said the people in the park looked \u201clike tourists.\u201d In the Patch article, he called the event \u201ca pretty white rally.\u201d Corbin Trent, a spokesman for Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s 2020 campaign, said he was proud of the Sanders team\u2019s outreach effort. \u201cI was also very proud to see public housing highlighted in both of their comments and their legislative agendas,\u201d he said. The Patch reporter, Maya Kaufman, wrote on Twitter that the Sanders campaign said it called to schedule a meeting between Mr. Sanders and Queensbridge leaders, but that Ms. Simpson said that wasn\u2019t true.

Molly Fitzpatrick writes: In Sleepy Hollow, about an hour north of Times Square, the street signs and fire trucks are orange and black. The ambulances are emblazoned with full-panel murals of the Headless Horseman. And the most famous pair of empty shoulders in American literature moonlights as Sleepy Hollow High School\u2019s unsettling mascot (go Horsemen!). For years, the village was known as North Tarrytown. The rebranding of the area began in 1996. That year, the local General Motors plant \u2014 which had once employed 4,000 workers \u2014 closed, delivering a devastating blow to the village economy. The plan was to pivot toward tourism, focusing on the most famous work of the village\u2019s most famous resident. [The headless horseman industrial complex: a story about a place in Westchester.] The village voted to rename itself Sleepy Hollow, in honor of the short story \u201cThe Legend of Sleepy Hollow,\u201d written by Washington Irving. The then-mayor, Sean Treacy, celebrated the result of the vote against the backdrop of a Headless Horseman banner: \u201cThis is now the place,\u201d he proclaimed, \u201cwhere legends are made.\u201d For Henry Steiner, the village historian who supported the name change, the opportunity was more profound. \u201cI wanted to see this community called North Tarrytown not labor under a lack of identity,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to seize this world-famous identity that had been buried.\u201d It worked. In October, about 100,000 tourists descend on the Westchester County village of 10,000. And the long-vacant General Motors site is now under construction as Edge-on-Hudson, a $1 billion residential and commercial development. \u201cWe don\u2019t want people to think that Sleepy Hollow is, year-round, all about spooky stuff, because it\u2019s not,\u201d Ken Wray, the current mayor of Sleepy Hollow, said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be the Santa\u2019s Village of Halloween.\u201d It\u2019s Wednesday \u2014 get into the spirit.

      "content": " Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the firebrand political star known for using her social media savvy to champion her progressive policies, has apologized to a former elected leader from Brooklyn who sued her for blocking him on Twitter. \u201cI have reconsidered my decision to block Dov Hikind from my Twitter account,\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat from New York, said in a statement released on Monday. \u201cMr. Hikind has a First Amendment right to express his views and should not be blocked for them.\u201d The apology was made as part of a settlement agreement in the lawsuit, which was filed by Mr. Hikind in July after a federal appeals panel ruled that President Trump, one of Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s frequent detractors, had violated the Constitution when he blocked people from following him on Twitter after they criticized him. The three-judge panel said that because Mr. Trump used his Twitter account to conduct government business, he could not bar some Americans from reading his posts or interacting with them. Like Mr. Trump, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez has used her Twitter account, @AOC, to promote her policy agenda, communicate her positions on issues and engage with the public. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez has 5.7 million followers on that Twitter account, as well as 4 million followers on Instagram, where she is also active. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez also has an official congressional account, @RepAOC, that has fewer than 200,000 followers and that she uses less frequently. Mr. Hikind, a former assemblyman from Brooklyn who founded a nonprofit group that works to fight anti-Semitism, had engaged repeatedly with Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s posts, frequently criticizing her. He said that he was blocked after he assailed her over remarks she made comparing migrant detention centers at the Texas-Mexico border to concentration camps. \u201cSuddenly, I could not be part of the conversation,\u201d Mr. Hikind said on Monday. \u201cI could not share my thoughts. My mouth was closed, shut. I could not respond.\u201d In his lawsuit, Mr. Hikind said that by denying him access to her posts on Twitter, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez had violated his First Amendment rights to free speech. In August, with the lawsuit ongoing, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said on Twitter that she had blocked fewer than 20 Twitter accounts for what she called \u201congoing harassment.\u201d \u201cPeople are free to speak whatever classist, racist, false, misogynistic, bigoted comments they\u2019d like,\u201d she added. \u201cThey do not have the right to force others to endure their harassment and abuse.\u201d On Monday, in her apology, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said that blocking Mr. Hikind \u201cwas wrong and improper and does not reflect the values I cherish.\u201d The apology was made public just one day before Ms. Ocasio-Cortez was scheduled to testify in Brooklyn federal court in the case. Mr. Hikind said that while he had been looking forward to hearing Ms. Ocasio-Cortez explain her actions, he was pleased with her statement. \u201cShe now recognizes that her decision to block me was wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat can I say? I couldn\u2019t ask for much more at this point.\u201d Elected officials at all levels and on both sides of the aisles increasingly use social media accounts to connect directly with constituents about policy or energize would-be voters during campaigns. Mr. Trump in particular has wielded Twitter as a political tool, making the social-media site central to his presidency. The Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, a nonprofit which represented a number of Twitter users who were blocked by Mr. Trump in a lawsuit against him, has argued that these activities effectively turn social media into a public forum that requires open access. Numerous judges have agreed, as did Mr. Hikind. \u201cEvery public official needs to unblock the public from following them on Twitter,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cYou want to be in elected office? Don\u2019t be afraid of what people have to say to you.\u201d In a statement, The Knight First Amendment Institute celebrated Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s apology. \u201cWe hope that other public officials who are blocking critics from their social media accounts take Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s lead,\u201d said Katie Fallow, a senior staff attorney for the institute. At least two other people who said they were blocked by Ms. Ocasio-Cortez had filed complaints in federal court against her. Both cases were still ongoing, according to court records. In her statement, Ms. Ocasio Cortez did not rule out ever blocking users from following her on Twitter in the future. \u201cI reserve the right to block users who engage in actual harassment or exploit my personal/campaign account, @AOC, for commercial or other improper purposes,\u201d she said. The appeals court ruling against Mr. Trump did not stop elected officials from acting to prevent threats, abuse or harassment.",

      "content": " CORALVILLE, Iowa \u2014 It was her first visit to Iowa, but Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez bounded onstage like she was speaking to a hometown crowd in Queens. \u201cAre you all ready for a revolution?\u201d she said, as rap lyrics in Spanish rang through the crowd. \u201cI sure am.\u201d Her question was a fitting prelude for the man Ms. Ocasio-Cortez was there to introduce: Bernie Sanders, who has been pushing a similarly insurgent message for decades. Like Mr. Sanders, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, the congresswoman from New York, spoke of solidarity. Like him, she name-dropped Franklin D. Roosevelt. \u201cWhen people try to accuse us of going too far left \u2014 we\u2019re not pushing the party left,\u201d she said, to raucous applause, \u201cWe are bringing the party home.\u201d On a two-day swing through Iowa this weekend Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and Mr. Sanders, the senator from Vermont, traversed the state in tandem, an unlikely duo separated in age by nearly half a century, spreading their ideology in an unlikely place. They held rallies in Council Bluffs on the state\u2019s conservative western edge and in Coralville, near the liberal home of the University of Iowa. They hosted a climate change forum in Des Moines. The trip was their first together since Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, 30, endorsed Mr. Sanders, 78, last month, a decision that immediately jolted the Democratic primary and injected fresh energy into his campaign. Less than three weeks after he suffered his heart attack, they held an enormous rally in New York City that both demonstrated his political strength and deflected attention away from his health and age. Now, as Mr. Sanders reboots his campaign and prepares for an all-out push in Iowa, he is on a quest to lure the progressive left to him and away from Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and to convince the country that they need a wholesale revolution rather than \u201cbig, structural change.\u201d In Iowa, having Ms. Ocasio-Cortez by his side could prove a powerful weapon, as he and Ms. Warren remain locked in an intense battle to win over progressive caucusgoers with political appeals and policy plans. Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign is confident that Ms. Ocasio-Cortez will help motivate young people, a group that was critical to his success in 2016 but is now also excited by Ms. Warren, as well as the entrepreneur Andrew Yang. His advisers are also betting that her support, and the endorsements of Representatives Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, will help counter the criticism that he is running a campaign that appeals only to white, young men. Indeed, Mr. Sanders and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez cut a striking image: An older Jewish man from Brooklyn alongside a young woman of color from the Bronx \u2014 the standard-bearer of the American left and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 \u2014 together in the Midwest to share their message of democratic socialism. Even Mr. Sanders, who takes politics more seriously than most, couldn\u2019t resist cracking a joke about their partnership. \u201cPeople sometimes say that Alexandria and I are an odd couple, that she is so old and I am so young,\u201d he said in Council Bluffs on Friday night. \u201cBut that\u2019s okay. I\u2019m not an ageist.\u201d At all of three of their public events in Iowa, the atmosphere was festive, with little of the paternal scolding that can sometimes characterize Mr. Sanders\u2019s speeches. There were no homemade signs \u2014 the campaign does not allow them, fearing they could block the view for TV cameras \u2014 but there was a silhouette of Mr. Sanders\u2019s head projected onto a wall in Coralville. Onstage, Mr. Sanders and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez clasped hands, raising them together \u2014 him beaming like a proud professor, albeit one who seemed to understand he might soon be eclipsed by his student; her commanding an audience that was at once rapt and ebullient. \u201cI cannot think of any member of Congress who has done more within one year to fundamentally transform American politics,\u201d Mr. Sanders said in Council Bluffs. Yet what remains unclear, even after her positive reception this weekend, is whether Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and the political ideology that she and Mr. Sanders embrace resonates beyond Iowa\u2019s more liberal pockets. Mr. Sanders is still running third in most polls, faces formidable competition from Ms. Warren for progressive voters and is likely to endure nagging doubts about his fitness right up until the first Iowans caucus on Feb. 3. \u201cIt plays moderately well in blue areas, but far less well in areas that voted Republican in 2016,\u201d said Steven Drahozal, the Democratic chair in Dubuque County, Iowa, which narrowly voted for Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton. \u201cThey have been painted as socialists, and that turns off many moderate and Republican voters.\u201d But if Iowans are used to seeing Mr. Sanders, they are less used to seeing Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, and several attendees expressed particular enthusiasm for catching their first in-person glimpse of her. \u201cEveryone loves Bernie and especially A.O.C.,\u201d said George Holtz, 18, as he waited for the rally in Coralville to begin. \u201cI\u2019m excited to see him but I\u2019m really mostly here for her.\u201d A student at the University of Iowa, Mr. Holtz said he was still trying to decide whether to caucus for Mr. Sanders or Ms. Warren. But he said that Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s support for Mr. Sanders was swaying him, particularly because of what it signaled about her appreciation for his policies to combat climate change. \u201cIf Alexandria is supporting him, then I feel like I should too,\u201d he said. His friend, Isabella O\u2019Connor, 19, was equally enthused about Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, even though she was an intern on Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign. \u201cI loooove A.O.C.,\u201d she said. \u201cA.O.C. is my role model. She inspires me in a way that I haven\u2019t seen. And that\u2019s because she is young and she is unapologetic and she is unafraid. I respect her so much.\u201d Before the climate change forum in Des Moines, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez canvassed for Mr. Sanders, going door-to-door to speak directly with caucusgoers. During her public appearances with him, she at times seemed to dazzle the audience with her stage presence and her elegant political phrasing. \u201cThis is not about something that we allow to happen to us,\u201d she said at the rally in Council Bluffs, which drew a significant number of people from more liberal Omaha. \u201cWe don\u2019t let this race happen to us. We don\u2019t watch the presidential race. This is not a movie. This is a movement.\u201d She also subtly hinted at her own political ambitions. \u201cI\u2019m here today in Iowa because I want to grow, because I want to learn,\u201d she said at one point. \u201cBecause I want to learn about your fight so that I can take that and stitch it together with the Bronx and stitch it together with Baltimore and stitch it together with rural upstate New York and stitch it together with our black brothers and sisters in the South.\u201d It was a message that left an impression with audience members like Vivian Banderas, a 27-year-old from Omaha, who said after the rally that she had \u201cstarted crying when Alexandria was talking about her story and her struggle.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s just amazing to see someone with that background up onstage,\u201d she said, calling the partnership between Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and Mr. Sanders a \u201cdream team.\u201d Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign boasted repeatedly about their crowds this weekend, saying he and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez spoke to thousands of people in their two days in Iowa. But nowhere was it more apparent than in Coralville on Saturday night which of the speakers many of them had come to see: As soon as Ms. Ocasio-Cortez finished speaking, people began to head out the door.",

      "content": " WESTERVILLE, Ohio \u2014 Representative Ilhan Omar endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont for the Democratic presidential nomination on Tuesday, and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez will endorse Mr. Sanders at a rally this weekend, according to his campaign. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York and a star of the progressive left, will join Mr. Sanders at his \u201cBernie\u2019s Back\u201d rally in Queens on Saturday. Earlier Tuesday, his campaign had teased that Mr. Sanders would have a \u201cspecial guest\u201d at the event. News of the endorsements came as the Democratic presidential candidates were wrapping up their appearances in the fourth debate of the primary season. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s planned endorsement was first reported by The Washington Post. The endorsements, which come just two weeks after Mr. Sanders suffered a heart attack in Las Vegas, are likely to provide a much-needed boost to Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign. They could also serve to quell some concerns about his health and his age. \u201cBernie is leading a working-class movement to defeat Donald Trump that transcends generation, ethnicity and geography,\u201d Ms. Omar, Democrat of Minnesota, said in a statement. She cited the bill she and Mr. Sanders introduced in June to cancel all of the country\u2019s student debt, worth about $1.6 trillion, and praised him for working to end foreign wars. \u201cI believe Bernie Sanders is the best candidate to take on Donald Trump in 2020,\u201d she said. In his own statement, Mr. Sanders called Ms. Omar \u201ca leader of strength and courage.\u201d Mr. Sanders, 78, has been recovering since his heart attack, first at a hospital and then at his home in Burlington, Vt. The debate on Tuesday night in Westerville, Ohio, just outside of Columbus, was his first appearance before a national audience since the episode. Mr. Sanders\u2019s health issues have cast a degree of uncertainty over his campaign and left his aides rushing to reassure voters about his age and health, just as he was trying to improve his standing in a race that in recent weeks has become more of a two-person contest between Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. Asked about his health directly at the debate on Tuesday night, Mr. Sanders nodded to the rally and to the \u201cspecial guest.\u201d \u201cLet me invite you all to a major rally we\u2019re having in Queens,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a special guest at that event, and we are going to be mounting a vigorous campaign all over this country.\u201d He also said, \u201cI\u2019m feeling great.\u201d Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign is billing the New York rally as his official return to the campaign trail. It had toyed with holding the rally in Prospect Park in Brooklyn, according to an aide, but settled on a park in Queens, with a backdrop of the Manhattan skyline. Presidential endorsements from the congresswomen, both members of the group of first-term Democratic women of color known as \u201cthe squad,\u201d were highly coveted. In addition to being among the country\u2019s most prominent progressives, the members of the group \u2014 Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, Ms. Omar, Representative Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Representative Ayanna S. Pressley of Massachusetts \u2014  have also become some of President Trump\u2019s favorite foils. Assorted news reports said that Ms. Tlaib planned to endorse Mr. Sanders as well, and early Wednesday Ms. Omar tweeted that Ms. Tlaib was backing him. Ms. Tlaib\u2019s team did not respond to requests for comment, and Mr. Sanders\u2019s aides did not confirm that Ms. Tlaib had endorsed him. In a statement, an aide to Ms. Pressley said: \u201cAyanna has tremendous respect for her sisters-in-service. Ultimately, these political decisions are made as individuals. Ayanna knows that taking back the White House in 2020 is a top priority, and she is working everyday to hold this Administration accountable.\u201d Last month, Ms. Warren won the endorsement of the Working Families Party, a progressive group that endorsed Mr. Sanders during the last presidential cycle. The endorsement was a boon to Ms. Warren\u2019s candidacy as she aimed to position herself as Mr. Biden\u2019s main rival and the standard-bearer for the progressive left. But it also unnerved supporters of Mr. Sanders, who criticized the endorsement process.",

      "content": " Hair has once again caused a political tempest in a blow dryer. This week, the Washington Times published a story saying that Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez had spent $80 on a haircut and $180 on color at a Washington, D.C. salon, a styling choice the newspaper presented as hypocritical, given she \u201cregularly rails against the rich and complains about the cost of living inside the Beltway.\u201d Almost immediately, charges of sexism and superficiality began to fly online (also, a debate about the average price of a woman\u2019s haircut, and how little men seem to understand the cost of certain aspects of life). Ms. Ocasio-Cortez herself tweeted out a statement, saying that Vice President Mike Pence \u201cused *taxpayer funds* \u2014 not personal ones \u2014 to spend several thousand haircuts\u2019 worth of public money on a visit to Trump golf courses.\u201d It would be easy to dismiss this as mere distraction, except it is also the latest in a long line of hair-related controversies in the corridors of power that have surrounded both men and women. Hair is, it seems, a particularly \u2014 well, tangled, subject. Not to mention an equal-opportunity target. Hillary Clinton acknowledged it in 2014, when she joked that the subtitle of her memoir, \u201cHard Choices,\u201d should be \u201cThe Scrunchie Chronicles: 112 Countries and It\u2019s Still All About My Hair.\u201d Though Mrs. Clinton is probably the most famous hair lightning rod, whether it was her chopping and changing while in the White House as first lady (seen as reflecting the opportunism of her husband\u2019s policies), her I-don\u2019t-care-I\u2019m-getting-down-to-work scrunchies as secretary of state, her John Barrett styling trip while on the campaign trail (average price per cut: $600) or her postelection lank and limp blues, she is far from the only politician scrutinized. Her husband was also mocked as far back as 1993 for having a plane wait on the tarmac in Los Angeles while he received a trim from Cristophe of Beverly Hills. The New York Times reported: \u201cQuestions about Mr. Clinton\u2019s runway razor cut dominated the White House news briefing today, with the communications director, George Stephanopoulos, scrambling to explain why the populist President tied up one of the country\u2019s busiest airports to have his hair trimmed.\u201d John Edwards, of course, became something of a poster boy for follicular faux pas during the 2007 presidential campaign when it was revealed he had indulged in two haircuts totaling approximately $800 at a time when he was attempting to sell himself as a champion for working class Americans. It\u2019s not just an American obsession. In 2016, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, then the president of France, came under fire for a reported $10,000 a month styling bill, which was seen as inappropriate for a socialist (it even got its own hashtag: #Coiffuregate). During the 2015 Canadian election, Justin Trudeau\u2019s hair, which, in its lushness, seemed to represent his youth and privilege, had its own Twitter account \u2014 @TrudeausHair. The Economist referred to him as the \u201chair apparent\u201d (a reference to his father, former Prime Minister Pierre-Elliott Trudeau). And he wasn\u2019t the only one under a follicular microscope: the hair of all the (all-male) candidates played a fairly public role in that election. And British Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s singular flyaway blondness has inspired RTE, the Irish broadcaster, to write that his hair is \u201ckey\u201d to his \u201cpolitical brand,\u201d \u201csymbolizing the chaotic and gaffe-prone style that charms his supporters and appals his critics.\u201d It\u2019s fair to say hair is not just some stringy stuff on the top of our heads. According to Grant McCracken, an anthropologist and author of \u201cBig Hair,\u201d our hair is \u201cour court of deliberation, the place where we contemplate who and what we are.\u201d It is visible, accessible, gender-freighted. It has associations with sex, punishment, class and power. It is probably not happenstance that the United States has not elected a bald president since Dwight D. Eisenhower left office in 1961. When it comes to politics, to care too much about hair, to spend too much on it, makes one seen as superficial and vain; focused on yourself at the expense (literally sometimes) of taxpayers. Ignore it and you are sloppy and lack attention to detail. Men have traditionally used their ability to get inexpensive barber-trims as bragging rights and something of a badge of honor. In the Washington Times story, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions is lauded for the fact he got his cuts at the Senate Hair Care Services in the basement of the Russell Senate Office Building for a mere $20 \u2014 though it is acknowledged that \u201cmen\u2019s haircuts there and everywhere else are cheaper than women\u2019s.\u201d In turn, women have often complained about a double standard in price and scrutiny. This has only become more true in the age of Instagram, and during a White House administration where hair has played an outsize symbolic role, from the glossy, blow-dried locks of pretty much all the women in the Trump orbit (the first lady, Tiffany Trump, Vanessa Trump, Kimberly Guilfoyle, Hope Hicks \u2014 and Ivanka before the bob) to the orange-hued and complicated comb-over worn by the president himself. People joke about it, but no one forgets it. Fact is, we\u2019re talking about hair more than ever these days, not less. All of which suggests that, whether we like it or not, when it comes to politics (as when it comes to a lot of life), a trim is rarely just a trim. It\u2019s a weapon, and a tool. If we don\u2019t admit that and wield it ourselves \u2014 with humor, ideally \u2014 then someone else will.",
