      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 In recent days, lawmakers were told that when President Trump ramped up his campaign to pressure Ukraine into helping him against his domestic political rivals, he directed advisers to his personal lawyer. \u201cTalk with Rudy,\u201d he instructed. But one thing lawmakers will not do is talk with Rudy. Rudolph W. Giuliani was hardly the only offstage character during two weeks of impeachment hearings that ended on Thursday. Lawmakers also heard that Mike Pence and Mike Pompeo were in the loop, that Mick Mulvaney organized the political equivalent of a \u201cdrug deal\u201d and that John R. Bolton was adamantly against it. But among those missing from the House Intelligence Committee\u2019s witness list, besides Mr. Giuliani, were Mr. Pence, Mr. Pompeo, Mr. Mulvaney and Mr. Bolton. Not that the panel\u2019s Democratic majority was necessarily uninterested in talking with the vice president, secretary of state, acting White House chief of staff or former national security adviser. Democratic leaders have decided not to wage a drawn-out fight to force them to testify over White House objections. Instead, as the committee wrapped up its public hearings on Thursday, House Democrats have opted for expeditious over comprehensive, electing to complete their investigation even without filling in major gaps in the story. It is a calculated gamble that they have enough evidence to impeach Mr. Trump on a party-line vote in the House and would risk losing momentum if they took the time to wage a court fight to compel reluctant witnesses to come forward. But it leaves major questions unresolved. Was Mr. Pence told about a suspected link between security aid and investigations of Mr. Trump\u2019s political opponents, as one witness testified? Did Mr. Pompeo sign off on it? Did Mr. Mulvaney facilitate the scheme? Did Mr. Bolton ever bring his objections directly to the president? Several current and former officials rushed out statements through aides or lawyers taking issue with testimony about them, but none of them volunteered to offer their own versions of the truth under oath. Democrats have concluded that in the face of White House refusal to cooperate, it is better to press ahead and simply address the refusal of witnesses like Mr. Mulvaney to testify as a plank in a possible article of impeachment alleging obstruction of Congress. \u201cThey should be coming before us,\u201d Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Thursday. \u201cThey keep taking it to court, and no, we\u2019re not going to wait until the courts decide. That might be information that\u2019s available to the Senate, in terms of how far we go and when we go. But we can\u2019t wait for that because, again, it\u2019s a technique. It\u2019s obstruction of justice, obstruction of Congress.\u201d Even some Republican strategists said she had a point. \u201cAs a political matter, the longer this goes, it is a real opportunity for Republicans to paint Democrats as unconcerned about the issues voters care more about, and I think Nancy Pelosi is well aware of that,\u201d said Brendan Buck, who was counselor to former Speaker Paul D. Ryan. But it leaves some frustrated about the missing pieces. \u201cAn impeachable offense should be compelling, overwhelmingly clear and unambiguous,\u201d said Representative Will Hurd of Texas, one of the few Republicans willing to criticize the president and at one point seen as theoretically open to the possibility of impeachment. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not something to be rushed or taken lightly. I have not heard evidence proving the president committed bribery or extortion.\u201d With the White House defying the House, Mr. Mulvaney has refused to comply with a subpoena for his testimony while Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Pence and Mr. Pompeo have defied subpoenas for documents but not been asked for testimony. Mr. Bolton has declined an invitation to testify and has not been subpoenaed but is awaiting the result of a lawsuit filed by his former deputy, Charles M. Kupperman, asking a judge to decide whether he should listen to the House or the White House. That case is due for oral arguments in a Federal District Court in Washington on Dec. 10, but even if the judge rules quickly it could be appealed all the way to the Supreme Court, which would take time. Another lawsuit seeking to force Donald F. McGahn II, the former White House counsel, to testify in response to an earlier House subpoena in a previous matter may be decided by a judge on Monday. But it too could be appealed, and Mr. Bolton\u2019s lawyer has suggested that it might not apply to his client since there are separate national security concerns at stake. None of which would suit the fast-track timetable envisioned by House Democrats. Although more witnesses could still be called, the Intelligence Committee concluded its scheduled public hearings after 12 witnesses and will now focus on drafting a report on the matter. It could also use the coming days to renew its press for the administration to turn over long-sought documents that have become more significant in light of the testimony. From there, the committee\u2019s report will go to the House Judiciary Committee, which traditionally handles impeachment and will then hold hearings of its own, but generally on constitutional and legal issues rather than fact-finding of its own. After it drafts articles of impeachment, the committee would vote on them and send them to the House floor, where Democrats anticipate a vote by Christmas. In theory, if witnesses like Mr. Bolton do agree to testify or are compelled by a court, they could still be called before the Judiciary Committee. And for that matter, if the House does impeach Mr. Trump and sends the case to the Senate for a trial that would open sometime after the new year, additional witnesses could still be called then, too. But the two weeks of public hearings showed how much remains fluid. Gordon D. Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union and a key figure in the pressure campaign, amended his original closed-door testimony after other witnesses contradicted him. Others like William B. Taylor Jr., the acting ambassador to Ukraine; Kurt D. Volker, the special envoy for Ukraine; and Laura K. Cooper, a Defense Department official, offered new information after their original interviews when reminded by their staff or other witnesses. Some of those who have not testified are aggrieved at their portrayals over the last two weeks. Mr. Mulvaney protested testimony on Thursday by Fiona Hill, a former Bolton deputy, that put him at the center of the pressure campaign. \u201cFiona Hill\u2019s testimony is riddled with speculation and guesses about any role that Mr. Mulvaney played with anything related to Ukraine,\u201d his lawyer, Robert N. Driscoll, said in a statement. But the statement did not explain what role he did play, leaving the committee to guess. In Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s case, he has made statements that Democrats, at least, will consider evidence even if it was not under oath. During a briefing for reporters last month, Mr. Mulvaney admitted that Mr. Trump suspended $391 million in American security aid to Ukraine in part to force Ukraine to investigate a debunked conspiracy theory involving Democrats during the 2016 presidential campaign. Mr. Mulvaney later tried to take it back. Those comments as well as statements by the offices of officials like Mr. Pence and Energy Secretary Rick Perry raise the question of whether they have effectively waived any claim of immunity from testifying because they have publicly addressed the matter, according to lawyers. But Democrats may not take the time to litigate the question. Representative Tom Malinowski, a New Jersey Democrat who serves on the Foreign Affairs Committee that was involved in the Ukraine investigation at an earlier stage, pointed to Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s public acknowledgment about the link between aid and an investigation as well as other testimony about figures like Mr. Bolton and Mr. Pompeo. \u201cI very much want to hear from them,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if they lack the courage of their colleagues to testify under oath, we can assume that what we\u2019ve learned about their views and actions is true.\u201d An impeachment proceeding is not the same as a criminal court process, of course, and the standard of evidence is not the same. The House can move forward with whatever evidence a majority considers sufficient. And to the extent that the processes can be compared, an impeachment would be the political equivalent of an indictment, signaling that there is enough evidence to merit a trial in the Senate, though not necessarily enough to convict. Still, even in the relatively quick investigation conducted in the two months since Ms. Pelosi formally opened the impeachment inquiry, the basic facts of what happened have been established and to a greater or lesser degree verified by different witnesses. \u201cThe reality is there\u2019s not much ambiguity about what took place here,\u201d Mr. Buck said. \u201cWe know what happened, and now members and voters have to decide whether it rises to the level of removing him.\u201d",

Kirkpatrick and Eric LiptonPRINT EDITIONFamily Ties Link Power in Ankara And Washington|November 13, 2019, Page A1",
      "author": "David D. Kirkpatrick",
      "content": "  ISTANBUL \u2014 Behind President Trump\u2019s accommodating attitude toward Turkey is an unusual back channel: a trio of sons-in-law who married into power and now play key roles in connecting Ankara with Washington. One, Turkey\u2019s finance minister, is the son-in-law of its strongman president and oversees his country\u2019s relationship with the United States. Another is the son-in-law of a Turkish tycoon and became a business partner to the Trump Organization. Now he advocates for Turkey with the Trump administration. And the third is Jared Kushner, who as the son-in-law of and senior adviser to Mr. Trump has a vague if expansive foreign policy portfolio. Operating both individually and in tandem, the three men have developed an informal, next-generation line of communication between Mr. Trump and his Turkish counterpart, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who only weeks after his military incursion into northern Syria is scheduled to visit the White House on Wednesday. At a moment when Mr. Trump has come under bipartisan criticism from Congress for a series of stands favorable to Mr. Erdogan, the ties among the three men show how informal and often-unseen connections between the two presidents have helped shape American policy in a volatile part of the world. Mr. Erdogan predicted in a television interview this year that a private dialogue between Berat Albayrak, his son-in-law and finance minister, and Mr. Kushner would soon put \u201cback on track\u201d the vexed relations between Washington and Ankara. \u201cThe bridge works well in this manner,\u201d Mr. Erdogan said. \u201cBackdoor diplomacy,\u201d Mr. Albayrak called his work with Mr. Kushner. Mr. Trump\u2019s policy toward Turkey has confounded his fellow Republicans in Congress on a number of fronts. Mr. Trump twice surprised his own advisers by agreeing during phone calls with Mr. Erdogan to pull United States troops from northern Syria \u2014 and the second time, in early October, he followed through, clearing the way for Turkish forces to attack an American-backed militia there. Critics say the Trump administration has balked at aggressively punishing a state-owned Turkish bank for evading American sanctions against Iran. Mr. Trump has also deferred legally mandated sanctions against Turkey, a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, for installing Russian missile defense systems. Speaking last week at a closed-door presentation hosted by Morgan Stanley, John R. Bolton, the former national security adviser, said Mr. Trump often confuses personal relationships with national relationships when it comes to setting policy. He cited as an example the president\u2019s reluctance to confront Mr. Erdogan by imposing sanctions on Turkey over the Russian weapons purchase, a person who was in the room for his presentation said on Tuesday after NBC News reported a version of Mr. Bolton\u2019s remarks. On the Russian missiles, banking sanctions and other matters, Mr. Erdogan has deployed both his own son-in-law and Mr. Trump\u2019s Turkish business partner, Mehmet Ali Yalcindag, as emissaries to the administration, sometimes through Mr. Kushner, according to Turkish officials and public records. In April, for example, Mr. Albayrak had come to Washington for a conference organized by Mr. Yalcindag at the Trump International Hotel. And in the middle of the event, Mr. Kushner summoned Mr. Albayrak to an impromptu meeting in the Oval Office, where Mr. Albayrak successfully pressed Mr. Trump to hold back the sanctions against Turkey for buying Russian weapons. Both leaders appear to favor family or business connections as back channels, several advisers to Mr. Erdogan said, in part because both share a suspicion that the agencies of their own governments may be conspiring against them. The term \u201cdeep state,\u201d in fact, first emerged in Turkey decades ago, long before it came into vogue among Trump supporters, and Mr. Erdogan\u2019s advisers say he has cultivated Mr. Trump by emphasizing their shared struggles against such entrenched forces within their governments. \u201cThe U.S. has an established order that we can call a deep state \u2014 of course they are obstructing,\u201d Mr. Erdogan said this spring, explaining his hopes for the \u201cbridge\u201d between sons-in-law. \u201cThese obstructions are one of our main troubles.\u201d Turkey is not the only case where Mr. Trump has applied an unusually informal, family-to-family approach to foreign policy. Mr. Kushner, for instance, has also played a role in managing relations with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia, the de facto ruler and favorite son of the king. \u201cTrump is replacing formal relations among nations in several cases with family-to-family relationship, or crony-to-crony relationships,\u201d said Eric S. Edelman, who served as under secretary of defense for policy and United States ambassador to Turkey during the George W. Bush administration. \u201cCertainly Erdogan would prefer that kind of relationship as he runs a crony capitalist regime of his own,\u201d Mr. Edelman said. \u201cBut it ought to be a matter of concern to all Americans.\u201d Mr. Erdogan and Mr. Trump are hardly natural partners. Mr. Erdogan is a champion of political Islam who often argues that the West is in decline. Mr. Trump is a fierce nationalist who has often denigrated Muslims and especially political Islamists. Mr. Trump has closely allied himself with some of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s greatest foes \u2014 including the rulers of Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates as well as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel. Mr. Trump\u2019s ties to Turkey, though, go back more than a decade, beginning with an invitation from Mr. Yalcindag to do business in Istanbul. Mr. Yalcindag\u2019s father-in-law, the tycoon Aydin Dogan, had set out to build two skyscrapers and a shopping mall. Mr. Yalcindag, now 55, convinced him that the family company should find an international partner. Mr. Yalcindag had negotiated to use the name \u201cCNN Turk\u201d for the family\u2019s television news network, and he flew to New York to sell Mr. Trump on lending his name to the Istanbul towers. The skyscrapers, which opened in 2012 as Trump Towers Istanbul, pay the Trump Organization only a licensing fee \u2014 $5 million to $10 million a year in the first years after it opened, and down to $100,000 to $1 million a year in more recent years \u2014 according to Mr. Trump\u2019s financial disclosure forms. But the buildings were the first residential and commercial towers in Europe to hang the Trump name, and both families considered them a success. Mr. Erdogan, then prime minister, cut the ribbon. Mr. Trump; his eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump; and her husband, Mr. Kushner, all attended the opening along with Mr. Yalcindag, who became a friend of their family. \u201cMy daughter loves Turkey, and she loves Istanbul, and she really always enjoyed coming here, and she\u2019s been here many times,\u201d Mr. Trump said at the ceremony in Istanbul. \u201cHer great friend is Mehmet,\u201d Mr. Trump added, referring to Mr. Yalcindag as having \u201cdone some unbelievable job.\u201d He praised Mr. Erdogan at length as \u201ca good man\u201d who was \u201cvery highly respected throughout the world and in the United States.\u201d For the past decade, Mr. Yalcindag has typically seen Mr. Trump socially about three or four times a year, according to a person close to the family. Mr. Trump, as he ran for president, acknowledged that his personal relationships influenced his view of Turkey. \u201cI have a little conflict of interest because I have a major, major building in Istanbul,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a radio interview in 2015, gushing that it was \u201ca tremendously successful job.\u201d When Mr. Trump pledged to ban Muslims from entering the United States, Mr. Erdogan briefly called for the removal of the Trump name from the towers. But heeding advice about the value of good relations with Washington, he never followed through. Mr. Erdogan\u2019s advisers assumed Mr. Trump would lose in 2016. But Mr. Yalcindag flew 10 hours to be with Mr. Trump and his family at the New York Hilton Midtown while the votes were counted. Frantic to reach the new president-elect the next day, the Turkish Embassy in Washington eventually turned in desperation to Mr. Yalcindag for the telephone number of Trump headquarters \u2014 beginning his new role as a go-between for Ankara. Mr. Erdogan knew Mr. Yalcindag from Turkish business circles, and he had reportedly collaborated with Mr. Erdogan\u2019s son-in-law on a campaign to influence the Turkish news media. On the strength of his ties to the Trump family, Mr. Erdogan also named Mr. Yalcindag to a new role as chairman of a state-run business group that lobbies Washington on behalf of Ankara. The group\u2019s previous chairman, Ekim Alptekin, had run afoul of American prosecutors by  paying more than $500,000 to the consulting firm of the retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, who went on to become Mr. Trump\u2019s first national security adviser. Prosecutors said Mr. Alptekin was paying Mr. Flynn to lobby the Turkish government, and they eventually indicted him for violating lobbying disclosure rules and for lying to investigators. (Mr. Alptekin has not returned to the United States to face trial.) Taking over as the face of the state-sponsored Turkey-U.S. Business Council after Mr. Trump\u2019s election, Mr. Yalcindag began to travel regularly to Washington. The council for the first time held its annual conferences at the Trump hotel in Washington, generating hundreds of thousands of dollars of revenue for the hotel while pulling in top Trump administration officials as speakers. During a visit this year, Mr. Yalcindag also made stops on Capitol Hill and at the State Department, not only to lobby on trade policy but on an array of other issues, as well. In one State Department meeting, according to a person present, his agenda included pushing for the extradition of the Pennsylvania-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, accused by Mr. Erdogan of promoting the 2016 coup attempt against him; pleading for the United States to quietly settle the sanctions case against the Turkish bank with a limited fine; arguing for the sale of Patriot missiles to reduce Turkey\u2019s need for Russian alternatives; and making the case for a Turkish takeover of northern Syria. At times, Mr. Yalcindag implicitly threatened that Turkey might move closer to Moscow. \u201cYou might not consider Turkey at the moment as your best friend,\u201d he told the Americans, according to a person who attended the meeting. \u201cBut it would be a shame to lose a longstanding ally.\u201d Mr. Albayrak, 41, is often referred to in Turkey simply as \u201cthe groom.\u201d But he acquired a new nickname after Mr. Trump\u2019s election: Erdogan\u2019s Kushner. The son of a journalist close to Mr. Erdogan, Mr. Albayrak lived in New York early in his career. He earned a business degree at Pace University while working for the American division of one of Turkey\u2019s biggest conglomerates, Calik Holding. He married the president\u2019s daughter Esra in 2004, and he was named chief executive of Calik three years later. By 2015, Mr. Erdogan helped Mr. Albayrak, then 37, to win a seat in Parliament and named him energy minister. But Mr. Albayrak\u2019s influence rose even more rapidly after a faction of military leaders attempted a coup against Mr. Erdogan in July 2016. Mr. Albayrak joined his father-in-law on a jet circling the skies over Turkey while Mr. Erdogan used his iPhone to rally his supporters. (A live interview by FaceTime with CNN Turk, founded by Mr. Yalcindag, helped turn the tide.) After surviving the coup attempt, Mr. Erdogan responded by purging perceived enemies and silencing dissent. Mr. Albayrak spearheaded the crackdown. He was quickly elevated to the role of finance minister. But Mr. Albayrak acquired so much clout that some, including cabinet members, described him as a shadow premier. He helped orchestrate a takeover of a large portion of the Turkish news media, much of which is now under the control of his younger brother, Serhat Albayrak. (Both brothers over the years have also worked closely with Mr. Yalcindag.) At the same time, Berat Albayrak \u2014 who unlike his father-in-law speaks fluent English \u2014 also took primary control over relations with Washington. Among his missions was to seek the extradition of Mr. Gulen, the religious leader blamed by Mr. Erdogan for orchestrating the July 2016 coup attempt. In September of that year, Mr. Albayrak met with Mr. Flynn in New York to discuss a campaign to seek Mr. Gulen\u2019s extradition to Turkey. That effort led to criminal charges against two others in the meeting, Mr. Flynn and Mr. Alptekin. The Justice Department at the same time was investigating the second largest Turkish state bank, Halkbank, for a huge, multiyear effort to evade United States sanctions against Iran. Prosecutors said the bank transferred billions of dollars\u2019 worth of gold to Iran in exchange for oil and gas. Mr. Erdogan and Mr. Albayrak, according to information the United States investigators were then assembling, personally approved the sanctions-evasion scheme even after officials in the United States had arrested a Turkish-Iranian gold trader in the matter. (Turkish officials say their government had publicly dismissed the sanctions on Iran as American policy that was not binding on Turkey.) As the prosecution ramped up, Mr. Albayrak pressed Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to not impose new penalties on Halkbank. \u201cWe had a positive meeting with our U.S. counterpart,\u201d Mr. Albayrak told reporters in Turkey after a conversation with Mr. Mnuchin late last year. \u201cWe told them that Halkbank had not violated sanctions,\u201d he added. \u201cWe have positive expectations.\u201d Mr. Erdogan denounced the allegations against the bank as another \u201cpolitical coup attempt\u201d against him, and he urged Mr. Trump to shut down the investigation. For much of 2019, the bank negotiated with the Justice Department to avoid further charges, an effort that ended in October, amid the uproar over northern Syria, when the bank was indicted. The two presidential sons-in-law have known each other since at least 2018. As energy minister, Mr. Albayrak had promoted closer economic ties to Israel, and by 2018, he had visited the White House to talk with Mr. Kushner about his plans for Middle East peace. They met again in February in Ankara. Mr. Kushner was on his first official visit to discuss the Middle East with Mr. Erdogan and Mr. Albayrak. Afterward, Mr. Erdogan asked Mr. Kushner to hold a second meeting with Mr. Albayrak to discuss trade, according to a person involved. Mr. Kushner then set in motion an official five-day trip to Turkey this September by the commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, to promote expanded trade, this person said, even as lawmakers in Washington were calling for economic sanctions in response to Turkey\u2019s purchase of Russian weapons. A spokeswoman for Mr. Ross said early Tuesday that his efforts are now \u201con hold\u201d after the incursion into Syria. Mr. Erdogan hailed the February meeting of the sons-in-law as a potential turning point. When Mr. Trump nonetheless mused publicly about reducing certain trade benefits for Turkey over its purchase of a Russian missiles, Mr. Erdogan sounded puzzled. \u201cTrump sent his son-in-law to Turkey to talk about economic relations, I accepted the son-in-law, he sat down with our son-in-law and talked in detail,\u201d Mr. Erdogan said, suggesting that the timing of Mr. Trump\u2019s threat was \u201cthought provoking.\u201d By April, relations had grown strained again, in part over Turkey\u2019s purchase of the Russian missile defense systems. And Mr. Erdogan was increasingly frustrated with the American role in northern Syria, where a small American military force was protecting a Kurdish-led militia. Mr. Erdogan saw the militia as an extension of a Kurdish nationalist movement inside Turkey. He wanted the Turkish military to push them away from the border, and during a phone call with Mr. Erdogan in December 2018, Mr. Trump had abruptly agreed to pull out and let the Turks take over \u2014 only to reverse himself under pressure from the Pentagon. Against that backdrop, the three sons-in-law were set to attend a conference in April in Washington of the state-sponsored business group led by Mr. Yalcindag. Mr. Albayrak had been set to meet with Mr. Mnuchin, but Mr. Kushner arranged for all three to join Mr. Trump in the Oval Office. Pictures of the meeting bolstered Mr. Albayrak in Ankara politics, and he told Turkish journalists that Mr. Trump had shown an \u201cunderstanding perspective\u201d on the question of the Russian missiles. \u201cIt was a reflection of Mr. Trump\u2019s fondness, love and real warm feelings both toward Turkey and our president,\u201d Mr. Albayrak told CNN Turk about the Oval Office meeting. \u201cMr. Jared Kushner thankfully acted very closely and warmly,\u201d Mr. Albayrak said, and the two sons-in-law agreed to pursue \u201cbackdoor diplomacy, trying to carry forward the economic relationship of the two countries.\u201d Only two weeks earlier, Vice President Mike Pence had visited Ankara with a stern warning that accepting delivery of the Russian missiles could trigger a downgrade to Turkey\u2019s status within NATO. When the first Russian missiles arrived in Turkey in July, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee issued a bipartisan statement urging Mr. Trump \u201cto fully implement sanctions as required by law.\u201d Secretary of State Mike Pompeo expressed confidence that sanctions were coming. But a spokesman for Mr. Erdogan told the Turkish news media that after the Oval Office meeting with Mr. Albayrak, Mr. Trump had committed to using \u201cthe power that he has to intervene on that issue\u201d and to holding off on the sanctions. By late July, Mr. Trump appeared to deliver on that commitment. \u201cWe have a complicated situation,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters, repeating Mr. Erdogan\u2019s rationale that under the Obama administration Turkey \u201cwas not allowed\u201d to buy the American-made Patriots instead of the Russian version. \u201cThen, as soon as he buys something else, everybody says, \u2018O.K. You can buy it,\u2019\u201d Mr. Trump said, sympathetically. \u201cYou can\u2019t do business that way.\u201d To the public dismay of the many Republicans demanding sanctions, Mr. Trump instead asked the Senate Republicans for \u201cflexibility.\u201d He emphasized that the missiles were not yet operational and asked for time for more talks. (Mr. Trump canceled the planned sale of more than 100 F-35 fighter jets to Turkey, but the administration is holding continued discussions about letting Turkey back into the F-35 program.) Then, during a phone call on Oct. 6, Mr. Trump unexpectedly acceded once again to the wishes of the Turkish president by agreeing to remove American troops from northern Syria, making way for the Turkish incursion against the American-backed Kurdish-led forces. Faced with a domestic backlash, Mr. Trump threatened at one point to \u201cdestroy\u201d Turkey\u2019s economy, then announced but withdrew a new round of sanctions, and finally invited Mr. Erdogan to the White House. The Justice Department filed criminal charges for sanctions-busting against Halkbank. But the Treasury Department has not imposed penalties. And when Mr. Erdogan lands in Washington this week, his son-in-law will be with him. Mr. Yalcindag is there already. ",

      "author": "Shane Goldmacher",
      "content": " Michael R. Bloomberg still has not declared whether he is running for president in 2020. He is about to become the single biggest spender in the presidential race anyway. Ahead of a potential campaign announcement, Mr. Bloomberg, the billionaire businessman and former mayor of New York City, is beginning a $100 million digital campaign designed to attack and define President Trump in the top battleground states seen as likely to decide the 2020 election. The ads will go online on Friday in four states \u2014 Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u2014 and run through the end of the primary season, even if Mr. Bloomberg is not in the race. In a twist, Mr. Bloomberg himself will not be featured in the ads beyond legally required disclaimers, even as he actively lays the groundwork for a campaign, his advisers said. The $100 million ad buy will be in addition to whatever Mr. Bloomberg may spend on efforts to promote himself to become the Democratic nominee. \u201cWe will have other ads that feature Mike Bloomberg,\u201d said Howard Wolfson, a top political adviser to Mr. Bloomberg. \u201cYou will be seeing a lot of Mike Bloomberg.\u201d The Bloomberg team declined to preview the content of the ads ahead of their release, other than to say they would feature anti-Trump content. The spending is an unprecedented financial show of force and a pre-emptive strike to undercut the expected Democratic complaints that Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s money would be best spent on Democratic priorities, rather than his own presidential ambitions. It also delivers the unsubtle message that if Democrats were to nominate Mr. Bloomberg, his immense wealth could tilt the financial playing field of 2020 in their favor. \u201cWe\u2019re very clear: A case that we make for Mike is that he is the best candidate to take on Trump, and one of the reasons he is the best candidate is he can take the fight to him immediately and robustly,\u201d Mr. Wolfson said. Some Democrats have fretted for months that Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign was using its financial edge to swamp Democrats online, with Mr. Trump spending more than $27 million so far just on Facebook and Google. Earlier this fall, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign announced it had entered October with $158 million cash on hand in its campaign and shared accounts with the Republican National Committee. And in the 24 hours after the first congressional impeachment hearing this week, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign said it had raised $3.1 million in small donations. \u201cIf you believe, as Mike Bloomberg does, that Donald Trump represents an existential threat to our country, it is an all-hands-on-deck moment,\u201d Mr. Wolfson said. \u201cThe thinking is that the general election has started.\u201d The list of swing states included in Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s anti-Trump campaign would most likely grow in the future, Mr. Wolfson said. Mr. Bloomberg also spent heavily in the 2018 midterms, pouring about $100 million into Democratic efforts, particularly to win control of Congress. Democrats won 21 of the 24 House races  he invested in. The new anti-Trump campaign by Mr. Bloomberg is the second major infusion of Democratic money into online advertising in two weeks. A new progressive organization, Acronym, announced earlier in November that it and an affiliated PAC were investing $75 million in online ads in battleground states. That group, advised by David Plouffe, who managed Barack Obama\u2019s first presidential campaign, was focused on the same four states as Mr. Bloomberg, plus North Carolina. Mr. Plouffe said Acronym\u2019s goal was to ensure that whoever emerged as the party\u2019s nominee was not in a \u201chole too steep to dig out of.\u201d In addition, Priorities USA, the leading Democratic super PAC in the 2016 race, has said it plans to spent $100 million, including on digital ads, its analytics program and on television, through the convention. The group held a briefing this week on its anti-Trump program and said that, since late July, its PAC had actually outspent Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign in the four battlegrounds where it was advertising: Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The group noted that much of Mr. Trump\u2019s spending had been targeting new donors versus trying to persuade swing voters. Priorities USA also announced that it would expand to Arizona, one of the states that Mr. Bloomberg is targeting, with a $2 million digital buy. Mr. Bloomberg has flirted with running for president before \u2014 including as an independent in 2016 \u2014 but he has taken concrete steps toward a Democratic primary campaign in recent days, including submitting paperwork to appear on the ballot in Alabama and Arkansas, the states with the earliest filing deadlines. The disclaimer on Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s personal website was recently changed to \u201cPaid for by Mike Bloomberg 2020,\u201d which campaign finance experts said suggested a formal filing could be imminent. Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s advisers have said that if he runs, he will focus on the delegate-rich states that vote on Super Tuesday in March, such as California and Texas, where the cost for most other campaigns to buy substantial advertising would be prohibitive. The filing deadline for New Hampshire, which holds the first primary contest after Iowa\u2019s caucuses, is Friday, but Mr. Bloomberg is not expected to file to be on the ballot there, his team said. If he does run, Mr. Bloomberg would be the second billionaire to enter the Democratic field, following Tom Steyer, a former hedge fund manager. Mr. Steyer has said he would spend $100 million of his fortune on a campaign, and he had already spent nearly $50 million as of the end of September. Mr. Steyer\u2019s heavy advertising in the early states has delivered him enough support in polls to qualify for the November debate, which will take place next week. But such free spending from billionaires has threatened a potential backlash among the progressive base. \u201cCall me radical, but maybe instead of setting ablaze hundreds of millions of dollars on multiple plutocratic, long-shot, very-late presidential bids, we instead invest hundreds of millions into winning majorities of state legislatures across the United States?\u201d Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, who has endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, wrote on Twitter on Thursday. \u201cJust a thought!\u201d",

Stone Jr., accused of lying about his contacts with WikiLeaks during the 2016 campaign.By Sharon LaFraniere and Zach MontaguePRINT EDITIONAide Testifies Trump Predicted More Leaks in 2016|November 13, 2019, Page A15",
      "author": "Sharon LaFraniere",
      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 Days after the rogue website WikiLeaks posted a trove of stolen Democratic Party emails during the 2016 presidential campaign, Donald J. Trump talked by phone with Roger J. Stone Jr., a longtime friend who claimed to have connections to WikiLeaks, then told a top aide that \u201cmore information would be coming,\u201d the aide testified in Mr. Stone\u2019s criminal trial on Tuesday. The aide, Rick Gates, said he did not hear the substance of the July 31, 2016, call. Nor did he say that Mr. Trump mentioned WikiLeaks, the organization that had received tens of thousands of emails stolen by Russian operatives seeking to sabotage the campaign of his opponent, Hillary Clinton. But the context of the exchange suggests that Mr. Stone briefed Mr. Trump on whatever he had picked up about the website\u2019s plans. In written answers that President Trump supplied during the special counsel\u2019s investigation of Russian influence in the campaign, he said he did not recall the specifics of any of his 21 phone calls with Mr. Stone in the six months before the election. He also said he did not recall knowing that his campaign advisers were in touch with Mr. Stone about WikiLeaks. Mr. Gates\u2019s testimony revealed other new details about the Trump campaign\u2019s intense interest in how WikiLeaks might disrupt Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign. Much of what he said in court was covered in the 448-page report by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, but it was blacked out in the version released publicly last spring to protect grand jury secrecy or open cases, a person familiar with the report said. In conversations with the Trump campaign as early as April 2016, Mr. Gates said, Mr. Stone had predicted releases of Democratic documents that would prove helpful to Mr. Trump. That was roughly three months before WikiLeaks released its first tranche of stolen emails, throwing the Clinton campaign on the defensive on the eve of the Democratic National Convention. \u201cIt was, in a way, a gift,\u201d Mr. Gates testified about the July 22 release of tens of thousands of emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee. He said the Trump campaign was \u201cin a state of happiness\u201d that Mr. Stone\u2019s predictions had come true. Mr. Stone, a former Trump campaign aide and 40-year friend of the president\u2019s, repeatedly told top campaign officials that he was privy to inside information from WikiLeaks through his connections with Julian Assange, the organization\u2019s founder. He now says that he was only boasting and had access to only public sources of information. Phone records introduced into evidence in Mr. Stone\u2019s trial suggest that he kept in close touch with Mr. Trump and his top campaign aides. From March to November 2016, the records show, Mr. Stone had 39 calls with Mr. Trump, 126 calls with Mr. Gates and 153 calls with Paul Manafort, who was forced to resign as campaign chairman that August but continued to informally advise the campaign. In the final three months of the race, Mr. Stone tried to dispatch two intermediaries to get either stolen emails or information from Mr. Assange. Both of them have testified under oath that they were unsuccessful. After its July 22 release, WikiLeaks went dark for months. Then, at a critical moment, it released thousands of emails stolen from the account of John D. Podesta, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman. That release distracted attention from an explosive audio tape in which Mr. Trump was heard bragging about grabbing women\u2019s genitals. Mr. Stone is on trial for lying to the House Intelligence Committee in September 2017 about his efforts to contact WikiLeaks and with trying to block the testimony of another witness whose account would have contradicted his. At the time, the committee was conducting a parallel inquiry to Mr. Mueller\u2019s into Russian interference in the election, including the role of WikiLeaks. Prosecutors claim that Mr. Stone lied because the truth about his efforts to reach WikiLeaks would have embarrassed Mr. Trump and his campaign. They rested their case on Tuesday after presenting four days of evidence. Defense lawyers have argued that Mr. Stone never deliberately misled congressional investigators, but simply confined his answers to what he believed were the strict parameters of the committee\u2019s inquiry. They played a 50-minute-long recording of Mr. Stone\u2019s testimony to the House committee, then rested their case, as well. Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who is overseeing the trial in Washington, said she expected the case to go to the jury by Wednesday, far sooner than had been expected. The charges against Mr. Stone, 67, carry a maximum penalty of 20 years, although the punishment for a defendant with no criminal record, like Mr. Stone, would almost certainly be far lighter. Mr. Gates, who served as Mr. Trump\u2019s deputy campaign chairman, has been a prominent witness in a series of criminal prosecutions by Mr. Mueller\u2019s team against Mr. Trump\u2019s former aides. After pleading guilty to conspiracy and lying to federal investigators in early 2018, he testified about financial crimes he committed with Mr. Manafort, who was convicted and is now serving a seven-and-a-half-year prison term. Mr. Gates, who may be sentenced next month, is hoping that his cooperation with federal prosecutors will spare him a prison term, leaving him instead on probation. Over all, he said, federal investigators or prosecutors have interviewed him about 40 or 50 times.",

      "author": "Annie Karni",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Former Gov. Mark Sanford of South Carolina said on Tuesday that he was ending his long-shot primary challenge to President Trump just two months after announcing it, arguing that the impeachment inquiry had made it impossible for his message of fiscal conservatism to break through. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be a realist and what I did not anticipate is an impeachment,\u201d Mr. Sanford said at a news conference in Concord, N.H., where he announced the end of his campaign. Mr. Sanford conceded that his bid had been \u201ca long shot, but we wanted to try and interject this issue, how much we\u2019re spending, into the national debate, which comes along once every four years.\u201d He said he found no \u201cappetite for a serious nuanced debate with impeachment in the air.\u201d During his short-lived, quixotic campaign, Mr. Sanford made it clear he did not support the impeachment inquiry unfolding on Capitol Hill. And unlike the other two Republican primary challengers in the race, Mr. Sanford never mounted an argument based on Mr. Trump\u2019s fitness for office, saying instead that he would support Mr. Trump in a general election if he became the party\u2019s nominee. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to run against Trump without being able to criticize this abuse of power, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a clear case for your candidacy,\u201d said Sarah Longwell, a Republican strategist who has been working to resist Mr. Trump from within the party. \u201cHe always tried to make it about an issue. A single-issue candidacy around the debt in this era can\u2019t find much oxygen.\u201d Mr. Sanford was one of three Republican primary challengers attempting to peel off support from a president whose approval ratings in his own party rank consistently in the high 80s. He was joined in the David-vs.-Goliath struggle by Joe Walsh, a former Tea Party-backed congressman from Illinois, and William F. Weld, a former Massachusetts governor. Both are still running. The \u201cthree stooges,\u201d as Mr. Trump branded them on Twitter, saw themselves more as the Three Musketeers, who together hoped to create a chorus of Republican voices opposing Mr. Trump from different viewpoints. A longtime foil for Mr. Trump, Mr. Sanford, who served two separate stints in the House of Representatives in addition to serving as governor, was seen in some respects as the most viable of the trio, as the one who might have had the most success in getting under Mr. Trump\u2019s skin and hectoring him from the right on the issue of the federal debt. A onetime A-list Republican with a strong conservative anti-spending message, Mr. Sanford\u2019s political career almost ended for good in 2009, when he acknowledged an extramarital affair with a woman whom he secretly visited in Argentina while his aides claimed he was hiking the Appalachian Trail. He was censured but served out the rest of his term as governor, stepping down in 2011. Mr. Sanford came back for another political act, however, winning re-election to the House in 2013. He was elected twice more but lost a Republican primary in 2018 to a candidate backed by Mr. Trump, Katie Arrington. Ms. Arrington was ultimately defeated by a Democrat. Of the three Republican primary challengers, Mr. Sanford in the end had the hardest time differentiating himself from Mr. Trump after he said he did not support impeachment. \u201cI respect Mark,\u201d said William Kristol, the conservative writer and former editor of the now defunct magazine The Weekly Standard. \u201cHe at least tried to step up, when so many other Republicans haven\u2019t done anything.\u201d Mr. Kristol, who has been a prominent \u201cNever Trump\u201d Republican since Mr. Trump was elected in 2016, has been working hard over the past year to recruit candidates to run against him. The Trump campaign dismissed Mr. Sanford\u2019s exit from the stage in the same way it had dismissed him while he was running. \u201cHis candidacy had escaped our attention,\u201d said Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for the Trump campaign. In reality, however, the campaign had been systematically working to ensure the trio of challengers had no way to break through. The Republican Parties in Arizona, Kansas, Nevada and South Carolina, meanwhile, canceled the 2020 presidential primaries in their states, making it virtually impossible for Mr. Trump\u2019s challengers to build support. And the campaign has also changed the rules in 37 states and territories for choosing delegates to the Republican National Convention, an effort to ensure there are no dissenting voices at the party gathering in Charlotte next year.",

      "author": "Sheryl Gay Stolberg",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 As the senior State Department official in charge of Ukraine, George P. Kent was so alarmed by what he viewed as President Trump\u2019s efforts to initiate \u201cpolitically motivated prosecutions\u201d there that he wrote a memo about it over the summer \u2014 weeks before an anonymous whistle-blower\u2019s explosive complaint prompted the impeachment inquiry. On Wednesday, he became one of the first public witnesses in the investigation. In his closed-door interview with the House Intelligence Committee last month, Mr. Kent suggested the president was engaged in behavior the United States would never tolerate in nations with corrupt governments. \u201cThere is an outstanding issue about people in office in those countries using selectively politically motivated prosecutions to go after their opponents,\u201d Mr. Kent said, according to a transcript released last week. \u201cAnd that\u2019s wrong for the rule of law regardless of what country that happens.\u201d A Harvard graduate and career diplomat who speaks Ukrainian, Russian and Thai, Mr. Kent joined the State Department in 1992 and now holds the title of deputy assistant secretary for European and Eurasian Affairs. He has a deep knowledge of corruption in Ukraine from his time as an anticorruption coordinator in the State Department\u2019s European Bureau in 2014 and 2015, and later as deputy chief of mission in the United States Embassy in Kiev from 2015 until 2018. Mr. Kent is known for pushing for good governance causes without regard for whom he might offend. He once told former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s staff that it \u201ccould create the perception of a conflict of interest\u201d that Mr. Biden\u2019s son was serving on the board of a Ukrainian gas company that had been accused of corruption. He also accused a Ukrainian prosecutor of taking a bribe to drop a case against the oligarch who owned that gas company. And he fought vigorously to defend Marie L. Yovanovitch, the former ambassador to Ukraine who was ousted by Mr. Trump, calling a different Ukrainian prosecutor\u2019s criticism of her \u201ccomplete poppycock\u201d in an email to other State Department officials. On the day of his deposition, Mr. Kent strode into the Capitol wearing a bow-tie and dark three-piece suit, and spent more than seven hours with investigators. He made clear that he was deeply troubled by the way Mr. Trump and his allies were pushing Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, and complained that Mr. Trump\u2019s inner circle had sidelined him. He was all but cut out of decisions regarding Ukraine, he told investigators, after a May meeting organized by Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff. Mr. Kent was especially disturbed at the role of Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, whom he viewed as running a rogue foreign policy operation in Ukraine that excluded career diplomats. He had warned colleagues as far back as March about what he described as \u201cdisinformation\u201d being spread by Mr. Giuliani and Trump allies in the conservative news media to smear both Mr. Biden and Ms. Yovanovitch. Mr. Giuliani, he told investigators, was running \u201ca campaign of lies.\u201d In his private testimony, he offered new detail that appeared to underscore the idea that Mr. Trump\u2019s actions were politically motivated, saying he was told that the president wanted to hear President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine say the name \u201cClinton\u201d in connection with potential wrongdoing. Using the acronym for president of the United States, he told investigators, \u201cPOTUS wanted nothing less than President Zelensky to go to microphone and say, investigations, Biden and Clinton.\u201d",

      "content": " Jennifer Williams, the special adviser on Europe and Russia for Vice President Mike Pence, appeared in front of the House Intelligence Committee on the third day of public impeachment hearings. Ms. Williams, who listened in on the July 25 phone call between President Trump and Ukraine\u2019s leader, described the call as \u201cunusual\u201d because \u201cit involved discussion of what appeared to be a domestic political matter.\u201d The following is Ms. Williams\u2019s opening statement, as prepared for delivery and released by the House Intelligence Committee on Tuesday. Thank you, Chairman Schiff, Ranking Member Nunes, and other Members of the Committee for the opportunity to provide this statement. I appear today pursuant to a subpoena and am prepared to answer your questions to the best of my abilities. I have had the privilege of serving as a Foreign Service Officer for nearly fourteen years, working for three different presidential administrations \u2014 two Republican and one Democratic. I joined the State Department in 2006 after serving in the Department of Homeland Security under Secretary Michael Chertoff. It was with great pride and conviction that I swore an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution, administered by a personal hero of mine, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. As a career officer, I am committed to serving the American people and advancing American interests abroad, in support of the President\u2019s foreign policy objectives. I have been inspired and encouraged in that journey by the thousands of other dedicated public servants whom I am proud to call colleagues across the Foreign Service, civil service, military, and federal law enforcement agencies. I have served overseas tours in Kingston, Jamaica; Beirut, Lebanon; and London, United Kingdom. I have worked to implement humanitarian assistance programs to millions of victims of the Syria conflict, and served as an adviser on Middle East issues to the Deputy Secretary of State. And this spring, it was the greatest honor of my career to be asked to serve as a Special Advisor to the Vice President for Europe and Russia. Over the past eight months, I have been privileged to work with the dedicated and capable men and women in the Office of the Vice President to advance the Administration\u2019s agenda. I have also worked closely with talented and committed colleagues at the National Security Council (\u201cNSC\u201d), State Department, Department of Defense, and other agencies to advance and promote U.S. foreign policy objectives. In this capacity, I have advised and prepared the Vice President for engagements related to Ukraine. As you are aware, on November 7th, I appeared before the Committee for a closed-door deposition pursuant to a subpoena. I would like to take this opportunity to briefly summarize my recollection of some of the events I expect the Committee may ask me about. President Zelensky\u2019s Inauguration On April 21st, Volodymyr Zelensky won the Ukrainian presidential election. On April 23rd, the Vice President called to congratulate President-elect Zelensky. During the call, which I participated in, the Vice President accepted an invitation to attend President-elect Zelensky\u2019s upcoming inauguration, provided that the scheduling worked out. The Vice President had only a narrow window of availability at the end of May, and the Ukrainian parliament would not meet to set a date for the inauguration until after May 14th. As a result, we did not expect to know whether the Vice President could attend until May 14th at the earliest, and we made only preliminary trip preparations in early May. On May 13th, an assistant to the Vice President\u2019s Chief of Staff called and informed me that President Trump had decided that the Vice President would not attend the inauguration in Ukraine. She did not provide any further explanation. I relayed that instruction to others involved in planning the potential trip. I also informed the NSC that the Vice President would not be attending, so that it could identify a head of delegation to represent the United States at President-elect Zelensky\u2019s inauguration. Hold on Ukraine Security Assistance On July 3rd, I learned that the Office of Management and Budget (\u201cOMB\u201d) had placed a hold on a tranche of security assistance designated for Ukraine. According to the information I received, OMB was reviewing whether the funding was aligned with the Administration\u2019s priorities. I subsequently attended meetings of the Policy Coordination Committee where the hold on Ukrainian security assistance was discussed. During those meetings, representatives of the State and Defense Departments advocated that the hold should be lifted, and OMB representatives reported that the White House Chief of Staff had directed that the hold should remain in place. On September 11th, I learned that the hold on security assistance for Ukraine had been released. I have never learned what prompted that decision. July 25th Call Between President Trump and President Zelensky On July 25th, along with several of my colleagues, I listened to a call between President Trump and President Zelensky \u2014 the content of which has since been publicly reported. Prior to July 25th, I had participated in roughly a dozen other presidential phone calls. During my closed-door deposition, Members of the Committee asked about my personal views and whether I had any concerns about the July 25th call. As I testified then, I found the July 25th phone call unusual because, in contrast to other presidential calls I had observed, it involved discussion of what appeared to be a domestic political matter. After the July 25th call, I provided an update in the Vice President\u2019s daily briefing book indicating that President Trump had a call that day with President Zelensky. A hard copy of the memorandum transcribing the call was also included in the book. I do not know whether the Vice President reviewed my update or the transcript. I did not discuss the July 25th call with the Vice President or any of my colleagues in the Office of the Vice President or the NSC. September 1 Meeting Between the Vice President and President Zelensky On August 29th, I learned that the Vice President would be traveling to Poland to meet with President Zelensky on September 1st. At the September 1st meeting, which I attended, President Zelensky asked the Vice President about news articles reporting a hold on U.S. security assistance for Ukraine. The Vice President responded that Ukraine had the United States\u2019 unwavering support and promised to relay their conversation to President Trump that night. During the September 1st meeting, neither the Vice President nor President Zelensky mentioned the specific investigations discussed during the July 25th call. *** Thank you again for the opportunity to provide this statement. I would be happy to answer any questions.",

Their stories are compellingly human, uniquely American, often immigrant. \u201cI am an American by choice, having become a citizen in 2002,\u201d Fiona Hill, the former top Europe and Russia expert at the White House, and one of three immigrants among the 10, told the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday. \u201cI was born in the northeast of England, in the same region that George Washington\u2019s ancestors came from.\u201d As with other witnesses, she was eager to frame her service to the United States in terms of her immigrant experience. \u201cI can say with confidence that this country has offered me opportunities I never would have had in England,\u201d said Ms. Hill, the descendant of coal miners. \u201cI grew up poor, with a very distinctive working-class accent. In England in the 1980s and 1990s, this would have impeded my professional advancement.\u201d A similar note of first-generation gratitude came from Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman, the National Security Council\u2019s Ukraine expert who testified Tuesday. He said he never could have spoken up about his concerns \u2014 that a phone call between Mr. Trump and the president of Ukraine was inappropriate \u2014 had his father not fled the Soviet Union four decades ago. On the contrary, he offered that as a reason he felt compelled to appear. \u201cIn Russia, my act of expressing concern to the chain of command in an official and private channel would have severe personal and professional repercussions,\u201d Colonel Vindman said. \u201cOffering public testimony involving the president would surely cost me my life.\u201d The theme carried unmistakable subtexts. Marie L. Yovanovitch, the former ambassador to Ukraine, spoke of how undermined she felt when she learned of a smear campaign against her, ostensibly because she was viewed as unhelpful to Mr. Trump \u2014 \u201cbad news\u201d in his words. \u201cWhat U.S. ambassador could be blamed for harboring the fear that they can\u2019t count on our government to support them,\u201d Ms. Yovanovitch said last week, in an opening statement that also included a chronicle of how her father fled the Soviets and how her mother grew up \u201cstateless\u201d in Nazi Germany. \u201cTheir personal histories, my personal history, gave me both deep gratitude toward the United States and great empathy for others like the Ukrainian people who want to be free.\u201d The Republicans were not always impressed. Representative Devin Nunes of California, the ranking Republican on the Intelligence Committee, made repeated references to the witnesses \u201cauditioning\u201d for the right to play in \u201cthe Democrat\u2019s star chamber.\u201d But an essential part of the witnesses\u2019 refrain was that they have served multiple presidents of both parties. Anodyne in some ways, the point makes a statement central to the identity of so many civil servants who populate every administration. \u201cI take great pride in the fact that I am a nonpartisan foreign policy expert, who has served under three different Republican and Democratic presidents,\u201d Ms. Hill told the committee. Laura K. Cooper, a career Pentagon official, said on Wednesday, \u201cI have proudly served two Democratic and two Republican presidents.\u201d William B. Taylor Jr., the top American diplomat in Ukraine, let people know where he stood last week exactly three paragraphs into his opening statement. \u201cI am nonpartisan and have been appointed to my positions by every president from President Reagan to President Trump,\u201d he said. An uglier subtext questioned their patriotism. Colonel Vindman, who was born in Ukraine and came to the United States when he was 3, faced doubts about what nation he was actually committed to serving. In that hearing, Steve Castor, the counsel for the panel\u2019s Republicans, pressed him about whether he considered accepting a job offer as the defense minister of his birth country. Colonel Vindman said it would have been a great honor but quickly shot down the prospect. \u201cI am an American,\u201d he said. \u201cI came here when I was a toddler and I immediately dismissed these offers.\u201d Although none of the witnesses were angling for cable news gigs, by the close of the last hearing on Thursday, they had become unwilling symbols of the Washington \u201cestablishment\u201d \u2014 tarred as embedded resistors by a president who is just trying to \u201cshake things up.\u201d In a sense, they have also become proxies inside a larger battle at the heart of the impeachment debate. Molly Montgomery, a former Foreign Service officer who did not testify, said the hearings revealed a \u201chuge gap between the reality that is experienced by public servants on the ground and the rhetoric in the political world.\u201d Ms. Montgomery, whose last position was as special adviser for Europe and Eurasia to Vice President Mike Pence, said she was heartened to see so many \u201ceveryday Americans\u201d on social media express their appreciation, even awe, over so much of the testimony in recent days. \u201cThe one silver lining here,\u201d she said, \u201cis that the American people are getting to see firsthand that there are Americans who serve all over the world, under difficult circumstances. And that they are just as patriotic and just as admirable as anyone who wears a uniform.\u201d Despite the aversion of the witnesses to anything that might suggest grandstanding or partisanship, it did not preclude some of them from expressing points of view. Ms. Hill was adamant Thursday that she would not take part in any \u201calternative narrative\u201d promoted by Mr. Trump and some Republican allies on the committee that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered in the 2016 presidential election. \u201cThese fictions are harmful even if they are deployed for purely domestic political purposes,\u201d Ms. Hill said of these notions. She issued a broader plea. \u201cWhen we are consumed by partisan rancor,\u201d she said, \u201cwe cannot combat these external forces as they seek to divide us against each other.\u201d",

      "author": "Jonathan Martin",
      "content": " A Democratic group unveiled a $3 million advertising campaign Tuesday featuring people who supported President Trump but now regret it, the first wave of a yearlong effort to reclaim some of the voters in the industrial Midwest who helped tip the 2016 election. The group, American Bridge, will air commercials in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania that are first-person testimonials from residents of each state explaining why they backed Mr. Trump in 2016 and why they will not do so again next year. While it\u2019s not uncommon to spotlight voters in political advertising, these commercials feature no narration and are set, documentary-style, in the homes and towns of those on camera. \u201cWe want to create a permission structure in these communities,\u201d said Bradley Beychok, the president of American Bridge. \u201cWe want them to know, \u2018It wasn\u2019t just me.\u2019 But you have to create space for people to defect.\u201d The voters featured in the commercials all focus on Mr. Trump\u2019s record, and what they say is his self-focus and lack of accomplishments in their communities, while avoiding issues that often consume Washington, like impeachment or Mr. Trump\u2019s inflammatory language. Speaking in personal terms, they acknowledge that they supported the president because they thought that, as a political outsider, he would be a more effective change agent than the elected officials who won the White House every four years, until him. One participant, Lori Malburg from Romeo, Mich., was blunt about her feelings of regret. \u201cI\u2019m kind of embarrassed to admit that I voted for Donald Trump at this point,\u201d Ms. Malburg says in the spot that features her and her hometown, which is part of a storied swing county, Macomb, that flipped from Democrat to Republican three years ago. The advertising campaign, which will include broadcast television, radio and online spots, comes at a moment when many Democrats have been expressing alarm that Mr. Trump\u2019s heavy campaign spending on digital ads has been all but uncontested. But now, as the Democratic presidential primary appears as uncertain as ever, a handful of liberal groups are working to match the president\u2019s re-election efforts. American Bridge plans to eventually spend about $50 million in the coming year as part of this effort and hopes to feature new, local voices in each wave of ads. While the initial focus will be on Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania \u2014 each of which supported Mr. Trump by less than a single point \u2014 the group may add Florida to the lineup next year. \u201cWhat we got wrong in 2016 is that we spent all our time compiling Trump\u2019s record, saying look at how gross and despicable this man is, but we never turned the mirror around on the voters,\u201d said Mr. Beychok. \u201cSo this is going to be about daily economic life in these communities \u2014 not impeachment, Ukraine or his tweets.\u201d The commercials are plainly aimed at the white working-class voters who supported former President Barack Obama\u2019s campaigns but shifted to Mr. Trump in 2016. It\u2019s a constituency that is increasingly aligned with Republicans, leading some Democrats to question whether it\u2019s worth the effort needed to win them back. But officials at American Bridge say they need to make only modest inroads with these voters to take back the Midwestern states they lost. \u201cWe don\u2019t necessarily think we can flip back all the Obama-to-Trump counties, but we do feel we can drive his margin down in them,\u201d said David Brock, the group's chairman and co-founder. Originally known as an opposition research firm, American Bridge is seeking to expand its footprint at a moment when Democrats are out of power in the White House and there is no clear party leader. The group has brought on a host of prominent Democrats, including former Gov. Jennifer Granholm of Michigan and Jim Messina, who ran Mr. Obama\u2019s 2012 re-election. \u201cWhile our candidates are fighting for the Democratic nomination, we cannot let Trump have a clear runway to the general election,\u201d said Mr. Messina. \u201cIn 2012, we put Mitt Romney on the defensive from the beginning and he was never able to recover. With an arguably smaller map this cycle, we have to compete for every vote, and this early effort will be a critical component of success in November 2020.\u201d Part of the group\u2019s challenge in such a polarized moment, however, will be finding people in their communities willing to appear on television speaking in personal terms about politics. Mr. Beychok said the group was using paid canvassers to find people willing to express their views and monitoring national and local media sources, including letters to the editor pages, for signs of discontent with Mr. Trump. (The disaffected Trump voter who appeared in the Pennsylvania spot \u2014 Mark Graham of Erie, Pa. \u2014 was featured in a New York Times article last month.) He said the group may alter its message to correspond with the moment \u2014 spotlighting taxes during tax season or tariffs during harvest, for example \u2014 but that one element would remain the same. \u201cIt has to be local, local, local,\u201d said Mr. Beychok.",

      "author": "Peter Baker",
      "content": " Marie L. Yovanovitch recounted in powerful and personal terms on Friday the devastation and fear she felt as she was targeted first by President Trump\u2019s allies and later by the president himself, saying she felt threatened. Removed from her post as ambassador to Ukraine, Ms. Yovanovitch said she was bereft when she came under fire from the president\u2019s personal attorney and eldest son last spring, but was even more stunned in September when she learned that Mr. Trump himself had disparaged her in his now-famous July 25 phone call with Ukraine\u2019s president. \u201cIt was a terrible moment,\u201d she told the House Intelligence Committee on the second day of public impeachment hearings. \u201cA person who saw me actually reading the transcript said that the color drained from my face. I think I even had a physical reaction. I think, you know, even now, words kind of fail me.\u201d In the July call, according to a rough transcript released by the White House, Mr. Trump called Ms. Yovanovitch \u201cbad news\u201d and said that \u201cshe\u2019s going to go through some things.\u201d Asked her reaction when she read that, Ms. Yovanovitch said: \u201cShocked. Appalled. Devastated that the president of the United States would talk about any ambassador like that to a foreign head of state \u2014 and it was me. I mean, I couldn\u2019t believe it.\" Asked what the words  \u201cgoing to go through some things\u201d sounded like to her, she said, \u201cIt sounded like a threat.\u201d At the very moment she was testifying about how Mr. Trump had denigrated her, the president was assailing Ms. Yovanovitch, insulting her diplomatic career and reasserting his right to remove her, prompting Democrats to suggest he was trying to intimidate a witness. \u201cEverywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cShe started off in Somalia, how did that go? Then fast forward to Ukraine, where the new Ukrainian President spoke unfavorably about her in my second phone call with him. It is a U.S. President\u2019s absolute right to appoint ambassadors.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet omitted the context in which he discussed Ms. Yovanovitch with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine during their July 25 phone conversation, which actually came two months after she had been recalled from Ukraine. It was Mr. Trump who first criticized Ms. Yovanovitch, calling her \u201cbad news.\u201d Mr. Zelensky responded that he completely agreed with Mr. Trump and pointed out \u201cyou were the first one who told me that she was a bad ambassador.\u201d Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, interrupted the hearing to read Ms. Yovanovitch the tweet and ask her what she thought of it. Ms. Yovanovitch, a tight smile on her face, appeared momentarily uncertain how to respond. \u201cIt\u2019s very intimidating,\u201d she said. She then paused, searching for words. \u201cI can\u2019t speak to what the president is trying to do, but the effect is to be intimidating.\u201d Mr. Schiff responded in a stern tone that, \u201cSome of us here take witness intimidation very, very seriously.\u201d Representative Jim Himes, Democrat of Connecticut and a member of the Intelligence panel, said it was an instance of \u201cclear witness tampering\u201d that could form the basis of an article of impeachment against Mr. Trump. While Ms. Yovanovitch was removed from her post in Ukraine, she remains a State Department employee working in the government headed by Mr. Trump. At an unrelated event later in the day, Mr. Trump denied trying to intimidate Ms. Yovanovitch. \u201cI want freedom of speech,\u201d he told reporters, and lashed out at Democrats for conducting what he called an unfair impeachment process. Mr. Trump said he watched \u201ca little bit\u201d of the hearing and said \u201cit\u2019s really sad when you see people not allowed to ask questions,\u201d referring to some squabbling between Mr. Schiff and Republican members about when they would get to ask their questions. \u201cNobody has such horrible due process,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s considered a joke all over Washington and all over the world.\u201d In the end, each of the Republicans was granted the same amount of time to ask questions as each Democrat. As they opened their own questioning,  Republicans on the committee and the party\u2019s lead lawyer took a strikingly different approach to Ms. Yovanovitch than Mr. Trump, avoiding any personal attacks and instead stressing that she was removed before the main events under scrutiny took place. Representative Devin Nunes of California, the lead Republican on the panel, and Steve Castor, the committee\u2019s Republican counsel, made no effort to undercut the former ambassador\u2019s credibility but instead emphasized that her experience, whether justified or not, had no real bearing on whether the president had committed high crimes and misdemeanors. Mr. Nunes characterized her removal as an \u201cemployment disagreement\u201d and said she was \u201cnot a material fact witness to any of the allegations that are being hurled at the president.\u201d He led her through a series of quick questions meant to demonstrate that she had left Ukraine before the suspension of American aid and before the July 25 phone call when Mr. Trump asked Mr. Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and other Democrats. \u201cI\u2019m not exactly sure what the ambassador is doing here today,\u201d Mr. Nunes said. Several of the Republicans led Ms. Yovanovitch through a series of questions that produced largely dry, fireworks-free exchanges intended to help the president, making the points that her removal did not change American policy, that her career was not permanently damaged and that the president had well-founded reasons to be concerned about corruption in Ukraine. But while the president suggested in his tweet on Friday that Ms. Yovanovitch was a bad diplomat, the House Republicans largely offered the opposite assessment. \u201cWe are lucky to have you in Foreign Service,\u201d said Representative Elise Stefanik, Republican of New York. While lawmakers pondered impeaching Mr. Trump, a jury in a courthouse only a few hundred yards away found the president\u2019s longtime friend Roger J. Stone Jr. guilty of lying to the very same House Intelligence Committee. Mr. Stone was convicted of obstructing a congressional investigation into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election in what prosecutors said was an effort to protect Mr. Trump. He was found guilty of lying to the House committee, trying to block the testimony of another potential witness, and concealing reams of evidence from investigators. Prosecutors claimed he tried to thwart the committee\u2019s work because the truth would have \u201clooked terrible\u201d for both the president and his campaign. In all, he faced seven felony charges and was found guilty on all counts. Mr. Trump, having a bad day, vented frustration that his friend was convicted while his enemies have not been. Among those enemies he named: Mr. Schiff, the chairman of the House committee. If generally reluctant to assail Ms. Yovanovitch, Republicans had no such hesitance about going after Hunter Biden, the son of the former vice president, in hopes of turning attention to what they portrayed as Democratic conflicts in Ukraine. Republican lawmakers got Ms. Yovanovitch to say that when she was first nominated for her ambassador post by President Barack Obama, she was prepared for questions about Hunter Biden that might come up during her confirmation hearings. The younger Mr. Biden was on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company, at the same time his father was managing policy toward Ukraine. Ms. Yovanovitch testified that if questions came up about the situation, she was instructed to refer questions to the vice president\u2019s office. Asked by Republicans why it would be a problem, she said, \u201cIt creates a concern that there would be an appearance of conflict of interest.\u201d Ms. Yovanovitch suggested that \u201cthe smear campaign against me\u201d by Mr. Trump allies was orchestrated in tandem with corrupt Ukrainians leading to her removal from her post based on untrue allegations. Ms. Yovanovitch flatly denied the \u201cbaseless allegations\u201d raised against her by Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal attorney, and others working with him. She called them part of a \u201ccampaign of disinformation\u201d that was orchestrated with Ukrainians because she was a powerful advocate of fighting corruption. \u201cMr. Giuliani should have known those claims were suspect, coming as they reportedly did from individuals with questionable motives and with reason to believe that their political and financial ambitions would be stymied by our anti-corruption policy in Ukraine,\u201d she told the House Intelligence Committee as it opened its second day of public impeachment hearings. She added: \u201cIf our chief representative is kneecapped, it limits our effectiveness to safeguard the vital national security interests of the United States.\u201d Ms. Yovanovitch went on to say that the State Department\u2019s failure to defend her and others subjected to partisan attacks had a profoundly negative impact on the institution as a whole. \u201cThis is about far, far more than me or a couple of individuals,\u201d she said. \u201cAs Foreign Service professionals are being denigrated and undermined, the institution is also being degraded. This will soon cause real harm, if it hasn\u2019t already.\u201d As the hearing was about to be gaveled to a start on Friday morning, the White House released a rough transcript of another phone call that Mr. Trump had with Ukraine\u2019s president in an effort to demonstrate that there was nothing untoward in that conversation. Mr. Nunes  read the record of the conversation out loud as part of his opening statement in sort of a dramatic re-enactment of the conversation. The record documented an April 21 call that Mr. Trump made from Air Force One to Mr. Zelensky congratulating him on his election. That call came three months before the July 25 call in which the president asked Mr. Zelensky to do him \u201ca favor\u201d and investigate Democrats including Mr. Biden. The record of the original call reflected just a few minutes of pleasantries. \u201cWhen you\u2019re settled in and ready, I\u2019d like to invite you to the White House,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have a lot of things to talk about, but we\u2019re with you all the way.\u201d \u201cWell, thank you for the invitation,\u201d Mr. Zelensky replied. \u201cWe accept the invitation and look forward to the visit.\u201d According to the record, Mr. Trump made no mention of the desired investigations that he would raise later, but the promise of a White House meeting became a point of contention in the months to come. Text messages and testimony have indicated that the White House held up scheduling the promised meeting until Ukraine agreed to investigate Democrats. The new White House record conflicted with the readout of the call that the White House put out to the media at the time. The official readout in April said that Mr. Trump \u201cunderscored the unwavering support of the United States for Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity,\u201d and expressed support for efforts \u201cto root out corruption.\u201d According to the record released on Friday, Mr. Trump made no mention of either of those points.

ShearPRINT EDITIONNovember 20, 2019",
      "author": "Peter Baker",
      "content": "  Follow our live coverage of David Holmes and Fiona Hill\u2019s testimony in the Trump impeachment hearings. Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s two senior most aides pushed back against their colleague, Jennifer Williams, on Tuesday after she testified that she considered President Trump\u2019s phone call with Ukraine\u2019s president \u201cunusual\u201d because of its focus on domestic politics. \u201cI heard nothing wrong or improper on the call,\u201d Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, the vice president\u2019s national security adviser, said in a written statement released after her testimony. \u201cI had and have no concerns. Ms. Williams was also on the call, and as she testified, she never reported any personal or professional concerns to me, her direct supervisor, regarding the call. \u201cIn fact,\u201d he added, \u201cshe never reported any personal or professional concerns to any other member of the vice president\u2019s staff, including our chief of staff and the vice president.\u201d Marc Short, the vice president\u2019s chief of staff, went on Fox News to make the same point. \u201cShe said she found the call unusual yet she never raised any concerns with her supervisor General Kellogg, she never raised any concerns with the chief of staff, she never raised any concerns with the vice president,\u201d he said. He added: \u201cWe have impeachment in pursuit of a crime.\u201d Mr. Trump attacked Ms. Williams on Twitter on Sunday, writing that she should read the transcript of the call and then \u201cmeet with the other Never Trumpers, who I don\u2019t know & mostly never even heard of, & work out a better presidential attack!\u201d The two former officials testifying on the afternoon panel were both originally on the Republican witness list in hopes that their accounts would provide testimony that would be more useful to President Trump\u2019s defense. But while neither was as damning as the morning witnesses, both highlighted how unusual the president\u2019s actions were. \u201cI don\u2019t think that raising 2016 elections or Vice President Biden or these things I consider to be conspiracy theories that have been circulated by the Ukrainians\u201d were \u201cthings that we should be pursuing as part of our national security strategy with Ukraine,\u201d Kurt D. Volker, the president\u2019s former special envoy for Ukraine,  told the House Intelligence Committee. \u201cWe should be supporting Ukraine\u2019s democracy, reforms, its own fight against corruption domestically and the struggle against Russia and defense capabilities and these are at the heart of what we should be doing and I don\u2019t think pursuing these things serves a national interest,\u201d he added. Timothy Morrison, the former senior director for Europe and Ukraine at the National Security Council, said he did not think the president\u2019s July 25 call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine was inherently wrong or illegal, but feared it would ignite a political storm if it became public. \u201cI feared at the time of the call on July 25 how its disclosure would play in Washington\u2019s climate,\u201d he said. \u201cMy fears have been realized. I understand the gravity of these proceedings, but beg you not to lose sight of the military conflict underway in Ukraine today.\u201d During later questioning, Daniel S. Goldman, the Democratic counsel, asked: \u201cBut you would agree, right, that asking a foreign government to investigate a domestic political rival is inappropriate, would you not?\u201d \u201cIt is not what we recommend the president discuss,\u201d Mr. Morrison replied curtly. Mr. Volker portrayed himself as left out of key moments and unaware that others working for Mr. Trump were linking the release of American security aid to Ukraine committing to investigations of Democrats. Opening the second panel of the day, Mr. Volker sought to reconcile his original closed-door testimony with the accounts of other witnesses who came after him. \u201cI have learned many things that I did not know at the time of the events in question,\u201d he said in his opening statement. Among other things, he said that at the time he worked with Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal attorney, to seek assurances from Ukraine about investigations he was pushing, he did not understand those investigations to include former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. as a target nor did he know that they would be tied to release of the frozen security aid. \u201cI did not know of any linkage between the hold on security assistance and Ukraine pursuing investigations,\u201d Mr. Volker said. \u201cNo one had ever said that to me \u2014 and I never conveyed such a linkage to the Ukrainians.\u201d He recalled telling the Ukrainians \u201cthe opposite,\u201d that they did not need to do anything to get the hold lifted and that it would be taken care of. \u201cI did not know others were conveying a different message to them around the same time,\u201d he said. Mr. Volker sought to clarify why his testimony about the now-famous July 10 meeting at the White House differed from those of Fiona Hill, then the senior director for Europe and Russia at the National Security Council, and Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman, her Ukraine policy deputy. Ms. Hill and Colonel Vindman testified that John R. Bolton, then the national security adviser, ended the meeting abruptly when Gordon D. Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union, brought up the investigations and that some in the room took the conversation downstairs where it turned heated. Mr. Volker mentioned none of that in his original testimony. \u201cAs I remember, the meeting was essentially over when Ambassador Sondland made a general comment about investigations,\u201d he said on Tuesday. \u201cI think all of us thought it was inappropriate. The conversation did not continue and the meeting concluded. Later on, in the Ward Room, I may have been engaged in a side conversation or had already left the complex, because I do not recall further discussion regarding investigations or Burisma.\u201d More generally, he said he did not interpret the word Burisma to be tantamount to Mr. Biden. \u201cIn hindsight, I now understand that others saw the idea of investigating possible corruption involving the Ukrainian company Burisma as equivalent to investigating former Vice President Biden. I saw them as very different \u2014 the former being appropriate and unremarkable, the latter being unacceptable. In retrospect, I should have seen that connection differently, and had I done so, I would have raised my own objections.\u201d Mr. Volker expressed annoyance at being lumped together with Mr. Sondland and Energy Secretary Rick Perry as \u201cthree amigos,\u201d as if they were somehow indistinguishable, and he rejected the notion that he was part of an irregular foreign policy channel. The term \u201cthree amigos\u201d has come to characterize how the usual foreign policy process was warped by Mr. Trump\u2019s interest in obtaining damaging information about Democrats from Ukraine. It originated from an interview Mr. Sondland gave to Ukrainian television when he said \u201cwe have what are called the three amigos,\u201d naming Mr. Volker, Mr. Perry and himself. Mr. Volker in his testimony objected to the name and the implication. \u201cI\u2019ve never used that term and frankly cringe when I hear it,\u201d he said. In his mind, he said, he associated the phrase with his mentor, Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who died last year, and two allies who supported a troop surge in Iraq in 2006 and 2007, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut, who has since left the Senate. Mr. Volker said he was not part of a shadow foreign policy because he was the officially designated diplomat assigned to help resolve Ukraine\u2019s war with Russia. \u201cMy role was not some irregular channel, but the official channel,\u201d he said, noting that he reported to Rex W. Tillerson, the secretary of state who appointed him, and Mike Pompeo, his successor, and coordinated with diplomats and White House officials. Democratic lawmakers responded angrily to attacks on Colonel Vindman,  who testified during the morning session, as the White House and Republicans sought to discredit the colonel in real time during his appearance before the committee. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of insinuations and there\u2019s been a lot suggestions, maybe, that your service is somehow not to be trusted,\u201d said Representative Sean Patrick Maloney, Democrat of New York. He accused Republicans of trying to \u201cair out some allegations with no basis and proof, but they just want to get them out there and hope maybe some of those strands of spaghetti I guess will stick on the wall if they keep throwing them.\u201d His angry remarks came after the official, taxpayer-funded Twitter account of the White House posted a critical quote about Colonel Vindman from Mr. Morrison, his former boss at the National Security Council, who testified later in the day on a separate panel. Earlier, Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio had cited that comment as well as criticism from Ms. Hill, Colonel Vindman\u2019s former boss at the National Security Council. \u201cAny idea why they have those impressions?\u201d Mr. Jordan inquired. Colonel Vindman, who apparently came prepared for the criticism, pulled out a copy the performance evaluation Ms. Hill wrote about him in July and read aloud from it. \u201cAlex is a top one percent military officer and the best army officer I have worked with in my 15 years of government service,\u201d Colonel Vindman said, quoting Ms. Hill. \u201cHe is brilliant, unflappable, and exercises excellent judgment.\u201d Republicans also questioned the loyalty of Colonel Vindman, an American citizen and decorated Army combat veteran who was born in Ukraine, by asking him about three instances when Oleksandr Danylyuk, the director of Ukraine\u2019s national security council, had approached to offer him the job of defense minister in Kyiv. Under questioning by the committee\u2019s Republican counsel, Colonel Vindman confirmed the offers and testified that he repeatedly declined, dismissing the idea out of hand and reporting the approaches to his superiors and to counterintelligence officials. The line of questioning seemed to be designed, at least in part, to feed doubts about Colonel Vindman\u2019s commitment to the United States, the subject of a wave of character attacks on him by Mr. Trump\u2019s allies. Fox News quickly picked up on the tactic, sending out a news alert moments after Mr. Castor finished: \u201cVindman says Ukrainian official offered him the job of Ukrainian defense minister.\u201d Mr. Maloney said he was particularly outraged by questions from a Republican lawmaker questioning why Colonel Vindman wore his Army dress uniform to the hearing. \u201cThat dress uniform includes a breast plate that has a combat infantryman badge on it and a purple ribbon,\u201d Mr. Maloney said. \u201cIt seems if there is someone who should wear that uniform, it\u2019s someone who has a breast plate on it.\u201d Two senior national security officials at the White House challenged Mr. Trump\u2019s description of his call with the Ukraine president as \u201cperfect,\u201d testifying on Tuesday about how concerned they were as they listened in real time to Mr. Trump appealing for an investigation of Mr. Biden. Colonel Vindman testified that he was so disturbed by the call that he reported it to the council\u2019s top lawyer. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe what I was hearing,\u201d he said under questioning about his first thoughts when he heard Mr. Trump\u2019s mention of investigations into Mr. Biden and an unproven theory that it was Ukraine, not Russia, that interfered in the 2016 election. \u201cIt was probably an element of shock, that maybe in certain regards, my worst fear of how our Ukraine policy could play out was playing out, and how this was likely to have significant implications for U.S. national security.\u201d Earlier, Colonel Vindman explained why he felt it was his \u201cduty\u201d to report his concerns to John Eisenberg, the top lawyer at the National Security Council. \u201cIt is improper for the president of the United States to demand a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen and political opponent.\u201d Ms;Williams, a national security aide to Mr. Pence, said she found the president\u2019s call unusual because it included discussion of a \u201cdomestic political matter.\u201d Their testimony kicked off three days of hearings featuring nine diplomats and national security officials as Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee continue to build their case that Mr. Trump abused his power by trying to enlist Ukraine to publicly commit to investigations that would discredit Mr. Biden, a leading political rival, and other Democrats. In a cabinet meeting as the hearing unfolded, Mr. Trump praised his allies and dismissed the hearings as a \u201ckangaroo court,\u201d saying, \u201cRepublicans are absolutely killing it, because it\u2019s a big scam.\u201d Colonel Vindman and Ms. Williams both testified that they were never aware of any other national security officials in the United States government who supported the decision to withhold nearly $400 million in security aid for Ukraine, which both said was directed by the White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney. Both witnesses said withholding the military assistance from Ukraine was damaging to relations between the two countries and to Ukraine\u2019s ability to confront Russian aggression. Representative Mike Quigley of Illinois asked Colonel Vindman whether anyone else supported the decision to freeze the aid. \u201cNo one from the national security?\u201d Mr. Quigley asked. \u201cNone,\u201d Colonel Vindman said. \u201cNo one from the State Department?\u201d \u201cCorrect.\u201d \u201cNo one from the Department of Defense? \u201cCorrect.\u201d Ms. Williams testified that President Volodymyr  Zelensky of Ukraine told Vice President Mike Pence during a Sept. 1 meeting that continuing to withhold the aid would indicate that United States support for Ukraine was wavering, giving Russia a boost in the ongoing conflict between the two countries. \u201cAny signal or sign that U.S. support was wavering would be construed by Russia as potentially an opportunity for them to strengthen their own hand in Ukraine,\u201d Ms. Williams said, relating what Mr. Zelensky told Mr. Pence. Representative Devin Nunes of California, the top Republican on the committee, sought to turn the focus away from Mr. Trump to Mr. Biden, leading the witnesses through a series of questions intended to suggest that the former vice president had intervened in Ukraine\u2019s domestic affairs to benefit his son, Hunter Biden, despite the lack of evidence. Mr. Biden, as vice president, pressured Ukrainian officials to fire a prosecutor who was seen as tolerating corruption in keeping with the policy of the United States, European allies and international financial organizations at the time. But Mr. Nunes suggested that Mr. Biden was acting to benefit his son, who was on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company that had been investigated for corruption. \u201cDid you know that Joe Biden called Ukrainian President Poroshenko at least three times in February 2016 after the president and owner of Burisma\u2019s home was raided on February 2 by the state prosecutor\u2019s office?\u201d Mr. Nunes asked, referring to Petro O. Poroshenko, then the president. \u201cNot at the time,\u201d Ms. Williams answered. She added: \u201cI\u2019ve become aware of that through this proceeding.\u201d Mr. Nunes asked a series of similar questions and then repeated them for Colonel Vindman. Neither witness was working on the issue at the time,  so neither could offer information to about it. But Mr. Nunes used the opportunity to introduce his allegations, anyway. He also tried repeatedly to extract information from Colonel Vindman about the identity of the whistle-blower who filed a complaint about Mr. Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine, drawing objections from the colonel\u2019s lawyer. At one point, things turned testy when Mr. Nunes addressed Colonel Vindman as \u201cMr. Vindman.\u201d \u201cRanking member, it\u2019s Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, please,\u201d he shot back.  ",

      "author": "Mark Leibovich",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Gordon D. Sondland began his day looking strangely happy. The American ambassador to the European Union wore an amused grin as he walked into his hearing and took his seat and oath. Then he started spreading heat through the highest levels of the Trump administration. \u201cWas there a quid pro quo?\u201d asked Mr. Sondland, the rich Oregon hotelier whose $1 million donation to President Trump\u2019s inauguration got him far more than he bargained for. \u201cThe answer is yes.\u201d Not only that, but Mr. Sondland implicated pretty much every principal over his head and under his bus. \u201cEveryone was in the loop, it was no secret,\u201d he said. The secretary of state and vice president and acting chief of staff and the president\u2019s roving private lawyer, among others. Mr. Sondland also said that the pressure campaign to get Ukraine to open an investigation into Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son came \u201cat the express direction\u201d of the president. There are certain days on Capitol Hill when things take on an extra little crackle. Photographers jockey a little more frantically, and staff members walk faster and speak in heightened whispers, as if something close to momentous is about to drop. This felt like one of those days. This was one of those days. For starters, there was the discordant vibe of liberation written all over Mr. Sondland\u2019s face while detailing his bromance rapport with a real-life president. These were just a couple of business guys, doing diplomacy, trash-talking other leaders. President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine \u201cloves your ass,\u201d Mr. Sondland reportedly told Mr. Trump in a phone call, according to an American Embassy official in Kyiv who overheard the call. \u201cThat\u2019s how President Trump and I communicated,\u201d Mr. Sondland confirmed. \u201cA lot of four-letter words,\u201d he said, chuckling. \u201cIn this case, three letter.\u201d This was something beyond aristocratic ease. Throughout the morning, Mr. Sondland bore the appearance of a person who knew he was saving himself, as if he was no longer concerned with staying within the jagged loyalty matrix and \u201cirregular channels\u201d and omerta codes of Trump World. He was done with all this, it seemed. Perhaps he was tired of being heckled and sent hate mail and having his hotels protested. Everything about Sondland-on-the-Hill on Wednesday screamed of a Past-the-Rubicon figure who just wanted his rich-guy life back in Oregon. Who knew whether what he said was something so \u201cbig\u201d that it would change minds or switch allegiances or captivate citizens who are beyond weary of these Trump-era trench wars? Or whether the testimony of Mr. Sondland, a muddled figure in this story with a decidedly situational memory, could bring any shared clarity to this matter? But at the very least, Wednesday \u2014 \u201cDay 4,\u201d as these hearings have been ordered, Iran-hostage-crisis style \u2014 felt different from what came before. Mr. Sondland has been a big Republican donor for a long time. His appointment as the envoy to the European Union was in keeping with the traditional, swampy rules of how ambassadorial plums are doled out \u2014 preferably somewhere nice, maybe exotic, definitely not dangerous. Ideally, this plum ambassadorship would not land him in the red-hot middle of a fast-cooking impeachment crucible. Well, you can\u2019t have everything. \u201cI WANT NOTHING!\u201d the president tweeted just after lunch. It was not clear what this meant, exactly. Things got less fun for Mr. Sondland as the day wore on. His lawyer asked Representative Adam B. Schiff, the California Democrat who is the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, if he could do a shorter lunch break so that his client could catch a plane back to Europe. Mr. Schiff denied the request. The proceeding settled into a more familiar rhythm of partisan back and forth. Republicans on the committee homed in on whether Mr. Sondland could really characterize the campaign against Ukraine as a \u201cquid pro quo,\u201d as he did explicitly in his opening statement. Mr. Sondland said he merely \u201cpresumed\u201d that aid to Ukraine was contingent on investigating the Bidens. \u201cYou really have no testimony today that ties President Trump to a scheme to withhold from Ukraine in exchange for these investigations,\u201d charged Representative Michael R. Turner, Republican of Ohio. \u201cOther than my own presumption,\u201d Mr. Sondland allowed. \u201cWhich is nothing!\u201d Mr. Turner barked. There were several tense exchanges like this, originating from both Democrats and Republicans on the panel. Attentions flagged and members drifted in and out. Mr. Sondland showed a weird knack for seeming momentarily flustered and then deflecting into punchy asides. \u201cI remember the first girl I kissed,\u201d he blurted out in response to a question about a phone call with the president. Wait, what? (Never mind, not important.) And there was Representative Jim Jordan, the vehement Ohio Republican. \u201cThere was no direct evidence whatsoever,\u201d Mr. Jordan shouted after 3 p.m. He pounded on the fact that the millions of dollars in foreign aid was eventually sent to Ukraine. \u201cThey got the money, they got the money,\u201d he said. \u201cGod bless America, it all worked out.\u201d But this was not the last word, and the ambassador did not dash out to catch his plane. Mr. Sondland was soon getting pulverized by Representative Sean Patrick Maloney, Democrat of New York, who pressed him on exactly who Ukraine\u2019s investigation of Mr. Biden and his son would benefit. It took Mr. Sondland a few attempts to spit out the obvious answer. \u201cI assume President Trump would benefit,\u201d Mr. Sondland said finally. \u201cThere we have it, see?\u201d Mr. Maloney said, as the gallery broke into applause. \u201cIt didn\u2019t hurt a bit, did it?\u201d This appeared to hurt the ambassador\u2019s feelings. \u201cI really resent what you\u2019re trying to do,\u201d Mr. Sondland said. In some other preserve of privilege, he would have complained to the man\u2019s supervisor. But this was not that. Mr. Maloney headed off into a sarcastic recitation of the witness\u2019s zigzagging accounts. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a doozy of a statement from you here this morning,\u201d he reminded Mr. Sondland. Still, Mr. Sondland kept up some banter. When Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, Democrat of Illinois, noted that an earlier witness, Timothy Morrison, a former National Security Council official, had referred to Mr. Sondland as \u201cthe Gordon problem,\u201d Mr. Sondland cheerily replied, \u201cThat\u2019s what my wife calls me.\u201d A few committee members asked the beleaguered ambassador how well he actually knew Mr. Trump: How many times had they spoken and how often and did he consider the president a friend? In a sense, getting into a relationship like this is the essence of why so many plutocrats give money to politicians \u2014 a chance to be a player, to joke around at the highest levels. They can regale friends about their exchanges and hold up their cellphone when he calls. Look, the president even called him a \u201cnice guy.\u201d But the shine does wear off, and quite predictably with this president. \u201cYou know, on Oct. 8 of this year, the president tweeted that you are a really good man and a great American,\u201d Mr. Krishnamoorthi pointed out to Mr. Sondland. \u201cAnd of course, on Nov. 8, one month later, he said let me just tell you, I hardly know the gentleman.\u201d \u201cEasy come, easy go,\u201d Mr. Sondland said. This was one truism about Washington alliances that Mr. Sondland appeared to have fully absorbed. And yet, remarkably, the ambassador had the same job to go back to, and on behalf of the same president. He made his flight back to Brussels, though not without incident. Quoting a fellow passenger, CNN reported that Mr. Sondland placed his carry-on bag in the wrong overhead bin. How much humiliation can one man take? This was a lot to unpack. \u201cMy whole day has been like this,\u201d he said, reportedly.",

Sought to Interview Whistle-Blower in Ukraine CaseAgents asked to speak with him last month but never did, though the bureau made clear to his lawyers that he was not the target of a continuing investigation.By Adam Goldman and Julian E. BarnesPRINT EDITIONNovember 21, 2019",
      "author": "Adam Goldman",
      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 The F.B.I. sought last month to interview the whistle-blower who helped ignite the impeachment inquiry as a witness in a continuing investigation, several people familiar with the matter said. The interview never took place. It is not clear why agents wanted to talk to the whistle-blower, a C.I.A. analyst, or how interested they remain in speaking to him. The F.B.I. contacted lawyers for the whistle-blower and did not use his name in making the request. The whistle-blower\u2019s account of the effort by President Trump, the president\u2019s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani, and administration officials to push Ukraine to pursue investigations that would benefit Mr. Trump politically became a road map for the House\u2019s impeachment investigation and has been largely corroborated by subsequent testimony. The F.B.I. made clear to his lawyers that the whistle-blower was not the target of any continuing investigations, according to people familiar with the matter. The F.B.I. request could be a routine, \u201ccheck-the-box\u201d request, according to one person briefed on the request. But it also could be related to the more substantive issues about the Ukraine pressure campaign raised in the whistle-blower complaint, according to people familiar with the matter. Yahoo News first reported that the F.B.I. was seeking to speak with the whistle-blower. In August, after learning about the whistle-blower complaint, the Justice Department\u2019s criminal division reviewed the whistle-blower complaint and found that there was no violation of campaign finance laws. The next month, as the complaint became public, the Justice Department announced that it had determined no further action was necessary on the complaint. Mr. Giuliani is under scrutiny by federal prosecutors in Manhattan, at least in part for his role in efforts to remove the United States ambassador to Ukraine, Marie L. Yovanovitch. Mr. Giuliani was also a key player in the efforts to press Ukraine\u2019s government to pursue the investigations sought by Mr. Trump in his July 25 call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. They included investigations into former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and a debunked theory about Ukrainians meddling in the 2016 election. The F.B.I. might also have wanted to learn about threats made against the whistle-blower. The C.I.A. is providing protection to the whistle-blower, who is an agency employee continuing to work on intelligence matters. Still, the F.B.I. has not renewed its request to speak to the whistle-blower since it first asked several weeks ago, according to a person familiar with the matter. Since the original F.B.I. request, the issue of interviewing the whistle-blower has become more fraught and entangled in partisan politics. House Republicans have demanded the chance to interview the whistle-blower as part of the impeachment inquiry, but Democrats have resisted, withdrawing an earlier request to speak to him. House Democrats believe there is no reason to call in the whistle-blower since his information was secondhand, and they now have sworn testimony from witnesses more directly involved in the July 25 call as well as people more directly involved in the pressure campaign on Ukraine. An F.B.I. spokeswoman declined to comment. Andrew P. Bakaj, the lead lawyer for the whistle-blower, also declined to comment but said that it remained critical for the identity of his client to be protected for his safety. Although the testimony in the impeachment hearings has centered on witnesses with more direct knowledge of Mr. Trump\u2019s pressure campaign, the whistle-blower remains a critical, but mysterious, figure. Republicans continue to press witnesses about whether they spoke to people who could be the whistle-blower. Mr. Bakaj has offered to have his client answer written questions from the committee. But House Republicans have continued to focus on the whistle-blower\u2019s push to make public the Ukraine pressure campaign, as part of a larger effort to demonstrate partisan motivations. Republicans have suggested the whistle-blower was partisan because he was originally detailed to the White House under the Obama administration to work on Ukrainian affairs and was a registered Democrat. The whistle-blower has remained an obsession among right-wing news media and Trump allies who have speculated about the analyst\u2019s identity and political affiliation. Several right-wing websites have purported to identify the whistle-blower, but no mainstream news outlet or even top-tier conservative site has identified the officer who filed the complaint. Republicans have frequently noted that before filing his complaint, the whistle-blower met with a Democratic staff member of the House Intelligence Committee. \u201cThe Democrats have zeroed in on an anonymous whistle-blower complaint that was cooked up in cooperation with the Democrats on this very committee,\u201d Representative Devin Nunes, Republican of California, who is the ranking member of the intelligence committee, said Wednesday. \u201cThey lied to the American people about that cooperation and refused to let us question the whistle-blower to discover the truth.\u201d Democrats have said such charges are misleading and emphasized that the concerns raised in the whistle-blower\u2019s complaint have been largely confirmed by other witness testimony in the impeachment inquiry. Mr. Bakaj reiterated his position that efforts to focus on the whistle-blower or reveal his identity reflected a \u201cdesperation to deflect from the substance of the whistle-blower complaint.\u201d",

      "author": "The New York Times",
      "content": " Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman, the top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council, appeared in front of the House Intelligence Committee on the third day of public impeachment hearings. Mr. Vindman, who listened in on the July 25 phone call between President Trump and Ukraine\u2019s leader, said, \u201cI was concerned by the call.\u201d The following is Mr. Vindman\u2019s opening statement, as prepared for delivery and released by the House Intelligence Committee on Tuesday. Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member, thank you for the opportunity to address the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence with respect to the activities relating to Ukraine and my role in the events under investigation. Background I have dedicated my entire professional life to the United States of America. For more than two decades, it has been my honor to serve as an officer in the United States Army. As an infantry officer, I served multiple overseas tours, including South Korea and Germany, and I was deployed to Iraq for combat operations. Since 2008, I have been a Foreign Area Officer specializing in European and Eurasian politico-military affairs. I served in the United States embassies in Kyiv, Ukraine and Moscow, Russia. In Washington, D.C., I was a politico-military affairs officer for Russia for the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff where I drafted the Armed Forces\u2019 global campaign plan to counter Russian aggression and Russian malign influence. In July 2018, I was asked to serve at the White House\u2019s National Security Council. At the NSC I am the principal adviser to the National Security Advisor and the President on Ukraine and the other countries in my portfolio. My role at the NSC is to develop, coordinate, and implement plans and policies to manage the full range of diplomatic, informational, military, and economic national security issues for the countries in my portfolio. My core function is to coordinate policy with departments and agencies partners. The Committee has heard from many of my colleagues about the strategic importance of Ukraine as a bulwark against Russian aggression. It is important to note that our country\u2019s policy of supporting Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity, promoting Ukrainian prosperity, and strengthening a free and democratic Ukraine, as a counter to Russian aggression, has been a consistent, bipartisan foreign policy objective and strategy across various administrations, both Democrat and Republican, and that President Zelensky\u2019s election, in April 2019, created an unprecedented opportunity to realize our strategic objectives. Relevant Events In the Spring of 2019, I became aware of two disruptive actors \u2014 primarily Ukraine\u2019s then-Prosecutor General Yuri Lutsenko and former Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, President Trump\u2019s personal attorney \u2014 promoting false information that undermined the United States\u2019 Ukraine policy. The NSC and its inter-agency partners, including the State Department, grew increasingly concerned about the impact that such information was having on our country\u2019s ability to achieve our national security objectives. April 21, 2019: President Trump Calls Ukraine President Zelensky On April 21, 2019, President Trump called President Zelensky on April 21, 2019, to congratulate him for his victory. I was the staff officer who produced the call materials and was one of the staff officers who listened to the call. The call was positive and President Trump expressed his desire to work with President Zelensky and extended an invitation to visit the White House. May 2019: Inauguration Delegation Goes to Ukraine In May, I attended the inauguration of President Zelensky as part of the Presidential delegation led by Secretary Perry. Following the visit, the members of the delegation provided President Trump a debriefing offering a positive assessment of President Zelensky and his team. After this debriefing, President Trump signed a congratulatory letter to President Zelensky and extended an invitation to visit the White House. July 10, 2019: Danylyuk Visit On July 10, 2019, Oleksandr Danylyuk, then Ukraine\u2019s National Security Advisor, visited Washington, D.C. for a meeting with National Security Advisor Bolton. Ambassadors Volker and Sondland and Secretary Rick Perry also attended the meeting. I attended the meeting with Dr. Hill. Volodymyr Zelensky was elected President of Ukraine in a landslide victory on a unity, reform, and anti-corruption platform. We fully anticipated the Ukrainians would raise the issue of a meeting between the two presidents. Ambassador Bolton cut the meeting short when Ambassador Sondland started to speak about the requirement that Ukraine deliver specific investigations in order to secure the meeting with President Trump. Following this meeting, there was a short debriefing during which Amb. Sondland emphasized the importance of Ukraine delivering the investigations into the 2016 election, the Bidens, and Burisma. I stated to Ambassador Sondland that this was inappropriate and had nothing to do with national security. Dr. Hill also asserted his comments were improper. Following the meeting Dr. Hill and I had agreed to report the incident to the NSC\u2019s lead counsel, Mr. John Eisenberg. July 25, 2019: Parliamentary Election Call On July 21, 2019, President Zelensky\u2019s party won parliamentary elections in another landslide victory. The NSC proposed that President Trump call President Zelensky to congratulate him. On July 25, 2019, the call occurred. I listened in on the call in the Situation Room with White House colleagues. I was concerned by the call, what I heard was improper, and I reported my concerns to Mr. Eisenberg. It is improper for the President of the United States to demand a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen and political opponent. It was also clear that if Ukraine pursued an investigation into the 2016 election, the Bidens, and Burisma, it would be interpreted as a partisan play. This would undoubtedly result in Ukraine losing bipartisan support, undermine U.S. national security, and advance Russia\u2019s strategic objectives in the region. I want to emphasize to the Committee that when I reported my concerns \u2014 on July 10, relating to Ambassador Sondland, and on July 25, relating to the President \u2014 I did so out of a sense of duty. I privately reported my concerns, in official channels, to the proper authorities in the chain of command. My intent was to raise these concerns because they had significant national security implications for our country. I never thought I would be sitting here testifying in front of this committee and the American public, about my actions. When I reported my concerns, my only thought was to act properly and to carry out duty. Following each of my reports to Mr. Eisenberg, I immediately returned to work to advance the President\u2019s and our country\u2019s foreign policy objectives. I focused on what I have done throughout my career, promoting America\u2019s national security interests. Conclusion I want to take a moment to recognize the courage of my colleagues who have appeared and are scheduled to appear before this Committee. I want to state that the vile character attacks on these distinguished and honorable public servants is reprehensible. It is natural to disagree and engage in spirited debate, this has been our custom since the time of our Founding Fathers, but we are better than callow and cowardly attacks. The uniform I wear today is that of the United States Army. The members of our all- volunteer force are made up of a patchwork of people from all ethnicities, religions, and socio-economic backgrounds who come together under a common oath to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States of America. We do not serve any particular political party, we serve the nation. I am humbled to come before you today as one of many who serve in the most distinguished and able military in the world. The Army is the only profession I have ever known. As a young man I decided that I wanted to spend my life serving the nation that gave my family refuge from authoritarian oppression, and for the last twenty years it has been an honor to represent and protect this great country. Next month will mark 40 years since my family arrived in the United States as refugees. When my father was 47 years old he left behind his entire life and the only home he had ever known to start over in the United States so that his three sons could have better, safer lives. His courageous decision inspired a deep sense of gratitude in my brothers and myself and instilled in us a sense of duty and service. All three of us have served or are currently serving in the military. Our collective military service is a special part of our family\u2019s story in America. I also recognize that my simple act of appearing here today, just like the courage of my colleagues who have also truthfully testified before this Committee, would not be tolerated in many places around the world. In Russia, my act of expressing my concerns to the chain of command in an official and private channel would have severe personal and professional repercussions and offering public testimony involving the President would surely cost me my life. I am grateful for my father\u2019s brave act of hope 40 years ago and for the privilege of being an American citizen and public servant, where I can live free of fear for mine and my family\u2019s safety. Dad, my sitting here today, in the US Capitol talking to our elected officials is proof that you made the right decision forty years ago to leave the Soviet Union and come here to United States of America in search of a better life for our family. Do not worry, I will be fine for telling the truth. Thank you again for your consideration, and I would be happy to answer your questions.",

      "author": "Maggie Haberman",
      "content": " President Trump may find himself in a political box of his own making when the Supreme Court rules on the fate of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. If the court decides that the administration has the right to end the program, known as DACA, Mr. Trump will face a consequence he has tried to put off for years: news coverage of efforts by the government to deport thousands of young immigrants in the midst of what is certain to be a difficult re-election battle. In oral arguments on Tuesday, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. suggested that there could be extensive human cost to overturning the program, and that it would need to be mitigated. Still, a ruling that supports the administration\u2019s position sets up a situation in which Mr. Trump \u2014 who at times has praised the program and at others condemned it \u2014 will face potentially treacherous crosswinds. The president, who is often pulled by what he thinks his supporters who oppose both legal and illegal immigration might want, has vowed to keep a campaign promise to end DACA, one of President Barack Obama\u2019s singular efforts. At the same time, Mr. Trump has tried to argue that it would not be his fault that the program ended, but the Supreme Court\u2019s. Based on comments by Chief Justice Roberts and other conservative justices, the court seems poised to let it happen. But the solicitor general, Noel J. Francisco, put perhaps an unintended fine point on the issue for the Trump administration when he told the court on Tuesday, \u201cWe own it.\u201d That might end up being the problem for Mr. Trump, if he has any hope of peeling off support from Latinos and from voters who have recoiled at the administration\u2019s more aggressive immigration policies, like border separations. Charlie Dent, a former moderate Republican congressman from Pennsylvania and a CNN commentator, said that Mr. Trump would have \u201cbad options or bad outcomes\u201d unless the court ruled that the program was legal. \u201cI think he\u2019s in a bind politically,\u201d said Mr. Dent, who retired last year. \u201cThese young people will be at risk for being thrown out.\u201d He said that Mr. Trump\u2019s aides might \u201cthink they can rally up their base on this thing.\u201d But it is at a cost with the broader population, Mr. Dent added. Officials with the White House and the Trump campaign did not respond to an email seeking comment. But Mr. Trump is aware of the politics and how poorly it may play out for him if young immigrants are facing deportation before the 2020 election, according to people close to the White House. Even when he was ordering Jeff Sessions, the attorney general at the time, to find a solution to DACA, Mr. Trump was asking close aides how he could get out of the political jam he found himself in. \u201cPresumably, there will be discretion about how aggressively various laws are enforced,\u201d said Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster, \u201cbut it does create a political challenge because, consistently, 80 percent of Americans have supported allowing the DACA kids to stay.\u201d Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster who has worked for the pro-immigration group FWD.us, said that ending DACA helped reinforce the negative feelings about Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration policies. \u201cWe know from polling that Americans overwhelmingly support DACA. They oppose Trump\u2019s efforts to terminate DACA,\u201d Mr. Garin said. \u201cIt reinforces all the other negatives that Trump has established.\u201d The program, which was announced by Mr. Obama in 2012, lets young people brought to the United States as children apply for a temporary status that lasts two years and can be renewed. It does not offer a pathway to citizenship, something that Mr. Trump\u2019s most hard-line supporters are against. A national survey by Mr. Garin\u2019s firm of 1,202 voters conducted at the end of the summer showed that 76 percent of all voters said they supported the DACA program. That included 41 percent who strongly supported it, according to a memo the firm wrote. Among a demographic that has supported Mr. Trump, white working-class voters without a college degree, there was support from 70 percent of the group, according to Mr. Garin\u2019s survey. Mark Krikorian, an immigration restrictionist and the executive director for the Center for Immigration Studies, said that Mr. Trump could theoretically defer making a decision during the election year. With such a move, Mr. Trump\u2019s White House could say the administration will stop processing renewals of DACA status so that it does not kick in until after the election. \u201cIn the middle of an election year, I think the White House can genuinely say that this is not a good time to broker an immigration deal, not for anyone,\u201d Mr. Krikorian said. \u201cThat\u2019s a plausible position for them that may limit the political challenge that they face\u201d by ending the program immediately. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision will also reinforce the challenge any discussion of an immigration deal faces in Congress, even as Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, has tried to push through a broader frame for an immigration compromise. However, White House officials said that they were aware that any broad deal would be difficult to push through right now. \u201cWhat\u2019s so frustrating is that 80 percent of Americans also support a secure border, and Congress has thus far seemed unable to put those two 80 percent issues together in a very limited immigration bill,\u201d Mr. Ayres said. Mr. Dent agreed that Mr. Trump \u201chad an opportunity for real compromise over the last few years\u201d on immigration issues. \u201cHe just couldn\u2019t get there\u201d with all the cross pressures, Mr. Dent said.",

Official Will Testify in Impeachment HearingA veteran diplomat, Mr. Hale will be pressed on the agency\u2019s decision to recall the ambassador to Ukraine after a concerted smear campaign against her.By Catie EdmondsonPRINT EDITIONNovember 21, 2019",
      "author": "Catie Edmondson",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Why Marie L. Yovanovitch, the ambassador to Ukraine, was recalled from her post two months early has become a central question in the Democratic-led impeachment inquiry into whether President Trump tried to pressure the country to investigate his political rivals. On Wednesday, David Hale, the State Department\u2019s No. 3 official, will be pressed to provide answers. Mr. Hale\u2019s testimony before the House Intelligence Committee will be another weighty entry in his nearly four-decade career as a diplomat. As the under secretary of state for political affairs, Mr. Hale was among the department officials who grappled with how to handle the smear campaign led by Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, to oust Ms. Yovanovitch. Ms. Yovanovitch and Philip T. Reeker, the acting assistant secretary in charge of European and Eurasian Affairs, told investigators that they asked Mr. Hale to talk to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about issuing a statement in support of Ms. Yovanovitch. No such statement was ever made. Mr. Hale testified behind closed doors this month that agency officials did not do so because they worried that it would \u201conly fuel further negative reaction\u201d and thought it would be better \u201cto try to contain this and wait it out.\u201d He also testified that he believed Ms. Yovanovitch was doing a \u201cvery good job\u201d in Ukraine and asked her to consider staying on longer, and that officials at the State Department, including Mr. Pompeo, did not find the allegations at the heart of the smear campaign to be credible. Mr. Hale, who has taken on missions in Pakistan and Israel and to negotiate peace in the Middle East, is at the State Department at a time when career officials are accusing their leadership of abandoning veteran diplomats criticized by Mr. Trump and letting the president\u2019s personal political agenda infect foreign policy. In gripping testimony before the House Intelligence Committee last week, Ms. Yovanovitch offered a scathing indictment of the department\u2019s leadership, calling top officials\u2019 reluctance to push back against the attacks a failure \u201cto push back as foreign and corrupt interests apparently hijacked our Ukraine policy.\u201d Appointed ambassador to Jordan by President George W. Bush, Mr. Hale also served as the ambassador to Lebanon and Pakistan and the special envoy for Middle East peace in the Obama administration. The Senate unanimously confirmed him to his current position in 2018. As a child, he has said, he was inspired by his grandparents\u2019 expansive travels to pursue a career as a diplomat, and while attending Georgetown University\u2019s School of Foreign Service, he found a mentor and guide in Madeleine Albright, who taught Eastern European studies. When she became secretary of state under President Bill Clinton, Mr. Hale followed, working as her executive assistant. \u201cShe taught me that while our strength is greatly enhanced through alliances and partnerships, there is no substitute for American leadership,\u201d Mr. Hale testified at his confirmation hearing last year. \u201cI am convinced American values are at the core of our nation\u2019s success and influence and must remain there for our success to continue.\u201d",

He kept quiet on Ukraine and impeachment.By Peter BakerPRINT EDITIONBolton (on Twitter) Teases City Eager to Hear His Story|November 23, 2019, Page A16",
      "author": "Peter Baker",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 For weeks, Washington has waited to hear what he had to say. So when John R. Bolton, the president\u2019s former national security adviser, popped back up on Twitter on Friday morning with a teasing message, it sent the town, well, all atwitter. \u201cGlad to be back on Twitter after more than two months,\u201d Mr. Bolton wrote. \u201cFor the backstory, stay tuned\u2026\u2026..\u201d Was he finally going to describe his internal opposition to President Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure Ukraine for damaging information about his Democratic rivals? Would he confirm that he called the whole thing a metaphorical \u201cdrug deal\u201d and considered Rudolph W. Giuliani a \u201chand grenade who\u2019s going to blow everybody up\u201d? Sorry, no go. Over the course of the day, Mr. Bolton posted a few more messages \u2014 not about the Ukraine matter that has propelled his former boss to the edge of impeachment but about his own two-month battle to \u201cliberate\u201d his Twitter account, as he put it, from a White House that refused to give it back when he resigned in September in a flurry of acrimony. Anyone who knows Mr. Bolton should never have thought he would actually spill on Twitter. A Yale-trained lawyer, he has made clear he is waiting for a court to tell him whether he has to testify, relying on a lawsuit filed by a deputy that will be argued on Dec. 10. While former colleagues have issued public statements, Mr. Bolton\u2019s legal team believes making any public comments could be interpreted as waiving any claim of immunity \u2014 he could hardly claim confidentiality with Congress and then tell all on Twitter. But Washington got excited all the same. And Mr. Bolton seemed to enjoy the tease. He issued a handful of additional tweets, spaced out with hours in between, building up interest. Along the way, he attracted tens of thousands of new followers, topping 800,000 by the end of the business day. \u201cWe have now liberated the Twitter account, previously suppressed unfairly in the aftermath of my resignation as National Security Advisor,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMore to come\u2026..\u201d Three hours later, he added: \u201cRe: speaking up \u2014 since resigning as National Security Advisor, the @WhiteHouse refused to return access to my personal Twitter account. Out of fear of what I may say? To those who speculated I went into hiding, I\u2019m sorry to disappoint!\u201d Two and a half hours after that, he continued: \u201cIn full disclosure, the @WhiteHouse never returned access to my Twitter account. Thank you to @twitter for standing by their community standards and rightfully returning control of my account.\u201d Mr. Bolton, it turned out, had turned over control of his personal Twitter account to the White House when he joined the National Security Council last year. An avid Twitter user since 2010, Mr. Bolton brought a strong following to the new job and wanted it back when he left. In fact, he used the account moments after leaving the White House in September to accuse the president of not telling the truth about his departure. After Mr. Trump said on Twitter on Sept. 10 that he had fired him, Mr. Bolton tweeted 12 minutes later that that was not true. \u201cI offered to resign last night and President Trump said, \u2018Let\u2019s talk about it tomorrow,\u2019\u201d Mr. Bolton wrote, without elaborating. That was his last tweet until Friday. Shortly afterward, he discovered that he no longer had control of the account. The White House had evidently changed his password and his verifying email address. \u201cThe White House attached software to the account,\u201d Mr. Bolton said by telephone on Friday. \u201cThey would not give it back. A representative of mine spoke with John Eisenberg, who said he would get it released, and it never happened. So finally we went to Twitter.\u201d Mr. Eisenberg is the top National Security Council lawyer and himself a player in the Ukraine drama. It was not clear what kind of software Mr. Bolton was referring to, but it appeared related to government efforts to archive messages in keeping with presidential records law. Mr. Trump denied freezing Mr. Bolton\u2019s account. \u201cNo, of course not. Of course not,\u201d he said when asked on Friday on \u201cFox and Friends.\u201d \u201cNo, I actually had a good relationship with John. We disagreed on some things and some methods, but I actually had a good relationship.\u201d No one from the White House or the National Security Council would say on the record whether anyone else in the building refused to surrender control of Mr. Bolton\u2019s account or why. But an administration official who insisted on anonymity denied that the White House blocked him from gaining access to his account and said it would not know how to do that.",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 \u201cIn my line of work, perhaps in your line of work as well, all we have is our reputation,\u201d Marie L. Yovanovitch, the ousted American ambassador to Ukraine, said on Friday. \u201cThis has been a very painful period.\u201d It was just after 9 a.m. and the career diplomat and self-declared \u201cprivate person\u201d found herself engulfed in a ritual camera burst. She had entered the hearing room by a side door, as if she could avoid a fuss. After a career of far-flung postings and a diplomat\u2019s ease for sizing up exotic cultures, her mission before the House Intelligence Committee still resembled that of a wayward stopover in a strange land. Known as Masha, Ms. Yovanovitch, 61, looked every bit the outsider in a dangerous village. She walked to her seat with a story to tell. She exited nearly seven hours later \u2014 after a presidential tweet denigrating her drew gasps from the audience \u2014 to applause. Ms. Yovanovitch started with some basic housekeeping, the kind you could easily skip past in a less suspicious time. \u201cI come before you as an American citizen,\u201d she said in her opening statement. She also came as a human story, a witness to collateral damage \u2014 namely her own. Ms. Yovanovitch would be the first to assert there is nothing spectacular about her 33 years at State. She was but one of many unsung Foreign Service officials who toiled with distinction on behalf of the country. \u201cLike my colleagues, I entered the Foreign Service understanding that my job was to implement the foreign policy interests of this nation,\u201d she said. \u201cI had no agenda other than to pursue our stated foreign policy goals.\u201d President Barack Obama gave her Ukraine in 2016, where she would become the highest-ranking female ambassador at the State Department. By nearly all accounts she served with professionalism and a commitment to anti-corruption. Then along came Mr. Trump. The president, by way of his personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, targeted Ms. Yovanovitch as an impediment to the investigations they were trying to advance in Ukraine at the expense of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son Hunter \u2014 the events leading Mr. Trump to the brink of impeachment. Ms. Yovanovitch was disdained by Mr. Trump\u2019s allies as an Obama-appointed stooge (Don Jr. called her a \u201cjoker\u201d). She was accused without proof of disparaging the president and said she was warned (by Ukraine\u2019s interior minister) to \u201cwatch her back.\u201d When, according to her closed-door testimony, she asked the Trump-appointed ambassador to the European Union, Gordon D. Sondland, how she might improve her crippled standing in Washington, he suggested she tweet something nice about the president. Not normal. After being derided as \u201cbad news\u201d by Mr. Trump in a fateful July phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, Mr. Trump said ominously that \u201cshe\u2019s going to go through some things.\u201d Friday was quite a thing. \u201cI was shocked and appalled,\u201d the former ambassador said when she learned that Mr. Trump had disparaged her to the Ukrainian president. \u201cThe woman,\u201d Mr. Trump told Mr. Zelensky, \u201cwas bad news.\u201d \u201cThe woman.\u201d \u201cIt was a terrible moment,\u201d Ms. Yovanovitch said of her reaction. She quoted a person who observed her at the moment she learned of the president\u2019s characterization of her: \u201cThe color drained from my face.\u201d Although she presented as someone who was not easily flustered, she said that this was difficult to discuss, even months later. The room fell silent as Ms. Yovanovitch paused. For a moment it seemed that she might tear up, as a few spectators did in the back of the hearing room. Dan Goldman, the majority counsel, invited her to continue, hopefully \u201cwithout upsetting you too much.\u2019\u2019 Ms. Yovanovitch then spoke of her disbelief that an American president would talk like this to a foreign head of state about his own diplomat. And not just any diplomat. \u201cIt was me,\u201d she said, her voice creeping off, as she appeared to relive her shock. And then the president tweeted. About the witness. As she testified, in real time, a little after 10 a.m. It is safe to assume this was another first. \u201cEverywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad,\u201d came the president\u2019s just-discharged words. Representative Adam B. Schiff, the California Democrat who is chairman of the intelligence committee, jumped in to narrate the breaking tweet: \u201cShe started off in Somalia, how did that go?\u201d There were head shakes and maybe a grimace or two from even the staunchest Republicans on the panel. This was not your parents\u2019 impeachment (Clinton) or grandparents\u2019 (Nixon). Perhaps it should not have been a surprise, but the ambassador appeared freshly shaken. \u201cI don\u2019t think I have that power,\u201d she said after Mr. Schiff asked about the president blaming her for \u201cturning bad\u201d every place that she served. \u201cI made things better,\u201d she countered, less with conviction than disbelief. \u201cIt\u2019s very intimidating,\u201d she said a minute later, of what it was like to have the president of the United States denounce your entire career by tweet and learn about it, along with millions of other people, on live television. She rocked slowly in her chair. As the hearing wore on, Republicans repeatedly disparaged the proceeding as a \u201cperformance.\u201d Representative Devin Nunes, the ranking Republican from California, called it a \u201cshow trial.\u201d He predicted \u201clow ratings,\u201d the ultimate nod to the Audience of One in the White House. But Ms. Yovanovitch did not seem eager to perform. \u201cI really don\u2019t want to get into that but thank you for asking,\u201d Ms. Yovanovitch said after Representative Terri A. Sewell, Democrat of Alabama, asked how this experience has affected her family. There were some Republicans on the panel who seemed compelled to bolster the witness, especially after the president\u2019s tweet. They thanked her for her service. Her ordeal made her no less a public servant, patriot or vital part of the nation\u2019s foreign policy machinery, they said. They made clear, with a few exceptions, that their beef was with Democrats, not with her. As the inquiry neared its close, the process devolved into shouting. Members yelled back and forth, interrupting each other, trading objections and points of order. Mr. Schiff wielded his gavel like a jackhammer. Representative K. Michael Conaway, Republican of Texas, kept insisting to be recognized, complaining of \u201cdisparaging remarks\u201d made against his party. Finally, Mr. Conaway\u2019s microphone was shut off, and the men lingered, jawing inaudibly at each other before they walked off. Evidently pleased to leave the theatrics to the professionals, Ms. Yovanovitch allowed herself a tiny smile, like an anthropologist amused by the spectacle of wrestling bears. She walked off to a partial standing ovation from the gallery \u2014 also not normal. She had been \u201cthrough some things,\u201d for sure.",

      "author": "Emily Cochrane",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 As the deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia, Laura K. Cooper was one of multiple Pentagon officials who warned the White House that freezing congressionally approved aid to Ukraine could violate the law. Ms. Cooper, as well as other officials, repeatedly voiced concern that withholding the aid for a sustained period of time could run afoul of the Impoundment Control Act, which prevents the president from unilaterally deciding against spending money allocated by lawmakers. She also personally fielded two separate phone calls from alarmed Ukrainian diplomats quietly seeking information about the delay. The security assistance to Ukraine \u2014 a total of nearly $400 million \u2014 and the timing of its delay is at the heart of the impeachment investigation into whether President Trump abused the power of his office to enlist a foreign government for help in an election. When she testifies Wednesday before the House Intelligence Committee, Ms. Cooper, a career Defense Department official, is expected to provide some insight into efforts to persuade the Trump administration to release the aid. After a mid-June meeting with Mr. Trump, nearly a month before the aid was frozen, the administration began asking Ms. Cooper detailed questions about the money, she told House investigators last month in a closed-door interview. Those questions appeared prompted in part by an announcement from her office that the Pentagon planned to provide $250 million to Ukraine for training and equipment. In her closed-door testimony, Ms. Cooper offered details into the White House\u2019s reluctance to allow the funds to reach Ukraine. The administration, she told investigators, wanted to know which government agencies provided the funding, which American industries were involved in the aid and which other countries were contributing to Ukraine. \u201cWe got a question from my chain of command forwarded down from the chief of staff, I believe, from the Department of Defense, asking for follow-up on a meeting with the president,\u201d Ms. Cooper said. \u201cIt said, \u2018Follow-up from POTUS meeting,\u2019 so follow-up from a meeting with the president. So, you know, I\u2019m thinking that the questions were probably questions from the president.\u201d Her testimony underscored the divide in the administration between efforts to ensure the aid reached Ukraine and Mr. Trump\u2019s focus on the conditions of providing that aid. Other witnesses have testified that the president hoped to use the aid as leverage to ensure that the new Ukrainian administration opened investigations into his political rivals, including former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. Ms. Cooper\u2019s first appearance before House investigators last month was derailed for hours after a group of House Republicans barged into the secure room in the Capitol basement where closed-door depositions were being held. But ultimately, Ms. Cooper \u2014\u00a0who testified despite White House orders to ignore a subpoena \u2014 offered a technical, if narrow, account of the aid\u2019s suspension. Ms. Cooper, a St. Louis native and graduate of Georgetown University, National Defense University and Northwestern University, first worked as a policy planning officer in the State Department. She then moved to the Defense Department in 2001. Her portfolio now includes policy related to Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia, as well as the western Balkans.",

      "author": "The New York Times",
      "content": " Kurt D. Volker, Mr. Trump\u2019s former special envoy to Ukraine, appeared in front of the House Intelligence Committee on the third day of public impeachment hearings on Tuesday. Mr. Volker, who abruptly resigned one day after the release of the whistle-blower complaint, said, \u201cAt no time was I aware of or knowingly took part in an effort to urge Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Biden.\u201d The following is Mr. Volker\u2019s opening statement, as prepared for delivery and released by the House Intelligence Committee. Thank you very much for the opportunity to provide this testimony today. As you know, I was the first person to come forward to testify as part of this Inquiry. I did so voluntarily, and likewise voluntarily provided relevant documentation in my possession, in order to be as cooperative, clear and complete as possible. I am here today voluntarily, and I remain committed to cooperating fully and truthfully with this committee. All I can do is provide the facts as I understood them at the time. I did this on Oct. 3 in private, and I will do so again today. Like many others who have testified in this inquiry, I am a career foreign policy professional. I began my career as an intelligence analyst for Northern Europe for the Central Intelligence Agency in 1986, before joining the State Department in 1988. I served in diplomatic postings, primarily focused on European political and security issues, for over 20 years, under Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama. My last three positions before leaving the Senior Foreign Service in 2009 were as director for NATO and West European affairs at the National Security Council, principal deputy assistant secretary of state for European affairs at the State Department, and, finally, as U.S. ambassador to NATO. In the spring of 2017, then-Secretary of State Tillerson asked if I would come back to government service as U.S. special representative for Ukraine negotiations. I did this on a part-time, voluntary basis, with no salary paid by the U.S. taxpayer, simply because I believed it was important to serve our country in this way. I believed I could steer U.S. policy in the right direction. For over two years, as U.S. special representative for Ukraine negotiations, my singular focus was advancing the foreign policy and national security interests of the United States. In particular, that meant pushing back on Russian aggression and supporting the development of a strong, resilient, democratic and prosperous Ukraine \u2014 one that overcomes a legacy of corruption and becomes integrated into a wider trans-Atlantic community. This is critically important for U.S. national security. If we can stop and reverse Russian aggression in Ukraine, we can prevent it elsewhere. If Ukraine, the cradle of Slavic civilization predating Moscow, succeeds as a freedom-loving, prosperous and secure democracy, it gives us enormous hope that Russia may one day change \u2014 providing a better life for Russian people, and overcoming its current plague of authoritarianism, corruption, aggression toward neighbors and threats to NATO allies and the United States. The stakes for the United States in a successful Ukraine could not be higher. At no time was I aware of or knowingly took part in an effort to urge Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Biden. As you know from the extensive, real-time documentation I have provided, Vice President Biden was not a topic of our discussions. I was not on the July 25 phone call between President Trump and President Zelensky. I was not made aware of any reference to Vice President Biden or his son by President Trump, until the transcript of that call was released on Sept. 25, 2019. From July 7, 2017 until Sept. 27, 2019, I was the lead U.S. diplomat dealing with Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine. My role was not some irregular channel, but the official channel. I reported directly to Secretaries of State Tillerson and Pompeo, kept the national security adviser and secretary of defense well informed of my efforts, and worked closely with Ambassador Masha Yovanovitch, N.S.C. Senior Director Fiona Hill and her successor, Tim Morrison, then-Assistant Secretary Wess Mitchell and his successor, Acting Assistant Secretary Philip Reeker, Deputy Assistant Secretary George Kent, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Laura Cooper, N.S.C. Director Alex Vindman and many, many others. I have known many of them for several years. It was a team effort. When Ambassador Yovanovitch left Kyiv, I identified and recommended Bill Taylor to Secretary Pompeo, so we would still have a strong, seasoned professional on the ground. For two years before the events at the heart of this investigation took place, I was the most senior U.S. diplomat visiting the conflict zone; meeting with victims of Russia\u2019s aggression; urging increased U.S. security assistance, including lethal defensive weapons; working with Ukrainian President Poroshenko and then his successor, President Zelensky, and their teams; working with France and Germany and the so-called Normandy Process, pressing for support from NATO, the E.U., and O.S.C.E.; supporting the O.S.C.E.\u2019s special monitoring mission; and engaging in negotiations and other contacts with Russian officials. At the time I took the position in the summer of 2017, there were major, complicated questions swirling in public debate about the direction of U.S. policy toward Ukraine. Would the administration lift sanctions against Russia? Would it make some kind of \u201cgrand bargain\u201d with Russia, in which it would trade recognition of Russia\u2019s seizure of Ukrainian territory for some other deal in Syria or elsewhere? Would the administration recognize Russia\u2019s claimed annexation of Crimea? Will this just become another frozen conflict? There were also a vast number of vacancies in key diplomatic positions, so no one was really representing the United States in the negotiating process about ending the war in eastern Ukraine. During over two years of my tenure as U.S. special representative, we fundamentally turned U.S. policy around. U.S. policy toward Ukraine was strong, consistent and enjoyed support across the administration, bipartisan support in Congress and support among our allies and Ukraine. In short, whereas two years ago, most observers would have said that time is on Russia\u2019s side, by September of 2019, when I departed, we had turned the tables, and time was now on Ukraine\u2019s side. It is a tragedy for the United States and for Ukraine that our efforts in this area, which were bearing fruit, have now been thrown into disarray. One of the critical aspects of my role as U.S. special representative was that as the most senior U.S. official appointed to work solely on the Ukraine portfolio, I needed to step forward to provide leadership. If we needed to adopt a policy position, I made the case for it. If anyone needed to speak out publicly, I would do it. When we failed to get a timely statement about Russia\u2019s illegal attack on Ukraine\u2019s navy and seizure of Ukraine\u2019s sailors, I tweeted about it in order to condemn the act. If a problem arose, I knew that it was my job to try to fix it. That was my perspective when I learned in May 2019 that we had a significant problem that was impeding our ability to strengthen our support for Ukraine\u2019s new president in his effort to ramp up Ukraine\u2019s fight against corruption and implementation of needed reforms. I found myself faced with a choice: to be aware of a problem and to ignore it, or to accept that it was my responsibility to try to fix it. I tried to fix it. The problem was that despite the unanimous, positive assessment and recommendations of those of us who were part of the U.S. presidential delegation that attended the inauguration of President Zelensky, President Trump was receiving a different, negative narrative about Ukraine and President Zelensky. That negative narrative was fueled by accusations from Ukraine\u2019s then-prosecutor general and conveyed to the president by former Mayor Rudy Giuliani. As I previously told this committee, I became aware of the negative impact this was having on our policy efforts when four of us, who were part of the presidential delegation to the inauguration, met as a group with President Trump on May 23. We stressed our finding that President Zelensky represented the best chance for getting Ukraine out of the mire of corruption it had been in for over 20 years. We urged him to invite President Zelensky to the White House. The president was very skeptical. Given Ukraine\u2019s history of corruption, that is understandable. He said that Ukraine was a corrupt country, full of terrible people. He said they \u201ctried to take me down.\u201d In the course of that conversation, he referenced conversations with Mayor Giuliani. It was clear to me that despite the positive news and recommendations being conveyed by this official delegation about the new president, President Trump had a deeply rooted negative view on Ukraine rooted in the past. He was clearly receiving other information from other sources, including Mayor Giuliani, that was more negative, causing him to retain this negative view. Within a few days, on May 29, President Trump indeed signed the congratulatory letter to President Zelensky, which included an invitation to the president to visit him at the White House. However, more than four weeks passed and we could not nail down a date for the meeting. I came to believe that the president\u2019s long-held negative view toward Ukraine was causing hesitation in actually scheduling the meeting, much as we had seen in our Oval Office discussion. After weeks of reassuring the Ukrainians that it was just a scheduling issue, I decided to tell President Zelensky that we had a problem with the information reaching President Trump from Mayor Giuliani. I did so in a bilateral meeting at a conference on Ukrainian economic reform in Toronto, on July 2, 2019, where I led the U.S. delegation. I suggested that he call President Trump directly in order to renew their personal relationship, and to assure President Trump that he was committed to investigating and fighting corruption, things on which President Zelensky had based his presidential campaign. I was convinced that getting the two presidents to talk with each other would overcome the negative perception of Ukraine that President Trump still harbored. President Zelensky\u2019s senior aide, Andrey Yermak, approached me several days later to ask to be connected to Mayor Giuliani. I agreed to make that connection. I did so because I understood that the new Ukrainian leadership wanted to convince those, like Mayor Giuliani, who believed such a negative narrative about Ukraine, that times have changed and that, under President Zelensky, Ukraine is worthy of U.S. support. The Ukrainians believed that if they could get their own narrative across in a way that convinced Mayor Giuliani that they were serious about fighting corruption and advancing reform, Mayor Giuliani would convey that assessment to President Trump, thus correcting the previous, negative narrative. That made sense to me and I tried to be helpful. I made clear to the Ukrainians that Mayor Giuliani was a private citizen, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, and not representing the U.S. government. Likewise, in my conversations with Mayor Giuliani, I never considered him to be speaking on the president\u2019s behalf, or giving \u201cinstructions.\u201d Rather, the information flow was the other way \u2014 from Ukraine to Mayor Giuliani, in the hopes this would clear up the information reaching President Trump. On July 10, after hearing from Mr. Yermak, I wrote to Mayor Giuliani to seek to get together, and finally on July 19 we met for breakfast for a longer discussion. At that meeting, I told Mr. Giuliani that in my view, the prosecutor general with whom he had been speaking, Mr. Lutsenko, was not credible and was acting in a self-serving capacity. To my surprise, Mr. Giuliani said that he had already come to the same conclusion. Mr. Giuliani also mentioned both the accusations about Vice President Biden and about interference in the 2016 election, and stressed that all he wanted to see was for Ukraine to investigate what happened in the past and apply its own laws. Concerning the allegations, I stressed that no one in the new team governing Ukraine had anything to do with anything that may have happened in 2016. They were making television shows at the time. I also said that it is not credible to me that former Vice President Biden would have been influenced in any way by financial or personal motives in carrying out his duties as vice president. A different issue is whether some individual Ukrainians may have attempted to influence the 2016 election or thought they could buy influence: That is at least plausible, given Ukraine\u2019s reputation for corruption. But the accusation that Vice President Biden acted inappropriately did not seem at all credible to me. After that meeting, I connected Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Yermak by text and later by phone. They met in person on Aug. 2, 2019. In conversations with me following their meeting, which I did not attend, Mr. Giuliani said that he had stressed the importance of Ukraine conducting investigations into what happened in the past, and Mr. Yermak stressed that he told Mr. Giuliani it is the government\u2019s program to root out corruption and implement reforms, and they would be conducting investigations as part of this process anyway. Mr. Giuliani said he believed the Ukrainian president needed to make a statement about fighting corruption, and that he had discussed this with Mr. Yermak. I said that I did not think this would be a problem, since that is the government\u2019s position anyway. I followed up with Mr. Yermak, and he said that they would indeed be prepared to make a statement. He said it would reference Burisma and 2016, in a wider context of bilateral relations and rooting out corruption anyway. There was no mention of Vice President Biden. Rather, in referencing Burisma and 2016 election interference, it was clear to me he was only talking about whether any Ukrainians had acted inappropriately. At this time, I was focused on our goal of getting President Zelensky and President Trump to meet with each other, and I believed that their doing so would overcome the chronically negative view President Trump had toward Ukraine. I was seeking to solve the problem I saw when we met with President Trump in the Oval Office on May 23. As a professional diplomat, I was comfortable exploring whether there was a statement Ukraine could make about its own intentions to investigate possible corruption that would be helpful in convincing Mr. Giuliani to convey to President Trump a more positive assessment of the new leadership in Ukraine. On Aug. 16, Mr. Yermak shared a draft with me, which I thought looked perfectly reasonable. It did not mention Burisma or 2016 elections, but was generic. Ambassador Sondland and I had a further conversation with Mr. Giuliani, who said that in his view, in order to be convincing that this government represented real change in Ukraine, the statement should include specific reference to \u201cBurisma\u201d and \u201c2016.\u201d Again, there was no mention of Vice President Biden in these conversations. Ambassador Sondland and I discussed these points, and I edited the statement drafted by Mr. Yermak to include these points to see how it looked. I then discussed it further with Mr. Yermak. He said that for a number of reasons \u2014 including the fact that Mr. Lutsenko was still officially the prosecutor general \u2014 they did not want to mention Burisma or 2016. I agreed \u2014 and the idea of putting out a statement was shelved. These were the last conversations I had about this statement, which were on or about Aug. 17-18. My last contact with Mr. Giuliani, according to my records, was on Aug. 13 (until he tried to reach me on Sept. 20 after the impeachment inquiry was launched). At this time, I thought the idea of issuing this statement had been definitely scrapped. In September, I was surprised to learn that there had been further discussions with the Ukrainians about President Zelensky possibly making a statement in an interview with U.S. media similar to what we had discussed in August. Since these events, and since I gave my testimony on Oct. 3, a great deal of additional information and perspectives have come to light. I have learned many things that I did not know at the time of the events in question. First, at the time I was connecting Mr. Yermak and Mr. Giuliani, and discussing with Mr. Yermak and Ambassador Sondland a possible statement that could be made by the Ukrainian president, I did not know of any linkage between the hold on security assistance and Ukraine pursuing investigations. No one had ever said that to me \u2014 and I never conveyed such a linkage to the Ukrainians. Third, I did not understand that others believed that any investigation of the Ukrainian company, Burisma, which had a history of accusations of corruption, was tantamount to investigating Vice President Biden. I drew a sharp distinction between the two. Fifth, I was not aware that Ambassador Sondland spoke with President Trump on July 26, while Ambassador Taylor and I were visiting the conflict zone. Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, allow me to thank you again for the opportunity to provide this testimony. I believe that U.S. foreign policy and national security interests in Ukraine are of critical importance. I would be pleased to answer your questions.",

      "author": "Katie Benner",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Attorney General William P. Barr on Friday vigorously defended President Trump\u2019s use of executive authority and suggested that House Democrats were subverting the will of voters by exploring whether to remove the president from office for abusing his power. Mr. Trump campaigned on a vow to upend Washington, and voters were aware of his agenda when they elected him president, Mr. Barr said. \u201cWhile the president has certainly thrown out the traditional Beltway playbook and punctilio, he was up front about what he wanted to do and the people decided they wanted him to serve as president,\u201d Mr. Barr said in a speech at a conference hosted by the Federalist Society, a conservative legal group influential in Republican politics. Mr. Trump\u2019s opponents \u201cessentially see themselves as engaged in a war to cripple by any means necessary a duly elected government,\u201d Mr. Barr added. His forceful defense of the president came after some of Mr. Trump\u2019s allies have in recent weeks accused Mr. Barr of failing to vociferously back the president. Mr. Trump was said to be frustrated that Mr. Barr urged him to release a reconstructed transcript of the July call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine at the center of the impeachment case. The president also wanted Mr. Barr to hold a news conference to say the president had violated no laws, only to have Mr. Barr rebuff the request. Mr. Trump has denied that account. Speaking for an hour at the upscale Mayflower Hotel a few blocks from the White House, Mr. Barr hit back at the president\u2019s critics on an array of fronts as he argued that Mr. Trump, in his capacity as president, has not overstepped his authority. While Mr. Barr never uttered the word impeachment, he castigated those he sees as stalling Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda. He defended the president\u2019s right to set policies, steer the country\u2019s diplomatic and military relations and keep executive branch conversations confidential from congressional oversight. \u201cIn waging a scorched-earth, no-holds-barred war against this administration, it is the left that is engaged in shredding norms and undermining the rule of law,\u201d Mr. Barr said. He noted that opponents labeled themselves \u201cthe resistance\u201d immediately after Mr. Trump was elected and accused them of \u201cusing every tool and maneuver to sabotage the functioning of the executive branch and his administration. \u201cResistance is the language used to describe insurgency against rule imposed by an occupying military power,\u201d Mr. Barr said. He added that it connotes that the government is not legitimate. \u201cThis is a very dangerous and indeed incendiary notion.\u201d Mr. Barr spoke as the second public impeachment hearing wrapped up on Capitol Hill, where Democrats have accused Mr. Trump of abusing the power of his office for personal gain. Marie L. Yovanovitch, the former ambassador to Ukraine, testified that she was the target of a smear campaign engineered to get Mr. Trump to remove her; she was recalled from Kiev in the spring. She said that her dismissal from the post put national security at risk by opening the door for Russia to further influence Ukraine, a strategic American ally. She also said that she felt devastated and threatened to learn that Mr. Trump had vilified her to Mr. Zelensky, testimony that Mr. Trump underscored by attacking her on Twitter as she sat before lawmakers. In his address, Mr. Barr suggested the president has acted within his powers and that his opponents were willing to bend the law to stop him. Mr. Barr is known as an executive power maximalist and a believer in the unitary executive theory, which posits that the Constitution imbues the presidency with broad powers that are subject to relatively little oversight. He has argued, for example, that Congress cannot make it a crime for a president to exercise executive powers corruptly; and that presidents have authority over law enforcement investigations even when investigators are scrutinizing their activity. On Friday, Mr. Barr hit back against criticisms of his view of executive authority. \u201cSome of you may recall when I was up for confirmation, all these Democratic senators saying how concerned they were about my adherence to the unitary executive theory,\u201d Mr. Barr said. \u201cThis is not new and it\u2019s not a theory,\u201d Mr. Barr said, calling his viewpoint a straightforward description of the powers that the Constitution gives the president. \u201cWhatever the executive power may be, those powers must be exercised under the president\u2019s supervision,\u201d he said. Mr. Barr\u2019s assessment was a \u201chighly contestable \u2014 and in my view, seriously mistaken \u2014 reading of history,\u201d said Peter M. Shane, a former Justice Department official and Ohio State University law professor who specializes in the separation of powers. \u201cHe over-reads the vesting of executive power, ignores the limitations on executive power implicit in other clauses, and ignores evidence of what voters in favor of ratification would have expected from the text,\u201d Mr. Shane said. \u201cHe is, indeed, a maximalist.\u201d",

      "author": "Jim Tankersley",
      "content": " The United States economy is slowing and wage growth has slipped, but household incomes are rising and the unemployment rate is at a half-century low. This is the complicated \u2014 and somewhat contradictory \u2014 state of the American economy that President Trump painted over with a big smiley face at the Economic Club of New York on Tuesday. In remarks and a question-and-answer session, Mr. Trump continued to portray himself as a savior of what had been a moribund economy, trumpeting job gains and increased worker pay on his watch. To support his claims, he unleashed a flurry of economic statistics. Some were accurate, some were misleading and some appear nowhere close to the truth. Here are some of the president\u2019s claims. The United States is a member of the World Trade Organization, which adjudicates disputes between nations in global trade. Mr. Trump claimed that before he took office, the organization never ruled in favor of America in those disputes: \u201cThey would rule against us because they said: \u2018Hey, don\u2019t worry about the United States. They are the stupid people. Don\u2019t worry. Rule against them.\u2019\u201d The World Trade Organization\u2019s history of decisions shows this to be untrue. The United States usually prevails in cases that it brings before the global body. As Chad Bown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics explained: The unemployment rate has fallen to half-century lows in recent years. It was 3.6 percent in October \u2014 matching the lowest rate since 1969. So that\u2019s actually 50 years. The president was off by a year, but broadly correct about the historic nature of the low rate. Here, Mr. Trump is off by a lot. The Labor Department shows that, through October, the United States has added 443,000 manufacturing jobs since Mr. Trump took office. His number is off by more than 25 percent. Mr. Trump slightly overstated the number of manufacturing establishments lost under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama: It was about 55,000, according to the Labor Department, and would have been worse if the sector had not begun to rebound in 2013. Mr. Trump is correct that since he took office, the United States has added more than 10,000 new manufacturing establishments, as measured by the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages. They are mostly small businesses. Nearly all of those establishments \u2014 more than 9,000 \u2014 employ zero to five workers, the statistics show. In his zeal to praise his daughter, Ivanka Trump, who is co-chairwoman of a White House initiative to improve work force training, Mr. Trump claimed that she had \u201ccreated\u201d 14 million jobs. She has not. What Ms. Trump has done is help lead an effort that has resulted in private companies pledging to give \u201cover 12 million new education and training opportunities for American students and workers over the next five years,\u201d the White House says. That\u2019s not the same thing as creating jobs.",

Stone Jr. blatantly obstructed a congressional investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election because the truth \u201cwould look really bad\u201d for Mr. Trump. In closing arguments in Mr. Stone\u2019s obstruction of justice trial, prosecutors argued that he concealed reams of evidence, threatened a fragile witness and told \u201cwhoppers\u201d that impeded a House committee\u2019s investigation into how Russia used WikiLeaks to sabotage the 2016 presidential race. \u201cHe knew that if the truth came out about what he was doing in 2016, it would look terrible,\u201d Jonathan Kravis, an assistant United States attorney, told the jurors on the sixth day of Mr. Stone\u2019s trial on charges of deceiving the House Intelligence Committee two years ago. \u201cRoger Stone knew that if this information came out it would look really bad for his longtime associate Donald Trump.\u201d Bruce S. Rogow, Mr. Stone\u2019s defense lawyer, countered that the entire premise of the prosecution\u2019s case was false because Mr. Stone had no evidence that would have hurt Mr. Trump, or embarrassed his campaign. \u201cThat is a nonstarter,\u201d he said. \u201cIt makes no sense.\u201d Not only was Mr. Trump by then president and concerned with weightier matters when Mr. Stone testified before lawmakers in September 2017, Mr. Rogow said, but his campaign a year earlier had merely expressed a natural interest in what WikiLeaks might have in store for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump\u2019s Democratic opponent. \u201cThere was nothing malignant, nothing corrupt\u201d about the conduct of Mr. Stone or the campaign, he said. Mr. Stone\u2019s trial in a federal courthouse in Washington has unfolded against the backdrop of the impeachment inquiry into the president underway blocks away on Capitol Hill. As Congress grapples with allegations that Mr. Trump tried to pressure Ukraine to help his 2020 re-election effort, the Stone case has revived the story of how Russian operatives stole tens of thousands of Democratic emails and funneled them to WikiLeaks, which released them at critical points in the 2016 campaign. Jury deliberations will begin on Thursday, said Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who is overseeing the trial. Mr. Stone is charged with seven felonies that together carry a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison, though a defendant with no criminal history, like Mr. Stone, would almost certainly receive a far lighter punishment if he were found guilty on any counts. Prosecutors have said Mr. Stone hid dozens of text messages and emails that were pertinent to the House committee\u2019s inquiry; deliberately misidentified the person he dispatched to get in touch with the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in late summer 2016; covered up the fact that he tried to obtain stolen Democratic emails from WikiLeaks; and denied that he talked to Trump campaign officials about WikiLeaks\u2019 plans. Two former senior campaign officials, Rick Gates and Stephen K. Bannon, testified that they and other aides talked to Mr. Stone because he appeared to have inside information from WikiLeaks. Mr. Gates also recounted a July 2016 phone call between Mr. Trump and Mr. Stone, days after WikiLeaks released a trove of documents. As soon as they hung up, Mr. Trump said to Mr. Gates that more information would be coming out. According to the prosecutors, Mr. Stone falsely named Randy Credico, a New York radio host, as his go-between with WikiLeaks in July and August 2016. In fact, they said, he was relying on an author and conspiracy theorist named Jerome Corsi. Mr. Stone also falsely told the committee that he merely tried to confirm that WikiLeaks had emails that would prove damaging to Mrs. Clinton, and insisted he had no electronic communications with Mr. Credico, the prosecutors said. Records introduced as evidence show the two men exchanged more than 1,500 electronic messages from June to September 2017, including 72 texts on Sept. 26, the day of his testimony. Despite his promises to cooperate, \u201cRoger Stone has no intention of telling the committee the truth,\u201d Mr. Kravis argued. \u201cHe is just making stuff up.\u201d He said that Mr. Stone was now relying on sophistry to try to explain why he was not truthful, claiming that he confined his answers to publicly declared parameters of the committee\u2019s inquiry. \u201cThat is not how this works,\u201d Mr. Kravis said. \u201cRoger Stone does not get to pick and choose which facts he thinks are important and then lie about the rest of them.\u201d He also argued that Mr. Stone pressured Mr. Credico not to testify to the House committee because Mr. Credico was \u201cthe one guy out there who can knock down this whole house of cards.\u201d In the end, the radio host asserted his Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination and declined to cooperate. Mr. Rogow asked jurors to consider obvious holes in the prosecution\u2019s case, including why Mr. Corsi, who was supposedly Mr. Stone\u2019s true intermediary with WikiLeaks, was never called to testify. He also cast Mr. Credico, a key witness for the prosecution, as a perennial liar. \u201cThese two guys tampered with one another for 20 years over all kinds of crazy things,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was crude, it was odious\u201d \u2014 but, he said, it was not criminal. Mr. Stone\u2019s lawyers appeared to struggle throughout the trial to present a strong defense. Judge Jackson repeatedly summoned Mr. Rogow to the bench to correct missteps, interrupting him even during his closing argument. The defense rested its case after playing an audio tape of about 50 minutes of Mr. Stone\u2019s congressional testimony, calling no witnesses.",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was admitted to Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore on Friday night after experiencing chills and fever earlier in the day, a Supreme Court spokeswoman said on Saturday. Justice Ginsburg was initially evaluated at Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington before being transferred to Johns Hopkins for further evaluation and treatment of any possible infection, the spokeswoman, Kathleen Arberg, said in a statement. Justice Ginsburg\u2019s symptoms abated after treatment with intravenous antibiotics and fluids, Ms. Arberg said, adding the justice expected to be released from the hospital as early as Sunday morning. Justice Ginsburg, 86, has had a series of health scares lately, including surgery for lung cancer and radiation treatment for pancreatic cancer in the last year. Over the years, Justice Ginsburg has also had surgery for early-stage pancreatic cancer in 2009 and treatment for colon cancer in 1999. She missed oral arguments on Nov. 13, which she seldom does, because of what Ms. Arberg said was a stomach bug. Justice Ginsburg is the senior member of the court\u2019s four-member liberal wing. She has repeatedly vowed to stay on the court as long as her health holds and she stays mentally sharp. President Trump has appointed two members of the Supreme Court, Justices Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh. The last president to appoint more than two justices in his first term was Richard M. Nixon, who put four on the court from 1969 to 1972. Those appointments spelled the end of the liberal court that had been led by Chief Justice Earl Warren and created a conservative majority that remains to this day. The current court is closely divided, with five Republican appointees and four Democratic ones. A third Trump appointee would not only make the balance more lopsided but would also almost certainly move the court\u2019s ideological center to the right. Justice Ginsburg was named to the court in 1993 by President Bill Clinton. She was the first Democratic appointment since 1967, when President Lyndon B. Johnson nominated Thurgood Marshall. Justice Ginsburg was born in Brooklyn in 1933, graduated from Cornell in 1954 and began law school at Harvard. After moving to New York with her husband, she transferred to Columbia, where she earned her law degree. She taught at Columbia and Rutgers and was a leading courtroom advocate of women\u2019s rights before joining the court. As director of the Women\u2019s Rights Project of the American Civil Liberties Union in the 1970s, she brought a series of cases before the court that helped establish constitutional protections against sex discrimination. Her litigation strategy invited comparison to that of Justice Marshall, who was the architect of the civil rights movement\u2019s incremental legal attack on racial discrimination before he joined the court. During the Obama administration, some liberals urged Justice Ginsburg to step down so that President Barack Obama could name her successor. She rejected the advice. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be another Democratic president,\u201d Justice Ginsburg told The Washington Post in 2013. \u201cThe Democrats do fine in presidential elections; their problem is they can\u2019t get out the vote in the midterm elections.\u201d President Trump, whose election proved her wrong, has been critical of Justice Ginsburg, saying in 2016 that \u201cher mind is shot\u201d and suggesting that she resign. His sharp words came after Justice Ginsburg criticized Mr. Trump in a series of interviews. She later said she had made a mistake in publicly commenting on a candidate and promised to be more \u201ccircumspect\u201d in the future.",

      "author": "Linda Qiu",
      "content": " President Trump and his supporters have tried out a variety of talking points defending his attempts to press the Ukrainian government to open investigations that would benefit him politically. As the public phase of the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry begins on Wednesday, here are some of the most common rationales Republicans are putting forward to argue Mr. Trump\u2019s actions are not impeachable, and how they stack up against the facts. Mr. Trump himself is the most vocal proponent of this shoot-the-messenger defense. He has falsely claimed at least two dozen times that the whistle-blower complaint that spurred the impeachment inquiry was \u201cinaccurate,\u201d \u201cfalse\u201d or \u201ca lie.\u201d In fact, the White House released a reconstructed transcript of the president\u2019s phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine that corroborated much of what the whistle-blower reported. Witness testimony has also backed up and fleshed out the whistle-blower\u2019s main points. Mr. Trump has also accused Mark Zaid, a lawyer for the whistle-blower, of planning to \u201coverthrow\u201d the president, pointing to a 2017 Twitter post as proof. In the tweet, Mr. Zaid said a \u201ccoup\u201d had started and impeachment would follow, in reaction to Mr. Trump firing Sally Q. Yates as acting attorney general. (Mr. Zaid told The Times last week that his tweet was taken out of context and that he had also represented the Republican National Committee.) The whistle-blower cannot be trusted, according to Mr. Trump, because he or she is a \u201cstrong Democrat.\u201d While Michael Atkinson, the inspector general for the intelligence community, has said the whistle-blower showed \u201carguable political bias\u201d in favor of a rival candidate, that did not alter Mr. Atkinson\u2019s conclusion that the complaint was credible. Mr. Trump has also branded several officials who have testified before Congress as \u201cNever Trumpers.\u201d Speaking about Gordon D. Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union, who donated $1 million to the president\u2019s inauguration committee, Mr. Trump said this month that \u201cI hardly know the gentleman\u201d \u2014 despite having called Mr. Sondland \u201ca really good man and great American\u201d and \u201chighly respected\u201d last month. For weeks, Mr. Trump and his allies have aimed to hammer home this simple defense: there was no quid pro quo linking American military aid to Ukraine with investigations the president sought into the son of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., a leading Democratic presidential candidate, and the conspiracy theory that it was Ukraine, not Russia, that hacked the Democratic National Committee in 2016. This talking point was undercut by Mick Mulvaney, Mr. Trump\u2019s acting chief of staff, when he acknowledged a tie between the aid and the investigations in an October news conference and then retracted his statement the same day. Democrats have also seized upon four words uttered by Mr. Trump in the White House\u2019s reconstructed transcript of the call \u2014 \u201cdo us a favor\u201d \u2014 to argue that an exchange of benefits was clearly established. As an addendum, Mr. Trump has repeatedly cited Mr. Zelensky\u2019s denial that he felt pressured as evidence of their \u201cperfect call.\u201d William B. Taylor Jr., the top American diplomat in Ukraine, suggested otherwise when he testified to Congress that a national security adviser to Mr. Zelensky told him that the Ukrainian president \u201cdid not want to be used as a pawn in a U.S. re-election campaign.\u201d This argument \u2014 that Ukraine had been unaware that military aid had been withheld so it was impossible that Mr. Trump had conditioned its release on Ukraine opening certain investigations \u2014 has been employed by several Republican lawmakers as well as Donald Trump Jr., the president\u2019s eldest son, with varying degrees of accuracy. \u201cFirst of all, because nothing was withheld. The other guy on the other side actually said, \u2018I have no idea what you\u2019re talking about.\u2019 No one knew any aid was even being withheld,\u201d the younger Mr. Trump said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThe View\u201d last week. \u201cThe president was pressuring for investigation but there was no quo. The Ukrainian leader did nothing different to actually get the aid,\u201d Representative Don Bacon of Nebraska said in late October. Representative John Ratcliffe of Texas focused on the timing of the president\u2019s call with Mr. Zelensky. \u201cNeither Zelensky or any Ukrainian was aware there was a hold on military aid on July 25,\u201d Mr. Ratcliffe said last month, adding that \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter\u201d that the Ukrainians learned about it later. First, it\u2019s not true that \u201cnothing was withheld.\u201d The White House disclosed on July 18 in a secure call with national security officials that it was freezing the aid, and did not release it until Sept. 11, after coming under bipartisan pressure from Congress. Mr. Zelensky may have been unaware that of the aid freeze during the July 25 call, but his top aides had learned that Mr. Trump was seeking the investigations before the phone conversation. Mr. Taylor and two others \u2014 Fiona Hill, Mr. Trump\u2019s former top Russia adviser, and Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman, the top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council \u2014 have all testified that in a July 10 meeting with top Ukrainian officials, Mr. Sondland said that securing an Oval Office meeting between the two presidents would require a commitment from Ukraine to pursue the investigations. The New York Times has reported that some Ukrainian officials had learned of the aid freeze by the first week of August, and the whistle-blower\u2019s account said he had heard as of \u201cearly August\u201d that some Ukrainian officials were aware the aid might be in jeopardy. Mr. Zelensky has said he raised the issue with Vice President Mike Pence in a Sept. 1 meeting. According to Mr. Taylor, Mr. Sondland told a top aide to Mr. Zelensky that the \u201csecurity assistance money would not come\u201d until Kiev committed to pursuing the investigation into Mr. Biden\u2019s son. (This was also corroborated by Mr. Sondland.) It\u2019s also not true that Mr. Zelensky \u201cdid nothing different\u201d in an attempt to release the aid. He had agreed to appear on CNN on Sept. 13 and announce the investigations Mr. Trump had sought; that ultimately did not happen, but only because the White House released the aid. Allies of Mr. Trump have brushed aside the testimonies of Mr. Taylor and Mr. Sondland as mere speculation, not proof. Their argument is that there is no justification for impeachment \u201cbased on somebody saying they presumed and someone else saying they interpreted,\u201d Kellyanne Conway, the White House counselor, said last week. \u201cBill Taylor\u2019s presumption of the president\u2019s involvement or whatever came from a media story,\u201d Representative Doug Collins, Republican of Georgia, said last Wednesday on Fox News. \u201cHe pointed to Mr. Giuliani, he didn\u2019t point to the president.\u201d That media story was a New York Times report in May that detailed efforts by Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, to press Ukraine into investigating Mr. Biden\u2019s son and the theory that origin of the special counsel inquiry into Russia\u2019s interference in 2016. Mr. Giuliani told The Times\u2019s Kenneth P. Vogel that Mr. Trump supported his actions and \u201cbasically knows what I\u2019m doing, sure, as his lawyer\u201d \u2014 contradicting the suggestion that Mr. Trump was unaware. \u201cSondland\u2019s actions were based on Sondland\u2019s assumptions,\u201d Representative Mike Johnson of Louisiana, said last Wednesday on CNN. \u201cThere are many assumptions about a lot of what he said and that was based on his ideas about what was happening, not necessarily about what the president said.\u201d Mr. Sondland, in his revised testimony, did say that he \u201cpresumed that the aid suspension had become linked to the proposed anti-corruption statement.\u201d But he also noted that he believed the Ukrainian president needed to make a public pledge that he was beginning certain investigations before a White House visit would be granted \u2014 a condition, he said, that was communicated by Mr. Giuliani at Mr. Trump\u2019s direction. The most explicit example of this line of argument comes from Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky. \u201cMenendez tried it. Murphy tried it. Biden tried it. Trump\u2019s tried it. They\u2019re all doing it. They are all trying to manipulate Ukraine to get some kind of investigation, either to end an investigation or start an investigation,\u201d Mr. Paul said on Sunday on NBC. In May 2018, Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey and two other Democrats wrote a letter to Yuriy Lutsenko, then Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general, expressing concerns that Mr. Lutsenko\u2019s office had frozen investigations related to the special counsel investigation led by Robert S. Mueller III because officials were wary of offending Mr. Trump. The letter made no explicit mention of aid. Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, met with Mr. Zelensky in September as part of a bipartisan delegation. The Times reported that Mr. Murphy \u201csaid he urged Mr. Zelensky not to heed the requests from Mr. Giuliani, warning that to do so could threaten bipartisan support for Ukraine in Washington.\u201d Mr. Murphy later described his comments as a \u201ccommon sense\u201d caution against interfering in the 2020 election. As vice president, Mr. Biden had called for the dismissal of Viktor Shokin, who became prosecutor general of Ukraine in 2015, and Mr. Biden threatened to withhold assistance from the United States until Mr. Shokin was pushed out. But Mr. Biden\u2019s actions were in line with United States foreign policy as well as the stated positions of Senate Republicans, European Union leaders and the International Monetary Fund, all of whom were calling for Mr. Shokin\u2019s ouster. Some Republicans have not gone so far as to completely absolve Mr. Trump, but argue that his actions do not rise to the level of an impeachable offense. \u201cI believe that it is inappropriate for a president to ask a foreign leader to investigate a political rival,\u201d Representative Mac Thornberry of Texas said on Sunday. \u201cI do not believe it was impeachable.\u201d \u201cI think if you\u2019re trying to get information on a political rival to use in a political campaign is not something a president or any official should be doing,\u201d Representative Will Hurd of Texas said on Fox News Sunday. \u201cI believe that\u2019s something that would make it \u2014 have to truly consider whether impeachment is the right tool or not.\u201d",

      "author": "Dave Philipps",
      "content": " President Trump cleared three members of the armed services on Friday who have been accused or convicted of war crimes, overruling military leaders who had sought to punish them. All three have been championed by conservative lawmakers and commentators, who have portrayed them as war heroes unfairly prosecuted for actions taken in the heat and confusion of battle. In a statement released by the White House late Friday, Mr. Trump announced that he was ordering the full pardon of Clint Lorance, a former Army lieutenant, from the military prison at Fort Leavenworth, where he is serving a 19-year sentence for the murder of two civilians. He ordered the full pardon of Maj. Mathew L. Golsteyn, an Army Special Forces officer who was facing murder charges for killing an unarmed Afghan he believed was a Taliban bomb maker. And he reversed the demotion of Chief Petty Officer Edward Gallagher, a Navy SEAL who was acquitted of murder charges but convicted of a lesser offense in a high-profile war crimes case over the summer. \u201cThe President, as Commander-in-Chief, is ultimately responsible for ensuring that the law is enforced and when appropriate, that mercy is granted,\u201d the White House statement said. \u201cAs the President has stated, \u2018when our soldiers have to fight for our country, I want to give them the confidence to fight.\u2019\u201d The moves signaled that as commander in chief, Mr. Trump intends to use his power as the ultimate arbiter of military justice in ways unlike any other president in modern times. Top military leaders have pushed back hard against clearing the three men. Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy have argued that such a move would undermine the military code of justice, and would serve as a bad example to other troops in the field, administration officials said. Mr. Trump\u2019s actions were first reported by The Washington Post. They were previewed last week on the Fox News show \u201cFox & Friends\u201d by one of the hosts, Pete Hegseth, who said he had spoken to the president and described him as having \u201cfidelity to the war fighter.\u201d \u201cThe president looks at it through that lens, a simple one, and important one,\u201d Mr. Hegseth said, adding, \u201cThe benefit of the doubt should go to the guys pulling the trigger.\u201d A Navy official said SEAL leaders first learned of the plans from the Fox News broadcast, and since then have lobbied against clearing Chief Gallagher. The three men have been portrayed in conservative media outlets and social media posts as dedicated warriors battling enemies who wear no uniforms and follow no laws of war, only to be unfairly second-guessed by military lawyers and commanders far from the scene of battle. Mr. Trump echoed their frustration on Twitter in October, saying about Major Golsteyn, \u201cWe train our boys to be killing machines, then prosecute them when they kill!\u201d Experts were unable to name any other recent case of a member of the American armed forces receiving a presidential pardon for a violent crime committed in uniform, except for one granted by Mr. Trump in May. And it was strikingly unusual, they said, to clear a soldier of murder charges before the case is tried. \u201cI\u2019m not sure it\u2019s ever been done,\u201d said Gary Solis, a retired military judge who served as an armor officer in Vietnam. Referring to the only soldier convicted in the gruesome My Lai Massacre of civilians during the Vietnam War, Mr. Solis said: \u201cPeople think Nixon pardoned Lieutenant Calley, but he didn\u2019t. Calley was paroled.\u201d Presidents all the way back to George Washington have granted pardons to tens of thousands of American troops, but nearly all were young men who deserted or who evaded a draft, and received clemency after the fighting ended. While the new pardons are a stark departure from tradition, they are in line with Mr. Trump\u2019s many statements during his campaign and in office, arguing that to beat unconventional enemies like the Taliban and ISIS, the American military should loosen the reins on how troops behave in conflict zones. \u201cYou have to play the game the way they are playing the game,\u201d he told NBC News in 2016. The specific circumstances of the three men\u2019s cases defy easy characterization. In one, a decorated captain admitted to a killing in a job interview. In the other two, platoon leaders\u2019 illegal actions were reported not by superior officers or Pentagon lawyers, but by their own platoons. Troops who testified in those two cases, against Lieutenant Lorance and Chief Gallagher, voiced disappointment and disbelief over Mr. Trump\u2019s plans for clemency before they were announced. \u201cThe tragedy of pardoning Lorance isn\u2019t that he will be released from prison \u2014 I\u2019ve found room for compassion there,\u201d said Patrick Swanson, a former Army captain who was Lieutenant Lorance\u2019s company commander in Afghanistan. \u201cThe tragedy is that people will hail him as a hero, and he is not a hero. He ordered those murders. He lied about them.\u201d Mr. Lorance was a rookie Army lieutenant who had been in command of a platoon in Afghanistan for two days in July 2012 when he ordered his troops to fire on unarmed villagers who posed no threat, killing two men. He then called in false reports over the radio to cover up what had happened. He was immediately turned in by his own men. Mr. Lorance, whose story is the subject of a new documentary series, was convicted of second-degree murder by a court-martial in 2013, and he has been in prison since then, serving his sentence at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas. Major Golsteyn was charged in 2018 with premeditated murder over a killing that took place in 2010, when he was a captain in the Army Special Forces leading a team during Operation Moshtarak, one of the biggest combat operations of the war in Afghanistan. He admitted in a job interview with the C.I.A. the following year that, during the battle, he had killed a suspected bomb maker who had been captured and released, saying he had done so to protect civilians and his own men. An initial Army investigation resulted in a reprimand but no charges. However, after Major Golsteyn publicly admitted the killing during a 2016 interview on Fox News, the Army reopened the case and charged him with premeditated murder. Chief Gallagher was charged by the Navy in 2018 with shooting civilians in Iraq, killing a captive enemy fighter with a hunting knife, and threatening to kill fellow SEALs if they reported him, among other crimes. The charges stemmed from a 2017 deployment in Iraq when he was a chief petty officer leading a SEAL platoon. After a tumultuous trial, he was acquitted by a military jury in July of all charges except one minor count: bringing discredit on the armed forces, by posing for a photo with the corpse of the captive he was accused of killing. Though Chief Gallagher could have been demoted to the lowest rank in the service as a result, the top admiral in the Navy decided in October to demote him by just one step, to petty officer first class. Mr. Trump had already intervened in the Gallagher case, ordering him moved to less restrictive confinement to await trial, and has posted supportive messages on Twitter. The Gallagher family has repeatedly urged the president in social media posts to step in again. \u201cGiven his service to our Nation, a promotion back to the rank and pay grade of Chief Petty Officer is justified,\u201d the White House statement said. The Navy had been planning additional punishment for Chief Gallagher. Timothy Parlatore, one of Chief Gallagher\u2019s lawyers, said the chief was told to appear before SEAL commanders on Nov. 1 at Naval Base Coronado near San Diego so they could remove his Trident pin, signifying that they were officially kicking him out of the SEAL teams. Navy leaders also planned to take away the Tridents of three officers who knew of the platoon\u2019s allegations against Chief Gallagher but did not report them. But Chief Gallagher waited all day at the base while commanders sought approval for the action from top Navy officials and the White House, which never came, according to a Navy official briefed on the meeting. Plans to punish all four of the SEALs are now on hold, the official said. Mr. Parlatore welcomed the president\u2019s intervention. \u201cIt shows leadership,\u201d he said, because SEAL commanders had become \u201cso blinded by their unhealthy fixation on Eddie Gallagher, and it was time for an adult in the room to stand up and say, \u2018Enough.\u2019\u201d The White House initially made preparations to issue more pardons on Memorial Day but held off after encountering fierce resistance from military leaders and prominent veterans. Among them was a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin Dempsey, who wrote on Twitter: \u201cAbsent evidence of innocence or injustice the wholesale pardon of US servicemembers accused of war crimes signals our troops and allies that we don\u2019t take the Law of Armed Conflict seriously. Bad message. Bad precedent. Abdication of moral responsibility. Risk to us.\u201d The men cleared by the president offered thanks Friday. On his Instagram account, Chief Gallagher, who a year ago had been facing the prospect of life in prison, thanked his family and thousands of supporters, and praised the president. \u201cI truly believe that we are blessed as a Nation to have a Commander-in-Chief that stands up for our warfighters, and cares about how they and their families are treated,\u201d he wrote. \u201cOur military is the best in the world, and with steadfast and supportive leadership; like we have in this president, our fighting force will only get stronger.\u201d",

SangerPRINT EDITIONFor President,  Case of Policy Vs. Obsession|November 15, 2019, Page A1",
      "author": "David E. Sanger",
      "content": " The last two impeachment investigations of the past half-century began with a third-rate burglary and an extramarital affair. They quickly expanded to question the credibility and ethics of the president, but never touched on America\u2019s national interests in the weightiest geopolitical confrontations of their eras. The sober, just-the-facts testimony of two previously little-known diplomats on Wednesday left no doubt that the investigation into President Trump\u2019s actions is fundamentally different. Mr. Trump had a choice between executing his administration\u2019s own strategy for containing Russia or pursuing a political obsession at home. He chose the obsession. In an otherwise divided Washington, one of the few issues of bipartisan agreement for the past six years has been countering the Russian president Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s broad plan of disruption. That effort starts in Ukraine, where a hot war has been underway in the east for five years, and a cyberwar underway in the capital, Kiev. It is exactly that policy that Mr. Trump appears to have been discarding when he made clear, in the haunting words attributed to Gordon D. Sondland, who parlayed political donations into the ambassadorship to the European Union, that \u201cPresident Trump cares more about the investigation of Biden\u201d than about Ukraine\u2019s confrontation with Mr. Putin\u2019s forces. It was perhaps the most telling, and to some the most damning, line of the torrent of revelations in the past two months \u2014 the distillation of an internal argument inside the Trump administration that the president\u2019s closest aides have endeavored to keep hidden. That single line, relayed by William B. Taylor Jr., the avuncular, experienced diplomat sent back to Kiev in May by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, encapsulated the now obvious truth that Mr. Trump had little interest in the central national security strategy that his own administration published in late 2017. That strategy ostensibly reoriented American diplomacy from an 18-year focus on counterterrorism to a new approach to the world\u2019s two \u201crevisionist powers,\u201d Russia and China. Each poses very different challenges to the United States. Mr. Taylor, a veteran \u2014 first of Vietnam and then of the Cold War and its messy aftermath \u2014 has devoted much of his career to building fragile democracies from the ruins of the Soviet Union. Those who know him say they do not know his politics. So it was no surprise when he cautioned the committee that he had no desire to take part in impeachment proceedings. \u201cI am not here to take one side or the other or to advocate for any particular outcome of these proceedings,\u201d he said, a line that brought visible skepticism from those on the committee who believe he epitomizes the diplomatic \u201cdeep state.\u201d Instead, Mr. Taylor, who served as ambassador to Ukraine under the George W. Bush administration, portrayed himself as a \u201cfact witness\u201d who had just returned from the Donbas, the eastern area of Ukraine where 14,000 people have already died. But his facts led him to a pretty politically charged conclusion. \u201cI think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\u201d Mr. Taylor said. When pressed what he meant, Mr. Taylor added that because \u201cthat security assistance was so important for Ukraine as well as our own national interests, to withhold that assistance for no good reason other than help with a political campaign made no sense.\u201d \u201cIt was counterproductive to all of what we had been trying to do,\u201d he added. \u201cIt was illogical. It could not be explained. It was crazy.\u201d The issue is explained away by Mr. Taylor\u2019s superiors in the State Department and the White House, who argue that the story of withheld aid is a political concoction. Ultimately, the funds were released. It was like paying your credit bill on the last day possible \u2014 in this case, the deadline was the end of the government\u2019s fiscal year on Sept. 30. No real harm, no impeachable foul, they contend, and did not President Barack Obama decline to provide the Ukrainians with Javelin antitank missiles? One of Mr. Trump\u2019s senior advisers noted that Washington\u2019s press corps was not writing several years ago that Mr. Obama was, in this official's words, leaving Ukrainians to die. In contrast, Mr. Trump offered them the Javelins. (Mr. Trump\u2019s sale of those weapons prohibited the use of Javelins on the front lines, in an effort to cast them as deterrent weapons.) But from where Mr. Taylor was sitting in Kiev, withholding the aid hardly seemed harmless. The power of his testimony lay in how starkly he laid out what amounted to an extortion scheme: that Mr. Trump was personally refusing to release the funds unless Ukraine\u2019s new president, Volodymyr Zelensky, publicly announced two investigations. One was into Burisma, the energy company in which the son of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. had taken a board seat and payments of as much as $50,000 a month. The other was an investigation into a completely discredited theory that Ukrainian hackers, not Russia\u2019s military intelligence unit, may have been responsible for the 2016 breach of the Democratic National Committee. If that was true, the Justice Department might have to consider withdrawing its indictment of a dozen Russian intelligence officials for masterminding and executing one of the boldest hackings in American political history. The indictment was issued last year by Jeff Sessions, who was then serving as attorney general. Of the many odd twists in the partisan noise around the impeachment, Mr. Trump\u2019s effort to divert attention from suspicions about the intrusion away from Russia \u2014 implicit in his July 25 telephone conversation with Mr. Zelensky \u2014 may be the oddest. Ukraine has been Mr. Putin\u2019s favorite cybertarget, the petri dish where the Russian leader has tried out many of the techniques he later turned on the United States, like influence operations,  tinkering with voter systems and riddling the electric grid with malware. As George P. Kent, the assistant secretary of state with responsibility for Ukraine, told the committee Wednesday, the funds appropriated by Congress, and withheld on Mr. Trump\u2019s orders, were meant \u201cto fight Russian aggression in the defense, energy, cyber and information spheres.\u201d It was clear from the testimony that Mr. Taylor and Mr. Kent have been pressing for \u2014 and carrying out \u2014 some version of that policy for several administrations, and deeply believe in it. But it has become more urgent. The annexation of Crimea in 2014 unified Republicans, Democrats and Western allies; they issued sanctions and threw Russia out of the Group of 8, where its presence had been intended to integrate the nation with Europe. When the Senate voted in 2017 to extend sanctions on Russia, the vote was 98 to 2; only Senators Rand Paul and Bernie Sanders voted against it. That veto-proof majority forced Mr. Trump to sign the legislation. Still, the evidence this pressure is working is scant. Be it Syria or Libya, or elsewhere in Africa and Eastern Europe, Russia has stepped up its actions, and here in the United States, the big question is whether the United States is prepared to stave off Russian interference in next year\u2019s presidential election. All this made tightening the alliance with Ukraine more important, as a signal, and as a deterrent. But Mr. Trump has never signed on to that strategy; the evidence now is that he sought to undercut it. In fact, it was an open secret in the White House that the president, who has little patience for long documents, never read the full national strategy published under his name, according to several of his former national security officials. He has never repeated its main tenets, particularly its references to Russia, in public; instead, he makes vague mention of how it would be a good thing if Russia and the United States got along. His actions, as opposed to his strategy documents, have been a quilt of contradictions. He has pulled out of treaties with the Russians \u2014 most recently the Intermediate Nuclear Forces treaty \u2014 and invested in a new nuclear arms race. But he has also questioned why the United States needs to keep up the sanctions imposed on Moscow after the annexation of Crimea and the attacks on Ukraine, and, by pulling back from Syria, he has ceded territory that Mr. Putin coveted. As it seeks to quash the impeachment parade, the State Department under Mr. Pompeo has added to the confusion by declining to answer questions about what happened this summer, as the aid was frozen. Mr. Pompeo himself has declined to be drawn into those discussions, saying simply that they are internal conversations that should be kept confidential. That is now over: Mr. Taylor\u2019s lengthy, calm recitation of each interaction over the summer with his colleagues back in Washington, based on his copious notes, gives a window into policymaking unmatched since the revelation in 2010 of the State Department\u2019s internal cables by WikiLeaks. But what Mr. Taylor\u2019s and Mr. Kent\u2019s accounts reveal is a department that was keeping its own diplomats in the dark. Mr. Taylor, sitting in the Kiev Embassy as a temporary successor to the mysteriously ousted Marie L. Yovanovitch, never received the formal notes from Mr. Trump\u2019s conversation with Mr. Zelensky. He only heard by accident that military aid was frozen. He said he did not figure out how that was related to Mr. Trump\u2019s demands until late in the summer. The Cold War, too, was filled with incomprehensible moments and quid pro quos. President John F. Kennedy struck the most famous, secretly trading a Russian nuclear presence in Cuba for the withdrawal of American nuclear weapons in Turkey. The details were kept secret for years. But both the quid and the quo were rooted in some plausible definition of American national interest. That is drastically different from what Mr. Trump sought: American military aid in return for dirt on his opponents.",

      "author": "Dave Philipps",
      "content": " Army First Lt. Clint Lorance on Friday changed out of the drab inmate\u2019s uniform he had worn for six years, and left the military prison at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas a free man. He arrived minutes later at a nearby hotel, where his family swallowed him in a group embrace, crying tears of joy. \u201cI want to say thank you to President Trump,\u201d he said amid a throng of well-wishers. \u201cAnd I want the rest of the country to do that, too.\u201d The president on Friday cleared Lieutenant Lorance and two other servicemen accused or convicted of war crimes, drawing cheers from thousands of supporters who said the men had been unfairly punished for decisions made in the confusion of war. But many in the military, especially in military legal circles, are not celebrating. Mr. Trump\u2019s reprieves, issued against the advice of top defense officials, were seen as a sign of disregard not only for the decisions of military juries, but for the judicial process itself. Military officials publicly accepted the president\u2019s orders \u2014 pardons for Maj. Matthew Golsteyn of the Army Special Forces and Lieutenant Lorance, and a sentence reduction for Chief Petty Officer Edward Gallagher of the Navy SEALs \u2014 with a terse yessir. \u201cWe acknowledge his order and are implementing it,\u201d the Navy chief of information said on Twitter. Privately, though, many worried that Mr. Trump\u2019s actions could erode discipline by sending a message to troops and commanders that in some cases the laws of war would not apply. \u201cIt\u2019s just institutionally harmful,\u201d said Rachel VanLandingham, a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel and former judge advocate who now teaches law at Southwestern Law School. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about these three individuals, it\u2019s about the whole military justice system and whether that system itself is something of value to the operations of the military.\u201d The president, she added, \u201cis saying he knows best.\u201d While all three men were accused of war crimes, the details of their cases raised disparate concerns for military order. Lieutenant Lorance was convicted at trial in 2013 for ordering the shooting of a group of civilians in Afghanistan, an order he then tried to cover up. He was given a full pardon. Chief Gallagher was charged with the murder of a captive in Iraq but was acquitted this summer of all charges except for the minor charge of posing for a photo with a corpse. Major Golsteyn was awaiting trial on charges that he murdered an unarmed Afghan in 2010. \u201cGolsteyn is the most troubling, because the system was never given a chance to work,\u201d said Charles Dunlap, a retired major general who was the deputy judge advocate general of the Air Force and is now the head of Duke University\u2019s Center on Law, Ethics and National Security. \u201cA court-martial is the best way to determine the facts,\u201d he added. \u201cWe were never able to find out whether the facts would clear Golsteyn or not.\u201d Many senior military leaders felt the pardons sent the wrong message, said Phillip Carter, an Iraq War veteran who researches military issues at the RAND Corporation. \u201cEver since Vietnam the leadership has sent a message that there is a link between discipline, respect for laws of war and military effectiveness,\u201d Mr. Carter said. \u201cThe pardons send a different message that sometimes the laws get in the way.\u201d Mr. Trump is not the first commander in chief to wield the power of clemency in a polarizing way. Washington pardoned men convicted of treason in the Whiskey Rebellion of 1791-94 despite howls of protest from other Federalists, said Mark Osler, a law professor at the University of St. Thomas in Minnesota. President Abraham Lincoln repeatedly pardoned soldiers sentenced to death for desertion, even though his generals warned it would undermine battlefield discipline. President Gerald Ford announced in 1974 at a convention of the Veterans of Foreign Wars that he planned to conditionally pardon 13,000 deserters and draft dodgers, which did not go over well with the audience of war veterans. His successor, Jimmy Carter, unconditionally pardoned hundreds of thousands of draft evaders. \u201cIt has happened after every war,\u201d Mr. Osler said. \u201cPardons are used as a way to forgive the crime and heal the nation. What is different now is, the signal here seems to be to embrace the crime, not forgive it. President Trump seems to be sending a message that the gloves are off, that we are not going to constrain our military.\u201d Reactions from combat veterans were split. Many thanked the president for intervening on behalf of men who had volunteered to serve and protect their country. Others said the gesture of forgiveness tarnished the service of troops who served in the same vexing conditions, but did not break the laws of war. \u201cThis is a sad day for the tens of thousands of us who led troops in combat in Iraq and Afghanistan who were proud of the way in which we maintained our good order and discipline in the face of many challenges,\u201d Andrew Exum, a former Army Special Forces officer who deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan, said on Twitter. \u201cThese men, now pardoned, remain a disgrace to our ranks.\u201d But for other veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan, the pardons only brought back grim memories of violence and a counterinsurgency doctrine that often blurred moral lines. Jorge Rodriguez was a Marine infantryman deployed to Afghanistan in 2008. Now a police officer in Texas, he remembered a day in southern Afghanistan when, as a lance corporal, his machine-gun team fired on two men fleeing a nearby village on a motorcycle \u2014 a village that commanders had said contained no civilians. Like uncounted killings in Iraq and Afghanistan, it was never reported as questionable, and never investigated. The bodies were left by the roadside 50 yards from his small outpost for weeks. They were young, Mr. Rodriguez said, and to this day he doesn\u2019t know if they were Taliban fighters or not. \u201cIt was war,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd people will never understand what they had asked us to do.\u201d",

      "author": "Danny Hakim",
      "content": " Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman is hitting back at the smear campaign against him. A lawyer for Colonel Vindman, the National Security Council\u2019s Ukraine expert, sent a warning letter to Fox News on Wednesday seeking a retraction or correction of an October segment hosted by one of the network\u2019s biggest personalities, Laura Ingraham, which baselessly suggested that the colonel, a decorated Iraq war veteran, might be guilty of espionage. The letter sent by David Pressman, a partner at Boies Schiller Flexner, the law firm run by David Boies, also highlighted inflammatory statements made on the network by others, including President Trump\u2019s son Donald Trump Jr., who has repeatedly attacked Colonel Vindman, and Tucker Carlson, another prominent Fox host. \u201cLTC Vindman and his family have been forced to examine options, including potentially moving onto a military base, in order to ensure their physical security in the face of threats rooted in the falsehood that Fox News originated,\u201d Mr. Pressman wrote in the letter. Mr. Pressman\u2019s letter mainly focused on an Oct. 28 segment of \u201cThe Ingraham Angle,\u201d a show hosted by Ms. Ingraham, featuring an exchange between her and John Yoo, who was a top lawyer in the George W. Bush administration. During their exchange, Ms. Ingraham said, \u201cHere we have a U.S. national security official who is advising Ukraine, while working inside the White House, apparently against the president\u2019s interest, and usually, they spoke in English. Isn\u2019t that kind of an interesting angle on this story?\u201d \u201cI found that astounding,\u201d Mr. Yoo replied. \u201cSome people might call that espionage.\u201d Espionage is a felony punishable by death, Mr. Pressman wrote, adding that before the Fox segment, Colonel Vindman \u201chad never in his decorated 20-year career of service to his country been accused of having dual loyalties or committing espionage.\u201d Colonel Vindman was not trying to silence the news media, Mr. Pressman wrote. \u201cHe wants, as any responsible news organization would want, to see the truth published,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Fox News is in a unique position to correct its falsehoods with truth.\u201d The segment \u201csparked a torrent of republications and copycat false charges,\u201d he added. A statement released Wednesday by Fox said that \u201cas a guest on Fox News, John Yoo was responsible for his own sentiments, and he has subsequently done interviews to clarify what he meant.\u201d In an opinion article in USA Today, under the headline, \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t call Alexander Vindman a spy,\u201d Mr. Yoo wrote that he was accusing Ukraine of conducting an espionage operation. \u201cDespite what might appear on twitter, I didn\u2019t say that Lt. Col. was a spy or that he had committed espionage,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cI had no reason to question that he was doing his duty as an officer. But I think the Ukrainians are engaged in espionage against us.\u201d Mr. Pressman, in his letter, wrote that \u201cMr. Yoo\u2019s argument that he did not intend to accuse LTC of Vindman of \u2018espionage\u2019 \u2014 that he was accusing the nation of Ukraine instead \u2014 is as legally irrelevant as it is factually incredible.\u201d Much of the right-wing criticism of Colonel Vindman accuses him of being partisan, despite his long career of nonpartisan military service, or that he has divided loyalties, since he immigrated from Ukraine when he was 3. The president himself has suggested that the colonel is a \u201cNever Trumper,\u201d without evidence. And critics like Ms. Ingraham have seized on the fact that he had high-level contacts with Ukrainian officials and provided guidance to them on American policy, even though a key part of his job at the National Security Council is to interact with the Ukrainian government and communicate security policy. The letter also said that Mr. Trump had \u201cbuilt on and amplified Fox News\u2019 falsehoods\u201d in his Twitter posts, and cited a segment in which Donald Trump Jr., referred to the colonel as \u201ca leftist,\u201d though a Fox News host interjected to say \u201cwe don\u2019t know if he\u2019s a leftist.\u201d In testimony on Tuesday before the House Intelligence Committee, Colonel Vindman said that he twice reported his concerns about the Trump administration\u2019s dealings with Ukraine to N.S.C. officials. At the hearing, Republicans ominously highlighted an episode where the Ukrainians sounded out the colonel about becoming the country\u2019s defense minister, an offer the colonel said he rejected immediately and reported to his supervisors. In the aftermath of his appearance, attacks against Colonel Vindman escalated, including from Donald Trump Jr., who called the colonel \u201ca low level partisan bureaucrat and nothing more.\u201d Mr. Carlson and Ms. Ingraham seized on Ukraine\u2019s job offer, with Mr. Carlson saying on-air, according to the letter, \u201cNow we learn that the Ukrainian government repeatedly asked Vindman to take formal control of the entire Ukrainian military, which, for the record, is a very strange thing to ask of an active duty American military officer.\u201d Mr. Pressman lamented such insinuations about his client\u2019s loyalty. \u201cNot once in his twenty-year career has LTC Vindman sought out the public eye,\u201d he wrote. \u201cLTC Vindman came into the public not because of his actions, but despite them.\u201d",

Giuliani was running his \u201cirregular channel\u201d of diplomacy over open cell lines and communications apps penetrated by the Russians.By David E. SangerPRINT EDITIONOpen Phones Made U.S. An Open Book to Russia|November 19, 2019, Page A20",
      "author": "David E. Sanger",
      "content": " Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York mayor at the center of the impeachment investigation into the conduct of Ukraine policy, makes a living selling cybersecurity advice through his companies. President Trump even named him the administration\u2019s first informal \u201ccybersecurity adviser.\u201d But inside the National Security Council, officials expressed wonderment that Mr. Giuliani was running his \u201cirregular channel\u201d of Ukraine diplomacy over open cell lines and communications apps in Ukraine that the Russians have deeply penetrated. In his testimony to the House impeachment inquiry, Tim Morrison, who is leaving as the National Security Council\u2019s head of Europe and Russia, recalled expressing astonishment to William B. Taylor Jr., who was sitting in as the chief American diplomat in Ukraine, that the leaders of the \u201cirregular channel\u201d seemed to have little concern about revealing their conversations to Moscow. \u201cHe and I discussed a lack of, shall we say, OPSEC, that much of Rudy\u2019s discussions were happening over an unclassified cellphone or, perhaps as bad, WhatsApp messages, and therefore you can only imagine who else knew about them,\u201d Mr. Morrison testified. OPSEC is the government\u2019s shorthand for operational security. He added: \u201cI remember being focused on the fact that there were text messages, the fact that Rudy was having all of these phone calls over unclassified media,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd I found that to be highly problematic and indicative of someone who didn\u2019t really understand how national security processes are run.\u201d WhatsApp notes that its traffic is encrypted, meaning that even if it is intercepted in transit, it is of little use \u2014 which is why intelligence agencies, including the Russians, are working diligently to get inside phones to read the messages after they are deciphered. But far less challenging is figuring out the message of Mr. Giuliani\u2019s partner, Gordon D. Sondland, the American ambassador to the European Union, who held an open cellphone conversation with Mr. Trump from a restaurant in Ukraine, apparently loud enough for his table mates to overhear. And Mr. Trump\u2019s own cellphone use has led American intelligence officials to conclude that the Chinese \u2014 with whom he is negotiating a huge trade deal, among other sensitive topics \u2014 are doubtless privy to the president\u2019s conversations. But Ukraine is a particularly acute case. It is the country where the Russians have so deeply compromised the communications network that in 2014 they posted on the internet conversations between a top Obama administration diplomat, Victoria Nuland, and the United States ambassador to Ukraine at the time, Geoffrey R. Pyatt. Their intent was to portray the Americans \u2014 not entirely inaccurately \u2014 as trying to manage the ouster of a corrupt, pro-Russian president of Ukraine. The incident made Ms. Nuland, who left the State Department soon after Mr. Trump\u2019s election, \u201cPatient Zero\u201d in the Russian information-warfare campaign against the United States, before Moscow\u2019s interference in the American presidential election. But it also served as a warning that if you go to Ukraine, stay off communications networks that Moscow wired. That advice would seem to apply especially to Mr. Giuliani, who speaks around the world on cybersecurity issues. Ukraine was the petri dish for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, the place where he practiced the art of trying to change vote counts, initiating information warfare and, in two celebrated incidents, turning out the lights in parts of the country. Mr. Giuliani, impeachment investigators were told, was Mr. Trump\u2019s interlocutor with the new Ukrainian government about opening investigations into the president\u2019s political opponents. The simultaneous suspension of $391 million in military aid to Ukraine, which some have testified was on Mr. Trump\u2019s orders, fulfilled Moscow\u2019s deepest wish at a moment of ground war in eastern Ukraine, and a daily, grinding cyberwar in the capital. It remains unknown why the Russians have not made any of these conversations public, assuming they possess them. But inside the intelligence agencies, the motives of Russian intelligence officers is a subject of heated speculation. A former senior American intelligence official speculated that one explanation is that Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Sondland were essentially doing the Russians\u2019 work for them. Holding up military aid \u2014 for whatever reason \u2014 assists the Russian \u201cgray war\u201d in eastern Ukraine and sows doubts in Kyiv, also known as Kiev in the Russian transliteration, that the United States is wholly supportive of Ukraine, a fear that many State Department and National Security Council officials have expressed in testimony. But Mr. Giuliani also was stoking an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory that Mr. Putin has engaged in, suggesting that someone besides Russia \u2014 in this telling, Ukrainian hackers who now supposedly possess a server that once belonged to the Democratic National Committee \u2014 was responsible for the hacking that ran from 2015 to 2016. Mr. Trump raised this possibility in his July 25 phone call with the new Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky. It was not the first time he had cast doubt on Russia\u2019s involvement: In a call to a New York Times reporter moments after meeting Mr. Putin for the first time in Hamburg, Germany, in 2017, Mr. Trump endorsed Mr. Putin\u2019s view that Russia is so good at cyberoperations that it would have never been caught. \u201cThat makes sense, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d he asked. He expressed doubts again in 2018, in a news conference with Mr. Putin in Helsinki, Finland. That was only days after the Justice Department indicted a dozen Russian intelligence officers for their role in the hack; the administration will not say if it now believes that indictment was flawed because there is evidence that Ukranians were responsible. Whether or not he believes Ukraine was involved, Mr. Giuliani certainly understood the risks of talking on open lines, particularly in a country with an active cyberwar. As a former prosecutor, he knows what the United States and its adversaries can intercept. In more recent years, he has spoken around the world on cybersecurity challenges. And as the president\u2019s lawyer, he was a clear target. Mr. Giuliani said in a phone interview Monday that nothing he talked about on the phone or in texts was classified. \u201cAll of my conversations, I can say uniformly, were on an unclassified basis,\u201d he said. His findings about what happened in Ukraine were \u201cgenerated from my own investigations\u201d and had nothing to do with the United States government, he said, until he was asked to talk with Kurt D. Volker, then the special envoy for Ukraine, in a conversation that is now part of the impeachment investigation. Mr. Volker will testify in public on Tuesday. Mr. Giuliani said that he never \u201cconducted a shadow foreign policy, I conducted a defense of my client,\u201d Mr. Trump. \u201cThe State Department apparatchiks are all upset that I intervened at all,\u201d he said, adding that he was the victim of \u201cwild accusations.\u201d Mr. Sondland is almost as complex a case. While he is new to diplomacy, he is the owner of a boutique set of hotels and certainly is not unaware of cybersecurity threats, since the hotel industry is a major target, as Marriott learned a year ago. But Mr. Sondland held a conversation with Mr. Trump last summer in a busy restaurant in Kyiv, surrounded by other American officials. Testimony indicates Mr. Trump\u2019s voice was loud enough for others at the table to hear. But in testimony released Monday night, David Holmes, a veteran Foreign Service officer who is posted to the American Embassy in Kyiv, and who witnessed the phone call between the president and Mr. Sondland, suggested that the Russians heard it even if they were not out on the town that night. Asked if there was a risk of the Russians listening in, Mr. Holmes said, \u201cI believe at least two of the three, if not all three of the mobile networks are owned by Russian companies, or have significant stakes in those.\u201d \u201cWe generally assume that mobile communications in Ukraine are being monitored,\u201d he said.",

      "author": "Peter Baker",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 As Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman sat in a stately chamber testifying on Tuesday, the White House posted on its official Twitter account a message denouncing his judgment. His fellow witness, Jennifer Williams, had barely left the room when the White House issued a statement challenging her credibility. In President Trump\u2019s Washington, where attacks on his enemies real or perceived have become so routine that they now often pass unnoticed, that might not seem all that remarkable \u2014 but for the fact that Colonel Vindman and Ms. Williams both still work for the very same White House that was publicly assailing them. With the president\u2019s allies joining in, the two aides found themselves condemned as nobodies, as plotting bureaucrats, as traitors within and, in Colonel Vindman\u2019s case, as an immigrant with dual loyalties. Even for a president who rarely spares the rhetorical howitzer, that represents a new level of bombardment. Mr. Trump has publicly disparaged cabinet secretaries, former aides and career officials working elsewhere in the government, but now he is taking aim at people still working for him inside the White House complex by name. \u201cThis White House appears to be cannibalizing itself,\u201d said William C. Inboden, a former national security aide to President George W. Bush. \u201cWhile many previous White House staffs have feuded with each other and leaked against each other, this is the first time in history I am aware of a White House openly attacking its own staff \u2014 especially for merely upholding their constitutional duties.\u201d In part, that reflects the challenge for a president facing an impeachment inquiry where every witness called so far either currently or previously worked in the government over which he presides. To defend against potential charges of high crimes and misdemeanors, Mr. Trump evidently feels he must undercut the believability of the witnesses testifying about his pressure campaign on Ukraine for help against his domestic rivals. It also reflects the president\u2019s longstanding distrust of the career professionals who populate his White House, just as they have every other. While such officials characterize their work as nonpartisan in service of presidents of either party, Mr. Trump has felt burned since the early days of his administration when internal documents were leaked, including transcripts of two of his phone calls with foreign leaders. \u201cNothing is the same anymore,\u201d said Ari Fleischer, a White House press secretary for Mr. Bush. \u201cClearly, when the staff leaks presidential phone calls with foreign leaders the first week of the president\u2019s job, the staff is not what the staff used to be. It taints everyone, even good and loyal staffers.\u201d All three witnesses who testified publicly last week still work for the State Department, and Mr. Trump directly denigrated one of them, Marie L. Yovanovitch, who was recalled as ambassador to Ukraine. But Colonel Vindman, the top Ukraine policy official on the National Security Council staff, and Ms. Williams, a national security aide to Vice President Mike Pence, were the first to appear before the House Intelligence Committee while still working in the White House. Even before raising his hand to take the oath on Tuesday, Colonel Vindman had come under particularly sharp fire. Mr. Trump\u2019s allies on Fox News and elsewhere have questioned his patriotism by noting that he was born in Ukraine, a critique the naturalized citizen rebutted by showing up Tuesday in his Army dress uniform with Combat Infantry Badge and a Purple Heart from his service in Iraq. Colonel Vindman opened his testimony by deploring smears on government officials who have been subpoenaed to testify in the inquiry. \u201cThe vile character attacks on these distinguished and honorable public servants is reprehensible,\u201d he said. Amid the threats, the Army has been assessing potential security threats to Colonel Vindman and his brother Yevgeny, who also works at the National Security Council. There have also been discussions about moving the Vindmans and their families onto a military base for their protection, according to a person with knowledge of the discussions. The committee\u2019s Republican counsel questioned Colonel Vindman on Tuesday about an offer from Ukraine\u2019s new government to become defense minister, a proposal he said he dismissed out of hand and reported to his superiors and counterintelligence officials. Fox News quickly picked up on the issue, sending out a news alert moments later: \u201cVindman says Ukrainian official offered him the job of Ukrainian defense minister.\u201d Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio, grilled Colonel Vindman about comments by two former bosses at the National Security Council, Tim Morrison and Fiona Hill, raising questions about his judgment. Colonel Vindman replied by pulling out a copy of a performance evaluation that Ms. Hill wrote in July and read it aloud. \u201cAlex is a top 1 percent military officer and the best Army officer I have worked with in my 15 years of government service,\u201d Colonel Vindman read. The White House nonetheless posted a Twitter message: \u201cTim Morrison, Alexander Vindman\u2019s former boss, testified in his deposition that he had concerns about Vindman\u2019s judgment.\u201d Speaking with reporters, Mr. Trump seemed to scorn Colonel Vindman for appearing in uniform. \u201cI never saw the man,\u201d the president said. \u201cI understand now he wears his uniform when goes in. No, I don\u2019t know Vindman at all.\u201d Democratic lawmakers responded angrily to attacks on Colonel Vindman. Representative Sean Patrick Maloney, Democrat of New York, accused Republicans of trying to \u201cair out some allegations with no basis and proof, but they just want to get them out there and hope maybe some of those strands of spaghetti I guess will stick on the wall if they keep throwing them.\u201d As for Ms. Williams, the president tweeted about her over the weekend. \u201cTell Jennifer Williams, whoever that is, to read BOTH transcripts of the presidential calls, & see the just released ststement from Ukraine,\u201d he wrote, misspelling \u201cstatement.\u201d \u201cThen she should meet with the other Never Trumpers, who I don\u2019t know & mostly never even heard of, & work out a better presidential attack!\u201d Ms. Williams, a career official who got her start under Mr. Bush and called former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice \u201ca personal hero of mine,\u201d denied that she was a \u201cNever Trumper.\u201d So did Colonel Vindman. \u201cI'd call myself Never Partisan,\u201d he said. Asked her reaction to the president\u2019s tweet, Ms. Williams said: \u201cIt certainly surprised me. I was not expecting to be called out by name.\u201d But she would be again before the day was out. Mr. Pence\u2019s two most senior aides pushed back against her after she testified that she considered Mr. Trump\u2019s July 25 telephone call with Ukraine\u2019s president \u201cunusual\u201d because of the president\u2019s request that the Kyiv government investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and other Democrats. \u201cI heard nothing wrong or improper on the call,\u201d retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, the vice president\u2019s national security adviser, said in a written statement released after her testimony. \u201cI had and have no concerns. Ms. Williams was also on the call, and as she testified, she never reported any personal or professional concerns to me, her direct supervisor, regarding the call. \u201cIn fact,\u201d he added, \u201cshe never reported any personal or professional concerns to any other member of the vice president\u2019s staff, including our chief of staff and the vice president.\u201d Marc Short, the vice president\u2019s chief of staff, went on Fox News to make the same point. \u201cShe said she found the call unusual, yet she never raised any concerns with her supervisor, General Kellogg, she never raised any concerns with the chief of staff, she never raised any concerns with the vice president,\u201d he said. He added, \u201cWe have impeachment in pursuit of a crime.\u201d Neither Ms. Williams nor Colonel Vindman weighed in on whether Mr. Trump should be impeached. As career officials, they generally stuck to factual accounts of their experiences and gave dispassionate though at times pointed assessments of what they saw while clearly trying to avoid being drawn into the larger political debate about what Congress should do about the situation. But they presumably will have to return to work at some point, back to the same White House complex where they have served knowing that the president they serve blames them for his political troubles. Charles A. Kupchan, who was President Barack Obama\u2019s Europe adviser, said it should come as no surprise that Colonel Vindman and Ms. Williams would be targeted from within. \u201cIt is quite unusual for a White House to eat its young,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Trump is a president who seems unable to tolerate dissent.\u201d Andrew Weiss, who was President Bill Clinton\u2019s Russia adviser, said the attacks on Colonel Vindman \u201cmust be incredibly demoralizing for career people\u201d still at the National Security Council. \u201cDuring my time at the N.S.C., there was a bright red line between national security and domestic politics,\u201d he said. \u201cUnder Trump, that line has completely disappeared.\u201d Even some more supportive of Mr. Trump suggested on Tuesday that he stop going after witnesses. \u201cThe president should just ignore this whole thing,\u201d Brian Kilmeade, a host on \u201cFox and Friends,\u201d one of Mr. Trump\u2019s favorite shows, said before the day\u2019s hearings got underway. \u201cDon\u2019t tweet during it. Don\u2019t get outraged over it. It ticks you off.\u201d That was advice the president did not take.",

      "content": "   WASHINGTON \u2014 Kurt D. Volker, the former special envoy to Ukraine, plans to tell lawmakers on Tuesday that he was out of the loop at key moments during President Trump\u2019s pressure campaign on Ukraine to turn up damaging information about Democrats, according to an account of his prepared testimony. As the House Intelligence Committee opens its second week of public impeachment hearings, Mr. Volker will say that he did not realize that others working for Mr. Trump were tying American security aid to a commitment to investigate Democrats. His testimony, summarized by a person informed about it who insisted on anonymity to describe it in advance, will seek to reconcile his previous closed-door description of events with conflicting versions offered subsequently by other witnesses. Mr. Volker will be one of four witnesses appearing before the committee on Tuesday as it ramps up its investigation into the president\u2019s effort to extract domestic political help from a foreign power while holding up $391 million in American security aid. The committee, which already had eight witnesses set for this week, added a ninth on Monday by calling David Holmes, a senior American Embassy official in Ukraine who overheard a conversation in which Mr. Trump asked about whether Ukraine was going to agree to carry out the investigations he wanted. Mr. Trump, who remained out of public sight on Monday for the third straight day, wrote on Twitter that he would \u201cstrongly consider\u201d testifying in the impeachment inquiry, after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi raised the idea during a weekend television interview. While Gerald R. Ford testified in 1974 about his decision to pardon Richard M. Nixon and Bill Clinton responded in writing to questions from the House when it investigated him for perjury and obstruction of justice in 1998, no president has testified in person in his own defense in an impeachment hearing. Mr. Trump, who enjoys flashes of showmanship, appeared intrigued by the possibility. \u201cEven though I did nothing wrong, and don\u2019t like giving credibility to this No Due Process Hoax, I like the idea & will, in order to get Congress focused again, strongly consider it!\u201d Mr. Trump wrote. That does not mean he will actually agree to do so, however. During the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, into ties between Russia and Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, the president repeatedly suggested he might testify in person, but ultimately refused to do so and instead submitted written answers drafted with the help of his lawyers. On Monday, the top lawyer for House Democrats said in a legal filing that impeachment investigators are exploring whether Mr. Trump lied in those written answers to Mr. Mueller. The addition of Mr. Holmes to the witness list follows a closed-door deposition he gave Friday describing a cellphone conversation he listened to in July. While sitting on the outdoor patio of a restaurant in Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital also known as Kiev, Mr. Holmes said he heard the president ask Gordon D. Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union, if President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine would move forward with the investigations Mr. Trump sought. Late Monday, the House Intelligence Committee released transcripts of the testimony of Mr. Holmes and David Hale, the under secretary of state for political affairs. Mr. Holmes called the cellphone conversation he overheard in Kyiv between the president and Mr. Sondland \u201cremarkable,\u201d and he testified that it was clear to him that officials in Ukraine \u201cgradually came to understand that they were being asked to do something in exchange for the meeting and the security assistance hold being lifted.\u201d His account underscored that, contrary to Mr. Trump\u2019s claim that Ukraine\u2019s leaders never knew American aid was being withheld, top officials there were well aware that it was, and that they had to do what the president wanted before they could receive it. Mr. Holmes gave a vivid account of the cellphone call between Mr. Trump and Mr. Sondland, and of a subsequent conversation in which the ambassador told Mr. Holmes that Mr. Trump did not care about  Ukraine, only about \u201cbig things,\u201d such as investigations of the Bidens. \u201cThere\u2019s just so much about the call that was so remarkable that I remember it vividly,\u201d Mr. Holmes said, according to the transcript. He said he recounted the conversation to his boss at the embassy after the lunch and said she was \u201cshocked\u201d by it. Mr. Holmes said that in morning embassy staff meetings, he would often refer back to the call as a way of trying to explain Mr. Trump\u2019s reluctance to schedule a White House meeting with Mr. Zelensky. \u201cI would say, \u2018Well, as we know, he doesn\u2019t really care about Ukraine. He cares about some other things,\u2019\u201d Mr. Holmes testified. Mr. Hale offered new details about deliberations within the State Department over the recall of Marie L. Yovanovitch as ambassador to Ukraine. By the end of March, he said the department was debating whether to issue a statement of support for her amid unrelenting attacks by Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, and others. In his testimony, Mr. Hale said that he had reviewed two call records indicating that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spoke directly with Mr. Giuliani on March 28 and 29. He did not know the content of the calls. He also believed that Mr. Pompeo had called Sean Hannity, the conservative Fox News commentator. Mr. Hale said that he advocated a strong statement of support, but that ultimately, no statement was issued because officials believed it would make things worse. \u201cOur plan at that point was to try to contain this and wait it out,\u201d he said. Mr. Hale is scheduled to testify publicly on Wednesday afternoon. Mr. Holmes will sit at the witness table beside Fiona Hill, the former senior director for Russia and Europe at the National Security Council, when the committee convenes its final hearing of a jam-packed week on Thursday. Republicans previewed an early rebuttal on Monday in the form of a meandering but at times caustic 11-page letter from Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin. On the eve of testimony by Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman, a national security aide, Mr. Johnson suggested the colonel perhaps participated \u201cin the ongoing effort to sabotage\u201d the president\u2019s policies \u201cand if possible, remove him from office.\u201d \u201cI believe that a significant number of bureaucrats and staff members within the executive branch have never accepted President Trump as legitimate and resent his unorthodox style,\u201d Mr. Johnson wrote, later adding, \u201cIt is entirely possible Vindman fits this profile.\u201d The letter comes after the top Republicans on the House Oversight and Intelligence Committees requested Mr. Johnson provide them with \u201cany firsthand information you have about President Trump\u2019s actions toward Ukraine.\u201d The Wisconsin Republican traveled to Ukraine as part of a delegation attending Mr. Zelensky\u2019s inauguration this year and joined phone calls between Mr. Trump and Mr. Sondland, who is to testify publicly on Wednesday. The senator has said that after Mr. Sondland told him the security aid was linked to investigations, he confronted Mr. Trump in a phone call in late August. The president, Mr. Johnson said, flatly denied it so vigorously that he uttered a number of curse words and insisted that he \u201cbarely knew\u201d Mr. Sondland. The hearings on Tuesday will start with a morning panel featuring Mr. Vindman and Jennifer Williams, an adviser to Vice President Mike Pence, who were both disturbed when Mr. Trump pressed Mr. Zelensky during a July 25 phone call to \u201cdo us a favor\u201d and investigate Democrats including former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. But the afternoon panel will give Republicans their first chance to question witnesses they believe will undercut the allegations. Mr. Volker has previously said he knew of no quid pro quo between the security aid and the investigations. Tim Morrison, a former senior director for Europe and Russia at the National Security Council, has said he found nothing inherently problematic about the July 25 call, although he testified that he was concerned that it might leak out and cause political problems. Still, both have also provided testimony harmful to the president. Mr. Volker has said he warned Mr. Giuliani that there was nothing to the issues he wanted investigated. And Mr. Morrison has said Mr. Sondland told the Ukrainians that the release of the aid was probably tied to the investigations, forcing Mr. Sondland to revise his testimony and confirm that. Mr. Volker will modify his account as well, addressing disparities between his testimony and that of other witnesses. While he has been lumped together with Mr. Sondland and Energy Secretary Rick Perry as \u201cthe three amigos\u201d working on behalf of the president, he plans to try to distinguish his role, insisting that he was not part of any inappropriate pressure and that he was unaware of certain events that he has only now learned about through other testimony. In his testimony on Tuesday, according to the person informed about it, Mr. Volker plans to say that he never knew that Mr. Sondland told the Ukrainians that the aid and investigations were linked and that he did not know that Mr. Zelensky was being pressed to appear on CNN and announce that he would open the investigations Mr. Trump sought. He also will seek to explain why his description of a key July 10 meeting in the White House with Ukrainian officials differed from those provided by several others. According to other witnesses, John R. Bolton, then the national security adviser, abruptly ended the meeting when Mr. Sondland raised the investigations. Mr. Sondland then took the Ukrainians downstairs to the White House Ward Room, where he also discussed investigations. Ms. Hill testified that she challenged Mr. Sondland about that in the Ward Room and later reported the conversation back to Mr. Bolton, who instructed her to tell a White House lawyer and make clear that he wanted nothing to do with the \u201cdrug deal\u201d Mr. Sondland was devising. Mr. Volker, who offered a blander description of the meeting in his original testimony, plans to say on Tuesday that he does not challenge any of the new testimony but did not remember hearing the comments. He plans to say that he may have been talking with Mr. Perry at the time and simply missed the exchanges. He also will address his past statement that he was not aware of any effort to urge Ukraine to investigate Mr. Biden specifically, even though others have testified that Mr. Volker was part of conversations involving Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company that had been investigated for corruption and that put Hunter Biden, the former vice president\u2019s son, on its board. Mr. Volker plans to tell lawmakers that while others interpreted any mention of Burisma to be synonymous with the Bidens, he did not make that assumption, perhaps because he was more steeped in Ukraine and the company\u2019s role there, not focused on domestic American politics.",

SchmidtPRINT EDITIONTrump Mulled Firing Official For Reporting Ukraine Call|November 13, 2019, Page A15",
      "author": "Maggie Haberman",
      "content": "  President Trump has discussed dismissing the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general, Michael Atkinson, because Mr. Atkinson reported a whistle-blower\u2019s complaint about Mr. Trump\u2019s interactions with Ukraine to Congress after concluding it was credible, according to four people familiar with the discussions. Mr. Trump first expressed his dismay about Mr. Atkinson around the time the whistle-blower\u2019s complaint became public in September. In recent weeks, he has continued to raise with aides the possibility of firing him, one of the people said. The president has said he does not understand why Mr. Atkinson shared the complaint, which outlined how Mr. Trump asked the Ukrainian president to investigate Mr. Trump\u2019s political rivals at the same time he was withholding military aid from the country. He has said he believes Mr. Atkinson, whom he appointed in 2017, has been disloyal, one of the people said. Mr. Trump\u2019s private complaints about Mr. Atkinson have come as he has publicly questioned his integrity and accused him of working with the Democrats to sabotage his presidency. It is unclear how far Mr. Trump\u2019s discussions about removing Mr. Atkinson have progressed. Two people familiar with what took place said they thought that Mr. Trump was just venting, and insisted that Mr. Atkinson\u2019s dismissal was never under serious consideration. But the mixture of public attacks and private discussions about a possible dismissal is a familiar way Mr. Trump has undermined investigators who have examined his conduct or that of people close to him. The president publicly criticized James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, and Jeff Sessions, the former attorney general, before he dismissed them for perceived disloyalty. Mr. Trump believes he has the power to fire anyone in the executive branch, though aides say they have learned to ignore many of his private rants, unless the president brings up the subject repeatedly and appears on the precipice of making a move they feel could be damaging. Spokesmen for the White House and inspector general\u2019s office declined to comment. Inspectors general are supposed to be insulated from politics so they can follow the facts and provide oversight of the executive branch. While presidents have the authority to remove them, they are supposed to take that action only in cases of misconduct or failure to fulfill duties. In 2009, President Barack Obama fired the inspector general of the Corporation for National and Community Service, which runs AmeriCorps, for what White House officials said was incompetence. Republicans and even some Democrats questioned the move, while conservative pundits held up the inspector general as a victim of Mr. Obama\u2019s politics. People close to the president believe the political consequences of firing Mr. Atkinson could be devastating, especially when Mr. Trump needs all the Republican support he can get for a potential impeachment trial in the Senate. Mr. Trump\u2019s decision in May 2017 to fire Mr. Comey, who was leading an investigation into ties between Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and Russia, set off a firestorm that led to the appointment of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. The following month, after it became public that Mr. Mueller was investigating Mr. Trump for obstructing justice, Mr. Trump told the White House counsel at the time, Donald F. McGahn II, to have Mr. Mueller removed. That incident later became a central episode in Mr. Mueller\u2019s report, and House Democrats are still considering using that incident in an article of impeachment on obstruction of justice. Mr. Atkinson\u2019s handling of the anonymous whistle-blower\u2019s complaint was a major factor in the decision by House Democrats to initiate an impeachment inquiry. After conducting an investigation that led him to believe the complaint was credible, he forwarded it to the government\u2019s top intelligence official, Joseph Maguire, who did not provide it to Congress in the time frame required under the law, but did allow Mr. Atkinson to alert lawmakers about the existence of the complaint. In early September, Mr. Atkinson told Congress that Mr. Maguire had refused to hand over the document. Under pressure from Democratic lawmakers, Mr. Maguire then gave the document to Congress. Mr. Maguire later acknowledged that he and his top lawyer had checked with the White House and Justice Department about whether he was permitted to turn the document over to Congress, saying that he was concerned that such an action could infringe on executive privilege issues. Lawyers for Mr. Maguire and the Justice Department said that because Mr. Trump was not a member of the intelligence community, Mr. Atkinson did not have the jurisdiction to deliver the report. Mr. Trump said in recent days that he believes Mr. Atkinson should be forced to testify at impeachment hearings the Democrats are scheduled to begin this week. \u201cI recommend that Nervous Nancy Pelosi (who backed up Schiff\u2019s lie), Shifty Adam Schiff, Sleepy Joe Biden, the Whistleblower (who miraculously disappeared after I released the transcript of the call), the 2nd Whistleblower (who also disappeared), & the I.G., be part of the list!\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted on Saturday, using the acronym for inspector general. Mr. Trump\u2019s public attacks on Mr. Atkinson have been part of his larger attempts to delegitimize the whistle-blower and the process that led to the disclosure of the complaint. In these efforts, Mr. Trump has tried to present himself as an advocate for whistle-blowers, falsely claiming that he had been behind legislation to protect them. \u201cTo think I signed the Whistleblower Protection Act!\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted on Monday, misstating what he had signed.",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 House Democrats, confident that public support is growing for their impeachment inquiry as they head into a second week of nationally televised hearings, are sharpening their tone as they make their case that President Trump withheld military aid from Ukraine in a bid to force its leader to investigate his political rivals. Quid pro quo is out. Extortion and bribery are in. The shift was inaugurated last week by Speaker Nancy Pelosi, when she said the \u201cdevastating testimony\u201d delivered by top diplomats \u201ccorroborated evidence of bribery.\u201d On Monday, the speaker kicked it up a notch, using the word \u201cextortion\u201d to address Republican claims that there was no wrongdoing because Mr. Trump eventually released the aid. \u201cThe fact is, the aid was only released after the whistle-blower exposed the truth of the President\u2019s extortion and bribery,\u201d she wrote in a letter to her Democratic colleagues, \u201cand the House launched a formal investigation.\u201d As lawmakers plunge into a jam-packed hearing schedule with nine witnesses lined up this week, Ms. Pelosi is clearly trying to tighten the screws on the president \u2014 and target her message to skeptical voters \u2014 with words that evoke criminal wrongdoing. In part, her more aggressive language reflects Democrats\u2019 realization that their narrative about Ukraine \u2014 a story they once thought would be simple for the public to understand \u2014 is not as clear-cut as they thought. After a week of dense hearings, Republicans have succeeded somewhat in muddying it up, and many voters are confused, while others are not even listening. And focus groups conducted by the House Democrats\u2019 campaign arm showed that the party was not helping itself by using the Latin phrase \u201cquid pro quo,\u201d which loosely translated means \u201cthis for that.\u201d At the same time, after a week of what Ms. Pelosi called \u201cdamning testimony\u201d from senior diplomats, Democrats are convinced the hearings have done damage to the president, which accounts for the more full-throated verbal assault. An ABC News/ Ipsos poll released Monday found that 70 percent of Americans believe Mr. Trump\u2019s actions regarding Ukraine \u201cwere wrong\u201d and a slim majority \u2014 51 percent \u2014 say he should be impeached and removed from office. The survey found 58 percent of Americans are following the hearings closely or somewhat closely. \u201cPelosi throws words around like manhole covers \u2014 she doesn\u2019t use them without a purpose,\u201d said David Axelrod, the Democratic strategist and former message guru for President Barack Obama, noting that Constitution specifically identifies bribery as an impeachable offense. The term, he said, conveys \u201cwhat actually happened \u2014 the president apparently withholding military aid in exchange for political favors.\u201d But accusing Mr. Trump of out-and-out criminal activity also poses risks for Democrats because it might lead voters to think they have prejudged the outcome of their investigation. \u201cThe more you look like you\u2019ve decided what the outcome is, the less effective you are,\u201d said Rahm Emanuel, the former mayor of Chicago, who worked in the White House when President Bill Clinton was impeached. Mr. Emanuel advised Democrats to remind voters that Mr. Trump is blocking lawmakers\u2019 access to documents and witnesses. \u201cI think the best politics for Democrats is: We\u2019re on a fact-finding mission; all we want is the facts,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause it juxtaposes well with a narrative that he\u2019s denying access to people and documents, and he looks like he has something to hide.\" Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster, said her research backed that up: Voters, she said, were much more comfortable with the word \u201cinquiry\u201d than \u201cimpeachment\u201d or \u201cremoval.\u201d Other phrases that tested well, she said, were \u201cfor political gain,\u201d \u201cabuse of power\u201d and \u201cno one is above the law.\u201d All of them feature prominently in Ms. Pelosi\u2019s impeachment lexicon. Ms. Lake said she was surprised to hear Ms. Pelosi use the word bribery. \u201cI would have assumed the lawyers would say, \u2018You can\u2019t say that,\u2019\u201d she said. While polls show the public is deeply split over impeachment, analysts at Navigator Research, a joint venture of several Democratic polling firms, have concluded that \u201cthere is still a segment of \u2018soft\u2019 opposition and undecideds\u201d who might be persuaded by the hearings. Nearly half of impeachment opponents \u2014 roughly one-fifth of the public \u2014 oppose impeachment but do not agree with the president that he did nothing wrong, the group wrote in a recent polling memo. Roughly a quarter of Americans \u201coffer the president full exoneration,\u201d the memo said. The group also found that so-called impeachment skeptics are likely to think the process is unfair to Mr. Trump \u2014 a sign that Republican arguments have been working. Yet among those skeptics, the most powerful argument for impeachment was the suggestion that Mr. Trump was \u201csoliciting a bribe.\u201d Still, it is unlikely that Democrats who represent Trump-friendly swing districts \u2014 the so-called front-line members who face tough re-election races this year \u2014 will adopt strong words like \u201cbribery\u201d and \u201cextortion.\u201d They are already being targeted by Republicans over impeachment. One conservative group, the American Action Network, is running a $2 million digital ad campaign urging 37 House members \u2014 30 Democrats and seven Republicans \u2014 to vote no on impeachment. In a messaging memo about impeachment sent to Democrats on Monday, Representative Cheri Bustos of Illinois, the chairwoman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, urged her colleagues to \u201ckeep the language simple, direct and values-based.\u201d Democrats, Ms. Bustos said, should use phrases like \u201cabused his power and put himself above the law\u201d when talking about Mr. Trump, and to say that Republicans who oppose the inquiry are \u201cfailing to fulfill their oath of office.\u201d \u201cEmphasize the core value that no one is above the law,\u201d she wrote. Whatever words Democrats choose to describe what is clearly a push to Mr. Trump\u2019s inevitable impeachment, they have abandoned the Latin quid pro quo. Representative Jan Schakowsky, who holds a safe Democratic seat in Illinois, laughed about it when asked. \u201cOh no, we\u2019re not using that word anymore,\u201d she said wryly. \u201cIt\u2019s extortion or bribery, haven\u2019t you heard?\u201d",

      "author": "Sheryl Gay Stolberg",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Representative Jim Jordan, a scrappy former wrestler and firebrand founder of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, has always relished a fight. So it was no surprise this week when, as President Trump\u2019s chief defender in the impeachment inquiry, he interrupted the staid tone of the first public hearing and let it rip. \u201cAnd you\u2019re their star witness?\u201d he thundered at William B. Taylor Jr., the top diplomat in Ukraine, after prodding Mr. Taylor on Wednesday to say that he had never met the president, and that his information was secondhand. \u201cYou\u2019re their first witness! You\u2019re the guy?! I\u2019ve seen church prayer chains that are easier to understand than this.\u201d For Mr. Jordan of Ohio, it was both an attention-grabbing moment and a chance to redeem himself with Republican leaders after years of being on the outs. The party is relying on him to frame the narrative Republicans offer to the public as Mr. Trump faces the gravest threat yet to his presidency. It is one in which the president is a victim, witnesses are trafficking in hearsay at best, and working to undercut the duly elected president at worst, and Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign to press Ukraine to investigate his political rivals was a perfectly appropriate exercise of executive power. On Friday, Mr. Jordan\u2019s gloves-off style \u2014 part pit bull, part rat-a-tat auctioneer \u2014 was put to the test when Marie L. Yovanovitch, the ousted ambassador to Ukraine, testified in deeply personal terms about how she felt \u201cthreatened\u201d by Mr. Trump after it emerged that he had told President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine that she was \u201cbad news\u201d and would \u201cgo through some things.\u201d Mr. Jordan, apparently working to avoid appearing to bully her, treaded relatively lightly in addressing Ms. Yovanovitch. He reserved his tart tongue for the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Representative Adam B. Schiff, who tried to force the Ohio congressman to wrap up his questioning as he blew through the five-minute limit. \u201cMy indulgence is wearing out,\u201d Mr. Schiff said. \u201cOur indulgence wore out with you a long time ago, Mr. Chairman,\u201d Mr. Jordan shot back. A rumble emerged from the audience, which uttered a collective \u201cOooooh.\u201d Mr. Jordan was installed on the intelligence panel at the last minute by Representative Kevin McCarthy, the Republican leader, so that he could take a prominent role in the public questioning. He and other Republicans on the panel spent part of Thursday in \u201cmurder boards\u201d \u2014 mock hearings \u2014 to prepare. \u201cIt\u2019s just like adding a pinch-hitter or a relief pitcher,\u201d Mr. McCarthy said in an interview. With polls showing the public deeply split on whether Mr. Trump deserves to be impeached, and views hardening along party lines, Mr. Jordan is unlikely to change any minds. But for now, his presence on the panel is assuaging the Republican base, which is looking for someone tough to go up against Mr. Schiff, Democrat of California, a strait-laced former federal prosecutor. \u201cI think it is helpful in a setting dominated by Schiff to have somebody who\u2019s willing to be the equivalent of a middle linebacker in football,\u201d said Newt Gingrich, who was speaker during the impeachment of President Bill Clinton. \u201cHe\u2019s willing to plunge in and make the tough case, and do it in very understandable language.\u201d Technically, Representative Devin Nunes, the ranking Republican on the intelligence panel, is Mr. Schiff\u2019s counterpart. But during weeks of closed-door depositions, Mr. Jordan, the top Republican on the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, took the lead in questioning witnesses. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t know better, you would think he was a prosecutor,\u201d said Representative Steve Scalise, the No. 3 House Republican. A former state legislator and law school graduate who never took the bar, Mr. Jordan is a two-time N.C.C.A. Division 1 wrestling champion in the 134-pound (lightweight) class. He rarely wears a suit jacket, and his failure to don one on Wednesday drew the attention of Robin Givhan, the fashion critic for The Washington Post. \u201cIt\u2019s his power move,\u201d she wrote. \u201cHis sartorial chest thump.\u201d But Mr. Jordan seemed unable to rattle Mr. Taylor, a seasoned diplomat with a full head of gray hair and a stentorian voice that evoked memories of Walter Cronkite. Reading Mr. Taylor\u2019s own testimony back to him, Mr. Jordan reminded the witness that he had said it was his \u201cclear understanding\u201d that Ukraine would not receive nearly $400 million in military aid from the United States until Mr. Zelensky announced the investigations. That is the essence of Democrats\u2019 case that Mr. Trump abused his power. \u201cNow with all due respect ambassador, your clear understanding was obviously wrong, because it didn\u2019t happen,\u201d Mr. Jordan said sharply, going on to note that Mr. Zelensky never made such an announcement and that the aid was ultimately released. (He neglected to say that Mr. Trump released it under pressure from lawmakers on Capitol Hill.) \u201cSo I\u2019m wondering, where\u2019d you get this clear understanding?\u201d Mr. Jordan said, wrapping up. Mr. Taylor was unbowed: \u201cAs I testified, Mr. Jordan, this came from Mr. Sondland,\u201d he said, referring to Gordon D. Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union and an ally of Mr. Trump. Mr. Jordan, in a brief interview, said he was simply trying to get at the truth \u2014 at least as Republicans see it. \u201cOur job is to get out the facts, the truth, and let the American people know that the facts are on the president\u2019s side, strongly on the president\u2019s side, and let the American people see what they already know, which is that the process is unfair,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will just keep doing that.\u201d Democrats, both here in Washington and in his home state of Ohio, see Mr. Jordan as bomb-thrower who is more interested in theatrics and obfuscation than substance. Julian Epstein, who served as the Democrats\u2019 lead counsel in the impeachment of Mr. Clinton, called Mr. Jordan a \u201ccarnival barker who peddles dopamine to the base.\u201d Jerry Austin, a Democratic strategist in Ohio, called Mr. Jordan \u201ca colossal jerk,\u201d adding, \u201cHe basically is an actor, playing the part of this right-wing conservative congressman that whatever Donald Trump does, he\u2019s defending.\u201d At home in Ohio, Mr. Jordan is the subject of controversy, amid complaints from former college wrestlers who say that when he was a young assistant wrestling coach at Ohio State University, he turned a blind eye to allegations that a team doctor was abusing the athletes. Mr. Jordan has said he did not know of the abuse, and heard no locker-room talk about it, though an investigation commissioned by the university found it was an \u201copen secret.\u201d Many of the wrestlers who accused him argue the congressman, then in his early 20s, should not be blamed because he could not have done much to protect them. One outspoken wrestler, Dunyasha Yetts, said that Mr. Jordan in fact did the right thing and confronted the doctor about being too hands-on with the students. But they were privately disappointed that Mr. Jordan sought to deflect any accusations of wrongdoing by arguing that wrestlers who came forward were politically motivated and part of the so-called deep state \u2014 a defense that sounds much as if it could have come from the president he is defending now. That Mr. Jordan is in his current role reflects how the once-fractured Republican conference has come together in the Trump era. When Republicans were in the majority, Mr. Jordan and his fellow conservatives made trouble for the Republican leadership, often balking at their legislative agenda. After Republicans lost the majority last year, Mr. Jordan challenged Mr. McCarthy for the top leadership spot \u2014 and lost. That generated what another member of leadership, Representative Patrick T. McHenry of North Carolina, called \u201cbad blood\u201d between them. Despite that, Mr. McCarthy gave Mr. Jordan the ranking position on the oversight panel, a plum job. The two men were freshmen lawmakers together \u2014 both were elected in 2006 \u2014 and Mr. McCarthy said he admired Mr. Jordan\u2019s \u201cwork ethic\u201d and tenacity. He gave Mr. Jordan the job, he said, over the strong objections of others in Republican leadership who warned him that he would regret it. He said he has not.",

      "author": "Sharon LaFraniere",
      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 For decades, Roger J. Stone Jr. played politics as a kind of performance art, starring himself as a professional lord of mischief, as a friend once called him. He tossed bombs and spun tales from the political periphery with no real reckoning, burnishing a reputation as a dirty trickster. On Friday morning, a reckoning arrived, the consequence of his efforts to sabotage a congressional investigation that threatened his longtime friend President Trump. Mr. Stone, 67, was convicted in federal court of seven felonies for obstructing the congressional inquiry, lying to investigators under oath and trying to block the testimony of a witness whose account would have exposed his lies. Jurors deliberated for a little over seven hours before convicting him on all counts. Together, the charges carry a maximum prison term of 50 years. In a last-minute bid for salvation, prosecutors said, Mr. Stone appealed to Mr. Trump for a pardon on Thursday, using a right-wing conspiracy theorist who runs the website Infowars as his proxy. Mr. Trump attacked the guilty verdict against Mr. Stone in a tweet on Friday but made no mention of a pardon. To some friends, Mr. Stone\u2019s fatal flaw was that he did not know when the time for gamesmanship was over. \u201cThe only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about,\u201d he liked to say. But that mantra seemed to ring hollow as Mr. Stone, forced to stand in silence, heard a courtroom deputy read the word \u201cguilty\u201d seven times. The impeachment inquiry underway nearby on Capitol Hill overshadowed news of the verdict, but it was nonetheless another setback for the president. Mr. Stone is the sixth former Trump aide to be convicted in cases stemming from the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election. And the trial revived the saga of Russia\u2019s efforts to bolster Mr. Trump\u2019s chances of winning the White House just as House impeachment investigators are scrutinizing how Mr. Trump pressured another government, Ukraine, to help with his 2020 re-election chances. Prosecutors said Mr. Stone tried to thwart the work of the House Intelligence Committee because the truth would have \u201clooked terrible\u201d for both Mr. Trump and his campaign. They built their case over the past week with testimony from a friend of Mr. Stone and two former Trump campaign officials: Rick Gates, the deputy campaign chairman, and Stephen K. Bannon, who led the campaign through its final three months and served as a White House strategist early in the administration. Hundreds of exhibits that exposed Mr. Stone\u2019s disdain for congressional and criminal investigators buttressed the testimony. The evidence showed that in the months before the 2016 election, Mr. Stone strove to obtain emails that Russia had stolen from Democratic computers and funneled to WikiLeaks, which released them at strategic moments timed to damage Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump\u2019s Democratic opponent. \u201cEvery chance he got,\u201d prosecutors said, Mr. Stone briefed the Trump campaign about whatever he had picked up about WikiLeaks\u2019 plans. But he told the House committee in September 2017 that he never described to anyone involved in the Trump campaign his conversations with an intermediary to WikiLeaks. The trial called into question Mr. Trump\u2019s own answers to queries from Mr. Mueller. The president, who refused to be interviewed and agreed to respond to questions only in writing, said he could not recall the specifics of any of 21 conversations he had with Mr. Stone in the six months before the election. In one of the trial\u2019s most revealing moments, Mr. Gates recounted a July 31, 2016, phone call between Mr. Stone and Mr. Trump, just days after WikiLeaks had released a trove of emails embarrassing the Clinton campaign. As soon as he hung up with Mr. Stone, Mr. Gates testified, Mr. Trump declared that \u201cmore information\u201d was coming, an apparent reference to future releases from WikiLeaks that would rattle his political rival. Within minutes of the verdict, Mr. Trump protested on Twitter that it was unfair. \u201cSo they now convict Roger Stone of lying and want to jail him for many years to come,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote, though his own administration\u2019s Justice Department prosecuted Mr. Stone. He then listed the names of nearly a dozen favorite targets of his ire, including Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Mueller, the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey and Representative Adam B. Schiff, who heads the House Intelligence Committee. \u201cDidn\u2019t they lie?\u201d he tweeted, and then added: \u201cA double standard like never seen before in the history of our Country?\u201d Mr. Stone joins a notable list of former Trump aides who either pleaded guilty or were convicted of federal crimes in cases stemming from Mr. Mueller\u2019s work. It includes Mr. Gates; Michael T. Flynn, the former national security adviser; Michael D. Cohen, the president\u2019s longtime fixer; George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign aide; and Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman and Mr. Stone\u2019s onetime partner in a political consulting firm. Although the counts against him add up to 50 years, the punishment for Mr. Stone, who had no previous criminal record, will almost certainly be far lighter. On the other hand, his multiple run-ins earlier this year with Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who will sentence him on Feb. 6, could work against him. After a series of infractions, including posting a photo of the judge with an image of cross-hairs next to her head on Instagram in February, she banned him from social media. After the verdict, prosecutors asked Judge Jackson to put Mr. Stone behind bars, arguing that he had defied her once again by passing the message to Infowars\u2019 Alex Jones, saying, \u201cI appeal to the president to pardon me.\u201d But the judge said it was not entirely clear whether Mr. Stone had disobeyed her and noted that he had complied with her orders in recent months. Mr. Stone\u2019s lawyers argued that the prosecution\u2019s case was based on speculation and false assumptions about Mr. Stone\u2019s motives. Mr. Stone had no reason to lie in order to protect the president nearly a year after Mr. Trump had won the election, Bruce S. Rogow, the lead defense lawyer, told jurors. Mr. Stone had simply confined his answers to the strict parameters of the committee\u2019s inquiry, he argued. He also said that even though Mr. Stone had portrayed himself to the campaign as Mr. Trump\u2019s link to WikiLeaks, that was just more of Mr. Stone\u2019s typical braggadocio. Much of the trial revolved around relationship between Mr. Stone and Randy Credico, a New York radio host and comedian. The charge that Mr. Stone had tried to block Mr. Credico from testifying to the House committee was the most serious one he faced, carrying a maximum penalty of 20 years. Mr. Credico ultimately asserted his Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination and refused to testify to the House committee. He testified at the trial that despite the fact he repeatedly urged Mr. Stone to tell the truth, he falsely identified him to congressional investigators as his intermediary with Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks. Previously in their tortured 17-year friendship, he said, Mr. Stone had treated him as his \u201cpatsy.\u201d In an effort to ward off Mr. Credico\u2019s congressional testimony, the evidence showed, Mr. Stone alternately flattered, bullied and threatened the radio host. At one point, Mr. Stone pretended that he had written a letter to the House committee characterizing Mr. Credico as highly talented and successful. At other points, he urged Mr. Credico to \u201cDo a Frank Pentangeli,\u201d referring to a character in the movie \u201cThe Godfather: Part II\u201d who gave false testimony during a Senate hearing on organized crime. Borrowing a quote from Richard M. Nixon to a top aide during the Watergate cover-up, Mr. Stone texted Mr. Credico in late 2017: \u201cStonewall it. Plead the fifth. Anything to save the plan.\u201d If he refused to go along, Mr. Credico testified, Mr. Stone promised to retaliate against him and Margaret Ratner Kunstler, a lawyer for Mr. Assange and one of Mr. Credico\u2019s dearest friends. Prosecutors described Ms. Kunstler as a particularly effective \u201cpressure point\u201d with Mr. Credico, an unmarried man with no children and a 34-year history of alcohol abuse. One of Mr. Stone\u2019s most blatant deceptions, prosecutors said, was hiding records of his communications. He told congressional investigators that he and Mr. Credico only spoke on the phone, because Mr. Credico \u201cwas not an email guy.\u201d In fact, in the year and a half before Mr. Stone testified, he and Mr. Credico exchanged more than 1,500 emails and text messages, including 72 texts alone on the day of Mr. Stone\u2019s congressional testimony. Because Mr. Stone misled the committee, prosecutors said, investigators failed to pursue promising leads and arrived at inaccurate conclusions in its final report on Russia\u2019s election interference. Mr. Credico tried for months to warn Mr. Stone that his lies would catch up to him. Among Mr. Stone\u2019s responses: \u201cNice try.\u201d \u201cMeaningless.\u201d \u201cSo what.\u201d And, \u201cNo one cares.\u201d",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Two top national security officials offered new details about President Trump\u2019s pressure campaign on Ukraine as they appeared for testimony during the second week of public hearings in House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry. At issue is whether Mr. Trump abused his power by holding out security aid and a coveted White House meeting from the Ukrainian government in exchange for an announcement from Ukraine\u2019s president of investigations that could benefit Mr. Trump politically. Here are the new revelations from the officials, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman and Jennifer Williams. Tuesday morning\u2019s witnesses provided a new window into how the national security establishment reacted to the decision to freeze $391 million in security aid for Ukraine for 55 days. Colonel Vindman, the top Ukraine expert at the National Security Council, and Ms. Williams, an adviser to Vice President Mike Pence, both testified that they knew of no one at the National Security Council \u2014 the foreign policy arm of the White House \u2014 the State Department or the Pentagon who supported holding up the aid. \u201cNone,\u201d Colonel Vindman said. Colonel Vindman and Ms. Williams were the first two witnesses at a public hearing who listened in real time to Mr. Trump\u2019s now-infamous July call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. Both said they were alarmed; Ms. Williams called the call \u201cunusual and inappropriate\u201d while Colonel Vindman said it was \u201cwrong.\u201d But Ms. Williams said she told no one about her concerns, while Colonel Vindman offered new detail of what he did after the call: He told an intelligence officer and a State Department official before reporting his concerns to the security council\u2019s top lawyer. Together, their responses contrasted with other witnesses who have said they heard nothing wrong with the call. Colonel Vindman provided new details about how the reconstructed transcript of the call ended up in a secure White House server. He testified that he believed that John A. Eisenberg, the senior lawyer at the National Security Council to whom he reported his concerns about the call, intended to put the reconstructed transcript into a secure system to limit access and prevent leaks. \u201cI didn\u2019t take it as anything nefarious,\u201d the colonel testified. His testimony contradicts Timothy Morrison, his former direct superior at the council, who has told lawmakers that the transcript was accidentally put on the secure system. Colonel Vindman testified that he believed that Mr. Trump\u2019s request for Ukraine to open investigations into the \u201c2016 election, the Bidens and Burisma\u201d \u2014 inquiries that could help Mr. Trump\u2019s re-election chances \u2014 should be viewed as demands that were \u201cinappropriate and had nothing to do with national security.\u201d Colonel Vindman also revealed a new understanding about how he conveyed to his superiors his concerns over a White House meeting on July 10 with Ukrainian officials. He said he immediately spoke to Mr. Eisenberg, adding to a similar account from Fiona Hill, who at the time was Colonel Vindman\u2019s superior at the National Security Council. Ms. Williams and Colonel Vindman added texture to the frustration inside the government about the shadow Ukraine foreign policy being conducted by the president\u2019s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani and others. Colonel Vindman testified that he quickly became aware of \u201cformer mayor Rudy Giuliani\u2019s promoting false narratives that undermined the United States\u2019 Ukraine policy.\u201d Their testimony confirms many of the other impeachment witnesses who have described Mr. Giuliani, who has no official government job, as having an outsize role in influencing Mr. Trump\u2019s position on Ukraine. The White House and the president\u2019s Republican allies revealed a key part of their impeachment strategy as they sought to aggressively undermine Colonel Vindman\u2019s credibility. Republican lawmakers confronted Colonel Vindman with comments from Mr. Morrison questioning his judgment. The colonel, an Iraq war veteran who received a Purple Heart after being wounded by a roadside bomb, was ready for the attack, citing a work evaluation from Ms. Hill that said he was \u201cbrilliant, unflappable and exercises excellent judgment.\u201d The White House ignored that and tweeted out the disparaging quote from Mr. Morrison, making it clear that even a decorated veteran who is still a National Security Council aide was not off limits.",

      "author": "Charlie Savage",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 A full federal appeals court on Wednesday let stand an earlier ruling that President Trump\u2019s accounting firm must turn over eight years of his financial records to Congress, bringing the case to the threshold of a likely Supreme Court battle. In the latest of a string of court losses for Mr. Trump over his uncompromising vow to fight \u201call\u201d subpoenas from Congress, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia rejected his request that it rehear a case in which he challenged the subpoena to the firm, Mazars USA. A panel of the court had sided with lawmakers in that earlier ruling. The president will now appeal to the Supreme Court, said a lawyer for Mr. Trump, Jay Sekulow. If the justices take the case, as seems likely, it would add another blockbuster case over separation of powers to the court\u2019s current term, which ends in June \u2014 in the middle of the presidential election campaign. \u201cIn light of the well-reasoned dissent, we will be seeking review at the Supreme Court,\u201d Mr. Sekulow said in a statement. Lawyers representing Mr. Trump had argued that Congress had no legitimate legislative authority to seek his business records because the panel seeking them, the House Oversight and Reform Committee, was primarily trying to determine whether he broke existing laws \u2014 not weighing whether to enact a new one. Lawyers for House Democrats rejected that argument, maintaining that it was well within Congress\u2019s constitutional authority to seek the records \u2014 both as a matter of oversight and as it considered whether new presidential ethics and financial disclosure laws are necessary. A three-judge appeals court panel in October rejected that sweeping argument and upheld Congress\u2019s authority to issue the subpoena by a 2-to-1 vote. But Mr. Trump petitioned the full court to erase that ruling and reconsider the case. The court on Wednesday rejected his request, 8 to 3. The case was set in motion before House Democrats announced and then voted to say that they were engaged in an impeachment inquiry, so their constitutional authority to investigate potential presidential misconduct for the purpose of considering whether Mr. Trump should be removed from office has not been part of the legal arguments in the case. The committee sought the records after Democrats took control of the House in the 2018 midterm election, and after it came to light that Mr. Trump had failed to list on his ethics disclosure forms a debt that he owed and then repaid to his former lawyer and fixer, Michael D. Cohen. Mr. Cohen had fronted a hush payment to a pornographic actress, Stormy Daniels, just before the 2016 election to induce her to keep quiet about an affair she claimed to have had with Mr. Trump. He has denied the relationship. Mr. Cohen also testified before Congress that Mr. Trump fraudulently changed the value of his assets for different purposes, like inflating their value on loan applications but deflating them on tax filings. (Mr. Cohen was separately convicted of lying to Congress in earlier testimony.) The eight judges in the majority included seven appointed by Democratic presidents, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. One, Judge Thomas Griffith, was appointed by President George W. Bush, a Republican. The three judges who dissented were all appointed by Republican presidents. Two were appointed by Mr. Trump, Gregory Katsas and Neomi Rao, and the third was a judge appointed by President George Bush, Karen L. Henderson. Ms. Rao had been the dissenting vote in the earlier panel decision. None of the judges in the majority filed a new opinion supplementing the panel\u2019s ruling. Judge David S. Tatel had written that the judges on the panel concluded that the subpoena to Mazars is valid because \u201cthe public record reveals legitimate legislative pursuits, not an impermissible law enforcement purpose, behind the committee\u2019s subpoena.\u201d Judge Katsas, who was Mr. Trump\u2019s deputy White House counsel before Mr. Trump appointed him to the court in December 2017, wrote a brief opinion dissenting from the court\u2019s decision not to rehear the case, which Judge Henderson joined. He wrote that if \u201cone committee of one House of Congress\u201d can compel a president to disclose personal records whenever it conceivably could pass legislation regarding the presidency, it would pose a serious \u201cthreat to presidential autonomy and independence.\u201d Judge Rao was the head of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs in Mr. Trump\u2019s White House before he appointed her to the bench in March. She separately wrote a brief opinion reiterating the thrust of her longer dissent in the panel decision. Essentially, she said that because Congress was not relying on its impeachment power when it issued the subpoena, its legislative power alone was insufficient to justify the \u201cunprecedented\u201d request. In her new opinion, she also rejected House Democrats\u2019 argument that the question of which kind of legal authority it was invoking was no longer of \u201cpractical consequence\u201d because two weeks ago, the full House voted for a resolution endorsing the impeachment investigation, which it styled as \u201congoing.\u201d She noted that the House had not reissued its subpoena for the financial records since then and argued that the resolution did not affect the legal basis for the committee\u2019s earlier demand for Mr. Trump\u2019s accounting records.",

      "author": "Alan Rappeport",
      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump\u2019s increasing reliance on economic sanctions to solve foreign policy problems is fueling concern that the United States is abusing its financial power and prompting some governments to seek ways to evade American measures. In recent months, the United States has increased pressure on Iran and Venezuela, dangled the removal of North Korean sanctions and, in only a few days, imposed, then reversed, sanctions against Turkey. Now, American allies and adversaries alike are stepping up efforts to protect themselves in ways that could, over time, erode American power by undermining a key national security tool and diminishing the world\u2019s reliance on the dollar as the global reserve currency. In October, Turkey and Russia agreed to a new system for international transactions that would use their local currencies instead of the dollar, which President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia said in October is being employed by the Trump administration as a \u201cpolitical weapon.\u201d Russia has been holding similar talks with Iran and China about an alternative system that, according to Russian state media, could allow the countries to engage in transactions while evading the arm of United States sanctions. And the European Union moved ahead this year with developing an alternative system that would allow countries to bypass the existing infrastructure for international financial transactions. Mr. Trump\u2019s scattershot approach to sanctions was on display this week with the visit of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey to the White House. In October, Mr. Trump threatened to \u201cdestroy\u201d Turkey\u2019s economy after its military incursion into Syria. He then withdrew the sanctions after brokering a cease-fire. Now, officials are considering new measures because of Turkey\u2019s purchase of a missile defense system from Russia. \u201cThey are throwing sanctions at everybody for everything,\u201d said Richard Nephew, a scholar at Columbia University\u2019s Center on Global Energy Policy and the author of \u201cThe Art of Sanctions.\u201d \u201cThe administration seems to think that sanctions are a surrogate for foreign policy.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s use of sanctions has far exceeded those of his predecessors\u2019, both in scale and the scope of his targets. In 2018, the Trump administration added about 1,500 individuals and entities to its sanctions list, a total that is 50 percent more than in any prior year, according to a tally from the law firm Gibson Dunn. Through late October of this year, another 606 sanctions designations had been added. The United States has steadily broadened its use of sanctions since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, using its place at the center of the global financial system to stifle the economies of adversaries and disrupt the flow of illicit funds to terrorist organizations. Mr. Trump has expanded the punitive measures, targeting them at NATO allies like Turkey and expanding the use of secondary sanctions against countries and companies that continue to do business with adversaries like Iran. Experts warn that the administration\u2019s haphazard use of tools that freeze assets and cut people and countries off from the world\u2019s banking system could undermine the entire program by spawning new workarounds. \u201cSanctions alone will never solve your problem unless they are used in tandem with other tools,\u201d said Matthew Levitt, a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. \u201cWe tend now to be seeing sanctions as the nonkinetic, nonmilitary tool for everything.\u201d Mr. Levitt, who served as deputy assistant secretary for intelligence and analysis at the Treasury Department during the George W. Bush administration, added, \u201cI do worry about a time when overreliance on sanctions, absent the use of complementary diplomatic and other tools, could undermine the U.S. position in the world economy.\u201d There have been early signs of such a shift. Over the past year, the European Union has rolled out the Instrument in Support of Trade Exchanges, or INSTEX, as an alternative to the Swift financial messaging service, which facilitates the majority of international financial transactions. It would allow European countries to complete transactions with Iran through what is essentially a bartering system. While Europe has said that it would use this only for sales of humanitarian goods, which are acceptable, the United States has expressed concern that the payments vehicle could be used to evade sanctions. Venezuela and North Korea have also increased their interest in cryptocurrencies, which could be used to circumvent the traditional banking system, according Peter Harrell, a sanctions expert at the Center for a New American Security. And Russia has shifted billions of dollars\u2019 worth of sovereign reserves, which are held in American banks, into gold as a way to reduce the potential effect of additional sanctions. \u201cThe question is are we now reaching the point where both adversaries and allies will invest in the kinds of tools that will let them fundamentally get out from under our leverage,\u201d Mr. Harrell said. \u201cWe are seeing signs that they are pursuing these investments.\u201d The future of such investments could hinge on Mr. Trump\u2019s re-election. John E. Smith, who was the director of the Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control until last year, said that other countries would most likely move to further distance themselves from America\u2019s teeth if Mr. Trump wins a second term. \u201cWhile Europeans are still working on INSTEX, people recognize this administration is being aggressive and tough on implementation and enforcement of sanctions, and there\u2019s nothing they can really do in the short term,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cThey\u2019re incredibly frustrated and angry, but they are resigned to waiting this out for the next year to see what happens.\u201d The United States is watching these efforts warily and trying to reinforce alliances to exert pressure on Iran and other adversaries. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin recently embarked on a 10-day, five-country trip across the Middle East and India where he sought to strengthen connections with gulf nations. In an interview with The New York Times on Oct. 30 in Saudi Arabia, Mr. Mnuchin defended the administration\u2019s use of sanctions, saying they were inhibiting the flow of terrorist financing around the world and keeping the United States out of military conflicts. \u201cThe president realizes the power of these sanctions and they are very important for national security and they are a great alternative to military operations,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said. At the beginning of his presidency, Mr. Trump was essentially extending sanctions that had existed under previous administrations. But he has since ramped up his own efforts, in part because of his dislike for other types of warfare. Unlike some who have advised Mr. Trump in the national security arena \u2014 most notably John R. Bolton, the former national security adviser \u2014 the president is not a hawk in favor of military intervention, instead preferring to focus on his own negotiation skills, according to two former senior administration officials with direct knowledge of the sanctions process. One of them, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the president\u2019s thinking, said Mr. Trump had brought up the idea of sanctions to curb malign behavior because he \u201clikes the idea of maximum pressure\u201d without \u201cfiring one shot.\u201d Another person familiar with his thinking said that Mr. Trump \u2014 who enjoyed attacking and pressuring competitors in the business world \u2014 tended to use the same sort of pugilistic language when describing sanctions, and enjoyed that \u201call he has to do is sign a piece of paper\u201d to enact them. That was evident in October when Mr. Trump threatened to decimate the Turkish economy as Turkish troops advanced into northern Syria. \u201cAs I have stated strongly before, and just to reiterate, if Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter, \u201cI will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey (I\u2019ve done before!)\u201d But that and other instances have raised questions about the effectiveness of Mr. Trump\u2019s threats. In October, Mr. Erdogan agreed to a temporary cease-fire against Kurdish fighters after meeting with Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. But Mr. Erdogan did not agree to a troop drawdown, and the crippling sanctions the Trump administration had threatened were eased. This year, the administration relied heavily on placing sanctions on individuals close to President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro of Venezuela. In the months since, the White House has faced criticism for further weakening a fractured Venezuelan economy but not ultimately removing Mr. Maduro, who has given little indication that he will cede control to Juan Guaid\u00f3, the Venezuelan opposition leader favored by the United States. Mr. Trump has at times questioned the effectiveness of the Venezuela strategy, but his aides continue to roll out an aggressive suite of sanctions. Iran also continues to be defiant in the face of stiffer measures that were imposed after the United States\u2019 withdrawal from the 2015 international nuclear agreement. In September, Iran launched an attack against Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil infrastructure, and this month, it announced that it would begin injecting uranium gas into centrifuges at a fortified nuclear facility. Mr. Mnuchin said Iran would be even more emboldened to destabilize the Middle East without a squeeze on its financial resources. \u201cThe fact that we\u2019ve cut back as much money as we have had prevented them from funding what would have been a much bigger terror operation. Quite frankly, we do think it\u2019s been very impactful,\u201d he said. The United States has warned that it will not stand for any form of sanctions evasion without a fight, saying it will impose secondary actions against governments if they do business with Iran. Mr. Mnuchin acknowledged that over \u201ca long period of time\u201d there was a risk that the rest of the world could shift away from the dollar as the reserve currency and that the United States must be responsible with how it wielded sanctions. But he suggested that, for now, other countries have little choice but to comply. \u201cThe reason why they are so effective is because the dollar is the reserve currency of the world,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said. \u201cOther countries may not like adhering to our sanctions, but because the dollar is the reserve currency and their banking systems are attached to dollars and dollars are a major component of trade, that\u2019s why people have to cease activities.\u201d",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 David Holmes, a career diplomat and political counselor to the United States Embassy in Ukraine, and Fiona Hill, a former Europe and Russia expert at the White House, schooled lawmakers on Thursday on the United States\u2019 geopolitical relationship with Ukraine and provided some new details about the efforts to pressure Ukraine to announce investigations into President Trump\u2019s political rivals. They both highlighted their apolitical and nonpartisan expertise and experience in foreign policy, a direct contrast to the witness a day earlier, Gordon D. Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union. Mr. Sondland is a wealthy Republican donor with no diplomatic experience before his 2018 appointment to the plum post in Brussels. Here are some key points from Thursday\u2019s testimony. Responding to questions from Republicans, Dr. Hill explained the crux of the issue at the heart of the impeachment inquiry \u2014 the United States had two separate agendas operating in Ukraine, yet those involved in each viewed theirs was the only one. Dr. Hill said she and other career foreign policy officials were frustrated with what Mr. Sondland was doing outside the normal channels of interagency coordination. Dr. Hill thought Mr. Sondland\u2019s goal of getting President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to announce investigations into Mr. Trump\u2019s political rivals was trivial and contrary to longstanding efforts regarding Ukraine. On Wednesday, Mr. Sondland told lawmakers that he did not understand how there could be an irregular back channel when his channel included the president of the United States, members of the president\u2019s cabinet and the national security adviser. \u201cI don\u2019t know how they can consider us to be the irregular channel and they to be the regular channel when it\u2019s the leadership that makes the decisions,\u201d Mr. Sondland said. During an intense exchange with Mr. Sondland at the time, Dr. Hill said she told him, \u201cThis is all going to blow up.\u201d She added, \u201cAnd here we are.\u201d Mr. Holmes provided more details on Thursday about the now infamous lunch he had with Mr. Sondland and two other State Department staffers on July 26 in Kyiv. It was at this lunch that Mr. Holmes overheard a phone call between Mr. Sondland and Mr. Trump \u2014 one in which Mr. Trump asked Mr. Sondland if the Ukrainian president planned \u201cto do the investigation.\u201d Mr. Holmes described a relaxed setting at an outdoor terrace with the weather that day in the upper 70s. Mr. Sondland ordered a bottle of wine, he said, which the four of them shared, and discussed marketing strategies for Mr. Sondland\u2019s boutique hotel business. The additional details add more credibility to Mr. Holmes\u2019s recollection, which Republicans have tried to diminish. Mr. Sondland on Wednesday told lawmakers that he did not remember all of the details of that conversation with Mr. Trump, but he agreed that a friendly comment recalled by Mr. Holmes \u2014 Mr. Sondland telling the president that Mr. Zelensky \u201cloves your ass\u201d \u2014 sounded like something he would say. Mr. Trump on Thursday said that what Mr. Holmes described \u2014 a conversation that was not on speaker phone but could still be overheard \u2014 was virtually impossible. Mr. Holmes described what other witnesses have depicted \u2014 that the sudden involvement of President Trump\u2019s private lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, in foreign policy involving Ukraine was disruptive and damaging to the American goal of helping Ukraine defend itself against Russia. While Mr. Holmes described how the Giuliani-led campaign evolved starting in March, Representative Devin Nunes, Republican of California and the ranking member on the House Intelligence committee, focused on one date \u2014 July 25 \u2014 when Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky spoke to each other by phone. That call was at the center of the whistle-blower complaint that led to the current impeachment inquiry. One of the Republican defenses for Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to place a hold on nearly $400 million in military aid is that the president was always suspicious of Ukraine \u2014 and for good reason \u2014 because of its systemic corruption. This, Republicans say, is why he wanted a commitment from Mr. Zelensky to pursue corruption investigations. Dr. Hill, in her opening remarks, attempted to shut down this and other theories, some promoted by the committee\u2019s top Republican, Mr. Nunes, who described the impeachment hearings as \u201cbizarre\u201d on Thursday.",

      "author": "Catie Edmondson",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Some of President Trump\u2019s staunchest defenders in the Senate have twisted themselves into contortions to avoid becoming enmeshed in the impeachment inquiry into his pressure campaign on Ukraine. Then there is Senator Ron Johnson. Long an outspoken advocate of Ukraine, Mr. Johnson, a manufacturing baron from northeastern Wisconsin elected in 2010 on the Tea Party wave, has landed squarely in the middle of the impeachment inquiry. He is now emerging as one of Mr. Trump\u2019s most vocal congressional allies. The outsize role Mr. Johnson has played in Mr. Trump\u2019s Ukraine policy was illustrated in an 11-page slash-and-burn letter he released on Monday. In that telling, he appeared over and over as a supporting character in a series of events House investigators are scrutinizing alongside a number of witnesses who will testify this week. He was there in Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine, and conveyed to the country\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, that he had tried but failed to persuade Mr. Trump to release the aid. He was there in the Oval Office next to two of the inquiry\u2019s key witnesses to brief Mr. Trump about their meeting with Mr. Zelensky after his inauguration. He was there to personally confront Mr. Trump about allegations he was withholding military aid to Ukraine in exchange for a guarantee the nation would investigate his political rivals. \u201cIt\u2019s vintage Ron Johnson,\u201d said Brandon Scholz, a Republican strategist and former executive director of the Wisconsin Republican state party. \u201cHe\u2019s in deeper water than most others, and I don\u2019t think he\u2019s afraid to be there.\u201d As a member of the Foreign Relations Committee and a leader of the Senate Ukraine Caucus, Mr. Johnson has for years traveled to Ukraine and worked to build a relationship with the nation\u2019s officials. Now considered a witness with firsthand information, he is prepared to use the newfound spotlight to defend the president. In his letter, sent to the top Republicans on the House Intelligence and Oversight and Reform Committees upon their request, Mr. Johnson initiated a broadside against the Democratic-led inquiry as \u201ca concerted, and possibly coordinated effort to sabotage the Trump administration that probably began in earnest the day after the 2016 presidential election.\u201d He singled out Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman, who testified on Tuesday, as a possible bureaucrat out to get the president. Colonel Vindman testified on Tuesday that he is not a \u201cNever Trumper\u201d and, as a military officer assigned to the National Security Council, is strictly nonpartisan. Mr. Johnson in the past has been an outspoken advocate of protections for whistle-blowers and oversaw a hearing in 2015 where he emphasized their importance. \u201cIt is the only way we are going to reform government, reform bureaucracy, is if people know about it, if the public has the light of day shone upon abuse and corruption,\u201d he said then. But in his letter on Monday, he offered a caveat: \u201cNot all whistle-blowers are created equal.\u201d An anonymous whistle-blower complaint first brought to light concern about a call between Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky. In an interview on Tuesday, Mr. Johnson said it was \u201cdisappointing\u201d that the news media had focused on his concerns about an entrenched bureaucratic class working against the president. \u201cThe real guts of my response,\u201d he said, was not about those fears, adding that he had \u201cnothing but the utmost respect\u201d for Colonel Vindman. Still, he continued, he found some of the colonel\u2019s testimony \u201cpretty strange.\u201d His Republican colleagues in the Senate in large measure have been more restrained in dealing with the president\u2019s Ukraine policies and the ensuing investigation into them. Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, who called the president and successfully implored him to release the aid to Ukraine, has methodically kept out of the limelight ever since. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a usual defender of Mr. Trump and the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, has steadfastly ignored entreaties from the right to conduct his own counterinvestigation, and he has tried to pass that baton to Senator Jim Risch of Idaho, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, who has also demurred. Mr. Johnson has jumped right in. He and Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, the top Republican on the oversight panel, have traded congressional aides back and forth, the Wisconsin Republican said in a brief interview, and Mr. Jordan reached out to his office last week \u201cto give some details\u201d before more witnesses testified before the House Intelligence Committee. \u201cOne thing led to the other and it was kind of a natural progression of things,\u201d he said. At home, Mr. Johnson has cultivated a reputation as someone who will not back down from a fight. That reputation seeped through his letter on Monday, when he freely admitted to wincing after initially being told that Mr. Trump had linked the Ukrainian aid to investigations into his political rivals, and at times professed that his memory of certain conversations was blurry at best. Detailing a meeting he had with the president as well as with three impeachment witnesses in the Oval Office, including Gordon D. Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union, Mr. Johnson wrote that he was aware that Mr. Sondland testified that the president directed the delegation to work with his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani. But Mr. Johnson said that he had no such recollection. \u201cIt is entirely possible he did, but because I do not work for the president,\u201d he wrote, \u201cif made, that comment simply didn\u2019t register with me.\u201d",

      "content": " At their best, they were clever and unscripted. A timely comeback. A witty one-liner. At their worst, they were robotic and rambling. Clumsy. Cringe-worthy. Here are some of the most memorable moments from Wednesday\u2019s Democratic presidential debate in Atlanta, hosted by MSNBC and The Washington Post. Senator Kamala Harris of California said President Trump had compromised the checks and balances on North Korea\u2019s nuclear capabilities with his unilateral dealings with the country\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un. She said Mr. Trump was the greatest threat to the national security of the United States, pointing to his decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement and the Iran nuclear deal, as well as his decision to pull American troops from Northern Syria. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts opened the debate by saying Gordon D. Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union, had no qualifications other than his $1 million contribution to President Trump\u2019s inaugural committee. Ms. Warren said Mr. Sondland\u2019s testimony during an impeachment proceeding in the House of Representatives on Wednesday added to the mounting evidence that President Trump had tied foreign aid to Ukraine to an investigation of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s son. Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., said that Mr. Trump was not putting critical military resources into things like artificial intelligence for border security. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota avoided a direct attack on Mr. Buttigieg when asked about her comment that a woman with his credentials would not be doing as well as a candidate. But Ms. Klobuchar did not shrink from the moment of getting a point across that women candidates are treated differently. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey created a buzz with his dig at Mr. Biden, who recently said he opposed the legalization of marijuana. Mr. Booker said Mr. Biden\u2019s position on cannabis was at odds with the progressive wing of the Democratic Party and many black Americans, who he said have been disproportionately hurt by criminal charges related to marijuana. Andrew Yang, the former tech executive and entrepreneur, was asked what he would say to Vladimir Putin in their first conservation if elected president. Mr. Yang answered that he would tell the Russian president that his \u201cdays of meddling in American elections are over.\u201d Mr. Biden quipped about a recent swipe at him by Mr. Kim, as quoted by North Korean state media. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont then interjected, \u201cOther than that, you like him,\u201d which drew laughs from the candidates and audience. Mr. Biden used the wrong metaphor as a point of emphasis when asking what he would do to address the culture of violence toward women in the United States. He started his answer by urging Congress to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, which Mr. Biden championed when he was a member of the United States Senate. Mr. Biden, who has enjoyed strong polling numbers among black voters, rattled off a list of endorsements of prominent African-American lawmakers and said there was reason that his appeal transcended racial lines. But Mr. Biden flubbed the number of black women who have served in the Senate: there have been two. He was endorsed by former Senator Carol Moseley Braun of Illinois, the first black woman elected to the chamber. The second, Ms. Harris, was onstage to his left.",

      "author": "Eric Lipton",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump family\u2019s Doral resort, it turns out, will still be getting a chunk of new business next year, thanks to President Trump. The Republican National Committee confirmed that it was planning to return in January to the golf resort, formally known as the Trump National Doral Miami, for its winter meeting, which will pull in hundreds of guests, perhaps including the president himself. Mr. Trump had hoped to host the leaders of the Group of 7 \u2014 the world\u2019s largest economies \u2014 at the resort next year, but he gave up on the effort last month after the idea drew rebukes by both Democrats and Republicans, given that foreign governments would then be spending money at the resort. The Republican Party gathering will bring in much less revenue than the Group of 7 meeting, which had been expected to bring thousands of guests to the resort. The Republican National Committee visit is hardly surprising, as it has spent at least some money at the resort every year since Mr. Trump has been in office. Most of that spending came last year when it hosted a meeting that resulted $602,852 in payments to Trump Doral, according to Federal Election Commission reports. Michael Ahrens, a spokesman for the committee, said that the organization had three of these meetings each year and typically spent around the same amount. They are most often not held at Trump-family-owned venues, with recent locations including the Hyatt Regency Tamaya Resort in New Mexico, the Mayflower Hotel in Washington and the Westin Charlotte in North Carolina. \u201cThe media is obsessed with our spending at Trump properties and has covered it ad nauseam,\u201d Mr. Ahrens said in a statement. \u201cAs we have stated multiple times, we continue to hold events at them because they have fantastic service and secure spaces that fit our needs.\u201d Since Mr. Trump was elected, the Republican National Committee has been one of the biggest political spenders at his properties, including the Trump International Hotel in Washington, where it has spent nearly $450,000, federal records show. Over all, 192 political candidates or political groups have spent a combined $8.3 million at Trump businesses since the November 2016 election, according to a count by Public Citizen, a watchdog organization. Foreign governments, trade associations, lobbyists and religious groups have all held events at Trump-owned hotels or resorts, providing unspecified additional revenue to the company. This has helped the Trump hotels, which in some cases have seen declines in revenue. Mr. Trump has blamed at least part of the revenue declines on decisions by some travelers to stay away from his resorts because of political stands he has taken. \u201cDoral was setting records when I bought it because I owned it for a period of time. Setting records,\u201d Mr. Trump said last month. \u201cAnd then what happened? I announced I\u2019m going to run for office. Right? And all of a sudden \u2014 and I say, \u2018We got to build a wall, we got to have borders, we got to have this, we got to have that.\u2019 All of a sudden, people \u2014 some people didn\u2019t like it. They thought the rhetoric was too tough. And it went from doing great to doing fine.\u201d",

      "author": "Catie Edmondson",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 On the day of House Democrats\u2019 first public impeachment hearing into President Trump this week, as leaders of some of the conservative movement\u2019s most prominent organizations dialed into a briefing call hosted by the White House to coordinate their message, their activists were hard at work. The groups had sent out specific marching orders to the hundreds of thousands of members of their network: Follow and elevate these key Republican lawmakers on Twitter. Circulate these talking points among your friends and on social media. Call your elected officials and tell them not to support impeachment. Maybe most important: Donate now to support the cause. Some of the nation\u2019s leading conservative groups \u2014 the Club For Growth, FreedomWorks, Citizens United, and Tea Party Patriots \u2014 have locked arms to serve as an unofficial war room for the president during the impeachment inquiry, the third such proceeding in modern history, but the first of the social media age. The coalition of more than 100 organizations, including traditional conservative fund-raisers and public relations firms, is banking on a coordinated divide-and-conquer strategy that seeks to harness its grass-roots networks\u2019 outrage \u2014 and raise money crucial to its own survival. Organized by Jenny Beth Martin, a co-founder of Tea Party Patriots, the effort follows a familiar pattern in Washington, powered by the muscle memory of epic partisan fights of the past. Those include the battle over the Supreme Court confirmation of Brett M. Kavanaugh, and to a lesser extent, the confirmation of Neil M. Gorsuch, as well as the clash over the enactment of the Affordable Care Act. \u201cYou see that there is energy among the grass-roots donors and supporters of the president,\u201d David Bossie, the president of Citizens United, said in an interview. \u201cThe campaign, as well as outside groups who are helping the president, needs to utilize that \u2014 both to raise their voices as well as to raise revenue to continue the fight.\u201d The conservative movement, he added, \u201cis very good at coming together at important moments in time to make sure that we are putting all of the resources and intellectual firepower that we have in the most efficient manner possible.\u201d Each group has taken on a different front in the fight, coordinating through conference calls held multiple times a week. Some have flooded television sets and the internet with advertisements. Others have mobilized their followers into defending Mr. Trump on social media, while still others have encouraged their supporters to contact lawmakers and urge them to support the president. The Club For Growth has spent over $200,000 on advertisements, most of which upbraid politically vulnerable House Democrats for supporting the impeachment inquiry. They have also trained their fire on Republican lawmakers who have signaled an openness to impeachment. Last month, the group released polling showing that Representative Mark Amodei of Nevada, who said he supported the inquiry and then walked it back, would lose in a primary race. After Senator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, criticized the president for his conduct in the Ukraine affair, the group ran television ads in his home state, as well as nationally online, calling Mr. Romney a \u201cDemocrat secret asset\u201d who is \u201cplotting to take down President Trump with impeachment.\u201d \u201cThe goal there was to signal to him and to all the other Republicans on the Hill, that if you go that route, there is going to be a significant backlash,\u201d David McIntosh, the president of the Club for Growth, said in an interview. The ad, the group said, performed better than almost any of its other digital campaigns, prompting tens of thousands of new members to sign up. Leaders insist that their efforts are intended to bolster the White House\u2019s message, not to compensate for any void there, although Mr. Trump\u2019s team has often appeared to struggle to coalesce behind a communication strategy to confront the impeachment process. As often as twice a day, the groups dial in to background briefing conference calls hosted by the White House\u2019s Office of Public Liaison so that surrogates can stay attuned to talking points and ask questions. And on their own conference calls to internally coordinate, Republican congressional aides from both the House and Senate join the coalition\u2019s conference calls to brief participants on the view from Capitol Hill. Some of the groups entering the impeachment fray might appear to be unlikely defenders. The Club For Growth, for example, a powerful conservative group focused on economics, fiercely opposed Mr. Trump\u2019s bid for president in 2016. \u201cIt\u2019s a logical, obvious opportunistic reaction,\u201d Trevor Potter, the president of the Campaign Legal Center, a nonpartisan campaign finance organization, said in an interview, noting that both parties used emotionally charged, high-stakes moments to fund-raise. Whether the impeachment inquiry concludes with Mr. Trump still president, or Vice President Mike Pence, a traditional fiscal conservative, having ascended to the Oval Office, conservative groups see only upsides, Mr. Potter said. \u201cThey\u2019re not looking at the long-term outcome,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re saying, \u2018This is an opportunity to raise money.\u2019\u201d FreedomWorks, an organization focused on promoting limited government and lower taxes, has taken the lead on messaging on social media, serving as a rapid response channel. The Tea Party Patriots encourages Republican activists to join the \u201cTrump Defense Team,\u201d offering weekly action items that can include reading the memos assembled by congressional Republicans on the committees leading impeachment, following the Republican members of the Intelligence Committee on Twitter, and listening to the impeachment radio show hosted by Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump\u2019s former senior adviser. \u201cWe want to make sure that if people want to get in a discussion, they understand what the testimony is about,\u201d Ms. Martin said. \u201cThey have more than just what they\u2019re seeing in the news. It\u2019s important they understand what\u2019s going on and can read it firsthand.\u201d Local activists can then pass those talking points to their friends and use them in local editorials and social media outreach, she added. Many of the conservative groups that have joined the \u201cTrump Defense Team\u201d effort have a history of using politically charged debates as fund-raising tools, and several of them are doing so now. Activists are invited to sign a petition to declare their \u201cfull support\u201d for Mr. Trump and \u201creject Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats\u2019 efforts to overturn the free and fair presidential election.\u201d Signers are then prompted to donate to the group, \u201cso we can continue to push back against the Deranged Democrats.\u201d Ms. Martin did not disclose how much Tea Party Patriots had raised so far, but said that the average donation is $49, and is used to ensure the group\u2019s supporters receive the training and supplies they need to be active. \u201cIt is an effort to be helpful,\u201d Ms. Martin said. \u201cIt\u2019s not self-serving as much as it is making sure we are able to help all our volunteers across the entire conservative movement.\u201d Other members of the group are fund-raising consultants, such American Target Advertising, run by the conservative fund-raiser Richard Viguerie, and the Richard Norman Company, whose conservative clients have included the Family Research Council, which has challenged abortion laws in the United States. The Republican National Committee has its own effort to defend Mr. Trump that also heavily emphasizes fund-raising, which it is calling \u201cStop the Madness\u201d and the \u201cOfficial Impeachment Defense Task Force\u201d and offering a \u201cwallet-size card certifying your membership\u201d in exchange for a donation. \u201cThese Impeachment Hearings are a total SCAM!\u201d the Republican National Committee said in a tweet this week. \u201cThe President is calling on YOU to crush our goal of $3 MILLION in 24 hours. ALL DONATIONS WILL BE DOUBLE-MATCHED!\u201d Democratic political groups, like the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, are also raising money on impeachment, but the fund-raising pitches by Mr. Trump\u2019s side have been more explicit and involved a broader array of groups. Mr. Bossie recalled an adage by a conservative activist: \u201cYou can\u2019t save the world if you can\u2019t pay the rent. You have to raise the funds necessary to tell your story and send your message to the American people.\u201d His group, Citizens United, does not currently have a fund-raising component of their anti-impeachment efforts. \u201cThere should be,\u201d he said. Mr. McIntosh said the Club for Growth was seeing \u201ctremendous feedback from every level\u201d of participant in its organization, but in particular, activists outside Washington. \u201cWe\u2019re asking them to make calls to the offices. It\u2019s brought in a lot of new activists for the Club For Growth,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the donor level, we\u2019re seeing a response. \u2018How can I help, where do you need funds to execute this program?\u2019\u201d Mr. McIntosh said that he had heard initial concerns from \u201clongtime, loyalist donors\u201d who warned him not to forget that the group\u2019s mission is to bolster congressional candidates focused on cutting taxes and limited government. \u201cBut they get it,\u201d he added. \u201cIf the president is in trouble, it\u2019s hard to win those races.\u201d",

ShearPRINT EDITIONEnvoys Reveal Scope of Trump Ukraine Push |November 14, 2019, Page A1",
      "author": "Nicholas Fandos",
      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 The House of Representatives opened historic impeachment hearings on Wednesday and took startling new testimony from a senior American diplomat that further implicated President Trump in a campaign to pressure Ukraine to publicly commit to investigating former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. In a nationally televised hearing from a stately committee room across from the Capitol, William B. Taylor Jr., the top American diplomat in Ukraine, brought to life Democrats\u2019 allegations that Mr. Trump had abused his office by trying to enlist a foreign power to help him in an election. Mr. Taylor testified to the House Intelligence Committee that he learned only recently of a July telephone call overheard by one of his aides in which the president was preoccupied with Ukraine\u2019s willingness to say it would look into Mr. Biden and work by his son Hunter Biden for a Ukrainian energy firm. Immediately afterward, Mr. Taylor said, the aide had been informed that Mr. Trump cared more about \u201cinvestigations of Biden\u201d than he did about Ukraine. A powerful witness for Democrats, Mr. Taylor appeared as Congress embarked on the third set of presidential impeachment hearings in modern times. Forceful, detailed and unflappable in the face of Republican taunts, the veteran diplomat delivered a remarkable rebuke of the actions taken by the president and his allies inside and outside of the government who placed Mr. Trump\u2019s political objectives at the center of American policy toward Ukraine. \u201cSecurity was so important for Ukraine, as well as our own national interests,\u201d Mr. Taylor testified, describing his growing sense of alarm at learning that $391 million in vital military aid for the former Soviet republic had been held up. \u201cTo withhold that assistance for no good reason other than help with a political campaign made no sense. It was counterproductive to all of what we had been trying to do. It was illogical. It could not be explained. It was crazy.\u201d The proceedings pushed into the public gaze an epic impeachment clash between Mr. Trump, his Republican allies and Democrats that has shifted into high gear less than a year before the presidential election. In the first impeachment hearing in more than two decades, Mr. Taylor and another seasoned diplomat, George P. Kent, sketched out, in testimony by turns cinematic and dry, a tale of foreign policymaking distorted by a president\u2019s political vendettas with a small country facing Russian aggression caught in the middle. Democrats toiled to make their case to a deeply divided nation that Mr. Trump had put the integrity of the 2020 election at risk by withholding the security assistance for Ukraine\u2019s war with Russia to try to extract a political advantage for his re-election campaign. \u201cIf this is not impeachable conduct,\u201d demanded Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the chairman of the committee, \u201cwhat is?\u201d Showing no sign of doubts, Mr. Trump\u2019s Republican defenders raged against a process they called unfair and illegitimate. They dismissed Mr. Taylor and Mr. Kent \u2014 who between them have 70 years of experience as public servants under presidents of both parties \u2014 as part of a \u201cpoliticized bureaucracy\u201d who were offering nothing more than hearsay and supposition, rather than evidence of impeachable conduct. \u201cThe American people see through all this,\u201d said Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio. \u201cThey understand the facts support the president. They understand this process is unfair. And they see through the whole darn sham.\u201d At the White House on Wednesday, Mr. Trump sought to project an air of confidence in the face of an existential threat to his presidency. Before a working meeting with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, Mr. Trump told reporters of the hearing: \u201cIt\u2019s a hoax. I\u2019m too busy to watch it.\u201d But even so, Mr. Trump was busy all day retweeting allies defending him. His re-election campaign blasted out a fund-raising solicitation accusing Democrats of \u201cplaying a sick game.\u201d And the Republican National Committee circulated memes making fun of the witnesses as gossips who lacked firsthand information. Asked for his reaction after the hearing ended, Mr. Trump said he had heard \u201cit is a joke\u201d and insisted that he had not watched it \u201cfor one minute.\u201d He called the impeachment effort a sham and said, \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be allowed.\u201d Even as the public recitation of facts unfolded in the hearing room, there were signs that Democrats\u2019 investigation was still expanding. Investigators scheduled depositions with David Holmes, an official in the United States Embassy in Kiev, and Mark Sandy, of the Office of Management and Budget, for Friday and Saturday. According to an official involved in the inquiry, Mr. Holmes was the aide Mr. Taylor referred to in his new testimony, who told Mr. Taylor about Mr. Trump\u2019s singular interest in investigating the Bidens. Mr. Taylor said a member of his staff overheard a telephone conversation in which the president mentioned \u201cthe investigations\u201d to Gordon D. Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union, who then told Mr. Trump \u201cthat the Ukrainians were ready to move forward.\u201d The conversation took place in a restaurant in Kiev one day after the July 25 phone call in which Mr. Trump personally pressed President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to investigate the Bidens and unproven allegations that Ukraine conspired with Democrats to interfere in the 2016 election. When Mr. Holmes inquired after the call what the president thought about Ukraine, Mr. Sondland \u201cresponded that President Trump cares more about the investigations of Biden, which Giuliani was pressing for,\u201d in Mr. Taylor\u2019s telling. Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, led what Mr. Taylor called a \u201chighly irregular\u201d policymaking channel on Ukraine that ran counter to goals of longstanding American policy. The episode was not included in Mr. Taylor\u2019s interview with investigators last month because he was not aware of it at the time. But the new disclosure promises to figure prominently when Mr. Sondland appears next week for his own public testimony. Asked Wednesday afternoon about the call, Mr. Trump said, \u201cI know nothing about that.\u201d Standing beside Mr. Erdogan during a joint news conference at the White House, Mr. Trump pledged to release on Thursday a reconstructed transcript of another phone conversation he had with Mr. Zelensky, that one in April, additional evidence that the White House hopes can distract from the Democrats\u2019 case. The revelation came as Mr. Taylor recounted publicly what he had already told investigators privately. He said he had discovered that Mr. Trump was conditioning \u201ceverything\u201d about the United States\u2019 relationship with Ukraine \u2014 including needed military aid and a White House meeting for Ukraine\u2019s president \u2014 on the country\u2019s willingness to commit publicly to investigations of his political rivals. Mr. Taylor\u2019s testimony made it clear that the Ukrainians were well aware of the prerequisite at the time. Asked by a Democratic lawyer if he had ever seen \u201canother example of foreign aid conditioned on the personal or political interests of the president of the United States,\u201d Mr. Taylor, in a sonorous voice that echoed through the hearing room, said, \u201cI have not.\u201d In his opening statement, Mr. Kent said he had concluded by mid-August that Mr. Giuliani\u2019s efforts to pressure Mr. Zelensky to open investigations into Mr. Trump\u2019s rivals \u201cwere now infecting U.S. engagement with Ukraine, leveraging President Zelensky\u2019s desire for a White House meeting.\u201d Mr. Kent also assailed what he called a \u201ccampaign to smear\u201d American officials serving in Ukraine, which succeeded with the ouster of Marie L. Yovanovitch, the former United States ambassador there. \u201cIn my opinion, those attacks undermined U.S. and Ukrainian national interests and damaged our critical bilateral relationship,\u201d Mr. Kent said in his opening statement. Both witnesses forcefully rejected attempts by Republicans and Democrats to draw them into a partisan drama over the impeachment inquiry, declaring they are not \u201cNever Trumpers.\u201d Responding to Mr. Jordan\u2019s assertion that he was the star witness for the Democrats, Mr. Taylor insisted that he was not a political pawn of either party. \u201cI don\u2019t consider myself a star witness for anything,\u201d he said. \u201cI think I was clear I\u2019m not here to take one side or the other.\u201d And Mr. Taylor refused to take a position on whether Mr. Trump\u2019s actions were impeachable, telling Representative John Ratcliffe, Republican of Texas: \u201cThat is not what either of us are here for. This is your job.\u201d Even so, with the help of another nine public witnesses over the coming 10 days, Democrats hope to lay out a case that will capture the public\u2019s attention and convince a majority of Americans that Mr. Trump\u2019s actions are worthy of the Constitution\u2019s gravest reprimand: possible removal from office. \u201cI don\u2019t think President Trump was trying to end corruption in Ukraine,\u201d said Representative Jim Himes, Democrat of Connecticut. \u201cI think he was trying to aim corruption in Ukraine at Vice President Biden and at the 2020 election.\u201d Determined to seize what is plainly their best chance to capture the attention of the American public, Mr. Schiff, the committee\u2019s chairman, laid out the stakes. He invoked the words of Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, who defiantly told reporters to \u201cget over it\u201d when questioned about conditioning military aid to Ukraine to investigations Mr. Trump wanted. \u201cIf he sought to condition, coerce, extort or bribe an ally into conducting investigations to aid his re-election campaign, and did so by withholding official acts \u2014 a White House meeting or hundreds of millions of dollars of needed military aid \u2014 must we simply \u2018get over it\u2019?\u201d Mr. Schiff asked. \u201cIs this what Americans should now expect from their president?\u201d Mr. Schiff gaveled in Wednesday\u2019s hearing exactly 50 days after Speaker Nancy Pelosi opened the impeachment inquiry. The public hearings are a turning point for House Democrats from which they are unlikely to turn back. The Ukraine inquiry, after months of pursuit of Mr. Trump and years of Democratic agony over his flouting of political norms, now appears to have too much momentum to be turned back short of impeachment, even if it means muscling through a partisan vote akin to Republicans\u2019 impeachment of President Bill Clinton in 1998. Whether the inquiry has any chance of penetrating the intense partisan polarization that has gripped the country in recent years remains the central question for Democrats and Mr. Trump. Public polling suggests a slight majority of the country supports the inquiry, but Democratic leaders privately concede that given Mr. Trump\u2019s fervent base of support, almost no scenario could tip the country more decisively against him. Republicans cannot stop Democrats from impeaching Mr. Trump, but they are determined to ensure that any vote to do so is partisan. Their strategy is multipronged. It includes defending Mr. Trump\u2019s interest in Ukrainian corruption as legitimate, and portraying Democrats as desperate to find something, anything, to take out Mr. Trump. \u201cThe main performance, the Russia hoax, has ended, and you\u2019ve been cast in the low-rent Ukrainian sequel,\u201d said Representative Devin Nunes of California, the Intelligence Committee\u2019s top Republican, said Wednesday in an opening statement. He spoke of a \u201cpoliticized bureaucracy\u201d working against Mr. Trump, saying that diplomats in the State Department had worked to undercut the president. In the process, Mr. Nunes said, they had \u201clost the confidence of millions of Americans who believe that their vote should count for something.\u201d",

John Bel Edwards was called the \u201caccidental governor\u201d when he was first elected to lead Louisiana four years ago. After winning again, no one is calling him an accident now.By Rick Rojas and Jeremy AlfordPRINT EDITIONDemocrat Wins His Own Way in Louisiana|November 19, 2019, Page A16",
      "author": "Rick Rojas",
      "content": "  BATON ROUGE, La. \u2014 The first time that John Bel Edwards was elected to lead Louisiana, his critics derided him as the \u201caccidental governor.\u201d In their view, he won in 2015 only because the Republican front-runner had been hobbled by a tsunami of scandal and political misfortune. As his re-election bid geared up, once again the G.O.P. pegged him as vulnerable. The Republican Governors Association classified Louisiana as a \u201ctop pickup.\u201d But when Mr. Edwards, the only sitting Democratic governor in the Deep South, did it again on Saturday, this time overcoming not just his opponent but repeated appearances by President Trump, it was clear he was no fluke. Instead, he provided a glimpse of political shifts, however modest, in Louisiana and an intriguing case study for national Democrats, at a time when the party is engaged in serious soul-searching over whether to heed voices from the left or those closer to the center. Mr. Edwards combined a pro-gun, anti-abortion conservative social agenda with progressive stances on issues like Medicaid expansion and education, and a record of success in fixing a budget mess left behind by his Republican predecessor. That is not a model many Democrats are likely to replicate. But his success in attracting both black voters and centrist whites is widely viewed as a crucial lesson for Democratic candidates in the South and well beyond. As he entered the runoff election on Saturday against a Republican challenger, Eddie Rispone \u2014\u00a0a political newcomer who built his campaign almost entirely around his allegiance to President Trump \u2014\u00a0Mr. Edwards saw a surge of support, largely among African-American voters and white moderates living in and around cities. Twenty percent of the African-Americans who voted early in the runoff had not participated in the state\u2019s all-party primary, and there were considerable upticks in turnout around urban hubs like New Orleans and Baton Rouge. Mr. Edwards also drew support from voters who had backed the other Republican candidate in the primary. The race was, in many ways, a referendum on President Trump. Yet political analysts contend that the outcome was driven by more than just the president\u2019s strategy having backfired. Maddie Robinson, 42, had voted for Mr. Edwards\u2019s Republican predecessor, Bobby Jindal, and then turned to Mr. Edwards four year later, as the state struggled through budget shortfalls and slashed services. On Saturday, she voted for Mr. Edwards again. \u201cI do vote across party lines,\u201d Ms. Robinson said after casting her ballot in Baton Rouge, noting that Democratic candidates in the state often stick to a moderate path: \u201cThere are no Elizabeth Warrens running in Louisiana.\u201d The president\u2019s intense interest in the race, and his injection of national themes into it, appeared to have unintended consequences. State Representative Ted James, a Democrat from East Baton Rouge Parish, credited that as a force propelling black voters to the polls, describing the deep distrust many African-Americans have of Mr. Trump. \u201cThe folks I represent, that energized them,\u201d Mr. James said of the three trips Mr. Trump made to Louisiana to rally his supporters. Mr. Edwards, a West Point graduate, son of a sheriff, and former small-town lawyer from Amite, La., campaigned on achievements in office that carried the broadest appeal, like closing the state budget deficit and expanding Medicaid. His conservative credentials on guns and reproductive rights attracted voters who were wary of a leftward drift in the Democratic Party. He dismayed some in his own party with his support of a state law barring abortions, including in cases of rape and incest, at any time after the pulsing of what becomes the fetus\u2019s heart can be detected. Still, as Mr. Trump campaigned for Mr. Rispone, he tried to link Mr. Edwards to national Democrats and portray him as a far more liberal politician. Advertisements popping up during every commercial break on television accused Mr. Edwards of \u201cgiving millions to illegal immigrants,\u201d turning Louisiana into a \u201csanctuary city mecca\u201d and \u201creleasing dangerous criminals.\u201d Not everyone bought it. \u201cI had friends of mine who are Republicans, who were Trump supporters, but they voted for John Bel,\u201d said Kyle Green Jr., a former assistant state attorney general who was elected last month as a Democrat to the State House of Representatives. \u201cThe charges the Republican Party and Eddie Rispone and Donald Trump tried to lay on the governor and make stick didn\u2019t stick.\u201d Mr. Edwards received 51 percent of the vote in the runoff on Saturday, beating Mr. Rispone by about 40,000 votes in an election that had been considered a tossup. The runoff was necessary because Mr. Edwards failed to get an outright majority in the primary last month. Mr. Rispone, a Baton Rouge businessman, edged past a Republican congressman, Ralph Abraham, to advance to the runoff; Mr. Abraham later endorsed Mr. Rispone, but some of his supporters drifted to backing Mr. Edwards. On Saturday, Mr. Edwards notched significant increases in turnout compared to the primary. One congressional district, stretching roughly from Baton Rouge to New Orleans, had an increase of 42,000 voters for Mr. Edwards compared with the primary. \u201cThat was by far the biggest increase across the state,\u201d said J. Miles Coleman, the associate editor of Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball, a nonpartisan newsletter published by the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia. Political analysts said the results were indicative of a shift in Louisiana, as a divide that had once been between the state\u2019s north and south was now running between its rural and urban areas, mirroring what has happened elsewhere in the country. With that, cities and their suburbs have had more residents voting for Democrats. \u201cIn certain places, there is a slight blue-ing, and you can see it,\u201d said Roy Fletcher, a Republican political consultant in Louisiana. While the victory on Saturday thrilled Democrats, Mr. Fletcher cautioned that there was little about it that the party could replicate easily in other Southern states. \u201cIt was probably a better lesson for Republicans,\u201d he said: \u201cPick a better candidate.\u201d Mr. Rispone, a construction magnate who became a serious contender as more prominent Republicans declined to run, started with little name recognition. He let Mr. Trump dominate at rallies and in television advertisements. His stances on issues parroted Mr. Trump\u2019s. All the while, he remained a somewhat enigmatic figure. He rarely spoke to reporters, and avoided forums that were traditional staples of the governor\u2019s race, including one that should have been his home field, a gathering of business leaders in Baton Rouge. The Advocate newspaper in Baton Rouge reported that Mr. Edwards had the floor to himself at that gathering, telling the audience, \u201cIt speaks volumes that he doesn\u2019t have a vision to share about what this state ought to look like moving forward.\u201d \u201cThe unfortunate thing,\u201d Mr. James, the state representative, said, \u201cis that John Bel has had to work so hard to beat a guy like that.\u201d Even so, Mr. Edwards was already well known and relatively popular in the state. (The governor pointed out that it also did not hurt that the state\u2019s football teams had fared well lately.) Mr. Edwards first ran for governor as a state lawmaker, familiar to those in the state\u2019s political orbit but not much outside of it. His 2015 bid started as a go-big-or-go-home proposition that became a stunning success after the campaign of his Republican opponent, David Vitter, a United States senator at the time, combusted over a prostitution scandal and discord within his party. As governor, Mr. Edwards accepted invitations to the White House, eager to burnish his image with conservatives. And during his re-election campaign, he steadfastly steered clear of criticizing Mr. Trump. (In his victory speech, he deployed a familiar sugarcoated Southern put-down: \u201cAs for the president, God bless his heart!\u201d) John B. Breaux, a moderate Democrat who represented Louisiana for three terms in the Senate, said the governor had an independent streak that appealed to moderate voters, showing that he could either work with or challenge the Trump administration, depending on what was best for Louisiana. \u201cSome of these people are like puppets,\u201d Mr. Breaux, who left the Senate in 2005, said. \u201cTrump says jump and they say how high. That\u2019s not what Louisiana wants.\u201d In a boisterous victory lap on Saturday night that started with a prayer and expressions of thanks to his family, Mr. Edwards used his speech to address issues where he was in line with Democrats outside Louisiana. He pledged to bolster spending on education and health care. He said the state\u2019s minimum wage, $7.25, was woefully insufficient. He also called for equal pay for men and women. He made a case that his victory was more than a rebuke of Mr. Trump. \u201cYou know, here in Louisiana, we march to the beat of our own second line,\u201d he told the crowd, surrounded by his family and supporters. \u201cWe are rich in culture, natural resources and diversity. It\u2019s what makes our great state. And tonight, the people of Louisiana have chosen to chart their own path.\u201d",

      "author": "Adam Liptak",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump asked the Supreme Court on Thursday to bar his accounting firm from turning over eight years of his tax returns to Manhattan prosecutors. The case, the first concerning Mr. Trump\u2019s personal conduct and business dealings to reach the court, could yield a major ruling on the scope of presidential immunity from criminal investigations. Jay Sekulow, a lawyer for Mr. Trump, said a federal appeals court had committed a grave legal error in allowing the accounting firm to provide the tax records. \u201cWe are hopeful that the Supreme Court will grant review in this significant constitutional case and reverse the dangerous and damaging decision of the appeals court,\u201d Mr. Sekulow said in a statement. In their petition urging the Supreme Court to hear their appeal, Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers argued that he was immune from all criminal proceedings and investigations so long as he remained in office. But even if some federal investigations may be proper, the petition said, the Supreme Court should rule that state and local prosecutors may not seek information about a sitting president\u2019s conduct. \u201cThat the Constitution would empower thousands of state and local prosecutors to embroil the president in criminal proceedings is unimaginable,\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers wrote. Much of the petition was devoted to a plea that the justices hear the case. If they turn it down, the accounting firm has indicated that it will supply the requested records. Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers noted that the Supreme Court heard cases concerning claims of immunity from Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Bill Clinton. \u201cThe court should do the same here,\u201d the petition said. \u201cWhether the Constitution permits an assertion of this kind of authority over the chief executive raises a momentous question of first impression about the scope of presidential immunity.\u201d In the two earlier cases, United States v. Nixon in 1974 and Clinton v. Jones in 1997, both presidents suffered unanimous losses. Last week, a unanimous three-judge panel of a federal appeals court in Manhattan ruled against Mr. Trump. The court, in a focused ruling, said state prosecutors may require third parties to turn over a sitting president\u2019s financial records for use in a grand jury investigation. Mr. Trump has fought vigorously to shield his financial records, and prosecutors in Manhattan have agreed not to seek the tax returns until the case is resolved by the Supreme Court. In exchange, they insisted on a very quick briefing schedule, one that would allow the court to announce whether it would hear the case as soon as next month and to issue a decision by June, as the presidential election enters its final stages. Other cases involving Mr. Trump are also in the pipeline. They involve matters as diverse as demands from House Democrats for tax and business records, a request for access to redacted portions of the report prepared by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, and challenges to Mr. Trump\u2019s business arrangements under the Constitution\u2019s emoluments clauses. On Wednesday, the full United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit refused to rehear a ruling from a divided three-judge panel that Mr. Trump\u2019s accounting firm must comply with the House Oversight and Reform Committee\u2019s demands for eight years of his financial records. A lawyer for Mr. Trump said he would appeal that ruling to the Supreme Court, too. The legal fight in the New York case began in late August after prosecutors in the office of the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., a Democrat, subpoenaed Mr. Trump\u2019s accounting firm, Mazars USA, for his tax returns and those of his family business dating to 2011. In Thursday\u2019s filing, Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers called that move unprecedented. \u201cFor the first time in our nation\u2019s history,\u201d they wrote, \u201ca state or local prosecutor has launched a criminal investigation of the president of the United States and subjected him to coercive criminal process.\u201d The petition said the subpoena was \u201cpolitically motivated\u201d and sought information that was not relevant to any legitimate criminal inquiry. \u201cThe practical threat that state criminal process poses to a president cannot be overstated,\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers wrote. \u201cState and local prosecutors have massive incentives to target him with investigations and subpoenas to advance their careers, enhance their re-election prospects or make a political statement.\u201d The Manhattan prosecutors are looking into hush-money payments made to two women just before the 2016 presidential election. Mr. Trump and his company, the Trump Organization, reimbursed his former lawyer and fixer, Michael D. Cohen, for payments he made to the adult film actress Stormy Daniels, who claimed she had an affair with Mr. Trump. Mr. Cohen was also involved in money paid to Karen McDougal, a Playboy model who also said she had a relationship with Mr. Trump. The president has denied the relationships. Prosecutors say they need the documents to decide whether the payments violated state laws. Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers told the Supreme Court that at least some of the requested documents had nothing to do with Mr. Vance\u2019s investigation. \u201cThe grand jury subpoena to Mazars,\u201d they wrote, \u201cis not tailored to the 2016 payments and business records he claims to be investigating. It seeks reams of the President\u2019s confidential information, reaches back to 2011, and asks for documents \u2014 like those relating to a hotel in Washington, D.C. \u2014 that have nothing to do with New York.\u201d Mr. Vance\u2019s office, the petition said, \u201cjust photocopied congressional subpoenas relating to federal issues that New York County has no authority to investigate, and sent it to Mazars.\u201d A spokesman for Mr. Vance declined to comment on Thursday\u2019s filing beyond saying that his office planned to file a brief opposing Supreme Court review next week. In September, Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers sued to block the subpoena, arguing that criminal investigations of presidents are barred by the Constitution. They said sitting presidents are not only protected from being indicted, a proposition that is widely but not universally accepted, but also cannot be subjected to the burdens of criminal investigations, especially from local prosecutors who may use the criminal process for political gain. When the case was argued last month before the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, Judge Denny Chin asked about a statement Mr. Trump had once made \u2014 that he could stand on Fifth Avenue and shoot someone without political fallout. Judge Chin asked William S. Consovoy, a lawyer for Mr. Trump, about the legal consequences of such a hypothetical crime. \u201cLocal authorities couldn\u2019t investigate?\u201d Judge Chin asked, adding: \u201cNothing could be done? That\u2019s your position?\u201d \u201cThat is correct,\u201d Mr. Consovoy said. \u201cThat is correct.\u201d In a footnote to last week\u2019s decision, Chief Judge Robert A. Katzmann, writing for the appeals court panel, said allowing a grand jury to inspect tax returns did not seem likely to impose a burden on Mr. Trump\u2019s ability to fulfill his constitutional responsibilities. \u201cWe note that the past six presidents, dating back to President Carter, all voluntarily released their tax returns to the public,\u201d Judge Katzmann wrote. \u201cWhile we do not place dispositive weight on this fact, it reinforces our conclusion that the disclosure of personal financial information, standing alone, is unlikely to impair the president in performing the duties of his office.\u201d Judge Katzmann noted that Mr. Trump had conceded that his immunity would last only as long as he held office. \u201cThere is no obvious reason why a state could not begin to investigate a president during his term and, with the information secured during that search, ultimately determine to prosecute him after he leaves office,\u201d he wrote. On Thursday, Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers wrote that the proper way to address any misconduct by a sitting president is through impeachment proceedings. \u201cAllowing a single prosecutor to investigate a sitting president through the issuance of criminal process no less invades Congress\u2019s impeachment authority than the filing of a criminal charge,\u201d they wrote.",

      "author": "Dave Philipps",
      "content": " [Update: President Trump on Thursday reversed a Navy decision to oust Edward Gallagher from SEALs.] The Navy SEAL at the center of a high-profile war crimes case has been ordered to appear before Navy leaders Wednesday morning, and is expected to be notified that the Navy intends to oust him from the elite commando force, two Navy officials said on Tuesday. The move could put the SEAL commander, Rear Adm. Collin Green, in direct conflict with President Trump, who last week cleared the sailor, Chief Petty Officer Edward Gallagher, of any judicial punishment in the war crimes case. Military leaders opposed that action as well as Mr. Trump\u2019s pardons of two soldiers involved in other murder cases. Navy officials had planned to begin the process of taking away Chief Gallagher\u2019s Trident pin, the symbol of his membership in the SEALs, earlier this month. But as he waited outside his commander\u2019s office, Navy leaders sought clearance from the White House that never came, and no action was taken. Admiral Green now has the authorization he needs from the Navy to act against Chief Gallagher, and the formal letter notifying the chief of the action has been drafted by the admiral, the two officials said. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the impending action. The Navy also plans to take the Tridents of three SEAL officers who oversaw Chief Gallagher \u2014 Lt. Cmdr. Robert Breisch, Lt. Jacob Portier and Lt. Thomas MacNeil \u2014\u00a0and their letters have been drafted as well, one of the officials said. Under Navy regulations, a SEAL\u2019s Trident can be taken if a commander loses \u201cfaith and confidence in the service member\u2019s ability to exercise sound judgment, reliability and personal conduct.\u201d The Navy has removed 154 Tridents since 2011. Removing a Trident does not entail a reduction in rank, but it effectively ends a SEAL\u2019s career. Since Chief Gallagher and Lieutenant Portier both planned to leave the Navy soon in any case, the step would have little practical effect on them. But in a warrior culture that prizes honor and prestige, the rebuke would still cast the men out of a tight-knit brotherhood. \u201cTo have a commander remove that pin after a guy has gone through so much to earn it, it is pretty much the worst thing you could do,\u201d said Eric Deming, a retired senior chief who served 19 years in the SEALs. \u201cYou are having your whole identity taken away.\u201d \u201cWhy would they do it to someone like Gallagher?\u201d said Mr. Deming, who is not involved in the case. \u201cI think the leadership feels like they have lost the trust of the American people and want to rebuild it. So they are trying to show guys will be held accountable.\u201d [Sign up for the weekly At War newsletter to receive articles about duty, conflict and consequence.] The move sets up a potential confrontation between Mr. Trump, who has repeatedly championed Chief Gallagher, and Admiral Green, who has said he intends to overhaul discipline and ethics in the SEAL teams and sees Chief Gallagher\u2019s behavior as an obstacle. One Navy official who spoke about the specifics of the action said the admiral was making the move knowing that it could end his career, but that he had the backing of Adm. Michael M. Gilday, the chief of naval operations, and Richard V. Spencer, the secretary of the Navy. Asked about Admiral Gilday, his spokesman, Cmdr. Nate Christensen, said on Tuesday that the admiral \u201csupports his commanders in executing their roles, to include Rear Admiral Green.\u201d Chief Gallagher\u2019s lawyer, Timothy Parlatore, said that punishing the chief after the president cleared him last week would amount to insubordination. \u201cDoes Admiral Green have the authority to do it? Yes,\u201d Mr. Parlatore said in a telephone interview. \u201cBut how tone-deaf is the guy? The commander in chief\u2019s intent is crystal clear, that he wants Eddie left alone.\u201d Mr. Parlatore said he expected Mr. Trump to order the Navy to restore Chief Gallagher\u2019s Trident if it is removed, and to dismiss Admiral Green from command. Chief Gallagher has been at the center of a whipsaw war crimes case for more than a year. He was arrested and jailed in 2018 on war-crimes charges including shooting unarmed civilians in Iraq and killing a wounded teenage captive with a hunting knife. A military jury acquitted him in July of all the charges except a minor one of posing for a trophy photo with the captive\u2019s corpse; for that crime, he was demoted and faced the possibility of further sanctions. Mr. Trump restored his rank on Friday. \u201cI had a feeling that it was coming because, you know, the president has shown the nation he was a man of his word,\u201d Chief Gallagher said in an interview on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cHe knew a lot about all the injustices that went on through this whole ordeal I went through.\u201d Navy officials contend that, independent of the criminal charges, Chief Gallagher\u2019s behavior during and since the deployment has fallen below the standard of the SEALs. A Navy investigation uncovered evidence that he had been buying and using narcotics. Since his acquittal, Chief Gallagher has trolled the Navy on social media, taunting the SEALs who testified against him; mocking one who wept as he told investigators about witnessing the stabbing of the captive; insulting the Naval Criminal Investigative Service; and calling top SEAL commanders, including Admiral Green, \u201ca bunch of morons.\u201d The cases of Chief Gallagher and the three officers will be submitted to a review board, who will decide whether to follow the admiral\u2019s recommendation that they be ejected from the force. The process, which can take several weeks, almost always results in the SEAL\u2019s Trident being taken, according to Patrick Korody, a former Navy prosecutor. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anyone beat it,\u201d he said. \u201cIn cases like this, I don\u2019t know if you could find anyone who would go against the admiral\u2019s recommendation.\u201d For all four men, the review board\u2019s decision is likely to center on the allegations that Chief Gallagher committed murder during a 2017 deployment to Iraq. In court testimony, multiple SEALs in his platoon said that they reported one killing the day it happened, and several times after that as well, but that the platoon commander, Lieutenant Portier, did not forward the report up the chain of command as required by regulations. Lieutenant Portier was criminally charged with failing to report the murder; he denied the charges, and they were dropped after Chief Gallagher was acquitted. Commander Breisch was the troop commander over Chief Gallagher and Lieutenant Portier in Iraq. SEALs in the platoon testified that they told him repeatedly about the killings after the deployment, but were told to \u201cdecompress\u201d and \u201clet it go,\u201d according to a Navy investigation. Commander Breisch was not charged. Lieutenant MacNeil was the most junior officer in the platoon, and was one of the SEALs who reported Chief Gallagher for murder and testified at his trial. During the proceedings, though, it was revealed that Lieutenant MacNeil had done nothing to stop the chief from posing for a trophy photo with the head of the dead teenage captive he was accused of stabbing, and had posed for the photo as well. At trial it was also revealed that Lieutenant MacNeil had been drinking with enlisted SEALs in Iraq, in violation of regulations. The president has the authority to stop or reverse any decision concerning the SEALs\u2019 Tridents, according to Eugene R. Fidell, who teaches military justice at Yale Law School. But for generations, he said, presidents have generally refrained from inserting themselves into the military\u2019s personnel decisions. \u201cThe president is the commander in chief; he could give orders about how to peel the potatoes in the chow hall if he wanted,\u201d Mr. Fidell said. \u201cThe question is, should he?\u201d Regarding Chief Gallagher\u2019s Trident, he said: \u201cA reasonable observer could say this is a completely inappropriate intrusion into the military. If Trump saves his Trident \u2014 and I\u2019d bet on it \u2014 I would say he will have driven the wedge ever deeper into an already divided military. And that can\u2019t be helpful.\u201d",

      "author": "Maggie Haberman",
      "content": "   The secretary of the Navy and the admiral who leads the SEALs have threatened to resign or be fired if plans to expel a commando from the elite unit in a war crimes case are halted by President Trump, administration officials said Saturday. The high-level pushback to Mr. Trump\u2019s unambiguous assertion on Twitter this past week that the commando, Chief Petty Officer Edward Gallagher, should remain in the unit was an extraordinary development in what was already an extraordinary case, one with few precedents in the history of presidential relations with the American military. The Navy secretary, Richard V. Spencer, later denied that he had threatened to resign but said disciplinary plans against Chief Gallagher would proceed because he did not consider Mr. Trump\u2019s statement on Twitter to be a formal order. Mr. Spencer added that the president, as commander in chief, had the authority to intervene and that it would stop \u201cthe process.\u201d Chief Gallagher, who counts Mr. Trump as one of his most vocal supporters, was accused of shooting civilians, murdering a captive Islamic State fighter with a hunting knife in Iraq, and threatening to kill SEALs who reported him, among other misconduct. His court-martial ended in acquittal on those charges. But the Navy ultimately demoted the chief, who was convicted of one charge: bringing discredit to the armed forces by posing for photos with the teenage captive\u2019s dead body. Last Friday, Mr. Trump reversed that demotion, angering Navy officials, including the commander of the SEALs, Rear Adm. Collin Green, who had little choice but to accept the reversal. Nonetheless, they continued with their plans to eject Chief Gallagher from the unit. On Thursday, the president intervened again in the case, saying that the commando should not be ousted. Referring to the pin that signifies membership in the SEALs, Mr. Trump said on Twitter that \u201cThe Navy will NOT be taking away Warfighter and Navy Seal Eddie Gallagher\u2019s Trident Pin.\u201d He added: \u201cThis case was handled very badly from the beginning. Get back to business!\u201d One argument that officials said the Pentagon is relying on is the assumption that a tweet does not constitute a formal presidential order. Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper and General Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, conveyed to the president that if he followed up that tweet with a direct order, there would be huge consequences: Mr. Trump would lose Mr. Spencer and Admiral Green, further infuriate his top military leadership and do untold damage to decades of military justice doctrine, according to administration officials. On Saturday, Mr. Spencer denied that he had threatened to step down. \u201cContrary to popular belief, I am still here,\u201d he said during a panel discussion at a security conference in Halifax, Nova Scotia. \u201cI did not threaten to resign. But let us just say we are here to talk about external threats, and Eddie Gallagher is not one of them.\u201d Mr. Esper and General Milley had scrambled to come up with a face-saving compromise this past week in a bid to persuade Mr. Trump to change his mind. Administration officials said they now hoped that Mr. Trump would allow the proceedings to continue, but it is unclear whether the president will do so. The debate over Chief Gallagher comes as Mr. Trump, facing a difficult re-election battle and an impeachment inquiry, has increasingly sought to highlight his role as commander in chief. Since 2011, the Navy has revoked more than 150 Trident pins. For Chief Gallagher to lose his, a peer-review board composed of one SEAL officer and four senior enlisted SEALs must first review evidence to determine his status. Chief Gallagher can speak to the board but must do so without his lawyers, a Defense Department official said. He can call witnesses, and he can appeal the final decision of the board if it goes against him. Chief Gallagher\u2019s lawyer, Timothy Parlatore, said the president was right to stop the process of ousting the commando, calling the Navy\u2019s move clear retribution just days after the president\u2019s decision to restore his rank. \u201cWith the timing, it\u2019s difficult to see how this was anything but a direct, public rebuke to the president,\u201d Mr. Parlatore said. \u201cSo I can\u2019t see how the secretary of defense or anyone else is going to convince the president that is O.K.\u201d There is precedent for presidents intervening in military justice matters. John F. Kennedy stopped the punishment of an Army Reserve soldier who was court-martialed for bad-mouthing him. Abraham Lincoln infuriated some of his generals by regularly combing through court-martial orders for Union troops who were charged with desertion and other crimes and scrawling impromptu one-line orders for leniency, like \u201cLet him fight instead of being shot.\u201d But experts say the constitutional arrangement of civilian control over the military can become strained when a president disregards the counsel of generals and admirals, or never seeks it in the first place. On Friday, Mr. Spencer made clear that he wanted to move forward with the proceedings. \u201cI believe the process matters for good order and discipline,\u201d he told Reuters in an interview at the security forum in Nova Scotia. On Saturday, a Navy spokesman pointed to that statement. \u201cThe secretary\u2019s comments are in line with current White House guidance,\u201d said Rear Adm. Charlie Brown, the chief spokesman for the Navy. Mr. Spencer expanded on his remarks at the security forum during a separate discussion on Saturday with reporters. The military does not consider a tweet to be an official order, he said, but if he received an official order from Mr. Trump, it would be obeyed. \u201cIf the president requests to stop the process, the process stops,\u201d Mr. Spencer said. \u201cGood order and discipline is also obeying orders from the president of the United States.\u201d It was unclear from his comments whether he would stay in his post if the president were to issue a formal order. A White House spokesman did not respond to requests for comment. The gold insignia Trident pin is one of the most revered in the military. It features an eagle on an anchor, clutching a flintlock pistol and a trident, and represents the grit of sailors who made it through some of the toughest training in the Navy, and are given some of the riskiest missions. It stands for fidelity and sacrifice. Even in death, the pin plays a role: SEALs pound their pins into the wood of fallen comrades\u2019 caskets. The Pentagon had already been quietly fuming this month after Mr. Trump cleared three members of the armed services, including Chief Gallagher, who were accused or had been convicted of war crimes, overruling military leaders who sought to punish them. All three were lionized by conservative commentators who portrayed them as war heroes unfairly prosecuted for actions taken in the heat of battle. Mr. Trump, who was lobbied heavily by the families of the three service members, announced last Friday that he was reversing the demotion of Chief Gallagher. He also ordered the full pardon of Clint Lorance, a former Army lieutenant who was serving a 19-year sentence in a military prison at Fort Leavenworth for the murder of two civilians; and of Maj. Mathew L. Golsteyn, an Army Special Forces officer who was facing murder charges for killing an unarmed Afghan he believed was a Taliban bomb maker. One of the jurors who convicted Chief Gallagher expressed dismay at the president\u2019s actions in an interview on Friday, noting that the all-military jury had given Chief Gallagher the maximum punishment allowable under the law because it found his behavior so reprehensible. He spoke out for the first time to defend the decision of the jury. \u201cPeople keep saying all he did is pose in a photo and there were lots of other guys in the photo,\u201d said the juror, who asked that his name not be used to protect the privacy of the deliberations. \u201cBut he was the senior enlisted guy there, the oldest, the most experienced. He should have set an example for good order and discipline. He should have ensured stuff like that wasn\u2019t happening. And he didn\u2019t. He doesn\u2019t deserve to wear chief\u2019s anchors.\u201d The juror said he hoped the Trident review process would be allowed to go forward, adding, \u201cLet other SEALs decide if he deserves to be a SEAL.\u201d",

SchmidtPRINT EDITIONPelosi Suggests Trump May Face Bribery Charge|November 15, 2019, Page A1",
      "author": "Nicholas Fandos",
      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 Speaker Nancy Pelosi sharpened the focus of Democrats\u2019 impeachment case against President Trump on Thursday, accusing the president of committing bribery when he withheld vital military assistance from Ukraine at the same time he was seeking its commitment to publicly investigate his political rivals. The speaker\u2019s explicit allegation of bribery, a misdeed identified in the Constitution as an impeachable offense, was significant. Even as Ms. Pelosi said that no final decision had been made on whether to impeach Mr. Trump, it suggested that Democrats were moving toward a more specific set of charges that could be codified in articles of impeachment in the coming weeks. It also indicated that Democrats were working to put a simple name to the president\u2019s alleged wrongdoing that would resonate with the public. \u201cThe devastating testimony corroborated evidence of bribery uncovered in the inquiry, and that the president abused his power and violated his oath by threatening to withhold military aid and a White House meeting in exchange for an investigation into his political rival \u2014 a clear attempt by the president to give himself an advantage in the 2020 election,\u201d Ms. Pelosi told reporters at her weekly news conference in the Capitol. The remarks came as impeachment investigators closed in on two potentially significant breakthroughs that could help build their case. A second witness emerged to corroborate a key episode revealed during public impeachment testimony on Wednesday that further tied Mr. Trump to the pressure campaign on Ukraine. The account of a telephone call in which the president discussed his interest in having Ukraine begin investigations will help bolster Democrats\u2019 case against Mr. Trump, but it could also undercut the credibility of their best witness who can describe direct conversations with the president. Later Thursday, a high-ranking career official appeared poised to become the first witness to cooperate with the inquiry from the White House Office of Management and Budget, which played a key role in holding up the delivery of $391 million in security assistance at the center of the inquiry. A lawyer for the official, Mark Sandy, said that he would appear for a deposition on Saturday if subpoenaed, despite orders from the White House not to. Mr. Trump worked to defend himself and shore up his support among Republicans who could decide the fate of his presidency. Over lunch at the White House, he showed a group of Republican senators a reconstructed transcript of a congratulatory phone conversation he had in April with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. Mr. Trump has promised repeatedly to release the document, in part to counter the notion that he ever pressured Mr. Zelensky, but by Thursday evening it had not been made public. \u201cHe just shuffled it across the table,\u201d Senator Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, who attended the lunch, told reporters afterward, calling the conversation \u201ca very nice, congratulatory call.\u201d \u201cIt said \u2018Congratulations, you ran a great campaign.\u2019 \u2018Oh, thank you, Mr. President, look forward to working with you,\u2019\u201d Mr. Cramer said. The president\u2019s thinking seemed to be that the congratulatory April call might draw attention away from his July exchange with Mr. Zelensky in which he pressed the Ukrainian president to investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and a discredited theory about Democrats conspiring with Ukraine to interfere in the 2016 election. Democrats consider a reconstructed transcript of that call their most damning evidence against Mr. Trump. The House Intelligence Committee plans to convene another impeachment hearing on Friday, calling Marie L. Yovanovitch, the former American ambassador to Ukraine whose ouster by Mr. Trump, some members say, set the stage for his pressure campaign. The Intelligence Committee convened the House\u2019s first public impeachment hearing in two decades on Wednesday with testimony from William B. Taylor Jr., the top American diplomat in Ukraine, and George P. Kent, a senior State Department official responsible for policy toward the country. They told the committee that Mr. Trump and his allies inside and outside the government placed the president\u2019s political objectives at the center of American policy toward Ukraine, using as leverage both the security assistance that Congress had appropriated for Ukraine\u2019s war with Russia as well as a White House meeting that was coveted by the country\u2019s new leader. The new witness who emerged on Thursday, Suriya Jayanti, a State Department official in Kiev, would be able to describe a phone call she overheard between the president and Gordon D. Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union, in which they discussed the investigations Mr. Trump sought. Ms. Jayanti sat at a restaurant with Mr. Sondland and at least one other embassy official, David Holmes, as Mr. Sondland and Mr. Trump spoke by phone in July, according to two people briefed on the matter. During that call, Mr. Trump brought up the investigations he sought and Mr. Sondland said the Ukrainians were prepared to move forward with them. After the call, Mr. Sondland told at least Mr. Holmes that Mr. Trump cared more about the investigations his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani had been pushing the Ukranians to commit to than about Ukraine. The conversation took place just a day after the July 25 phone call in which Mr. Trump raised the investigations with Mr. Zelensky. Mr. Taylor first disclosed the existence of the call during his testimony on Wednesday. Investigators plan to interview Mr. Holmes privately on Friday to press for additional details. They may also ask Ms. Jayanti to testify. Though her account bolsters Democrats\u2019 accusations, it raises new questions about the credibility of Mr. Sondland, who is scheduled to testify publicly next week. Because the White House has blocked other officials from cooperating, Mr. Sondland is one of the few witnesses who spoke directly with Mr. Trump and is therefore important to Democrats\u2019 case. But he already substantially revised his testimony once, admitting that he told a top Ukrainian official in September that the country would probably not receive military aid unless it announced the investigations that Mr. Trump wanted. Now it has become clear that he also failed to disclose to the committee the July call he had with Mr. Trump. Republicans pounced on the inconsistencies to try to discredit Mr. Sondland, a wealthy hotelier and Trump campaign donor who had no diplomatic experience before the president installed him as an ambassador. \u201cI think that if Ambassador Sondland\u2019s credibility is questioned, it makes it really hard for the Democrats to impeach, because everything is based on Ambassador Sondland,\u201d said Representative Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina. During a rally on Thursday night in Louisiana, Mr. Trump appeared to be trying to do just that. He read aloud from a news article that included new remarks by Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister, Vadym Prystaiko, who said Mr. Sondland had never told him or other officials he knew of a connection between the military aid and the investigations. \u201cCan you believe? Like we need help to beat sleepy Joe Biden,\u201d Mr. Trump said. The Interfax-Ukraine news agency first reported Mr. Prystaiko\u2019s remarks. Mr. Sondland, though, never claimed to have discussed the matter with the foreign minister. He said he had told another Ukrainian official who is close to Mr. Zelensky, Andriy Yermak, of the link. Democrats have not exactly been forgiving, either, but they argue that Republicans are overstating the implications for the case they are building, particularly if Mr. Sondland confirms the new details. \u201cObviously it doesn\u2019t help his credibility,\u201d said Representative Sean Patrick Maloney, Democrat of New York. \u201cBut no one can dispute he is a person with important information who was at the center of these events, a firsthand witness to the president\u2019s actions. All we want from Ambassador Sondland is the whole truth, and nothing but.\u201d Rank-and-file Democrats have begun using the term \u201cbribery\u201d more freely in recent days to describe what a string of diplomats and career Trump administration officials have said was a highly unusual and inappropriate effort by Mr. Trump and a small group around him to extract a public promise from Ukraine for investigations. But Ms. Pelosi\u2019s remarks on impeachment were the first time she discussed the growing inquiry at length with reporters since Congress recessed in late October. \u201cThe bribe is to grant or withhold military assistance in return for a public statement of a fake investigation into the elections,\u201d Ms. Pelosi said, clarifying her choice of words. \u201cThat\u2019s bribery.\u201d Ms. Pelosi was referring to Article II of the Constitution, which states that the president and other public officers \u201cshall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.\u201d The founders, who were preoccupied with the young republic\u2019s independence from foreign influence, included the term to ensure the president was acting in the interest of the United States. \u201cThe framers had this concept of an illicit exchange, the president using his power in exchange for something that was beneficial for him, and perhaps vice versa,\u201d said Michael J. Gerhardt, a constitutional law professor and an impeachment scholar at the University of North Carolina. For Democrats, the term may also help solve a communications challenge. After weeks of describing the president\u2019s actions as a \u201cquid pro quo,\u201d lawmakers are looking for a more straightforward and digestible way to describe what happened to their constituents. \u201cEnglish words are easier to understand than Latin words,\u201d said Representative Jim Himes, Democrat of Connecticut. Asked if Democrats were successfully bringing the public along with them, Ms. Pelosi conceded that the country was likely too polarized to ever support impeachment as overwhelmingly as it did when President Richard M. Nixon resigned in 1974. Public opinion polls now suggest a majority of Americans favor the impeachment inquiry, but only by a thin margin. \u201cImpeaching is a divisive thing in our country \u2014 it\u2019s hard,\u201d Ms. Pelosi said. \u201cThe place that our country is now, it\u2019s not a time where you\u2019ll go to 70 percent when President Nixon walked out of the White House.\u201d Indeed, there was no sign from congressional Republicans that the testimony had shaken their conviction that Mr. Trump is innocent. Representative Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California and the minority leader, told reporters that the hearing had only confirmed that the accounts from Mr. Taylor, Mr. Kent and other witnesses who have offered damaging information about Mr. Trump are not firsthand, and therefore could not be trusted. And he pointed to the July phone call between Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky that is at the heart of the impeachment inquiry as exculpatory, despite Democrats\u2019 claims to the contrary. \u201cThe call summary is still the most important piece of evidence we have, and it shows no pressure or even mention of conditionality between the two leaders,\u201d Mr. McCarthy said. In an interview, he added that he did not put much stock in Ms. Pelosi\u2019s use of the term \u201cbribery\u201d either. \u201cWait \u2019til tomorrow \u2019til she makes a new term, because every term she brings forward, there\u2019s no proof behind it,\u201d he said.",

      "content": " BOSSIER CITY, La. \u2014 President Trump urged Louisiana voters on Thursday to \u201csend a message to the corrupt Democrats in Washington\u201d by electing to governor the Republican nominee, Eddie Rispone, directly linking the impeachment inquiry to a state election that will test his clout in the Deep South. Addressing supporters at his second rally in two weeks in heavily Republican north Louisiana, and his first since Democrats began public impeachment hearings, Mr. Trump dutifully read from his prepared text in an effort to rouse conservatives ahead of Saturday\u2019s election. \u201cYou will deliver a powerful rebuke to the socialists trying to demolish our democracy,\u201d he told an arena full of enthusiasts here along the Red River. But he also let slip his more personal interest in the Louisiana election, where Gov. John Bel Edwards is seeking re-election, by recalling negative headlines he had received this month in another race. Gov. Matt Bevin of Kentucky, a Republican, lost his re-election a day after Mr. Trump rallied supporters in the state. \u201cYou got to give me a big win, please, O.K.,\u201d the president pleaded with his supporters. Mr. Trump was hoping to break open a deadlocked race between Mr. Rispone and Mr. Edwards, a moderate Democrat who has carefully avoided criticizing the president in a state where he remains fairly popular. With House Democrats accelerating their investigation into Mr. Trump\u2019s conduct with Ukraine, the White House is eager to show that his core supporters remain loyal and that he can deliver a victory in a state he carried by 20 points. Calling Democrats \u201ccrazed lunatics,\u201d he repeatedly insisted he did nothing wrong in his efforts to urge Ukranians to investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. And, by way of professing his innocence, he noted that he had dethroned the Bush, Clinton and Obama \u201cdynasties\u201d in 2016 and would hardly require foreign interference to win a re-election. \u201cWe need help to beat Sleepy Joe Biden? I don\u2019t think so,\u201d Mr. Trump said. Mr. Trump also claimed with no evidence that congressional Republicans find the impeachment proceedings politically beneficial and have urged him to \u201ckeep this sucker going for a while.\u201d But the president made clear he was not much enjoying his status as the fourth American president to face impeachment and in a rare moment of reflection, he admitted that the process was \u201cvery hard on my family.\u201d \u201cWhat a life I lead,\u201d he said. \u201cYou think this is fun, don\u2019t you.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s introspection was fleeting, however, and he soon returned to his familiar repertoire of hits, belittling his Democratic antagonists on Capitol Hill and at one point venturing that Representative Adam B. Schiff, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, did not have what it takes to suit up for Louisiana State University\u2019s top-ranked football team. As for Mr. Biden, the president said he would gladly face off with him in the general election but warned the crowd that they would witness \u201cthe lowest ratings in the history of debates\u201d because the former vice president \u201cis a very sleepy person.\u201d The president delivered the soundbyte-ready lines he came armed with against Mr. Edwards, calling the pro-gun rights and anti-abortion rights Democrat a tool of Washington liberals. \u201cA vote for John Bel Edwards is a vote for radical leftists,\u201d Mr. Trump said. At another point, he offered an even more demagogic line in a part of Louisiana that bears the scars of an ugly racial history. \u201cJohn Bel Edwards supports illegal aliens, not American citizens,\u201d the president said. He eventually broke character \u2014 \u201cthat was a long harangue,\u201d he observed of his own prepared remarks \u2014 and turned to other interests, such as trumpeting the Oxford University credentials of Senator John Neely Kennedy of Louisiana to a decidedly working-class audience. Mr. Trump brought an array of Louisiana Republicans to the stage, including Mr. Rispone, who echoed the president on how this election could \u201csend a message.\u201d What nobody said explicitly was that the president was under more pressure to deliver after the Kentucky race. Mr. Bevin conceded defeat Thursday as a recanvass of the state\u2019s votes made clear that Andy Beshear, the attorney general, won. Mr. Trump\u2019s task here is not much easier. Mr. Edwards is relatively popular and Mr. Rispone, a business executive and donor, is a first-time candidate who is not well known in the state. But with two appearances in the closing weeks of the race, the president has put his political capital on the line for Mr. Rispone. And the Republican nominee here has done his part to increase the stakes for the White House, linking himself to Mr. Trump at every turn. Mr. Rispone began the race with an ad depicting the \u201cTrump\u201d bumper sticker he placed on his pickup truck. He has also echoed the president\u2019s outsider appeals and pet issue, arguing that a state government needs a businessman while assailing Mr. Edwards over immigration. The governor, while refusing to criticize Mr. Trump, has portrayed Mr. Rispone as one who is grasping the president\u2019s coattails and attempting to \u201cnationalize this race.\u201d \u201cHe cannot win this race based on Louisiana issues because he hasn\u2019t demonstrated any knowledge about how state government works,\u201d Mr. Edwards told supporters in nearby Shreveport on Thursday afternoon. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have any vision for the state of Louisiana.\u201d A West Point graduate and former Army Ranger, Mr. Edwards has expanded Medicaid, raised teachers\u2019 pay and also raised some taxes in an effort to balance the state\u2019s budget. This is the president\u2019s third visit to the state in just over a month. He appeared last month in Lake Charles, La., as part of an effort to drive up Republican turnout in Louisiana\u2019s all-party primary. Mr. Rispone narrowly edged out Representative Ralph Abraham, a Republican, to claim a spot in the runoff against Mr. Edwards and not all the wounds have healed from the Rispone-Abraham contest. That is why the president has returned to the same part of the state \u2014 it is Mr. Abraham\u2019s home base \u2014 in an effort to rally Republicans in what is the last election of 2019. Bringing Mr. Abraham to the stage, Mr. Trump acknowledged their bitter primary, calling it \u201cnasty.\u201d But the president offered little balm, instead reminding Mr. Abraham that Mr. Rispone had self-financed his own victory, and noting that Mr. Abraham had \u201ca little less money to spend than Eddie.\u201d",

      "author": "Eileen Sullivan",
      "content": " Follow our live coverage of Fiona Hill and David Holmes testimony in the Trump impeachment hearings. WASHINGTON \u2014 Gordon D. Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union, delivered explosive testimony to the House Intelligence Committee on Wednesday in the latest round of public hearings in the impeachment inquiry. In his opening statement, Mr. Sondland directly implicated members of the Trump administration \u2014 including President Trump himself \u2014 in a pressure campaign on Ukraine to launch investigations into Mr. Trump\u2019s political rivals. Here are some key takeaways from Mr. Sondland\u2019s testimony. Mr. Sondland told the committee that Mr. Trump directed the Ukraine pressure campaign, that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo signed off, and that Vice President Mike Pence was told about an apparent link between Ukraine\u2019s military aid and the investigations the president desired. He confirmed that there was a \u201cclear quid pro quo\u201d for a White House meeting between Mr. Trump and Ukraine\u2019s president. Mr. Sondland explained to the Democrats\u2019 chief counsel that Mr. Trump\u2019s demand on Ukraine seemed to prioritize the announcement of investigations into his rivals more than it did completing an actual investigation. As far as Mr. Trump was concerned, Ukraine\u2019s announcement that it was investigating the Bidens as part of Mr. Zelensky\u2019s anti-corruption agenda could be damaging enough. Mr. Sondland told lawmakers about interactions with senior administration officials who have tried to keep some distance from the pressure campaign. He mentioned Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the president\u2019s acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, dragging them further into the circle of people who knew about Mr. Trump\u2019s and Mr. Giuliani\u2019s Ukraine foreign policy plan. He also mentioned Mr. Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, John R. Bolton, testifying that he was surprised that Mr. Bolton had called him in late August to request Mr. Giuliani\u2019s contact information before a visit to Kyiv. Mr. Sondland told lawmakers that Mr. Giuliani was asking for a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d \u2014 a visit to the White House for Mr. Zelensky in exchange for a \u201cpublic statement\u201d announcing corruption investigations into widely debunked theories that could benefit Mr. Trump politically. Contradicting testimonies from other witnesses, Mr. Sondland denied the idea that there was a back channel with Ukraine that was operating in the shadows of the typical foreign policy portfolio.",

      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 Two White House national security officials testified before the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry on Tuesday that President Trump\u2019s request to Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate Democratic rivals was inappropriate, and one of them said it validated his \u201cworst fear\u201d that American policy toward that country would veer off course. Hours later, two more witnesses \u2014 another former White House national security official and a former top American diplomat\u00a0\u2014 charted a more careful course but said under oath that the president\u2019s requests on a July 25 phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine were not in line with American national security goals. The new accounts came as the House Intelligence Committee opened a packed week of testimony, with nine witnesses scheduled to answer questions in public before the House leaves for Thanksgiving. Democrats used Tuesday\u2019s back-to-back hearings to move the focus of their growing case to the White House and back to the July phone call they see as the centerpiece of an abuse of power by Mr. Trump. They say he used his office to try to obtain a political advantage from a foreign power. Taking their cues from the White House, Republicans moved aggressively to try to undercut the day\u2019s lead witness, Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman, the National Security Council\u2019s Ukraine expert. They tried to raise questions about Colonel Vindman\u2019s loyalty to the United States, and sought to portray the concerns expressed by Colonel Vindman and an aide to Vice President Mike Pence as merely the opinions of unelected, and even unreliable, bureaucrats second-guessing the president of the United States. Colonel Vindman responded by invoking his sense of duty as an American and an officer to explain why he was so alarmed by Mr. Trump\u2019s request that he reported his concerns to White House lawyers. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe what I was hearing,\u201d said Colonel Vindman, an Iraq war combat veteran who testified in his deep-blue Army dress uniform covered with military ribbons. \u201cIt was probably an element of shock \u2014 that maybe, in certain regards, my worst fear of how our Ukraine policy could play out was playing out, and how this was likely to have significant implications for U.S. national security.\u201d Sitting beside him during the morning\u2019s hearing, Jennifer Williams, a diplomat serving on Mr. Pence\u2019s national security staff, reiterated that she found Mr. Trump\u2019s phone call with Mr. Zelensky \u201cunusual and inappropriate.\u201d She said she was struck that Mr. Trump was pressing a foreign leader about a personal domestic political issue, though she did not report any concerns at the time and spoke in more reserved terms. On the call, Mr. Trump veered off talking points prepared by Colonel Vindman and pressed Mr. Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son Hunter Biden and a debunked theory that Democrats conspired with Ukraine to interfere in the 2016 election. Both witnesses testified that as the summer went on, concerns within the American and Ukrainian governments grew over Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to withhold vital military assistance for the country \u2014 a step he took as he pressed for the investigations. National security officials in the United States unanimously supported releasing the aid, they testified, and some raised legal concerns before it was released in September. Ms. Williams recounted a September meeting between Mr. Pence and Mr. Zelensky in which the Ukrainian president explained in dramatic terms how failing to provide the money would only help Russia. \u201cAny signal or sign that U.S. support was wavering would be construed by Russia as potentially an opportunity for them to strengthen their own hand in Ukraine,\u201d Ms. Williams said, relaying what Mr. Zelensky told Mr. Pence. For Colonel Vindman in particular, the testimony amounted to an unusual act of public criticism of the president by a White House employee \u2014 and it came at an immediate cost. The colonel, who came to the United States as a refugee at 3, referred to his family\u2019s history in Ukraine, a former Soviet republic, noting that in Russia, \u201coffering public testimony involving the president would surely cost me my life.\u201d Addressing his father, who he credited with \u201cthe right decision\u201d in leaving the Soviet Union to seek refuge in the United States 40 years ago, Colonel Vindman said, \u201cDo not worry, I will be fine for telling the truth.\u201d But as Colonel Vindman sat in the stately House Ways and Means Committee Room, the official, taxpayer-funded Twitter account of the White House posted a critical quote in which Tim Morrison, his former boss at the National Security Council, questioned Colonel Vindman\u2019s \u201cjudgment.\u201d Mr. Morrison, the council\u2019s former senior director for Russia and Europe, testified in a second session that went well into Tuesday evening alongside Kurt D. Volker, the former United States special envoy to Ukraine. Public testimony from both men had been requested by Republicans, but they also confirmed key details of the case Democrats are building against Mr. Trump. In carefully calibrated testimony, Mr. Morrison confirmed that he and other White House officials had continuing concerns about Colonel Vindman\u2019s judgment, though he declined to discuss them at length. Mr. Morrison, who listened in on the July 25 call himself from the White House Situation Room, said he wished Colonel Vindman had come to him directly with his concerns. \u201cI think we both agreed we wanted that more full-throated support of President Zelensky and his reform agenda, and we didn\u2019t get it,\u201d Mr. Morrison said of the call. He reported it to White House lawyers himself, but only out of concerns it would be politically damaging if leaked. He said in questioning that he did not view the call as illegal or improper, but added of the requests for investigations that \u201cit\u2019s not what we recommend that the president discuss.\u201d Mr. Volker was more withering. \u201cI don\u2019t think that raising 2016 elections or Vice President Biden or these things I consider to be conspiracy theories that have been circulated by the Ukrainians\u201d were \u201cthings that we should be pursuing as part of our national security strategy with Ukraine,\u201d he testified. \u201cWe should be supporting Ukraine\u2019s democracy, reforms, its own fight against corruption domestically and the struggle against Russia and defense capabilities.\u201d Mr. Volker called Mr. Biden \u201can honorable man.\u201d Mr. Volker played a key role in negotiations during the summer between the Ukrainian government and the Trump administration over whether Mr. Zelensky would be granted an Oval Office meeting with the president. Among the conditions put on Mr. Zelensky was that he make a public commitment to investigating the debunked theory that someone in Ukraine, rather than Russia, was responsible for a hacking of the Democratic National Committee in 2016 and Hunter Biden\u2019s role as a board member of a Ukrainian energy company, Burisma. Much of his testimony revolved around Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, who appears to have instigated a push for investigations, and Gordon D. Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union, who put it into action. Mr. Sondland will testify publicly on Wednesday. Mr. Volker testified that while he was aware Mr. Trump wanted an investigation of Burisma, he did not make the connection at the time between Burisma and the Bidens. He said that he misunderstood that other officials meant the Bidens when they mentioned investigations of Burisma. \u201cIn retrospect, I should have seen that connection differently, and had I done so, I would have raised my own objection,\u201d he said. Mr. Volker also said he was also unaware that other officials saw a connection between the withholding of nearly $400 million in United States military aid to Ukraine and Mr. Zelensky\u2019s willingness to commit to the investigations sought by Mr. Trump. \u201cI did not know of any linkage between the hold on security assistance and Ukraine pursuing investigations,\u201d he testified. \u201cNo one had ever said that to me \u2014 and I never conveyed such a linkage to the Ukrainians.\u201d Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, a top Republican ally of the president\u2019s, cited Mr. Morrison\u2019s comment about Colonel Vindman and criticism from Fiona Hill, his former boss at the National Security Council, to ask why the witness\u2019s concerns ought to be considered relevant. \u201cAny idea why they have those impressions?\u201d Mr. Jordan asked. Colonel Vindman, who apparently came prepared for the criticism, pulled out a copy the performance evaluation Ms. Hill wrote about him in July, read aloud from it and pressed ahead with his account of what transpired. Soft-spoken at first, Colonel Vindman grew more confident in addressing lawmakers who criticized him as the hearing went on. \u201cRanking member, it\u2019s Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, please,\u201d he instructed the committee\u2019s top Republican, Representative Devin Nunes of California, after Mr. Nunes addressed him as \u201cMr. Vindman.\u201d In another exchange that touched on Colonel Vindman\u2019s loyalty to the United States, Steve Castor, the top Republican staff lawyer, asked him about three instances when Oleksandr Danylyuk, the director of Ukraine\u2019s national security council, had approached him with offers to become the country\u2019s defense minister. Colonel Vindman confirmed the offers and testified that he repeatedly declined, dismissing the idea out of hand and reporting the approaches to his superiors and to counterintelligence officials. \u201cEvery single time, I dismissed it,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cI\u2019m an American. I came here when I was a toddler.\u201d Mr. Danylyuk himself said Tuesday that the offer was not a serious one. Democrats fumed, accusing Republicans of sliming a patriot because he had a politically inconvenient story to tell. \u201cThey\u2019ve accused you of espionage and dual loyalties,\u201d said Representative Jim Himes, Democrat of Connecticut. \u201cThe three minutes we asked about the offer making you minister of defense \u2014 that may have been cloaked in a Brooks Brothers suit, but that was designed exclusively to give the right-wing media an opening to questioning your loyalties.\u201d Democrats also continued to push back against what they saw as efforts by Republicans to tease out the name of or information about the whistle-blower whose account of the July 25 call helped lead to the impeachment inquiry. Democrats sought throughout both hearings to redirect attention back to actions by Mr. Trump, who they said withheld the $391 million in assistance earmarked for Ukraine and a coveted White House meeting to get the political advantages he thought Ukraine could deliver him. It may be too early to fully know the effect the hearings are having on public opinion. Television ratings and opinion polls released in recent days suggest that public engagement has so far fallen short not only of hearings at the height of Watergate and the impeachment of President Bill Clinton, but of earlier blockbuster Trump-era congressional hearings. But it is harder to measure the reach of proceedings online and on social media. And after three long days of public testimony, House Republicans appeared to be holding together in Mr. Trump\u2019s corner, either unconvinced his behavior was as the witnesses described or unconvinced that it warranted a remedy as drastic as impeachment. \u201cAn impeachment inquiry is supposed to be clear,\u201d said Representative John Ratcliffe, Republican of Texas. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be obvious, it\u2019s supposed to be overwhelming and compelling, and if two people on the call disagree honestly about whether or not there was a demand and whether or not anything should be reported on a call, that is not a clear and compelling basis to undo 63 million votes and remove a president from office.\u201d",

      "author": "Nicholas Fandos",
      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 John R. Bolton, President Trump\u2019s national security adviser, met privately with the president in August as part of a bid to persuade Mr. Trump to release $391 million in security assistance to Ukraine, a senior National Security Council aide told House impeachment investigators last month. The meeting, which has not been previously reported, came as Mr. Bolton sought to marshal Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet secretaries and top national security advisers to convince the president that it was in the United States\u2019 best interest to unfreeze the funds to help Ukraine defend itself against Russia. But Mr. Bolton emerged with Mr. Trump unmoved, and instructed the aide to look for new opportunities to get those officials in front of Mr. Trump. \u201cThe extent of my recollection is that Ambassador Bolton simply said he wasn\u2019t ready to do it,\u201d said the aide, Timothy Morrison, referring to Mr. Trump, according to a transcript of his testimony released by House Democrats on Saturday. Mr. Bolton, who left the White House in September, has emerged over weeks of interviews as perhaps the single most important witness who has evaded House Democrats as they build a case that Mr. Trump abused the powers of the presidency by withholding vital military assistance and a coveted White House meeting from Ukraine until it delivered investigations he wanted. The new disclosure only makes clearer the significance of his potential testimony. It also underlines the dilemma that House Democrats face over their decision to press ahead with proceedings without his testimony. Last week, Mr. Bolton\u2019s lawyer told House investigators that his client could discuss \u201cmany relevant meetings and conversations\u201d of interest to their inquiry, but he has so far refused to appear without a subpoena and a court order. Democrats have said that Mr. Bolton should show up as is, and that they would not waste their time in court. The outpouring of public testimony and growing political pressure could push Mr. Bolton to change his mind. But for now, there are no signs that either he, or House Democrats, will budge. The release of the transcript was part of a flurry of activity by House Democrats on Saturday, including a rare weekend of closed-door deposition where investigators questioned for the first time a senior budget official about the aid freeze. Mr. Trump unexpectedly withheld the aid in July, despite overwhelming support in Congress and his own administration for its allocation. He only released the money in September, after Mr. Bolton departed and in the face of intense political pressure from Republicans. In addition to Mr. Morrison\u2019s transcript, House Democrats released the transcript of a November interview with Jennifer Williams, a longtime State Department employee with expertise in Europe and Russia who is detailed to Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s national security staff. Earlier in the day, lawmakers and their staffs privately questioned Mark Sandy, a senior budget official, who told investigators that political appointees above him did not provide a rationale for the hold and that he had never encountered a similar situation in his time at the agency, according to two people familiar with his testimony. Mr. Sandy also said that he had sought guidance on the legality of the move, echoing testimony from a Defense Department official who said that she had raised legal concerns. Many of the most significant elements of testimony by Mr. Morrison and Ms. Williams have already been publicly reported, including Mr. Morrison\u2019s account of how a top diplomat close to Mr. Trump informed a top Ukrainian official that the country would probably need to publicly announce investigations Mr. Trump sought before the security money would be released. Still, the transcripts filled in many new details, some of them colorful, about the events under scrutiny by the House and clarified the set of facts both parties were working with as they prepared for another week packed with public hearings. In her hourslong interview, Ms. Williams helped explain why Mr. Pence, who had been scheduled to attend President Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s inaugural in late May, abruptly canceled his trip: She said an assistant to the vice president\u2019s chief of staff, Marc Short, told her that Mr. Trump had asked Mr. Pence to stay home. That fact was included in an anonymous whistle-blower complaint about the Ukraine matter that helped prompt the impeachment inquiry. Mr. Morrison\u2019s testimony added to a portrait of Mr. Bolton working feverishly to ensure the regular interagency policymaking of the executive branch prevailed over an irregular policy channel that appeared meant to serve Mr. Trump\u2019s personal political interests. That channel included the United States\u2019 ambassador to the European Union, the president\u2019s private lawyer and a handful of others pressing Ukraine to commit to investigations of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and a debunked conspiracy theory about Ukraine and the 2016 election. In his testimony, Mr. Morrison said that Mr. Bolton advised him to be wary of the president\u2019s irregular policymaking channel, including the envoy to the European Union, Gordon D. Sondland. \u201cMy consistent direction from Ambassador Bolton was, \u2018Do not get involved, and make sure the lawyers are tracking,\u2019\u201d Mr. Morrison said, referring to Mr. Sondland and the efforts he was involved in. Mr. Morrison\u2019s predecessor as the National Security Council\u2019s senior director for Russia and Europe told investigators that Mr. Bolton issued a similar instruction after a run-in with Mr. Sondland, who will testify publicly himself next week. Mr. Morrison\u2019s testimony made clear that he and Mr. Bolton were deeply skeptical of Mr. Sondland, a wealthy hotelier and political donor turned ambassador. He said he suspected Mr. Sondland\u2019s stated influence with the president might be exaggerated. Following Mr. Bolton\u2019s directions, he reported interactions he had with the ambassador to White House lawyers. But when he followed up, Mr. Sondland seemed to be telling the truth and appeared to have Mr. Trump\u2019s ear on Ukraine matters. \u201cAmbassador Sondland believed and at least related to me that the president was giving him instruction,\u201d Mr. Morrison testified. Mr. Morrison described witnessing Mr. Sondland approach an aide to Mr. Zelensky during a high-level meeting in Warsaw in September. The conversation took place just after a meeting in which Mr. Pence assured Mr. Zelensky that the United States still fully supported Ukraine and would decide on the security aid soon. The vice president did not mention the investigations during the meeting, Ms. Williams said. Mr. Sondland was blunter, though, he later told Mr. Morrison. He told Mr. Zelensky\u2019s adviser that \u201cwhat could help them move the aid was if the prosecutor general would go to the mic and announce that he was opening\u201d the investigation Mr. Trump wanted. Mr. Morrison\u2019s account already prompted Mr. Sondland to revise his own private testimony, but it also underscored the importance both to Mr. Trump and to Democrats of his public appearance next week, as one of the few cooperating witnesses who directly spoke to Mr. Trump about his interest in Ukraine. Both Ms. Williams and Mr. Morrison listened in on a July 25 phone call between Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky. She told investigators she was taken aback by the mention of investigations of the Bidens and Burisma, a Ukrainian energy firm that Mr. Biden\u2019s son worked for. She found the discussion to be \u201cmore political in nature,\u201d and therefore \u201cunusual and inappropriate.\u201d Mr. Morrison had a different reaction. He testified he found nothing inherently problematic about the call, but he still went to White House lawyers to express concerns that a record of the call could leak and would be unflattering for the president. He recommended that access to it be limited, and eventually a reconstructed transcript was placed on the White House\u2019s most secure server. Mr. Morrison testified that John A. Eisenberg, the council\u2019s top lawyer, told him that had been a mistake and that he had only intended for access to the document to be restricted. He \u201crelated that he did not ask for it to be put on there, but that the Executive Secretariat staff misunderstood his recommendation for how to restrict access,\u201d Mr. Morrison said. Republicans believe the testimony undercuts Democrats\u2019 allegation that the White House was trying to cover up the call. But it does not explain why the call summary was not removed from the highly secure server when Mr. Eisenberg learned it was there. The president\u2019s allies are also likely to use Mr. Morrison\u2019s closed-door interview to try to undercut Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman, the White House\u2019s top Ukraine expert, when he testifies publicly next week about his deep alarm over the July 25 call and other matters. Mr. Morrison told investigators that, \u201cI had concerns that he did not exercise appropriate judgment as to whom he would say what.\u201d Mr. Sandy was the first budget official to speak with impeachment investigators. At least three higher-profile Trump administration officials connected to the budget office have stiff-armed the inquiry: Russell T. Vought, the agency\u2019s acting director; Michael Duffey, who helped carry out Mr. Trump\u2019s directive to freeze the aid; and Mick Mulvaney, who retains the title of budget director and is the acting White House chief of staff. He testified that he was directed to sign paperwork on July 25 enforcing the hold, but that Mr. Duffey, a political appointee, signed such paperwork going forward, a highly unusual intervention by his account. Why precisely Mr. Trump withheld the funding as he pressed Ukraine for the politically beneficial investigations and what Mr. Mulvaney told the agency about the decision remain central unanswered questions in the inquiry. \u201cThis is a technical part of our investigation. We want to know exactly how the president translated his political objective to shake down the Ukrainian government for the favors he wanted translated into the budget process,\u201d said Representative Jamie Raskin, Democrat of Maryland.",

Of Bias Claims|November 23, 2019, Page A1",
      "author": "Adam Goldman",
      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 A highly anticipated report by the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general is expected to sharply criticize lower-level F.B.I. officials as well as bureau leaders involved in the early stages of the Trump-Russia investigation, but to absolve the top ranks of abusing their powers out of bias against President Trump, according to people briefed on a draft. Investigators for the inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, uncovered errors and omissions in documents related to the wiretapping of a former Trump campaign adviser, Carter Page \u2014 including that a low-level lawyer, Kevin Clinesmith, altered an email that officials used to prepare to seek court approval to renew the wiretap, the people said. Mr. Horowitz referred his findings about Mr. Clinesmith to prosecutors for a potential criminal charge. Mr. Clinesmith left the Russia investigation in February 2018 after the inspector general identified him as one of a handful of F.B.I. officials who expressed animus toward Mr. Trump in text messages and resigned about two months ago, after the inspector general\u2019s team interviewed him. Though Mr. Trump\u2019s allies have seized on the messages from Mr. Clinesmith and his colleagues as proof of anti-Trump bias, Mr. Clinesmith has not been a prominent figure in the partisan firefight over the investigation. His lawyer declined to comment, as did a spokeswoman for Mr. Horowitz. More broadly, Mr. Horowitz\u2019s report, to be made public on Dec. 9, portrays the overall effort to seek the wiretap order and its renewals as sloppy and unprofessional, according to the people familiar with it. He will also sharply criticize as careless one of the F.B.I. case agents in New York handling the matter and say that the bureau and the Justice Department displayed poor coordination during the investigation, they said. At the same time, however, the report debunks a series of conspiracy theories and insinuations about the F.B.I. that Mr. Trump and his allies have put forward over the past two years, the people said, though they cautioned that the report is not complete. The New York Times has not reviewed the draft, which could contain other significant findings. In particular, while Mr. Horowitz criticizes F.B.I. leadership for its handling of the highly fraught Russia investigation in some ways, he made no finding of politically biased actions by top officials Mr. Trump has vilified like the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey; Andrew G. McCabe, the former deputy who temporarily ran the bureau after the president fired Mr. Comey in 2017; and Peter Strzok, a former top counterintelligence agent. The early accounts of the report suggest that it is likely to stoke the debate over the investigation without definitively resolving it, by offering both sides different conclusions they can point to as vindication for their rival worldviews. The wiretap of Mr. Page emerged as a political flash point in early 2018, though it was one relatively narrow aspect of the sprawling inquiry that found that Moscow sought to help Mr. Trump win the election and that his campaign expected to benefit, but found insufficient evidence to charge any conspiracy with the Trump campaign. Rod J. Rosenstein, the former deputy attorney general who oversaw legal matters related to the 2016 election, asked Mr. Horowitz to scrutinize the wiretap and broader issues related to the investigation, absorbing pressure from Mr. Trump and his allies. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court first approved wiretapping Mr. Page, who had close ties to Russia, as a suspected unregistered agent of a foreign power in October 2016, after he had left the campaign. The Justice Department obtained three renewal orders. The paperwork associated with the renewal applications contained information that should have been left out, and vice versa, the people briefed on the draft report said. The email Mr. Clinesmith handled was a factor during the wiretap renewal process, according to the people. Mr. Clinesmith took an email from an official at another federal agency that contained several factual assertions, then added material to the bottom that looked like another assertion from the email\u2019s author, when it was instead his own understanding. Mr. Clinesmith included this altered email in a package that he compiled for another F.B.I. official to read in preparation for signing an affidavit that would be submitted to the court attesting to the facts and analysis in the wiretap application. The details of the email are apparently classified and may not be made public even when the report is unveiled. The investigators\u2019 referral of its findings on Mr. Clinesmith went to John H. Durham, a prosecutor assigned by Attorney General William P. Barr to also re-examine the Russia case and its origins. The referral from Mr. Horowitz\u2019s team appears to be at least in part the basis for the elevation of Mr. Durham\u2019s inquiry from an administrative review to a criminal investigation, the people said. Additionally, Mr. Clinesmith worked on both the Hillary Clinton email investigation and the Russia investigation. He was among the F.B.I. officials removed by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, after Mr. Horowitz found text messages expressing political animus against Mr. Trump. Shortly after Mr. Trump\u2019s election victory, for example, Mr. Clinesmith texted another official that \u201cthe crazies won finally,\u201d disparaged Mr. Trump\u2019s health care and immigration agendas, and called Vice President Mike Pence \u201cstupid.\u201d In another text, he wrote, in the context of a question about whether he intended to stay in government, \u201cviva la resistance.\u201d In a June 2018 report by Mr. Horowitz about that and other politically charged texts, which identified him as \u201cF.B.I. Attorney 2,\u201d Mr. Clinesmith said he was expressing his personal views but did not let them affect his official actions. The inspector general apparently did not assert in the draft report that any of the problems he found were so material that the court would have rejected the Justice Department\u2019s requests to continue surveilling Mr. Page. But the people familiar with the draft were uncertain about whether Mr. Horowitz said the problems were immaterial, or instead avoided taking a position on that question. CNN first reported that the draft accused a lower-level lawyer of altering a document. Mr. Clinesmith\u2019s identification and details about the findings have not previously been reported. In a phone call on Friday to \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d Mr. Trump played up the initial revelations to claim that \u201cthey were spying on my campaign and it went right to the top and everybody knows it and now we\u2019re going to find out\u201d and \u201cthey tried to overthrow the presidency.\u201d The accounts of Mr. Horowitz\u2019s findings do not support that assertion. And in other crucial respects, the draft inspector general report is said not to corroborate conspiracy theories and insinuations offered by Mr. Trump and his allies about the early stages of the Russia investigation, before Mr. Mueller was appointed as special counsel and took it over. For example, the draft report also concludes that the F.B.I. had enough evidence to meet the legal standard for opening the investigation, though Mr. Horowitz emphasized that the bar is low, the people said. The report is also said to conclude that Joseph Mifsud, a Russia-linked professor who told a Trump campaign official that Russia had damaging information on Mrs. Clinton in the form of hacked Democratic emails \u2014 a key fact used to open the investigation \u2014 was not an F.B.I. informant. That undercuts an assertion of conservative critics of the inquiry. None of the evidence used to open the investigation came from the C.I.A. or from a notorious dossier of claims about Trump-Russia ties compiled by Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence agent whose research was funded by Democrats, the report concludes, according to the people briefed on it. Mr. Trump\u2019s allies have complained about how the Justice Department used information from the Steele dossier in the wiretap applications. Along with evidence from other sources, the filings cited some information from Mr. Steele\u2019s dossier about meetings that Mr. Page was rumored to have had with Kremlin representatives during a trip to Russia that year. Republicans have criticized any use of political opposition research in applications for Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act wiretaps, which are among the most intrusive tools investigators have and are highly regulated. But the people briefed on the draft said Mr. Horowitz does not criticize them for the basic fact that they used the information. Still, people familiar with questions asked by Mr. Horowitz\u2019s investigators have suggested that he is likely to conclude that the filings exaggerated Mr. Steele\u2019s track record in terms of the amount of value that the F.B.I. derived from information he supplied in previous investigations. The court filings in the Page wiretap application said his material was \u201cused in criminal proceedings,\u201d but it was never part of an affidavit, search warrant or courtroom evidence. But it remains unclear what other judgments Mr. Horowitz is preparing to render about related disputes related to the use of Mr. Steele\u2019s information in the surveillance materials. The wiretap applications contained a lengthy footnote telling the judges that Mr. Steele\u2019s research was believed to have been commissioned by someone seeking information that would damage the Trump campaign. But it did not specifically identify the funders \u2014 the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign. The original October 2016 application said investigators did not know the identity of Mr. Steele\u2019s patrons. But even in 2017, after they specifically learned that Democrats paid a research firm to unearth material that could hurt Mr. Trump, law enforcement officials did not update the language in the renewal applications. Defenders of the bureau\u2019s inaction argued that the original footnote was sufficient to alert the surveillance court that Mr. Steele gathered the information in a political context and noted that it is standard practice to keep names of individual Americans or organizations out of such documents. It also remains unclear what the inspector general concluded about Mr. Steele\u2019s contacts with Bruce Ohr, a Justice Department official. Mr. Ohr, an expert on Russian organized crime and himself a frequent target of Mr. Trump, spoke with Mr. Steele several times after the F.B.I. terminated its relationship with him. Mr. Ohr briefed the bureau about those conversations. His wife also worked for the opposition research firm that hired Mr. Steele. In his comments to Fox on Friday, Mr. Trump appeared to be looking past Mr. Horowitz\u2019s report and potentially anticipating its complex findings. \u201cPerhaps even more importantly,\u201d he said, \u201cyou have Durham coming out shortly thereafter.\u201d ",

      "author": "Emily S. Rueb",
      "content": " [Catch up on key moments from Fiona Hill\u2019s and David Holmes\u2019s testimony on Thursday.] Democrats and Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee took turns on Thursday questioning David Holmes, a career diplomat who said he was told President Trump cared more about investigating his political rivals than about the welfare of Ukraine. As a political counselor to the United States Embassy in Ukraine\u2019s capital, Mr. Holmes was privy to high-level conversations between top American and Ukrainian officials, and was often expected to take detailed notes of their conversations. One of these conversations in particular \u2014 a cellphone call between Mr. Trump and Gordon D. Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union \u2014 has been a focal point of the House impeachment hearings. During the call, Mr. Sondland assured Mr. Trump that Ukraine\u2019s newly elected president, Volodymyr Zelensky, would be willing to go along with his demand to investigate the business dealings of Hunter Biden, the younger son of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., according to Mr. Holmes. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this,\u201d Mr. Holmes said last Friday in closed-door testimony to House impeachment investigators. \u201cThere\u2019s just so much about the call that was so remarkable that I remember it vividly,\u201d he said. Mr. Holmes\u2019s account shed new light on how Trump administration officials leveraged political power, including a White House meeting and hundreds of millions of dollars in military assistance, to bend Ukrainian officials to Mr. Trump\u2019s will. \u201cI think the Ukrainians gradually came to understand that they were being asked to do something in exchange for the meeting and the security assistance hold being lifted,\u201d Mr. Holmes testified. Mr. Holmes, who holds degrees from Pomona College in California, the University of St. Andrews in Scotland and Princeton University, joined the State Department under President George W. Bush. Since then, he has been stationed in Russia, Afghanistan, India, Colombia and Kosovo. He also served on the National Security Council in Washington. Throughout his service, Mr. Holmes developed a reputation for outspokenness. In 2014, after stints in Kabul and Delhi, Mr. Holmes received an award for \u201cconstructive dissent\u201d for raising concerns about President Barack Obama\u2019s policies toward South Asia. He arrived in Kyiv in August 2017 and worked closely with Marie L. Yovanovitch, who has since been ousted as ambassador to Ukraine. As her chief political adviser, he said he developed a \u201crespect for her dedication, determination and professionalism.\u201d But in March 2019, Mr. Holmes noted a major shift. Instead of a diplomatic policy focused on supporting Ukrainian democratic reform and resistance to Russian aggression, he said in written testimony presented on Friday, it became \u201covershadowed by a political agenda being promoted by Rudy Giuliani and a cadre of officials operating with a direct channel to the White House.\u201d The cellphone call at the center of the impeachment inquiry took place on July 26, when Mr. Holmes was having lunch at a restaurant in Kyiv with Mr. Sondland and two other American officials. His account is seen by Democrats as bolstering their claims of a quid pro quo between Ukraine\u2019s willingness to investigate the Bidens and military aid and support from the United States. Mr. Sondland, a wealthy hotelier and political megadonor appointed by Mr. Trump, called Mr. Trump on his cellphone to tell him that Mr. Zelensky \u201cloves your ass,\u201d and will do \u201canything you ask him to.\u201d Mr. Trump was speaking so loudly that Mr. Sondland held the phone away from his ear, Mr. Holmes testified on Friday. Mr. Trump then asked, \u201cSo, he\u2019s going to do the investigation?\u201d Mr. Sondland replied, \u201cHe\u2019s going to do it.\u201d At the same lunch, Mr. Sondland acknowledged that Mr. Trump cared only about \u201cbig stuff,\u201d like the \u201cBiden investigation\u201d that his lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani was pushing for because it affected him personally, Mr. Holmes testified on Friday. His testimony has added new details about the call, which was first revealed during public testimony by Mr. Holmes\u2019s boss, William B. Taylor Jr., the top American envoy in Ukraine.",

      "author": "Michael D. Shear",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Heading into Friday\u2019s impeachment hearing, the Republican strategy for dealing with Marie L. Yovanovitch was simple: treat the ousted ambassador to Ukraine with respect during her testimony on Friday and avoid any appearance of bullying a veteran diplomat who had been vilified and driven from her post. President Trump blew up the plan. Ms. Yovanovitch had just begun to recount, in powerful and personal terms, the devastation and fear she felt when she learned Mr. Trump had attacked her during a July 25 phone call with the president of Ukraine. She was \u201cshocked, appalled, devastated that the president of the United States would talk about any ambassador like that,\u201d she said. It was just the kind of human moment that Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee had anticipated \u2014 a political trap they were determined not to fall into. But they apparently didn\u2019t anticipate how Mr. Trump would react. \u201cEverywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter, sneering at her to his 66 million followers while recounting an earlier posting in her diplomatic career. \u201cShe started off in Somalia, how did that go?\u201d By repeating the same kind of verbal attack that made Ms. Yovanovitch a sympathetic witness for the Democrats in the first place, Mr. Trump undercut his own party\u2019s best chance at minimizing the impact of her testimony. And he handed Democrats another new argument \u2014 that his tweet amounted to nothing less than witness intimidation that itself could become an article of impeachment. \u201cThat was not part of the plan, obviously,\u201d said Jeff Flake, the former Republican senator from Arizona, who clashed repeatedly with Mr. Trump before he retired in 2017. \u201cHe can\u2019t help himself. You would think every instinct would be to lay off. She\u2019s a sympathetic witness. But he seems just to be incapable of controlling himself.\u201d The president\u2019s tweet was at once surprising and entirely predictable. Mr. Trump has used Twitter to attack his adversaries nearly 6,000 times since becoming president. He has repeatedly tweeted that the impeachment inquiry is a \u201choax\u201d and has lashed out at diplomats and national security officials calling them \u201cnever Trumpers\u201d who are out to undermine his agenda. For weeks, he and his allies have obsessed about the identity of the whistle-blower whose complaint about Mr. Trump\u2019s phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine jump-started the impeachment inquiry. But his decision to fling the sharp-edged insult an hour into Ms. Yovanovitch\u2019s testimony was the latest evidence \u2014 as if any more was needed \u2014 that Mr. Trump\u2019s instincts are rarely in sync with the interests of his party. White House aides insisted on Friday that the president was too busy to watch the hearing, but in fact, he chose to watch Ms. Yovanovitch, who had stuck in his craw because he saw her as an obstacle to his desire to have investigations into Hunter Biden, the younger son of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., people close to Mr. Trump said. On the first day of the impeachment hearings on Wednesday, the president had managed to avoid commenting about the two men who testified \u2014 William B. Taylor Jr., the top diplomat in Ukraine, and George P. Kent, a senior State Department official. But his inability to hold his fire on Friday raised fresh doubts among his allies and White House advisers about what he will do next week, when eight witnesses are scheduled to testify in public hearings over the course of three days. Mr. Trump did not clear his Friday tweet with top White House aides before putting it out, leaving some of his advisers deeply dispirited. Privately, they acknowledged he had done himself damage. Not long after Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet, his son Donald Trump Jr. fired off his own broadside, tweeting, \u201cAmerica hired \u2066\u202a@realDonaldTrump\u202c\u2069 to fire people like the first three witnesses we\u2019ve seen. Career government bureaucrats and nothing more.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s congressional allies had largely held back from those kinds of direct attacks on Mr. Taylor and Mr. Kent. They had planned to be especially careful with Ms. Yovanovitch. On Thursday, they met for several hours in Room HVC-215 of the Capitol for a practice session aimed at coordinating their overall message, with members who were not on the Intelligence Committee playing the parts of the former ambassador and Representative Adam B. Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the Intelligence committee. One thing they were clear about: They intended to use the same care grilling Ms. Yovanovitch that Republican senators tried to employ during last year\u2019s testimony by Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Justice Brett Kavanaugh of assaulting her when the two were in high school, according to one person close to the House Republican leadership. Mr. Trump didn\u2019t get the message \u2014 and Democrats seized on the political opportunity he handed them. Not long after the president tweeted his thoughts on Ms. Yovanovitch, Mr. Schiff read it aloud, to Ms. Yovanovitch and the cameras. \u201cNow the president, in real time, is attacking you,\u201d Mr. Schiff told her. \u201cWhat effect do you think that has on other witnesses willingness to come forward and expose wrongdoing?\u201d Her answer was succinct: \u201cIt\u2019s very intimidating.\u201d Representative Eric Swalwell, Democrat of California, used his five minutes of questioning at the hearing to decry what he called the president\u2019s \u201cdisgusting\u201d tweet. \u201cHe smeared you when you were in Ukraine,\u201d Mr. Swalwell told Ms. Yovanovitch. \u201cHe smeared you on that phone call with President Zelensky on July 25. He is smearing you right now as you are testifying. Ambassador Yovanovitch, are the president\u2019s smears going to stop you from fighting corruption?\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d she answered, clearly not wanting to take the bait of a direct confrontation with the president, \u201cI will continue my work.\u201d Following the hearing, some Republican lawmakers defended the president\u2019s decision to tweet at Ms. Yovanovitch even as others grudgingly acknowledged that it wasn\u2019t the kind of message they had hoped to highlight. \u201cWe\u2019re not here to talk about tweets,\u201d Representative Elise Stefanik, Republican of New York, told reporters. \u201cThis is not the first or last tweet they are going to complain about.\u201d But under repeated questioning, she added: \u201cI said I disagree with the tone of the tweet.\u201d Ms. Stefanik and other Republican members struggled to focus on the message they had hoped to deliver throughout the day: that Democrats had put in place an unfair impeachment process that denied Mr. Trump\u2019s defenders their rights. Representative Lee Zeldin, Republican of New York, said Mr. Trump was just \u201cfighting back.\u201d But that was not how the week was supposed to go, especially at the White House, where Mr. Trump had scheduled a series of events to highlight what he said he was doing while the Democrats were focused on impeachment. The idea was to embrace the strategy that former president Bill Clinton used during his own impeachment fight. Mr. Clinton described that strategy on CNN on Thursday. \u201cI would say, \u2018I\u2019ve got lawyers and staff people handling this impeachment inquiry and they should just have at it,\u2019\u201d Mr. Clinton said. \u201c\u2018Meanwhile, I\u2019m going to work for the American people.\u2019 That\u2019s what I would do.\u201d Early Friday morning, Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary, issued a statement saying that Mr. Trump would watch the opening statement by the top Republican on the committee. She added, \u201cbut the rest of the day, he will be working hard for the American people.\u201d To illustrate that, the White House had scheduled an announcement for Friday afternoon on new rules to promote \u201chonesty and transparency\u201d in health care prices. But as soon as the event was over, reporters deluged the president with questions \u2014 about his Yovanovitch tweet.",

      "author": "Charlie Savage",
      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump on Friday attacked Marie L. Yovanovitch, the former United States ambassador to Ukraine he summarily removed this year, even as she testified in the impeachment inquiry about how she felt threatened by Mr. Trump. Did his behavior amount to witness tampering? If the question is what could be charged in court, the answer is probably not. But impeachment is not limited to ordinary crimes. As House Democrats weigh bringing articles of impeachment against Mr. Trump \u2014 including one potentially based on his obstruction of congressional investigations \u2014 the president\u2019s Twitter onslaught may well have handed them more fodder. As Ms. Yovanovitch was telling the House Intelligence Committee about the devastation and fear she felt this year when she was targeted first by Mr. Trump\u2019s allies and later by the president himself during a phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, Mr. Trump fired off a tweet denigrating her anew. \u201cEverywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad. She started off in Somalia, how did that go?\u201d Mr. Trump wrote, assailing her on Twitter to his 66 million followers. Early in her career, Ms. Yovanovitch was a low-level diplomatic officer stationed in Somalia as that country was starting to slide toward the civil war that would leave it a failed state. A few minutes after the president\u2019s tweet, Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, interrupted Ms. Yovanovitch\u2019s testimony to read it and ask her what the effect the president\u2019s attack on her would have \u201con other witnesses\u2019 willingness to come forward and expose wrongdoing.\u201d She appeared momentarily uncertain how to respond. \u201cIt\u2019s very intimidating,\u201d she said. She then paused, searching for words. \u201cI can\u2019t speak to what the president is trying to do, but the effect is to be intimidating.\u201d Mr. Schiff responded in a stern tone: \u201cSome of us here take witness intimidation very, very seriously.\u201d In a statement, Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary, denied that Mr. Trump\u2019s denigration of Ms. Yovanovitch rose to that level. \u201cThe tweet was not witness intimidation,\u201d Ms. Grisham said. \u201cIt was simply the president\u2019s opinion, which he is entitled to. This is not a trial, it is a partisan political process \u2014 or to put it more accurately, a totally illegitimate, charade stacked against the president.\u201d Mr. Trump has a history of using his platform to excoriate people who are in a position to serve as witnesses to his own potential wrongdoing, using Twitter and statements at his political rallies to criticize less well-known people by name, in humiliating and sometimes threatening ways. The targets of his verbal assaults have included Michael D. Cohen, his former personal lawyer and fixer, who testified that Mr. Trump violated campaign-finance laws and fraudulently manipulated the value of his assets in financial forms; Donald F. McGahn II, his former White House lawyer, a key witness to several obstruction episodes in the special counsel\u2019s report; and James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, who testified that Mr. Trump privately pushed him to shut down a criminal investigation into his former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn. The tactic functions not just as an attempt to discredit his critics, but as a warning to deter others from coming forward. At a minimum, it can unleash a cascade of abuse online and harassing messages from Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters, which can be especially unsettling for people who are not accustomed to being in the public eye. But it can also raise fears that some unhinged person may go further: This year, a fervent Trump supporter, Cesar A. Sayoc Jr., was sentenced to 20 years in prison for mailing bombs to people and organizations that Mr. Trump had criticized, including prominent Democrats and journalists. Federal witness tampering law, which is part of a broader obstruction of justice statute, makes it a felony, under some circumstances, to try to dissuade or hinder witnesses from attending or testifying in an official proceeding. The president\u2019s tweet on Friday did not threaten Ms. Yovanovitch. But the law covers not just threats and intimidation, which are punishable by 20 years in prison, but mere harassment as well, a lesser but still serious offense punishable by three years in prison. Still, even viewed as mere harassment, Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks on Ms. Yovanovitch on Friday would be challenging to prosecute under the witness tampering statute. Prosecutors would be hard pressed to convince a jury that he was trying to dissuade her, at least, from attending the hearing and testifying because he waited to lash out until after she was already in the hearing room and in the midst of testifying. A hypothetical prosecution under that law would face severe constitutional challenges, as well. The Justice Department has taken the view that the Constitution makes sitting presidents temporarily immune from prosecution, and Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers could argue that he had a First Amendment right to criticize her. In fact, the president himself raised the issue at the White House on Friday afternoon when asked if he was guilty of witness intimidation, denying the charge and saying, \u201cI want freedom of speech.\u201d To the extent that Mr. Trump\u2019s targeting of Ms. Yovanovitch was less about shutting her up and more about making other government officials watching what she is going through think twice about defying the White House\u2019s direction not to cooperate with Congress, the witness tampering statute was not clearly written to cover that situation. But when deciding what amounts to an impeachable offense, Congress is not limited to violations of ordinary criminal statutes. Lawmakers may also impeach a president for actions that are lawful, yet still constitute abuses of power. House Democrats are already considering articles of impeachment focused on obstruction of Congress, including for Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to push witnesses to defy subpoenas, and obstruction of justice, including for attempting to tamper with witnesses in the Russia investigation led by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. For example, Mr. Mueller\u2019s report recounted how Mr. Trump bullied Mr. McGahn in an attempt to get him to write a memo falsely denying that Mr. Trump had earlier sought to have Mr. Mueller fired. Mr. McGahn had already given a deposition about that earlier episode, so writing such a memo \u2014 which he refused to do \u2014 would have contradicted his account and discredited him as a witness. The Mueller report also recounted how Mr. Trump and his proxies had dangled the prospect of pardons in front of several potential witnesses in the special counsel investigation, while urging them not to \u201cflip\u201d on him and cooperate with prosecutors. Against that backdrop, Representative Jim Himes, Democrat of Connecticut and a member of the Intelligence Committee, said that Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks on Ms. Yovanovitch amounted to \u201cclear witness tampering\u201d that could be cited in a forthcoming article of impeachment. \u201cThe president chose to respond to a patriotic and superb public servant with lies and intimidation. Vintage Donald Trump,\u201d Mr. Himes said in a text. \u201cHer boss disparaged and intimidated her not after, but during her testimony.\u201d",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 An official from the United States Embassy in Kiev confirmed to House impeachment investigators on Friday that he had overheard a call between President Trump and a top American diplomat in July in which the president asked whether Ukraine was going to move forward with an investigation he wanted. The official, David Holmes, testified privately that he was at a restaurant in Kiev, Ukraine\u2019s capital, when he overheard Mr. Trump on a cellphone call loudly asking Gordon D. Sondland, the American ambassador to the European Union, if Ukraine\u2019s president had agreed to conduct an investigation into one of his leading political rivals. Mr. Sondland, who had just come from a meeting with top Ukrainian officials and the country\u2019s president, replied in the affirmative. \u201cSo, he\u2019s going to do the investigation?\u201d Mr. Trump asked, according to a copy of Mr. Holmes\u2019s opening statement posted by CNN and confirmed by The New York Times. Mr. Sondland, a wealthy hotelier and political donor turned ambassador, told Mr. Trump that President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine \u201cloves your ass,\u201d and would conduct the investigation and do \u201canything you ask him to,\u201d according to Mr. Holmes\u2019s statement. After the call ended, Mr. Holmes asked if it was true that the president did not care about Ukraine. Mr. Sondland, he testified, agreed. According to Mr. Holmes\u2019s account, the ambassador said Mr. Trump cared only about the \u201cbig stuff.\u201d Mr. Holmes noted Ukraine had \u201cbig stuff\u201d going on, like a war with Russia. But Mr. Sondland had something else in mind. He told Mr. Holmes he meant \u201c\u2018big stuff\u2019 that benefits the president,\u201d like the \u201cBiden investigation\u201d that his lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani was pushing for, because it affected him personally. The account could prove significant as Democrats continue to build an impeachment case against Mr. Trump. It illustrates how preoccupied he was with persuading Ukraine\u2019s president to go along with his demand that the country commit publicly to investigating former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., a leading political rival, and how he actively used his power and the instruments of American foreign policy to see that it happened. It adds significant new detail to a conversation that was first revealed on Wednesday during public testimony by Mr. Holmes\u2019s boss, William B. Taylor Jr., the top American envoy in Ukraine. Mr. Taylor said then that he had only recently learned of the episode from Mr. Holmes. And it raised the possibility that Mr. Holmes could be called to testify publicly in the impeachment inquiry and presented Democrats with new leads to track down even as they conduct a string of high-profile public hearings with other witnesses. Mr. Holmes, a career Foreign Service officer who is the political counselor in the American Embassy in Kiev, said he had been following the impeachment inquiry from afar in recent weeks and came to understand only belatedly that he had pertinent information to share. He testified under subpoena by the House Intelligence Committee after the State Department directed him not to appear, according to an official working on the inquiry. \u201cI came to realize I had firsthand knowledge regarding certain events on July 26 that had not otherwise been reported, and that those events potentially bore on the question of whether the president did, in fact, have knowledge that those officials were using the levers of our diplomatic power to induce the new Ukrainian president to announce the opening of a particular criminal investigation,\u201d he testified. Mr. Holmes\u2019s account of the relationship between the two countries in his opening statement was broader, though, and closely resembles that offered by other top officials who have offered public and private testimony to the House. He described how Mr. Sondland and two other American officials \u2014 Energy Secretary Rick Perry and Kurt D. Volker, the United States special envoy to Ukraine \u2014 styled themselves as the \u201cThree Amigos\u201d and took charge of Ukraine policy within the administration. On the outside, Mr. Giuliani exercised significant influence over what they did. \u201cBeginning in March 2019, the situation in the embassy and in Ukraine changed dramatically,\u201d Mr. Holmes said, according to his statement. \u201cSpecifically, our diplomatic policy that had been focused on supporting Ukrainian democratic reform and resistance to Russian aggression became overshadowed by a political agenda being promoted by Rudy Giuliani and a cadre of officials operating with a direct channel to the White House.\u201d The conversation between Mr. Trump and Mr. Sondland took place on July 26, one day after Mr. Trump personally pressed Mr. Zelensky in a now-famous phone call to investigate Mr. Biden and his son Hunter Biden, as well as unproven allegations that Ukraine conspired with Democrats to interfere in the 2016 election. Mr. Trump specifically wanted an investigation into unsubstantiated corruption allegations related to Hunter Biden\u2019s work for a Ukrainian energy firm, Burisma Holdings. Mr. Sondland did not mention the episode to investigators last month when he answered their questions in private. He will almost certainly be asked about it next week when he appears for public testimony before the House Intelligence Committee. He has already revised his initial testimony once, admitting to the panel last week that he told a top Ukrainian official that the country would probably not receive a package of nearly $400 million in security assistance Mr. Trump froze in July unless it committed publicly to the investigations Mr. Trump sought. And Republicans have argued that he may be overstating his access to and influence with the president. On Thursday, two people familiar with the matter said that a second embassy official, Suriya Jayanti, also overheard the call and could corroborate Mr. Holmes\u2019s account. It is unclear if investigators will also call her to testify. On Friday, Mr. Holmes indicated there was a third person present who would have overheard it, as well. Mr. Holmes told investigators that he did not take notes during the conversation, but said he immediately told other embassy officials about it. The conversation took place not long after Mr. Sondland had met directly with Mr. Zelensky and other officials. Mr. Holmes\u2019s account gave hints that Mr. Trump\u2019s request may have been on Mr. Zelensky\u2019s mind, but it does not indicate what, if anything, he or his aides may have communicated to Mr. Sondland. In the meeting, Mr. Holmes recalled, Mr. Zelensky said that Mr. Trump had raised \u201csome very sensitive issues\u201d \u201cthree times\u201d on the call \u2014 issues the Ukrainian leader noted they would have to follow up on in person. Mr. Holmes described sitting on the terrace of a Kiev restaurant a little while later during lunch with Mr. Sondland, sharing a bottle of wine, when Mr. Sondland called Mr. Trump. The president was speaking so loudly, he said, that Mr. Sondland held the phone away from his ear and Mr. Holmes and others could hear Mr. Trump\u2019s voice. In addition to discussing the investigations, Mr. Trump and Mr. Sondland discussed ASAP Rocky, an American rapper imprisoned in Sweden at the time on charges of assault. Mr. Sondland told the president the rapper \u201cshould have pled guilty,\u201d according to Mr. Holmes\u2019s written statement. Mr. Sondland then advised Mr. Trump that he should \u201clet him get sentenced, play the racism card, give him a ticker-tape when he comes home,\u201d Mr. Holmes testified. The ambassador added that Sweden \u201cshould have released him on your word,\u201d and added, referring to an American reality show celebrity family pressing for Mr. Trump\u2019s help in the case, \u201cyou can tell the Kardashians you tried.\u201d Mr. Sondland noted after the call that the president was in a \u201cbad mood.\u201d Mr. Holmes\u2019s account included other potentially significant details new to investigators about Trump administration officials using a White House meeting and the frozen military assistance as leverage for what Mr. Trump wanted. He testified that Mr. Taylor told him at the time about a June 28 call with him, the \u201cThree Amigos\u201d and Mr. Zelensky in which \u201cit was made clear that some action on a Burisma/Biden investigation was a precondition for an Oval Office meeting.\u201d Mr. Taylor described the same call in his testimony, saying that Mr. Sondland had said he \u201cwanted to make sure no one was transcribing or monitoring\u201d the call. But Mr. Taylor did not say that investigations or preconditions had been discussed. \u201cIt is important to understand that a White House visit was critical to President Zelensky,\u201d Mr. Holmes said. \u201cHe needed to demonstrate U.S. support at the highest levels both to advance his ambitious anti-corruption agenda at home and to encourage Russian President Putin to take seriously President Zelensky\u2019s peace efforts.\u201d By late summer, Mr. Holmes testified, he had a \u201cclear impression\u201d that a hold on the military aid was also \u201clikely intended by the president either to express dissatisfaction that the Ukrainians had not yet agreed to the Burisma/Biden investigations or as an effort to increase the pressure on them to do so.\u201d Mr. Holmes also described frustrations among American officials. At one point, he said, Mr. Sondland vented: \u201cDammit, Rudy. Every time Rudy gets involved he goes and f\u2014s everything up.\u201d He said that John R. Bolton, the president\u2019s former national security adviser, openly discussed strategies for marginalizing Mr. Giuliani on a trip to Kiev during the summer. Mr. Holmes testified that he also complained about Mr. Sondland\u2019s \u201cexpansive interpretation of his mandate.\u201d And he recalled Mr. Bolton saying that a hold on the security assistance would be lifted only if Mr. Zelensky could \u201cfavorably impress\u201d during a face-to-face meeting scheduled for early September. The meeting never happened. Other witnesses have described similar concerns by Mr. Bolton, and investigators would like to speak with him, but he has declined to appear given White House orders not to.",

      "author": "Adam Liptak",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump asked the Supreme Court on Friday to shield his financial records from disclosure to investigators for the second time in two days. His latest request was an emergency application that asked the court to temporarily block the release of records held by his accounting firm to a House committee while the justices consider whether to hear his appeal. That stay application followed a petition on Thursday in a separate case in which prosecutors in Manhattan are seeking eight years of Mr. Trump\u2019s business and personal tax returns. The prosecutors in that case had agreed not to seek immediate release of the records in exchange for a prompt request for Supreme Court review. There is no such agreement in the case arising from the House subpoena. If the justices do not grant a stay, the accounting firm, Mazars USA, has indicated that it will comply with the subpoena. If the justices do grant a stay, they may act on the requests for review in the two cases at the same time. Jay Sekulow, one of the president\u2019s lawyers, said the novelty of the House committee\u2019s subpoena warranted a stay from the Supreme Court. \u201cFor the first time in our nation\u2019s history, \u201c he said in a statement, \u201cCongress has subpoenaed the personal records of a sitting president from before he was in office. And, for the first time in our nation\u2019s history, a court upheld a congressional subpoena to the president for his personal papers.\u201d If the Supreme Court does not act by Wednesday, the stay application said, the requested information will be disclosed and the court will be left with nothing to review. Courts granted stays in earlier cases seeking evidence from sitting presidents in United States v. Nixon in 1974 and Clinton v. Jones in 1997.  In those cases, the Supreme Court ultimately rejected claims of immunity for Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Bill Clinton by unanimous votes. The new case started after the House Oversight and Reform Committee learned that Mr. Trump\u2019s ethics disclosure forms did not list a debt for hush-money payments made in the run-up to the 2016 election. Mr. Trump and his company reimbursed the president\u2019s former lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, for payments to the pornographic film actress Stormy Daniels, who said she had an affair with Mr. Trump. The president has denied the relationship. Mr. Cohen also told the committee that Mr. Trump had inflated and deflated descriptions of his assets on financial statements to obtain loans and reduce his taxes. Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers went to court to try to block the subpoena. They argued that the committee was powerless to obtain his records because it had no legislative need for them. They said the panel was engaged in an improper criminal inquiry and was not seeking information to help it enact legislation. \u201cWhile a legislative investigation is not illegitimate because it might incidentally expose illegal conduct,\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers told the Supreme Court, \u201ca law-enforcement investigation does not become legitimate just because it incidentally might inspire remedial legislation.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers added that the full House of Representatives had not authorized the committee\u2019s subpoena. Lawyers for the committee responded that the records were needed for multiple, proper reasons, that courts should not second-guess congressional decision-making and that the committee had the authority to issue subpoenas without separate authorization by the full House. In October, a divided three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit refused to block the subpoena. \u201cHaving considered the weighty interests at stake in this case, we conclude that the subpoena issued by the committee to Mazars is valid and enforceable,\u201d Judge David S. Tatel, who was appointed by President Clinton, wrote for the majority. Judge Patricia A. Millett, appointed by President Barack Obama, joined the majority opinion. In dissent, Judge Neomi J. Rao, appointed by Mr. Trump. wrote that \u201callegations of illegal conduct against the President cannot be investigated by Congress except through impeachment.\u201d On Wednesday, the full District of Columbia Circuit refused to rehear the panel\u2019s ruling. The three judges who noted dissents were appointed by Republican presidents. The committee\u2019s case may have been strengthened in the interim by the House\u2019s vote to conduct a formal impeachment inquiry, as congressional authority to seek information in that context is quite broad. In a second dissent on Wednesday, Judge Rao said the resolution did not alter the calculus. \u201cThis circuit,\u201d she wrote, \u201chas not determined whether a defective subpoena can be revived by after-the-fact approval.\u201d In any event, she wrote, the relevant House resolution did not retroactively endorse the earlier subpoena. In a footnote in Friday\u2019s emergency application, Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers said the House committee had not invoked the impeachment inquiry in arguments before the three-judge appeals court panel, suggesting that it was too late to do so now.",

      "author": "Sheryl Gay Stolberg",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 The former United States ambassador to Ukraine told the House impeachment inquiry on Friday that she felt threatened by President Trump and \u201cshocked, appalled, devastated\u201d that he vilified her in a call with another foreign leader, as Mr. Trump attacked her in real time on Twitter, drawing a stern warning about witness intimidation from Democrats. The extraordinary back-and-forth unfolded on the second day of public impeachment hearings as Marie L. Yovanovitch, who was ousted as the envoy to Ukraine on Mr. Trump\u2019s orders, detailed an unsettling campaign by the president\u2019s allies to undermine her as she pushed to promote democracy and the rule of law. In deeply personal terms, Ms. Yovanovitch described to the House Intelligence Committee how Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, worked hand in hand with a corrupt Ukrainian prosecutor to circumvent official channels, smear her and push her out of her job. Her testimony came amid only the third impeachment inquiry in modern United States history. It drew a spontaneous standing ovation and a loud round of applause from spectators, and capped a revealing first week of public hearings as Democrats seek to make their case that Mr. Trump abused his power to enlist Ukraine\u2019s help in discrediting his political rivals, chiefly former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. Speaker Nancy Pelosi this week called it \u201cbribery,\u201d echoing the language in the Constitution that describes impeachable offenses. Shortly after Ms. Yovanovitch finished speaking, another witness revealed a potentially crucial episode in the impeachment inquiry. An official from the United States Embassy in Kiev told investigators in a private interview that he overheard a call in July between Mr. Trump and Gordon D. Sondland, a Trump ally and the ambassador to the European Union, in which the president loudly asked about \u201cinvestigations\u201d he sought from Ukraine, according to three people familiar with the closed-door session. The official, David Holmes \u2014 who worked for Ms. Yovanovitch in Kiev \u2014 overheard Mr. Sondland telling Mr. Trump that President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine \u201cloves your ass,\u201d and would conduct the investigations and do \u201canything you ask him to,\u201d according to two of the people, all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity because they did not have authorization to describe the testimony. Mr. Holmes testified that Mr. Sondland told him afterward that the president cared more about the investigations, which affected him personally, than he did about Ukraine. Ms. Yovanovitch\u2019s public testimony, which played out over more than five hours in a packed and hushed House Ways and Means Committee Room, was an indictment of foreign policy in the Trump era, outlining the harm to American diplomacy and national security by a president who embraced false claims to target his own officials representing the United States overseas. \u201cEverywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter, at the very moment that Ms. Yovanovitch was testifying about having felt threatened by the president. \u201cShe started off in Somalia, how did that go? Then fast forward to Ukraine, where the new Ukrainian President spoke unfavorably about her in my second phone call with him. It is a U.S. President\u2019s absolute right to appoint ambassadors.\u201d Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, interrupted his counsel\u2019s questioning to read the president\u2019s words aloud to Ms. Yovanovitch and to ask for her reaction. There were audible gasps in the room as he did so. \u201cIt\u2019s very intimidating,\u201d she replied, taken aback. To that, Mr. Schiff replied gravely, \u201cSome of us here take witness intimidation very, very seriously.\u201d Democrats said Mr. Trump\u2019s comments were clear attempts by the president to intimidate a crucial witness in the impeachment inquiry and do the same to others who might yet come forward. They argued that the comments could constitute grounds for an article of impeachment against Mr. Trump. At the White House, Mr. Trump angrily denied the charge. \u201cI want freedom of speech,\u201d he told reporters, lashing out at Democrats for conducting what he called an unfair impeachment process. \u201cIt\u2019s considered a joke all over Washington and all over the world,\u201d Mr. Trump said of the proceedings, claiming after hours of tweeting about it that he had watched only \u201ca little bit\u201d of the hearing. His press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, later issued a statement deeming the session \u201cuseless and inconsequential,\u201d and saying it had produced \u201czero evidence of any wrongdoing by the president.\u201d Determined to avoid looking as if they were bullying Ms. Yovanovitch, Republicans gave the lone Republican woman on the committee, Representative Elise Stefanik of New York, a prominent role in questioning her. Unlike the president, they refrained from attacking Ms. Yovanovitch, even as they dismissed her as irrelevant to the allegations at the heart of the impeachment inquiry. Representative Devin Nunes of California, the ranking Republican on the committee, called her removal an \u201cemployment disagreement.\u201d Other Republicans argued that her removal did not change American policy, that her career was not permanently damaged and that the president had well-founded reasons to be concerned about corruption in Ukraine. Still, the session was tense at times, as Republicans \u2014 who have for weeks accused Mr. Schiff of running roughshod over them \u2014 made parliamentary points that the chairman, banging his gavel, repeatedly ruled out of order. And Ms. Yovanovitch, soft-spoken and calm, showed little hesitation in challenging her Republican interrogators. \u201cI do wonder why it was necessary to smear my reputation,\u201d she said at one point, addressing Representative Brad Wenstrup, Republican of Ohio, noting that Mr. Trump had the authority to remove her at will. Mr. Wenstrup cut her off, saying, \u201cWell I wasn\u2019t asking you about that, so thank you very much, ma\u2019am.\u201d Ms. Yovanovitch\u2019s testimony did not go precisely to the heart of the Democrats\u2019 case against Mr. Trump; she had left Ukraine by the time Mr. Trump asked Mr. Zelensky in a phone call on July 25 to \u201cdo us a favor\u201d and look into Mr. Biden and his son Hunter Biden. But Democrats argued that there was a direct line between Ms. Yovanovitch\u2019s ouster and Mr. Trump\u2019s Ukraine pressure campaign. Mr. Trump, they noted, brought up Ms. Yovanovitch himself during the call \u2014 shortly after he praised a corrupt Ukrainian prosecutor who had balked at her efforts to root out corruption, and shortly before he raised the Bidens. The president told Mr. Zelensky that she was \u201cbad news,\u201d and said that she was going to \u201cgo through some things,\u201d a comment that Ms. Yovanovitch told the committee had taken her breath away when she read a reconstructed transcript of the call. She testified that the color drained from her face and that she was \u201cshocked, appalled, devastated that the president of the United States would talk about any ambassador like that to a foreign head of state \u2014 and it was me. I mean, I couldn\u2019t believe it.\u201d \u201cIt sounded like a threat,\u201d Ms. Yovanovitch added. Ms. Yovanovitch was recalled from Ukraine abruptly in May. She told lawmakers that she learned she was being pulled back two months earlier than planned from the deputy secretary of state John J. Sullivan, who called her while she was hosting an \u201cInternational Women of Courage\u201d event honoring a Ukrainian anticorruption activist who died after having acid thrown at her. She said Mr. Sullivan relayed \u201cwords that every Foreign Service officer understands: \u2018The president has lost confidence in you.\u2019\u201d \u201cThat was a terrible thing to hear,\u201d she added. In an impassioned defense of the State Department and the career Foreign Service officers who work \u2014 and sometimes give their lives \u2014 to advance the interests of the United States, Ms. Yovanovitch recounted the months that preceded her ouster. During that time, she became the target of a smear campaign led by Mr. Giuliani, two of his associates \u2014 Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who have since been indicted on a scheme to violate campaign finance laws \u2014 and the right-wing news media. She spoke of her astonishment at how the men, working with a corrupt Ukrainian prosecutor who opposed her efforts to promote the rule of law in the country, were ultimately able to turn Mr. Trump against her. \u201cPerhaps it was not surprising that when our anticorruption efforts got in the way of the desire for profit or power, Ukrainians who preferred to play by the old, corrupt rules sought to remove me,\u201d Ms. Yovanovitch said. \u201cWhat continues to amaze me is that they found Americans willing to partner with them and, working together, they apparently succeeded in orchestrating the removal of the U.S. ambassador.\u201d \u201cHow could our system fail like this?\u201d she wondered aloud. \u201cHow is it that foreign corrupt interests could manipulate our government?\u201d And when her State Department colleagues pressed for Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to issue a statement defending her, she testified, they were rebuffed because of \u201cconcerns on the seventh floor\u201d \u2014 the floor where Mr. Pompeo has his suite of offices \u2014 that it could be undermined by Mr. Trump in a tweet. But Ms. Yovanovitch cast her own personal ordeal as far less important than the sweeping implications Mr. Trump\u2019s actions had for the United States\u2019 national security and the delicate balance of geopolitical forces operating in and around Ukraine, a struggling democracy and \u201cbattleground for great power competition\u201d ever since the Russians invaded five years ago. With the right support from the United States, Ms. Yovanovitch testified, Ukraine \u201ccould move out of Russia\u2019s orbit.\u201d But she said it was even more critical that Ukraine root out the lasting Soviet legacy of corruption, which undercuts the country\u2019s reliability as a strategic and trading partner of the United States \u2014 and only strengthens the hand of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Known as Masha to her friends, Ms. Yovanovitch, a Canadian immigrant whose parents fled the Soviet Union and Nazis, was known as a vigorous fighter against corruption in Ukraine. She has become a hero to her colleagues in the diplomatic corps, and the hashtag #GoMasha has sprung up on Twitter. Republicans did not try to undercut her credibility, but they did try to prove an unsubstantiated theory that Ukrainian officials conspired with Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign to interfere in the election at Mr. Trump\u2019s expense. Ms. Yovanovitch pushed back on the assertion. \u201cWe all know that people are critical,\u201d she said after Steve Castor, a lawyer for the Republicans, pointed to disparaging statements that a Ukrainian official had made about Mr. Trump during the campaign. \u201cThat does not mean that someone, or a government, is undermining either a campaign or interfering in elections.\u201d \u201cAnd I would just remind you again,\u201d she went on, \u201cthat our own U.S. intelligence community has conclusively determined that those who interfered in the election were in Russia.\u201d",

Made in Russia, U.S. Spies Assert|November 23, 2019, Page A1",
      "author": "Julian E. Barnes",
      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 Republicans have sought for weeks amid the impeachment inquiry to shift attention to President Trump\u2019s demands that Ukraine investigate any 2016 election meddling, defending it as a legitimate concern while Democrats accuse Mr. Trump of pursuing fringe theories for his benefit. The Republican defense of Mr. Trump became central to the impeachment proceedings when Fiona Hill, a respected Russia scholar and former senior White House official, added a harsh critique during testimony on Thursday. She told some of Mr. Trump\u2019s fiercest defenders in Congress that they were repeating \u201ca fictional narrative.\u201d She said that it likely came from a disinformation campaign by Russian security services, which also propagated it. In a briefing that closely aligned with Dr. Hill\u2019s testimony, American intelligence officials informed senators and their aides in recent weeks that Russia had engaged in a yearslong campaign to essentially frame Ukraine as responsible for Moscow\u2019s own hacking of the 2016 election, according to three American officials. The briefing came as Republicans stepped up their defenses of Mr. Trump in the Ukraine affair. The revelations demonstrate Russia\u2019s persistence in trying to sow discord among its adversaries \u2014 and show that the Kremlin apparently succeeded, as unfounded claims about Ukrainian interference seeped into Republican talking points. American intelligence agencies believe Moscow is likely to redouble its efforts as the 2020 presidential campaign intensifies. The classified briefing for senators also focused on Russia\u2019s evolving influence tactics, including its growing ability to better disguise operations. Russia has engaged in a \u201clong pattern of deflection\u201d to pin blame for its malevolent acts on other countries, Dr. Hill said, not least Ukraine, a former Soviet republic. Since Ukraine won independence in 1991, Russia has tried to reassert influence there, meddling in its politics, maligning pro-Western leaders and accusing Ukrainian critics of Moscow of fascist leanings. \u201cThe Russians have a particular vested interest in putting Ukraine, Ukrainian leaders in a very bad light,\u201d she told lawmakers. But the campaign by Russian intelligence in recent years has been even more complex as Moscow tries not only to undermine the government in Kyiv but also to use a disinformation campaign there to influence the American political debate. The accusations of a Ukrainian influence campaign center on actions by a handful of Ukrainians who openly criticized or sought to damage Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy in 2016. They were scattershot efforts that were far from a replica of Moscow\u2019s interference, when President Vladimir V. Putin ordered military and intelligence operatives to mount a broad campaign to sabotage the American election. The Russians in 2016 conducted covert operations to hack Democratic computers and to use social media to exploit divisions among Americans. This time, Russian intelligence operatives deployed a network of agents to blame Ukraine for its 2016 interference. Starting at least in 2017, the operatives peddled a mixture of now-debunked conspiracy theories along with established facts to leave an impression that the government in Kyiv, not Moscow, was responsible for the hackings of Democrats and its other interference efforts in 2016, senior intelligence officials said. The Russian intelligence officers conveyed the information to prominent Russians and Ukrainians who then used a range of intermediaries, like oligarchs, businessmen and their associates, to pass the material to American political figures and even some journalists, who were likely unaware of its origin, the officials said. That muddy brew worked its way into American information ecosystems, sloshing around until parts of it reached Mr. Trump, who has also spoken with Mr. Putin about allegations of Ukrainian interference. Mr. Trump also brought up the assertions of Ukrainian meddling in his July 25 call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, which is at the heart of the impeachment inquiry into whether he abused his power by asking for a public commitment to investigations he stood to gain from personally. Mr. Trump referred elliptically to allegations that Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election and brought up a related conspiracy theory. Asking Mr. Zelensky to \u201cdo us a favor,\u201d Mr. Trump added, \u201cI would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine.\u201d Russia\u2019s operation to blame Ukraine has become more relevant as Republicans have tried to focus public debate during the impeachment inquiry on any Ukrainian role in the 2016 campaign, American officials said. Republicans have denounced any suggestion that their concerns about Ukrainian meddling are without merit or that they are ignoring Russia\u2019s broader interference. \u201cNot a single Republican member of this committee said Russia did not meddle in the 2016 elections,\u201d Representative Elise Stefanik, Republican of New York, said Thursday. Indeed, Ms. Stefanik and her Republican colleagues on the Democratic-led House Intelligence Committee, which is conducting the impeachment hearing, have also steered clear of the fringe notion that Mr. Trump mentioned to Mr. Zelensky, which is pushed by Russian intelligence: the so-called CrowdStrike server conspiracy theory, which falsely suggests Ukraine, not Russia, was behind the breach of Democratic operatives\u2019 servers. Mr. Trump repeated the baseless claim on Friday in an interview with \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d laying out the narrative and doubling down after a host gently pressed him on whether he was sure of one aspect of the debunked theory, that the F.B.I. gave a Democratic server to what Mr. Trump had inaccurately described as a Ukrainian-owned company. \u201cThat is what the word is,\u201d Mr. Trump replied. Some Republicans have also focused on Hunter Biden, raising questions about whether his hiring by the Ukrainian energy company Burisma was corrupt. Burisma hired Mr. Biden while his father, former Vice President Joseph Biden Jr., a potential rival of Mr. Trump\u2019s in the 2020 election, was leading the Obama administration\u2019s Ukraine policy. On the July 25 call, Mr. Trump also demanded Mr. Zelensky investigate Burisma and Hunter Biden. Moscow has long used its intelligence agencies and propaganda machine to muddy the waters of public debate, casting doubts over established facts. In her testimony, Dr. Hill noted Russia\u2019s pattern of trying to blame other countries for its own actions, like the attempted poisoning last year of a former Russian intelligence officer or the downing of a passenger jet over Ukraine in 2014. Moscow\u2019s goal is to cast doubt on established facts, said current and former officials. \u201cThe strategy is simply to create the impression that it is not really possible to know who was really behind it,\u201d said Laura Rosenberger, the director of the Alliance for Securing Democracy, which tracks Russian disinformation efforts. Although American intelligence agencies have made no formal classified assessment about the Russian disinformation campaign against Ukraine, officials at several of the agencies have broadly agreed for some time that Russian intelligence services have embraced tactics to shift responsibility for the 2016 interference campaign away from themselves, officials said. Russia has relentlessly tried to deflect attention since the allegations of its interference campaign in the 2016 election first surfaced, one official said. Mr. Putin began publicly pushing false theories of Ukrainian interference in the early months of 2017 to deflect responsibility from Russia, said Senator Angus King, independent of Maine and a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, who declined to answer questions about the briefing. \u201cThese people are pros at this,\u201d said Mr. King, who caucuses with the Democrats. \u201cThe Soviet Union used disinformation for 70 years. This is nothing new. Vladimir Putin is a former K.G.B. agent. He is trained in deception. This is his stock and trade and he is doing it well.\u201d During a news conference in February 2017, Mr. Putin accused the Ukrainian government of supporting Hillary Clinton during the previous American election and funding her candidacy with friendly oligarchs. It is not clear when American intelligence agencies learned about Moscow\u2019s campaign or when precisely it began. Russian intelligence officers aimed part of their operation at prompting the Ukrainian authorities to investigate the allegations that people in Ukraine tried to tamper with the 2016 American election and to shut down inquiries into corruption by pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine, according to a former official. One target was the leak of a secret ledger disclosed by a Ukrainian law enforcement agency that appeared to show that Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump\u2019s onetime campaign chairman, had taken illicit payments from Ukrainian politicians who were close to Moscow. He was forced to step down from the Trump campaign after the ledger became public in August 2016, and the Russians have since been eager to cast doubt on its authenticity, the former official said. Intelligence officials believe that one of the people the Kremlin relied on to spread disinformation about Ukrainian interference was Oleg V. Deripaska, a Russian oligarch who had ties to Mr. Manafort. After his ouster from the campaign, Mr. Manafort told his former deputy later in 2016 that Ukrainians, not Russians, stole Democratic emails. Mr. Deripaska has broadly denied any role in election meddling. \u201cThere is a long history of Russians putting out fake information,\u201d said Marc Polymeropoulos, a former senior C.I.A. official. \u201cNow they are trying to put out theories that they think are damaging to the United States.\u201d",

Barnes, Eric Schmitt and Thomas Gibbons-NeffPRINT EDITIONTrump and the Pentagon Find a Way to Make It Work|November 15, 2019, Page A9",
      "author": "Helene Cooper",
      "content": "    WASHINGTON \u2014 Days after President Trump\u2019s abrupt decision to withdraw 1,000 American troops from Syria, Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, saw a way to turn it around. The businessman in Mr. Trump had focused on the Syrian oil fields that, if left unprotected, could fall into the hands of the Islamic State \u2014 or Russia or Iran. So General Milley proposed to a receptive Mr. Trump that American commandos, along with allied Syrian Kurdish fighters, guard the oil. Today, 800 American troops remain in Syria. \u201cWe\u2019re keeping the oil,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters on Wednesday before his meeting with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey. \u201cWe left troops behind, only for the oil.\" That is a far cry from where Mr. Trump was last month, when he ordered the withdrawal of all American troops from northern Syria. But now, for the second time in less than a year, the Pentagon has softened the president\u2019s initial decision. \u201cI credit Milley with convincing the president to modify his Syria decision,\u201d said Jack Keane, the former Army vice chief of staff, who spoke several times with Mr. Trump and General Milley last month during the frenzied days of the president\u2019s zigzagging Syria policy. Nearly three years into the Trump presidency, the Pentagon is learning how to manage a capricious president whose orders can whipsaw by the hour. Top Defense Department officials have acquired their education the hard way, through Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter bullying of Iran and North Korea, letdown of allies in Syria, harsh attacks on the Atlantic alliance and public support for commandos the military has charged with war crimes. Mr. Trump, top Pentagon officials say, is unpredictable, frustrating and overly focused on spectacles like military parades. But there is much these officials like about the president. They are happy with the annual budget boost he gave them \u2014 to $716 billion this year from $585 billion in 2016 \u2014 and are pleased he has done away with what they considered micromanaging by Obama White House officials. Mr. Trump has also given commanders in combat zones a far freer hand to conduct raids. And among a big portion of the rank and file, those service members who mirror Mr. Trump\u2019s conservative base, he remains very popular. In many ways, the American military remains the part of the government most responsive to the president across a large and fractious administration, because civilian control of the armed forces is embedded in the Constitution and the psyche of every soldier. But for Mr. Trump, the other side of that coin is that the military respects the coequal branches of government, as Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman demonstrated in recent days when, against the wishes of the president, he testified in the House impeachment proceeding. Once Mr. Trump took office, he gave the Pentagon and military commanders more running room. He allowed the Pentagon to speed up decision-making so the military could move faster on raids, airstrikes, bombing missions and arming allies in Iraq, Syria and elsewhere. The Pentagon, after eight years of chafing at what many generals viewed as the slow decision-making and second-guessing by the Obama White House, at first embraced the new commander in chief. But with the new freedom came repercussions. Mr. Trump deflected blame onto the Pentagon if things went wrong. After a botched raid in Yemen in January 2017, which led to the death of Chief Petty Officer William Owens, a member of the Navy SEALs known as Ryan, Mr. Trump appeared to blame the military \u2014 a stunning departure from previous presidents, who as commanders in chief have traditionally accepted responsibility for military operations that they ordered. \u201cThey explained what they wanted to do, the generals, who are very respected,\u201d Mr. Trump told Fox News after the raid. \u201cAnd they lost Ryan.\u201d On another issue important to the Pentagon, Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper and the Army secretary, Ryan McCarthy, have reached out quietly to Mr. Trump in recent days to ask that he not interfere in several war crimes cases. Defense Department officials are concerned that presidential pardons could undermine discipline across the ranks. The Army, for instance, is prosecuting a Green Beret, Maj. Mathew L. Golsteyn, in the killing of a man linked to the Taliban in Afghanistan; Mr. Trump has indicated he may pardon him. \u201cI do have full confidence in the military justice system,\u201d Mr. Esper told reporters. And in the case of Syria, the Pentagon gave Mr. Trump an unexpected gift in return: the American commando raid that led to the death of the Islamic State leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, which so elated the president that he tweeted the news as soon as American troops were out of harm\u2019s way. The next day, Mr. Trump triumphantly mentioned General Milley four times during his 48-minute news conference on the raid, calling him \u201cincredible\u201d for his work and thanking him by name before any other senior administration officials. Commanders have also learned to carefully parse their comments, wary of having their words construed as subtle criticism of the president. During a news conference, Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr., the head of the United States Central Command, declined to repeat Mr. Trump\u2019s assertion that the Islamic State leader was \u201cwhimpering\u201d before he detonated his suicide vest after American troops raided his compound. But General McKenzie backed up Mr. Trump\u2019s characterization of Mr. al-Baghdadi as a coward. \u201cHe crawled into a hole with two small children, blew himself up,\u201d the general said. \u201cSo, you can deduce what kind of person it is based on that activity.\u201d Defense Department officials also make sure to speak more frequently about how important it is to get North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies in Europe to \u201cpay their fair share,\u201d echoing Mr. Trump\u2019s more transactional view of how that alliance should proceed. By emphasizing payment, rather than simply saying that the Pentagon wants European governments to bolster their own internal military budgets \u2014 a more accurate description of NATO policy \u2014 American officials couch something they wanted anyway in language that will appeal to the president. On the Korean Peninsula, the United States and South Korea have continued to conduct joint military exercises despite Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement that such \u201cwar games\u201d be suspended pending nuclear negotiations with North Korea. Stopping the exercises completely, Defense Department officials say, would hurt military readiness in the event the United States does end up at war with the North. The military now conducts them at a smaller scale level and no longer makes them public. In Afghanistan, Gen. Austin S. Miller, the commander of the war effort there, is preparing to shrink the American presence. Mr. Trump has said he wants all the troops withdrawn, but has given no timetable. General Miller now has plans that could reduce the number of American forces in Afghanistan to 8,600 troops, from roughly 12,000 to 13,000 \u2014 a move, American officials say, that will allow Mr. Trump to say in his 2020 re-election campaign that he is bringing the troops home. But it will leave what commanders consider an adequate number on the ground. The relationship between Mr. Trump and the military has been the most fraught over Syria policy. The problems began last December, when Mr. Trump first tried to bring what were then 2,000 American troops home from Syria and Jim Mattis, his first defense secretary, resigned in protest. In the storm that followed \u2014 Republicans, Democrats and some of Mr. Trump\u2019s own advisers said he was pulling out of the fight before the Islamic State was defeated for good \u2014 Mr. Trump backtracked and agreed to leave some 1,000 American forces. But over the past year, Pentagon officials let them operate almost in secret to avoid calling attention to the fact that Defense Department officials had talked the president out of his initial order. In early October, after a phone call with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, Mr. Trump signaled he had had enough, and announced he was pulling out those remaining troops. Once again there was another outcry from Republicans, Democrats and Mr. Trump\u2019s own national security advisers, who said he was paving the way for a Turkish offensive against the United States\u2019 longtime allies, Kurdish fighters, who had carried the brunt of the fight against the Islamic State. In particular, the military did not want to abandon the Kurds. \u201cThe idea of walking away from that sacrifice, that is something that really bothers,\u201d said Representative Mac Thornberry, Republican of Texas and the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee. \u201cYou want to salute and follow the orders of the duly elected political authorities, but you also don\u2019t want to betray the sacrifice of your comrades. That puts the military, at least their hearts, in a tough place.\u201d \u201cThe decision to betray the Kurds punches a huge hole in the current way we fight terrorists which is by, with and through allies,\u201d said Representative Elissa Slotkin, a Michigan Democrat on the Armed Services Committee and a former senior Pentagon official. General Milley, along with Mr. Esper, looked quickly at how to yet again make the case to Mr. Trump that American forces still had work to do in Syria. The military\u2019s Central Command had drafted two alternate plans. One proposal would have kept a small force to help control a small swath of the border between Iraq and Syria, about 10 percent of the area. Another option would try to keep control of a larger part of the country \u2014 more than half of the area the American and Kurdish fighters currently controlled. But after Mr. Trump told General Milley he wanted to keep the oil fields, the Pentagon quickly \u201coperationalized\u201d a new plan wrapped around using American forces and their Kurdish allies to protect the oil and to keep it from falling into the hands of the Islamic State, officials said. From Brussels, where he was attending a NATO meeting, Mr. Esper was on the phone with General Milley completing details of the new plan. General Milley, for his part, has been advised by friends to maintain a low profile, and not to appear to be contradicting Mr. Trump\u2019s decisions or strategy. Known for long monologues, General Milley has also learned to be concise with Mr. Trump, offering clear opinions but allowing the president to dominate the conversation. By the end of October, Mr. Trump was on board with the Pentagon plan. At Game 5 of the World Series, he was in one of the luxury boxes at Nationals Park surrounded by Republican members of Congress and top aides. The conversation turned to Syria. Mr. Trump talked about how he was revising his plans for Syria, repeatedly telling lawmakers that American forces would remain there. Why? Because America was \u201ckeeping the oil.\u201d Senior military and Defense Department officials say that in some cases, it is simply a matter of talking in a way that will appeal to Mr. Trump, while prosecuting a similar national security policy as they did under President Barack Obama. \u201cThe Pentagon has figured out that they can couch things to manage Trump\u2019s biases in some ways,\u201d said Derek Chollet, a former assistant secretary of defense in the Obama administration. \u201cDon\u2019t make it about saving the Kurds, make it about saving the oil.\u201d At the moment, the Pentagon is left trying to continue the strategy in a patchwork fashion, with General Milley\u2019s move to keep American troops in Syria helping Kurdish fighters protect oil fields the latest piece.",

      "author": "Vanessa Swales",
      "content": " Craig Silverman had clearly worn out his welcome on KNUS, a conservative talk-radio station in Denver. Midway through his three-hour show on Saturday, after a segment criticizing President Trump, the station suddenly cut away to a news report, and the station\u2019s operations manager walked into the studio and told Mr. Silverman, \u201cYou\u2019re done.\u201d But it was less clear which had bothered his employers more \u2014 the negative views of Mr. Trump that he voiced on the air, or the fact that he had also gone on competing stations\u2019 programs to express them. Like many talk-show hosts, Mr. Silverman, a lawyer and former chief deputy district attorney, likes to debate and push boundaries. His constant on-air arguments with a co-host, Dan Caplis, helped make the duo\u2019s former show on another Denver station one of the most popular in the city. But Mr. Silverman said in an interview on Sunday that he sees himself as an independent analyst, not a partisan conservative \u2014 and that may have made him increasingly unwelcome at KNUS. Mr. Silverman said the station\u2019s owner, the Salem Media Group, which focuses on conservative and Christian programming, is \u201c100 percent behind Donald Trump.\u201d Neither Salem Media nor the operations manager at KNUS, Kelly Michaels, responded to requests on Sunday for comment. Mr. Silverman said he supported Mr. Trump in 2016, taking a chance that he would shake things up for the better in Washington. But after seeing Mr. Trump\u2019s performance in office, he said, he \u201cstepped back off the Trump train\u201d and rebranded his show as the \u201cIsland of Independence.\u201d As the investigations of Mr. Trump and his associates accelerated toward an impeachment inquiry, he said, he tried to concentrate on discussing the facts objectively, \u201cand not go down various rabbit holes or engage in any what-about-isms.\u201d The station management never told him what to say on the air, Mr. Silverman said. But he started to notice that the other hosts on the station gradually stopped inviting him to appear on their shows. He said he thought it was because he was the \u201conly non-Trumpster.\u201d \u201cI think it makes great radio when people can disagree,\u201d he said. \u201cBut something about Trump and impeachment \u2014 my colleagues don\u2019t want to discuss it, and they don\u2019t want any disagreements.\u201d He said he became frustrated at feeling frozen out on KNUS. \u201cI expressed myself on Twitter, but I was hoping to be able to express myself on my own radio station, but that wasn\u2019t available,\u201d said Mr. Silverman. \u201cSo, other media outlets asked me on.\u201d He said that angered the station\u2019s managers, who warned him last week that if he continued to speak on competing shows, his job would be jeopardy. \u201cI canceled going on, and then I met with them on Thursday,\u201d Mr. Silverman said. \u201cI explained that under my contract, I have a right to go on other media. And they said, well, we don\u2019t want you to do it.\u201d In addition to dropping Mr. Silverman from the air, KNUS has also apparently removed all of his content from its website, including more than five years\u2019 worth of podcasts. Elizabeth Skewes, a professor at the University of Colorado-Boulder who teaches media law and ethics, said that while \u201cto some degree, Craig Silverman was doing what he was hired to do, express his opinion,\u201d the station was well within its rights to dismiss him if it no longer wanted to put those opinions on the air. The First Amendment protects free speech only from government censorship, she said, not from private business decisions. Even so, she said, she saw it as part of a problematic trend. \u201cWe\u2019ve become less tolerant of alternative viewpoints as media has become more polarized,\u201d Professor Skewes said. \u201cThe more narrow it gets, the worse off we are as a democracy.\u201d Others working in broadcasting have seen their careers abruptly deflected over whether they were supportive of Mr. Trump. When Jerry Bader, a conservative radio host in Green Bay, Wis., was fired in 2018 after 18 years at the station, he said it was over his criticism of the president. In October, the Fox News anchor Shepard Smith, who had frequently aired reports critical of Mr. Trump, abruptly resigned after publicly clashing with a staunchly pro-Trump host on the network, Tucker Carlson. And James Bunner, a reporter for KTTC-TV, an NBC affiliate in Rochester, Minn., was fired in October for wearing a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat while covering a Trump rally.",

      "author": "Rick Rojas",
      "content": "  BATON ROUGE, La. \u2014 Gov. John Bel Edwards of Louisiana, the only Democratic governor in the Deep South, narrowly won re-election Saturday, overcoming the intervention of President Trump, who visited the state multiple times in an effort to help Mr. Edwards\u2019s Republican challenger and demonstrate his own clout. It was the second blow at the ballot box for Mr. Trump this month in a Republican-leaning state, following the Democratic victory in the Kentucky governor\u2019s race, where the president also campaigned for the G.O.P. candidate. In Louisiana, Mr. Trump had wagered significant political capital to try to lift Eddie Rispone, a businessman who ran against Mr. Edwards in large part by embracing the president and his agenda. Mr. Trump campaigned for Mr. Rispone twice in the final two weeks of the race, warning Louisiana voters that a loss would reflect poorly on his presidency \u2014 the same appeal he made in Kentucky earlier this month to try to help Gov. Matt Bevin, who ultimately lost. Of the three governor\u2019s races this year, all in deep red states, Republicans won only one, in Mississippi. Republicans also lost control of both chambers of the state legislature in Virginia, where many Democratic candidates were sharply critical of Mr. Trump. The victory was a deeply personal one for Mr. Edwards, a conservative Democrat in a state and region where his party can often be a disqualifier in statewide races. He campaigned on his accomplishments in office, like balancing the budget, increasing education spending and expanding Medicaid. He also highlighted his conservative stances on abortion and guns and showcased his background as a West Point graduate and son of a sheriff, to appeal to right-leaning voters. In his victory speech, Mr. Edwards said, \u201cOur shared love for Louisiana is always more important than the partisan differences that sometimes divide us. And as for the president: God bless his heart.\u201d Before the election, Mr. Rispone, a construction magnate from Baton Rouge, had never before run for political office. He vaulted ahead after more prominent Republicans decided against running and became competitive against the governor after cloaking himself in Mr. Trump\u2019s popularity. The results indicated that many voters here were happy with the incumbent. And on a night when the attention of many Louisianans was split between the election and the football game between top-ranked Louisiana State and the University of Mississippi, Mr. Edwards ventured an explanation for why voters were comfortable re-electing him. \u201cIt is an easier state to govern when the Saints and LSU are winning,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cPeople are just in a better mood.\u201d Mr. Edwards received 51 percent of the vote, beating Mr. Rispone by some 40,000 votes. Mr. Rispone conceded the race, telling his supporters, \u201cI am disappointed, to be honest.\u201d \u201cWe have nothing to be ashamed of,\u201d he added. \u201cWe had more than 700,000 people in Louisiana want something better and want something different.\u201d Mr. Edwards\u2019s supporters, packed into a hotel ballroom in Baton Rouge, roared as they watched his vote total eclipse Mr. Rispone\u2019s, chanting \u201cJBE!\u201d and \u201cfour more years!\u201d And before Mr. Edwards addressed his supporters, a Roman Catholic priest led a prayer: \u201cSustain our governor, oh Lord.\u201d \u201cHow sweet it is!\u201d Mr. Edwards told the crowd. \u201c You didn\u2019t just vote for me. You voted for four more years of putting Louisiana first. You may have heard me say this once or twice that God will order our steps, but we have to move our feet, and you moved your feet \u2014 to the polls.\u201d   Republicans had succeeded during the state\u2019s all-party jungle primary last month in forcing Mr. Edwards into a runoff against Mr. Rispone, who came in second. The race then narrowed into a virtual dead heat, as Mr. Rispone closed the gap with a flood of support from Republicans, who poured millions of dollars into the campaign and brought in prominent figures, including, most notably, the president and Vice President Mike Pence. In a rally this week, Mr. Trump acknowledged the stakes, saying, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to give me a big win, O.K.?\u201d For Mr. Trump, the importance of the outcome grew considerably this week when his chosen candidate in Kentucky, Gov. Matt Bevin, conceded his race, which also hinged on whether he could depend on the president\u2019s clout to win. Mr. Trump had carried Louisiana by 20 percentage points in 2016, but his investment in the governor\u2019s race was still regarded as an unusual expenditure of his political capital in a state that is unlikely to be competitive in the presidential election next year. Republicans had viewed Mr. Edwards as vulnerable from the outset, and political analysts said that the governor was left in an even more precarious position as Mr. Trump leapt into the fray. Mr. Edwards faced \u201can opponent that has replaced what he hoped would be a referendum on his own incumbency with a narrative that is, more or less, a referendum on Donald Trump,\u201d said Mary-Patricia Wray, a political consultant who has worked for Democrats and Republicans, including Mr. Edwards during his 2015 campaign. The governor\u2019s success in a race that had been nationalized as a test for Mr. Trump, she added, offered \u201cproof that authenticity still counts for half a percent in red Louisiana.\u201d Mr. Edwards and Mr. Rispone entered the runoff after the state\u2019s nonpartisan primary in October, where Mr. Edwards came up shy of the 50 percent threshold needed to assure his re-election, receiving 46 percent of the vote. Mr. Rispone, with 27 percent, came in second place by edging past the Republican congressman Ralph Abraham. Throughout the campaign, Mr. Edwards, a rare Democrat holding statewide office in the South, shined a spotlight on his conservative bona fides, like his support for a state law barring abortion after the pulsing of what becomes the fetus\u2019s heart can be detected. He also campaigned on his role in closing a $2 billion deficit he inherited from his Republican predecessor, Bobby Jindal, and has argued that Mr. Rispone, by pursuing aggressive tax cuts, would put Louisiana back in the same place. And he distanced himself from national Democrats. One of his most influential megawatt backers has not been anyone from Washington, but instead Ed Orgeron, Louisiana State University\u2019s football coach. (\u201cI know the state of Louisiana believes in him just like a championship quarterback,\u201d the coach said at a fund-raiser in April.) Mr. Edwards has steadily refused to criticize Mr. Trump and indeed has seized every opportunity he could to visit the White House to burnish his image with conservatives. Yet he had no reservations about slamming Mr. Rispone for clinging to the president\u2019s coattails. \u201cIf he had a message that resonated with Louisiana voters, that was about Louisiana, he wouldn\u2019t need to try to nationalize the race,\u201d Mr. Edwards told reporters at a campaign stop in New Orleans this week. \u201cHe\u2019s an uninspiring candidate who doesn\u2019t know very much about how state government works.\u201d Still, Mr. Rispone, who founded with his brother an industrial engineering, construction and maintenance company in Baton Rouge, considered his neophyte status as a benefit rather than a deficiency, casting himself as a Trump-like candidate for Louisiana, putting his business experience to use for the state. Indeed, Mr. Rispone never passed on an opportunity to highlight his allegiance to the president. He opened his candidacy with an ad boasting of how he had a Trump bumper sticker on his pickup truck. He ran as much on the same national issues the president did, most notably illegal immigration, as he did anything connected to state government. And when Mr. Rispone addressed supporters at an election night gathering in October, he started his speech by saying he had just gotten off the phone with the president, leading the crowd to chant \u201cTrump!\u201d Mr. Rispone\u2019s first two ads in the runoff showed footage of Mr. Trump but none of the candidate. On Thursday, Mr. Trump traveled to Bossier City, La., near Shreveport in the northern part of the state, to renew his attack on Mr. Edwards and to urge the crowd to \u201csend a message to the corrupt Democrats in Washington\u201d by voting for Mr. Rispone. He reiterated his support for Mr. Rispone on Saturday with multiple tweets. Mr. Trump\u2019s support helped sway Michael Derouen, who works in seafood sales. He described both candidates as \u201cpretty decent,\u201d but ultimately, he sided with Mr. Rispone because he believed a change might jolt Louisiana forward and a strong relationship with the president would only offer more of a boost. \u201cHe\u2019s not just a politician,\u201d Mr. Derouen said just after voting at a fire station in East Baton Rouge Parish. \u201cHe\u2019s a businessman, which opens the door for us and the state. We want an all-around guy, not just a politician.\u201d While many voters acknowledged the influence Mr. Trump has had in the race, they also noted that it had the potential to motivate his detractors as much as his supporters. \u201cThis is about the power of the vote and about people in this state standing up and standing together to do what\u2019s right for this state,\u201d said the Rev. A. J. Johnson, a pastor at First Pilgrim Calvary Baptist, a predominantly African-American congregation in Geismar, southeast of Baton Rouge. \u201cIt\u2019s not about what a president thinks is right for this state.\u201d",

Schmidt and Nicholas FandosPRINT EDITIONWhere Statements Diverge From the Testimony of Others|November 20, 2019, Page A19",
      "author": "Michael S. Schmidt",
      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 Gordon D. Sondland, the American ambassador to the European Union, has emerged as a critical witness in the impeachment inquiry into President Trump\u2019s pressure campaign on Ukraine. But when he testifies before the House Intelligence Committee on Wednesday, he will have to answer for several inconsistencies that have emerged in his story so far. Mr. Sondland answered questions privately for more than nine hours in an interview last month with the House Intelligence Committee. Weeks later, he amended his testimony with a lengthy sworn statement. A hotelier and megadonor to Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration, he has emerged as a crucial player in Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to get Ukraine to announce investigations to discredit former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and other Democrats. His own statements have called into question his credibility, after several other witnesses have raised doubts about his candor. Here are the discrepancies between Mr. Sondland\u2019s account, his own revisions, and the testimony of others. A witness testified that Mr. Sondland told a top Ukrainian official that the military aid the country needed to defend itself from the Russians was tied to the Ukranians publicly committing to the investigations that Mr. Trump wanted. Timothy Morrison, a former top National Security Council official who dealt with Ukraine, said that Mr. Sondland told the Ukranians that \u201cthe prosecutor general would to go the mic and announce that he was opening\u201d an investigation into Burisma Holdings, the energy company whose board of directors at one point included Mr. Biden\u2019s son Hunter. Mr. Sondland testified that he \u201cnever\u201d thought there was any precondition on the aid. But two weeks later, he amended his testimony, saying he had indeed told the Ukrainians that the military aid was tied to the investigations. \u201cI said that resumption of the U.S. aid would likely not occur until Ukraine provided the public anticorruption statement that we had been discussing for many weeks,\u201d Mr. Sondland said in his new statement. It matters because Democrats are investigating how Mr. Trump sought to pressure the Ukrainians and who the president used to carry out the campaign. A muddy picture of how the administration sought to influence the Ukrainians makes getting to the bottom of that matter more difficult. A witness testified that Mr. Sondland had a phone call with Mr. Trump in July while at a restaurant in Kyiv. David Holmes, a diplomat at the American embassy in Kyiv, testified that he was sitting at an outdoor table with Mr. Sondland when he spoke to Mr. Trump about President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, and that he could hear Mr. Trump\u2019s voice. \u201cPresident Zelensky \u2018loves your ass,\u2019\u201d Mr. Holmes said he heard Mr. Sondland tell the president. \u201cI then heard President Trump ask, \u2018He\u2019s going to do the investigation?\u2019\u201d Mr. Holmes said. \u201c\u2019He\u2019s going to do it,\u2019\u201d Mr. Holmes said Mr. Sondland responded, adding that the ambassador said Mr. Zelensky would do whatever Mr. Trump wanted. Mr. Sondland testified that he spoke with Mr. Trump before Mr. Trump\u2019s July 25 call with Mr. Zelensky but made no mention of speaking with him the day after the call. \u201cAs I said, I spoke with President Trump before I got on the plane, I believe, to Kyiv and it was a nothing call,\u201d Mr. Sondland said. \u201cI said we\u2019re headed to Kyiv to go see Zelensky and he was like, \u2018Oh, great,\u2019 whatever. That was sort of the end of the call. We never discussed anything substantive.\u201d Mr. Sondland also testified: \u201cI think I called him and said I\u2019m headed to Kyiv to meet President Zelensky and Ambassador Volker. Is there anything you want me to share? And he just didn\u2019t want to discuss it. \u2018No, go. I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re going.\u2019 \u201d It matters because it shows that Mr. Sondland did not share key details with the committee that point to how enmeshed he had become in the efforts to convey to the Ukrainians Mr. Trump\u2019s desire for investigations he saw as politically advantageous. Witnesses testified that in a July meeting at the White House, Mr. Sondland told senior National Security Council staff and Ukrainian officials that the Ukrainians would have to commit to the investigations in order to receive an Oval Office meeting with Mr. Trump. \u201cWhat did you hear Sondland say?\u201d an impeachment investigator asked Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the council\u2019s top Ukraine expert. \u201cThat the Ukrainians would have to deliver an investigation into the Bidens,\u201d Colonel Vindman said. Mr. Sondland testified that he \u201cnever made the connection between Burisma and the Bidens until the very end.\u201d \u201cI heard the word \u2018Burisma,\u2019 but I didn\u2019t understand that Biden and Burisma were connected,\u201d Sondland said. \u201cAgain, I recall no discussions with any State Department or White House official about former Vice President Biden or his son. Nor do I recall taking part in any effort to encourage an investigation into the Bidens.\u201d It matters because it indicates that Mr. Sondland knew that the request from the president\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, for the Ukrainians to investigate Burisma Holdings was essentially political in nature, and not a product of more general concerns by the president about corruption in Ukraine, as Mr. Trump has insisted. A witness testified that Mr. Sondland suggested to Marie L. Yovanovitch, the former United States ambassador to Ukraine, that praising the president on Twitter would help after Mr. Giuliani and others publicly criticized her as disloyal to Mr. Trump. \u201cHe said, you know, \u2018You need to go big or go home. You need to, you know, tweet out there that you support the President, and that all these are lies and everything else,\u2019 \u201d she testified. Mr. Sondland testified  \u201cI honestly don\u2019t recall,\u201d when asked whether he had spoken with Ms. Yovanovitch about her job. It matters because Democrats are investigating why Mr. Trump pushed to have Ms. Yovanovitch removed as ambassador, and whether it had anything to do with his broader campaign to pressure Ukraine to pursue the investigations he wanted. Given Mr. Sondland\u2019s role in the efforts to lean on the Ukrainians, investigators want to know what he knew about Ms. Yovanovitch\u2019s effort to preserve her job and any involvement he had in those efforts.",

      "author": "Michael D. Shear",
      "content": "   WASHINGTON \u2014 The White House and the Republicans in the Senate, all but certain that the House will move forward to impeach President Trump, are divided over whether to embrace a lengthy trial that could give his allies a chance to mount an elaborate defense of his conduct before a polarized nation, or to move quickly to dispense with charges against him. Several Republican senators discussed the issue with some of Mr. Trump\u2019s top aides on Thursday during a meeting at the White House that unfolded as the House Intelligence Committee capped off two weeks of public impeachment hearings exploring whether the president should be impeached on charges of pressuring Ukraine to announce investigations into his political rivals. The group, which included some of Mr. Trump\u2019s closest allies in the Senate and his legal and political advisers, came to no final conclusions about what a person briefed on the matter said would be a \u201ctotally unpredictable\u201d situation as all of the senators meet in public session for only the third time in history to consider whether to remove a president from office. One White House official said nothing would be resolved until closer to the time of the actual trial. Another person familiar with the White House position said that they believe there should not be a vote in the House and that they considered the inquiry illegitimate, but that they welcomed the chance to present witnesses and try the case, which they cannot do in the current setting. Mr. Trump has told friends that he is eager to see Senate Republicans aggressively argue that he did nothing wrong, after an elaborate House impeachment proceeding that has featured a constant barrage of damaging Democratic allegations. But some lawmakers, including Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, are pushing for a quick trial \u2014 perhaps as short as two weeks, according to people familiar with the meeting. They hope that a brief proceeding would limit the political damage to Mr. Trump and quickly lead to his acquittal, allowing him and the Republican Party to focus on winning the 2020 election. Others believe that drawing a trial out for as long as a month early next year could bring political advantages to Republicans, especially if it forces several Democratic senators who are running for president to make a difficult choice between sitting in their seats during an impeachment trial or spending time with voters on the campaign trail in Iowa and New Hampshire. On Thursday, Mr. Graham sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo requesting documents that could signal which witnesses Republicans might call during an impeachment trial and how his allies might seek to defend the president. In the letter, Mr. Graham asked for documents and communications with former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., his son Hunter Biden, officials from the Obama administration and former President Petro O. Poroshenko of Ukraine. The list suggests that Mr. Graham envisions a defense of Mr. Trump that focuses on shifting attention away from Mr. Trump\u2019s conduct and onto the issue of whether Hunter Biden\u2019s work on the board of a Ukrainian energy company while his father was vice president was appropriate. House Republicans unsuccessfully tried to persuade the Democrats leading the impeachment inquiry to subpoena Hunter Biden. A longer trial might help a handful of moderate Republican senators who are eager to show independent voters that they are taking the allegations against Mr. Trump seriously. For those senators, a quick dismissal could be seen as a decision to condone the president\u2019s actions and sweep them under the rug without due consideration. Republican leaders have told Mr. Trump that they do not believe they could get the 51 votes required to quickly dismiss potential articles of impeachment. Mr. Trump himself is a wild card, according to several people familiar with his thinking about how to handle a trial that appears all but inevitable. At some moments, the president has told people close to him that he wants to see a lengthy trial in which his defenders are given the opportunity to call witnesses and deliver speeches on his behalf. But at other times, as he watches a torrent of negative news on cable television, he has said he wants a quick end to a process that he finds intolerable. On Thursday morning, he complained on Twitter about coverage of what he called the \u201cphony Impeachment Hoax,\u201d accusing the news media of failing to fairly report about the impeachment hearings. \u201cFAKE & CORRUPT NEWS!\u201d In a separate lunch meeting with a group of eight senators on Thursday, including some who have signaled an openness to the impeachment inquiry, Mr. Trump made brief comments about his frustration with the process, but did not ask for any commitments and did not discuss the procedures that a trial might follow, according to a statement from Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine. \u201cHe feels that whatever has come forward has been exactly what he says \u2014 useless,\u201d Senator Shelley Moore Capito, Republican of West Virginia, told reporters after returning from the lunch. Senator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, who has been one of the few members of the president\u2019s party to criticize Mr. Trump\u2019s conduct on Ukraine, attended the lunch but said Mr. Trump shook his hand and did not mention the comments about his conduct. The staff-level discussions with the senators on Thursday focused on the variety of ways that a Senate trial could play out and decisions that Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, will eventually have to make about the rules that will govern it. Those rules, which were last developed for the impeachment trial of former President Bill Clinton in early 1999, govern how the two sides present evidence, whether they can call witnesses, and what role senators would have as they serve as quasi-jurors on the Senate floor. The answers to those questions \u2014 which would have to be negotiated with Democratic senators \u2014 would affect how long a trial would last. In Mr. Clinton\u2019s case, senators agreed that Republicans could only call three witnesses to make their case against the president, making the trial much shorter than it might have been if they were allowed to present a longer case. In recent weeks, Mr. Trump \u2014 who frequently calls Republican lawmakers to comment on their television appearances \u2014 has begun reaching out to them by inviting small groups of senators to the White House for lunch. While the meetings have not been billed as pertaining to a certain topic, the impeachment inquiry has come up. Mr. Trump has also had Republican lawmakers review transcripts of both of his phone calls with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, before either call was released to the public for the first time. Mr. Trump has also weighed in with his impressions of the House proceedings, and discussed strategy during the lunches. \u201cThey\u2019re just waiting for the House thing to play out,\u201d said Senator Kevin Cramer, Republican of North Dakota, who attended a lunch last week.",

      "author": "Kenneth P. Vogel",
      "content": "    WASHINGTON \u2014 Federal prosecutors in Manhattan issued subpoenas in recent weeks to several players in President Trump\u2019s fund-raising apparatus as part of an investigation into two associates of Rudolph W. Giuliani who have been charged with violating campaign finance laws, according to people familiar with the investigation. The subpoenas went to a lobbying firm run by a top fund-raiser for Mr. Trump, Brian Ballard, and to two people who have helped raise money for America First Action, a super PAC created to support the president and allied candidates, the people said. Mr. Ballard and the America First fund-raisers worked to varying extents with Mr. Giuliani\u2019s associates Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, American citizens who helped Mr. Giuliani wage a pressure campaign on Ukraine that is now at the center of the impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump. The recent activity by prosecutors and F.B.I. agents shows that they have cast a wide net as they collect evidence about Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman, who were arrested last month. It also comes as the same prosecutors look into whether Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, violated a federal lobbying law in some of his dealings with Ukrainians. Mr. Giuliani and one of his companies were mentioned by name in one of the subpoenas, which was issued to a businessman who was approached by Mr. Parnas seeking an investment. He was trying to finance a portion of a $500,000 payment he had promised to Mr. Giuliani to consult for a company he helped found, Fraud Guarantee, according to a person familiar with the solicitation of the businessman. The businessman never provided the money. There is no indication that those who have received subpoenas or agreed to provide documents or interviews are suspected of wrongdoing. Prosecutors and F.B.I. agents have been seeking to speak with witnesses about how Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman gained entree into elite Republican finance circles that brought them into direct contact with Mr. Trump. Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman were charged with violations related to donations to various Republican politicians and groups, including a $325,000 contribution made to America First Action. They made the donation in the name of a company they had recently founded, Global Energy Producers. America First Action has voluntarily turned over documents to prosecutors in Manhattan, according to people familiar with the investigation. Prosecutors also arranged a voluntary interview in New York as soon as this week with Andrew Favorov, an executive with the Ukrainian state-owned gas company Naftogaz whom Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman tried to enlist in an effort to win business, potentially through Global Energy Producers. Mr. Favorov has Russian and United States citizenship, and permanent resident status in Ukraine. His interview, which was first reported by The Associated Press, suggests that prosecutors\u2019 interest in Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman extends beyond their political donations, and into their business efforts. The authorities arrested Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman on Oct. 9, sooner than previously planned, fearing they would leave the country without plans to return. Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman, who have pleaded not guilty, played major roles in the effort by Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani to pressure the Ukrainian government to commit to investigations that could be politically helpful to Mr. Trump, which was first reported by The New York Times. Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman helped connect Mr. Giuliani to Ukrainian prosecutors who claimed to have incriminating information about former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., a leading contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. The prosecutor also claimed to have damaging information about Ukrainians who sought to undermine Mr. Trump in 2016 and about Marie L. Yovanovitch, the United States ambassador to Kyiv and a target of Mr. Trump and his allies. Democrats contend that the efforts to force Ukraine to investigate those targets were an abuse of power. And witnesses in the impeachment hearings have suggested that Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman had financial motivations for pursuing the Ukrainian pressure campaign. In addition to the investigation by federal prosecutors for possible violations of a lobbying law, Mr. Giuliani has been subpoenaed by the House\u2019s impeachment investigators. He has denied wrongdoing and said that he has no current business interests in Ukraine. Mr. Giuliani, the former New York City mayor, has acknowledged accepting $500,000 for business and legal advice from Fraud Guarantee, and said that he represented Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman on a legal matter in Ukraine. The investigation into Mr. Giuliani grew out of the investigation into Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman. The charges against Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman are narrowly focused, and mostly unrelated to the Ukrainian pressure campaign. Mr. Parnas has indicated a willingness to work with congressional impeachment investigators, but it is unclear whether he will testify. Mr. Giuliani met Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman as they became involved in the Republican major-donor circuit, and the recent activity by prosecutors suggests that they are interested in learning more about how the men gained entree into that world. Mr. Parnas also developed a relationship through Republican donor politics with Mr. Ballard, whose firm, Ballard Partners, paid Mr. Parnas at least $22,500 for referring business from the Turkish government. The Turkish government agreed to pay Ballard Partners $1.5 million over a year in May 2017, and renewed its contract for $750,000 a year later, according to lobbying records. William W. Taylor III, a lawyer for Ballard Partners, confirmed that the business referred by Mr. Parnas was with the Turkish government. Mr. Taylor said in a statement: \u201cBallard Partners is cooperating with a United States attorney\u2019s office for the Southern District of New York investigation. It has received a subpoena and is complying.\u201d Kelly Sadler, a spokeswoman for America First Action, said in a statement that the group contacted the Southern District of New York last month \u201cand offered to voluntarily cooperate.\u201d \u201cWe have not been issued any subpoenas,\u201d she added. \u201cAmerica First Action strictly follows the law and, as this is an open matter, we have no further comment.\u201d Joseph A. Bondy, a lawyer for Mr. Parnas, said he and his client were \u201cpleased to know that the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in the Southern District of New York is continuing its investigation, and look forward to its witnesses providing complete and accurate information in response to their questions.\u201d A spokesman for Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States attorney in Manhattan, declined to comment.",

      "author": "Jack Nicas",
      "content": " President Trump on Wednesday toured a Texas plant that makes high-end Apple computers, chatting with Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, and accepting a plate with the words \u201cAssembled in USA.\u201d It was a pretty typical publicity event, until the end. Mr. Trump walked in front of the news cameras and took credit for the plant, suggesting it had opened that day. \u201cFor me, this is a very special day,\u201d he said. Mr. Cook stood next to him, stone-faced. The plant has been making Apple computers since 2013. Immediately after Mr. Trump\u2019s comments, Mr. Cook thanked the president and his staff. \u201cI\u2019m grateful for their support in pulling today off and getting us to this far. It would not be possible without them,\u201d he said. He did not correct the record. The moment was part of a bizarre afternoon in Texas, where the president played up a six-year-old factory as evidence of his three-year-old presidency\u2019s success in bringing manufacturing jobs back to the United States. It showed Mr. Trump\u2019s willingness to leverage his influence over American companies in his pitch to voters that he deserves another four years in the White House. And it illustrated the complicated position that Mr. Cook and other corporate executives find themselves in with this president, forced to stand silently by while he sometimes misleads about their businesses. After Mr. Trump departed the factory, he tweeted, \u201cToday I opened a major Apple Manufacturing plant in Texas that will bring high paying jobs back to America.\u201d Apple officials didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. The plant Mr. Trump toured is owned by Flex, a company that has made Apple\u2019s top-of-the-line Mac Pro computers there since 2013. When Apple decided to make the Mac Pro in the United States in 2012, Mr. Cook went on prime-time television to announce it. Apple had previously assembled virtually all of its products in China. Yet when production of the computer began in Texas, it quickly ran into problems, in part because of a lack of nearby suppliers. Earlier this year, Apple unveiled a new version of the Mac Pro, with a starting price of $6,000. Shortly after, Apple and the White House began a monthslong public dance over where the computer would be made. Apple said it needed waivers from tariffs the White House had imposed on certain Chinese-made components, like power cables and circuit boards, to keep making the Mac Pro in Texas. At first, Mr. Trump tweeted no, but the White House later granted 10 of the waivers. On Wednesday, Mr. Cook showed Mr. Trump the new Mac Pro, which recently began coming off the plant\u2019s assembly lines. He pointed to different components in the computer and ticked off which states they came from. Apple uses 9,000 suppliers across all 50 states for its products, it said. Nearly all of those suppliers ship their parts to China, where Apple\u2019s manufacturing partners assemble the vast majority of the company\u2019s devices, including iPhones, iPads, MacBooks and the Apple Watch. Those Chinese factories employ millions of people. Flex\u2019s plant in Austin employs about 500 workers, who assemble one of Apple\u2019s lowest-volume products. After Mr. Trump\u2019s comments on Wednesday, Mr. Cook used the moment to pitch Apple\u2019s new Mac Pro computer. \u201cIt can perform 56 trillion tasks per second,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an example of American design, American manufacturing and American ingenuity.\u201d He then noted that before Mr. Trump had arrived that day, Apple had broken ground on a nearby, previously announced $1 billion campus in Austin. Those offices are expected to open in 2022 with about 5,000 white-collar employees in areas like engineering, sales, operations and customer support. The campus could eventually house 15,000 workers, but none are expected to be in manufacturing. Mr. Cook has become one of Mr. Trump\u2019s top allies in corporate America, despite their differing styles and disagreement on certain issues. Mr. Cook has openly criticized Mr. Trump\u2019s policies on the environment and immigration, but he has put those concerns aside to lobby Mr. Trump on issues like tax and trade. Under the Trump administration\u2019s tax cuts, Apple last year brought back the vast majority of the $252 billion in cash it had held abroad, saving it billions of dollars in taxes. It has since returned much of that money to shareholders. The trade war between the United States and China acutely threatens Apple\u2019s business. Apple is already paying tariffs on some products, and it is set to pay more if the next round of tariffs go into effect next month. Apple has been asking for waivers from those tariffs. When asked on Wednesday whether Apple will get those waivers, Mr. Trump replied, \u201cWe\u2019ll look into that.\u201d On Wednesday, Mr. Trump called Mr. Cook a \u201cvery special person\u201d because of his ability to create jobs.

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Gordon D. Sondland had not even finished his testimony on Wednesday before it was being called the \u201cJohn Dean moment\u201d of the President Trump impeachment drama. With the presidency on the line, a once-trusted lieutenant pointed the finger at Mr. Trump in a proceeding that could lead to Watergate-style charges of high crimes and misdemeanors. For the first time, Mr. Trump\u2019s critics got the sort of viral moments they have craved, crisp accusatory cancer-on-the-presidency lines uttered on camera that can now be played over and over again on social media and cable television, making clear just who was in charge of the campaign to pressure a foreign power to help bring down the president\u2019s domestic political rivals. \u201cWe followed the president\u2019s orders.\u201d \u201cThe president directed us to do so.\u201d \u201cAt the express direction of the president of the United States.\u201d Even John Dean thought it was a bit of a John Dean moment for Mr. Sondland, the million-dollar Trump donor turned ambassador to the European Union. \u201cHe decided to put the truth over party and president, because the president really can\u2019t be pleased with it,\u201d Mr. Dean said in an interview after the hearing. \u201cIt\u2019s going to change the dynamics of the proceedings.\u201d The testimony before the House Intelligence Committee energized Democrats who called it their smoking gun and seemed to take back Republicans, who struggled at first to undercut his account. Mr. Sondland made a point of stressing that he was no rogue operator, but in fact at key moments had kept everyone \u201cin the loop,\u201d including the vice president, secretary of state, acting White House chief of staff and national security adviser. But Mr. Sondland was more of a flawed witness than Mr. Dean, who was the former White House counsel when he testified against President Richard M. Nixon in 1973. While Mr. Dean described many meetings about the Watergate cover-up with Mr. Nixon, Mr. Sondland could only recall the details of one conversation in which Mr. Trump made his wishes clear and even then the words uttered by the president were somewhat elliptical. Mr. Sondland recounted an Oval Office meeting on May 23 when Mr. Trump told him and other advisers who aspired to improve relations with Ukraine to \u201ctalk with Rudy,\u201d passing them off to Rudolph W. Giuliani, his personal lawyer who was busy trying to extract damaging information about Democrats from the former Soviet republic. What the president meant was clear, Mr. Sondland said: They had to help Mr. Giuliani press Ukraine for political help. Mr. Giuliani was the president\u2019s proxy. Republicans on the committee eventually rallied to press Mr. Sondland about his direct communications with Mr. Trump. Under questioning, Mr. Sondland acknowledged that the president never explicitly told him that $391 million in suspended security aid was tied to Ukraine publicly committing to investigate Democrats; that was a connection he \u201cpresumed.\u201d Likewise, Republicans prompted Mr. Sondland to recall a Sept. 9 telephone conversation when he asked the president what he wanted from Ukraine and Mr. Trump responded: \u201cI want nothing. I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo.\u201d Democrats pointed out that the phone conversation came after the White House had been notified about a whistle-blower complaint, meaning the president had reason to deny any quid pro quo whether it was true or not. Nonetheless, it was a useful line for  Republicans that they quickly turned into their own viral moment played over and over on television and social media. The president then stepped out onto the White House lawn with notes in large, thick block letters on Air Force One stationery to remember the points he wanted to make to reporters as he headed to a waiting helicopter: \u201cI WANT NOTHING. I WANT NOTHING. I WANT NO QUID PRO QUO.\u201d Still, Mr. Sondland thought he did and he was the witness Democrats had hoped he would be. In their quest to impeach Mr. Trump, Democrats have been looking for a John Dean figure all year without success. Michael D. Cohen, the president\u2019s personal lawyer who turned on him before heading to prison on charges stemming from a hush money scheme, was too damaged. Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel in the Russia investigation, would not play along. Mr. Sondland seemed perfectly happy to play the role. \u201cSondland was supposed to be Trump\u2019s guy, the one Trump had repeatedly pointed to in the past to exonerate him,\u201d said Neal K. Katyal, a former acting solicitor general under President Barack Obama who will publish a book next week advocating Mr. Trump\u2019s impeachment. \u201cYet today, Sondland testified that there was a quid pro quo. Indeed, a whole section of his testimony was devoted to it.\u201d John Q. Barrett, a former associate independent counsel who investigated the Iran-contra scandal, said Mr. Sondland\u2019s conclusion that there was in fact a quid pro quo \u201cwas powerful and shocking testimony \u2014 yes, very reminiscent of John Dean\u2019s testimony.\u201d That gave renewed energy to Democrats, who predicted a burst of momentum that may make it harder for Senate Republicans to look away if it gets to a trial. \u201cBiggest day ever,\u201d said Rahm Emanuel, a former congressman, mayor of Chicago and senior aide to President Bill Clinton and Mr. Obama. \u201cIt changes everything. There is no line of defense left.\u201d Republicans dismissed that as partisan wishful thinking. In the end, they argued, Mr. Sondland was at least as damaging to the Democrats\u2019 case as he was helpful to it. Other officials like Vice President Mike Pence and Energy Secretary Rick Perry rushed out statements through aides disputing portions of his testimony. \u201cThey have yet to point to a shred of evidence when it comes to impeachable offenses,\u201d Representative Elise Stefanik, Republican of New York, told reporters outside the hearing room. Asked the most important piece of exculpatory evidence that lawmakers had heard, she said, \u201cthe president\u2019s own words.\u201d In some ways, Mr. Sondland\u2019s testimony reoriented the debate. He noted that when it came to  a quid pro quo, there were two separate questions \u2014 whether a White House meeting coveted by President Voldymyr Zelensky of Ukraine was conditioned on his willingness to announce that he would investigate Democrats and whether the security aid was. Mr. Sondland confirmed text messages released weeks ago that made clear that a White House visit was certainly contingent on the investigations. No linkage with the security aid has  been definitively outlined in documents released so far and other officials  have testified that they did not know if the two matters were directly connected, although some thought so. Mr. Sondland said he originally did not think they were but could come up with no other explanation for the aid freeze. He also put his finger on a distinction often overlooked: For the president, it seemed more important that Ukrainian officials announce that they were investigating Democrats than for them to actually follow through on doing it. \u201cI never heard, Mr. Goldman, anyone say that the investigations had to start or had to be completed,\u201d Mr. Sondland told Daniel S. Goldman, the top Democratic counsel who questioned him. \u201cThe only thing I heard from Mr. Giuliani or otherwise was that they had to be announced in some form.\u201d Jill Wine-Banks, a Watergate prosecutor, said Mr. Sondland reminded her less of Mr. Dean than Jeb Magruder, a top Nixon campaign official who was convicted of perjury and spent seven months in prison. \u201cJeb was always sort of weaseling out of full admissions,\u201d said Ms. Wines-Banks, who worked on Mr. Magruder\u2019s case. \u201cJohn, when he came clean, he really came clean.\u201d Mr. Dean created a sensation when he told a Senate committee in June 1973 that Mr. Nixon was directly involved in the Watergate cover-up, one of the most important moments leading to the president\u2019s eventual resignation in August 1974 rather than face impeachment by the House and a trial in the Senate. Mr. Dean pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice and served four months in a former Army base. Mr. Dean, who spent much of Wednesday watching Mr. Sondland from a CNN studio, said afterward that there was indeed a limit to the comparison. Mr. Sondland implicated his president and many other top officials too, but still said he could not remember many specific moments, perhaps resisting the fullest possible account. \u201cI\u2019d call it a modified limited hangout,\u201d Mr. Dean said, recalling a phrase made famous during Watergate, \u201cwhich means he protected himself, nailed a few other people and gave limited insights into what\u2019s really going on.\u201d",

      "author": "Charlie Savage",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi this week explicitly accused President Trump of \u201cbribery,\u201d suggesting after hearings in the impeachment investigation opened that he is guilty of one of the few specific offenses listed in the Constitution as a basis for impeaching and removing a president. \u201cThe devastating testimony corroborated evidence of bribery uncovered in the inquiry, and that the president abused his power and violated his oath by threatening to withhold military aid and a White House meeting in exchange for an investigation into his political rival \u2014 a clear attempt by the president to give himself an advantage in the 2020 election,\u201d Ms. Pelosi told reporters at her weekly news conference in the Capitol. Here is a closer look at the concept of bribery and how the emerging evidence about Mr. Trump may line up with it. Federal and state laws offer various definitions of bribery aimed at criminalizing acts that corrupt the integrity of government by intermingling official actions with private payments or personal favors. For example, Section 201 of Chapter 18 of the United States Code, defines bribery as the gift, offer, promise or solicitation of a thing of value in order to influence a public official to perform or omit an official act. For impeachment purposes, however, the concept of bribery is not necessarily limited to those narrow terms. After all, Congress had not yet enacted the federal bribery statute in 1787, when the Founders wrote into the Constitution that a president could be impeached for \u201ctreason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.\u201d Congress can remove a president for any action that a simple House majority and a two-thirds majority of the Senate vote on \u2014 even if it violated no ordinary criminal statute. The Constitution invokes the concept of \u201cbribery\u201d without explaining what the term encompasses. Scholars say that silence is likely because the meaning of the term was well understood from English common law and parliamentary practice. The Founders intended for the concept of bribery, for impeachment purposes, to broadly cover any \u201ccorrupt abuse of power to obtain personal benefit,\u201d three lawyers for the nonprofit group Protect Democracy wrote on the website Lawfare. They recently compiled a survey of early American and English writings and precedents about bribery, as well as discussion in more contemporary scholarly works on impeachment. At the heart of the issue is what motivated Mr. Trump and his proxies to pressure President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to not just open, but publicly announce, investigations that could benefit Mr. Trump politically. Ms. Pelosi mentioned inquiries that Mr. Trump sought into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son. Is it more likely that Mr. Trump was earnestly concerned about protecting American interests by pressing for the investigations? Or was he instead looking for personal gain and, in the case of the Bidens, cynically seeking to engineer a basis to be able to call his political rival \u201ccorrupt\u201d on the 2020 campaign trail? If the latter, one way of thinking about the matter is that Mr. Trump solicited a bribe: He was seeking a personal favor from Mr. Zelensky that would benefit him as a condition for performing two official acts \u2014 scheduling a White House visit that Mr. Zelensky coveted and releasing military aid that Congress had appropriated. Primarily for political messaging. Critics of Mr. Trump have generally been talking about the scandal in terms of more abstract concepts like \u201cabuse of power\u201d and the Latin phrase \u201cquid pro quo,\u201d which means exchanging one thing for another. Those phrases can be difficult to understand and raise the question of whether they amount to an impeachable offense. Ms. Pelosi\u2019s sharpened rhetoric was part of a shift in which Democrats and other critics of Mr. Trump have sought to talk about their allegations using a more plain-English term \u2014 and one that is explicitly impeachable. Some analysts have cited extortion as another framework for thinking about Mr. Trump\u2019s pressure campaign on Ukraine. One version of this offense is when a public official unlawfully obtains something of value, like an illegal fee, from another person by threatening to take or withhold some official action in a way that would harm the victim. Last month, when Mick Mulvaney, Mr. Trump\u2019s acting chief of staff, gave a news conference in which he appeared to admit that the arrangement was a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d \u2014 which he later walked back \u2014 he also told reporters to \u201cget over it\u201d because it is routine for the United States government to hold up foreign aid to get a recipient country to change some policy. As a description of using foreign aid as a lever in foreign policy, Mr. Mulvaney was correct. But the question boils down to whether Mr. Trump was seeking to coerce Ukrainian officials into actions to benefit the United States or to benefit himself. Not legally. Mr. Trump\u2019s defenders have repeatedly argued that Mr. Trump committed no impeachable offense because he ultimately released the military aid to Ukraine in September, even though Mr. Zelensky had not announced any investigations. Critics note that Mr. Trump released aid to Ukraine only after the White House learned that a whistle-blower had filed a complaint attempting to tell lawmakers that Mr. Trump was using his official powers to coerce Ukraine into helping his re-election campaign, and amid increasing and bipartisan pressure from Congress for the security assistance to be released. In any case, while the impeachment process is not a court of criminal law, if it were, arguing that the scheme failed would be no defense: The federal statute specifically designates even an attempt to solicit a bribe as a crime. Jonathan Chait of New York magazine has colorfully labeled this the \u201cSideshow Bob\u201d defense, after a character in \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d whose plot to kill Bart Simpson was foiled. In a 1994 episode, the imprisoned Sideshow Bob denounced his conviction for attempted murder: \u201cConvicted of a crime I didn\u2019t even commit. Hah! Attempted murder? Now honestly, what is that? Do they give a Nobel Prize for attempted chemistry? Do they?\u201d",

      "content": " Follow our live coverage of David Holmes and Fiona Hill testifying in the impeachment hearings. WASHINGTON \u2014 Fiona Hill knew she was taking a risk in going to work for President Trump. A British-born coal-miner\u2019s daughter with a Ph.D. from Harvard, Dr. Hill is a respected Russia expert, former intelligence analyst and co-author of a 500-page book analyzing the psyche of its president, Vladimir V. Putin. So the prospect of working for a president who speaks admiringly of Mr. Putin and has expressed doubts that Russia interfered in the 2016 election gave her pause. Her decision to join the National Security Council in April 2017 \u2014 and to stay for more than two years after Mr. Trump cozied up to Mr. Putin and publicly disparaged the nation\u2019s intelligence agencies \u2014 strained friendships and made her a target of right-wing conspiracy theorists who spread rumors that she was a Democratic mole. Now, it has landed her near the center of the impeachment inquiry into whether Mr. Trump abused his power to enlist a foreign leader to help him in the 2020 presidential election. Her planned appearance before the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday represents the fulfillment of Dr. Hill\u2019s worst fears about what could happen if she swallowed her reservations and went to work for Mr. Trump. \u201cThe risk was what we see playing out in front of us \u2014 that something wrong would happen, that she would do the right thing and other people wouldn\u2019t, and there would be a reckoning,\u201d said Tom Wright, a former colleague and friend of Dr. Hill\u2019s. \u201cAnd afterward there could be hearings \u2014 with, at worst case, the fate of the presidency riding on it.\u201d On Thursday, Dr. Hill will take her turn as the latest in a series of witnesses to testify publicly before Congress. Many have been nonpartisan diplomats and national security experts who went to work for the president thinking they might be the proverbial \u201cadults in the room\u201d checking Mr. Trump\u2019s impulses, only to find themselves caught up in a mess of his making, and in danger of being attacked. [Here\u2019s background on David Holmes, another witness testifying on Thursday.] In closed-door testimony, Dr. Hill called her gripping account \u201cmy worst nightmare.\u201d In it, she revealed how she and her boss at the time, John R. Bolton, the former White House national security adviser, were alarmed at a rogue effort by allies of Mr. Trump, led by his personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, to deliver on the president\u2019s desire for Ukraine to announce investigations into his political rivals. In testimony on Wednesday, one of those allies \u2014 Gordon D. Sondland, a Trump megadonor turned ambassador to the European Union \u2014 turned on the president and top administration officials. He told lawmakers that he was only doing Mr. Trump\u2019s bidding in pressing Ukraine for the investigations, and that Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Mick Mulvaney, the acting chief of staff, were among those well aware of it. In Mr. Sondland\u2019s telling during a private interview with impeachment investigators last month, Dr. Hill was furious to the point of shaking when he stopped by her office to say goodbye to her before she left the White House, about a week before the now-infamous July 25 telephone call in which Mr. Trump pressed President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son Hunter. (Dr. Hill had argued against the call, saying she did not understand its purpose.) \u201cShe was pretty upset about her role in the administration, about her superiors, about the president,\u201d Mr. Sondland recalled in a closed-door deposition. \u201cShe was sort of shaking. She was pretty mad.\u201d A lawyer for Dr. Hill, Lee Wolosky, has disputed that characterization, writing on Twitter that Mr. Sondland \u201cfabricated communications with Dr. Hill.\u201d Dr. Hill is neither pro-Trump nor a \u201cNever Trumper,\u201d and she was always circumspect in talking about Mr. Trump, friends said. She refused speaking invitations of the sort that would be routine for top advisers in past administrations \u2014 even at the Brookings Institution, where she was on leave as director of the Center on the United States and Europe. But her own closed-door testimony reveals how fraught her time in the administration was. In it, she described a tense White House meeting with Mr. Sondland, Mr. Bolton, Energy Secretary Rick Perry and Ukrainian officials in which it became apparent that Mr. Mulvaney was working with Mr. Sondland and Mr. Giuliani to execute the president\u2019s plan. Dr. Hill described her horror that the Ukrainians \u2014 foreign nationals \u2014 were hanging around the West Wing, outside the Situation Room, one of the most secure and sensitive spots in the White House. When Mr. Sondland moved the meeting down to a room in the White House basement, Mr. Bolton instructed her to follow them to find out what was going on. She did so, and confronted Mr. Sondland, cutting him off when he dangled the prospect of a White House meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky. \u201cIt has to go through proper procedure,\u201d Dr. Hill insisted. Then she reported back to Mr. Bolton, who told her to report it to the National Security Council\u2019s top lawyer, John A. Eisenberg. \u201cYou go and tell Eisenberg that I am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up on this,\u201d she recalled Mr. Bolton saying. Friends said that sounded like the Dr. Hill they know: straight, to the point, unafraid to push back. \u201cFiona has served impeccably in the executive branch,\u201d said Strobe Talbott, the former president of the Brookings Institution, \u201cand, now, she\u2019s helping Congress understand the disaster Trump has visited on the country and the world.\u201d Republicans view her as suspect because she worked with Christopher Steele, who later wrote an infamous dossier on Mr. Trump\u2019s ties to Russia, when she was an intelligence officer and he was her British counterpart. And her time as an unpaid adviser to the Central Eurasia Project of the Open Society Foundation, founded by the Democratic philanthropist George Soros, fueled rumors spread by the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. \u201cMy entire first year of my tenure at the National Security Council was filled with hateful calls, conspiracy theories, which has started again,\u201d she told House investigators, saying her attackers accused her \u201cof being a Soros mole in the White House, of colluding with all kinds of enemies of the president.\u201d Dr. Hill, 54, had an unusual path to academia. The daughter of a coal miner and a midwife, she had a hardscrabble childhood in northeast England \u2014 a childhood that bred toughness, her friends say. Once, when she was 11, a boy in her class set one of her pigtails on fire while she was taking a test. She put the fire out with her hands, and finished the test. She learned to speak Russian and eventually made her way across the Atlantic to Harvard for a fellowship, where she studied under the scholar Richard Pipes, known for his hard-line views about what was then the Soviet Union. Dr. Hill\u2019s own views are more nuanced, friends and colleagues say; she is not so much a Russia hawk as a cleareyed realist. She was also very clear about the threat Russia posed to Ukraine. \u201cShe comes from this realist tradition where you start with the proposition that this other actor is capable of killing me,\u201d said Graham Allison, a Harvard political scientist who worked with Dr. Hill on an initiative to teach foreign governments about democracy. \u201cI can\u2019t figure out how to kill them without committing suicide, so now I have to find a way to live with them.\u201d In 2006, Dr. Hill joined the National Intelligence Council as national intelligence officer for Russia and Eurasia, a job that required her to assess the Russian threat. In 2009, she rejoined Brookings, where she had previously been a fellow. In 2013, she and Clifford Gaddy published \u201cMr. Putin: Operative in the Kremlin.\u201d \u201cShe confirmed what I thought, which is what I\u2019ve said very publicly for a long time: He\u2019s the most dangerous guy on Earth,\u201d said Adm. Mike Mullen, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who got to know Dr. Hill when she was an intelligence analyst. Yet for all of her scholarly work, it was an appearance on television that landed Dr. Hill her White House job. After Mr. Trump was elected, K.T. McFarland, a Fox News commentator, recommended her to Gen. Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump\u2019s first national security adviser. General Flynn, whose tenure ended in scandal after 24 days, offered her the job as the National Security Council\u2019s senior director for Europe and Russia, though she came on after he left. Some friends warned her against it. Among them was Marvin Kalb, a senior fellow at Brookings, who thought Dr. Hill might have trouble in part because she was an immigrant. \u201cI was concerned that she might run into problems that others might not run into, and I thought that her judgment of Putin might not sit well with the president,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cMy recommendation to her was to stay away. But she believed very strongly in the opportunity to serve.\u201d She got off to an uncertain start; Mr. Trump once mistook her for a low-level member of support staff. And if there was any doubt that the president had little interest in national security protocol and would rely on no one but himself, it was erased when he took notes away from his interpreter during a private meeting with Mr. Putin in Hamburg, Germany, in 2017. Then came the disastrous Helsinki, Finland, summit in 2018, where Mr. Trump accepted the Russian president\u2019s denial that his country had interfered in the 2016 race. In a stunning break with protocol, he also told Mr. Putin that he might let Russia interrogate a former American ambassador, Michael A. McFaul, a staunch critic of Russia\u2019s record on human rights. Mr. McFaul visited her at the White House to complain. \u201cI thought they were going to clean it up when they got back to Washington, and they didn\u2019t,\u201d Mr. McFaul said. \u201cThey just doubled down.\u201d Some colleagues of Dr. Hill\u2019s wondered why she did not quit then. Others, like Angela Stent, a Russia expert at Georgetown University and mentor to Dr. Hill, said she contemplated leaving at times, but stayed because she wanted \u201cto minimize the damage of some things that were happening with Russia.\u201d When she left the White House in July, it was as planned; she wanted to spend more time with her husband and 12-year-old daughter and her mother, who is ill. If she had been frustrated there, Mr. Wright said, she kept it to herself. \u201cThis exit was not what she had planned,\u201d Mr. Wright said. \u201cI don\u2019t think she was thinking, \u2018I\u2019m going to go out in a blaze of glory, take a moral stand and testify.\u2019 That was definitely not her intention. She just wanted to do her job with no fuss or drama.\u201d",

Sondland, the diplomat at the center of the House impeachment inquiry, kept Secretary of State Mike Pompeo apprised of key developments in the campaign to pressure Ukraine\u2019s leader into public commitments that would satisfy President Trump, two people briefed on the matter said. Mr. Sondland informed Mr. Pompeo in mid-August about a draft statement that Mr. Sondland and another American diplomat had worked on with the Ukrainians that they hoped would persuade Mr. Trump to grant Ukraine\u2019s new president the Oval Office meeting he was seeking, the people said. Later that month, Mr. Sondland discussed with Mr. Pompeo the possibility of pushing the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to pledge during a planned meeting with Mr. Trump in Warsaw that he would take the steps being sought by Mr. Trump as a way to break the logjam in relations between the two countries, the people said. Mr. Pompeo expressed his approval of the plan, they said, but Mr. Trump later canceled his trip to Poland. The disclosures link Mr. Pompeo more directly to the Trump administration\u2019s pressure campaign on Ukraine. It is not clear how specific Mr. Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union, was in his communications with Mr. Pompeo about what was being asked of the Ukrainians. But Mr. Pompeo was among those who had listened in on a call between the two leaders on July 25, when Mr. Trump explicitly asked Mr. Zelensky for investigations into former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and into a debunked conspiracy theory about Ukrainian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign. A lawyer for Mr. Pompeo declined to comment. Mr. Sondland is scheduled to testify on Wednesday in the impeachment proceedings against Mr. Trump, and he is expected to face tough questioning about gaps and misleading statements in the deposition he provided the committee last month. Mr. Sondland is sure to be grilled in particular about his failure to tell the committee about a phone call on July 26 with the president in which Mr. Trump, according to another American diplomat who overheard the call, asked Mr. Sondland if Mr. Zelensky had agreed to the investigation of Mr. Biden. Mr. Sondland later told the diplomat, David Holmes, that when it came to Ukraine, Mr. Trump was only interested in \u201cbig stuff\u201d that would benefit him, like the \u201cBiden investigation\u201d that his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani was pushing for. Mr. Sondland\u2019s exchanges with Mr. Pompeo suggest that he could use his testimony to counter the testimonies of other administration officials, who have said that Mr. Sondland was part of a team operating outside of normal foreign policy and national security channels that sought to do the bidding of Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani. In August, Mr. Sondland and the special envoy to Ukraine, Kurt D. Volker, were in negotiations with a top Ukrainian official, Andriy Yermak, about a public statement making a commitment to investigating Mr. Biden and the energy company Burisma, which had placed Mr. Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden on its board. Mr. Giuliani had been pressing for that commitment and for Mr. Trump\u2019s request that Mr. Zelensky\u2019s government look into whether Ukrainians, not Russians, were behind the hacking of the Democratic National Committee in 2016. Mr. Sondland and Mr. Volker have testified that they sought to get the Ukrainians to release the statement in order to satisfy Mr. Giuliani and, by extension, Mr. Trump, and to reset relations between the two countries. The Ukrainians never did it. Mr. Pompeo has said little publicly about what he knew about the pressure campaign on Ukraine, but he has publicly criticized the Democrats\u2019 impeachment investigation, claiming that it has been unfair to Mr. Trump and the State Department. The secretary of state had acceded to Mr. Trump\u2019s order in the spring that he recall the United States ambassador to Ukraine, Marie L. Yovanovitch, who had been the target of a campaign of criticism involving Mr. Giuliani and two of his associates. While Mr. Pompeo heard Mr. Trump make his demands for the investigations into the Bidens and the 2016 election on the July 25 call with Mr. Zelensky, it is not clear what he knew, or when, about the freeze over the summer of $391 million in United States military aid to Ukraine. After a meeting on Sept. 1 between Mr. Pence and Mr. Zelensky in Warsaw, Mr. Sondland told Mr. Yermak that the resumption of the aid was tied to an agreement by Ukraine to make a commitment to the investigations sought by Mr. Trump, according to testimony made to the House impeachment inquiry. Mr. Sondland is one of the few witnesses who spoke directly with Mr. Trump about Ukraine, making his testimony especially important for Democrats. Republicans are expected to try to undercut his credibility by laying out an array of discrepancies in it. Mr. Sondland initially told the committee that he believed there was no link between the investigations Mr. Trump wanted and the release of the military aid. But two weeks after he was deposed, Mr. Sondland amended his testimony, and said the reverse. After he did that, new witnesses came forward to describe events Mr. Sondland had not told the committee about. Among them was Mr. Holmes, a State Department staff member in Kyiv, Ukraine\u2019s capital, who said in his deposition to the House Intelligence Committee that he overheard the call Mr. Sondland had with Mr. Trump in July after Mr. Sondland met with Mr. Zelensky. \u201cPresident Zelensky \u2018loves your ass,\u2019\u201d Mr. Holmes said he heard Mr. Sondland tell Mr. Trump. \u201cI then heard President Trump ask, \u2018He\u2019s going to do the investigation?\u2019\u201d Mr. Holmes said. \u201c\u2018He\u2019s going to do it,\u2019\u201d Mr. Holmes said Mr. Sondland responded.",

Sanger and Edward WongPRINT EDITIONA Witness Places Pompeo Firmly \u2018in the Loop\u2019|November 21, 2019, Page A1",
      "author": "David E. Sanger",
      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has for months deflected questions about whether the Trump administration demanded political favors from Ukraine in exchange for military aid. He has refused to explain why he recalled the American ambassador, declared that it was \u201cinappropriate\u201d for his diplomats to testify before Congress and declined to hand over documents to impeachment investigators. On Wednesday, Gordon D. Sondland, the American ambassador to the European Union, filled in the blanks: He said Mr. Pompeo and his top aides \u201cknew what we were doing, and why,\u201d and recited emails he wrote to Mr. Pompeo about the quid pro quo demanded by President Trump. \u201cEveryone was in the loop,\u201d Mr. Sondland said. Mr. Sondland\u2019s testimony has undercut any notion that Mr. Pompeo, the administration\u2019s most powerful national security official, was not a participant in Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure Ukraine. It also firmly places him at the center of one of the nation\u2019s biggest foreign policy controversies in nearly two decades, since the debate over the intelligence that led to the war in Iraq. Whatever Mr. Pompeo\u2019s future plans, Mr. Trump\u2019s secretary of state is now tied intimately to the Ukraine controversy. Even before Mr. Sondland\u2019s testimony, Mr. Pompeo was rumored to be seeking an exit from the State Department, perhaps to run for a Senate seat in Kansas, his adopted home state, with an eye toward a presidential bid once Mr. Trump leaves the stage. No matter what he does, Mr. Pompeo will almost certainly face charges that, at best, he abetted Mr. Trump in enlisting a foreign nation to help his 2020 campaign as the price for aid in a grinding war involving Russia in eastern Ukraine. At worst, Mr. Pompeo will be seen as coordinating and approving the demands that Ukraine\u2019s new president, Volodymyr Zelensky, announce investigations into dubious claims about the Biden family and 2016 election interference as the price for an Oval Office meeting and a resumption of American military aid. Speaking before the House Intelligence Committee on Wednesday, Mr. Sondland said that the State Department had not given him access to his own emails and telephone logs to prepare for his testimony, which would have allowed him to refresh his memory. Mr. Pompeo was criticized by the chairman of the House panel, Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California, in the opening moments of the hearing. Mr. Pompeo, he said, was engaged in a Watergate-style \u201cobstruction of this investigation.\u201d \u201cWe have not received a single document from the State Department, and as Ambassador Sondland\u2019s opening statement today will make clear, those documents bear directly on this investigation and this impeachment inquiry,\u201d Mr. Schiff said. He added: \u201cThe knowledge of this scheme was far and wide. And included, among others, Secretary of State Pompeo.\u201d Mr. Schiff then issued a direct warning to Mr. Trump and Mr. Pompeo: \u201cI will just say this, they do so at their own peril. I remind the president that Article 3 of the impeachment articles drafted against President Nixon was his refusal to obey the subpoenas of Congress.\u201d Mr. Pompeo admitted last month that he took part in the July 25 call between Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky, but has refused to talk in detail about his involvement in the matter. Yet several of his top diplomats have gone to Congress to pull back the curtains on Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts, infuriating the president. State Department employees privately have cheered on those diplomats while criticizing Mr. Pompeo for what they call a failure of leadership. Mr. Sondland noted that Mr. Pompeo and several of the secretary\u2019s top aides received his emails about Ukraine. \u201cOn Aug. 22, I emailed Secretary Pompeo, directly copying Secretariat Kenna,\u201d he said of one instance, referring to Lisa Kenna, the executive secretary. He also said Ms. Kenna would sometimes print out his emails on Ukraine addressed to Mr. Pompeo and \u201cput them in front of him.\u201d Mr. Pompeo has told associates that he believes the impeachment testimonies are partly aimed at forcing him to play a Washington game that would end with him turning on the president to save his own career. And he refuses to participate, Mr. Pompeo has said. On Wednesday, Mr. Sondland painted a picture of an activist secretary of state who was informed of attempts to force Mr. Zelensky to announce opening the investigations. Replying to the Aug. 22 email from Mr. Sondland, Mr. Pompeo even approved a plan to have Mr. Zelensky tell Mr. Trump at a scheduled meeting in Warsaw that Mr. Zelensky would pledge to move forward \u201con those issues of importance\u201d to the president, Mr. Sondland said. \u201cWe kept the leadership of the State Department and the N.S.C. informed of our activities,\u201d Mr. Sondland said, referring to Mr. Pompeo and John R. Bolton, the national security adviser at the time who oversaw the National Security Council staff. \u201cThey knew what we were doing and why.\u201d He added, \u201cState Department was fully supportive of our engagement in Ukraine efforts, and was aware that a commitment to investigations was among the issues we were pursuing.\u201d Mr. Pompeo appears to have kept his Ukraine and Russia policy staff in the dark on those efforts. In effect, that means diplomats outside the executive offices were trying to carry out the traditional American policy to support Ukraine against Russia \u2014 and get the military aid flowing \u2014 while Mr. Pompeo was involved in Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts. After helping Mr. Trump and Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, remove Marie L. Yovanovitch as ambassador of Ukraine \u2014 she championed anticorruption measures \u2014 Mr. Pompeo failed to inform the veteran diplomat he picked to succeed her, William B. Taylor Jr., of the political demands being made of Mr. Zelensky. In testimony, Mr. Taylor described slowly uncovering the plan, and sending Mr. Pompeo a cable on Aug. 29 saying that withholding the aid was \u201cfolly.\u201d Even then, Mr. Taylor did not appear to know of Mr. Pompeo\u2019s role. \u201cThe Ukraine scandal is a great microcosm of how this administration\u2019s real foreign policy machinery operates,\u201d said Andrew S. Weiss, a former senior official at the National Security Council, State Department and Pentagon who advised on Russia and Ukraine. \u201cOur allies and adversaries all know about this. Yet it\u2019s just so dysfunctional to have people like Marie Yovanovitch and Bill Taylor spinning their wheels out in Kyiv while Pompeo and Giuliani indulged the president\u2019s affection for baseless conspiracy theories and hand-to-hand political combat.\u201d In Brussels on Wednesday, Mr. Pompeo said he had not seen Mr. Sondland\u2019s testimony. Under questioning by reporters, he also said he would not recuse himself from any decisions by the State Department to release documents related to the impeachment inquiry. Mr. Pompeo repeated a broad answer he has given on questions about Ukraine. \u201cI know precisely what American policy was with respect to Ukraine,\u201d he said. \u201cI was working on it, and I\u2019m very proud of what we\u2019ve accomplished.\u201d Morgan Ortagus, a spokeswoman for the department, later disputed parts of Mr. Sondland\u2019s testimony. \u201cGordon Sondland never told Secretary Pompeo that he believed the president was linking aid to investigations of political opponents,\u201d she said. \u201cAny suggestion to the contrary is flat-out false.\u201d On Wednesday evening, a Pentagon official provided new details about when the Ukrainians might have learned about the hold on military aid. Laura K. Cooper, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia, told Congress that officials in Ukraine may have been aware by July 25 that security aid had been frozen \u2014 much earlier than previously known. That was the same day Mr. Trump talked on the phone with the president of Ukraine. She said the Ukrainian Embassy asked her staff about the aid on July 25, and also cited emails from that day between members of her staff and State Department officials in which diplomats said the embassy knew about the hold. As Mr. Sondland testified, Mr. Pompeo\u2019s future came up at a separate congressional session, the Senate confirmation hearing of Stephen E. Biegun, the envoy on North Korea nominated to be deputy secretary of state. Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, the top Democrat in the hearing, said Mr. Biegun could end up as acting secretary of state \u201cfor quite some time\u201d given expectations that Mr. Pompeo would resign early next year to run for Senate. He added that Mr. Pompeo could soon realize it is \u201cuntenable to continue making decisions\u201d on agency documents related to impeachment, so Mr. Biegun might assume that responsibility. Private testimony by David Hale, the third-ranking State Department official, has also implicated Mr. Pompeo. In spring 2019, Mr. Hale said, Mr. Pompeo looked into a right-wing campaign against Ms. Yovanovitch that had been orchestrated by Mr. Giuliani and his associates. Mr. Pompeo even called up Sean Hannity, the Fox News personality who is a Trump ally, to ask for details of wrongdoing by Ms. Yovanovitch, but concluded \u201cthere was no evidence,\u201d Mr. Hale said, according to a transcript. (Mr. Hannity has denied any such call.) Yet, in April, Mr. Pompeo complied with Mr. Trump\u2019s demand to oust Ms. Yovanovitch. After she was suddenly ordered to fly back to Washington that month for meetings, Mr. Pompeo\u2019s deputy delivered the news of her professional future. Mr. Pompeo has refused to defend her and the other top diplomats now under attack by Mr. Trump, leading to a quiet revolt against him by career officials and denunciations by former officials. For many in the diplomatic corps, the latest testimonies confirm the troubling portrait of Mr. Pompeo that has emerged this year. Some say he should resign, to restore leadership and correct the agency\u2019s direction. \u201cPeople are deeply concerned about the future of professional diplomacy,\u201d said Virginia Bennett, a former acting assistant secretary of state. She said a former colleague had told her that \u201cyou can see it across the building, this kind of degradation of capability.\u201d",

      "author": "Mark Mazzetti",
      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump on Friday released a memorandum of an April telephone conversation he had with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine that differed from a summary of the call released by the White House months ago. The memorandum of the call, which took place after Mr. Zelensky won a landslide presidential election, shows the two men praising each other\u2019s political acumen and predicting an era of warm relations between the United States and Ukraine. There is no mention of Mr. Trump\u2019s determination to have Ukraine\u2019s government investigate his political rivals \u2014 one subject of a July phone call that has become the focus of an impeachment inquiry in Congress. But a White House readout of the call in April offers a different account. In that summary, provided to reporters shortly after the call took place, the administration said that Mr. Trump promised to work with Mr. Zelensky \u201cto implement reforms that strengthen democracy, increase prosperity and root out corruption.\u201d A White House spokesman, Hogan Gidley, gave no explanation for the discrepancy but said \u201cit is standard operating procedure for the National Security Council to provide readouts of the president\u2019s phone calls with foreign leaders. This one was prepared by the N.S.C.\u2019s Ukraine expert,\u201d an apparent reference to Lt. Col Alexander Vindman, who has given damaging testimony about Mr. Trump in a closed-door deposition and is scheduled to testify in public next week. Colonel Vindman declined to comment. A person familiar with White House preparations did not know why language about corruption was included in the news release about the April phone call but said that talking points given to Mr. Trump before the call specifically mentioned corruption and the president chose not to discuss the issue with Mr. Zelensky. National Security Council aides had prepared the briefing materials and the news release together, an administration official said. But when Mr. Trump ignored their suggestion to bring up corruption, long a widespread issue in Ukraine, no one updated the release before the White House sent it to reporters, added the official, who was not authorized to discuss the matter and spoke on the condition of anonymity. On April 21, Mr. Zelensky, an unseasoned politician who promised to rid the country of its endemic corruption, won the presidency in a stunning victory. When he spoke with Mr. Trump that day, he said he admired Mr. Trump\u2019s outsider victory in 2016 and studied some of Mr. Trump\u2019s tactics. In the memorandum of the call released on Friday, Mr. Trump said, \u201cI have no doubt you will be a fantastic president,\u201d invited Mr. Zelensky to the White House and heaped praise on Ukraine. \u201cWhen I owned Miss Universe, they always had great people,\u201d Mr. Trump said, referring to the beauty pageant. The rough transcript released Friday was of a telephone call three months before a July conversation Mr. Trump had with Mr. Zelensky. During that call, Mr. Trump appeared to condition American military aid to Ukraine on whether Mr. Zelensky agreed to pursue investigations into the Biden family and he claimed that Ukrainians tried to undermine the Trump campaign in 2016. Last month, the acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, confirmed that Mr. Trump was indeed offering a quid pro quo during that July 25 call, but dismissed the controversy and said people needed to \u201cget over it.\u201d Mr. Mulvaney took back the declaration later that day. Mr. Trump has argued that the tenor of both phone calls was appropriate, but Colonel Vindman, who listened to both conversations, has told impeachment investigators that Mr. Trump\u2019s tone was noticeably different during the call this summer. \u201cThe tone in the call on the 21st of April was very positive, in my assessment. The call, the tone of the call on July 25 was not,\u201d he told investigators during the closed-door deposition. \u201cI\u2019m struggling for the words, but it was not a positive call. It was dour,\u201d Colonel Vindman said. \u201cThe difference between the calls was apparent.\u201d At the time of the April call, the White House had been buffeted by revelations contained in the special counsel\u2019s report on Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election \u2014 which revealed a pervasive Russian campaign and a vigorous effort by Mr. Trump to thwart the special counsel\u2019s work. \u201cHow do you impeach a Republican President for a crime that was committed by the Democrats? MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted that evening.",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Senate Finance Committee staff members met this month with an Internal Revenue Service whistle-blower who has alleged that senior Treasury Department officials tried to exert influence over the mandatory audit of President Trump\u2019s tax returns, a congressional aide said on Monday. The whistle-blower contacted the staff of the House Ways and Means Committee over the summer and accused political appointees in the Treasury Department of improperly involving themselves in the audit and putting pressure of some kind on senior officials in the I.R.S. The Ways and Means Committee has been reviewing the allegations, which were included in a complaint, and in early November the staffs of Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the Republican chairman of the Finance Committee, and Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the panel\u2019s top Democrat, interviewed the I.R.S. employee. The details of the allegations remain unclear, though a person familiar with the complaint has said that it did not directly implicate Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in the political meddling. Representatives for Mr. Grassley and Mr. Wyden declined to comment on the meeting with the whistle-blower, citing taxpayer privacy laws. \u201cWe generally do not comment on whistle-blower meetings, their contents or even if they happened,\u201d said Michael Zona, a spokesman for Mr. Grassley. \u201cAdditionally, federal law prohibits the discussion of protected taxpayer information.\u201d Mr. Grassley has been a strong proponent of the rights of whistle-blowers. In September, he introduced bipartisan legislation to extend protections to more people who report violations of securities and commodities laws. The Washington Post first reported the Senate meeting. House Democrats have sought to obtain six years\u2019 worth of Mr. Trump\u2019s personal and business tax returns. Mr. Mnuchin has refused a congressional request to release the returns and Mr. Trump has declined to release them, citing a continuing I.R.S. audit. The review of the whistle-blower\u2019s complaint in the Senate comes as Mr. Trump is locked in a protracted legal battle with Congress over the release of his tax returns. The complaint could potentially buttress the case that House Democrats need access to the tax returns as part of their inquiry into how presidential tax returns are audited. Two other investigations seeking Mr. Trump\u2019s financial information for other matters are headed to the Supreme Court. On Monday, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. temporarily blocked an appeals court ruling that required Mr. Trump to turn over financial records to a House committee. The brief order gave no reasons and served to maintain the status quo while the justices decided how to proceed.",

      "content": " Barry Lee Myers, whose nomination by President Trump to lead the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration remained unconfirmed by the Senate for more than two years, asked the White House this week to withdraw it, saying that surgery and chemotherapy made it \u201cimpractical\u201d for him to serve. Mr. Myers, the former chief executive of AccuWeather, a private forecasting company that relies largely on data from NOAA, was first nominated by Mr. Trump in 2017. But the nomination stalled in the Senate, leaving NOAA without a Senate-confirmed leader for the longest period since the agency was created in 1970. Democrats had argued that Mr. Myers\u2019s ties to AccuWeather would be a conflict of interest. Mr. Myers stepped down as chief executive in January 2019, but the company, founded by his brother, is still family-run. Mr. Myers\u2019s brother is the current chief executive. Democrats also criticized Mr. Myers\u2019s previous eagerness to privatize NOAA\u2019s National Weather Service and to fight government programs that would compete with AccuWeather services. The White House confirmed on Thursday evening that Mr. Myers had asked for the nomination to be withdrawn but did not answer questions about why. Mr. Myers could not immediately be reached for comment on Thursday. In an emailed statement about his decision, first reported by The Washington Times on Wednesday, Mr. Myers blamed Senate Democrats for delaying his confirmation because he supported the Trump administration. \u201cMy wife, my children and I have been unmercifully attacked by false news stories,\u201d Mr. Myers said. \u201cNone of this has discouraged me from serving this administration; in fact, all of these obstacles only increased my resolve to be confirmed.\u201d But he said that his \u201cmedical issues have made service to the nation impractical at this time.\u201d At a confirmation hearing in 2017, Mr. Myers acknowledged that humans are the primary cause of global warming. He said he supported the federal scientific reports on climate science, which Mr. Trump has said he does not believe. Mr. Myers was featured last month on an episode of HBO\u2019s \u201cLast Week Tonight\u201d with John Oliver, who highlighted his ties to AccuWeather. NOAA is responsible for understanding and predicting changes in the Earth\u2019s climate. It monitors oceans, helps coastal communities protect themselves from storms and manages fisheries. The agency\u2019s data helps create weather forecasts for severe events like hurricanes. The agency found itself at the center of a political firestorm in September when a National Weather Service forecasting office in Alabama assured residents that a hurricane would not hit the state, contradicting Mr. Trump\u2019s insistence that it would. NOAA then rebuked the Weather Service scientists, leading to criticism that the scientific agency had been politicized. The New York Times reported this month that emails and documents showed that NOAA knew the hurricane would not hit Alabama when it chastised the scientists.",

But a head-turning, at times partisan speech that Mr. Barr gave on Friday to the Federalist Society made sense from another perspective: He and other legal conservatives are on the cusp of victory in a generational project that traces back to the Reagan Revolution of the 1980s, and they know its perceived legitimacy will inevitably be intertwined with that of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency. That project has been to transform the judiciary \u2014 and use it to expand the legal scope of executive power and to achieve longstanding conservative policy goals like rolling back regulations and abortion rights. Mr. Trump brought conservatives closer to their aim by permitting stalwarts from the Federalist Society \u2014 the network of movement conservative lawyers founded in the Reagan years \u2014 to suggest judicial nominees whom he appointed. \u201cIt is critical to our nation\u2019s future that we restore and preserve in full vigor our founding principles,\u201d Mr. Barr said. \u201cNot the least of these is the framers\u2019 vision of a strong, independent executive, chosen by the country as a whole.\u201d But the executive power ideology of Mr. Barr \u2014 who praised Mr. Trump for having \u201ctaken up that torch\u201d with his judicial appointments \u2014 is more immediately rooted in the partisan battles of Ronald Reagan\u2019s 1980s than it is in George Washington\u2019s 1780s. Mr. Barr got his political start working on domestic policy for the Reagan White House, which was trying to curtail regulations, cut taxes, weaken unions and push a socially conservative agenda on issues like abortion and affirmative action. The administration separately tried to increase military spending and confront the Soviet Union and its proxies more aggressively. When congressional Democrats used their power to impede Reagan\u2019s agenda, like conducting oversight investigations into political appointees at regulatory agencies and outlawing support to anti-Marxist militants in Nicaragua, frustrated Reaganites began looking for ways to achieve their goals without congressional approval. At the same time, members of the conservative legal movement were calling for judicial restraint in part as a reaction to decades of liberal Supreme Court rulings. They developed the doctrine of \u201coriginalism\u201d \u2014 the notion that judges should interpret the Constitution based on its original meaning and not as a living document whose meaning evolves with society. Amid the swirl, Republican legal thinkers came to associate the goal of expanding executive power with Reagan\u2019s substantive policy agenda \u2014 turning it into a conservative tenet. And they sought to root this goal in originalism, developing arguments that the founders intended for fewer checks and balances on the presidency than scholars generally understood. A key figure in this ideological transformation was Edwin Meese III, a top aide to Reagan who eventually rose to attorney general. He brought in many aggressive young movement conservative lawyers and put them to work inventing theories of executive power that could help Reagan achieve his policy agenda unilaterally. On Friday, Mr. Barr opened his speech by talking about how honored he was to have worked alongside Mr. Meese, citing as a \u201cwatershed for the cause\u201d of the conservative legal movement \u201cthe decision of the American people to send Ronald Reagan to the White House, accompanied by his close adviser Edwin Meese and a cadre of others\u201d who embraced originalism. \u201cI am also proud to serve as the attorney general under President Trump, who has taken up that torch in his judicial appointments,\u201d Mr. Barr added. For much of the speech, he detailed the executive-power ideas that the Reaganites developed and he embraced. Essentially, their notion is that the mainstream understanding of separation of powers \u2014 that the Constitution divides government control among three coequal branches that share overlapping authorities so they can check and balance each other \u2014 is wrong. \u201cWhenever I see a court opinion that uses the word \u2018share,\u2019 I want to run in the other direction,\u201d Mr. Barr said. \u201cIt reminds me of my \u2014 there\u2019s a kid at my grandchild\u2019s preschool who, as soon as my grandchild is playing with a toy, reaches over, and says, \u2018Share? Share?\u2019\u201d Instead, in the Reaganites\u2019 view, each branch has near-total authority over its own domain. For example, Congress can create a Federal Reserve and empower it to set interest rates. But, their theory went, the part of that agency\u2019s law which also made its board independent from presidential control when deciding what rates to set was unconstitutional. Their theory was incompatible with a 1935 Supreme Court ruling upholding independent agencies. And in 1988, it failed again. Dashing the Reaganites\u2019 hopes, the court overwhelmingly upheld a law permitting independent counsels \u2014 prosecutors who wield executive power beyond presidential control. Mr. Barr brought up in his speech an aspect of the Reaganites\u2019 revisionist interpretation of how separation of powers works, sometimes called the unitary executive theory, drawing laughs by waving his hands and exclaiming \u201caaaahh!\u201d like someone scared by a ghost. He insisted: \u201cThis is not \u2018new\u2019 and it is not a \u2018theory.\u2019 It is a description of what the Framers unquestionably did in Article II of the Constitution.\u201d The audience burst into applause. For now, it is a theory, though it could become law if the new-look Supreme Court majority \u2014 including Mr. Trump\u2019s appointees of Justices Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh \u2014 eventually get a chance to overrule precedents. But existing court rulings belie Mr. Barr\u2019s boast that the theory is \u201cunquestionably\u201d true, as does skepticism about the work of Mr. Meese\u2019s team among an older generation of conservative lawyers \u2014 even some who worked in the Reagan administration. The Reagan legal team\u2019s vision for the separation of powers, despite its \u201cperfect logic\u201d and \u201cbeautiful symmetry,\u201d was \u201cnot literally compelled by the words of the Constitution. Nor did the framers\u2019 intent compel this view,\u201d Charles Fried, a Harvard professor and Reagan\u2019s solicitor general, wrote in his 1991 memoir \u201cOrder and Law: Arguing the Reagan Revolution \u2014 a Firsthand Account.\u201d Mr. Fried also disparaged Mr. Meese\u2019s cadre of young advisers who \u201cthought of themselves as revolutionaries\u201d for writing provocative speeches for Mr. Meese where he took \u201cextreme positions, such as questioning the constitutionality of independent agencies or suggesting that the president need not obey Supreme Court decisions with which he disagrees.\u201d Indeed, a dissenting voice appeared in a 1986 internal Meese Justice Department report on ways to expand executive power. It laid out the theory that government power is divided cleanly among the branches \u2014 not shared, as Mr. Barr also expounded on in his speech. In the report, which I uncovered in the National Archives while researching a book, this unidentified official warned that short-term political contingencies were clouding the administration\u2019s thinking about the long-term importance of maintaining congressional checks on executive power to limit government. Frustrated by obstacles to their political agenda, some conservatives were now \u201cinclined to make an exception to their usual respect for separation of powers and advocate a very strong president \u2014 primarily for the practical reason that an activist conservative currently sits in the White House, and they fear he may be the last,\u201d the dissenter warned. In light of that critique, one part of Mr. Barr\u2019s his speech was striking. He claimed that conservatives endorsed actions and principles that would be \u201cgood for society over the long haul if this was done in all like circumstances,\u201d while liberals used \u201cany means necessary to gain momentary advantage in achieving their end, regardless of collateral consequences.\u201d Defending Mr. Trump from the accusation that he has \u201cshredded\u201d constitutional norms and undermined the rule of law, Mr. Barr also said liberals were instead the ones guilty of that. Rather than behaving like the \u201cloyal opposition,\u201d he said, they have acted like Mr. Trump is not the legitimate president and set out to sabotage his duly elected government. And, in implicitly uniting his two themes, Mr. Barr invoked Mr. Trump\u2019s ban on travelers from several Muslim-majority countries. Lower courts blocked the administration from enforcing its ban, ruling that it was motivated by unconstitutional religious animus. But last year, the Supreme Court let a watered-down version of the ban go into effect. But in portraying that outcome as \u201cvindication,\u201d Mr. Barr did not mention that the Supreme Court ruling was 5 to 4. Mr. Gorsuch \u2014 whom Mr. Trump installed in the seat that Republicans, in an extraordinary exercise of constitutional hardball, would not let President Barack Obama fill in 2016 \u2014 provided the pivotal vote. The result foreshadowed the prospect of many more such vindications for the worldview of movement conservatives like Mr. Barr in years to come.",

      "author": "Michael Crowley",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 The prospects for a Trump administration plan to strike a Middle East peace deal have been receding for months, thanks to a protracted political stalemate in Israel and the refusal by the Palestinians to engage with Washington. But they may have reached a new low this week. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\u2019s announcement on Monday that the United States no longer viewed Israeli settlements in the West Bank as illegal under international law, coupled with a monthslong deadlock in Israeli politics that may require a new election to resolve, is casting further doubts that a long-awaited proposal from President Trump can resolve the 70-year territorial conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. Although Mr. Pompeo said the Trump administration\u2019s view on settlements would make peace easier to achieve, the Palestinians, along with many foreign governments and Israeli politicians, insist the opposite. And if there is an election to determine whether Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu can keep his job, it would not occur until early next spring. \u201cNobody believes this plan is coming,\u201d said Ilan Goldenberg, a top aide to President Barack Obama\u2019s chief Middle East negotiator, who recently returned from a weeklong visit to Israel, where he met with senior officials. \u201cThis did not come up once.\u201d Trump officials insist the plan, which was completed months ago under the supervision of Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, is still coming, although past predictions of timing have proved to be inaccurate. For the past two months, the White House has held off as Mr. Netanyahu and his chief political rival, Benny Gantz, the former Israeli Defense Forces general, have vied to form a new government after the country\u2019s inconclusive Sept. 17 election. But Mr. Netanyahu has already tried and failed to form a government. And if Mr. Gantz is unable to do so by midnight on Wednesday, Israel is likely to hold a new election in March. That, many analysts and some Trump officials believe, could prompt Mr. Trump to release his plan rather than wait until Israel finally settles on its political leadership. Mr. Kushner, deputized by the president early in his term to take on an account that has become a symbol of unsolvable problems, is said to be eager to do that. Mr. Kushner and Mr. Trump\u2019s Middle East envoy, the former Trump Organization lawyer Jason Greenblatt, crafted a plan whose details remain secret but is believed to slant heavily toward Israel on several long-contested territorial and political issues, including Israeli settlements. It tries to cushion the blow to Palestinians through major Arab investments in their economy lined up by Mr. Kushner. But the Palestinians have shown little interest in such a deal, and have long refused to communicate with Mr. Kushner and other Trump administration officials. Palestinian leaders say the Trump administration has adopted a punitive approach toward their interests through policies like recognizing Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital, cutting American aid to the West Bank and Gaza Strip, shutting down the Palestinian Authority Consulate in Washington and making Monday\u2019s announcement, which was widely seen as an endorsement of Israeli settlement building. Trump officials say that will not stop them, and some analysts say that submitting even a dead-on-arrival plan could appeal to the Trump team. \u201cThey see it more as a vision than as a plan,\u201d said David Makovsky, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy who worked as a Middle East peace negotiator in the Obama administration. The Trump administration hopes to establish \u201ca historic baseline, so if they\u2019re re-elected they can use it as a basis for future negotiations.\u201d In domestic political terms, Mr. Trump fashions himself as a grand deal maker and, as he seeks to build a re-election record, could benefit from being seen as offering a blueprint to resolve the conflict. A plan that asks fewer concessions of Israel than those devised by past White Houses would be popular among conservative Republicans, many Jewish voters in Florida and evangelical Christians who support maximal Israeli expansion. Any Trump plan would most likely \u201creframe United States policy to make a two-state solution impossible,\u201d said Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who served as a Middle East peace negotiator under presidents of both parties. \u201cGiven that Palestinian rejection of the plan is a foregone conclusion and there won\u2019t be an Israeli government capable of accepting the plan, launching it before the Israeli election makes no sense,\u201d said Martin S. Indyk, who served as the Middle East peace envoy for a year under Mr. Obama. \u201cUnless it\u2019s a plan so slanted in Netanyahu\u2019s direction that its release would be designed to help him.\u201d \u201cBut then it wouldn\u2019t be a peace plan; it would be a plan to help Bibi get re-elected,\u201d Mr. Indyk added. Even as a political document, a peace plan presents Mr. Trump with risks. Some prominent religious conservatives have warned that asking virtually any concession of Israel, especially in a traditional \u201cland for peace\u201d deal, would amount to a betrayal. Mike Evans, a member of Mr. Trump\u2019s evangelical advisory team, said in an interview on Tuesday that he did not expect that outcome. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that Donald Trump is a land-for-peace person. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to trade land or force them to give up land by people that want to kill them,\u201d said Dr. Evans, whom Mr. Pompeo called shortly after his announcement on settlement policy. \u201cWe\u2019ll release the plan when the time is right and when we think it has the best chance of success,\u201d Mr. Greenblatt said in an exit interview with the Arab publication Asharq al-Awsat when he returned to the private sector on Nov. 1. He has since been replaced by Avi Berkowitz, a 31-year-old adviser to Mr. Kushner. Mr. Trump has mostly kept his distance from the political scrum that has followed Israel\u2019s most recent election, on Sept. 17, when Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s failure to win a clear majority prompted the months of political jockeying that have followed. In the election\u2019s aftermath, Mr. Trump offered a seemingly cool tone toward his longtime ally. \u201cOur relations are with Israel,\u201d he said the day after the election when asked about Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s fate. In the two months since then, Mr. Netanyahu has tried and failed to form a governing coalition and now awaits the results of Mr. Gantz\u2019s effort. In the meantime, Mr. Netanyahu remains the country\u2019s prime minister, but lacks a political mandate to make weighty decisions. Mr. Trump sounded bemused by the state of affairs in a Nov. 12 appearance before a group of Orthodox Jewish supporters at a Manhattan hotel. The remarks were not released by the White House, but a video was posted on Twitter. \u201cWhat kind of a system is it over there, right, with Bibi and\u2026\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThey are all fighting and fighting.\u201d \u201cWe have different kinds of fights,\u201d he said. \u201cAt least we know who the boss is. They keep having elections and nobody gets elected.\u201d Relations have remained cordial between the leaders. But some analysts say Mr. Trump has been less effusive toward the Israelis than Mr. Netanyahu might like, given Mr. Trump\u2019s strong popularity within Israel, where, Mr. Trump joked at his New York event last week, he could easily win election as prime minister. Still, Mr. Trump sent Mr. Netanyahu a letter for his 70th birthday last month, calling the Israeli \u201cone of my closest allies.\u201d And after Mr. Pompeo\u2019s announcement on Monday, the two men spoke for the first time since before Israel\u2019s election. \u201cI spoke on the phone with US President Donald Trump and told him that he had corrected a historic injustice,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu wrote on Twitter after the call.",

      "author": "Dave Philipps",
      "content": " Anyone in the Navy can spot a SEAL by the gold insignia pinned to his chest: an eagle on an anchor, clutching a flintlock pistol and a trident. It is the badge of an elite band of warriors, one of the most revered in the military. The pin, known as the Trident, represents the grit of sailors who made it through some of the toughest training in the Navy, and are given some of the riskiest missions. It stands for fidelity and sacrifice. Even in death, the pin plays a role: SEALs pound their pins into the wood of fallen comrades\u2019 caskets. This week, the Trident became a symbol of defiance. Chief Petty Officer Edward Gallagher wore his pin when he reported to work on Thursday at Naval Base Coronado near San Diego. But that pin, and Chief Gallagher\u2019s 14-year SEAL career, had become the focus of an epic clash between President Trump and the Navy. Mr. Trump said in a Twitter post on Thursday that he would be personally intervening in a disciplinary proceeding, to ensure that the chief keeps his Trident pin \u2014 an exceedingly rare step by a president that undercut the authority of the SEALs leadership. The elite force has been rocked by a series of scandals in recent years, and the most prominent has been a war crimes prosecution centered on Chief Gallagher\u2019s 2017 deployment in Iraq. SEALs in his platoon told commanders and Navy investigators that they saw him shoot civilians and murder a wounded captive with a hunting knife, among other misconduct. When the Navy prosecuted Chief Gallagher, however, conservative lawmakers and media outlets took up his cause, and Mr. Trump intervened several times in his favor. When the chief\u2019s court-martial ended in acquittal on most charges, Mr. Trump congratulated him and lambasted the prosecutors. After the Navy demoted Chief Gallagher for the one relatively minor charge on which he was convicted, Mr. Trump reversed the demotion. This week, the commander of Naval Special Warfare, Rear Adm. Collin Green, played his final card in the case by starting the formal process of taking away Chief Gallagher\u2019s Trident pin and expelling him from the SEALs. But Mr. Trump countermanded the move. \n\n\u201cThe Navy will NOT be taking away Warfighter and Navy Seal Eddie Gallagher\u2019s Trident Pin,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter on Thursday. \u201cThis case was handled very badly from the beginning. Get back to business!\u201d An Instagram account belonging to Chief Gallagher and his wife soon reposted the message with the comment \u201cBoom\u201d and a series of explosion, flag and applause emojis. \u201cThe Navy follows the lawful orders of the president,\u201d Rear Adm. Charlie Brown, the Navy\u2019s chief of information, said in a statement on Thursday evening. Using an abbreviation for the chief\u2019s rank and status, the admiral wrote, \u201cWe will do so in case of an order to stop the administrative review of S.O.C. Gallagher\u2019s professional qualification. We are aware of the president\u2019s tweet and we are awaiting further guidance.\u201d The whipsaw reversal, after the Navy believed it had official approval to act, is the latest twist in the unusually public melee over Chief Gallagher, which has exposed a struggle in the SEALs to rein in rogue operators, while at the same time pitting the commander in chief directly against his senior Navy leaders The Navy\u2019s decision to start the process to oust Chief Gallagher, along with three SEAL officers who supervised him in Iraq, was not made in haste, according to Navy and Defense Department officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations. Admiral Green had discussed the matter with Navy Secretary Richard V. Spencer and the chief of naval operations, Adm. Michael Gilday, and the Navy briefed Defense Secretary Mark Esper about it. In the hours before Admiral Green issued formal notification letters to the four SEALs, two of the officials said, the Navy had reached out to the White House for clearance multiple times and had not received any pushback. They did not specify which White House officials were contacted. But mixed signals and reversed decisions are not uncommon in the White House, where rival aides with opposing views, and sometimes outside influences, jockey for the president\u2019s attention. The president announced the reversal shortly after Chief Gallagher\u2019s lawyer, Timothy Parlatore, appeared on Fox News, framing the Navy action as one of defiance toward the president\u2019s decision last week to restore Chief Gallagher\u2019s rank. \u201cMonday morning, the admiral comes in and says, \u2018I disagree with the president, I\u2019m going to take his Trident,\u2019\u201d Mr. Parlatore said. \u201cWhat he\u2019s doing here is really just an effort to publicly humiliate Chief Gallagher and stick it right in the president\u2019s eye.\u201d Chief Gallagher, 40, earned his Trident in 2005 after graduating from the Navy\u2019s punishing Basic Underwater Demolition course. He deployed with the SEALs five times, eventually becoming a platoon chief, and was repeatedly decorated for valor. He developed a reputation as an accomplished, battle-wise veteran. But the SEALs serving under him on the 2017 deployment told Navy investigators afterward that they came to see him differently, as a warrior who seemed more interested in killing than in leading, and who did not mind breaking the rules. And they said the chief\u2019s immediate superiors seemed more inclined to look the other way than to rein him in. The Navy moved this week to start the process of taking Tridents from three of those officers: Lt. Cmdr. Robert Breisch and Lt. Jacob Portier, who were implicated in not promptly reporting the allegations against Chief Gallagher, and Lt. Thomas MacNeil, who posed in a trophy photo with the chief and the corpse of a captive. Posing for that photo was the basis of the one charge on which the chief was convicted at trial. Mr. Trump made no mention of the three officers in his Twitter message on Thursday. The Navy later said it had paused all four Trident reviews while awaiting orders. Sailors stripped of their Tridents become pariahs, several SEALs said. Their careers are effectively over, and they are cast out of the SEAL community, officially marked as undeserving of the title that they worked hard to earn. Mr. Trump has had what people close to him described as a natural affinity for Chief Gallagher, seeing him as a military figure who was caught up in what Mr. Trump sees as the unpleasantness of war, but who had not intended to commit crimes. As commander in chief, the president has authority to intervene in military matters of all kinds, whether momentous or minute, experts say, but most presidents have given deference to the judgment of top officers. \u201cI\u2019m hard pressed to think of a time when the president reached this far down into the underbrush of military personnel issues,\u201d said Eugene Fidell, who teaches military law at Yale Law School. Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said that by reversing the admiral\u2019s action, Mr. Trump had done \u201ca real disservice to our troops.\u201d Scott Taylor, a Republican and retired Navy SEAL running for Senate in Virginia, urged the Navy to drop the Gallagher matter. Though the SEALs have \u201chad recent challenges in discipline, and there is needed corrective action,\u201d he said, \u201cthis particular case was deeply flawed from the beginning.\u201d \n\nPresidents have butted heads with senior commanders before over personnel matters. John F. Kennedy intervened to stop the punishment of an Army Reserve soldier who was court-martialed for bad-mouthing him. Abraham Lincoln infuriated some of his generals by regularly combing through court-martial orders for Union troops who were charged with desertion and other crimes and scrawling impromptu one-line orders for leniency, like \u201cLet him fight instead of being shot.\u201d Experts say the constitutional arrangement of civilian control over the military can become strained when a president disregards the counsel of generals and admirals, or never seeks it in the first place. \u201cThe president clearly has the authority, but historically the president and military leaders have communicated back and forth, coming to a mutual understanding,\u201d said Thomas Bruneau, who has taught classes on national security affairs at the Naval Postgraduate School. \u201cTo take precipitous action and override a senior officer is almost unheard-of.\u201d Still unknown is the impact that being publicly countermanded by Mr. Trump will have on Admiral Green, the commander who set the process of revoking Chief Gallagher\u2019s Trident in motion. Defense Department and Navy officials said that when Admiral Green discussed his plans with top Navy leaders, he acknowledged that the action could be opposed by Mr. Trump and might end the admiral\u2019s career. Navy Special Warfare did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Admiral Green. In an interview, Chief Gallagher\u2019s lawyer, Timothy Parlatore, said the admiral had to choose one of three courses of action: \u201cComply with the order and continue on; comply with the order and resign; or disregard the order and go to jail.\u201d Peter Feaver, a professor of political science at Duke University, said American military officers almost never resign in protest over disagreements with civilian leaders. \u201cIt is seen as undermining civilian control by creating a political conflict and weakening public confidence,\u201d he said. \u201cOfficers are supposed to serve, even if they might not agree.\u201d",

Pence Aide Listened to Trump-Zelensky CallMs. Williams, a veteran Foreign Service officer, testified that she found President Trump\u2019s call with Ukraine\u2019s president \u201cunusual and inappropriate.\u201dBy Michael D. ShearPRINT EDITIONNovember 20, 2019",
      "author": "Michael D. Shear",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 As the special adviser on Europe and Russia for Vice President Mike Pence, Jennifer Williams was one of a handful of national security officials who listened in real time to President Trump\u2019s July 25 telephone call with Volodymyr Zelensky, the president of Ukraine. Her recollections of that call \u2014 based in part on extensive notes she took as the two leaders spoke \u2014 have made the veteran Foreign Service officer a key witness in the Democratic-led inquiry into whether Mr. Trump should be impeached for trying to pressure Ukraine to open investigations into his political rivals. In closed-door testimony last month, Ms. Williams told lawmakers that she was taken aback by Mr. Trump\u2019s insistence during the call that Mr. Zelensky open investigations into former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., a candidate for president in 2020, and his son Hunter Biden, who served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company while his father was in office. She said that the conversation with Mr. Zelensky was \u201cmore political in nature\u201d than other calls with foreign leaders that she had listened to and that she felt it was \u201cunusual and inappropriate.\u201d Ms. Williams noted in particular the mention of \u201cBurisma,\u201d the name of the company that employed Hunter Biden. The reconstructed transcript of the July 25 call released by the White House did not include the word \u201cBurisma.\u201d But Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman, the top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council, also testified that when Mr. Zelensky is shown to have referred to \u201cthe company you mentioned,\u201d he actually said \u201cBurisma.\u201d Colonel Vindman said his attempt to correct the record of the call to include the company\u2019s name, and to reflect that Mr. Trump said that he had recordings of Mr. Biden, failed. On Tuesday, Ms. Williams is scheduled to testify in public, becoming the latest in a series of diplomats to express their concerns about the call. Over the weekend, Mr. Trump lashed out at Ms. Williams \u2014 \u201cwhoever that is,\u201d he tweeted \u2014 saying that she should read the transcripts of the July 25 call and another one between the two leaders that took place in April. \u201cThen she should meet with the other Never Trumpers, who I don\u2019t know & mostly never even heard of, & work out a better presidential attack!\u201d Mr. Trump wrote. A spokeswoman for Mr. Pence said merely, \u201cJennifer is a State Department employee.\u201d A White House official said some were not surprised by Mr. Trump\u2019s attack on Ms. Williams, whom the official described as an innocent bystander in the impeachment mess, and expressed disappointment that senior staff on Mr. Pence\u2019s team did nothing to defend her. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to offer a candid assessment. The person said it reflected poorly on the vice president that he was apparently unable to protect Ms. Williams from being publicly disparaged by the president. Ms. Williams joined the Foreign Service in 2006 after spending a year as a political appointee working for Michael Chertoff, the secretary of homeland security, in George W. Bush\u2019s administration. In addition to serving in Jamaica under Mr. Bush and in Beirut, Lebanon, under President Barack Obama, Ms. Williams spent about three years working for the State Department on the humanitarian crisis involving refugees in Syria. Six months before Mr. Trump became president, Ms. Williams was transferred to London to work as the deputy spokeswoman at the embassy there. But in April, she was assigned to Mr. Pence\u2019s staff, becoming one of his top foreign policy advisers even as the campaign intensified by Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, to pressure Ukraine on the investigations that the president wanted. Democrats are interested in what Mr. Pence knew about the effort to withhold security aid in exchange for a commitment to investigate the Bidens. During the closed-door deposition, Ms. Williams told lawmakers that she was not aware that the vice president was involved in any discussions about the investigations. She said Mr. Pence did not mention investigations to Mr. Zelensky. But Ms. Williams did shed light on one mystery related to Mr. Pence: why he abruptly canceled his planned trip to Ukraine to attend Mr. Zelensky\u2019s inaugural. Ms. Williams told lawmakers that an assistant to the vice president\u2019s chief of staff, Marc Short, told her in mid-May that Mr. Trump had asked Mr. Pence to stay home. Ms. Williams said she was never given a reason for the president\u2019s change of mind. The decision not to have Mr. Pence attend the inaugural celebration in late May was cited by the anonymous C.I.A. whistle-blower in the complaint that prompted Speaker Nancy Pelosi to officially begin impeachment proceedings.",

Shifts Tactics as Trump Attacks New Witness|November 18, 2019, Page A11",
      "author": "Sheryl Gay Stolberg",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 House Republicans, bracing for another week of impeachment hearings, asserted on Sunday that President Trump had done nothing wrong because his plans for Ukraine to investigate his political rivals never came to fruition \u2014 even as the president complicated their efforts by attacking another witness. On a day of back-and-forth on Twitter and the morning television talk shows that are a staple of Sundays in Washington, Speaker Nancy Pelosi invited Mr. Trump to testify before the House Intelligence Committee, while the president\u2019s allies shifted their emphasis away from the defense they offered last week, when they stressed that witnesses had only secondhand information against him. That argument may not work much longer, because lawmakers are about to hear from crucial witnesses who had direct contact with the president, including Gordon D. Sondland, a donor to and an ally of Mr. Trump who served as his liaison to Ukrainian officials while the president withheld \u2014 but later released \u2014 $391 million in military aid to Ukraine. \u201cThe Ukrainians did nothing to \u2014 as far as investigations goes \u2014 to get the aid released,\u201d Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s chief defenders, said on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cSo there was never this quid pro quo that the Democrats all promise existed.\u201d Ms. Pelosi, also appearing on \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d suggested that Mr. Trump \u2014 who is blocking key witnesses like Mick Mulvaney, his acting chief of staff, from testifying \u2014 make his case for himself, while delivering a brief lesson in Latin: \u201cIf he has information that is exculpatory, that means ex, taking away, culpable, blame, then we look forward to seeing it.\u201d Hours after that broadcast, Mr. Trump \u2014 who last week attacked Marie L. Yovanovitch, his former ambassador to Ukraine, on Twitter while she was testifying \u2014 unleashed an afternoon Twitter storm, lashing out at a second witness, Jennifer Williams, an adviser to Vice President Mike Pence. Ms. Williams, a longtime State Department employee with expertise in Europe and Russia who has been detailed to Mr. Pence\u2019s national security staff, is among those who listened to a July 25 telephone call in which Mr. Trump asked President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to \u201cdo us a favor\u201d and investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son Hunter. Mr. Trump had frozen the military aid about a week before. Ms. Williams told House investigators she thought the telephone call was \u201cunusual and inappropriate,\u201d adding, \u201cI guess for me it shed some light on possible other motivations behind a security assistance hold,\u201d according to a transcript of her deposition released Saturday evening by Democrats. \u201cTell Jennifer Williams, whoever that is, to read BOTH transcripts of the presidential calls, & see the just released ststement from Ukraine,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote, making a typographical error in the word \u201cstatement.\u201d \u201cThen she should meet with the other Never Trumpers, who I don\u2019t know & mostly never even heard of, & work out a better presidential attack!\u201d Mr. Trump later referred to a statement by the Ukrainian foreign minister, who said last week that Mr. Sondland never explicitly linked the aid to investigations into the Bidens. Ms. Williams is not the only witness who listened in on the call expected to testify this week. Others include Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman, the National Security Council\u2019s top expert on Ukraine, who has told investigators he was so alarmed by the call that he immediately reported it to council lawyers. But Mr. Sondland\u2019s appearance is the most anticipated. He has given somewhat contradictory accounts. While he had said in a text message that Mr. Trump did not seek \u201cquid pro quo\u2019s of any kind,\u201d he has also given a written statement to investigators in which he acknowledged that he told a top Ukrainian official that \u201cresumption of the U.S. aid would likely not occur until Ukraine provided the public anticorruption statement that we had been discussing for many weeks.\u201d On Sunday, Chris Wallace, the host of \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d pressed Representative Steve Scalise, the No. 2 House Republican, on that point, asking him whether Mr. Sondland might \u201cblow a hole\u201d in Republicans\u2019 defense. \u201cThe president\u2019s defense is that those things didn\u2019t happen,\u201d Mr. Scalise said, adding: \u201cThe real bottom line is he got the money. Ukraine got the money.\u201d Later, Mr. Trump attacked Mr. Wallace on Twitter. \u201c@SteveScalise blew the nasty & obnoxious Chris Wallace (will never be his father, Mike!) away on Chris\u2019s lowest rated (unless I\u2019m on) morning show,\u201d the president wrote. \u201cThis kind of dumb and unfair interview would never have happened in the @FoxNews past. Great job Steve!\u201d Both Mr. Scalise and Mr. Jordan have made such arguments before, but their remarks on Sunday suggest this will be Republicans\u2019 core line of defense this week. What the two congressmen failed to mention, however, is that Mr. Trump released the administration\u2019s hold on the money amid a bipartisan uproar on Capitol Hill and revelations of a whistle-blower\u2019s report that prompted the impeachment inquiry. Their responses underscore the difficulty party leaders face in fashioning a defense as evidence mounts against Mr. Trump. On Friday, the Democrats\u2019 case was bolstered by another witness, David Holmes, a top official at the United States Embassy in Kiev, who told investigators in a closed-door deposition that he had overheard Mr. Trump on a cellphone call loudly asking Mr. Sondland if Ukraine\u2019s president had agreed to conduct an investigation into one of his leading political rivals. \u201cSo, he\u2019s going to do the investigation?\u201d Mr. Trump asked, according to a copy of Mr. Holmes\u2019s opening statement. \u201cHe\u2019s going to do it,\u201d replied Mr. Sondland, who had just come from a meeting with top Ukrainian officials and the country\u2019s president, according to the statement. He also told Mr. Trump that Mr. Zelensky would do \u201canything you ask him to.\u201d Given such clear-cut accounts, some Republican strategists say the party ought to pursue an entirely different strategy. \u201cIn my judgment, the best defense is that the presidential election has already started,\u201d said Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster, \u201cand that we are better off, rather than putting the country through yet another incredibly divisive impeachment process, letting the voters cast the verdict on the Trump administration, which will occur in less than a year.\u201d Mr. Sondland, Ms. Williams and Colonel Vindman will be among eight witnesses to testify this week in open session before the House Intelligence Committee. The others are Kurt D. Volker, the former envoy to Ukraine; Timothy Morrison, a departing National Security Council official; Laura K. Cooper, the Defense Department official who oversees military aid to Ukraine; David Hale, the under secretary of state for political affairs; and Fiona Hill, a former National Security Council official with expertise in Russia. Republicans are looking to Mr. Volker to provide exculpatory evidence. He told investigators that Ukraine\u2019s leaders \u201cnever communicated a belief that there was a quid pro quo\u201d and that they were not aware early on of the withholding of military aid \u201cso there was no leverage implied.\u201d Mr. Sondland, meanwhile, has reversed himself on parts of his account. In his closed-door deposition, he told investigators he \u201cnever\u201d thought there was any precondition on the aid. But then he issued a written statement to investigators in which he acknowledged that he had told a top Ukrainian official that the country would most likely have to give Mr. Trump what he wanted \u2014 a public pledge for investigations \u2014 for the president to release the money. \u201cI said that resumption of the U.S. aid would likely not occur until Ukraine provided the public anticorruption statement that we had been discussing for many weeks,\u201d Mr. Sondland said in the new statement.",

Nixon or Bill Clinton, Mr. Trump will face an election after his impeachment battle if he isn\u2019t removed from office.By Peter BakerPRINT EDITION As Congress Plays to Draw, Voters Await|November 24, 2019, Page A1",
      "author": "Peter Baker",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 When it was all over and the witnesses had testified and the speeches were done, President Trump pronounced himself satisfied with the show. \u201cWe had a tremendous week with the hoax,\u201d he declared on Friday as he addressed a room of collegiate athletes. \u201cThat\u2019s really worked out incredibly well.\u201d Mr. Trump began the day with a 53-minute phone call to Fox & Friends in which he repeated a familiar list of accusations and falsehoods, which he amplified again on Saturday with a string of Twitter posts. Indeed, even after two weeks of hearings that presented compelling evidence against him, Mr. Trump was acting as if nothing had changed. In a way, it had not. Every one is playing their assigned role in a drama where the ending seems known in advance as the House of Representatives heads toward a likely party-line vote to impeach the president, followed by a Senate trial that will not convict him. But if the outcome of the showdown on Capitol Hill at the moment appears foreordained, the ultimate verdict still is not. Unlike Presidents Richard M. Nixon or Bill Clinton, Mr. Trump faces an election after his impeachment battle, meaning that the voters will serve as the court of appeals rendering their own final judgment on whether he has committed high crimes and misdemeanors. As a result, now that the House Intelligence Committee has laid out the evidence against Mr. Trump, the debate that will now play out on Capitol Hill will be aimed not at swaying lawmakers firmly embedded in their partisan corners, but at framing the issue in ways that will resonate with the public. The next few weeks could be critical in setting the parameters for a campaign that will decide if Mr. Trump is fit for office. \u201cThe impeachment jury is actually the smaller universe of voters in our country who are persuadable, swing voters who have avoided the tribalism plaguing most of our citizenry these days,\u201d said former Representative Chris Curbelo, Republican of Florida. \u201cTheir verdict will be issued next fall.\u201d While scholars and lawyers have argued the finer points of Article II, Section 4 of the Constitution, the main players in the drama have been studying poll numbers and fund-raising totals. Every day during the hearings, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and various organs of the Republican and Democratic parties blasted out emails and videos aimed at that jury beyond the Beltway. Members of the Intelligence Committee tweeted out their interpretations of the day\u2019s events to their followers from the hearing room dais, even as witnesses were still testifying. Impeachment was the first question asked at Wednesday night\u2019s Democratic presidential debate, which began barely an hour after that day\u2019s marathon hearing wrapped up. Both sides were fixated on the case study of Representative Elise Stefanik, a Republican from New York who vaulted to fame among conservatives and infamy among liberals for her fierce defense of Mr. Trump. After her Democratic opponent in next year\u2019s election reported raising $1 million from Trump critics outraged by Ms. Stefanik\u2019s performance, conservatives who once were suspicious of her moderate credentials rallied to her side and she was given prized slots on Fox News. \u201cWe just raised 250k in 15 MINUTES,\u201d Ms. Stefanik wrote on Twitter just hours after impeachment hearings concluded on Thursday. \u201cTHANK YOU! help us get to 500k TONIGHT.\u201d In five days of public hearings over two weeks, the committee heard from 12 witnesses, all of them current or former administration officials and most with years if not decades of public service under presidents of both parties. With an average of 12 million Americans watching each day, the testimony laid out in meticulous detail an effort by Mr. Trump and his lieutenants to pressure Ukraine into helping him tear down his domestic political rivals. Lawmakers were told that Mr. Trump wanted Ukraine to announce that it would investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. as well as a debunked conspiracy theory about Ukraine helping Democrats in the 2016 presidential election, the latter a figment of disinformation propagated by Russia, according to American intelligence agencies. Mr. Trump clearly conditioned a coveted White House invitation for Ukraine\u2019s president on his demand for the investigations and several witnesses said it was obvious he held back $391 million in American aid as leverage as well. Republicans poked holes in the testimony, making clear that none of the witnesses had actually heard Mr. Trump explicitly tie the security aid to the investigations, and they complained vociferously about the process, assailing it as tilted against the president. Some Republicans conceded that Mr. Trump did in fact do what he was accused of doing but maintained that it was not impeachable. Whatever the hearings revealed about Mr. Trump\u2019s conduct in office, they seemed to only reinforce just how polarized the country has become. No lawmakers declared that the evidence had changed their minds in either direction and judging by polls most Americans seemed to find only validation for the viewpoint they had when the hearings began. Indeed, listening to Republicans and Democrats, or their friendlier media, would give the impression of two radically different sets of hearings, one that presented damning, incontrovertible evidence that the president abused his power or one that revealed that the whole proceeding was a partisan sham. While polls before the hearings showed that 49 percent favored impeachment versus 47 percent who opposed it, a survey by Yahoo News and YouGov at the end of the hearings found support for impeachment at 48 percent and opposition at 45 percent. Other polls may eventually show movement but, at first blush, the drama of hearing the evidence presented out loud by real witnesses with evident credibility did not noticeably shift the overall dynamics. Democrats and Republicans alike privately agreed that it looked unlikely that even a single Republican would vote for impeachment when it reaches the House floor. In the Senate, Republican strategists said they believed they might lose two senators \u2014 Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska \u2014 while Democratic strategists said they also might lose two \u2014 Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona. \u201cWe\u2019ve just had this partisan divide ever since the Clinton years,\u201d said former Representative Barbara J. Comstock, Republican of Virginia. \u201cWhether it was Supreme Court nominations or this, it\u2019s just become a team sport, shirts and skins, no matter what the issues are.\u201d Steve Elmendorf, the top aide to the House Democratic leader when Mr. Clinton was impeached, agreed that lawmakers appear locked into their positions. \u201cExcept,\u201d he cautioned, \u201cwe are in the Trump show, where anything can happen. Two months ago, we did not think he was going to be impeached over a phone call we knew little about.\u201d Among the wild cards that could still change the dynamics might be testimony by some of the key witnesses who so far have refused to talk, including John R. Bolton, the former national security adviser who opposed the pressure campaign and is waiting for a court ruling on whether he should appear. Mr. Trump has long argued that an impeachment battle would help him politically by galvanizing his base against the elites trying to invalidate the 2016 election. While he has refused to provide testimony or documents to the House, arguing that the process is rigged against him, he is taking his case instead to evening rallies in sports arenas filled with supporters. Mr. Trump and his allies took heart from a Marquette University Law School poll showing him with small leads against each of the Democratic front-runners among voters in Wisconsin, one of the most critical battleground states for 2020. That poll, taken during the first week of hearings, showed that support for impeachment in the state had slipped by four percentage points to 40 percent. Speaker Nancy Pelosi was initially wary of pursuing impeachment unless it was likely to be bipartisan, recalling what happened to Mr. Clinton, who was impeached on a largely party-line vote in the House and acquitted in the Senate. House Republicans back then thought voters would reward them for pursuing impeachment of a president who lied under oath about a sexual affair with a former White House intern but instead it was Democrats who picked up seats in the 1998 midterm elections as the inquiry was underway. With that in mind, today\u2019s Democratic presidential candidates, while supporting impeachment, are treading lightly around it on the campaign trail, where voters generally do not bring it up. Instead, they emphasize issues like health care, gun control and income inequality, reflecting a fear about how impeachment will play come next fall. But Ms. Comstock, who was a Republican staff aide investigating Mr. Clinton during his presidency, said the conclusions drawn from the electoral consequences of his impeachment were too narrow. \u201cI do think both sides have maybe learned the wrong lesson,\u201d she said. While Republicans lost the midterm elections, they won the White House back in 2000 when Mr. Clinton\u2019s handpicked successor, Al Gore, fell short in the Electoral College despite running on a record of peace and prosperity. Eventually, Ms. Comstock said, the public tires of scandal and seeks to move on. Mr. Trump may win acquittal in the Senate, but that does not mean the public will be as forgiving. \u201cWhile they\u2019re now trying to make the best of it with fund-raising and saying this is going to help us, that fatigue\u201d may set in, she said. \u201cThere are people who just want a normal presidency.\u201d",

ShearPRINT EDITIONExpert Condemns Flow of \u201cFictions\u2019 on Ukraine\u2019s Role|November 22, 2019, Page A1",
      "author": "Nicholas Fandos",
      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 A former White House Russia expert on Thursday sharply denounced a \u201cfictional narrative\u201d embraced by President Trump and his Republican allies that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered in the 2016 election, testifying that the claim was a fabrication by Moscow that had harmed the United States. The expert, Fiona Hill, tied a pressure campaign on Ukraine by Mr. Trump and some of his top aides to an effort by Russia to sow political divisions in the United States and undercut American diplomacy. She warned Republicans that legitimizing an unsubstantiated theory that Kyiv undertook a concerted campaign to interfere in the election \u2014 a claim the president pushed repeatedly for Ukraine to investigate \u2014 played into Russia\u2019s hands. \u201cIn the course of this investigation,\u201d Dr. Hill testified before the House Intelligence Committee\u2019s impeachment hearings, \u201cI would ask that you please not promote politically driven falsehoods that so clearly advance Russian interests.\u201d Dr. Hill\u2019s account was an indirect rebuke of the president, as she outlined how some of Mr. Trump\u2019s team carried out a \u201cdomestic political errand\u201d in opposition to his foreign policy. She also underscored the national security consequences, noting that \u201cright now\u201d Russia was seeking to interfere in the 2020 election and that \u201cwe are running out of time to stop them.\u201d \u201cThese fictions are harmful even if they are deployed for purely domestic political purposes,\u201d said Dr. Hill, the British-born daughter of a coal miner who became a United States citizen and the White House\u2019s top Europe and Russia expert. She added that Russia readily exploited partisan divisions to undermine the United States from within. Both Dr. Hill and David Holmes, a top aide in the United States Embassy in Kyiv, detailed what they understood to be a concerted campaign that linked a White House meeting and vital military assistance to an announcement by Ukraine\u2019s president that his country would investigate 2016 election interference and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. \u201cInvestigations for a meeting\u201d is how Dr. Hill described her understanding of the deal laid out by the president\u2019s inner circle, including Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer; Gordon D. Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union; and Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff. The testimony came as Democrats sought to clarify the stakes of the impeachment proceedings after two weeks of detail-heavy hearings. Dr. Hill and Mr. Holmes may well have been the final public witnesses called by the committee, which has begun compiling a written report of its findings to present to the House Judiciary Committee as soon as next month. The House adjourned for Thanksgiving after the session, and it appeared all but certain that lawmakers would vote to impeach a president for only the third time in American history, and most likely along party lines. At the White House, Republican senators loyal to Mr. Trump huddled with senior presidential aides and the White House\u2019s top lawyer to begin charting out a Senate trial. Separately, Mr. Trump lunched with another group of Republican senators, including two occasional critics, Susan Collins of Maine and Mitt Romney of Utah, though the topic of his impeachment only briefly came up. On another front, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, signaled his intent to use the Judiciary Committee to mount an aggressive defense of Mr. Trump by focusing on Mr. Biden. In a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Mr. Graham asked for documents and communications with the former vice president, his son Hunter Biden, other officials from the Obama administration and former President Petro O. Poroshenko of Ukraine. During the hearing on Thursday, Republicans bristled at Dr. Hill\u2019s accusation, and after several tangled rounds of questioning, they used their time to push back on her suggestion that they refused to accept Russia\u2019s role in the 2016 election. \u201cNeedless to say, it\u2019s entirely possible for two separate nations to engage in election meddling at the same time, and Republicans believe we should take meddling seriously by all foreign countries,\u201d said Representative Devin Nunes of California, the panel\u2019s top Republican. Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio, went further, turning Dr. Hill\u2019s words around to accuse Democrats of advancing Russia\u2019s interests by pressing forward on the divisive process of impeachment. \u201cThey are doing exactly what Dr. Hill talked about,\u201d Mr. Jordan said, quoting from her opening statement: \u201cThe impact of a 2016 Russian campaign remains evident today. Our nation is being torn apart.\u201d In 2017, American intelligence officials released a report concluding that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia ordered a state-sponsored campaign to try to influence the 2016 presidential election. No evidence has emerged that there was a similar effort by Ukraine. Dr. Hill conceded during her testimony that Ukraine had \u201cbet on the wrong horse\u201d during the 2016 election, seeking to curry favor with Hillary Clinton in the belief she would win. But she added that Ukraine was hardly the only country that did so. \u201cThe difference here, however, is that hasn\u2019t had any major impact on his feelings toward those countries \u2014 not that I have seen,\u201d Dr. Hill said, referring to Mr. Trump. Despite Republican claims to the contrary, Democrats gained new information that could bolster their case. Under the Republican counsel\u2019s questioning, Dr. Hill said she confronted Mr. Sondland in July about his failure to coordinate with other members of the administration on his actions regarding Ukraine. She said she understood only later that Mr. Sondland was part of a group of high-ranking officials, including Mr. Mulvaney and Mr. Pompeo, who were \u201cbeing involved in a domestic political errand, and we were being involved in national security, foreign policy \u2014 and those two things had just diverged.\u201d Mr. Holmes said it was his \u201cclear understanding\u201d by the end of August that Mr. Trump had frozen $391 million in vital security aid to pressure Ukraine to commit to announcing an investigation into Mr. Biden and his family. \u201cBy this point,\u201d Mr. Holmes said, \u201cmy clear impression was that the security assistance hold was likely intended by the president either as an expression of dissatisfaction with the Ukrainians who had not yet agreed to the Burisma-Biden investigation or as an effort to increase the pressure on them to do so.\u201d Burisma is a Ukrainian energy company that employed Hunter Biden on its board. Mr. Holmes also offered a detailed account of a phone call he overheard between Mr. Trump and Mr. Sondland in Kyiv on July 26, a day after Mr. Trump directly asked President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine for the investigations. Mr. Holmes said he heard the president ask Mr. Sondland if Mr. Zelensky would conduct the inquiries he sought. Mr. Sondland assured Mr. Trump that \u201che\u2019s going to do it,\u201d and that the Ukrainian leader would do \u201canything you ask him to.\u201d Afterward, Mr. Holmes testified, the ambassador told him Mr. Trump did not care about Ukraine, only about \u201cbig things\u201d like the investigations. A day after Mr. Sondland laid out an extensive campaign to secure the political investigations, both witnesses said they had no doubt what Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani were seeking. Dr. Hill and Mr. Holmes both testified that references to investigating Burisma by Mr. Giuliani and other government officials were, in Dr. Hill\u2019s words, \u201ccode for the Bidens.\u201d Mr. Sondland and Kurt D. Volker, the former special envoy to Ukraine, had both said under oath this week that for months they believed Burisma was merely a reference to Mr. Trump\u2019s interest in eliminating rampant corruption in Ukraine. \u201cIt is not credible to me at all that he was oblivious,\u201d Dr. Hill said of Mr. Sondland\u2019s insistence that he did not realize that Burisma meant Biden. Dr. Hill also offered the most precise account to date of an awkward White House meeting with Ukrainian officials on July 10 that ended abruptly after Mr. Sondland told the visiting officials that they would need to commit to investigations. John R. Bolton, then the national security adviser, stiffened in his chair when Mr. Sondland made the comment, and he quickly cut off the meeting, she said. After the meeting ended, Mr. Sondland explained precisely what he was up to, Dr. Hill testified, referring to a deal with Mr. Mulvaney. \u201cThat he had an agreement with Chief of Staff Mulvaney that in return for investigations, this meeting would get scheduled,\u201d she said. The testimony on Thursday capped the first public impeachment hearings in two decades. Over two weeks, the Intelligence Committee heard from a dozen witnesses who described how Mr. Trump and his allies inside and outside the government shunted aside official American policy toward Ukraine in favor of an unorthodox, politically charged campaign. In an impassioned speech closing Thursday\u2019s session, Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the Intelligence Committee chairman, said it was clear to him the president had abused his power and tried to bribe another nation. He drew a direct comparison to Watergate, the scandal that took down President Richard M. Nixon, pleading with Republicans to confront an \u201cunethical president\u201d who believes he is \u201cabove the law.\u201d But neither Mr. Schiff\u2019s appeals nor witness testimony has made a visible dent in the president\u2019s Republican support in the House, where lawmakers offered a variety of defenses, including that there was no proof that Mr. Trump had done anything wrong. One of Mr. Trump\u2019s few Republican critics, Representative Will Hurd of Texas, conceded that testimony had shown that the Trump administration \u201cundermined our national security and undercut Ukraine,\u201d but said that it was not enough to justify impeachment. \u201cAn impeachable offense should be compelling, overwhelmingly clear and unambiguous,\u201d Mr. Hurd said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not something to be rushed or taken lightly. I have not heard evidence proving the president committed bribery or extortion.\u201d",

      "author": "Sharon LaFraniere",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Gordon D. Sondland, a West Coast hotelier and major Republican donor, gloried at first in his ability to hobnob with heads of state and parade his fledgling skills in international affairs after President Trump named him ambassador to the European Union last year. That was before the glare of the House impeachment inquiry cast him in an unflattering light as one of Mr. Trump\u2019s personal emissaries to Ukraine. Now national security officials describe him as \u201ca free radical\u201d in the delicate chemistry of diplomacy, an envoy with questionable ethical judgment and a disregard for security protocols whose notable strength was his seemingly direct line to the Oval Office. \u201cThis has been a very bad experience for me,\u201d Mr. Sondland testified last month at the start of the impeachment inquiry into whether Mr. Trump pressured Ukraine for his personal political gain. It is likely to get worse. At a public hearing on Wednesday, impeachment investigators are expected to confront Mr. Sondland about holes and inconsistencies in his closed-door testimony last month. Chief among them is his failure to disclose a July 26 phone call with Mr. Trump during which, another witness suggested, the two discussed whether Ukraine\u2019s president would publicly announce an investigation into Mr. Trump\u2019s political rival. Other testimony has called into question whether Mr. Sondland played down what he and Mick Mulvaney, Mr. Trump\u2019s acting chief of staff, did to press the president\u2019s demands; whether he mischaracterized the opposition of officials on the National Security Council; and at what point it became clear to him that Mr. Trump wanted Ukraine to announce an investigation aimed at former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who hopes to deny him a second term in the White House. Mr. Sondland is the witness who most concerns people close to Mr. Trump, several of them said, expressing worry that he interacted directly with the president about Ukraine and that they do not know what he will say. Mr. Sondland has already amended his testimony once, in writing. Mr. Sondland\u2019s statements look increasingly suspect, said Chuck Rosenberg, a former United States attorney and senior F.B.I. official who is following the hearings closely. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean he can\u2019t come in now and tell the truth,\u201d Mr. Rosenberg added. Mr. Sondland\u2019s recollection of his July 26 call with Mr. Trump might never have been questioned had not another American official overheard the conversation, conducted from Mr. Sondland\u2019s lunch table on the terrace of a restaurant in Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine. Mr. Trump was speaking so loudly that Mr. Sondland held the phone away from his ear, broadcasting the call to his dining companions. David Holmes, an American Embassy official in Kyiv who had joined the ambassador for lunch, said he clearly heard Mr. Trump ask whether Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine\u2019s newly installed president, was \u201cgoing to do the investigation.\u201d Mr. Sondland replied: \u201cHe\u2019s going to do it.\u201d After hanging up, Mr. Sondland said that Mr. Trump did not care a whit about Ukraine but was focused on \u201cbig stuff,\u201d like getting \u201cthe Biden investigation,\u201d according to Mr. Holmes. His account clashes directly with Mr. Sondland\u2019s statement that he recalled \u201cno discussions with any State Department or White House official about former Vice President Biden or his son.\u201d He also said he did not recall participating \u201cin any effort to encourage an investigation into the Bidens.\u201d Even if Mr. Sondland is now a damaged witness, he remains an important one. So far, he is the only one cooperating with the inquiry who dealt directly with Mr. Trump on Ukraine. Another witness, Kurt D. Volker, the special envoy to Ukraine, participated in an Oval Office meeting with Mr. Trump early on, but took a back seat to Mr. Sondland after that. For Mr. Sondland, a bald, blustery 62-year-old, the inquiry has upended his work. He used to boast to others that he could ring the president directly, complaining to one national security official that he was harder to reach than Mr. Trump. He told another colleague that Mr. Trump was often in a bad mood in the early morning. And Mr. Sondland became impatient when White House operators failed to promptly connect him to the Oval Office. Now his every exchange with the president is under scrutiny. Mr. Sondland once described himself as a \u201cresults-oriented,\u201d take-charge type. Now investigators are asking him why he pushed a so-called deliverable for the president \u2014 an announcement of the investigations \u2014 that other officials have said was ethically wrong and ran counter to American national security interests. Mr. Sondland also liked to present himself as a refreshing alternative to hidebound bureaucrats. Now some of those same bureaucrats have described him as an aggressive operator who elbowed them out of the way, rejected time-honored protocols and turned his personal cellphone into a national security risk. As national security adviser, John R. Bolton \u201cwas frustrated with Ambassador Sondland\u2019s involvement in these issues \u2014 frankly in a lot of issues,\u201d Timothy Morrison, a onetime top deputy to Mr. Bolton, testified. Although his concerns were widely shared, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo failed to rein in Mr. Sondland, Mr. Morrison said. Fiona Hill, Mr. Morrison\u2019s predecessor, told investigators that \u201call kinds\u201d of foreign officials were \u201cappearing at the gates of the White House, calling on our personal phones\u201d and demanding meetings that Mr. Sondland had unilaterally promised to them. Besides Mr. Sondland\u2019s July 26 call to Mr. Trump, the ambassador is expected to be questioned at Wednesday\u2019s hearing about what he and the president discussed during another conversation the previous day. Mr. Sondland testified that he had a \u201cnothing call\u201d with Mr. Trump before the president\u2019s now notorious conversation with Mr. Zelensky. But other witnesses said he told them he briefed the president on what to say to Mr. Zelensky. Another likely focus is whether Mr. Mulvaney promised a White House meeting for Mr. Zelensky with Mr. Trump if Mr. Zelensky announced the investigations that Mr. Trump wanted. Both Ms. Hill and Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman, another national security official, testified that Mr. Sondland told Ukrainian officials about Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s pledge during July 10 meetings at the White House. Ms. Hill also testified that Mr. Sondland and Mr. Mulvaney met \u201con a regular basis.\u201d But Mr. Sondland testified that he did not recall relaying any such promise from Mr. Mulvaney. He added that they had \u201cvery, very few conversations.\u201d Yet another bone of contention is Mr. Sondland\u2019s role as Mr. Trump\u2019s intermediary with Ukraine \u2014 a role he shared with Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer. Mr. Sondland testified that he worked through William B. Taylor, the top American diplomat at the embassy in Kyiv, and through Mr. Volker, the special envoy. \u201cWithout passing the buck, this was primarily Ambassador Taylor and Ambassador Volker\u2019s file,\u201d he testified, while he played a \u201csupport role.\u201d But other witnesses testified that Mr. Sondland was at the forefront of a shadow foreign policy toward Ukraine. \u201cIt was principally Sondland-led,\u201d Mr. Morrison said. Now, thanks to the impeachment inquiry, Mr. Sondland has plenty of room for the expansive role with Ukraine that he once craved. Mr. Volker, the special envoy, has resigned, as have three senior national security officials who criticized Mr. Sondland \u2014 Mr. Bolton, Ms. Hill and Mr. Morrison. But the ambassador no longer seems eager to embrace the part. He testified that he had not spoken to any Ukrainian official since Mr. Trump in late September released the transcript of his call with Mr. Zelensky that set off the impeachment inquiry. Mr. Sondland said the whole affair was just too \u201ccontentious with the White House.\u201d He said that a top aide to Mr. Zelensky texted him once, asking \u201csomething like \u2018Hello, how are you?\u201d He never replied.",

      "author": "Giovanni Russonello",
      "content": " Meetings of the American Association of Public Opinion Research tend to be pretty staid affairs. But when members of the group gathered for a conference call at this time in 2016, the polling industry was experiencing a crisis of confidence. Donald J. Trump had swept most of the Midwest to win a majority in the Electoral College, a shocking upset that defied most state-by-state polls and prognoses. An association task force, which was already working on a routine report about pre-election poll methodologies, was suddenly tasked with figuring out what had gone wrong. \u201cWe moved from doing this sort of niche industry report to almost like more of an autopsy,\u201d said Courtney Kennedy, the director of survey research at Pew Research Center, who headed the task force. \u201cSomething major just happened, and we have to really understand from A to Z why it happened.\u201d The group released its report the following spring. Today, with the next presidential election less than a year away, pollsters are closely studying the findings of that document and others like it, looking for adjustments they can make in 2020 to avoid the misfires of 2016. \u201cPolling is one of those things like military battles: You always re-fight the last war,\u201d said Joshua D. Clinton, who co-directs the University of Vanderbilt\u2019s poll and served on the AAPOR committee. The 2020 election \u201cmight have a different set of considerations,\u201d he said, but pollsters have an obligation to learn from the last cycle\u2019s mistakes. By and large, nationwide surveys were relatively accurate in predicting the popular vote, which Hillary Clinton won by two percentage points. But in crucial parts of the country, especially in the Midwest, individual state polls persistently underestimated Mr. Trump\u2019s support. And election forecasters used those polls in Electoral College projections that gave the impression Mrs. Clinton was a heavy favorite. AAPOR\u2019s analysis found several reasons the state polls missed the mark. Certain groups were underrepresented in poll after poll, particularly less educated white voters and those in counties that had voted decisively against President Barack Obama in 2012. Respondents\u2019 unwillingness to speak honestly about their support for Mr. Trump may have also been a factor. These and other issues could reappear in 2020, pollsters warn, if they\u2019re not addressed directly. To make sure their results reflect the true makeup of the population, pollsters typically \u201cweight\u201d their data, adding emphasis to certain respondents so that a group that was underrepresented in the random sample still has enough influence over the poll\u2019s final result. Polls typically weight by age, race and other demographic categories. But some state-level polls in 2016 did not weight by education levels, therefore giving short shrift to less educated voters, who tend to be harder to reach. This often understated Mr. Trump\u2019s support, since he was markedly more popular than past Republican nominees among less educated voters \u2014 and noticeably less popular among those with higher degrees, who research suggests are more likely to participate in polls. The AAPOR analysts found that many polls in swing states would have achieved significantly different results had they been weighted for education. This, in turn, would have noticeably decreased Mrs. Clinton\u2019s lead in much-watched polling averages and forecasts of these states. A Michigan State University poll that found Mrs. Clinton holding a 17-point lead in that state just before the election did not weight by education. If it had, her lead would have dropped to 10 points in that poll, the AAPOR researchers found \u2014 still a far cry from predicting Mr. Trump\u2019s narrow victory there, but a significant change. And a University of New Hampshire poll put Mrs. Clinton up by 16 points in that state on the eve of the election, though in the end she barely won it. That poll\u2019s gap would have closed entirely if its analysts had weighted for education, according to the AAPOR report. Some polling firms that did not weight by education in 2016 have since taken up the practice, but not all of them. Mark Blumenthal, the former head of polling at Survey Monkey and a member of the AAPOR task force, said that weighting by education ought to be accepted as necessary. \u201cI think that\u2019s a reasonable line to draw,\u201d he said. A pre-election study by Morning Consult warned that wealthier, more educated Republicans appeared slightly more reluctant to tell phone interviewers that they supported Mr. Trump, compared with similar voters who responded to online polls. Pollsters refer to this phenomenon as the \u201cshy Trump\u201d effect, or \u2014 in academic parlance \u2014 a form of\u00a0\u201csocial-desirability bias.\u201d Studies have affirmed that in races where a candidate or cause is perceived as controversial or otherwise undesirable, voters can be wary of voicing their support, especially to a live interviewer. Charles Franklin, the director of the Marquette University Law School poll of Wisconsin voters, said he worried that the shy Trump effect had played a role in skewing the poll\u2019s results away from Mr. Trump in 2016. Mr. Franklin, who was a member of the AAPOR team, suggested how telephone interviewers might confront the issue with respondents next year: \u201cWhen they indicate they\u2019re undecided or maybe considering a third-party vote, maybe push people a little more on whether they could change their mind,\u201d he said. One polling firm that showed Mr. Trump narrowly leading in some of the most inaccurately polled states \u2014\u00a0Michigan, Pennsylvania and Florida, all of which he won\u00a0\u2014 was Trafalgar Group, a Republican polling and consulting firm that uses a variety of nontraditional polling methodologies. It sought to combat the shy Trump effect by asking respondents not only how they planned to vote but also how they thought their neighbors would vote \u2014 possibly offering Trump supporters a way to project their feelings onto someone else. The AAPOR report posited that the neighbor question could help overcome shyness among Trump supporters, particularly in phone interviews. It \u201cwarrants experimentation in a broad array of contests,\u201d the report said. That was not the only way Trafalgar innovated. Polls typically use a formula based on past elections to determine which voters are likely to show up on Election Day. They then discard or devalue responses from those who seem less predisposed \u2014 typically those without much history of voting, or who don\u2019t express much enthusiasm about politics. Trafalgar used a generously inclusive model, with a particular eye toward less frequent voters whom Mr. Trump\u2019s anti-establishment campaign had drawn in. \u201cWith Trump, we saw in the primary how new people were being brought into the process, and so we widened the net of who we reached out to,\u201d Robert C. Cahaly, a pollster at Trafalgar, said in an interview. When the Census Bureau in 2017 released detailed voting information from the 2016 election, it revealed that turnout had surged in many counties that Mr. Obama had lost by 10 points or more in 2012 \u2014 particularly in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. It is a reminder that who voted in the previous election is not always a good indicator of who will vote the next time. \u201cThis is where the art comes in, and it\u2019s hard to know until it actually happens which approach is the best approach,\u201d Mr. Clinton said, referring to how polling firms construct their likely-voter models. The polls from 2016 make clear that finding a representative sample is both the hardest and the most important part of conducting an effective survey. This is not new knowledge for public-opinion professionals, but many said it was a lesson worth relearning. Compounding all the other factors in 2016 was the simple fact that \u2014 in a race with two historically unpopular candidates \u2014 many voters didn\u2019t reach a decision until just before Election Day. In Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, between 13 and 15 percent of respondents in exit polls said they had decided in the last week of the campaign. Those voters broke for Mr. Trump by a wide margin; in Wisconsin, it was about 30 points. Pew researchers also called back respondents of their pre-election polls and found that many had changed their minds and voted differently than they\u2019d said they would, which is not uncommon. But these voters broke for Mr. Trump by a 16-point margin \u2014 a heavier tilt than in any other year on record. So, in a volatile election, even a perfectly effective poll might not be able to gauge the outcome; a poll can only take the pulse of where voters\u2019 feelings lie in a particular moment. That points to a major source of agita for some observers of the 2016 election: electoral forecasts in the news media and elsewhere that used polling data to suggest Mrs. Clinton was highly likely to win. Most of them put her chances at somewhere between 70 and 99 percent. \u201cI\u2019m not sure people understand how these probabilistic projections are produced or what they mean,\u201d Gary Langer, a pollster who works with ABC News, said in an email. \u201cI\u2019d suggest that predicting election outcomes is the least important contribution of pre-election polls. Bringing us to a better understanding of how and why the nation comes to these choices is the higher value that good-quality polls provide.\u201d Election forecasters do not mean to convey absolute certainty. Just before Election Day, The New York Times\u2019s Upshot forecast gave Mr. Trump a 15 percent chance of winning, and FiveThirtyEight\u2019s model put his chances at 29 percent, indicating that a Republican win was not out of the question. But the Princeton Election Consortium, which had predicted the 2012 results with striking accuracy, was more certain of a Clinton win, giving her a 99 percent chance in the days leading up to the election. Sam Wang, a neuroscientist who runs the Princeton model, said in an email that in 2016 he had not factored in enough potential \u201csystematic error\u201d \u2014 a catchall variable that accounts for imperfections in individual polls. In 2016, he never set that variable higher than 1.1 percentage points, but in 2020 he plans to set it at two points. \u201cThat will increase the uncertainty much more,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich will set expectations appropriately in case the election is close.\u201d",

      "author": "Adam Liptak",
      "content": " The Justice Department filed a friend-of-the-court brief on Friday urging the Supreme Court to hear President Trump\u2019s appeal seeking to keep his financial records private. Mr. Trump is trying to block a subpoena from Manhattan prosecutors that would require his accounting firm to turn over eight years of his personal and corporate tax returns. The brief did not adopt the broad position taken by Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyers in a petition filed last week \u2014 that he is immune from criminal investigation while he remains in office. Rather, the department\u2019s brief said that courts should require prosecutors to meet a more demanding standard before they are allowed to obtain the information. The brief took pains to say that there was nothing unusual about the department\u2019s participation in the case, noting that it had previously filed friend-of-the-court briefs in  cases in which Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Bill Clinton had claimed immunity in civil suits. \u201cThe United States has a substantial interest in protecting the office of the president and the powers and duties vested in that office,\u201d the brief said. \u201cThe United States also has a substantial interest in protecting the autonomy of the federal government from potential interference by the states.\u201d The subpoena from the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., a Democrat, threatened both interests, the brief said. \u201cThis case involves the first attempt in our nation\u2019s history by a local prosecutor to subpoena personal records of the sitting president of the United States,\u201d the brief said. The subpoena sought information concerning the reimbursements made to the president\u2019s former lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, for payments to Stormy Daniels, a pornographic film actress who said she had an affair with Mr. Trump. The president has denied the relationship. A unanimous three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in Manhattan, ruled this month against Mr. Trump. The court, in a focused ruling, said state prosecutors may require third parties to turn over a sitting president\u2019s financial records for use in a grand jury investigation. The Justice Department\u2019s brief said that ruling was novel. \u201cThe United States is unaware of any precedent for the issuance of a state criminal subpoena for a sitting president\u2019s personal records, and the district attorney and the courts below have never identified one,\u201d the brief said. \u201cLeaving local prosecutors with unfettered authority to issue such subpoenas creates a serious risk that those prosecutors \u2014 prioritizing local concerns and disregarding significant federal interests \u2014 may subject the president to highly burdensome demands for information,\u201d the brief said. The solution, according to the Justice Department, is to insist that the prosecutors show that the information sought is essential to a pending criminal case and that it cannot be obtained elsewhere. To date, the brief said, Mr. Vance has made neither showing. The Supreme Court is expected to announce in the coming weeks whether it will hear the case from Manhattan as well as a second one arising from a subpoena from a House committee. \u201cThis court \u2014 not a lower federal court \u2014 should decide,\u201d the Justice Department said, \u201cwhether the type of intrusion on the presidency at issue in this case is permissible.\u201d",

      "author": "Peter Baker",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 The White House sought on Monday night to quell a torrent of speculation about President Trump\u2019s health two days after a mysterious, unannounced visit to the hospital, denying that he was treated for an emergency and insisting that it was just \u201cregular, primary preventive care.\u201d \u201cDespite some of the speculation, the president has not had any chest pain, nor was he evaluated or treated for any urgent or acute issues,\u201d Cmdr. Sean P. Conley, the president\u2019s Navy physician, wrote in a memo released by the White House in an unusual late-night statement. \u201cSpecifically, he did not undergo any specialized cardiac or neurologic evaluations.\u201d Mr. Trump was taken on Saturday to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in his motorcade in a trip that had not been listed on his public schedule. He stayed for about two hours for what White House officials said were routine tests, but since the visit had not been revealed in advance and came only nine months after his last annual physical, it touched off much discussion about whether the president had an undisclosed health issue. Mr. Trump, 73, is the oldest man ever sworn in for a first term as president, and he is not known for a healthy diet or exercise other than weekend golf. At his February checkup, he weighed in at 243 pounds, which is considered obese for a man of his reported height of 6-foot-3. He has been reported in the past to be taking rosuvastatin, a lipid-lowering drug, to control his cholesterol. Dr. Conley reported that his latest test showed Mr. Trump\u2019s cholesterol at 165, down from 196 in February. His LDL has fallen to 84, from 122, while his HDL was 70, up from 58. The doctor did not release results of any other tests, if conducted, including an updated weight. In his memo, Dr. Conley called Saturday\u2019s visit \u201ca routine, planned interim checkup as part of the regular, primary preventative care he receives throughout the year.\u201d He said it was not announced in advance \u201cdue to scheduling uncertainties,\u201d without explaining further. Dr. Conley also made no mention of whether Mr. Trump underwent a routine colonoscopy, which his physician at the time said in January 2018 would be conducted at his next regular exam. The president\u2019s doctors did not say in February whether he had one then. After the February exam, Dr. Conley described Mr. Trump as being in \u201cvery good health.\u201d He made no characterization one way or the other in Monday night\u2019s statement, but brushed off concerns generated by the Saturday visit. \u201cPrimary preventative medical care is something that occurs continuously throughout the year, it is not just a single annual event,\u201d Dr. Conley said. \u201cAs such, I will continue to monitor the president\u2019s health, planning on a more comprehensive examination after the new year.\u201d",

      "author": "Michael D. Shear",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Tim Morrison, a hawkish senior national security aide and Trump loyalist in the White House, may be the best chance Republicans have for an impeachment witness who helps back up their defense of President Trump. Mr. Morrison, a longtime arms control expert who worked in Republican congressional offices for more than a decade, moved to the White House last year to work with John R. Bolton, then the president\u2019s equally hawkish national security adviser. Now, Mr. Morrison is expected to testify on Tuesday afternoon that he heard nothing illegal as he listened in real time to a July 25 telephone call between Mr. Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky, the president of Ukraine. That assessment and his fierce commitment to Mr. Trump and Mr. Bolton \u2014 he has been called Mr. Bolton without the mustache \u2014 have made him a priority witness for the president\u2019s defenders as the impeachment inquiry moves into a second week of public hearings, and Republicans put him on a list of witnesses they requested. Mr. Morrison, a political appointee at the White House, told lawmakers that Ukraine was not a big part of his arms control portfolio until July 2019, when he became the deputy assistant to the president for national security in charge of Russia policy. That was just weeks before the call between Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky that eventually prompted Democrats to officially begin the impeachment inquiry. Democrats say that despite his loyalty to Mr. Trump, Mr. Morrison backs up their main argument for impeaching the president: that military assistance for Ukraine was held up to pressure the country\u2019s leaders to announce investigations of the president\u2019s political rivals. In his closed-door testimony last month, Mr. Morrison described a call between the president and Gordon D. Sondland, a donor to Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration and the United States ambassador to the European Union, in which Mr. Trump insisted that Ukraine must publicly announce investigations into former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son and other Democrats. Mr. Morrison has also testified that he and Mr. Bolton were deeply skeptical of efforts by Mr. Sondland and Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, to conduct a shadow Ukraine foreign policy. In his testimony, he revealed a private meeting in which Mr. Bolton and others tried unsuccessfully to persuade Mr. Trump to release the aid to Ukraine. But Republicans are likely to focus on the parts of Mr. Morrison\u2019s testimony that support their arguments on behalf of the president. Unlike some of his colleagues, Mr. Morrison has said he was \u201cnot concerned that anything illegal was discussed\u201d on the July 25 call. (Jennifer Williams, a top national security aide to Vice President Mike Pence, said the call was more political than usual and was \u201cunusual and inappropriate.\u201d) And Mr. Morrison also testified that the reconstructed transcript of the call was placed on a highly secure server by mistake, potentially undercutting the Democratic argument that the White House did so as part of a cover-up. Representative Jim Jordan, an Ohio Republican who was temporarily added to the House Intelligence Committee so he could aggressively question the Democratic witnesses, tweeted over the weekend that Mr. Morrison would back up his party\u2019s arguments. Ronna McDaniel, the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, retweeted Mr. Jordan and criticized Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the chairman of the Intelligence Committee. \u201cMore testimony that vindicates @realDonaldTrump,\u201d she wrote. \u201cPelosi and Schiff are grasping at straws.\u201d Mr. Morrison announced on the eve of his closed-door testimony that he would be leaving his position at the White House, though he insisted that his departure was unrelated to the Ukraine situation or his decision to testify.",

      "author": "Adam Liptak",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. on Monday temporarily blocked an appeals court ruling that required President Trump to turn over financial records to a House committee. The brief order gave no reasons and served to maintain the status quo while the justices decided how to proceed. In a letter to the court earlier on Monday, lawyers for the committee said they did not oppose a brief interim stay. In entering one, the chief justice ordered the committee\u2019s lawyers to file papers on whether to grant a longer stay by Thursday. If the justices grant a longer stay, they will next consider whether to hear Mr. Trump\u2019s appeal. The case, concerning a subpoena from the House Oversight and Reform Committee, is one of two cases before the Supreme Court in which Mr. Trump is seeking to halt disclosures of his financial records by his accounting firm, Mazars USA. The other case concerns a subpoena from Manhattan prosecutors to the firm seeking eight years of his personal and business tax returns. The Supreme Court is expected to announce whether it will hear the appeals in the coming weeks. If it declines to step in, appeals court rulings requiring disclosure will stand, and Mazars has indicated that it will supply the requested records. If the Supreme Court agrees to hear the cases, it will probably hear arguments early next year and issue decisions by June. No stay from the Supreme Court was needed in the Manhattan case because prosecutors there had agreed not to seek immediate release of the records in exchange for a prompt request for Supreme Court review. There was no such agreement in the House case. \u201cIt has now been seven months since the Oversight Committee asked for these records,\u201d Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, a New York Democrat and the committee\u2019s acting chairwoman, said in a statement last week. \u201cIt is time for the president to let us do our job and stop blocking Mazars from complying with the committee\u2019s lawful subpoena.\u201d Both subpoenas sought information concerning hush-money payments made in the run-up to the 2016 election. Mr. Trump and his company reimbursed the president\u2019s former lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, for payments to the pornographic film actress Stormy Daniels, who said she had an affair with Mr. Trump. The president has denied the relationship. The House subpoena also sought records prompted by Mr. Cohen\u2019s testimony that Mr. Trump had inflated and deflated descriptions of his assets on financial statements to obtain loans and reduce his taxes. Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers argued that the House committee was powerless to obtain his records because it had no legislative need for them. They said the panel was engaged in an improper criminal inquiry and was not seeking information to help it enact legislation. Lawyers for the committee responded that the records were needed for multiple, proper reasons; that courts should not second-guess congressional decision-making; and that the committee had the authority to issue subpoenas without separate authorization by the full House. In October, a divided three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit refused to block the subpoena. \u201cHaving considered the weighty interests at stake in this case, we conclude that the subpoena issued by the committee to Mazars is valid and enforceable,\u201d Judge David S. Tatel, who was appointed by President Bill Clinton, wrote for the majority. Judge Patricia A. Millett, appointed by President Barack Obama, joined the majority opinion. In dissent, Judge Neomi J. Rao, appointed by Mr. Trump, wrote that \u201callegations of illegal conduct against the president cannot be investigated by Congress except through impeachment.\u201d In the case concerning the grand jury subpoena in New York, Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers made a different argument, saying that he was immune from all criminal proceedings and investigations so long as he remained in office. But even if some federal investigations may be proper, they said, the Supreme Court should rule that state and local prosecutors may not seek information about a sitting president\u2019s conduct. \u201cThat the Constitution would empower thousands of state and local prosecutors to embroil the president in criminal proceedings is unimaginable,\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers wrote. Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers noted that the Supreme Court heard cases concerning claims of immunity from Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Clinton. \u201cThe court should do the same here,\u201d the petition said. \u201cWhether the Constitution permits an assertion of this kind of authority over the chief executive raises a momentous question of first impression about the scope of presidential immunity.\u201d In the two earlier cases, United States v. Nixon in 1974 and Clinton v. Jones in 1997, both presidents suffered unanimous losses. On Nov. 4, a unanimous three-judge panel of a federal appeals court in Manhattan ruled against Mr. Trump. The court, in a focused ruling, said state prosecutors may require third parties to turn over a sitting president\u2019s financial records for use in a grand jury investigation.",

      "author": "Sheryl Gay Stolberg",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 As the impeachment inquiry has picked up speed in recent weeks, Americans have heard a lot about the \u201cthree amigos\u201d \u2014 a trio of Washington figures who worked with President Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, to carry out Mr. Trump\u2019s plan for Ukraine to investigate his political rivals. Tuesday afternoon, the first of the amigos \u2014 Kurt D. Volker, Mr. Trump\u2019s former special envoy to Ukraine \u2014 will testify before the House Intelligence Committee. Mr. Volker is a career diplomat who served as the United States\u2019 permanent representative to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization under President George W. Bush and was most recently the executive director of the McCain Institute for International Leadership, a Washington-based research group affiliated with Arizona State University. In 2017, he volunteered to be Mr. Trump\u2019s envoy to Ukraine, but resigned abruptly on Sept. 27, one day after the release of an explosive whistle-blower\u2019s complaint that revealed he had been working as a go-between to connect Ukrainian officials to Mr. Giuliani in a back-channel effort at shadow diplomacy. Republicans and Democrats both believe Mr. Volker has something important to say. Democrats are eager to have him testify because of text messages between him, Mr. Giuliani and another of the amigos, Gordon D. Sondland, Mr. Trump\u2019s ambassador to the European Union. The messages reveal that Mr. Trump was trying to pressure President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to investigate a discredited theory about Ukraine\u2019s involvement in the 2016 elections, as well as former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son Hunter, by dangling two things Mr. Zelensky coveted: a White House meeting with Mr. Trump, and $391 million in military aid that Congress had approved for Ukraine, but which the president was refusing to release. (Mr. Sondland will testify Wednesday; the third amigo, Energy Secretary Rick Perry, is not on the list of witnesses.) \u201cHeard from White House \u2014 assuming President Z convinces trump he will investigate / \u2018get to the bottom of what happened\u2019 in 2016, we will nail down date for a visit to Washington,\u201d Mr. Volker wrote to a top aide to Mr. Zelensky on July 25, the same day that the two presidents spoke by phone in a conversation that is now central to the inquiry. But Republicans believe Mr. Volker can help exonerate Mr. Trump, because during his closed-door testimony he said that he was not aware of any quid pro quo that tied the investigations Mr. Trump sought to military aid. Mr. Volker plans to testify that he was out of the loop at key moments during the events in question. Mr. Volker was the first witness to testify in the impeachment inquiry behind closed doors in October. He told investigators that \u201cat no time was I aware of or took part in an effort to urge Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Biden.\u201d He said that Mr. Biden was \u201cnever a topic of discussion\u201d in the text messages. But the messages include references to Burisma, the Ukrainian energy company on whose board Hunter Biden served. On the surface, Mr. Volker appears more loyal to Mr. Trump than the other career diplomats who have testified. In 2016, he pleaded with two former Republican officials not to publish a letter promoting the \u201cNever Trumper\u201d movement. Mr. Volker, 54, began his government career as an analyst with the C.I.A., and joined the State Department as a Foreign Service officer in 1988. His overseas assignments included London, Brussels and Budapest. He rose through the ranks, eventually becoming the deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs under Mr. Bush, but was pushed out when President Barack Obama took office. While serving as the unpaid, part-time special envoy, Mr. Volker also worked as a strategic adviser to BGR Group, a firm that has lobbied on behalf of Ukraine. But the Ukraine inquiry cost him his job at the McCain Institute, established by former Senator John McCain, which Mr. Volker had led since 2012. He resigned last month, saying the investigation would be a distraction.",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump on Thursday greeted the families of two soldiers killed in Afghanistan a day earlier, the third such visit he has made to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware to honor the dead and comfort their relatives. At the last minute, the president invited the actor Jon Voight, an outspoken Trump supporter, to accompany him and the first lady, Melania Trump, to witness the solemn ritual of transferring the metal cases holding the remains from a plane that brought them back to the United States. The two Army soldiers, David C. Knadle of Tarrant County, Texas, and Kirk T. Fuchigami Jr. of Keaau, Hawaii, chief warrant officer 2s, were killed in a helicopter crash in Afghanistan, Defense Department officials said. Mr. Trump and Mrs. Trump met privately with family members of the fallen. During a brief ceremony, the president and first lady stood in silence as soldiers carried the two metal cases from a cargo hold into a waiting van. The president gave a crisp salute each time a case was moved. In recent public statements, Mr. Trump has repeatedly pointed to the human cost of wars that have continued under his administration to describe his opposition to foreign interventions. At times, he has spoken in graphic terms, describing seeing families screaming in anguish. \u201cThe hardest thing I have to do, by far, much harder than the witch hunt, is signing letters to parents of soldiers that have been killed,\u201d he said last month. The president did not address reporters as he left the air base, or when he returned to Joint Base Andrews outside Washington. Asked about his presence, Mr. Voight said that he had been invited that day during the medal ceremony honoring his contribution to the arts. \u201cHe said \u2018If you\u2019d like to come, you can come,\u2019\u201d Mr. Voight recalled. \u201cThere was no intention of meeting the families or any of that.\u201d",

      "content": " President Trump underwent a two-hour doctor\u2019s examination on Saturday at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, which the White House said was part of a routine annual physical and included lab work. The appointment was not on the president\u2019s schedule, in contrast to a previous physical that Mr. Trump had in February, also at Walter Reed outside Washington. In a statement, Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary, said Mr. Trump, 73, was taking advantage of a free weekend to begin portions of his annual physical, and was anticipating a busy schedule in 2020. She did not specify what types of tests Mr. Trump had. \u201cThe president remains healthy and energetic without complaints, as demonstrated by his repeated vigorous rally performances in front of thousands of Americans several times a week,\u201d Ms. Grisham said. It was Mr. Trump\u2019s ninth visit to Walter Reed as president, Ms. Grisham said, adding that Mr. Trump met with the family of a special forces soldier who was injured in Afghanistan while he was at the hospital. \u201cThe President also stopped by to say hello to the medical staff of Walter Reed, to share his thanks for all the outstanding care they provide to our Wounded Warriors, and wish them an early happy Thanksgiving,\u201d Ms. Grisham said. After his February physical, Mr. Trump\u2019s personal physician said that the president was in \u201cvery good health\u201d and that he should remain so \u201cfor the remainder of his presidency and beyond.\u201d But Dr. Sean Conley, a Navy officer who is the president\u2019s physician, released scant details about the physical examinations that Mr. Trump underwent, or their results, as a White House physician did for President Barack Obama. Mr. Trump\u2019s weight was listed at 243 pounds after his last physical, a four pound gain since his 2018 physical. At 6 feet 3 inches tall, Mr. Trump had a body mass index of 30.4. Anything over 30 is considered obese. While there is no requirement for presidents to publicly release their medical records, many have over the years as a reassurance that they are up to the rigors of the job. Mr. Trump, the oldest president to ever take office, had been taking rosuvastatin, a lipid-lowering drug, daily to control his cholesterol, according to a memo describing some of his previous physical results. At the time, the president\u2019s cholesterol was elevated, at 196, with an LDL measurement of 122 and an HDL level of 58. ",

      "author": "Annie Karni",
      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 During her two years serving in the Trump administration, Nikki R. Haley, the former ambassador to the United Nations, managed to toe a tougher line on Russia than her boss, while also never straying from his good graces. \u201cWe don\u2019t trust Russia. We don\u2019t trust Putin,\u201d Ms. Haley said in an interview in July 2018, days after Mr. Trump met with the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, in Helsinki, Finland. \u201cThey\u2019re never going to be our friend.\u201d By the time Ms. Haley left the administration nearly a year ago, she seemed to have perfected an almost impossible dance: distancing herself from some of the president\u2019s most criticized positions while staying publicly loyal. She managed to leave both on her terms and on good terms with the president. It was a balancing act that did not go without notice, and Ms. Haley, a woman of color and a former governor of South Carolina, was widely seen as preserving her options for a return to politics, perhaps as a post-Trump presidential candidate. Last summer, she challenged the president once more after he had trumpeted the fact that the Baltimore home of Representative Elijah E. Cummings, a critic of Mr. Trump, had been broken into. \u201cThis is so unnecessary,\u201d Ms. Haley wrote on Twitter in August, infuriating the president, according to aides. But now, Ms. Haley appears to have made the political calculation to go all in supporting the president, rather than defining herself in contrast to him. In a media blitz timed to the release of her new book, \u201cWith All Due Respect: Defending America With Grit and Grace,\u201d Ms. Haley has consistently echoed White House talking points about how there is no case for impeachment and unequivocally defended Mr. Trump\u2019s character. \u201cIn every instance I dealt with him, he was truthful, he listened and he was great to work with,\u201d Ms. Haley told NBC\u2019s Savannah Guthrie. In her book, Ms. Haley does not criticize the president, but does take on two targets who have fallen out of favor with him, and with whom she clashed repeatedly: John F. Kelly, the former chief of staff, and Rex Tillerson, the former secretary of state. She praises the president as a leader who always treated her with respect and describes an honest relationship in which he would sometimes change course based on her counsel. In describing the announcement of her resignation in October 2018, when Mr. Trump praised her for her service, she writes that the president was \u201cthe man I\u2019d seen many times, the man he too often doesn\u2019t let the country see.\u201d She even tries to explain his continuing flattery of Mr. Putin, describing a conversation with him after the Helsinki meeting. \u201cTo his credit,\u201d she writes, \u201cthe president soon issued additional remarks, saying he had misspoken.\u201d She adds: \u201cI was glad he made that clarification, and I understood what he had been trying to do. He was trying to keep communication open with Putin.\u201d She also credits Mr. Trump with learning from the experience of Charlottesville, and handling synagogue shootings in Pittsburgh and near San Diego \u201cwith great sensitivity and appropriateness.\u201d Ms. Haley\u2019s loyalty to Mr. Trump\u2019s view of the world has been rewarded with a presidential endorsement. \u201cMake sure you order your copy today, or stop by one of her book tour stops to get a copy and say hello. Good luck Nikki!\u201d Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. For Ms. Haley, an Indian-American Tea Party activist who became a two-term governor of South Carolina known better as a voice of moderation on racial issues in the South, the reaction to her tweet about Mr. Cummings was a rude reminder of how she risks losing the Trump base when she puts distance between herself and the president. Mr. Trump, aides said, wanted to respond to her himself, but was talked out of doing it. Instead, Kellyanne Conway, a top adviser who is close with Vice President Mike Pence, shot back at Ms. Haley in a tweet that was sanctioned from the top. \u201cTHIS is so unnecessary Trump-PENCE2020,\u201d Ms. Conway wrote, an allusion to the rumors that Ms. Haley had been positioning herself to replace Mr. Pence on the ticket in 2020. Ms. Haley remains close with the president\u2019s daughter Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner, and they warned her to be more careful talking about Mr. Trump, according to two people familiar with the conversation. A spokeswoman for Ms. Haley said she never received such a warning. Her subsequent pivot can be seen as a recognition of the reality confronting anyone contemplating a future in today\u2019s Republican Party \u2014 there is little future after distancing yourself from Mr. Trump. \u201cIt is Trump\u2019s party today and, more likely than not, it will be Trump\u2019s party 10 years from now,\u201d said Kevin Madden, a political strategist and former adviser to Mitt Romney\u2019s presidential campaign. \u201cTrump will cast a long shadow over the party\u2019s profile and will be a litmus test for the party\u2019s most active base voters for years to come.\u201d For Republicans like Ms. Haley, Mr. Madden said the relationship with Trumpism would continue to be a balancing act. \u201cStray too far and you run the risk of inviting scorn from his biggest defenders,\u201d he said. \u201cGo lock step with him and, as we\u2019ve seen with the 2018 midterm test and the 2019 contests in key states like Virginia, the potential is there to alienate voters in suburbs who are making and breaking elections right now.\u201d Ms. Haley has been relatively removed from public life in the year since she left the administration. She joined the board of Boeing and is reportedly getting paid $200,000 a speech on the speaking tour. But her forays into politics show someone who is tacking toward Mr. Trump, while leaving herself room for daylight between them in the future. She has held a fund-raiser for the president and plans to do more, according to an aide. Ms. Haley, who still lives in New York City but plans to return to South Carolina after her son graduates from high school, has also started a nonprofit organization called Stand for America. The group\u2019s website describes America\u2019s prosperity being threatened by \u201csocialist schemes\u201d of higher taxes, regulations and \u201cunsecure borders,\u201d echoing the language and themes of Mr. Trump\u2019s own re-election campaign. She has campaigned for Republicans like Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa and Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado. But she also appears to be stirring the pot on Twitter in a way that is intended to grab Mr. Trump\u2019s attention and stay in the news. On Monday, she targeted George T. Conway III, the outspoken, Trump-hating husband of Ms. Conway, who has drawn the president\u2019s own ire. \u201cGeorge Conway is the last person that can call someone \u2018trash\u2019. #Pathetic,\u201d Ms. Haley wrote on Twitter, criticizing Mr. Conway for an attack on Representative Elise Stefanik, Republican of New York, who emerged during the first week of televised impeachment hearings as a moderate turned Trump defender. \u201cYou\u2019ll say anything to get the vice-presidential nomination, won\u2019t you?\u201d Mr. Conway fired back. Ms. Haley, who declined to comment for this article, has in the past denied that she is seeking to replace Mr. Pence. But White House advisers loyal to Mr. Pence have long faulted Ms. Haley for stoking the rumors that she could potentially replace Mr. Pence on the 2020 ticket \u2014 something they see as beneficial to an out-of-office politician who needs a way to stay relevant until the next presidential race. Some have noted with frustration that it was Mr. Pence who first advocated Ms. Haley joining the administration, even though she had been tacitly critical of Mr. Trump during her 2016 response to President Barack Obama\u2019s final State of the Union address and had supported Senator Marco Rubio of Florida during the 2016 Republican primary. For now, friends said, with plenty of time for another pivot down the line, supporting Mr. Trump makes sense. \u201cHaving that tweet from Donald Trump is going to be very, very important, promoting the book,\u201d said Bakari Sellers, the former South Carolina state legislator who ran unsuccessfully for lieutenant governor and is now a CNN commentator. \u201cShe got what she wanted.\u201d Mr. Sellers, a Democrat who said he considered Ms. Haley a friend, said that in her balancing act he saw someone who had plenty of time to recalibrate. Ms. Haley, he predicted, would have a longer political story to tell. \u201cDonald Trump is going to be a footnote in her political career,\u201d Mr. Sellers predicted. \u201cIt won\u2019t be defining.\u201d",

Mueller III.By Charlie SavagePRINT EDITIONHouse Striving To See if Trump Lied to Mueller|November 19, 2019, Page A1",
      "author": "Charlie Savage",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 House Democrats are exploring whether President Trump lied in his written answers to Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation, a lawyer for the House told a federal appeals court on Monday, raising the prospect of an additional basis for an article of impeachment. The acknowledgment refocused attention on a quiet debate among Democrats about whether any impeachment of Mr. Trump should go beyond the Ukraine affair and also accuse him of obstructing the Russia investigation. Additional evidence, hidden in grand jury files, that Mr. Trump may have lied under oath to Mr. Mueller could bolster the case for an additional article of impeachment, Democratic aides said. The House lawyer\u2019s statement was also striking because it came shortly after Mr. Trump said he may also be willing to provide written answers about the Ukraine matter to impeachment investigators. \u201cEven though I did nothing wrong, and don\u2019t like giving credibility to this No Due Process Hoax, I like the idea & will, in order to get Congress focused again, strongly consider it!\u201d Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. His statement and the hearing, in a case over the House\u2019s attempt to gain access to secret grand jury evidence gathered by Mr. Mueller, came as witnesses and lawmakers jostled for leverage before a new round of impeachment hearings scheduled to begin on Tuesday. Kurt D. Volker, the former special envoy to Ukraine who will appear before lawmakers on Tuesday, planned to testify that he was out of the loop at key moments during Mr. Trump\u2019s pressure campaign on Ukraine, according to an account of his prepared testimony. Democrats conducting the inquiry added to their witness list an official at the American Embassy in Kyiv, David Holmes, who testified privately that he overheard Mr. Trump ask a top diplomat if Ukraine would move forward with investigations he sought. They also released transcripts of depositions by Mr. Holmes and David Hale, the under secretary of state for political affairs, that offered more details about the effort by Trump loyalists to pressure Ukraine for the investigations. And House Republicans wrote to Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, who attended the inauguration of Ukraine\u2019s president this year, asking him to provide \u201cany firsthand information you have about President Trump\u2019s actions toward Ukraine.\u201d But the court hearing heightened attention on House Democrats\u2019 longstanding suspicions about Mr. Trump\u2019s responses to questions in the Russia investigation. The hearing centered on a Federal District Court\u2019s ruling last month that the House should be given access to secret grand jury evidence from the Mueller investigation immediately, and whether enforcement of that ruling should be stayed while the Justice Department\u2019s appeal is fully litigated. Later on Monday, the appellate panel decided to keep a stay of the lower-court ruling in place \u201cpending further order of the court,\u201d while issuing an expedited briefing schedule with arguments set for Jan. 3. If the judiciary keeps the stay in place \u2014 including for the likely appeals \u2014 House Democrats appear unlikely to receive the grand jury evidence before they decide whether to move forward with an impeachment vote. Still, the argument underscored that they already have evidence calling into question the honesty of Mr. Trump\u2019s responses from the Mueller report and the recently concluded trial of Mr. Trump\u2019s longtime friend and informal adviser Roger J. Stone Jr. Mr. Trump had refused to let the special counsel\u2019s office interview him. But in his written responses, which were appended to the Mueller report, he denied that he was aware of any communications between his campaign and WikiLeaks. House lawyers had suggested in a Sept. 30 filing that some of the materials they were seeking bore in on whether Mr. Trump lied about that subject. And on Monday, Douglas Letter, the general counsel for the House, told a federal appeals court panel that impeachment investigators had an \u201cimmense\u201d need to swiftly see the grand jury evidence \u2014 redacted portions of the Mueller report, as well as the underlying testimony transcripts they came from. \u201cWas the president not truthful in his responses to the Mueller investigation?\u201d Mr. Letter said, adding, \u201cI believe the special counsel said the president had been untruthful in some of his answers.\u201d He was referring to congressional testimony in July when Mr. Mueller agreed with a lawmaker\u2019s assertion that the president\u2019s written responses \u201cshowed that he wasn\u2019t always being truthful.\u201d Both the lawmaker in July and Mr. Letter on Monday were referring in particular to the question of whether Mr. Trump lied about his campaign\u2019s advance knowledge of and contacts with WikiLeaks about its possession of hacked Democratic emails and plans to publish them. Mr. Trump wrote that he was \u201cnot aware during the campaign of any communications\u201d between \u201cany one I understood to be a representative of WikiLeaks\u201d and people associated with his campaign. Mr. Stone was convicted last week of lying to congressional investigators about his efforts to reach out to WikiLeaks and his discussions with the campaign. \u201cI do not recall discussing WikiLeaks with him,\u201d Mr. Trump also wrote of Mr. Stone, \u201cnor do I recall being aware of Mr. Stone having discussed WikiLeaks with individuals associated with my campaign.\u201d But the publicly available portions of the Mueller report suggest that evidence exists to the contrary. Several Trump aides, including Michael D. Cohen and Rick Gates, testified that they heard Mr. Trump discussing coming WikiLeaks releases over the phone. And in October 2016 Stephen K. Bannon, the campaign chairman, wrote in an email that Mr. Stone had told the campaign \u201cabout potential future releases of damaging material\u201d by WikiLeaks shortly before it began publishing more hacked emails. Mr. Letter brought up redactions in the report associated with Mr. Stone and a redacted reference to an assertion by Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, to a grand jury. \u201cManafort said that shortly after WikiLeaks\u2019 July 22, 2016, released of hacked documents, he spoke to Trump [redacted]; Manafort recalled that Trump responded that Manafort should [redacted] keep Trump updated,\u201d the Mueller report said, citing grand jury material as the reason for the redactions. The report went on to suggest that House investigators may see Mr. Manafort\u2019s grand jury testimony as potentially corroborating Mr. Gates\u2019s account of Mr. Trump\u2019s conversation with Mr. Stone about WikiLeaks. \u201cDeputy campaign manager Rick Gates said that Manafort was getting pressure about [redacted] information and that Manafort instructed Gates [redacted] status updates on upcoming releases,\u201d the report said, citing an F.B.I. interview with Mr. Gates. Mr. Letter told the court, \u201cThe Manafort situation shows so clearly that there is evidence, very sadly, that the president might have provided untruthful answers,\u201d and added that it \u201cmight be part of an impeachment inquiry.\u201d The Mueller report cited additional evidence from Mr. Gates that Mr. Trump did have discussions about the content or timing of the future release of hacked emails. For example, Mr. Gates also told investigators that about that same time, he was with Mr. Trump in a car to an airport when Mr. Trump received a call. After something that is redacted in the public version of the report, it recounts that after Mr. Trump hung up, he told Mr. Gates \u201cthat more releases of damaging information would be coming,\u201d the report said. Attorney General William P. Barr permitted the House Judiciary Committee to see most of the Mueller report, including portions that are redacted from the public version because they pertained to continuing cases, but he has refused to let it see material that is subject to secrecy rules because it was presented to a grand jury. In July, House lawmakers petitioned the chief judge of the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia, Beryl A. Howell, for an order allowing them to gain access to that material too. Their court filings in that matter were the first time that the House formally pronounced itself engaged in an impeachment inquiry; there is precedent, including in Watergate, permitting the House to get grand jury information for impeachment proceedings. Judge Howell ruled in October that the Judiciary Committee should be permitted to see the grand jury material in the report and its underlying basis. But the Justice Department appealed that ruling, arguing that the Watergate precedent was wrong and Congress had no right to see grand jury evidence even for impeachment purposes. The appeals court panel includes Judge Neomi Rao, a former Trump White House official whom he recently appointed to the bench; Judge Judith W. Rogers, a 1994 appointee of President Bill Clinton; and Thomas B. Griffith, a 2005 appointee of President George W. Bush.",

SchmidtPRINT EDITION\u2018We Followed the President\u2019s Orders\u2019|November 21, 2019, Page A1",
      "author": "Nicholas Fandos",
      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 An ambassador at the center of the House impeachment inquiry testified on Wednesday that he was following President Trump\u2019s orders, with the full knowledge of other top administration officials, when he pressured the Ukrainians to conduct investigations into Mr. Trump\u2019s political rivals in what he called a clear \u201cquid pro quo.\u201d Gordon D. Sondland, Mr. Trump\u2019s envoy to the European Union, told the House Intelligence Committee that he reluctantly followed Mr. Trump\u2019s directive. He testified that the president instructed him to work with Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, as he pressured Ukraine to publicly commit to investigating former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and an unsubstantiated theory that Democrats conspired with Kyiv to interfere in the 2016 election. \u201cWe followed the president\u2019s orders,\u201d Mr. Sondland said. His appearance amounted to an act of defiance by an official who has been described by other witnesses as a point man in the push to extract the investigations. In his testimony, Mr. Sondland linked the most senior members of the Trump administration to the effort \u2014 including the vice president, the secretary of state, the acting chief of staff and others. He said they were informed of it at key moments, an account that severely undercut Mr. Trump\u2019s frequent claims that he never pressured Ukraine. Instead, Mr. Sondland, a wealthy Republican megadonor, described an expansive effort to help the president do just that. Later on Wednesday, a Defense Department official, Laura K. Cooper, testified that Ukrainian officials may have known as early as late July that a $391 million package of security assistance was being withheld by the Trump administration. The testimony by Ms. Cooper called into question another central element of the president\u2019s defense: that there was no pressure because Ukrainian officials were unaware that the money was frozen. Two months into the investigation, Mr. Sondland\u2019s account came as close as investigators have gotten to an admission from an official who dealt directly with Mr. Trump. But Mr. Sondland\u2019s accounts have shifted since the committee first deposed him in October, opening him up to Republican criticism that he is not credible. Mr. Sondland has repeatedly claimed not to have recalled key episodes, and he conceded during testimony on Wednesday that he did not record precisely what had happened. He blamed the State Department for not providing him with all his emails, call logs and other records. Still, he offered revelations and had the evidence to corroborate them. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo signed off on parts of the pressure campaign, Mr. Sondland testified, and Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, was deeply involved. They understood, as he did, that there was a quid pro quo linking a White House meeting for President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to a promise by him to announce investigations into Mr. Trump\u2019s political rivals, he said. \u201cI know that members of this committee have frequently framed these complicated issues in the form of a simple question: Was there a quid pro quo?\u201d Mr. Sondland said. \u201cAs I testified previously, with regard to the requested White House call and White House meeting, the answer is yes.\u201d \u201cEveryone was in the loop,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was no secret.\u201d Mr. Sondland testified that he came to believe that Mr. Trump was also linking congressionally approved military assistance to Ukraine with a public commitment by Mr. Zelensky to investigate Mr. Trump\u2019s political adversaries. Mr. Sondland said he informed Vice President Mike Pence of his concern about that connection during a Sept. 1 meeting in Warsaw. Ms. Cooper testified that Ukrainian officials had reached out to the State and Defense Departments with questions about the status of the military funding on July 25, only hours after Mr. Trump pressed Mr. Zelensky during a phone call for the investigations. Republicans have insisted that Ukraine did not know that the aid had been held up until it was reported in the news media in late August. Beyond the evolving timeline, Mr. Sondland\u2019s testimony raised questions about whether the other top administration figures he mentioned \u2014 including Mr. Pompeo, Mr. Mulvaney and John R. Bolton, the president\u2019s former national security adviser \u2014 would come forward to testify. The Trump administration tried to block the testimony of Mr. Sondland, Ms. Cooper and David Hale, the No. 3 State Department official, who also appeared on Wednesday, and refused to allow Mr. Sondland access to certain documents, he said, which it also withheld from the committee despite a subpoena. Democrats pointed to the administration\u2019s stonewalling as yet another piece of evidence for an impeachment article against Mr. Trump for obstruction of Congress. \u201cIt goes right to the heart of the issue of bribery, as well as other potential high crimes and misdemeanors,\u201d Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, told reporters during a brief break in the hearing. Republicans, moving to discredit Mr. Sondland, seized on his assertion that Mr. Trump never personally or explicitly told him about conditions on the White House meeting or the security assistance. Mr. Sondland said under questioning that he came to the conclusion on his own. Representative Michael R. Turner, Republican of Ohio, hammered on the point, his voice rising as he sharply questioned the ambassador. \u201cNo one told you? Not just the president \u2014 Giuliani didn\u2019t tell you, Mulvaney didn\u2019t tell you, nobody?\u201d Mr. Turner demanded. \u201cPompeo didn\u2019t tell you? \u201cNo one on this planet told you that President Trump was tying aid to investigations,\u201d he added. \u201cYes or no?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d Mr. Sondland responded. The ambassador, who smiled often during his appearance and cheerfully admitted to a flair for colorful language and frequent use of \u201cfour-letter words\u201d in his conversations with Mr. Trump, appeared to relish pulling other top officials into the spotlight. For weeks, Republicans had cast him as a rogue actor. \u201cThe suggestion that we were engaged in some irregular or rogue diplomacy is absolutely false,\u201d he said, pointing to messages and phone calls in which he kept the White House and the State Department informed of his actions. Some of the senior officials who figured prominently in Mr. Sondland\u2019s testimony quickly challenged his account, and Mr. Trump tried to distance himself from the ambassador. \u201cI don\u2019t know him very well \u2014 I have not spoken to him much,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters before leaving for Texas on Wednesday afternoon. Holding a page of notes scrawled in marker in large block letters, Mr. Trump quoted Mr. Sondland\u2019s closed-door deposition in which the ambassador described a phone call in which the president had told him he did not want a quid pro quo. Before boarding Marine One, Mr. Trump shouted, \u201cThis is the final word from the president of the United States.\u201d The White House press secretary later put out a statement saying that Mr. Sondland\u2019s testimony \u201ccompletely exonerates President Trump of any wrongdoing.\u201d Through an aide, Mr. Pence denied that the two men had spoken one-on-one. \u201cThere was never a time when Sondland was alone with the vice president in Warsaw, and if he\u2019s recalling the pre-briefing, I was in that, and he never said anything in that venue either,\u201d said Marc Short, Mr. Pence\u2019s chief of staff. Defying the State Department\u2019s wishes, Mr. Sondland shared previously unseen emails and texts that demonstrated how he kept Mr. Pompeo and other administration officials apprised of his efforts to push the Ukranians. In one of them, Mr. Sondland tells Mr. Pompeo about a draft statement in which the Ukranians would commit to the investigations, and about a plan to have Mr. Zelensky speak directly with Mr. Trump about the matter. \u201cThe contents will hopefully make the boss happy enough to authorize an invitation,\u201d Mr. Sondland wrote in an email to Mr. Pompeo. A week and a half later, Mr. Sondland sent Mr. Pompeo another email asking whether he should arrange a meeting in Warsaw for Mr. Trump where Mr. Zelensky would \u201clook him in the eye\u201d and promise him the investigations, breaking a \u201clogjam.\u201d Mr. Pompeo issued a statement that appeared intended to deny Mr. Sondland\u2019s testimony, but that did not directly address the ambassador\u2019s assertion that the secretary of state knew and approved of his efforts. \u201cGordon Sondland never told Secretary Pompeo that he believed the president was linking aid to investigations of political opponents,\u201d according to the statement from Morgan Ortagus, the State Department spokeswoman. Mr. Sondland even took shots at Mr. Bolton, who other witnesses have said harbored deep concerns over the ambassador\u2019s actions and repeatedly instructed subordinates to report them to White House lawyers. \u201cCuriously \u2014 and this was very interesting to me \u2014 on Aug. 26, shortly before his visit to Kyiv, Ambassador Bolton\u2019s office requested Mr. Giuliani\u2019s contact information from me,\u201d said Mr. Sondland, who repeated himself and then paused to smirk before continuing with his testimony. One of the more dramatic moments of the day occurred in the final hour in an exchange between Mr. Sondland and Representative Sean Patrick Maloney, Democrat of New York, who elicited a grudging admission from the ambassador that the investigations that Mr. Trump wanted would benefit him politically. \u201cSee? It didn\u2019t hurt a bit,\u201d Mr. Maloney said, drawing a testy response from Mr. Sondland, who said he was trying to be \u201cforthright.\u201d \u201cIt didn\u2019t work so well the first time, did it?\u201d Mr. Maloney shot back, referring to the multiple changes Mr. Sondland has made to his story. \u201cWe appreciate your candor,\u201d Mr. Maloney said, \u201cbut let\u2019s be really clear on what it took to get it out of you.\u201d",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Republicans mounted an array of defenses of President Trump at this week\u2019s impeachment hearings \u2014 making arguments that at times seemed to conflict with one another logically, but that dovetailed in a key way: All served to undermine Democrats\u2019 allegations that Mr. Trump abused his power. In angry statements from the hearing dais, lines of questioning to witnesses and comments during breaks to reporters, Republicans sought to poke holes in the strength of evidence that Mr. Trump personally put a condition on the government committing official acts \u2014 namely, that Ukraine publicize investigations that could benefit him. But at other times, Republicans suggested that Mr. Trump\u2019s pursuit of those investigations was justified \u2014 reading into the record related facts and allegations about Ukrainian actions in 2016 and about the Ukrainian gas company Burisma and its decision to give Hunter Biden, the son of Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., a lucrative board seat. Republicans\u2019 tactics seemed geared to play to different audiences \u2014 independent voters, hard-core Trump supporters and the president himself. The approach underscored a political asymmetry about the proceedings: The Democrats are trying to paint a coherent picture, while Republicans need only muddy it \u2014 and they have lots of ways to do so. Indeed, at still other times, Republicans dismissed the entire impeachment inquiry as a witch hunt and tried to associate it with the fact that the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, found insufficient evidence of any criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia\u2019s 2016 election manipulation operation. [Here\u2019s background on David Holmes, a United States Embassy official testifying on Thursday.] \u201cYou have to keep that history in mind as you consider the Democrats\u2019 latest catalog of supposed Trump outrages,\u201d the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, Representative Devin Nunes of California, said on Wednesday. The Republicans sharpened their counterarguments and defenses as Gordon D. Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union, delivered damaging testimony about what he witnessed as one of the Trump proxies orbiting Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, as they pushed Ukraine to announce the investigations. Mr. Sondland said there was a clear quid pro quo that attached a condition \u2014 a public announcement of the investigations \u2014 to a potential official action by Mr. Trump, inviting President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to the White House. But Mr. Sondland said no one told him that Mr. Trump was also holding up a package of military aid to Ukraine for the same purpose, though he assumed that was the explanation. In opening questioning to Mr. Sondland, Mr. Nunes seemed to make the case that Mr. Trump had good reason to seek investigations. He asked Mr. Sondland whether he was aware of a series of facts and various allegations about Hunter Biden and Burisma, and about Ukrainians who expressed support for Hillary Clinton or opposition to Mr. Trump. \u201cSo knowing all these facts from high-ranking Ukrainian officials, ambassador, it probably makes a little more sense now as to why the president may think that there\u2019s problems with Ukraine and that Ukraine was out to get him?\u201d Mr. Nunes asked Mr. Sondland. \u201cI understand your \u2014 I understand your point, yes, Mr. Chairman,\u201d Mr. Sondland replied. But if the premise of Mr. Nunes\u2019s line of questioning was that it was righteous to seek the investigations, a line of questioning that followed, by the Republicans\u2019 top staff lawyer, Stephen R. Castor, pointed to a different conclusion: The important point was that there was no clear proof that Mr. Trump himself was behind the pressure. Mr. Castor marched Mr. Sondland through a lengthy series of questions to emphasize the point that Mr. Trump never personally told him there was any quid pro quo \u2014 highlighting that Mr. Sondland had no clear proof that the president was personally orchestrating anything untoward. \u201cSo the president never told you about any preconditions for aid to be released?\u201d Mr. Castor asked. \u201cNo,\u201d Mr. Sondland replied. \u201cThe president never told you about preconditions for a White House meeting?\u201d Mr. Castor followed up. \u201cPersonally, no,\u201d Mr. Sondland said. Mr. Sondland said his understanding that Mr. Trump was offering a White House meeting to Mr. Zelensky on the condition that he announce investigations was based on what Mr. Giuliani told him. Pressed on how he could know that, Mr. Sondland replied that Mr. Trump had directed him to talk to Mr. Giuliani about the matter. Other Republican lawmakers including, Elise Stefanik of New York, repeated Mr. Castor\u2019s line of questioning and its implication that no direct evidence of Mr. Trump\u2019s motivations had emerged. Left unsaid was that Mr. Trump was keeping other potential witnesses whom he spoke to about Ukraine from testifying \u2014 including Mr. Giuliani; his former national security adviser, John R. Bolton, who was opposed to blocking the aid and met one on one with Mr. Trump about it in August; and his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, who relayed the order to block the aid to the bureaucracy. Later in the hearing, Representative Adam B. Schiff, the California Democrat who leads the Intelligence Committee, pushed back against any suggestion that Mr. Trump\u2019s proxies were carrying out a rogue Ukraine policy. \u201cI do not believe that the president would allow himself to be led by the nose by Rudy Giuliani or Ambassador Sondland or anybody else,\u201d Mr. Schiff asserted. \u201cI think the president was the one who decided whether a meeting would happen, whether aid would be lifted, not anyone who worked for him.\u201d Several Republicans pushed Mr. Sondland to reiterate his account of a conversation he had with Mr. Trump on Sept. 9. Mr. Sondland recounted that he directly asked Mr. Trump what he wanted from Ukraine, and the president, in a surly mood, responded that he wanted \u201cnothing\u201d from Mr. Zelensky, wanted no quid pro quo, and only wanted Mr. Zelensky to do \u201cthe right thing\u201d that he had run for office on \u2014 apparently a reference to fighting corruption. On Sept. 11, two days after that conversation, Mr. Trump finally released the aid to Ukraine. Because Mr. Zelensky had not announced any investigations, defenders of Mr. Trump have said that means there was no quid pro quo. Critics have responded that Mr. Trump released the security assistance only after he learned that a whistle-blower was trying to tell Congress that the president was using his official powers to force Ukraine to do something for his own personal benefit, noting that someone who gets caught trying to commit a crime is still guilty even if the plot is discovered and thwarted. But Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio and a fierce defender of Mr. Trump, tried that argument again on Wednesday. He thunderously demanded that Mr. Sondland tell him when Mr. Zelensky made an announcement of investigations as part of the quid pro quo, leading Mr. Sondland to reply that it never happened. \u201cThey didn\u2019t have to do anything,\u201d Mr. Jordan said in disgust. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this.\u201d",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 In honoring the actor Jon Voight, an outspoken Trump supporter, with the National Medal of the Arts on Thursday, President Trump described him as \u201csomebody I happen to really like.\u201d In introducing the author James Patterson as a recipient of the National Humanities Medal, Mr. Trump called him \u201canother friend of mine,\u201d although he failed to mention that Mr. Patterson was also a dues-paying member of his Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Fla. The Claremont Institute, a conservative think tank whose alumni have gone on to serve in the Trump administration, also received a humanities award. And in his remarks about Sharon Percy Rockefeller, a longtime advocate for public broadcasting and the former president and chief executive of WETA in the Washington area, who was also chosen as an arts medal recipient, Mr. Trump joked that \u201cmaybe I\u2019ll start getting good publicity\u201d from shows like \u201cPBS NewsHour\u201d and \u201cWashington Week.\u201d \u201cThey tend to be on the other side of things, a little bit,\u201d he added. \u201cI think now I have a better chance.\u201d Throughout a brief and relatively sedate ceremony in the East Room presenting medals celebrating the arts and humanities for the first time since he assumed office, the president made it clear that his own relationship to the artists or patrons of the arts, and their support for him, were front of mind as much as their collective contributions to society. The pattern was a familiar one. In the past, Mr. Trump has also used the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation\u2019s highest civilian honor, to celebrate friends and business partners like Tiger Woods. Other recipients on Thursday like the chef Patrick J. O\u2019Connell; Teresa Lozano Long, a philanthropist based in Austin, Texas; and the bluegrass musician and singer Alison Krauss had no clear links to the president. But since the 1980s, when the United States began recognizing its greatest artists with the national medals, recipients have always been handpicked by the president, with input from members of the National Council on the Arts, and reflected their tastes if not their political affiliations. Past recipients have included Georgia O\u2019Keeffe, Frank Capra and Ella Fitzgerald. President Barack Obama\u2019s list of recipients in 2016 included Berry Gordy, the founder of Motown Records; the composer Philip Glass; the authors Sandra Cisneros and Ron Chernow; the poet Louise Gl\u00fcck; and the chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s. Mr. Trump has presided over the longest gap in history during which none of the medals were given out, at all, a drought that came as Mr. Trump released budgets that sought to eliminate two agencies that support the arts, the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities. In past years, presidents typically selected about a dozen recipients for each medal. Last week, the White House announced that Mr. Trump had chosen just eight recipients in total for both awards. Arts advocates said they were simply happy to see any artist, or patron of the arts, honored at the White House, even if there were fewer of them and the crowd lacked diversity. \u201cEvery president picks their own list of people, and we are just happy to see the arts be honored,\u201d said Robert L. Lynch, the president of Americans for the Arts, a national lobbying group. \u201cThe medal is not about Trump. The medal is about America, and about our government honoring artists and humanists as something that is important to our country.\u201d But other members of the creative community were less open-minded about what it meant to receive a medal celebrating the arts from Mr. Trump. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that the deficit in empathy and humanity that the president displays would make getting an award from him an awkward predicament,\u201d said Leon Botstein, a conductor and the president of Bard College. \u201cOne wants the nation to honor its artists, but on the other hand it\u2019s an embarrassment given the values he stands for.\u201d In receiving her award, Ms. Krauss, who has won more Grammy Awards than any other female musician, seemed to embody the tension. She appeared to be polite to Mr. Trump, but also at times seemed to avoid his gaze. \u201cLook how shy she is,\u201d Mr. Trump said. In the past, nominations came in from the public and from members of the National Council on the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities. Those recommendations were passed onto the president, who would make the final decision. The process was always somewhat political, with presidents ultimately choosing recipients who fit their own agendas. A spokeswoman for the National Endowment for the Arts said that the process this year was run according to the federal regulations that guide that process. But she would not say whether any of Mr. Trump\u2019s selections were from the list of people who had been recommended to him. A White House spokesman added that the staff secretary had also solicited nominees from cabinet officials and senior White House staff members.",

      "author": "Linda Qiu",
      "content": " In a freewheeling 53-minute interview on Friday morning on Fox News, President Trump rattled off exaggerations, falsehoods and debunked conspiracy theories, often related to the impeachment inquiry. Many of them have previously been fact-checked by The New York Times and found false, including his claim that Ukraine, rather than Russia, was behind the hacking of the Democratic National Committee in 2016; his accusation that the Obama administration wiretapped him; and his characterization of the whistle-blower\u2019s report as baseless. Here\u2019s a check of some of his newer assertions. \u201cHe made up a phone call, and then when I released it, everybody was embarrassed.\u201d False. Mr. Trump was referring to statements Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, made about the president\u2019s July 25 phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. But Mr. Trump\u2019s timeline is scrambled. A day after Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the impeachment inquiry on Sept. 24, the White House released the reconstructed transcript of Mr. Trump\u2019s call with Mr. Zelensky. The following day, Mr. Schiff opened a congressional hearing with a characterization of the transcript. He did not claim to be reciting from the White House transcript, but said he was conferring \u201cthe essence\u201d of the conversation, \u201cshorn of its rambling character and in not so many words.\u201d So Mr. Schiff\u2019s account of the call came after Mr. Trump released the reconstructed transcript, not before, and while Mr. Schiff took some liberties in the way he recounted the July 25 call, his characterization generally stuck to the actual substance of the conversation. Mr. Trump has at other times acknowledged that Mr. Schiff\u2019s account of the call came after the release of the transcript. At a campaign rally in October, he said Mr. Schiff \u201chad to make up a fake conversation\u201d because the transcript of the actual call was \u201cso good.\u201d \u201cI know Ukrainian people. They\u2019re great people. But it\u2019s known as being the third most corrupt country in the world.\u201d This is exaggerated. Mr. Trump has often claimed that he withheld military aid to Ukraine because he was concerned about corruption. The statistic he offered to prove this point, however, is not quite accurate. Transparency International ranked Ukraine at No. 120 out of 180 countries in its 2018 Corruption Perceptions Index, which is based on 13 global data sources on development. Ukraine also ranked at No. 120 in 2017, but its score improved by two points. (The three most corrupt countries in 2018 were Somalia, Syria and South Sudan. Seven countries in Eastern Europe and Central Asia had lower rankings than Ukraine.) Mr. Trump\u2019s insistence that he was focused on corruption also lacks support. For one, he did not raise those concerns during his July 25 call with Mr. Zelensky or in an April 21 call. The Pentagon had also certified in May that Ukraine had \u201ctaken substantive actions\u201d to root out corruption. The military aid to Ukraine was withheld in July and released on Sept. 11, but neither Mr. Trump nor his aides have specified what corruption improvements had been made in Kyiv in those two months. \u201cHow about the guy with the telephone? How about that one? I guarantee you that never took place.\u201d This is disputed. David Holmes, the political counselor at the United States Embassy in Ukraine, testified on Thursday that he had overheard a cellphone call between Mr. Trump and Gordon D. Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union, in July. During the call, Mr. Holmes said, Mr. Trump had asked Mr. Sondland about Ukrainian investigations into his political rivals. Mr. Holmes testified that he provided an account of the call to his boss immediately afterward and also informed other colleagues at the embassy in Kyiv. Though Mr. Trump insisted Mr. Holmes\u2019s account was wrong, Mr. Sondland said Wednesday in congressional testimony that he had \u201cno reason\u201d to doubt it, though he could not recall precise details of their conversation. \u201cIt\u2019s true that the president speaks loudly at times, and it\u2019s also true \u2014 I think we primarily discussed ASAP Rocky,\u201d Mr. Sondland said, referring to the American rapper who was charged with assault in Sweden around that time. \u201cActually, actually, I would have been more surprised if President Trump had not mentioned investigations, particularly given what we were hearing from Mr. Giuliani about the president\u2019s concerns,\u201d he said, referring to Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer. \u201cHowever, I have no recollection of discussing Vice President Biden or his son on that call or after the call ended.\u201d \u201cThis was an Obama person. Wouldn\u2019t \u2014 didn\u2019t want to hang my picture in the embassy.\u201d This lacks evidence. The president was referring to Marie L. Yovanovitch, a career diplomat who served as the United States ambassador to Ukraine until he recalled her this spring. She had come under intense criticism from allies of Mr. Trump, including Mr. Giuliani and Donald Trump Jr., who helped spread accusations that Ms. Yovanovitch was insufficiently loyal to the president. She has become a witness in the impeachment inquiry. Mr. Trump\u2019s remark about his portrait may have been drawn from an exchange between Representative Lee M. Zeldin, Republican of New York, and Mr. Holmes during closed congressional testimony last week. Mr. Zeldin asked Mr. Holmes if it was true that there was no official portrait of Mr. Trump hanging inside the United States Embassy in Kyiv by August 2017. Mr. Holmes replied that he could not recall. But the White House did not release the portraits of Mr. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence for distribution in federal facilities until Oct. 31, 2017. Lawyers for Ms. Yovanovitch disputed Mr. Trump\u2019s claim, according to the NBC reporter Geoff Bennett, and said the embassy in Kyiv hung his portrait, along with Mr. Pence\u2019s and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\u2019s, \u201cas soon as they arrived.\u201d Mr. Trump was also wrong to characterize Ms. Yovanovitch as an \u201cObama person.\u201d She has served as an ambassador under presidents of both parties. She was first appointed as an ambassador to Kyrgyzstan and Armenia by President George W. Bush and was sent to Ukraine by President Barack Obama. \u201cNancy Pelosi\u2019s totally incompetent. She\u2019s lost, absolutely lost. She doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019s doing. She hasn\u2019t done anything. She can\u2019t get anything approved.\u201d False. Mr. Trump has a point that the current divided Congress hasn\u2019t exactly been productive compared with years past, but he is wrong to say Speaker Nancy Pelosi has done nothing at all. Congress has enacted 69 pieces of legislation into law since January, and about a dozen since the impeachment inquiry began, including a stopgap spending bill on Thursday. The House, for its part, passed or agreed to 568 bills or resolutions, more than 100 of which were acted upon since the impeachment inquiry began. Ms. Pelosi, in a news conference on Thursday, highlighted a bipartisan resolution supporting pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong that passed both chambers but has not yet been signed by Mr. Trump. She also faulted Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, for failing to take up legislation passed by the House on background checks for gun purchases, anti-domestic violence, immigration and a host of other issues. The White House and Republicans, for their part, have blamed Ms. Pelosi for holding up Mr. Trump\u2019s revised North American trade deal. Top Democrats said they have been making progress in negotiations with the White House, but no deal has yet been reached.

      "author": "Maggie Haberman",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Over four decades in public life, President Trump has sought to bend business, real-estate and political rivals to his will. Facts that cut against his position have been declared false. Witnesses who have questioned his motives have been declared dishonest. Critics of his behavior are part of a corrupt, shadowy effort aiming to damage him. And, as he likes to put it, his own actions are always, to one degree or another, \u201cperfect.\u201d That approach \u2014 which proved effective when Mr. Trump faced off against the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III \u2014 is about to face a formidable test as the impeachment process moves forward. The White House and congressional Republicans allied with Mr. Trump are preparing for a Senate trial in which they will not only declare Mr. Trump\u2019s innocence but also present a version of events that portray him as the victim of a broad plot to undermine his presidency even before it began. That narrative will include claims that Ukrainians meddled in the 2016 election instead of the Russians \u2014 an unfounded allegation refuted by the administration\u2019s own intelligence agencies as recently as this week \u2014 and that Hunter Biden, the younger son of Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., used his father\u2019s connections to make money in Ukraine. In a telephone interview with \u201cFox and Friends\u201d on Friday morning, Mr. Trump listed what he saw as the forces against him \u2014 \u201cthe Democrats and their machine, the media machine, the fake, corrupt media\u201d \u2014 and said he wanted to defend himself against the accusations raised by House Democrats. \u201cFrankly, I want a trial,\u201d Mr. Trump said. Using a blend of blunt force and flattery, along with a mix of false claims interwoven with proven facts to paint himself as a victim, Mr. Trump has worked up a defensive playbook that he honed during the Mueller investigation. In the course of the hearings held the past two weeks by the House Intelligence Committee as part of the impeachment inquiry, his goal was to bulldoze past testimony by an array of witnesses \u2014 including some from his own White House \u2014 who under oath laid out the president\u2019s pressure campaign against the Ukrainian government to investigate, or say it was investigating, the Bidens. To Democrats, the evidence was damning. To White House aides, the fact that the witnesses could not say he was withholding military aid until he got an announcement of a Biden-related investigation was proof that he had done nothing wrong. And rather than dispute each fact said under oath, they focused mostly on process and the handling of the hearing by the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Representative Adam B. Schiff of California. The strategy was similar to the Trump legal team\u2019s handling of the Mueller inquiry, which they frequently charged was not following normal procedures. And when the special counsel\u2019s report did not reveal evidence personally connecting Mr. Trump to the Russian efforts to influence the 2016 election, the president and his advisers seized on it as a \u201ctotal exoneration.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s never a time when he accepts anybody\u2019s judgment over his own,\u201d said Michael D\u2019Antonio, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s biographers. \u201cI think that he does this so well and that it has worked so often that he may not have another message.\u201d \u201cHe once told me that if you stay with a position long enough, there\u2019s a very good chance it would become correct,\u201d Mr. D\u2019Antonio said. As it eventually did with Mr. Mueller, the White House has adopted a defiant posture toward the House Democrats. At the same time, the administration has kept key witnesses \u2014 including the acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and John R. Bolton, the former national security adviser \u2014 from testifying. Mr. Trump has also seized on the allegations against him and turned them on someone else, a familiar tactic. He insisted it was really the Bidens who were linked to corruption in Ukraine and that bad actors there had done him harm by meddling in the 2016 election, a claim intelligence officials have roundly rejected. In the \u201cFox and Friends\u201d interview, Mr. Trump unleashed a torrent of falsehoods to support his claims, including saying that the Obama administration wiretapped his 2016 campaign and asserting that Mr. Schiff \u201cmade up\u201d a phone call of his, when, in fact, the California congressman stated at the time that he was conveying \u201cthe essence\u201d of Mr. Trump\u2019s July 25 call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. Mr. Schiff, Mr. Trump said, was \u201csick,\u201d was part of a broader effort to damage his presidency and should be prosecuted. \u201cThey thought I was going to win, and they said, \u2018How could we stop him?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThey tried to overthrow the presidency. This is a disgrace.\u201d That effort, he said, began even before he became president, adding that an investigation into it would reveal \u201cthe greatest political scandal in the history of our country.\u201d At one point, the hosts Steve Doocy and Brian Kilmeade \u2014 who are reliably friendly to the president \u2014 conveyed a hint of skepticism. \u201cWho is your source, or what are your sources that are telling you, that the Obama administration was out to really hurt your administration?\u201d Mr. Kilmeade asked. Mr. Trump said he could not reveal it. \u201cI can only say that we have a lot of information that a lot of bad things happened,\u201d he said. Asked about the hearings, Mr. Trump flatly denied testimony given under penalty of perjury by a succession of career national security officials. He focused particularly on an account given by David Holmes, a State Department official who said he had overheard a phone call between Mr. Trump and Gordon D. Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union, while he was with Mr. Sondland in Kyiv, Ukraine\u2019s capital. \u201cHow about the guy with the telephone? How about that one?\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI guarantee you that never took place.\u201d \u201cWell, I have really good hearing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve been watching guys for 40 years make phone calls. And I can\u2019t hear when \u2014 you could be two feet away \u2014 I can\u2019t hear people making calls. I can\u2019t hear the other side; the phone\u2019s up in the air. Unless you have it on the speaker phone, you can\u2019t do it. That was a total phony deal.\u201d And he falsely claimed the Democratic National Committee gave its hacked internet server from 2016 to a Ukrainian firm, a debunked conspiracy theory. To ensure support as the impeachment process plays out, Mr. Trump and his aides have spent weeks meeting or speaking individually with dozens of congressional Republicans, at times hosting them at Camp David and for lunch at the White House. At one White House visit recently, he hosted several lawmakers for a screening of the movie \u201cJoker.\u201d The efforts were prompted in part at the urging of Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, and they have targeted even Trump critics like Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, who have listened to the president describe how he has been denied due process. Many Republicans increasingly come to agree with Mr. Trump about the validity of the inquiry, according to people familiar with the meetings. The White House and some of Mr. Trump\u2019s closest allies on Capitol Hill have also pushed for building more aggressive support in the House and the Senate. In recent weeks, they have put the weight of the presidency behind an effort to persuade Georgia\u2019s governor to appoint Representative Doug Collins, currently the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, to the state\u2019s soon-to-be vacant Senate seat. Mr. Collins has actively jockeyed for the appointment, which would not only put a reliable defender of the president into a key Senate position before a trial, but could allow someone like Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio or Representative John Ratcliffe of Texas, pugnacious faces of Mr. Trump\u2019s impeachment defense so far, to replace Mr. Collins on the House Judiciary Committee as the impeachment process shifts there. The ascension of Mr. Jordan or Mr. Ratcliffe would also create another vacancy that Republican leaders could fill with a defender of the president like Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina. But even without the reinforcements, congressional Republicans \u2014 many of whom are wary of incurring the president\u2019s wrath and being punished for it by their party \u2014 have either echoed the White House claims against witnesses or found other ways to try to maintain focus on the Bidens, often in starkly personal terms. Senator Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, who has bound herself to Mr. Trump, used Twitter to attack Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman, a National Security Council official who was on the July 25 call the president held with Mr. Zelensky, and testified this week that he was immediately alarmed by the request for an investigation into the Bidens. \u201cVindictive Vindman is the \u2018whistle-blower\u2019s\u2019 handler,\u201d Ms. Blackburn tweeted, referring to the anonymous government official whose concerns about the call prompted the House impeachment inquiry. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and a key ally of Mr. Trump\u2019s, has shown his support for the president in other ways. On Friday, Mr. Graham announced plans to call Hunter Biden as a witness in a Senate trial.",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump sought to defend himself from hours of damaging congressional testimony on Wednesday from Gordon D. Sondland, his ambassador to the European Union, by focusing on one detail of the envoy\u2019s lengthy account: a phone call in September in which the president denied withholding military aid to Ukraine as leverage to pressure that country\u2019s leaders to announce investigations into his political rivals. \u201cReady?\u201d Mr. Trump yelled at reporters on the South Lawn, having stopped on his way to boarding Marine One. \u201cDo you have the cameras rolling?\u201d The president then began reading from a notepad of talking points scrawled in Sharpie paraphrasing his comments in the phone conversation, as recounted by Mr. Sondland: \u201cI want nothing. I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo. Tell Zelensky\" \u2014 referring to President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine \u2014 \u201cto do the right thing.\u201d In Mr. Trump\u2019s final line of notes, he wrote that it would be the \u201cfinal word\u201d from him on the matter. Mr. Sondland testified on Wednesday that he had a conversation with the president on Sept. 9, and that an irritated Mr. Trump had told him he had never requested a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d from Mr. Zelensky. But Mr. Trump\u2019s comments ignored the bulk of the testimony offered by Mr. Sondland, who asserted that the president had expressly ordered him to work with his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani to dredge up unflattering information on his political rivals. Mr. Sondland also said the senior-most members of the administration were aware of the effort, including Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Mick Mulvaney, Mr. Trump\u2019s acting chief of staff. \u201cEveryone was in the loop,\u201d Mr. Sondland said. \u201cIt was no secret.\u201d The call between the president and Mr. Sondland \u2014 who was a high-dollar donor to Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration before embarking on a career in diplomacy \u2014 took place the same day the whistle-blower complaint that formed the basis for the impeachment inquiry was delivered to the House Intelligence Committee. Mr. Sondland said Mr. Trump was \u201cnot in a good mood\u201d that day. \u201cIt was a very short abrupt conversation,\u201d Mr. Sondland said about the September call. \u201cHe just said, \u2018I want nothing, I want nothing, I want no quid pro quo.\u2019\u201d But Mr. Trump disputed that he had been cranky that day. \u201cI\u2019m always in a good mood,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what that is.\u201d The president\u2019s comments, delivered as he departed for a day trip to Austin, Texas, were followed by a statement from the White House press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, who said Mr. Sondland was detailing \u201cone of the few brief phone calls\u201d with Mr. Trump. \u201cThe U.S. aid to Ukraine flowed, no investigation was launched, and President Trump has met and spoken with President Zelensky,\u201d Ms. Grisham said. \u201cDemocrats keep chasing ghosts.\u201d Even as he quoted from Mr. Sondland\u2019s testimony to defend himself, Mr. Trump sought to distance himself from the more damaging parts of the testimony. \u201cI don\u2019t know him very well,\u201d Mr. Trump said to reporters of the ambassador. \u201cI have not spoken to him much. This is not a man I know well. He seems like a nice guy though.\u201d Throughout his presidency, Mr. Trump has used some version of the phrase \u201cI don\u2019t know him very well\u201d when commenting on people who have become threats, including his former lawyer Michael Cohen and the political strategist Roger Stone. Later in the day, Mr. Sondland responded to Mr. Trump\u2019s claim that he did not know the ambassador well. \u201cWe have a professional, cordial working relationship,\u201d Mr. Sondland said, adding that he had paid \u201ca lot of money\u201d to attend Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration, and had spoken to the president on the phone some 20 times. During his visit to an Apple plant in Austin, Mr. Trump again brandished a notepad to read another response to Mr. Sondland\u2019s testimony, which he called \u201cfantastic.\u201d Mr. Trump added: \u201cThey have to end it now. There was no quid pro quo. The president did absolutely nothing wrong.\u201d",

      "author": "Eileen Sullivan",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump unleashed a series of falsehoods on Friday in an effort to invalidate the impeachment inquiry and counter sworn testimony from officials in his own administration, after a week of damaging public hearings. In a 53-minute phone interview with \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d Mr. Trump accused David Holmes, a political counselor to the top American diplomat in Ukraine, of fabricating a phone call between Mr. Trump and the ambassador to the European Union. Mr. Holmes told impeachment investigators that he had overheard the president asking the ambassador, Gordon D. Sondland, about Ukrainian investigations into his political rivals, a consequential detail in the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry. \u201cI guarantee you that never took place,\u201d Mr. Trump said. He added that he barely knew Mr. Sondland, a wealthy hotelier from Oregon who contributed $1 million to Mr. Trump\u2019s inaugural committee. In his own testimony under oath, Mr. Sondland corroborated Mr. Holmes\u2019s account. The interview on Friday, broadcast live and commercial-free with a view of the \u201cFox & Friends\u201d hosts speaking by phone to Mr. Trump, gave the president a chance to respond to the damaging revelations of the past week and reprise widely debunked theories and some of his favorite lines of attack. To start, Mr. Trump called Representative Adam B. Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence committee, a \u201csick puppy,\u201d a \u201ccorrupt politician\u201d and the first witness he would want to call in a Senate impeachment trial. Will he be impeached? \u201cI don\u2019t expect it,\u201d the president said. \u201cI think it\u2019s very hard for them to impeach you when they have absolutely nothing.\u201d Some of Mr. Trump\u2019s top aides and legal advisers, anticipating that the Democratic-led House will impeach Mr. Trump, met with Republican senators on Thursday to strategize over what a Senate trial would look like. Mr. Trump also said he knows the identity of the anonymous whistle-blower whose complaint prompted the impeachment inquiry \u2014 and asserted that the details in the complaint were \u201cfake.\u201d The July 25 phone call between Mr. Trump and Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, was \u201cperfect.\u201d He said, \u201cWhy should we give money to a country that\u2019s known corrupt?\u201d Mr. Trump also said the Obama administration spied on his campaign, an accusation he leveled without evidence on Twitter in the early days of his administration. \u201cThey tried to overthrow the presidency. This is a disgrace.\u201d He also said Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election with the goal of helping Hillary Clinton, an unsubstantiated theory. \u201cDon\u2019t forget. Ukraine hated me. They were after me in the election.\u201d Fiona Hill, Mr. Trump\u2019s former top Europe and Russia expert, testified on Thursday that the claim was a dangerous, \u201cfictional narrative\u201d planted by Moscow to damage American democracy, and urged Republican lawmakers to abandon it, arguing that promoting the theory played into Russia\u2019s hands. And United States intelligence officials have recently informed senators that it was part of a yearslong Russian disinformation campaign. Mr. Trump tried to distance himself from Mr. Sondland, a wealthy hotelier who was a megadonor to the president\u2019s campaign. \u201cThis guy, Sondland: hardly know him,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI\u2019ve had a couple of conversations with him,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI see him hanging around when I go to Europe.\u201d Mr. Sondland is posted in Brussels and testified that he had spoken to the president on the phone some 20 times. Mr. Holmes in public testimony on Thursday described in detail a phone call between Mr. Trump and Mr. Sondland during a lunch with two other officials from the State Department, as they dined outdoors at a Kyiv restaurant and shared a bottle of wine. Mr. Holmes said Mr. Sondland and Mr. Trump were discussing a recent meeting with Mr. Zelensky, just one day after the phone call between the leaders, which is at the heart of the impeachment investigation. According to Mr. Holmes, the president asked Mr. Sondland if Mr. Zelensky would pursue the investigations he sought into Democrats. Mr. Sondland assured Mr. Trump that \u201che\u2019s going to do it,\u201d and that the Ukrainian leader would do \u201canything you ask him to.\u201d When the call ended, Mr. Holmes said the ambassador told him Mr. Trump did not care about Ukraine, only about \u201cbig things\u201d like the investigations into former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son, Hunter Biden. A day before Mr. Holmes\u2019s testimony, Mr. Sondland publicly implicated the president and other senior administration officials in the pressure campaign against Ukraine. In the Fox interview, Mr. Trump hit on a theme that Democrats and witnesses have raised during the impeachment hearings \u2014 how was it that Mr. Sondland, with no foreign policy experience and who was not the ambassador to Ukraine, found himself leading the United States policy with Ukraine. \u201cBut he was really the European Union ambassador, and all of a sudden he\u2019s working on this,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Friday. \u201cAsk about that.\u201d Mr. Sondland told lawmakers that Mr. Trump directed him to do so. In response to a cryptic tweet from John R. Bolton, his former national security adviser who has so far declined to testify in the House impeachment inquiry, Mr. Trump was asked whether he had frozen Mr. Bolton\u2019s Twitter account. \u201cNo, of course not. Of course not,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cNo, I actually had a good relationship with John. We disagreed on some things and some methods, but I actually had a good relationship.\u201d Mr. Bolton later posted more Twitter messages accusing the White House of blocking him from the personal account he had when he joined the president\u2019s staff last year. \u201cWe have now liberated the Twitter account, previously suppressed unfairly in the aftermath of my resignation as National Security Advisor,\u201d Mr. Bolton wrote. \u201cMore to come.\u201d He later added: \u201cRe: speaking up \u2014 since resigning as National Security Advisor, the @WhiteHouse refused to return access to my personal Twitter account. Out of fear of what I may say? To those who speculated I went into hiding, I\u2019m sorry to disappoint!\u201d Despite the tease, Mr. Bolton, who is writing a book, is unlikely to suddenly change his mind and begin discussing his opposition to the Ukraine pressure campaign in the near future. He is waiting for a judge to decide whether a House subpoena takes precedence over a White House request not to testify in the case of a former deputy. Until then, he has made clear that he does not intend to issue public statements the way Mick Mulvaney, the acting chief of staff, and other advisers to Mr. Trump have done, because that would risk waiving any claim of immunity.",

      "author": "Ana Swanson",
      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump refused to commit Friday to signing legislation overwhelmingly passed by Congress to support pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong, saying that he supported the protesters but that President Xi Jinping of China was \u201ca friend of mine.\u201d The bill comes as Mr. Trump is trying to strike a trade deal with China, one of the central goals of his presidency. It puts him in the delicate position of trying to win China\u2019s support for the pact while balancing growing calls from Congress to support the protesters who are taking on Beijing. \u201cI stand with Hong Kong,\u201d he said during a nearly hourlong interview on the morning program \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d \u201cI stand with freedom. I stand with all of the things we want to do. But we\u2019re also in the process of making the largest trade deal in history.\u201d Mr. Trump spoke warmly about Mr. Xi, calling him \u201can incredible guy\u201d and \u201ca friend of mine.\u201d And he credited his trade negotiation with China as the reason Mr. Xi had not already extinguished the protests with a sweeping and violent crackdown that would have killed \u201cthousands\u201d of people. \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for me, Hong Kong would have been obliterated in 14 minutes,\u201d Mr. Trump said. But Mr. Trump\u2019s apparent willingness to tie human rights issues to progress on the trade front drew rebukes from Republicans and Democrats, who said such positioning risked compromising the United States\u2019 role as a global defender of democracy. \u201cMake no mistake: President Trump\u2019s words today do not reflect what the American people or the Congress think about President Xi\u2019s oppressive policies toward the people of Hong Kong,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer, the minority leader. \u201cFor a guy who promised to be tough on China, President Trump\u2019s reliable deference to President Xi is all the more bewildering.\u201d Senator Rick Scott, Republican of Florida, said that a veto from Mr. Trump \u201cwould be a mistake. Congress spoke loud and clear that we #StandWithHongKong.\u201d He added, \u201cIt\u2019s more important than a trade deal.\u201d Security forces in Hong Kong have escalated their crackdown on pro-democracy protesters this month, prompting Congress this week to approve a Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act it had been considering for months. The legislation would impose sanctions on Chinese officials who commit human rights abuses in the semiautonomous island territory and place Hong Kong\u2019s special economic status under greater scrutiny. The measure passed the Senate unanimously and the House by a vote of 417 to 1, with the only dissenting vote from Representative Thomas Massie, Republican of Kentucky. The bill comes at a delicate time in United States-China relations. Mr. Trump\u2019s trade negotiations with Beijing have stalled before an important Dec. 15 deadline, when the president must decide whether to issue yet more tariffs on Chinese goods. The president announced on Oct. 11 that he had reached a trade agreement with China, but in the weeks since the two countries have continued to spar over its terms. Chinese negotiators insist that Mr. Trump must roll back more of the tariffs he has placed on more than $360 billion of their products, while American negotiators say China\u2019s concessions still fall short. This is not the first time that Mr. Trump has mixed trade and noneconomic issues. At times, he has responded to personal requests from Mr. Xi by offering China concessions that have angered some members of Congress. In May 2018, Mr. Trump tweeted that he was working with Mr. Xi to give ZTE, a Chinese company the United States had punished for violating Iran sanctions, \u201ca way to get back into business.\u201d His administration has also repeatedly waived tough measures on the Chinese telecom firm Huawei, against the urging of Senator Marco Rubio and others lawmakers. Mr. Trump has typically avoided commenting on the escalating battle between pro-democracy demonstrators and security forces in Hong Kong, and in June, he privately assured the Chinese president that he would not publicly back the protesters as long as trade talks were progressing. At times, Mr. Trump and other administration officials have warned that increasing violence from the Chinese authorities would have wider repercussions in the relationship between Washington and Beijing, including in the trade talks. Analysts say there are many reasons China\u2019s government has refrained from an all-out violent crackdown like the one that snuffed pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square in Beijing in 1989. They include the risk of an enormous international backlash and lasting damage to Hong Kong\u2019s powerhouse economy. If Mr. Trump decides not to sign the legislation on Hong Kong, it will still probably pass into law. Congress approved the bill with an overwhelming majority, meaning that it could easily overcome a presidential veto, in what would be the first override of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency. Mr. Trump could also choose not to sign the bill without vetoing it, in which case it would become law on Dec. 3. Either course of action is likely to generate significant blowback from members of Congress who have urged the president to take a tough stance on China, including Mr. Rubio, a Republican of Florida and a sponsor of the bill in the Senate. Speaking on CNBC on Thursday, Mr. Rubio said his understanding was that the president would sign it. \u201cThere was a unanimous vote in the Senate and only one vote against it in the House,\u201d Mr. Rubio said. But when questioned this week, Mr. Trump has twice declined to say whether he would support the legislation. Mr. Trump\u2019s interview on Friday provoked a swift response from some who have encouraged the president\u2019s tough trade posture on China. \u201cIf he does veto this bill, sacrificing American values in the process, Congress should immediately and overwhelmingly override,\u201d said Scott Paul, the president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, which represents steel companies and workers. Mr. Trump\u2019s comments did not please Chinese commentators, either. \u201cPresident Trump told Fox, if it weren\u2019t for him, thousands of people would\u2019ve been killed in HK and HK would have been obliterated in 14 minutes,\u201d Hu Xijin, the outspoken editor in chief for the state-run Global Times, wrote on Twitter. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s something a president should boast of. And I don\u2019t think there should be people who like to hear such hot air.\u201d In a news conference on Thursday, Geng Shuang, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said China condemned and opposed the passage of the bill. \u201cWe urge the U.S. to grasp the situation, stop its wrongdoing before it\u2019s too late, and take measures to prevent this act from becoming law,\u201d he said. \u201cChina will have to take strong countermeasures if the U.S. is bent on having its own way.\u201d",

The world is now a much safer place,\u201d the president said.By The New York TimesPRINT EDITIONPresident Trump\u2019s Remarks on Baghdadi\u2019s Death|October 28, 2019, Page A9",
      "author": "The New York Times",
      "content": " This is a transcript of the statement by President Trump about the death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi: Last night, the United States brought the world\u2019s No. 1 terrorist leader to justice. Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is dead. He was the founder and leader of ISIS, the most ruthless and violent terror organization anywhere in the world. The United States has been searching for Baghdadi for many years. Capturing or killing Baghdadi has been the top national security priority of my administration. U.S. Special Operations forces executed a dangerous and daring nighttime raid in northwestern Syria and accomplished their mission in grand style. The U.S. personnel were incredible. I got to watch much of it. No personnel were lost in the operation, while a large number of Baghdadi\u2019s fighters and companions were killed with him. He died after running into a dead-end tunnel, whimpering and crying and screaming all the way. The compound had been cleared by this time, with people either surrendering or being shot and killed. Eleven young children were moved out of the house uninjured. The only ones remaining were Baghdadi in the tunnel, and he had dragged three of his young children with him. They were led to certain death. He reached the end of the tunnel, as our dogs chased him down. He ignited his vest, killing himself and the three children. His body was mutilated by the blast, the tunnel had caved in on it in addition, but test results gave certain, immediate and totally positive identification it was him. The thug who tried so hard to intimidate others spent his last moments in utter fear, in total panic and dread \u2014 terrified of the American forces bearing down on him. We were in the compound for approximately two hours, and after the mission was accomplished, we took highly sensitive material and information from the raid, much having to do with ISIS, origins, future plans, things that we very much want. Baghdadi\u2019s demise demonstrates America\u2019s relentless pursuit of terrorist leaders, and our commitment to the enduring and total defeat of ISIS and other terrorist organizations. Our reach is very long. As you know, last month we announced that we recently killed Hamza bin Laden, the very violent son of Osama bin Laden, who was saying very bad things about people, about our country, about the world. He was the heir apparent to Al Qaeda. Terrorists who oppress and murder innocent people should never sleep soundly, knowing that we will completely destroy them. These savage monsters will not escape their fate \u2014 and they will not escape the final judgment of God. Baghdadi has been on the run for many years, long before I took office. But at my direction, as commander-in-chief of the United States, we obliterated his caliphate, 100 percent, in March of this year. Today\u2019s events are another reminder that we will continue to pursue the remaining ISIS terrorists to their brutal end. That also goes for other terrorist organizations. They are likewise in our sights. Baghdadi and the losers who worked with him \u2014 and losers they are \u2014 they had no idea what they were getting into. In some cases they were very frightened puppies, in other cases they were hard-core killers. But they killed many, many people. Their murder of innocent Americans James Foley, Steven Sotloff, Peter Kassig and Kayla Mueller were especially heinous. The shocking publicized murder of Jordanian pilot \u2014 a wonderful young man, spoke to the king of Jordan, they all knew him, they all loved him \u2014 who was burned alive in a cage for all to see, and the execution of Christians in Libya and Egypt, as well as the genocidal mass murder of Yazidis, rank ISIS among the most depraved organizations in the history of our world. The forced religious conversions, the orange suits prior to so many beheadings, all of which were openly displayed for the world to see \u2014 this was all that Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi \u2014 this is what he wanted, this is what he was proud of. He was a sick and depraved man. And now he\u2019s gone. Baghdadi was vicious and violent, and he died in a vicious and violent way, as a coward, running and crying. This raid was impeccable, and could only have taken place with the acknowledgment and help of certain other nations and people. I want to thank the nations of Russia, Turkey, Syria and Iraq, and I also want to thank the Syrian Kurds for certain support they were able to give us. This was a very, very dangerous mission. Thank you as well to the great intelligence professionals who helped make this very successful journey possible. I want to thank the soldiers and sailors, airmen and Marines involved in last night\u2019s operation. You are the very best there is anywhere in the world, no matter where you go there is nobody even close. I want to thank Gen. Mark Milley and our Joint Chiefs of Staff, and I also want to thank our professionals who work in other agencies of the United States government and were critical to the mission\u2019s unbelievable success. Last night was a great night for the United States and for the world. A brutal killer, one who has caused so much hardship and death, has violently been eliminated \u2014 he will never again harm another innocent man, woman or child. He died like a dog. He died like a coward. The world is now a much safer place. God bless America, thank you.",

He called the values of Chicago\u2019s police superintendent, Eddie Johnson, who had pointedly skipped the president\u2019s address, a \u201cdisgrace.\u201d He criticized the city\u2019s open stance toward immigrants. He said Chicago was notorious around the globe for its violence. \u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing to us as a nation,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cAll over the world, they\u2019re talking about Chicago.\u201d In Chicago, where Mr. Trump won less than 13 percent of the vote in 2016, residents responded with equal contempt, gathering by the thousands outside his curvy skyscraper on the river downtown, where he later attended a private fund-raiser. Protesters hoisted rainbow-colored letters spelling \u201cResist\u201d with the famous corncob-shaped Marina City towers standing in the background. Some in attendance wore red, the color representing Chicago\u2019s public schoolteachers, who have been on strike for eight days in a dispute with the city administration. One man held a small sign to his chest that simply read \u201cGo away.\u201d The police shut down entire blocks of Upper Wacker Drive, one of downtown\u2019s major thoroughfares, leaving the Loop unusually choked with traffic. Marsha Durbin, a registered nurse who lives in Indiana and wore a Trump T-shirt, said she was determined to defend the president\u2019s name in the face of an overwhelmingly liberal crowd. \u201cI think he\u2019s doing a great job,\u201d she said. \u201cWe would have globalism without him. And thank God he\u2019s here addressing the violence problem.\u201d But for many Chicagoans, the gathering had a cathartic, festive feel, with a brass band playing, children dancing and many in the crowd chanting in praise of their city. (\u201cWhat city protects democracy? Chicago!\u201d) Ian Wallace, a 38-year-old stay-at-home parent from the Old Town neighborhood whose children attend public elementary school, said he was drawn to the protest to stand against Mr. Trump, his policies and his frequent attacks on Chicago. \u201cWe wanted to show our disappointment with him,\u201d Mr. Wallace said beside three of his children. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of negative things you hear about Chicago, and it\u2019s almost always from someone who doesn\u2019t live here. We love our city.\u201d Mr. Trump in recent weeks has been showing up in places where he is unpopular, including the San Francisco Bay Area and Minneapolis, and in his brief day trip to Chicago on Monday, he mostly avoided its residents in favor of out-of-town conference attendees. Last week, Mr. Johnson, the superintendent, said he did not plan to attend Mr. Trump\u2019s speech to police leaders because it \u201cdoesn\u2019t line up with our city\u2019s core values, along with my personal values.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t in good conscience stand by while racial insults and hatred are cast from the Oval Office, or Chicago is held hostage because of our views on New Americans,\u201d he said in a statement. Speaking to the International Association of Chiefs of Police, Mr. Trump questioned Mr. Johnson\u2019s values and said he protected illegal immigrants in a violent city. \u201cHere\u2019s a man that could not bother to show up for a meeting of police chiefs, the most respected people in the country, in his hometown and with the president of the United States,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cAnd you know why? It\u2019s because he\u2019s not doing his job.\u201d Mr. Johnson called a news conference to rebut Mr. Trump, pointing out that homicides and shootings have seen double-digit percentage declines in recent years. Chicago has more murders than Los Angeles or New York does, but it has significantly fewer than it did in 2016, when there were 762 murders in the city. \u201cToday, the same police officers the president criticized for their inability to protect this city spent all day protecting him,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. Mayor Lori Lightfoot chimed in on Twitter: \u201cRather than belittle Chicago\u2019s communities with hateful and dishonest rhetoric, he needs to go back to D.C. and face his fate.\u201d Mr. Trump has frequently criticized Chicago and its crime rate, but he had avoided the city since being elected. In March 2016, he planned a rally in the city but, facing heavy protests, canceled it just before it was scheduled to begin.",

For the most part, members of the president\u2019s innermost circle have refrained from publicly critiquing Mr. Mueller\u2019s performance, which spanned several hours and were marked by the special prosecutor\u2019s refusal to stray from the text of the report his team had prepared and submitted to the Justice Department. At different points, Mr. Mueller appeared uncertain about specifics that he was asked about. The younger Mr. Trump was a focus of the Mueller probe in part because of his meeting in June 2016 with a Kremlin-linked lawyer who claimed to have \u201cdirt\u201d about Hillary Clinton. He also was a focus of the investigations by the House and Senate since soon after his father took office, sitting for hours of interviews. Mr. Trump took an aggressive stance on social media countering allegations of a possible conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russian officials, a posture that he writes that he was cautioned against. \u201cEven my lawyers approached me and said, \u2018Don, you might want to slow down on social media, maybe not be so aggressive.\u2019 I politely declined. Shortly after that, my father \u2014 yes, my father, Donald J. Trump, our tweeter-in-chief, the so-called Shakespeare of 140 characters \u2014 told me that I might be getting \u2018a little too hot\u2019 on my social media accounts,\u201d he writes. \u201cI respect the heck out of my dad, and when he gives me advice I take it ninety-nine point nine percent of the time. This, however, was probably the one time I decided not to listen!\u201d But he also describes Twitter as an \u201caddiction\u201d for many. In a telephone interview, Mr. Trump said he decided to address the Mueller probe the way he did after he was subject to two years of acute scrutiny. \u201cThe reality is, my life took a pretty big turn about three years ago,\u201d Mr. Trump said. In the book, Mr. Trump writes mockingly about the path he might have taken as the Mueller probe played out if he were a different person. \u201cIf I were \u2018most people,\u2019 this chapter might be a little different. Maybe it would open on the afternoon the Mueller Report came out. There\u2019d be some vivid writing about how relieved I felt, how I could breathe easily for the first time in years,\u201d he writes. \u201cOr maybe there\u2019d be scenes from right in the middle of the whole ordeal, and I\u2019d tell you about how I\u2019d curled up in a corner every night with a teddy bear praying that I wasn\u2019t going to go to prison over this made-up nonsense,\u201d he writes. \u201cI might include some tear-filled speeches from my friends and family about how they were going to stick with me till the end, how they brought me strength in troubled times.\u201d He mentions Joseph R. Biden Jr., the former vice president, but the book went to press before Mr. Trump\u2019s father began drawing attention to work that Mr. Biden\u2019s son Hunter did with a Ukrainian company while Mr. Biden was in office. That work was part of an investigation that the president pushed Ukrainian officials to pursue, which is at the heart of the impeachment inquiry. Mr. Trump spends sections of the book describing his father bringing him to building sites as a child. He talks about his childhood years spent with his mother\u2019s parents, and how he ended up as the member of his family who speaks the language of the political right most naturally. \u201cI\u2019m an unlikely conservative,\u201d he said in the interview.",

Here\u2019s Why He Lost.In Louisiana and Kentucky, Mr. Trump\u2019s political pleas appeared to energize Democrats and political moderates as much as his own base, sending turnout in cities and suburbs soaring.By Jonathan Martin and Maggie HabermanPRINT EDITIONAnother Contender Backed by Trump Loses in a Red State|November 18, 2019, Page A9",
      "author": "Jonathan Martin",
      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 When President Trump showed up in Louisiana for the third time in just over a month to try to help Republicans win the governor\u2019s race, he veered off script and got to the heart of why he was staging such an unusual political intervention. His attempt to lift Gov. Matt Bevin of Kentucky to victory this month had failed, Mr. Trump explained, and it would look bad for him to lose another race in a heavily Republican state. \u201cYou got to give me a big win, please, O.K.,\u201d the president pleaded with a red-hatted crowd last Thursday in Bossier City, La. But on Saturday night, Mr. Trump\u2019s wager backfired in spectacular fashion. Not only did Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, win re-election by more than 40,000 votes, he did so with the same coalition that propelled Governor-elect Andy Beshear to victory in Kentucky and that could put the president\u2019s re-election chances in grave jeopardy next year. Like Mr. Beshear, Mr. Edwards energized a combination of African-Americans and moderate whites in and around the urban centers of his state, building decisive margins in New Orleans, Baton Rouge and Shreveport. It was a striking setback for a president who proclaimed himself his party\u2019s kingmaker in last year\u2019s midterms, but has a decidedly mixed record when it comes to pushing his chosen candidates to victory in general elections. And it continued a November losing streak that included not only Mr. Bevin\u2019s loss in Kentucky, but a wave of state and local Democratic victories in Virginia, Pennsylvania and Missouri that also were driven by suburban voters. The results in Kentucky and Louisiana are particularly ominous for the president, in part because they indicate that his suburban problem extends to traditionally conservative Southern states and may prove even more perilous in the moderate Midwest next year. They also reveal political weakness for the president at a moment he is embroiled in a deepening impeachment inquiry and desperately needs to project strength with his own party. And as he enters what will likely be a difficult re-election campaign, the two states emphatically demonstrated that he has become just as much of a turnout lever for the opposition as with his own supporters. [Why many voters are tuning out impeachment news.] \u201cIf you had any doubt that Trump was a human repellent spray for suburban voters who have a conservative disposition, Republicans getting wiped out in the suburbs of New Orleans, Louisville and Lexington should remove it,\u201d said Tim Miller, a Republican strategist and outspoken critic of the president. The Louisiana results are a stinging rebuke for the president, because he spent so much time there and because Trump allies couldn\u2019t chalk it up entirely to local factors as they did for Kentucky, where Mr. Bevin was deeply unpopular. And even before the Louisiana race was called on Saturday night, finger-pointing from the Capitol to the White House to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign broke out about why he spent so much political capital on the race in the first place. Mr. Trump carried Louisiana by 20 points in 2016, so the outcome of the governor\u2019s race carries no implications for his own re-election, the balance of power in Congress or the president\u2019s policy agenda. And the moderate Mr. Edwards has relentlessly cultivated Mr. Trump, showing up at the White House every chance he gets \u2014 so it was not even an opportunity to defeat a critic. Some of the president\u2019s advisers were mystified, therefore, that the White House would repeatedly send him to a state irrelevant to his re-election for a candidate he scarcely knows, Eddie Rispone, after they had just been scalded in their attempt to rescue Mr. Bevin in another safely red state. In Congress, Louisiana lawmakers and their aides grumbled that Mr. Trump was not being shown quality polling indicating how formidable Mr. Edwards was with Republican-leaning voters. And some in the delegation pointed a finger at Louisiana\u2019s voluble junior senator, John Kennedy, who has become a close White House ally, for pushing the president to campaign in the state. But the president was receptive to Republicans who told him he could be the difference-maker in these elections, according to G.O.P. officials briefed on the discussions. One of those people said that Ronna McDaniel, the Republican National Committee chairwoman, had been preparing the president for the past two weeks for the possibility of a Louisiana loss. That\u2019s because early voting patterns showed Democrats mobilizing their core voters, especially African-Americans. \n\nMr. Trump\u2019s supporters defended him, noting that Republicans won down-ballot in Kentucky and captured the Mississippi governor\u2019s race, while arguing that he would benefit from a polarizing opponent next year. \u201cThe gubernatorial results in 2019 in Kentucky and Louisiana are in no way a referendum on President Trump or a foreshadowing of the 2020 presidential election,\u201d said the R.N.C. spokesman Mike Reed. \u201cThe Democrats who ran for governor in those red states aren\u2019t anything like the far-left candidates running against President Trump.\u2019\u2019 Still, the main instigator for the president\u2019s involvement in the races, many Republicans said, was Mr. Trump himself, who simply craves the adulation of his supporters and is singularly focused on notching victories, no matter the details. He is even more eager to flex his political muscle in the face of impeachment, and has surrounded himself with several aides who either defer to his whims regardless of the neon-flashing signs of risk before them, or know little about politics.\n\nPeople close to Mr. Trump \u2014 who spoke anonymously to discuss sensitive matters \u2014 said he viewed the campaigns he had weighed in on mostly as opportunities for gratification. And with few seasoned political advisers in his inner circle \u2014 his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who has control over the president\u2019s campaign, has never worked on another race \u2014 there was nobody to tell him that attacking an anti-abortion rights, pro-gun Democrat like Mr. Edwards as a radical would be folly. \u201cThere were people who are normally part of the Republican base who voted for the governor,\u201d said Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, noting that the portrayal of Mr. Edwards as a liberal extremist was ineffective given his views on cultural issues and credentials as a West Pointer turned Army Ranger. \u201cHe\u2019s a very likable man and a man of character.\u201d \n\nOf course, plenty of well-credentialed and well-liked candidates have fallen prey to the forbidding political demographics of their states or districts. What was different in Louisiana was that Mr. Edwards enjoyed a huge spike between the all-party primary last month and the Saturday runoff among the voters who Mr. Trump most alienates: While turnout grew modestly in many of the rural areas, it jumped by 29 percent in New Orleans and 25 percent in the parish that includes Shreveport, and it was nearly as high in Baton Rouge and in the largest New Orleans suburbs. In that context, Mr. Trump\u2019s two appearances in the state between the primary and runoff had the effect of motivating the Democratic base as much as it did the conservative one. \"Forcing Trump down people\u2019s throats in television, mail and radio produced a backlash among Democratic voters, especially African-Americans,\u201d said Zac McCrary, a pollster on Mr. Edwards\u2019s campaign, alluding to Mr. Rispone\u2019s Trump-centric message. \u201cThe intense negatives outweigh the intense positives for Trump, which speaks to the turnout.\u201d\n\nState and local Democrats were more careful targeting their message, linking Mr. Rispone to Mr. Trump on radio stations with black audiences and in tailored mailers. But Mr. Trump\u2019s engagement also prompted organic efforts, including some from liberals who aren\u2019t exactly enamored with Mr. Edwards but wanted to send a message of their own from Louisiana. One New Orleans Democrat took matters into her own hands and created an Instagram account, @youcanringmybel, that sought to rally reluctant progressives for Mr. Edwards. \u201cWe don\u2019t love him but we need him,\u201d said the site\u2019s creator, Marcelle Beaulieu. \u201cRispone has made the entire campaign about national politics and Trump,\u201d she added, and that annoyed many voters.\n\nThe former Democratic National Committee chairwoman Donna Brazile, a native of the New Orleans area, said the only other time she had been able to nudge her entire extended family to go to the polls was to support former President Barack Obama in 2008. \n\n\u201dDonald Trump just has the same effect of pushing people out the door when they would prefer to stay home,\u201d said Ms. Brazile. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen folks more unified.\u201d \n\nMr. Trump, of course, is not the first president to be faulted for his party\u2019s losses. But few have so openly invited the risk of being blamed for them. \n\n\u201cDonald Trump just happens to relish this centrality more than most,\u201d said Liam Donovan, a Republican strategist, \u201cand has a tendency to say the quiet part loud, sometimes to his detriment.\u201d",

      "author": "Katie Rogers",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 On the eve of the first public hearing in the Democratic-led impeachment against President Trump, his eldest son was standing in the lobby of the family hotel, delivering firm handshakes and turning over copies of his book, \u201cTriggered: How the Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us,\u201d to supporters who had paid $32 for the experience. As he received his readers at the Trump International Hotel, Mr. Trump said that he hadn\u2019t given much thought to what might transpire the next morning. But then he added, \u201cI think it\u2019s eventually going to come back to bite them in the ass.\u201d Presumably he meant the Democrats. It was actually just the sort of profane flourish that appears throughout \u201cTriggered,\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s literary debut and 287-page castigation of socialism, Democrats and the news media. It is written from the vantage point of a 41-year-old \u201cson of a rich white guy living in 2019,\u201d as Mr. Trump describes himself. He suggests early on that this identity renders him unable to voice an opinion without being attacked. It is a grievance he shares with his father, whom he paints as a tough-love figure throughout the book, as well as the \u201cShakespeare of 140 characters,\u201d a wink to his father\u2019s Twitter account. Like the president, he doesn\u2019t deal in subtleties: \u201cThroughout the entire Russia investigation, it seemed, the Democrats in Congress had only one reason to exist, and that was to try and make my father and me cower in a corner, curl up in a ball, and die,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote in one passage. He reserves a special amount of ire for the special counsel investigation, led by Robert S. Mueller III, because, as he puts it, he was No. 2 \u201con the guy\u2019s kill list for years.\u201d So it was little surprise that the fractious book tour for \u201cTriggered\u201d courted the same kind of controversy that the president can regularly gin up with one errant tweet. The book launch left in its wake a trail of far-right protesters, angry television hosts, and even squabbles at Costco \u2014 otherwise known as the happiest place to buy bulk toilet paper on earth. Basically, things went according to plan. With his father \u2014 whom he refers to throughout the book simply as \u201cDJT\u201d \u2014 fighting impeachment down the street, Mr. Trump, a valuable Republican surrogate and Trump rally fixture, has used his new platform as an author to try to reframe the story of the 2016 election, the special counsel investigation, and all of the battles that came after. Still, the president\u2019s son had help getting his message out and it came in the form of Trump campaign and Republican National Committee resources. On social media, the Trump campaign has helped share his interview clips, including a contentious appearance last week on \u201cThe View\u201d that featured Mr. Trump sparring alongside his girlfriend, the former Fox News host and current campaign adviser Kimberly Guilfoyle. That conversation quickly devolved into a cross-talk-laden argument over the particulars of a July call between the president and Volodymyr Zelensky, the president of Ukraine, which forms the basis of the inquiry. A key question is whether the president withheld military aid to Ukraine in exchange for a promise by Mr. Zelensky to investigate a chief political opponent, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. \u201cNo one knew any aid was even being withheld,\u201d Mr. Trump said on the program, which conflicts with accounts given to congressional investigators that the Ukranians were aware of the situation by early August. \u201cBut that\u2019s not true,\u201d the co-host Sunny Hostin interjected. \u201cThat\u2019s a lie.\u201d Throughout that appearance, conservative personalities affiliated with the campaign were quick to edit video clips and blast out triumphant tweets in support of the couple \u2014 a forceful showing for an interview ostensibly about the book. On Twitter, Mr. Trump crowed that his appearance had shattered recent ratings records for the program. As a first-time author, Mr. Trump has had promotional help in other key areas: The Republican National Committee messaged its email list, asking supporters to chip in several dollar amounts \u2014 ranging from $50 to $250 \u2014 to support the book. (One subject line: \u201cThe left doesn\u2019t want you to read this book.\u201d) Mike Reed, a spokesman for the committee, wrote in an email that the organization had supported books by noncandidates before, including Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker. \u201cUsing books as a means to fund-raise is standard practice from political parties on both sides of the aisle,\u201d Mr. Reed said, pointing out that several Democratic campaigns have done the same. \u201c\u2018Triggered\u2019 has been very popular among our supporters, helping us raise funds to support the re-election effort.\u201d President Trump has also weighed in, saying on Twitter last weekend that he had finished his son\u2019s book, and that the younger Trump, \u201calong with many of us, was very unfairly treated.\u201d People close to him say that president is not much of a reader, but he does follow the television coverage of the books he promotes, paying attention to how well they do. \u201cTriggered\u201d is hovering around No. 4 on the ever-fluctuating Amazon best-seller list, sandwiched between Nikki Haley\u2019s \u201cWith All Due Respect\u201d and a children\u2019s book written by the Bush sisters. Marji Ross, the president of the conservative Regnery Publishing, which is not associated with Mr. Trump\u2019s book, said in an email that the 24-hour news cycle associated with the Trump era has led to an increased appetite for political titles. \u201cI think it\u2019s very healthy for citizens to want to know more about the issues and events shaping our world,\u201d Ms. Ross said, \u201cif only to get a better idea for how the other half of the country thinks.\u201d \u201cTriggered,\u201d at the very least, is a glimpse into how one prominent family thinks. It was written before the impeachment began, but the anger present in Mr. Trump\u2019s writing seems to be a one-emotion-fits-all reaction to the political hardships he believes he and his family has endured. The chapters have names like \u201cCOUNTERPUNCH\u201d and \u201cCLASS WARFARE,\u201d and the book is dedicated to the \u201cDEPLORABLES.\u201d Throughout the book, Mr. Trump tries to reinforce the point that he and his family members are rich but relatable. He relays several life lessons his father has taught him: You shouldn\u2019t expect to get anything in life you don\u2019t work for. If you don\u2019t ask for it, don\u2019t expect it. And when someone goes around offering things for free, don\u2019t believe them. \u201cIn most cases,\u201d Mr. Trump writes, \u201cthat person is either a liar or an idiot. Or a leftist, which means they\u2019re both.\u201d The book was designed to anger liberals, but \u201cTriggered\u201d has angered groups that his family has spent a significant amount of time courting. In one passage, he compares watching his father visit Arlington National Cemetery to the political sacrifices his family has made, which drew a rebuke from veterans associations. And a stop at U.C.L.A. in California over the weekend, Mr. Trump and Ms. Guilfoyle left the stage at a book event after a group of far-right protesters, dismayed at the lack of opportunity to ask questions, began chanting. As Mr. Trump stood by, Ms. Guilfoyle chided the group: \u201cYou\u2019re not making your parents proud by being rude and disruptive and discourteous,\u201d before adding, \u201cI bet you engage and go on online dating because you\u2019re impressing no one here to get a date in person.\u201d The event on Tuesday at the Trump International Hotel had no such hint of protest: The property was swarmed by Secret Service agents, and each supporter passed their belongings through a metal detector. When asked what his father liked most about the book, Mr. Trump demurred, telling a reporter he had more supporters to greet. ",

Now He\u2019s Facing Impeachment.The student body president of the University of Florida is under fire for using student fees to host one of President Trump\u2019s sons.By Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs and Hannah PhillipsPRINT EDITIONNovember 14, 2019",
      "author": "Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs",
      "content": "  A sitting president is facing impeachment, accused of collusion and abusing his power. Support falls along political lines: The opposition party is determined to remove him, while his allies maintain he did nothing wrong. But this impeachment inquiry is taking place far from Washington \u2014 even though a football stadium known as \u201cThe Swamp\u201d looms nearby. Student representatives at the University of Florida introduced a bill on Tuesday to impeach Michael Murphy, the student body president, accusing him of improperly using student fees to pay one of President Trump\u2019s sons to speak on campus. It all began when Mr. Murphy, a senior, invited Donald Trump Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle, a former Fox News host and adviser to the president\u2019s campaign, to speak on campus and paid them $50,000 with university funds. Some students say the payment was a violation of the Student Senate code \u2014 and possibly the law. The backlash intensified after the campus newspaper, The Independent Florida Alligator, published emails showing that Mr. Murphy had spoken with a consultant for President Trump\u2019s re-election committee to set up the visit and that Mr. Murphy had attended Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration. Students who drafted the impeachment bill personally handed Mr. Murphy a copy of it on Tuesday night. They argue in the bill that Mr. Murphy\u2019s use of the student funds violated the Student Senate code, which forbids spending student fees to support a political party. State law, they add, forbids using state funds, which cover some students\u2019 fees, to support a political campaign. Although they are sometimes in charge of allocating millions of dollars, student governments garner relatively little interest from students and their inner workings are rarely covered outside of campus newspapers. But on Wednesday, students in Gainesville seemed to know more about the controversy engulfing Mr. Murphy than who was testifying in Washington. The visit from the younger Mr. Trump and Ms. Guilfoyle, and the furor surrounding Mr. Murphy, have led to a sour split on campus. Jarrod Rodriguez, a junior and the treasurer for the University of Florida College Republicans, said the impeachment move was \u201ca mirror image of the partisan politics at the national level.\u201d He said he had attended the talk and never viewed it as a campaign event. The drive to oust Mr. Murphy, he said, showed that the opposition party would look for anything to remove the elected president. \u201cI think that they have no cigar \u2014 in both cases,\u201d he said. Theresa Chapman, a senior who was handing out fliers and pins for Planned Parenthood on campus, saw things differently. She said the funds Mr. Murphy had spent to bring the president\u2019s son to town could have been better spent on something more beneficial and less divisive. \u201cClearly he\u2019s just not fit,\u201d Ms. Chapman said of Mr. Murphy, adding that the same applied to President Trump. \u201cHe\u2019s not here to support the entire student body. Only a portion of it.\u201d The visit by the president\u2019s son filled a campus auditorium on Oct. 10, but he was frequently interrupted and many protested outside, The Alligator reported. Before Mr. Trump\u2019s speech with Ms. Guilfoyle, whom he is dating, some students had called for Mr. Murphy and several other student leaders to resign. But the correspondence between Mr. Murphy and Caroline Wren, a Republican operative who is now a fund-raising consultant with a re-election committee for the president, was the last straw for the student representatives who filed the impeachment bill. They said the emails, which were obtained through a public records request by Mariana Castro, an alumna, and shared with the student newspaper, were proof that the speech was a campaign event. \u201cImpeachment became the only option,\u201d said Ben Lima, a senior and one of the student representatives who sponsored the bill. Ms. Wren said in a statement that she was not representing the Trump campaign when she emailed Mr. Murphy about inviting Mr. Trump to campus and that she had forgotten to remove her \u201cTrump Victory\u201d signature. \u201cAfter an initial call to discuss a potential visit, University of Florida representatives were connected to Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s office,\u201d she said. Mr. Murphy did not respond to multiple requests for comment. But he told the campus newspaper that he had also tried to bring Senator Bernie Sanders, the Democratic presidential candidate, to campus, but that Mr. Sanders\u2019s staff had turned the request down. Beth Rotman, the director of money in politics and ethics for the good-government group Common Cause, said the payment appeared to cross the line, and warranted a thorough investigation. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about significant dollars, and public dollars, for a representative of a national political campaign to talk to adults on campus,\u201d Ms. Rotman said, adding that she was glad young people were paying as close attention to their local representatives as federal watchdogs are for the president.",

The group that organized the event, Turning Point USA, had previously canceled the question-and-answer portion of the event because it suspected the far-right group might cause a disturbance. On Sunday, in a raucous scene captured in widely viewed videos, some in the audience yelled and booed during the talk, interrupting Mr. Trump and demanding that he take questions. At one point, when Mr. Trump contended that conservatives do not disrupt liberal speakers on college campuses, one person yelled out, \u201cQ. and A.\u201d Mr. Trump responded by saying that a Q. and A. portion sometimes gets hijacked by those looking for a \u201csound bite.\u201d \u201cYou have some people spreading nonsense, spreading hate to try to take over that room,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the real issue.\u201d More yells followed. Kimberly Guilfoyle, a former Fox News personality who was also speaking at the event, responded, \u201cYou\u2019re not making your parents proud by being rude and disruptive and discourteous.\u201d Ms. Guilfoyle, who is Mr. Trump\u2019s girlfriend, then added, \u201cI bet you engage and go on online dating because you\u2019re impressing no one here to get a date in person.\u201d A spokesman for Mr. Trump declined to comment on Monday. The exchange prompted some to suggest that the far-right group had forced the event, which ran for about 35 minutes, to be cut short. A listing for the event shows it was scheduled to last two hours. The remaining time was allocated for book signings, organizers said. Turning Point USA, a nonprofit conservative youth organization, said in a statement Monday that \u201cit was our organization\u2019s call to cancel the Q. and A. portion days before the event, after we were made aware of a preplanned effort to disrupt the event.\u201d The conflict that unfolded Sunday appeared to stem from an ongoing campaign led by Nicholas J. Fuentes against Turning Point USA. Mr. Fuentes hosts a show called \u201cAmerica First\u201d broadcast on YouTube and other online platforms. He has argued for \u201cChristian nationalism\u201d and against immigration, and has criticized Charlie Kirk, the head of Turning Point USA, over Mr. Kirk\u2019s views on immigration. Mr. Fuentes, who attended the \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017 at which a man who had espoused white supremacist views fatally struck a woman with his car, has said that the First Amendment was not written for Muslims or immigrants, according to The Chicago Tribune, which interviewed Mr. Fuentes in 2017. He has also said that some members of the media should be hanged or sent out of the country for what he determined was intentional false reporting, The Tribune reported. A message left with someone at a number listed for Mr. Fuentes was not immediately returned on Monday. On his show Monday evening, Mr. Fuentes said his intention was not to disrupt the event at U.C.L.A. But he said the demonstration was successful. On Sunday, he wrote on Twitter that the protest was not aimed at Mr. Trump, whom he called a \u201cpatriot.\u201d He said Monday on Twitter that the head of Turning Point USA \u201cis a total failure that continues to be humiliated by real nationalist conservatives.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s lost control of his own events & he has lost the confidence of young Trump supporters,\u201d Mr. Fuentes said. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate Don got swept up in this but thank Kirk for that!\u201d",
