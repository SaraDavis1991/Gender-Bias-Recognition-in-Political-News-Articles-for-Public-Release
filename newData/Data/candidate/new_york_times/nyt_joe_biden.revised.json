      "content": " Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has raised $15.2 million in the past three months, his campaign said Thursday, a drop-off of $7 million from the previous quarter and a sum that falls short of two leading Democratic rivals. Mr. Biden, who began the Democratic presidential primary leading in the polls, has seen his advantage slip, falling behind Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts in several recent polls both nationally and in some early-voting primary states, including Iowa and New Hampshire. His total for the third quarter of the year was another sign of unsteadiness. Several of his opponents released their third-quarter totals earlier this week. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who has a strong small-dollar fund-raising base, pulled in $25.3 million, his campaign said Tuesday, while Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., reported $19.1 million raised during the last three months. Senator Kamala Harris of California raised $11.6 million. Ms. Warren has not yet announced her third-quarter total. The deadline for presidential candidates to file their reports is Oct. 15. Last quarter, Mr. Biden pulled in $22 million, one of the biggest hauls in the field for that time period, though he still fell behind Mr. Buttigieg for that quarter. Mr. Biden announced his total at a fund-raiser Thursday afternoon in Palo Alto, Calif., and the campaign announced it in a news release shortly afterward. His campaign declined to comment when asked about Mr. Biden\u2019s cash on hand. At the fund-raiser, Mr. Biden appeared to take a veiled shot at the views of some of his more liberal opponents as he cautioned against a \u201csocialist\u201d response to President Trump, according to a news media pool report from the event. Mr. Sanders is a democratic socialist. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to share in the benefits,\u201d Mr. Biden said at the fund-raiser, where tickets were offered for $1,500 and $2,800. \u201cThat\u2019s been broken. You don\u2019t need some radical, radical socialist kind of answer to any of this \u2014 you\u2019ve just got to make capitalism work like it\u2019s supposed to work. We\u2019ve got to save capitalism from this guy.\u201d Ms. Warren identifies as a capitalist, though she has called for more far-reaching progressive policies \u2014 Medicare for all, for example \u2014 than Mr. Biden supports. Even before the $15 million figure was released, the Biden campaign and allies were playing down the significance of the quarterly total. One close Biden supporter pointed out the lack of traction that Mr. Sanders and Mr. Buttigieg have had among the broader electorate, as reflected in polling, and said that if money were all that mattered then Democrats would be nominating the billionaire financier Tom Steyer. Also Thursday, Mr. Biden was asked for his thoughts on selecting a running mate. \u201cLook, if I could just manufacture someone out of the blue, I would very much think it\u2019s important to have a woman, and even a woman of color, or someone of color as vice president,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve learned something different. Not different. Something else. The single most important thing you have to have as a president is someone you know is ideologically compatible with you, that you in fact share the same fundamental concerns and values.\u201d The Thursday fund-raiser, and the end of the fund-raising quarter, arrived at an uncertain time for Mr. Biden: The House of Representatives is pursuing an impeachment inquiry against Mr. Trump amid revelations that he asked the president of Ukraine to \u201clook into\u201d Mr. Biden and his son Hunter Biden. There is no evidence that as vice president, Mr. Biden intentionally acted to aid his son\u2019s business dealings there, and the news of Mr. Trump\u2019s actions has outraged Democrats and signaled, to some, that the president is concerned about Mr. Biden\u2019s candidacy. While Mr. Biden is fiercely protective of his family, the moment has thrust the delicate subject into the national spotlight \u2014 even as the question of how voters will respond remains fluid, and some of Mr. Biden\u2019s advisers and allies privately acknowledge the risks associated with Mr. Trump\u2019s focus on the Bidens. That dynamic did not stop his team from fund-raising off the developments involving Mr. Trump. The day after details of the president\u2019s conversation came to light, the campaign tripled its daily online fund-raising average, Mr. Biden\u2019s team said, though an adviser did not respond when asked last week whether that pace had continued. During the final days of the fund-raising quarter, Mr. Biden spent much of his time at high-dollar fund-raisers, often attending two or even three in one day as he visited wealthy enclaves like Bel Air, Calif., and Park City, Utah. Mr. Biden has been more reliant on high-dollar donors than some of his rivals in the Democratic primary: Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders have sworn off big-money fund-raisers. At a fund-raiser in Los Angeles last Thursday, Mr. Biden told attendees that his campaign was close to landing nearly 670,000 donations from about 350,000 people, with an average donation of $46, according to a media pool report of the event. At the time, it wasn\u2019t clear if those remarks were referring to the third-quarter haul or to a cumulative total. The campaign said Thursday that 98 percent of all donations came from grass-roots donors of $200 or less, and said that 56 percent of donors this quarter were new to the campaign.",

      "author": "Nicholas Fandos",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 The House on Monday expanded its sprawling impeachment inquiry, issuing subpoenas to the Defense Department and the Office of Management and Budget for documents that could solve lingering mysteries about whether President Trump\u2019s decision to withhold security aid for Ukraine was tied to his efforts to pressure the government there to investigate his political rivals. The action kicked off what was expected to be another busy week of investigation in Washington, where questions related to Ukraine appear increasingly likely to result in a vote on Mr. Trump\u2019s impeachment. Two senior American diplomats caught up in the scandal are scheduled to speak to investigators before the week is through, while a third who was scheduled to be deposed on Monday failed to show up. And lawmakers appeared to be in the final stages of arranging a highly secure interview with the anonymous C.I.A. whistle-blower whose complaint prompted the inquiry. As three congressional committees pressed forward to determine the validity of the whistle-blower\u2019s complaint, which accused Mr. Trump of hijacking American foreign policy for his political benefit, the president sounded defiant and continued to lash out at his accusers. \u201cPeople understand it\u2019s a fraud, it\u2019s a scam, it\u2019s a witch hunt, and all we do is keep fighting for the American people because that\u2019s all I do,\u201d Mr. Trump said Monday evening at the White House. He called his actions \u201cvery terrific.\u201d But there were also signs of continued Republican uneasiness with his statements and actions. Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, who had previously raised concerns about the withheld aid money, chastised Mr. Trump on Monday for soliciting foreign assistance for his own political purposes, though he added that he did not view the conduct as impeachable. \u201cThe president should not have raised the Biden issue on that call, period,\u201d Mr. Portman told The Columbus Dispatch. \u201cIt\u2019s not appropriate for a president to engage a foreign government in an investigation of a political opponent.\u201d With the new subpoenas issued on Monday, the House was trying to unearth communications and other records that might shed light on two enduring questions at the center of the impeachment inquiry: why the White House decided last summer to abruptly suspend the $391 million aid package to Ukraine, and whether it was connected to contemporaneous efforts by Mr. Trump and his personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, to pressure the country to investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and other Democrats. The subpoenas, issued by the Democrat-controlled House Intelligence Committee, follow similar demands for documents from the State Department and the White House made in recent days. They gave the agencies until Oct. 15 to hand over notes, memos and communications related to the aid, deliberations over its delivery within the government, and possible conversations with Ukrainian officials about it. Mr. Trump personally ordered his staff to freeze the aid just days before a now infamous July call in which he asked President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to do him \u201ca favor\u201d and help investigate Mr. Biden and a conspiracy theory about Ukrainian meddling in the 2016 election. He lifted a block on its delivery in September only under intense bipartisan pressure from Congress, where lawmakers view the money as vital to combating Russia\u2019s armed aggression in the region. The White House has denied that the aid was being withheld to exert leverage over the Ukrainians, but at least one senior diplomat worried privately that that was precisely what was happening, and the administration has been unwilling to answer questions about the timeline and rationale for the decision. Regardless of the reasoning, the decision to withhold aid that was allocated by Congress on a bipartisan basis prompted confusion and concern within the State and Defense Departments, which were responsible for delivering the money, as well as among lawmakers in both parties who had a hand in allocating it. Democrats leading the impeachment inquiry in the House suspect the actions may be related. They point to comments in early September by Vice President Mike Pence, who said publicly that a review of the funds was based on White House concerns about \u201cissues of corruption.\u201d \u201cThe enclosed subpoena demands documents that are necessary for the committees to examine this sequence of these events and the reasons behind the White House\u2019s decision to withhold critical military assistance to Ukraine that was appropriated by Congress to counter Russian aggression,\u201d read the letters accompanying the subpoenas, signed by Representative Adam B. Schiff, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee; Representative Elijah E. Cummings, the chairman of the Oversight and Reform Committee; and Representative Eliot L. Engel, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. The Defense Department had been anticipating a subpoena. Last week, the Pentagon\u2019s general counsel directed all department heads to collect and turn in all documents and material related to military aid to Ukraine. \u201cAs we\u2019ve stated previously, we are prepared to work with Congress and other relevant parties on questions related to the issue of Ukrainian aid as appropriate,\u201d Lt. Col. Carla M. Gleason, a Pentagon spokeswoman, said on Monday. The budget office did not reply to a request for comment. The House Appropriations and Budget Committees are reviewing some documents produced by the budget office in response to a separate request the two committees sent in late September about the delay in the foreign aid, aides said on Monday. As the subpoenas stack up, the impeachment inquiry is gaining steam less than three weeks after House leaders opened it. The White House has threatened to try to stonewall investigators\u2019 requests, and Mr. Trump has mounted a near round-the-clock defense of himself. But witnesses have steadily begun to produce documentary evidence \u2014 some of which has bolstered the initial complaint \u2014 and a spate of private witness depositions are expected in the coming weeks. The Intelligence Committee also appears to be close to conducting an interview with the whistle-blower himself. The precise format of the meeting, though, remains a matter of deliberation as Democrats seek to protect the identity of the official \u2014 possibly even from congressional Republicans. Whistle-blowers\u2019 disclosures are protected under the law, and their identities are typically carefully guarded. But Mr. Trump has forcefully attacked the whistle-blower, called his actions treason and demanded to learn his identity to \u201cmeet my accuser.\u201d Democrats fear Mr. Trump\u2019s allies on their committee could try to feed details about the official\u2019s identity to the White House or to the public, putting the whistle-blower in danger. In addition to logistics, the committee has been waiting for lawyers representing the whistle-blower to receive the requisite security clearances to participate in a congressional interview. Mark S. Zaid, one of the whistle-blower\u2019s lawyers, said on Monday that two of the three have now done so and a third is close to completing the process, meaning an interview could be scheduled as soon as late this week. It was unclear whether the lawyers would seek to arrange an interview with Congress and a second intelligence official whom they now represent, and who they said could corroborate parts of the whistle-blower\u2019s claims. The investigating committees had scheduled a deposition for Monday with George P. Kent, a deputy assistant secretary of state and Ukraine expert, but Mr. Kent did not show up as planned. A committee aide said that conversations about scheduling a new date with Mr. Kent were continuing, and implied that at least three other witnesses scheduled to appear this week were also in doubt. Mr. Kent is the head of the State Department\u2019s bureau of European and Eurasian affairs, but he served until 2018 as a top American diplomat in Ukraine. The three others are T. Ulrich Brechbuhl, the State Department\u2019s counselor who the whistle-blower said listened in on the July phone call, and Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, associates of Mr. Giuliani, who aided his attempts to gin up investigations in Ukraine. John M. Dowd, a lawyer for Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman, wrote to the Intelligence Committee last week that its requests for documents were \u201coverly broad and unduly burdensome\u201d and that its proposed timeline for document production and witness interviews was unreasonable. He accused Democrats of trying to \u201charass, intimidate and embarrass my clients\u201d but did not rule out that they would cooperate. The committee aide said that if Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman failed to comply, they would receive subpoenas compelling them to do so \u201cin short order.\u201d Still, two key figures from the State Department were confirmed to participate in their scheduled depositions. Gordon D. Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union who was deeply involved in Mr. Trump\u2019s policy toward Ukraine, is expected to speak to investigators on Tuesday. And on Friday, they will question Marie L. Yovanovitch, the former American ambassador to Ukraine who was recalled from her post in May after she was deemed not to be sufficiently supportive of Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda there.",

      "author": "Peter Baker",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 One day in October 1992, four Republican congressmen showed up in the Oval Office with an audacious recommendation. President George Bush was losing his re-election race, and they told him the only way to win was to hammer his challenger Bill Clinton\u2019s patriotism for protesting the Vietnam War while in London and visiting Moscow as a young man. Mr. Bush was largely on board with that approach. But what came next crossed the line, as far as he and his team were concerned. \u201cThey wanted us to contact the Russians or the British to seek information on Bill Clinton\u2019s trip to Moscow,\u201d James A. Baker III, Mr. Bush\u2019s White House chief of staff, wrote in a memo later that day. \u201cI said we absolutely could not do that.\u201d President Trump insists he and his attorney general did nothing wrong by seeking damaging information about his domestic opponents from Ukraine, Australia, Italy and Britain or by publicly calling on China to investigate his most prominent Democratic challenger. But for every other White House in the modern era, Republican and Democratic, the idea of enlisting help from foreign powers for political advantage was seen as unwise and politically dangerous, if not unprincipled. A survey of 10 former White House chiefs of staff under Presidents Ronald Reagan, Bush, Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama found that none recalled any circumstance under which the White House had solicited or accepted political help from other countries, and all said they would have considered the very idea out of bounds. \u201cI served three presidents in the White House and don\u2019t remember even hearing any speculation to consider asking for such action,\u201d said Andrew H. Card Jr., who ran the younger Mr. Bush\u2019s White House and was the longest-serving chief of staff in the last six decades. William M. Daley, who served as commerce secretary under Mr. Clinton and chief of staff under Mr. Obama, said if someone had even proposed such an action, he probably would \u201crecommend the person be escorted out of\u201d the White House, then fired and reported to ethics officials. Other chiefs were just as definitive. \u201cDid not happen on Reagan\u2019s watch. Would not have happened on Reagan\u2019s watch,\u201d said Kenneth M. Duberstein, his last chief of staff. \u201cI would have shut him down,\u201d said Leon E. Panetta, who served as Mr. Clinton\u2019s chief of staff and Mr. Obama\u2019s defense secretary. The sense of incredulity among White House veterans in recent days crossed party and ideological lines. \u201cThis is unprecedented,\u201d said Samuel K. Skinner, who preceded Mr. Baker as chief of staff under Mr. Bush. Other chiefs who said they never encountered such a situation included Thomas F. McLarty III and John D. Podesta (Clinton) and Rahm Emanuel, Denis R. McDonough and Jacob J. Lew (Obama). History has shown that foreign affairs can be treacherous for presidents, even just the suspicion of mixing politics with the national interest. As a candidate in 1968, Richard M. Nixon sought to forestall a Vietnam peace deal by President Lyndon B. Johnson just before the election. Associates of Mr. Reagan were accused of trying to delay the release of hostages by Iran when he was a candidate in 1980 for fear that it would aid President Jimmy Carter, but a bipartisan House investigation concluded that there was no merit to the charge. Mr. Clinton faced months of investigation over 1996 campaign contributions from Chinese interests tied to the Beijing government. In none of those cases did an incumbent president personally apply pressure to foreign powers to damage political opponents. Mr. Trump pressed Ukraine\u2019s president this summer to investigate involvement with Democrats in 2016 and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. while holding up $391 million in American aid. Mr. Trump has said he was simply investigating corruption, not trying to benefit himself. \u201cThe right way to look at it is the vice president was selling our country out,\u201d Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, said in an interview on Sunday. Mr. Trump was fulfilling his duty, he said. \u201cI don\u2019t see what the president did wrong.\u201d Mr. Giuliani has been leading Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to dig up evidence of corruption by the Democrats in Ukraine, meeting with various officials and negotiating a commitment by the newly installed government in Kiev to investigate conspiracy theories about Ukrainian involvement in the 2016 election and supposed conflicts of interest by Mr. Biden. Told that past White House chiefs of staff said any legitimate allegations should be handled by the Justice Department, not the president, Mr. Giuliani said: \u201cThat\u2019s if you can trust the Justice Department. My witnesses don\u2019t trust the Justice Department, and they don\u2019t trust the F.B.I.\u201d He added that he would not have either until Attorney General William P. Barr took over. Mr. Barr has contacted foreign officials for help in investigating the origin of the special counsel investigation by Robert S. Mueller III into Russian interference and ties with Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, part of an effort to prove that the whole matter was a \u201choax,\u201d as the president has insisted. Mr. Trump defends himself by saying that other presidents have leaned on foreign governments for help. That is true, but when other presidents have pressured counterparts and even held up American assistance to coerce cooperation, it has generally been to achieve certain policy goals \u2014 not to advance the president\u2019s personal or political agenda. As an example, Mr. Trump often cites Mr. Obama, who was overheard telling President Dmitri Medvedev of Russia in 2012 that he would have more \u201cmore flexibility\u201d to negotiate missile defense after the fall election. While that may be objectionable, it is not the same thing as asking a foreign government to intervene in an American election. \u201cThey assume everybody\u2019s as sleazy and dirty as they are, which is not the case,\u201d Mr. Emanuel said. Mr. Trump points to Mr. Biden, arguing that the former vice president was the one who abused his power by threatening to withhold $1 billion in American aid to Ukraine unless it fired its prosecutor general. Mr. Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden served on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company, earning $50,000 a month. The company\u2019s oligarch owner, Mykola Zlochevsky, had been a subject of cases overseen by the prosecutor, and so Mr. Trump contends that Mr. Biden sought the prosecutor\u2019s ouster to benefit his son. As a matter of appearances, at least, the former vice president\u2019s family left him open to suspicion. Even some of his defenders say it was unseemly for Hunter Biden to seemingly trade on his family name. The elder Mr. Biden has said he never discussed his son\u2019s business dealings in Ukraine with him, but some Democrats suggest he should have if only to prevent just such a situation from arising. For all of that, however, no evidence has emerged that Mr. Biden moved to push out the prosecutor to benefit his son. No memo or text message has become public linking the two. None of the American officials who were involved at the time have come forward alleging any connection. No whistle-blower has filed a complaint. In pressing for the prosecutor\u2019s ouster, Mr. Biden was carrying out Mr. Obama\u2019s policy as developed by his national security team and coordinated with European allies and the International Monetary Fund, all of which considered the Ukrainian prosecutor to be deliberately overlooking corruption. Indeed, at the time Mr. Biden acted, there was no public evidence that the prosecutor\u2019s office was actively pursuing investigations of Burisma, although Mr. Zlochevsky\u2019s allies say the prosecutor continued to use the threat of prosecution to try to solicit bribes from the oligarch and his team. The 1992 episode involving Mr. Bush and Mr. Baker provides an intriguing case study in the way previous administrations have viewed seeking political help overseas. At the time, Mr. Bush was trailing in the polls and eager for any weapon to turn things around. Representatives Robert K. Dornan, Duncan Hunter and Duke Cunningham of California and Sam Johnson of Texas urged the president to ask Russia and Britain for help. Mr. Dornan, reached last week, said Mr. Baker offered no objections during the meeting. \u201cBaker sat there in the Oval Office like a bump on a log,\u201d he recalled. \u201cHe said nothing.\u201d If Mr. Baker advised Mr. Bush not to reach out to foreign governments, then he did so after the congressmen had left, Mr. Dornan said. Mr. Dornan said that was a mistake and that Mr. Bush should have done as Mr. Trump has. \u201cThe bottom line from me was, \u2018If you don\u2019t do this, Mr. President, leader of the free world, you will lose,\u2019\u201d Mr. Dornan said. \u201cAnd he didn\u2019t do it and he lost. Baker cost Bush that second term.\u201d As it was, Mr. Baker and some of his aides got in trouble anyway because State Department employees searched Mr. Clinton\u2019s passport file to determine whether he had ever tried to renounce his American citizenship. They found no such evidence, but an independent counsel was appointed to investigate whether the search violated any laws. The attorney general who requested the investigation? Mr. Barr, in his first tour running the Justice Department. The independent counsel who was appointed? Joseph diGenova, a lawyer now helping Mr. Giuliani look for information in Ukraine. In the passport case, Mr. diGenova concluded that no laws had been broken and that he should never have been appointed in first place. As for seeking help from Russia and Britain, Mr. Baker declined to comment last week, but his peers said he did exactly as they would have. \u201cIt would have been ludicrous at that stage to do anything,\u201d Mr. Skinner said. \u201cBaker\u2019s decision was obviously the right one.\u201d",

      "content": " ERIE, Pa. \u2014 Mark Graham, a real estate appraiser in this faded manufacturing hub, sat with friends at a gym named FitnessU on the morning after the Democratic debate in mid-September. He had voted for Barack Obama, but in 2016 he took a gamble on Donald Trump. Although he called the president\u2019s conduct in office \u201ca joke,\u201d he was unwilling to commit to voting Democratic in 2020, unconvinced by the 10 party hopefuls the night before. Jump ahead to October and Democrats in Congress are investigating evidence of President Trump\u2019s possible abuse of power. Mr. Graham has had an electoral conversion. \u201cThings have changed in the last couple weeks: More stupidity has come out,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Graham, 69, said in a telephone interview last week. He hopes Democrats nominate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., but he is not particular. \u201cI\u2019d vote for the Democratic nominee no matter who it is at this point,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Mr. Trump gets into another four years, where he\u2019s a lame duck, it\u2019s going to be like adding gasoline to the fire.\u201d [How did \u2018never Trump\u2019 Republicans become some of the president\u2019s strongest defenders?] Heading into 2020, there is intense focus among campaign strategists on the weakest element of the Trump coalition: the millions of voters who disapproved of both major candidates in 2016 but took a chance on Mr. Trump. Whether an impeachment inquiry moves Obama-Trump voters like Mr. Graham off the fence, one way or the other, is a major narrative arc in the 2020 script that is rapidly unfolding and updating. Erie County in western Pennsylvania holds a wealth of these conflicted voters. That much was clear in interviews conducted in the days after the 2016 election, and it\u2019s clear now. Mr. Trump won an upset national victory by carrying places just like Erie County, long a blue-collar Democratic stronghold; he won here thanks to a 17-point swing from Mr. Obama\u2019s margin of victory in 2012. The area\u2019s flip from blue to red was a microcosm of how Mr. Trump pulled off narrow victories in this state as well as in Michigan and Wisconsin. In interviews in Erie last month, before the impeachment inquiry began, many of the Trump voters from 2016 were either supportive of the president or unpersuaded by the Democratic alternatives. But reached by phone after the inquiry was announced, some of these voters had changed their minds. Outright conversions like Mr. Graham\u2019s, while still rare, were reflected in an uptick of support for impeachment by independent voters in recent national polls. \u201cI don\u2019t know which way the impeachment issue is going to cause public opinion to move,\u201d said Joseph Morris, a political scientist at Mercyhurst University in Erie, who was polling local voters when news of the impeachment inquiry broke. \u201cUndoubtedly a majority of voters that voted for Trump will vote for him again in 2020,\u201d Mr. Morris said. \u201cBut I think the jury is still out when it comes to those independents or any Democrats who chose to vote for Trump in 2016.\u201d Two strong predictors of a president\u2019s re-election odds \u2014 support for his handling of the economy and voters\u2019 overall approval \u2014 are pulling in opposite directions in Mr. Morris\u2019s latest survey of Erie County, which suggests a close election in this battleground county in a battleground state. Approval of Mr. Trump overall is dismal at 38 percent, but 52 percent approve of the way he\u2019s handling the economy. [Keep up with the 2020 field with our candidate tracker.] Obama-Trump voters like Mr. Graham totaled some 6.7 million people in 2016, according to the results of the Cooperative Congressional Election Study, a large survey conducted before and after elections. Of the nearly one in five voters who disapproved of both major 2016 candidates, Mr. Trump won by a 17-point margin. Another large study of nearly 7,000 voters in January 2019 found that Obama-Trump voters were the only slice of the electorate whose approval of Mr. Trump has significantly eroded. \u201cEven small movement among these voters \u2014 who represented 5 percent of voters in 2016 \u2014 may prove significant heading into the 2020 presidential election,\u201d wrote one of the election scholars behind the study. Mark Miller, the third-generation owner of Miller Brothers\u2019 lawn and garden supply store in Erie, is a longtime Republican who cast a grudging vote for Mr. Trump. We met last month for breakfast at Dominick\u2019s, the same 24-hour restaurant downtown where I interviewed him in 2016. Mr. Miller said at the time the likelihood he would vote Democratic in 2020 was \u201c50-50.\u201d And he was still \u201c50-50\u201d when we spoke this month. Among the Democratic candidates he could potentially support, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey impressed him as a happy warrior on the campaign trail. He liked Mr. Biden because he was not promising the moon. \u201cI gave the other guy a shot,\u201d Mr. Miller said of the president. \u201cI don\u2019t like the way he talks to people. I don\u2019t like what he\u2019s doing internally with the cabinet. I don\u2019t think anybody feels comfortable that we have anything cohesive at the top right now.\u201d A small-business owner with about 20 employees, Mr. Miller, 55, calls himself \u201ca really conservative family guy,\u201d who sent four children to Catholic schools. He was not ready in September to say he would vote Democratic, and the impeachment inquiry has not changed his mind. \u201cTalking to people coming through the doors daily, there\u2019s information overload and they\u2019re not sure what to believe,\u201d he said last week, speaking from his store after closing hours. He said it was wrong for the president to ask a foreign country, Ukraine, to investigate a political rival, Mr. Biden. But he added, \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s egregious enough to warrant full impeachment.\u201d He continued, \u201cI\u2019d like to see everybody get back to work on the business of the country.\u201d Lyne Daniels, a 52-year-old Obama-Trump voter in Erie, said congressional Democrats should be working with the president on issues like health care and immigration. \u201cAll they\u2019re doing is, Get Trump, Get Trump, Get Trump,\u201d she said of the impeachment inquiry. Ms. Daniels, who works both as a municipal secretary and for a clothing store, knows exactly who she\u2019ll vote for in 2020: Mr. Trump. She said the president had fulfilled his promises to put \u201cAmerica First\u201d by avoiding foreign wars and ending decades of what she called open borders. [Trump\u2019s unfounded allegations about Biden and his son have been the biggest campaign challenge to the former vice president yet.] Ms. Daniels said she voted for Mr. Obama twice because he faced Republicans she disliked and regarded as members of the establishment. She called Senator John McCain, the 2008 nominee, \u201ca traitor to this country,\u201d adding, \u201cI\u2019ve done my own research.\u201d Even fans of Mr. Trump often say they wish he would lay off Twitter. Not Ms. Daniels, who called it a \u201cbrilliant\u201d diversionary tactic. \u201cHe plays you, the press, like a fiddle, and you fall for it every time,\u201d she said. \u201cHe gets everybody talking and it sucks up airtime for days. Meanwhile over in the corner, we\u2019re working on this thing nobody knows about.\u201d Asked about Mr. Trump\u2019s thousands of documented falsehoods in office, Ms. Daniels pushed back. \u201cBased on whose sources?\u201d she demanded. \u201cJust because the news tells me that his claims are false is a little hypocritical because we had to listen about Russia, Russia, Russia for two years, and they were wrong. Who are they to say what\u2019s coming out of his mouth is wrong?\u201d In the 2018 midterms, Democrats did well in the three Pennsylvania counties that Mr. Trump had flipped: Erie, Luzerne and Northampton. Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, carried all three. Ron DiNicola, a Democrat running for Congress, won Erie County by 20 points, though he lost the race because rural counties in the district voted Republican. \u201cI feel like our country has been more divided than ever,\u2019\u2019 said Stephanie Johnson, 38, a substitute teacher and registered Libertarian in Erie County. \u201cI see it just being a mom, being out and about, at the grocery store, after school. I feel like people are so angry nowadays.\u201d Ms. Johnson worries that a decline in attendance at her family\u2019s church is related to the divisiveness of America under Mr. Trump, whom she has no interest in voting for in 2020. \u201cI feel like there are a lot of people who aren\u2019t putting their full trust and faith in God, and are sort of scared and angry about what\u2019s going on in the world,\u201d she said. A president with no self-restraint on how he speaks about others has spread coarseness, Ms. Johnson said. \u201cLike, it\u2019s just gotten to the point where nobody has any compassion for each other.\u201d Still, Ryan Bizzarro, a Democratic state representative from Erie County, said, \u201cIf this economy holds on,\u201d Mr. Trump \u201cis going to be tough to beat.\u201d Republicans \u201chave been able to hijack our narrative because we\u2019re so focused on a lot of the social issues \u2014 which are important, but people are voting again with their wallets,\u201d Mr. Bizzarro said last month. Once a city reliant on heavy industry, Erie is moving past the stereotype of Rust Belt decrepitude. Its largest employer was once a General Electric plant making locomotives but is now Erie Insurance. Lost manufacturing jobs are being replaced by start-ups making computer and electronic parts. Mr. Bizzarro, 33, was skeptical that Mr. Biden would end up as the nominee. If Democrats nominate one of his two closest current rivals, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts or Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Mr. Bizzarro sounded leery of their ability to carry Erie County without a surge of voters from his own generation. Millennials, whose turnout continues to lag older voters, \u201cdamn well better show up for the election,\u201d he said.",

Vogel, Matina Stevis-Gridneff and Andrew E. KramerPRINT EDITIONPerry\u2019s Focus on Gas Company During Trip Entangles Him in Ukraine Case|October 8, 2019, Page A14",
      "author": "Kenneth P. Vogel",
      "content": "   WASHINGTON \u2014 When Energy Secretary Rick Perry led an American delegation to the inauguration of Ukraine\u2019s new president in May, he took the opportunity to suggest the names of Americans the new Ukrainian government might want to advise and oversee the country\u2019s state-owned gas company. Mr. Perry\u2019s focus during the trip on Ukraine\u2019s energy industry was in keeping with a push he had begun months earlier under the previous Ukrainian president, and it was consistent with United States policy of promoting anti-corruption efforts in Ukraine and greater energy independence from Russia. But his actions during the trip have entangled him in a controversy about a pressure campaign waged by President Trump and his allies directed at the new Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, that is at the center of the impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump. That effort sought to pressure Mr. Zelensky\u2019s government to investigate Mr. Trump\u2019s rivals, including former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., a leading contender for the Democratic presidential nomination to challenge Mr. Trump. Mr. Perry\u2019s trip raised questions about whether he was seeking to provide certain Americans help in gaining a foothold in the Ukrainian energy business at a time when the new Ukrainian government was looking to the United States for signals of support in its simmering conflict with Russia. Mr. Trump seemed to suggest last week that he made a July 25 phone call to Mr. Zelensky, during which he repeatedly urged his Ukrainian counterpart to pursue investigations that could politically benefit him, at the urging of Mr. Perry. Mr. Trump told congressional Republicans last week that Mr. Perry wanted him to discuss the liquefied natural gas supply with Mr. Zelensky, Axios reported. That topic did not specifically come up in the call between the two leaders, according to the reconstructed transcript released by the White House. Text messages released last week by House investigators showed that other officials were suggesting that the president speak with Mr. Zelensky to nail down an agreement for Ukraine to move ahead with the investigations being sought by Mr. Trump. At a news conference on Monday in Vilnius, Lithuania, where he was meeting with Ukrainian and Polish energy officials, Mr. Perry said he asked Mr. Trump \u201cmultiple times\u201d to hold a phone call with Mr. Zelensky. Mr. Perry\u2019s role in the diplomacy between the countries highlights the degree to which Mr. Trump entrusted his Ukraine policy to an ad hoc coalition of loyalists inside and outside the government, especially after the recall of the ambassador to Ukraine amid questions among Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters about her loyalty to the president. It also reveals the extent to which Ukrainian politics and national security revolve around energy supplies. Mr. Perry\u2019s efforts, while broadly consistent with American national security and energy objectives, intersected with those of the figures involved in the pressure campaign. Two American diplomats who attended Mr. Zelensky\u2019s inauguration with Mr. Perry \u2014 Gordon D. Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union, and Kurt D. Volker, then the State Department\u2019s special envoy to Ukraine \u2014 pushed Mr. Zelensky to publicly commit to the investigations and were involved in setting up the call between Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky. They appeared to work on the effort with Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer and a leading force in the campaign to pressure the Ukrainian government to pursue the investigations. Two associates of Mr. Giuliani also sought changes to the leadership of the Ukrainian state-owned gas company, Naftogaz. Those changes would have required approval from a supervisory board Mr. Perry sought to shape. One of Mr. Giuliani\u2019s associates, Lev Parnas, pitched a liquefied natural gas deal to the chief executive of Naftogaz in early spring, as The New York Times reported last month. The deal was rejected by the Naftogaz executive. But Mr. Parnas and a partner who was also involved in Mr. Giuliani\u2019s political efforts in Ukraine, Igor Fruman, also sought to install a presumptive ally as Naftogaz\u2019s chief executive. They told a gas executive named Andrey Favorov that they could use their American political connections to help him become chief executive of Naftogaz, suggesting that, if appointed, he might steer the company to buy liquefied natural gas from them, according to Dale Perry, the managing partner of a company that competes with one run by Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman. Mr. Favorov, who is a lower-ranking executive at Naftogaz, rejected the proposal, which was first reported by The Associated Press. Dale Perry, who is not related to the energy secretary, said he found it \u201cvery troubling and disturbing\u201d that Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman boasted that they had worked with Mr. Giuliani to force the recall this spring of the American ambassador to Ukraine, Marie L. Yovanovitch. But people in Ukraine and the United States who are familiar with the conversations said the Ukrainian government had requested recommendations from Mr. Perry for Americans who could advise Naftogaz and the government on governance reforms and liquefied natural gas transportation. Mr. Perry recommended four Americans as possible advisers on energy issues, according to the Americans and Ukrainians who are familiar with the conversations. Names floated included Carlos Pascual, a former American ambassador to Ukraine, and Daniel Yergin, an author and energy expert who has worked with Mr. Pascual at an energy advisory firm. Mr. Perry, a former governor of Texas, specifically recommended two Texas-based investors who work in Ukraine, Michael Bleyzer and Robert Bensh, for a supervisory board of Naftogaz, according to the Americans and Ukrainians familiar with the conversations. Mr. Bleyzer, a Republican donor, has proposed gas deals with Naftogaz, according to people familiar with his efforts. Shaylyn Hynes, a spokeswoman for the Energy Department, said in a statement on Monday night that Mr. Perry \u201chas consistently called for the modernization and reform of Kiev\u2019s business and energy sector in an effort to create an environment that will incentivize Western companies to do business in Ukraine.\u201d As part of that effort, and at the request of Mr. Zelensky\u2019s administration, Ms. Hynes said Mr. Perry \u201crecommended the names of some widely respected individuals in the American energy sector, including government experts\u201d at the Energy Department. But, she said Mr. Perry \u201cdid not recommend these individuals be placed on any board.\u201d Nonetheless, the circulation of the names of Mr. Bleyzer and Mr. Bensh as possible Naftogaz appointments led to speculation that Naftogaz was considering removing from the supervisory board a former Obama administration official named Amos J. Hochstein. Mr. Hochstein had worked with Mr. Biden on his Ukraine efforts as vice president. That imbued the discussion about the board appointments with political overtones at a time when Democrats were beginning to build an impeachment case around the actions of Mr. Trump and his team to press Ukraine to investigate Mr. Biden and his son, who had served on the board of a private Ukrainian gas company. Adding to the complexity of the situation: When Mr. Zelensky dispatched one of his top aides to Washington in July to meet with members of Congress and the Trump administration, and to try to connect with Mr. Giuliani, some of the meetings on Capitol Hill were arranged by a Naftogaz lobbyist, and attended by a Naftogaz official. Naftogaz, until just a few years ago a money-losing monopoly stained by corruption, has been substantially overhauled in recent years to survive without Russian gas and to compete in the European Union market. To comply with European Union regulations and be able to sell Ukrainian gas to the bloc\u2019s energy-hungry countries, the company has been weaning itself off subsidies and spinning off its gas-transmission operations into a new entity with a guaranteed income of at least $2 billion a year. Naftogaz officials said that this company, which will come into existence in January, and Naftogaz\u2019s operations storing gas underground could attract American investments, and that they were at the heart of what the United States administration was interested in. Naftogaz officials said the American interest was sufficient that Mr. Sondland held further discussions about the planned spinoff of the transmission operations in Brussels.",

      "author": "Jonathan Martin",
      "content": "   WASHINGTON \u2014 Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s presidential campaign was under attack, and he and his advisers were torn over what to do. For more than a week, President Trump had been hurling unfounded accusations about Mr. Biden, his son Hunter and their dealings in Ukraine. Mr. Biden and his advisers debated whether to mount a fierce counterattack or to stick to a set of policy arguments he had been planning to roll out. Bad news loomed in the background: Mr. Biden\u2019s poll numbers had already grown wobbly, his fund-raising was uneven, and cable news was flashing chyrons by the hour showing Mr. Trump\u2019s wild claims. Mr. Biden himself was equivocating: He wanted to defend and protect his son, but he also believed the president was baiting him into a dirty fight. And as a lifelong adherent to congressional tradition, Mr. Biden was wary of acting hastily as an impeachment inquiry was getting underway. The strain grew so acute that some of Mr. Biden\u2019s advisers lashed out at their own party, taking the unusual step of urging campaign surrogates to criticize the Democratic National Committee \u2014 a neutral body in the primary \u2014 for not doing more to defend Mr. Biden, while the Republican National Committee was running TV ads attacking him. Frustrated, D.N.C. officials informed the Biden camp that it would continue denouncing Mr. Trump but would not run ads for Mr. Biden or any other candidate. The Biden campaign\u2019s tense deliberations reached a climax last weekend when Mr. Biden agreed to give a scorching rebuttal to Mr. Trump in a speech on Wednesday in Reno, Nev. But he delivered it well into the evening on the East Coast, and it was mostly lost amid another long day of Trumpian eruptions. To some Biden allies, it seemed too little too late: a case study in political indecision. Now Mr. Biden looks more vulnerable than at any point since he entered the campaign. Facing one of the greatest challenges of his candidacy, Mr. Biden has plainly struggled to meet the moment, or fully reconcile his own cautious instincts with his protectiveness of his family\u2019s privacy and his preference for taking the moral high road against Mr. Trump. Interviews with more than 50 Democratic strategists, lawmakers and lobbyists provide a portrait of a candidacy facing challenges on all sides, and one at risk of losing its core argument that Mr. Biden is the Democrat best able to defeat Mr. Trump in a general election. There is no evidence behind Mr. Trump\u2019s claim that Mr. Biden intervened inappropriately with Ukraine to help his son, but Democrats have been unnerved by the president\u2019s onslaught and Mr. Biden\u2019s halting response.  In addition to the attacks from Mr. Trump, Mr. Biden\u2019s top rivals, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, each out-raised him in the third quarter by about $10 million. And as Ms. Warren has emerged as Mr. Biden\u2019s most formidable competition, Mr. Sanders, her main challenger for progressive support, just had  a heart attack, casting uncertainty over whether he could siphon votes from Ms. Warren, as the Biden camp had hoped. Even before last week, Mr. Biden\u2019s advisers were acknowledging to donors that he may well lose both of the leadoff nominating contests in Iowa and New Hampshire. His communications aides contend that most voters were more focused on what Mr. Trump did to prompt the impeachment inquiry than on the false claims themselves. And they pointed to the former vice president\u2019s forceful attacks on Mr. Trump at a news conference Friday to argue that he was now ready to do battle with the president. \u201cThis guy like all bullies is a coward,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cHe does not want to run against me.\u201d On Thursday, Mr. Biden, whose inner monologue rarely remains repressed, gave voice to the tension he is struggling with as he spoke at a fund-raiser in Palo Alto, Calif. Recalling the difficulty Hillary Clinton had in confronting Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign style, Mr. Biden worried about being \u201csucked into the trap of the stuff that Trump was laying. He wants you in a mud fight.\u201d \u201cBut when you respond to that,\u201d he continued, \u201cit brings you back down into that.\u201d Mr. Biden was even blunter, and angrier, in private after news first emerged that Mr. Trump had exhorted the Ukrainian government to investigate him and his son. \u201cI can\u2019t believe this guy is going after my family like this,\u201d he told Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, as the two campaigned in Iowa, Mr. Coons recalled. [Sign up for our politics newsletter hosted by Lisa Lerer and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race.] Leading Democrats have been pleading privately with Mr. Biden and his top aides to aggressively confront Mr. Trump, and expressing impatience with them for not seizing this opportunity to engage him in a two-man race. After all, Mr. Biden had spent months framing his candidacy as a singular crusade to oust an aberrant president. \u201cIt\u2019s time to really respond so everybody hears it,\u201d said Representative Cedric Richmond of Louisiana, a campaign co-chairman. \u201cIf someone says something enough, people will start to believe it, and this president gets in his zone of telling a lie over and over again. You have to make sure people don\u2019t believe in it.\u201d David Plouffe, former President Barack Obama\u2019s campaign manager, was mystified. Mr. Biden \u201cshould use this moment and become Trump\u2019s opponent,\u201d Mr. Plouffe said. \u201cI don\u2019t understand it.\u201d But Mr. Biden is confronting an almost unimaginable situation: the president he hopes to challenge is facing impeachment for urging another country to help smear him. What\u2019s more, the House inquiry centers on what Mr. Biden values most in his private and public life: protecting his family and honoring institutional norms. Several Democrats close to Mr. Biden say he did not take on Mr. Trump sooner in large part because of his reverence for congressional prerogatives \u2014 he did not want to immediately insert himself into the House\u2019s jurisdiction. But Mr. Biden also sought to address the attacks on his son on his own terms rather than sit for hastily arranged television interviews that would have forced him to answer questions about Hunter Biden\u2019s work that few of his own aides dared pose. Now, just as his monthslong lead in the primary is eroding, he faces an opponent who\u2019s threatening his son, the political system he dedicated his adult life to and, as he approaches his 77th birthday, his last chance to become president. For Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign, no attack could have been more difficult to deal with than one involving the candidate\u2019s son. Mr. Biden nearly did not run for president because of the effect it would have on his family \u2014 and particularly on Hunter Biden and his children, according to multiple advisers to the former vice president. Hunter Biden has struggled for years with substance addiction and had recently gone through a very public divorce from his first wife. In separate interviews, Mr. Coons and his fellow senator from Delaware, Tom Carper, both said they had warned Mr. Biden that the president would target his family. \u201cHe expected his family to be attacked,\u201d Mr. Carper said, adding that Mr. Biden assured him he was braced for \u201cthe onslaught.\u2019\u2019 Mr. Biden\u2019s family, including his son, encouraged him to enter the race, knowing the attacks were inevitable. But as Anita Dunn, one of Mr. Biden\u2019s closest advisers, put it: \u201cWhen it happens, it still feels pretty lousy.\u201d The Biden campaign has attempted to handle the candidate\u2019s son with great sensitivity. Mr. Biden made clear at the outset that Hunter, a lawyer who had long advised his father on his campaigns, should not be made to feel excluded, people who spoke with him said. One adviser to Mr. Biden recently telephoned his son to solicit advice on the upcoming debate in Ohio. But to most of Mr. Biden\u2019s aides, Hunter Biden has been a spectral presence. He is living in Los Angeles and stayed away from Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign launch in Philadelphia. Hunter Biden quietly attended the last two debates and appeared with his new wife, Melissa Cohen, at a July fund-raiser in Pasadena, Calif. Still, Mr. Biden\u2019s advisers are aware that Hunter Biden carries political vulnerabilities. His business career has intersected repeatedly with his father\u2019s political power, through roles he had held in banking, lobbying and international finance. Working for a Ukrainian energy company beginning in 2014, he was paid as much as $50,000 a month while his father was vice president, and some of Mr. Biden\u2019s admirers worry that, while Mr. Trump\u2019s accusations are without merit, voters may view Hunter Biden\u2019s actions as problematic. Even one of Mr. Biden\u2019s Democratic rivals, Beto O\u2019Rourke, said on Saturday that he would not allow \u201canyone in my cabinet to have a family member to work in a position like that.\u201d In the past, Mr. Biden has bristled at questions about whether his family had benefited financially from his political career. He did so again on Friday when he was asked whether his son\u2019s work in Ukraine represented a conflict of interest. Pointing a finger at the questioner he said: \u201cLet\u2019s focus on the problem. Focus on this man, what he\u2019s doing, that no president has ever done. No president!\u201d The Trump campaign was soon circulating a clip of the episode. For his allies, it is both poignant and painful that Mr. Biden\u2019s family is again at the heart of his public identity. He lost his first wife and daughter, and nearly lost his two sons, in a car accident in the weeks after he was elected to the Senate in 1972. His final years as vice president, as well as his hopes to run for president in 2016, were overwhelmed by his elder son Beau\u2019s death from brain cancer. Jim Mowrer, a former Democratic congressional candidate from Iowa who served with Beau Biden in the military, said he spoke to Hunter Biden early this year and got the impression he was trying to focus on personal matters rather than the campaign. Mr. Mowrer said he saw the elder Mr. Biden in Iowa last month and they discussed not Hunter but his other son, Beau. \u201cBeau\u2019s death is very, very fresh in his mind, and so now these attacks on Hunter are even more unsettling,\u201d Mr. Mowrer said. The politics of Ukraine and impeachment have been so costly for Mr. Biden, in part, because he is confronting so many other challenges in the Democratic race: a struggle to excite liberal primary voters, an ascendant rival in Ms. Warren and a decline in fund-raising that has forced him to spend even more time appealing to donors in cities hundreds of miles from the early primary states. Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign manager, Greg Schultz, acknowledged some of those problems in a briefing for Democratic donors at Morgan Stanley\u2019s New York office last month. Mr. Schultz assured the group that they had a path to the nomination that depended on winning South Carolina \u2014 the fourth primary state \u2014 and then scoring big victories in the Super Tuesday primaries in March. In South Carolina, where Mr. Biden\u2019s support appears strongest among the early-voting states, some of his supporters are discussing a trip to Iowa before Thanksgiving \u2014 to vouch for the former vice president, and to emphasize his ability to appeal to minority constituencies, like African-Americans. \u201cWe probably know Joe Biden a lot better than they do,\u201d said State Senator Dick Harpootlian of South Carolina, a Biden supporter. Mr. Schultz acknowledged at the briefing that Mr. Biden had been uneven at times during debates and on the stump. Still, he predicted Mr. Biden would maintain an advantage over Ms. Warren, saying she would struggle to overcome the persistent competition on the left from Mr. Sanders. But Ms. Warren has recently pulled well ahead of Mr. Sanders. Now, even Mr. Biden\u2019s own campaign aides privately acknowledge that South Carolina may not be much of a political firewall if Ms. Warren rolls through Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada. As he finds his way forward, Mr. Biden is relying on a circle of advisers, some formal and others less so, but there is no chief strategist. Mike Donilon, who wrote much of the Reno speech, may be the closest person to playing that role. Democrats who know Mr. Biden well say the campaign is mostly in his hands \u2014 and he makes the final calls. While Mr. Biden\u2019s team has done little polling in the race, he is expected to conduct a survey of Iowa Democrats next week on the Ukraine issue ahead of a new advertising push in the state. Mr. Biden has begun to escalate his attacks on the president, and his campaign began airing a commercial hitting back at the president for trying to \u201cpick his opponent and face only the candidates he thinks he can beat.\u201d Still, there is no final consensus, in Mr. Biden\u2019s camp, about how consistently he should confront Mr. Trump. \u201cHe\u2019s never gone negative,\u201d said William M. Daley, the former White House chief of staff, who worked on Mr. Biden\u2019s 1988 campaign. \u201cThat\u2019s not him, that\u2019s the charm of Joe.\u201d",

      "content": "  In public, for the last five days, Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his campaign have been on a ferocious offensive, ripping into President Trump for allegedly abusing his powers in asking Ukraine\u2019s leader to help hurt Mr. Biden politically, and castigating the news media for questioning his son Hunter Biden\u2019s financial dealings there. On Tuesday, Mr. Biden made his biggest move yet, saying Congress should start an impeachment inquiry against Mr. Trump if he does not cooperate with their investigations. In private, though, this has been an enraging and uncertain time for the Biden campaign, and for Mr. Biden himself, who associates say has been astounded both by Mr. Trump\u2019s contact with the Ukrainian government and his obvious enthusiasm for attacking Mr. Biden\u2019s family. He and his advisers have long feared that Hunter Biden would become a target for political opponents, according to people familiar with their thinking, and now the scrutiny of Mr. Biden\u2019s son is bound to intensify. And as Mr. Trump\u2019s onslaught has pushed the House of Representatives to start an impeachment inquiry, Mr. Biden now faces a crucial political test where his standing may hinge on how he handles a wildly unpredictable confrontation with Mr. Trump. Bryce Smith, the Democratic Party chairman in Dallas County, Iowa, said the moment showcased Mr. Biden as a candidate Mr. Trump is \u201cgenuinely worried about\u201d and offered a reminder of the lengths Mr. Trump may go to oppose any Democratic opponent. But it also exposed Mr. Biden to risks in the leadoff caucus state, he said. \u201cI could see people who are already on the fence about him, maybe because of his long career in politics, his age, his ability to win this, kind of going, \u2018Oh, great, we\u2019re already starting this and he hasn\u2019t even gotten the nomination,\u2019\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cAnd others going, \u2018He\u2019s obviously being thought of as a formidable opponent, if Trump is thinking about it like this.\u2019\u201d Mr. Biden and his campaign team have encouraged the latter interpretation, trying to project an image of strength in the primary and warning the press that the Biden campaign would deliver blunt criticism about coverage it sees as unfair. At a Philadelphia fund-raising event on Monday, Mr. Biden pledged, \u201cI\u2019m not going to take a punch and not punch back.\u201d Yet allies of Mr. Biden acknowledge privately that the campaign has been girding for months for criticism of Hunter Biden, who has charted a winding career as a bank executive, lobbyist and financier, often operating in parts of the private sector that overlapped with his father\u2019s footprint in government. They have declined to say whether they vetted Hunter Biden\u2019s business activities as part of preparing for the 2020 presidential campaign, arguing that the political world should be solely focused on Mr. Trump\u2019s conduct. There is no evidence that Mr. Biden, as vice president, intentionally tried to help his son in his dealings with Ukraine, but Hunter Biden\u2019s business career has sporadically drawn attention from political rivals and the media for more than a decade. Associates say Mr. Biden is infuriated by Mr. Trump\u2019s conduct and astonished by the president\u2019s willingness to dismiss some of the most basic ethical lines in American politics. In Wilmington, Del., Tuesday, Mr. Biden called the president\u2019s actions an \u201cabuse of power\u2019\u2019 that undermined national security, and said he would support impeachment if Mr. Trump did not provide information related to congressional investigations. In some respects, Mr. Trump\u2019s conduct has reinforced the central message of Mr. Biden\u2019s appeal to Democratic voters: that the country is threatened by an out-of-control presidency, and that ousting Mr. Trump is more important than any other policy goal Democrats might share. At fund-raisers and other events, Democrats who have spoken with Mr. Biden in recent days say he has largely appeared measured, greeting old friends in his typical effusive style and keeping the focus on his concerns with Mr. Trump\u2019s foreign policy, rather than dwelling on the challenges the moment raises for his family. Still unclear in this moment of crisis is what conclusions Democratic voters might make about Mr. Biden as an opponent for Mr. Trump, and how a drive for impeachment in Congress might shape the Democratic primary campaign. Former Gov. Tom Vilsack of Iowa, who saw Mr. Biden at a fund-raiser in Iowa on Saturday, said he believed that Mr. Trump\u2019s dangerous conduct was at the forefront of Mr. Biden\u2019s mind. \u201cI suspect he\u2019s just as focused and just as concerned about that as he is about an attack on a family member, as personal as that is,\u201d said Mr. Vilsack, who served as agriculture secretary in the Obama administration. A memo circulated to political surrogates from the Biden campaign on Tuesday urged supporters to note that \u201cthis isn\u2019t about Biden or his family. We all know who Trump is,\u201d and also suggested criticizing reporters for giving undeserved coverage to Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks on Mr. Biden and his son. \u201cTrump is successfully playing the same game he played in 2016 \u2014 and the press is falling for it again,\u201d the memo stated. This clash has come at a precarious moment for Mr. Biden\u2019s candidacy, as he seeks to recover momentum after a largely limp summer on the campaign trail. He has slipped in the polls over the last two months and faces an increasingly formidable challenge from Senator Elizabeth Warren: Two polls released in recent days showed her slightly overtaking him in Iowa and New Hampshire, the leadoff states in the Democratic nomination process. In the short term, at least, Mr. Trump may have effectively put Hunter Biden off limits for his father\u2019s Democratic rivals. It is unlikely that any other candidate in Mr. Biden\u2019s party would soon follow Mr. Trump in going after the former vice president\u2019s son on the subject of business ethics, while Mr. Trump may face an impeachment inquiry for allegedly pressuring a foreign government to do just that. Senator Bernie Sanders, for one, deflected a reporter\u2019s question on Tuesday about whether he thought the sudden focus on Hunter Biden\u2019s overseas work would weaken the Biden campaign. \u201cYou guys write very perceptive articles on these things, and I\u2019ll let you make that judgment,\u201d he replied. It is unclear, however, how well prepared Mr. Biden and his campaign may be to address questions about Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings beyond the specific case Mr. Trump has attempted to raise. Hunter Biden has operated for years in parts of the business world that intersected with his father\u2019s career in government, including working for MBNA, a Delaware-based bank, while his father was involved in rewriting the bankruptcy code as a senator, and leading an investment fund that did business in foreign countries while his father was vice president. Hunter Biden\u2019s work for MBNA briefly became an issue during his father\u2019s campaign for the vice presidency in 2008, and Obama-Biden campaign officials defended it as within the bounds of ethical propriety. TJ Ducklo, a spokesman for Mr. Biden, said the former vice president was indeed angry that Mr. Trump was \u201clying about his family, and now appears to be blackmailing a foreign government into helping legitimize those lies.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s fighting back, which is what Democrats want to see in their nominee and why he will beat Donald Trump next fall,\u201d Mr. Ducklo said, adding, \u201cThe V.P. and his family know Donald Trump plays dirty, and they can take it.\u201d Mr. Ducklo declined to say whether the campaign had vetted Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings and said the media should not be asking questions like that. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to indulge Trump\u2019s conspiracy theories, and we\u2019re not going to dignify his attacks with a response,\u201d he said. Mr. Biden is said to have limited patience for discussing Hunter Biden\u2019s apparent political vulnerabilities, even in private. Some of Mr. Biden\u2019s close advisers have argued in private settings that going after any member of Mr. Biden\u2019s family \u2014 including Hunter Biden \u2014 would ultimately backfire on an opponent, because of Mr. Biden\u2019s stature and the sympathetic feelings much of the public has for him and his family. For Mr. Biden, the matter of his son is deeply sensitive for reasons that have nothing to do with politics: While the whole Biden family endorsed his choice to enter the 2020 race, friends of Mr. Biden said consistently throughout his deliberations that his deepest anxiety was the impact of a campaign on a family still grappling with profound loss after the death of Mr. Biden\u2019s elder son, Beau Biden, in 2015, from brain cancer. \u201cI know that he worked through that, he did a lot of contemplation about how it would affect the family,\u201d said the Rev. Joseph Darby, an influential South Carolina-based pastor who has known Mr. Biden for years. Earlier this year, Hunter Biden spoke in detail to The New Yorker magazine about the crippling grief he experienced after his brother\u2019s death, and his long-running struggles with drug addiction. The magazine story also detailed a number of potential ethical conflicts in Hunter Biden\u2019s business activities and described the vice president as having dealt \u201cwith Hunter\u2019s activities by largely ignoring them.\u201d",

Biden Jr. is increasingly dependent on his top donors, many of whom met in Philadelphia.By Shane GoldmacherPRINT EDITIONWith Biden Under Attack, Big-Money Donors Gather to Plot Fortifications|October 7, 2019, Page A20",
      "author": "Shane Goldmacher",
      "content": " PHILADELPHIA \u2014 Leading donors for Joseph R. Biden Jr. convened this weekend for their first donor retreat since he announced his candidacy and struck a determined posture as Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign found itself under assault from President Trump, losing its clear front-runner status and lapped in the money chase by multiple Democratic rivals, most notably Senator Elizabeth Warren. Over cocktails on Friday evening and a Saturday spent in a drab hotel conference room, Mr. Biden\u2019s top financiers and fund-raisers received strategy briefings and PowerPoint presentations, and plotted the path forward for the former vice president, who suddenly found himself in fourth place in the money chase. Only hours before the gathering began, the news broke that Ms. Warren, now seen as Mr. Biden\u2019s chief rival, had out-raised him in the last three months by nearly $10 million \u2014 $24.6 million to $15.2 million. He lagged behind Senator Bernie Sanders ($25.3 million) and Mayor Pete Buttigieg ($19.1 million), too. While some were downbeat about the financial figures, Mr. Biden\u2019s slip in the polls and the onslaught from Mr. Trump, the Biden loyalists described a sense of almost burden and responsibility. If Mr. Biden is to compete financially with the online windfalls of Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren, several donors said, they believe it would be on the shoulders of the bundlers assembled here. \u201cAll of us realize that Joe Biden does not have the online fund-raising capability of a Warren. Warren has been doing it longer than him. Sanders has been doing it longer than him,\u201d said Dick Harpootlian, a prominent South Carolina supporter who hosted a fund-raiser for Mr. Biden in May. [Which Democrats are leading the 2020 presidential race this week?] Denise Bauer, a former ambassador to Belgium, said there was an urgency in the air. \u201cWe need him to get the nomination because he\u2019s the one who can win,\u201d she said, adding \u201cWe are all going to try to raise every single dollar we can.\u201d Some donors played down the importance of the very currency that had brought them to Philadelphia in the first place for what the campaign called a \u201cfinance committee forum,\u201d questioning, for instance, whether Mr. Buttigieg and Mr. Sanders had the other political assets needed to seriously challenge Mr. Biden. In a sign of the attendees\u2019 significant financial firepower, Mr. Biden himself addressed the several dozen donors who came to the retreat on Saturday, rallying them for 45 minutes about the months ahead, people there said. The campaign kept the session with Mr. Biden behind closed doors, despite pledging to open his fund-raising events to reporters. The campaign said this event with Mr. Biden\u2019s biggest bundlers was different because no money was actually raised. On Friday afternoon, the donors received a tour of Mr. Biden\u2019s downtown Philadelphia office before decamping to the second floor of The Continental Mid-town, a retro-style bar a few blocks away where they sported shiny \u201cJoe 2020\u201d pins and sipped from an open bar. On Saturday, there were a series of closed-door briefings, with updates from most of Mr. Biden\u2019s top brass, including his campaign manager, Greg Schultz, and former chief of staff as vice president, Steve Ricchetti, about the run-up to the Iowa caucuses through Super Tuesday, including delegate math and digital tactics, according to attendees, who were asked to keep the proceedings private. Multiple attendees said Ms. Warren was, by far, Mr. Biden\u2019s most discussed opponent, with his strategists telling donors they expected her to come under new press scrutiny now that she has risen in the polls. Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren, who refuse to hold traditional fund-raisers or coddle members of the contributor class like those gathered in Philadelphia, have raced ahead of Mr. Biden in fund-raising by attracting hundreds of thousands of small donors online. Ms. Warren had 940,000 donations in the last three months; Mr. Sanders had 1.4 million; Mr. Biden, who sharply cut back digital spending in August, has not disclosed his total number of donations. Some contributors played down the significance of money in a race flooded by free news media attention, and for a candidate like Mr. Biden whose reputation has been established after more than a decade in the national spotlight. [Keep up with the 2020 field with our candidate tracker.] \u201cHow is money working out for Sanders and Mayor Pete?\u201d asked John Morgan, a lawyer and top Biden fund-raiser in Florida who has hosted the former vice president at his home but who did not attend the summit. \u201cJoe has more than plenty.\u201d Donors were also shown Mr. Biden\u2019s latest ads; the campaign had announced a $6 million television and digital ad purchase on Thursday in the four early voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. The summit comes less than four months before the opening Iowa caucuses. And it comes as Mr. Trump has relentlessly attacked Mr. Biden, soliciting the assistance of foreign nations to investigate him, his son Hunter and his business deals, sparking an impeachment inquiry in the House of Representatives. Donors, many of whom spoke on condition of anonymity, were on edge about how the impeachment proceedings would play out. Would Mr. Trump\u2019s focus on Mr. Biden end up helping him by making it appear that Mr. Trump fears him? Or would Mr. Trump\u2019s barrage \u2014 including on the airwaves in early states \u2014 and the president\u2019s singular ability to command attention irreparably wound Mr. Biden in the mind of primary voters? \u201cHe\u2019s running a primary campaign and a general at the same time and I think he\u2019s doing a great job,\u201d said Sheila Nix, a former chief of staff to Dr. Jill Biden, who attended the forum. \u201cIt\u2019s a little unprecedented having to do both at the same time.\u201d Biden campaign officials  said that they had always expected the primary race to tighten, it was just a matter of who would emerge as their strongest opponent. Still, the reality began to sink in for the assembled donors: Mr. Biden is likely to be outspent in the coming months. Unlike his two leading rivals, Mr. Biden did not disclose a cash-on-hand total. Mr. Sanders had $33.7 million in the bank. Ms. Warren has $25.7 million. Mr. Biden is expected to report only a fraction of that. Even if he had spent zero dollars since July 1 \u2014 and he has spent millions \u2014 his cash on hand would be less than Mr. Sanders\u2019s or Ms. Warren\u2019s. Mr. Biden spent $5 million in both May and June, the most recent months that federal records are available. His staff and campaign costs have only ballooned since then, suggesting he likely spent nearly all, if not more than, the $15.2 million he raised in the last three months. As the race has narrowed to only three candidates polling consistently above single digits \u2014 Mr. Biden, Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders \u2014 some see an opportunity for Mr. Biden to consolidate a donor class that is typically more moderate than the grass-roots donors powering the Warren and Sanders campaigns. Mr. Buttigieg and Senators Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey have been the chief competitors for bundler loyalty. But Mr. Biden\u2019s uneven performances on the stump and the debates have slowed such movement. During the last debate, a group of Democratic donors gathered for a private event in Manhattan with the strategists James Carville and Paul Begala providing color commentary. When Mr. Biden went on his discursive and meandering answer that invoked a record-player, there were audible groans, and some people threw their arms in the air in frustration, according to an attendee. In an interview, Mr. Carville said Mr. Trump\u2019s recent \u201cobsession\u201d with Mr. Biden made the former vice president\u2019s electability case better than anyone else could. \u201cI think Biden has been given a lifeline here,\u201d Mr. Carville said. \u201cI hope he takes it.\u201d Among the ads attendees were shown was a new one from Friday in which Mr. Biden accused Mr. Trump of trying to \u201cchoose the Democratic candidate.\u201d For all the incoming Mr. Biden has taken \u2014 from his rivals, from the White House and from, as his campaign likes to point out, the news media \u2014 his advisers believe his continued perch atop many polls proves his resilience, no matter his shrinking lead. \u201cI always come away from things with him thinking I\u2019ve got to work harder. I need to do more,\u201d Ms. Bauer said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t ask for that. He inspires that.\u201d",

      "author": "Nicholas Fandos",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 House Democrats prepared on Wednesday to force the Trump administration anew to answer questions in their impeachment investigation, one day after President Trump and the White House declared that they would defy Congress in one of the most extraordinary assertions of executive authority in modern times. House chairmen leading the impeachment inquiry planned to issue additional subpoenas for witness testimony and records related to Mr. Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine as soon as Thursday, lawmakers and aides said, after a pause for the Jewish High Holy Days. They want to force executive branch officials to answer to their demands, generating a detailed record of refusals that could shape an impeachment article charging Mr. Trump with obstructing Congress. Democrats also still see other meaningful avenues for gathering evidence that go around the Trump administration\u2019s defiance, including questioning private citizens, former officials, career diplomats near retirement and the whistle-blowers whose revelations fueled the inquiry. \u201cThere is more we want to do,\u201d said Representative Jim Himes of Connecticut, the second-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. He called the White House\u2019s stonewalling \u201ca brazen political move to try to align what has been a fragmented and uncertain strategy to defend the president.\u201d The Democrats\u2019 investigation earned a prominent endorsement as former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., a leading presidential candidate, said in a speech on Wednesday in New Hampshire that Mr. Trump should be impeached for \u201cshooting holes in the Constitution.\u201d Mr. Biden set aside months of restraint complicated by the president\u2019s unsubstantiated allegations about Mr. Biden\u2019s own dealings with Ukraine. But the White House\u2019s promise to put a \u201cfull halt\u201d on cooperating with the impeachment inquiry was likely to force Democrats to more quickly confront questions about how long and how extensively to investigate Mr. Trump when ample evidence of his actions is already in the open. So far, the Democrats have secured public support for their inquiry. Polls show that a majority of the public backs it, but if the White House successfully stanches the flow of evidence and lawmakers extend their investigation without delivering significant new findings, that support could erode. \u201cEvery new piece of information has corroborated the basic facts, which are devastating for the president,\u201d said Representative Sean Patrick Maloney, Democrat of New York and a member of the Intelligence Committee. \u201cHow many smoking guns are we going to get? The president\u2019s own words incriminate him. Every supporting document we have seen further supports the devastating facts we are learning more about every day.\u201d But moving too quickly toward drafting articles of impeachment could expose Democrats to charges that their inquiry was a rush to tarnish the Trump presidency rather than a pursuit of the truth. Mr. Trump and other top administration officials, as well as his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani, embarked in recent months on a campaign to pressure President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to open investigations that could benefit Mr. Trump politically. A whistle-blower complaint helped bring the scandal more fully into public view and prompted the impeachment inquiry, and Democrats say they want to ensure that they are fully scrutinizing the facts before they move forward. \u201cThere is another risk, which is you don\u2019t get to the bottom of the story,\u201d Mr. Himes said. \u201cWas Rudy Giuliani running his own State Department? What other people were pressured to go along with this?\u201d The White House\u2019s charged assertion late Tuesday that it would try to stymie the inquiry came in a letter from Pat A. Cipollone, the White House counsel, but the document read more like a political argument than a legal one. \u201cPut simply, you seek to overturn the results of the 2016 election and deprive the American people of the president they have freely chosen,\u201d Mr. Cipollone wrote. \u201cMany Democrats now apparently view impeachment not only as a means to undo the democratic results of the last election, but as a strategy to influence the next election, which is barely more than a year away.\u201d [As the White House counsel, Mr. Cipollone is building a case for defiance on impeachment.] Mr. Trump said on Wednesday that he was ready for a long fight with the Democrats but implied that he might reconsider if the House were to hold a vote authorizing the inquiry and granting Republicans and the White House new powers to call and cross-examine witnesses in the inquiry. \u201cWe would if they give us our rights,\u201d he said of Democrats. And Mr. Trump\u2019s congressional allies continued to try to undercut the impeachment case. Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he would invite Kurt D. Volker, the former United States special envoy to Ukraine, to testify in public if the House did not release of a transcript of its private interview with him. Mr. Volker helped try to secure commitments from Mr. Zelensky\u2019s government to investigate corruption, serving as an intermediary between the Ukrainians, Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani. House Democrats released damaging text messages that Mr. Volker shared showing his conversations with other American diplomats and a top Ukrainian aide. But Republicans argued that Democrats were trying to cover up the fact that he told investigators behind closed doors that he saw nothing untoward between the Trump administration and the Ukrainian government. Democratic leaders have made clear that they view Mr. Cipollone\u2019s letter as an invalid legal document and warned Mr. Trump and other potential witnesses that ignoring subpoenas would carry consequences. Speaker Nancy Pelosi retorted to Mr. Trump late Tuesday that he was not \u201cabove the law\u201d and hinted that any efforts to undercut Congress\u2019s investigation would only fuel her impeachment case. \u201cThe White House should be warned that continued efforts to hide the truth of the president\u2019s abuse of power from the American people will be regarded as further evidence of obstruction,\u201d she said. Other Democrats more explicitly pointed to one of the three articles of impeachment the House Judiciary Committee approved in 1974 charging Richard M. Nixon with failing to provide information to House inquirers. House leaders have signaled that they are highly unlikely to take any of the Ukraine-related disputes over information into court, as they did when the White House blocked earlier requests from congressional Democrats seeking to conduct oversight. Though the House continues to litigate those earlier cases in the courts, new lawsuits would take far longer to resolve than the amount of time that Democrats believe they have to decide on impeachment. Though they did not issue their request publicly, Democrats moved on Wednesday to line up at least one additional witness deposition, with a former White House foreign policy adviser, and requested she produce documents related to their inquiry. Fiona Hill, who until this summer served as senior director for Europe at the National Security Council, was expected to appear Monday for a deposition, two officials involved in the inquiry said. Ms. Hill turned over her responsibilities shortly before Mr. Trump\u2019s July phone call with Mr. Zelensky. Axios first reported the request. Two key State Department figures will also face choices in the coming days about whether to step down and testify to Congress or remain in the administration and keep quiet, according to current and former diplomats. William B. Taylor Jr., America\u2019s top diplomat in Ukraine, has already retired twice from the State Department and was called back into service most recently to go to Kiev. He has already threatened to quit once in protest over Mr. Trump\u2019s Ukraine policy, according to the text messages that Mr. Volker shared with congressional investigators. Marie L. Yovanovitch, who was forced out by the Trump administration as ambassador to Ukraine, is teaching at Georgetown University and nearing the end of her foreign service career. If she wants to tell her story to Congress, she will have no choice but to quit, the current and former officials said. But even if they do resign, both Mr. Taylor and Ms. Yovanovitch could face hurdles to testifying in the impeachment inquiry. Mr. Trump could seek to tie up both officials\u2019 eyewitness accounts in court by threatening legal action. Congressional investigators also believe they can glean important information from private citizens whom the White House cannot claim executive privilege over and would also have a more difficult time evading subpoenas. Most prominent among them is Mr. Giuliani, who appears to have orchestrated the monthslong effort to secure Ukrainian government support for investigations into Mr. Biden and his son and another unfounded theory about Ukrainian meddling in the 2016 election. Investigators have subpoenaed Mr. Giuliani for a vast set of records, to be delivered early next week. The House is prepared to issue subpoenas to two associates of Mr. Giuliani, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who helped him try to stir up investigations in Ukraine, if they do not show up for scheduled depositions this week. The men worked to gather information in Kiev about the Bidens and matters related to the 2016 election. Mr. Parnas also helped connect Mr. Giuliani and Ukrainian prosecutors. And then there are the whistle-blowers whose accounts have provided a road map to investigators. Lawmakers are finalizing arrangements to talk to the first whistle-blower, who may be able to provide additional information or investigative leads. The whistle-blower\u2019s lawyers have confirmed that they are also representing a second official who had more direct knowledge of the effort to pressure Ukraine. Lawmakers are also likely to want to speak to that official.",

New details emerged about some of them on Thursday after the indictment of two associates of Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president\u2019s private lawyer. Arrested as they sought to leave the country with one-way tickets, Mr. Giuliani\u2019s associates, Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman, have both been called to testify in the House impeachment inquiry. Mr. Parnas was born in Ukraine, and Mr. Fruman in Belarus. Both are now American citizens, based in southern Florida. Thursday\u2019s indictment charges them with camouflaging political donations in order to advance the political interests of Ukrainian government officials as well as their own business interests. Over the past two years, they appear to have been pursuing two distinct goals. One was to help Mr. Giuliani oust the American ambassador to Ukraine and gather negative information about the business dealings of Hunter Biden, the younger son of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., in that country. Allegations that Mr. Trump pressured Volodymyr Zelensky, the newly elected president of Ukraine, to investigate the Bidens in exchange for a White House meeting or military aid \u2014 or both \u2014 are at the center of the impeachment inquiry. The pair\u2019s other goal was to use political contributions in order to change state and federal policies to further their recreational marijuana business venture. An unnamed foreigner with \u201cRussian roots\u201d gave them $1 million for that purpose, according to the indictment. It is illegal for foreigners to donate to American political campaigns. Both men appear to have met Mr. Trump. Mr. Parnas posted a photograph of himself with the president on Twitter in June, saying he was honored to call Mr. Trump his friend. Mr. Fruman told one news outlet that Mr. Trump invited him to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Fla., in March 2018 for one of the president\u2019s first fund-raising events for the 2020 election. Last year, Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman donated $325,000 to a pro-Trump super PAC, America First Action. They claimed the funds came from an energy company they had recently created. In fact, the firm had no income and no assets, according to the indictment. Prosecutors stated the funds came from a transaction between Mr. Fruman and third parties whom they did not name. In an intriguing development, Thursday\u2019s indictment cites Mr. Parnas\u2019s efforts to help Mr. Giuliani and others oust Ms. Yovanovitch as the American ambassador in Ukraine. The State Department recalled her to the United States in May, months before the scheduled end of her tenure. How she lost her post is a key part of the impeachment inquiry. Ms. Yovanovitch\u2019s critics alleged that she was disloyal to Mr. Trump. One informal adviser to the president made an unsubstantiated claim that she had told Ukrainian officials to ignore Mr. Trump\u2019s policies because he would be impeached. In his July call with Mr. Zelensky, Mr. Trump described the ambassador as \u201cbad news,\u201d warning, \u201cShe\u2019s going to go through some things.\u201d Allies of Ms. Yovanovitch say they fear she was removed because she was an obstacle to Mr. Trump\u2019s hopes that Ukraine would investigate the Bidens. Numerous foreign policy experts describe the three-time ambassador as highly competent and nonpartisan. She is scheduled to testify Friday in the House impeachment inquiry, but it is unclear whether the administration, which claims the inquiry is not legitimate, will allow her to appear. So far, neither she nor her lawyers have commented publicly. Mr. Sessions, a former Republican congressman from Texas, is referred to in the indictment, but not by name. Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman contributed to his 2018 re-election campaign, disguising one contribution to avoid campaign finance limits. The indictment alleges that Mr. Parnas recruited Mr. Sessions, then the chairman of the powerful House Rules Committee, to help try to oust Ms. Yovanovitch. At the same time, he and Mr. Fruman promised to help Mr. Sessions raise more than $20,000 for re-election. In a letter last year to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Mr. Sessions accused Ms. Yovanovitch of disloyalty to the president. Mr. Sessions lost his re-election bid, but announced this month that he was running for a different Texas congressional seat in 2020. He said Thursday that he knew nothing about the campaign finance scheme, and that he criticized the ambassador for one reason only: \u201cI believe that political appointees should not be disparaging the president, especially while serving overseas.\u201d Both men were charged in the indictment, but not in connection with Ukraine. Rather, they were involved in the scheme with Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman to influence state and federal politicians to help get licenses for a recreational marijuana business. The business venture ultimately failed. Born in Ukraine, Mr. Kukushkin, 46, is an American citizen living in the San Francisco area. Mr. Correia, 44, an American businessman, has described himself as an entrepreneur who works for a company that says it helps investors reduce the risk of fraud. The influence-peddling scheme involved an unnamed foreigner with \u201cRussian roots\u201d who transferred $1 million \u201cto cover all the donations\u201d to federal candidates, as well as state candidates and politicians in Nevada, New York and elsewhere. In Nevada, the men missed the application deadline but hoped officials would grant them a license anyway. They donated $10,000 to Wesley Karl Duncan, a Republican candidate running for attorney general in Nevada, who lost. Mr. Fruman also donated $10,000 to Adam Laxalt, then the state\u2019s attorney general who was running for governor. He also lost, but remains an influential politician in Nevada, a critical state in the presidential race. In October 2018, Mr. Laxalt spoke at a Trump rally in Elko, Nev. Last month, the acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, traveled to a Nevada event hosted by Mr. Laxalt, according to news reports. The indictment states that Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman both worked for at least one Ukrainian government official who tried to remove the American ambassador. It was not immediately clear who that was, or whether the individual was still in the government. Ukraine\u2019s government turned over this May after Mr. Zelensky\u2019s election. Yuriy Lutsenko, a fierce opponent of Ms. Yovanovitch, was fired. Mr. Trump appeared to praise Mr. Lutsenko in his July phone call with the Ukrainian president. But Mr. Lutsenko was by no means the only Ukrainian official critical of Ms. Yovanovitch, who vigorously complained about corruption in the Ukrainian government, including in the prosecutor general\u2019s office. Another official, still in the government, is Kostiantyn Kulyk, a deputy prosecutor. Allegations of corruption made him toxic in the eyes of some American officials.",

Yovanovitch was recalled from Ukraine after a long campaign against her by Rudolph Giuliani and his allies. Her boss told her she had \u201cdone nothing wrong.\u201dBy Sharon LaFraniere, Nicholas Fandos and Andrew E. KramerPRINT EDITIONEx-Envoy to Ukraine Testifies \u2018False Claims\u2019 Propelled Ouster|October 12, 2019, Page A1",

      "content": "   WASHINGTON \u2014 The State Department\u2019s request went in early March to Marie L. Yovanovitch, a longtime diplomat who had served six presidents: Would she extend her term as ambassador to Ukraine, scheduled to end in August, into 2020? Less than two months later came another departmental communiqu\u00e9: Get \u201con the next plane\u201d to Washington. Her ambassadorship was over. How and why Ms. Yovanovitch was removed from her job has emerged as a major focus of the impeachment inquiry being conducted by House Democrats. And in nearly nine hours of testimony behind closed doors on Capitol Hill on Friday, Ms. Yovanovitch said she was told after her recall that President Trump had lost trust in her and had been seeking her ouster since summer 2018 \u2014 even though, one of her bosses told her, she had \u201cdone nothing wrong.\u201d Her version of events added a new dimension to the tale of the campaign against her. It apparently began with a business proposition being pursued in Ukraine by two Americans who, according to an indictment against them unsealed on Thursday, wanted her gone, and who would later become partners with the president\u2019s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani in digging up political dirt in Ukraine for Mr. Trump. From there it became part of the effort by Mr. Giuliani to undercut the special counsel\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and push for damaging information about former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., a possible Democratic challenger to Mr. Trump in 2020. In her prepared testimony to House investigators, Ms. Yovanovitch, 60, offered no new details about how Mr. Giuliani\u2019s campaign against her was communicated to the president or how Mr. Trump communicated his demand that she be ordered home. But her opening remarks, provided to The New York Times, amounted to a scathing indictment to Congress of how the Trump administration\u2019s foreign policy intersected with business and political considerations. Americans abroad in search of personal gain or private influence \u2014 especially in a country like Ukraine with a long history of corruption and people eager to exploit them \u2014 threatened to undermine the work of loyal diplomats and the foreign policy goals of the United States, she said. Her removal, she said, was a case in point. \u201cAlthough I understand that I served at the pleasure of the president, I was nevertheless incredulous that the U.S. government chose to remove an ambassador based, as best as I can tell, on unfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives,\u201d she said. Ms. Yovanovitch\u2019s testimony, which could help build momentum for the impeachment inquiry, captured the arc of her troubled tenure in Ukraine: how Mr. Giuliani and his allies mounted a campaign against her based on what she described as scurrilous lies, how the State Department capitulated to the president\u2019s demands to recall her, and the upshot \u2014 losing an experienced ambassador in a pivotal country that is under threat from Russia and in the middle of a change in government. More broadly, she portrayed the State Department as a whole as \u201cattacked and hollowed out from within.\u201d Unless it backs up its diplomats, especially in the face of false attacks by foreign interests, she said, more of them will leave and the wrong message will be transmitted around the world. \u201cBad actors\u201d in Ukraine and elsewhere will \u201csee how easy it is to use fiction and innuendo to manipulate our system,\u201d she warned. \u201cThe only interests that will be served are those of our strategic adversaries, like Russia.\u201d She had been removed from her post in Ukraine before the events most at the heart of the impeachment inquiry: whether Mr. Trump withheld White House meetings or military aid to Ukraine this summer to pressure its new president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to investigate Mr. Biden and his younger son, Hunter Biden. That Ms. Yovanovitch, who remains a State Department employee, showed up at all to testify was remarkable. In a letter this week, the White House counsel, Pat A. Cipollone, lashed out at the impeachment inquiry, saying government officials would not testify and that no documents would be provided. The White House did not respond to requests for comment on Friday. Ms. Yovanovitch\u2019s defiance of the administration\u2019s directive against appearing before the impeachment proceeding raises the possibility that other government officials will follow suit. She called upon the State Department leaders and Congress to defend the institution, saying \u201cI fear that not doing so will harm our nation\u2019s interest, perhaps irreparably.\u201d The turnabout appeared to validate the tactics adopted by Democrats, who have issued rapid-fire subpoenas since they opened the inquiry two weeks ago and warned that any attempts by the administration to block their fact-finding will promptly become fodder for an article of impeachment charging Mr. Trump with obstructing Congress. When the State Department tried late Thursday to direct Ms. Yovanovitch not to appear, the Democrats promptly issued a subpoena and told her she had no choice but to appear. At least one other State Department official is also expected to testify, despite the White House policy. Gordon D. Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union who was initially expected to testify this week but failed to show up, has now been rescheduled for next week. Mr. Sondland is close to Mr. Trump and could support the White House\u2019s narrative that the administration\u2019s policy in Ukraine has been driven by a focus on rooting out corruption. Ms. Yovanovitch, a 33-year veteran of the foreign service, had held two previous ambassadorships when President Barack Obama appointed her as envoy to Ukraine in mid-2016. She was deeply steeped in the region and American policy. But in 2018, she found herself targeted by two American businessmen, Lev Parnas, who was born in Ukraine and Igor Fruman, who was born in Belarus. Both came to play central roles in Mr. Giuliani\u2019s efforts on behalf of Mr. Trump in Ukraine. But at first, the two men were focused on their own business dealings. One possible reason for their opposition to Ms. Yovanovitch was that they perceived her to be standing in the way of a business plan they were promoting. Ms. Yovanovitch was a supporter of a reform-minded chief executive of Naftogaz, Ukraine\u2019s state energy company. The two men were hoping to sell American liquefied natural gas to Naftogaz, but the chief executive, Andriy Kobolyev, had rejected their proposal. American diplomats traditionally pay close attention to the energy industry in Ukraine, long a font of corruption and an avenue for Russia to influence Ukrainian politics. In that same vein, Ms. Yovanovitch had supported Mr. Kobolyev to curb back room deals. Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman had a plan to replace Mr. Kobolyev: they suggested to another Naftogaz executive that using their political ties in the United States, they could install him in Mr. Kobolyev\u2019s place if he accepted their business deal. Those negotiations were described by Dale Perry, an American energy executive and former business partner of a Naftogaz executive, who is familiar with the conversations. The pair also had a plan to replace the ambassador. They tried to undermine her with the Ukrainian government and news media by spreading stories that she was an Obama holdover who disdained Mr. Trump, interviews show. \u201cI found it very troubling and disturbing that a couple of business people, and whoever they were working with, could claim to remove a U.S. ambassador,\u201d Mr. Perry said. Promising to help him raise $20,000 toward his re-election, they enlisted the help of Pete Sessions, who was then a Republican congressman from Texas then serving as the powerful head of the House Rules Committee, according to an indictment unsealed on Thursday charging Mr. Parnas, Mr. Fruman and two other men with violating campaign finance laws. Mr. Sessions sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo claiming without evidence that the ambassador was disloyal to the president. Ms. Yovanovitch also had repeated run-ins with Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general, Yuriy Lutsenko, over allegations of corruption with the prosecutor\u2019s office. Mr. Lutsenko would also come to work closely with Mr. Giuliani on the effort to help Mr. Trump. As they pursued their own agenda in Ukraine in 2018, Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman were also working more closely to dig up political dirt with Mr. Giuliani, with whom Mr. Parnas also had a separate business relationship. As part of that effort, Mr. Giuliani seized on criticism of Ms. Yovanovitch as another way to suggest that she was disloyal to Mr. Trump and could have been part of an effort to undercut him from Ukraine during the 2016 campaign. Mr. Giuliani helped encourage further stories in conservative news outlets critical of her early in 2019, even as the State Department was asking her to remain in Ukraine until next year. Some State Department officials were distressed by the critical news reports. Philip Reeker, an acting assistant secretary of state, told an adviser to Mr. Pompeo in an email that in casting her as a \u201cliberal outpost,\u201d critics were pushing a \u201cfake narrative\u201d that \u201creally is without merit or validation.\u201d By this March, the attacks against Ms. Yovanovitch were reverberating in the president\u2019s own circle. Donald Trump Jr., the president\u2019s oldest son, posted a link on social media to an item that described the ambassador as \u201can anti-Trump, Obama flunkey.\u201d In his tweet, Mr. Trump called for fewer of \u201cthese jokers as ambassadors. \u201c Four days later, Mr. Giuliani hand-delivered to Mr. Pompeo a packet of news articles and material critical of Ms. Yovanovitch. It included notes on an interview with a former prosecutor general of Ukraine, who had met with Mr. Giuliani. The former prosecutor claimed that Ms. Yovanovitch had blocked him from getting a visa to the United States and \u201cis close to Mr. Biden.\u201d In late April, Ms. Yovanovitch received the message summoning her back to Washington to be told of her removal. Mr. Fruman and Mr. Parnas were arrested Wednesday night at Dulles International Airport, on their way out of the country and charged with campaign finance violations, related in part to their dealings with Mr. Sessions. Prosecutors said they were working with at least one unnamed Ukrainian official who wanted to oust Ms. Yovanovitch. Ms. Yovanovitch told House investigators that while she did not know Mr. Giuliani\u2019s motives for attacking her, his associates \u201cmay well have believed that their personal financial ambitions were stymied by our anti-corruption policy in Ukraine.\u201d Her sudden removal left American diplomats in Kiev seething. They told reporters privately that Ms. Yovanovitch had been treated shabbily and that Mr. Giuliani\u2019s freelancing diplomacy was undercutting their efforts to work with the new Ukrainian president\u2019s administration. She recounted her conversation about her ouster with John Sullivan, the deputy secretary of state, at some length. While Ms. Yovanovitch was testifying, Mr. Trump nominated Mr. Sullivan to be the next ambassador to Russia. The timing appeared to be coincidental. In a meeting in Washington, she said Mr. Sullivan told her \u201cthat this was not like other situations where he had recalled ambassadors for cause.\u201d He added \u201cthat there had been a concerted campaign against me and that the department had been under pressure from the president to remove me since the summer of 2018.\u201d She expressed dismay and disappointment about her experience, and predicted serious consequences if the State Department failed to defend itself as an institution. \u201cThe harm will come not just through the inevitable and continuing resignation and loss of many of this nation\u2019s most loyal and talented public servants,\u201d she said. \u201cIt also will come when those diplomats who soldier on and do their best to represent our nation face partners abroad who question whether the ambassador truly speaks for the president and can be counted upon as a reliable partner. The harm will come when private interests circumvent professional diplomats for their own gain, not the public good.\u201d",

      "content": " IOWA CITY \u2014 Oliver Hanlon was beaming ear-to-ear as he stood next to Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts on a riverside stage at the University of Iowa. \u201cI met the president,\u201d he shouted, bounding down the steps two at a time. His mother gently corrected him: \u201cNot yet,\u201d she said, while the Warren photo line snaked on behind her. Oliver couldn\u2019t be faulted for his civics proficiency; he\u2019s 7 years old. The 2020 Democratic presidential campaign stops are crawling with children, some of whom spend most of the stump speeches crawling away from their parents. While all of the candidates seek to portray a family-friendly image, it takes work to bring a youngster to a campaign event: They often start late and run well into the evening, with a policy discussion not exactly accessible on the elementary-school level; bigger rallies often take place outdoors, regardless of weather. Kissing babies and tousling children\u2019s hair has long been a staple of retail campaigning, but in 2020 it is about more than a photo op, even the cutest of photo ops. In a historically crowded field, in an era of uncertain polling, these campaign stops are something of a past-their-bedtimes straw poll, revealing which candidates young parents deem viable or famous enough to risk a tantrum or a sleep-deprived meltdown over the next morning. For now, the leaders appear to be Ms. Warren and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who have both taken steps to cater to the children and parents who come see them. It\u2019s one more subtle measure of their stature in a race that is steadily narrowing from the largest primary field in history to just a handful of viable contenders. Ms. Warren and Mr. Biden, whose staffs both go to great lengths to present their events as family friendly, are currently atop the Democratic polls, which might explain the pep talk parents often give their children before meeting the two candidates: You are talking to the next president. Ms. Warren lets families with children cut to the front of her selfie line, a strong incentive given that supporters often wait hours for a 20-second interaction and photograph. Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign stops over the summer and fall have often come with free ice cream \u2014 and if frozen dairy products are not available, he\u2019s been known to hand out cash with instructions for children to tell their parents to stop for a treat on the way home. During a Labor Day swing through Iowa, Mr. Biden worked a chocolate-and-vanilla swirl machine at one union picnic and handed out ice cream sandwiches at another. Last month in Iowa City, Clara Engler, 5, spent hours before an evening Warren rally at the University of Iowa practicing the \u201cpinkie promise\u201d that has become a staple for young girls at Ms. Warren\u2019s events. With her mother, Brooke Engler, an Iowa City cosmetologist, Clara worked on locking fingers briefly and looking up, so she could hear Ms. Warren tell her that running for president is \u201cwhat girls do.\u201d When the moment came, about a half-hour after Clara\u2019s bedtime, Ms. Warren got down on one knee, looked her in the eye and made the promise. Clara jumped up with glee. Her mother beamed. \u201cShe\u2019d seen it before on TV,\u201d Ms. Engler said. \u201cIt\u2019s nice that I can have my child sit back and watch politics without worrying about what will be said.\u201d The others in the 19-candidate Democratic field aren\u2019t overtly inhospitable to children, but former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas peppers his stump speech with profanity and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont isn\u2019t a fuzzy figure while delivering his policy-heavy stemwinders. In early September he scolded a crying baby to \u201ckeep it down\u201d during a campaign stop in New Hampshire. Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., whose most fervent supporters tend to be young enough not to have children of their own, often attracts older kids \u2014 particularly L.G.B.T. teens inspired by the first openly gay major candidate for president. \u201cWhen you know that there\u2019s something historic about your campaign, you feel a level of responsibility that goes with that,\u201d Mr. Buttigieg said aboard his Iowa campaign bus last month. \u201cIt certainly adds a level of motivation when people come up to you, sometimes with tears in their eyes, just letting you know what the fact of your campaign means to them.\u201d Even in Iowa, where rare is the weekend without a presidential hopeful stumping nearby, it takes a serious commitment and coordination to attend a campaign event with young children. \u201cIf she starts crying we\u2019ll run out quickly,\u201d Elizabeth Batey, a lawyer from Waverly, Iowa, said of her 2-year-old daughter, Hattie, while waiting for Mr. Buttigieg last month in a stuffy storefront in Iowa Falls. Ms. Batey, whose 4-month-old son, George, was asleep in his car seat, made it through Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s event without having to flee. Afterward, she waited on the sidewalk in front of the Buttigieg campaign bus, holding one child in each arm. \u201cWow, you\u2019ve got your hands full,\u201d Mr. Buttigieg told her before pausing for a picture. Parents interviewed at a range of campaign events said they often felt like this political moment resembled a tawdry reality TV show, and they brought their children to see the 2020 candidates to try to demonstrate to them that politics can be something different. \u201cI can\u2019t let my kids listen to the TV without being ready to hit the mute button,\u201d said Julia Privett, a physician assistant who brought her 2-year-old daughter, Alyssa, to see Mr. Biden talk about climate change in Cedar Rapids. Lytishya Borglum, a Cedar Falls small business owner, brought her three middle-school-aged children to see Senator Kamala Harris of California speak at the University of Northern Iowa. She\u2019d taken her oldest daughter, 13-year-old Berlyn, to see Democratic caucus campaign events in 2008, but skipped 2016 because it was too toxic. \u201cNowadays, it\u2019s impossible for them not to be exposed to the craziness in the White House,\u201d Ms. Borglum said. At Ms. Warren\u2019s Iowa City rally, a parade of children waited with their parents for a picture with the senator. Kohner Reynolds, who will turn 2 in November, blew past his 7:30 p.m. bedtime. \u201cHe fell asleep a couple times in the baby carrier,\u201d said Kohner\u2019s mother, Callie Reynolds. \u201cI wanted him to be able to say he came to see her.\u201d Burgundy Johnson, a child psychologist, kept her 5-month-old son, Archer, up past his 8 o\u2019clock bedtime. She occupied Archer with toys. \u201cI wanted a picture of Elizabeth Warren holding my baby,\u201d she said while leaving the event at 8:40 p.m. \u201cNow it\u2019s going to be an interesting night.\u201d The older children tend to be more attuned to issues. Evelynn Parlet, 11, an Iowa City sixth grader, said she approved of Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign goal of reordering the American economy. \u201cI liked what she said,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to help people who don\u2019t have enough money.\u201d Samara and Isa Murillo, sisters who are 10 and 8 years old, each had Ms. Warren autograph a white campaign placard. Ms. Warren got down on one knee and signed them on the floor of the stage. \u201cWe love her ideas about change and the two cents,\u201d Samara said. \u201cPeople out there are dying of hunger.\u201d Isa said she was more focused on climate change. \u201cSome people don\u2019t have homes because of the flooding,\u201d she said. And, because it is Iowa, there are parents who spend caucus season vying to get their children photographed with all of the candidates they can \u2014 just in case one of them makes it to the White House. Eric Heininger, a fund-raiser for nonprofit organizations, and his wife, Tiffani Milless, a physician, toted their 9-month-old daughter, Charlotte, around the Polk County Steak Fry last month to get her in pictures with as many contenders as possible. Dressed in a red-white-and-blue sundress, Charlotte met Ms. Warren, Mr. Buttigieg, Mr. O\u2019Rourke and the entrepreneur Andrew Yang. At earlier campaign events, she was photographed with Mr. Sanders, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey and former Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado, who ended his campaign in August. With Charlotte sleeping on her father\u2019s chest, Dr. Milless filled out a card committing to caucus for Mr. O\u2019Rourke and held it up while the Texan offered his toothy smile. \u201cThank you so much,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke said, gently patting the sleeping child on her back. A campaign aide took Dr. Milless\u2019s caucus card and stuffed it into a backpack. Afterward, Dr. Milless said she had only filled out the card in order to secure the picture with her daughter. \u201cHe\u2019s in my top three,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a loose commitment, kind of like a promise ring.\u201d",

      "content": " Welcome to Poll Watch, our weekly look at polling data and survey research on the candidates, voters and issues that will shape the 2020 election. After next week\u2019s Democratic debate, pundits will inevitably argue over who won and who lost, and they\u2019ll scour the polls to see if any presidential candidate has gotten a \u201cbump\u201d in support. But as high-profile as they are, debates rarely help a candidate break out of a crowded field. And strategists generally agree that post-debate spikes in the polls seldom last for long. A dozen candidates will be onstage at the CNN/New York Times debate on Tuesday, but experts broadly agree that none of them are likely to see a significant change in fortunes in a single night. Ahead of the 2016 Republican primaries, Donald J. Trump\u2019s publicity-heavy campaign rolled along with impregnable strength, despite the fact that TV viewers rarely gave him high marks for his debate performances. The current Democratic race has been characterized by a similar steadiness, experts say, with former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. continuing to command the support of around a quarter of Democratic respondents, and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts rising consistently and sometimes surpassing him. \u201cDemocratic primary voters basically seem to be fine with their top three options,\u201d said Sean McElwee, a co-founder of the polling and analytics firm Data for Progress, referring to Mr. Biden, Ms. Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. \u201cThere\u2019s the possibility that a debate would drive a news cycle that would bolster a candidate,\u201d Mr. McElwee added. \u201cBut instead, what we\u2019ve seen is that those sorts of moments tend to fall off.\u201d Senator Kamala Harris of California is the only Democratic candidate this cycle who has seen a statistically significant jolt in the polls after a debate. At the first round of Democratic debates in late June, she confronted Mr. Biden on his past opposition to federally mandated school busing. She immediately leapt up in the polls, enjoying double-digit support among primary voters nationwide throughout July. Perhaps more important, the exchange gave her fund-raising operation a shot of adrenaline: Just 24 hours after the debate, she had raised $2 million. But she soon fell from the race\u2019s top tier, and has not broken into the double digits in any major national poll since the start of August. Mr. McElwee cited recent studies showing that candidates\u2019 success is strongly driven by the sheer amount of news coverage they manage to receive \u2014 an argument that was borne out by the success of Mr. Trump in the run-up to the 2016 primaries, when he was able to reverse the unfavorable opinions that most Republican voters held of him, not by changing the tenor of his campaign, but by securing almost nonstop coverage. \u201cThere are lots of different earned-media opportunities in the current climate \u2014 and debates are very important,\u201d Mr. McElwee said. \u201cBut if you look at the polling, there\u2019s been lots of people who have had good debates, bad debates, and at the end of the day, it hasn\u2019t really changed the broad structure of the race.\u201d \u201cIn the broad scope of cable news coverage, the one hit per month of the debate is not enough to make a candidate break through,\u201d he added. The Democratic pollster Celinda Lake said that debates can help drive future coverage, resulting in a snowball effect. But she added that candidates\u2019 fortunes will largely be determined on the ground in early-voting states. \u201cI think that honestly, the debates are having more impact on news coverage than they are having impact on voters,\u201d Ms. Lake said. \u201cCandidates don\u2019t get known by unveiling a good plan at the debate. They become known by immersing themselves in these early states.\u201d To qualify for November\u2019s debate, candidates will need to reach 5 percent support in two polls in early nominating states, or 3 percent in four early-state or national polls. These are higher thresholds than for any debate thus far. A bump after next week\u2019s debate could, at the very least, help candidates such as Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota or the former housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro \u2014 who are now foundering in the low single digits \u2014 secure a spot onstage next month. But historically, early debates have been more likely to disqualify a candidate than to provide a lasting jolt of momentum. In 2011, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas pledged in an early debate to eliminate three agencies from the executive branch if elected president but couldn\u2019t remember the name of one of the agencies. He never recovered from the flub. (When Mr. Trump became president, however, Mr. Perry was chosen to head the Department of Energy, the very agency he had forgotten to name.) Last election cycle, the businesswoman Carly Fiorina enjoyed a strong showing in the second Republican primary debate, seeing a sizable uptick in support in the days afterward. But she could not convert it into a consistent climb in the polls. \u201cSuccessful first debate performances create buzz for a candidate but also generate expectations for continued success,\u201d the historian and presidential scholar Bruce Buchanan wrote in an email. \u201cIf he or she does O.K. but less well in the second debate, the story is about underperformance.\u201d Bob Shrum, a Democratic strategist and speechwriter, said that Ms. Warren had found success by performing strongly in debates \u2014 while not chasing a breakout moment. \u201cShe has done this by performing consistently well by not looking for a cute line, and my guess is that she\u2019ll continue that,\u201d he said. But Mr. Shrum noted that as the field of candidates narrows, and the remaining candidates each get more airtime, the opportunity for news-making moments will increase. \u201cThese early debates are more like skirmishes,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re now getting into the later debates \u2014 and they can have an impact.\u201d It may not be until the general election that the debate stage once again assumes prime importance. \u201cPrimary debates are more like a beauty contest or a cameo appearance in a play,\u201d Peter Hart, a longtime Democratic pollster, said. \u201cIt gives you a glimpse, it gives you an insight, and it allows a candidate to get noticed. More importantly, it can eliminate a candidate\u2019s potential to be the nominee.\u201d On the other hand, he said, \u201cgeneral election debates have a huge impact upon the dynamics of the election \u2014 and the outcome.\u201d",

Schmidt, Ben Protess, Kenneth P. Vogel and William K. RashbaumPRINT EDITIONGiuliani Being Investigated Over His Work in Ukraine|October 12, 2019, Page A1",
      "author": "Michael S. Schmidt",
      "content": "    WASHINGTON \u2014 Federal prosecutors in Manhattan are investigating whether President Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani broke lobbying laws in his dealings in Ukraine, according to two people familiar with the inquiry. The investigators are examining Mr. Giuliani\u2019s efforts to undermine the American ambassador to Ukraine, Marie L. Yovanovitch, one of the people said. She was recalled in the spring as part of Mr. Trump\u2019s broader campaign to pressure Ukraine into helping his political prospects. The investigation into Mr. Giuliani is tied to the case against two of his associates who were arrested this week on campaign finance-related charges, the people familiar with the inquiry said. The associates were charged with funneling illegal contributions to a congressman whose help they sought in removing Ms. Yovanovitch. Mr. Giuliani has denied wrongdoing, but he acknowledged that he and the associates worked with Ukrainian prosecutors to collect potentially damaging information about Ms. Yovanovitch and other targets of Mr. Trump and his allies, including former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his younger son, Hunter Biden. Mr. Giuliani shared that material this year with American government officials and a Trump-friendly columnist in an effort to undermine the ambassador and other Trump targets. Federal law requires American citizens to disclose to the Justice Department any contacts with the government or media in the United States at the direction or request of foreign politicians or government officials, regardless of whether they pay for the representation. Law enforcement officials have made clear in recent years that covert foreign influence is as great a threat to the country as spies trying to steal government secrets. A criminal investigation of Mr. Giuliani raises the stakes of the Ukraine scandal for the president, whose dealings with the country are already the subject of an impeachment inquiry. It is also a stark turn for Mr. Giuliani, who now finds himself under scrutiny from the same United States attorney\u2019s office he led in the 1980s, when he first rose to prominence as a tough-on-crime prosecutor and later ascended to two terms as mayor of New York. It was unclear how far the investigation has progressed, and there was no indication that prosecutors in Manhattan have decided to file additional charges in the case. A spokeswoman for the United States attorney in Manhattan, Geoffrey S. Berman, declined to comment. Mr. Giuliani said that federal prosecutors had no grounds to charge him with foreign lobbying disclosure violations because he said he was acting on behalf of Mr. Trump, not the Ukrainian prosecutor, Yuriy Lutsenko, when he collected the information on Ms. Yovanovitch and the others and relayed it to the American government and the news media. \u201cLook, you can try to contort anything into anything, but if they have any degree of objectivity or fairness, it would be kind of ridiculous to say I was doing it on Lutsenko\u2019s behalf when I was representing the president of the United States,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said. Mr. Lutsenko had chafed at Ms. Yovanovitch\u2019s anticorruption efforts and wanted her recalled from Kiev. Mr. Giuliani also said he was unaware of any investigation into him, and he defended the pressure campaign on Ukrainians, which he led, as legal and above board. CNN and other news organizations reported that federal prosecutors were scrutinizing Mr. Giuliani\u2019s financial dealings with his associates, but it has not been previously reported that federal prosecutors in Manhattan are specifically investigating whether he violated foreign lobbying laws in his work in Ukraine. Ms. Yovanovitch told impeachment investigators on Friday that Mr. Trump had pressed for her removal for months even though the State Department believed she had \u201cdone nothing wrong.\u201d Mr. Giuliani had receded from the spotlight in recent years while he built a brisk international consulting business, including work in Ukraine. But he re-emerged in the center of the political stage last year, when Mr. Trump retained him for the special counsel\u2019s investigation into Russian election interference. Russia\u2019s sabotage also ushered in a new focus at the Justice Department on enforcing the laws regulating foreign influence that had essentially sat dormant for a half-century and under which Mr. Giuliani is now being investigated. Mr. Giuliani said that because Democrats had questioned his business consulting for foreign clients, his contracts explicitly say he does not lobby or act as an agent of foreigners. Through his two associates who also worked to oust the ambassador, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, Mr. Giuliani connected early this year with Mr. Lutsenko, who served as Ukraine\u2019s top prosecutor until August. Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman had previously connected Mr. Giuliani to Mr. Lutsenko\u2019s predecessor, Viktor Shokin, late last year. Mr. Parnas had told people that Ms. Yovanovitch was stymieing his efforts to pursue gas business in Ukraine. Mr. Parnas also told people that one of his companies had paid Mr. Giuliani hundreds of thousands of dollars for an unrelated American business venture, and Mr. Giuliani said he advised Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman on a Ukrainian dispute. Mr. Lutsenko had sought to relay the information he had collected on Mr. Trump\u2019s targets to American law enforcement agencies and saw Mr. Giuliani as someone who could make that happen. Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Lutsenko initially spoke over the phone and then met in person in New York in January. Mr. Lutsenko initially asked Mr. Giuliani to represent him, according to the former mayor, who said he declined because it would have posed a conflict with his work for the president. Instead, Mr. Giuliani said, he interviewed Mr. Lutsenko for hours, then had one of his employees \u2014 a \u201cprofessional investigator who works for my company\u201d \u2014 write memos detailing the Ukrainian prosecutors\u2019 claims about Ms. Yovanovitch, Mr. Biden and others. Mr. Giuliani said he provided those memos to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo this year and was told that the State Department passed the memos to the F.B.I. He did not say who told him. Mr. Giuliani said he also gave the memos to the columnist, John Solomon, who worked at the time for The Hill newspaper and published articles and videos critical of Ms. Yovanovitch, the Bidens and other Trump targets. It was unclear to what degree Mr. Giuliani\u2019s memos served as fodder for Mr. Solomon, who independently interviewed Mr. Lutsenko and other sources. Mr. Solomon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The lobbying disclosure law contains an exemption for legal work, and Mr. Giuliani said his efforts to unearth information and push both for investigations in Ukraine and for news coverage of his findings originated with his defense of Mr. Trump in the special counsel\u2019s investigation. He acknowledged that his work morphed into a more general dragnet for dirt on Mr. Trump\u2019s targets but said that it was difficult to separate those lines of inquiry from his original mission of discrediting the origins of the special counsel\u2019s investigation. Mr. Giuliani said Mr. Lutsenko never specifically asked him to try to force Ms. Yovanovitch\u2019s recall, saying he concluded himself that Mr. Lutsenko probably wanted her fired because he had complained that she was stifling his investigations. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say to me, \u2018I came here to get Yovanovitch fired.\u2019 He came here because he said he had been trying to transmit this information to your government for the past year, and had been unable to do it,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said of his meeting in New York with Mr. Lutsenko. \u201cI transmitted the information to the right people.\u201d The president sought to distance himself earlier on Friday from Mr. Giuliani, saying he was uncertain when asked whether Mr. Giuliani still represented him. \u201cI haven\u2019t spoken to Rudy,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters. \u201cI spoke to him yesterday quickly. He is a very good attorney and he has been my attorney.\u201d Mr. Giuliani later said that he still represented Mr. Trump. The recall of the ambassador and the efforts by Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani to push for investigations in Ukraine have emerged as the focus of House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump. The impeachment was prompted by a whistle-blower complaint about Mr. Trump pressing President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine in a July phone call to pursue investigations that could help Mr. Trump\u2019s 2020 re-election campaign. At the time, the Trump administration had frozen $391 million in military assistance to Ukraine for its fight against Russian-backed separatists. The State Department\u2019s inspector general has turned over to House impeachment investigators a packet of materials including the memos containing notes of Mr. Giuliani\u2019s interviews with Mr. Lutsenko and Mr. Shokin. The investigation into Mr. Giuliani is the latest to scrutinize one of Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers. His former personal lawyer and fixer, Michael D. Cohen, implicated the president when he pleaded guilty last year to making hush payments during the 2016 campaign to women who claimed affairs with Mr. Trump, which he has denied. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan mentioned Mr. Trump as \u201cIndividual 1\u201d in court papers but never formally accused him of wrongdoing.",

      "author": "Alexander Burns",
      "content": " With a crucial debate looming next week in the Democratic presidential primary, the party\u2019s populist wing appears increasingly in control of the race \u2014 rising in the polls, stocked with cash and with only a wounded leading candidate, Joseph R. Biden Jr., standing in its way. Several slow-building trends have converged to upend the race over the last few weeks: Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s steady ascent in the polls has accelerated. Both she and Senator Bernie Sanders, a fellow progressive, have raised immense sums of money from small donors online, dominating the Democratic field and each collecting about $10 million more than Mr. Biden in the last quarter. And Mr. Biden\u2019s numbers have gradually slipped in a way that has alarmed his supporters. The race is far from over: All three of the top candidates \u2014 Ms. Warren, Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders \u2014 have a path to victory, and there is still time for longer-shot candidates to make a real run at the nomination. The CNN/New York Times debate in Ohio on Tuesday is likely to test Ms. Warren\u2019s status as an emerging front-runner, subjecting her to new criticism from her fellow Democrats on matters ranging from health care policy to trade and the role of the government in overseeing the economy. Above all, she may need to allay lingering reservations about her appeal to swing voters in the general election. And Mr. Biden signaled on Thursday night that he will come into the debate fighting. \u201cOne of the problems I\u2019m finding, I\u2019ve got to be more aggressive,\u201d he said at a fund-raiser in Los Angeles. He then used a roundabout example to explain that debate time restraints don\u2019t allow time for lengthy answers. \u201cWhen someone says, you know, you know, \u2018Are you still beating your wife?\u2019 And, and I go, \u2018I have a long explanation,\u2019 and they say, \u2018You got 30 seconds to answer.\u2019 And you say, \u2018No. And then, wait a minute, what\u2019d I just say? No, I\u2019m not still beating my wife.\u2019 But so, I\u2019ve had, I\u2019ve had some difficulties,\u201d he said. If Tuesday\u2019s debate could break in any number of directions, what may be resolved is the overall mood of Democratic primary voters, and whether they are more inclined to seek a politically cautious nominee who promises to restore normalcy in Washington, or a more confrontational standard-bearer with an ambitious and disruptive reform agenda. It is candidates in the latter category who now control the bulk of the financial might in the race, and are best positioned in most of the early primary states. Anna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster who is not aligned in the primary, said an \u201canti-establishment\u201d current had plainly taken hold, with voters rewarding candidates for defying the conventional limits of political debate and \u201cpushing boundaries in really productive ways.\u201d She pointed not only to Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders but also to former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke, who has embraced a new political identity for himself as a gun-control activist and a critic of his own party\u2019s relatively cautious platform on the issue. \u201cAcross the board, whether it\u2019s Beto talking about assault weapons or Warren and Sanders talking about Wall Street,\u201d Ms. Greenberg said, \u201cit does feel like there is a shift in the party that is kind of new.\u201d Ms. Greenberg said there was still space for Mr. Biden to run a strong campaign because of the way voters perceive his values and character. Americans, she said, believe Mr. Biden \u201ccares about people and working class people, regular people, and that\u2019s not an insignificant asset.\u201d Yet it has been Ms. Warren, rather than Mr. Biden, who has consistently gained strength. Campaigning on a message of purging corruption in Washington and restructuring the economy, Ms. Warren has closed Mr. Biden\u2019s lead in the polls every week since the beginning of the summer and is now in a position to upset him in both Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two states to vote. Mr. Biden remains a strong contender for the nomination, largely because of the support he collects from African-American voters. But he has struggled for months to articulate a clear vision for the future and has relied heavily on Democratic nostalgia for the Obama administration. In recent weeks, he has been consumed in a grisly political clash with President Trump. So far, the support Mr. Biden has lost does not seem to have gone to another moderate, like Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. Only Ms. Warren has been moving up in the national polls, suggesting either that Mr. Biden\u2019s lost supporters have defected to her camp or that they have become undecided altogether. If Ms. Warren has become the leading liberal standard-bearer, Mr. Sanders has been a steady third in national polls and his fund-raising power is likely to keep him among the most formidable competitors in the race. Yet his campaign has been grappling with the implications of Mr. Sanders\u2019s heart attack in Las Vegas last week, a medical emergency that landed him in the hospital and has kept him off the trail for days. He has sent mixed signals about his path forward, first indicating that he would scale back his campaign schedule and then defiantly reversing that suggestion. It is unclear whether Mr. Sanders\u2019s physical condition will affect his poll numbers: He has a solid base of support nationally and few other candidates believe his core followers will be easily dislodged. There is at least a new degree of uncertainty about whether he will be in a strong position to vie for liberal Democrats who have already been migrating toward Ms. Warren. Nearly all of the candidates feel pressure to do something in the Ohio debate to stop the race from becoming a contest entirely defined by a Warren-Biden rivalry, either by inflicting direct damage on Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign or by outflanking her as an alternative to Mr. Biden. The ongoing impeachment inquiry targeting Mr. Trump has only added to the pressure on the Democratic field, since the tumult in Washington is likely to leave voters with even less time to devote to reviewing underdog options. Mr. Buttigieg in particular has been moving assertively in recent weeks to position himself as a center-left alternative to both Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren, using his considerable war chest to run television ads in Iowa. Several other candidates of different ideological stripes are counting on Iowa for a breakthrough, including Senators Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Amy Klobuchar. A wild-card joining them onstage will be a new contender, Tom Steyer, a former hedge fund investor who has spent lavishly from his personal fortune to brand himself as a reform-minded outsider. For Ms. Warren, meanwhile, the debate may help reveal whether she can consolidate her gains across the Democratic Party. On Wednesday, she campaigned in South Carolina, where she has so far struggled to gain traction with the African-American voters who largely decide the primary there. To cement her status as a front-runner, she may have to win over a range of constituencies torn between their interest in her ideas and a more cautious political calculus that draws them to Mr. Biden. One of those voters is Ohio\u2019s former governor, Ted Strickland, the only Democrat to hold that office this century. Like many Democratic voters, Mr. Strickland, a populist with close ties to organized labor, said he saw Mr. Biden as the safer bet for the general election but found it hard to resist the appeal of Ms. Warren\u2019s proposals, most of all her plan for a new tax on vast private fortunes. \u201cI think there may be something to the electability issue for Mr. Biden, in Ohio,\u201d Mr. Strickland said. \u201cBut if I could just choose to put someone in the presidency \u2014 if that was my choice alone \u2014 it would be hard for me to pass up Elizabeth Warren.\u201d Mr. Strickland said he had spoken with Mr. Biden recently and saw him as a seasoned diplomat and a reliable \u201ceconomic progressive.\u201d But Ms. Warren, he said, was gradually easing voters\u2019 reservations about her ability to go up against Mr. Trump by talking about policy issues \u201cin ways that are easily understood.\u201d Mr. Biden remains a clear favorite in just one of the early states, South Carolina, and his advisers have predicted that he would fare better in larger, more diverse states that vote later in the calendar. He is counting, in particular, on older and more moderate African-American voters to hold back the party from stampeding toward a more ideological liberal candidate. In 2016, black and Latino voters helped Hillary Clinton withstand a persistent primary challenge from Mr. Sanders. Yet scattered polling in the later states has largely followed the national trend: Last week, for instance, the Public Policy Institute of California released a poll finding a statistical three-way tie in the nation\u2019s most populous state between Mr. Biden, Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders. Mark Baldassare, president of the institute, said there was no indication in his poll that the state\u2019s diversity would represent a stumbling block for candidates on the left, as Mr. Biden is hoping. The primary debates would be crucial to determining Ms. Warren\u2019s continued momentum, he said, because voters seemed to be using them for insight into the general election. \u201cIt has become kind of a proxy for: How are these candidates going to do when they stand up next to Trump?\u201d Mr. Baldassare said. \u201cI think this will be Elizabeth Warren\u2019s moment now, because if she is in the mix for front-runner, people are going to be testing her and seeing: How does she do? How does she do when she has to be on defense?\u201d",

      "content": " ROCHESTER, N.H. \u2014 Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Wednesday called for President Trump\u2019s impeachment for the first time, blistering Mr. Trump as a threat to American democracy and accusing him of \u201cshooting holes in the Constitution.\u201d Escalating his language in an effort to rebut Mr. Trump\u2019s unfounded claims about his actions with Ukraine, Mr. Biden set aside months of restraint to demand Congress move against the president. \u201cTo preserve our Constitution, our democracy, our basic integrity, he should be impeached,\u201d the former vice president told supporters here, accusing Mr. Trump of having \u201cbetrayed this nation.\u201d Mr. Biden even linked Mr. Trump\u2019s false claims to the so-called Big Lie idea promulgated by the Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels. \u201cYou say it long enough, often enough, people may believe it,\u201d he said, invoking Goebbels by name. While Mr. Biden stopped short of calling for Mr. Trump\u2019s removal from office, his new aggressiveness marked an acknowledgment that he must do more to both confront a president who is attacking him daily and to halt his slide in the polls in the Democratic primary. The former vice president has openly wrestled with how forceful to be with Mr. Trump, lamenting last week that the president wants to drag opponents into \u201ca mud fight.\u201d But Mr. Biden is increasingly sharpening his rhetoric under pressure from allies to embrace the head-to-head race. Mr. Trump is facing an impeachment inquiry in the House because of his request to the Ukrainian government that it look into what Mr. Biden did with the country when his son, Hunter Biden, was working for a gas company there. On Wednesday, Mr. Biden again denied that he did anything improper as vice president. And he accused Mr. Trump, who has accused Mr. Biden of corruption and whose campaign is airing ads repeating the same claim, of acting entirely out of a desire to undermine his candidacy. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to let Donald Trump pick the Democratic nominee for president, period,\u201d said Mr. Biden, who has fallen behind Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts in a series of national and early nominating state polls. \u201cHe\u2019s picked a fight with the wrong guy.\u201d The president apparently watched the speech, or was told of it, because even before it was over he noted on Twitter that Mr. Biden had called for his impeachment and claimed the Bidens had \u201cripped off at least two countries for millions of dollars.\u201d \u201cJoe\u2019s Failing Campaign gave him no other choice!\u201d wrote Mr. Trump. There is no evidence that Hunter Biden made millions of dollars from his overseas work or that his father intervened inappropriately with Ukraine or China, the other country Mr. Trump was alluding to in his tweet. The president has also urged China to look into the Bidens. Mr. Biden again denied that he did anything improper as vice president. He noted that his 2016 call to fire Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin, was part of United States government policy under President Barack Obama. It also reflected the wishes of a group of Republican senators at the time, who sought Mr. Shokin\u2019s ouster because he was seen as unwilling to target corruption, Mr. Biden said. A longtime senator before he became vice president, Mr. Biden is deferential to congressional prerogatives and has resisted calling for impeachment, even as Ms. Warren and many of his other Democratic rivals have been outspoken in demanding it. Last month, when House Democrats began moving toward an impeachment inquiry, he said they should only do so if Mr. Trump did not cooperate with their investigation. Then last week he said he would let Congress \u201cdo its job on impeachment.\u201d And at a later event on Wednesday, in Manchester, N.H., he nodded to his longstanding discomfort with impeachment, calling it \u201ca God-awful thing for a nation to go through.\u201d But as Mr. Trump and his allies wage near-daily political warfare against Mr. Biden, he has sought to mount a counteroffensive. He began his rebuttal in a speech last week in Reno, Nev., but on Wednesday he went even further. Speaking from a teleprompter and dressed formally in suit and tie, he used his first trip back to New Hampshire since the impeachment investigation got underway to both taunt and condemn Mr. Trump in remarkably stark language. \u201cHe\u2019s afraid about just how badly I will beat him next November,\u201d said Mr. Biden, attempting to frame the general election as a contest between him and the president, and appealing to Democratic voters here and elsewhere who are consumed with finding a nominee who can oust Mr. Trump. But he also used his speech, which lasted just under 30 minutes, to warn of the damage he claimed Mr. Trump was doing to the country. \u201cWe all laughed when he said could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot someone and get away with it,\u201d said Mr. Biden. \u201cIt\u2019s no joke. He\u2019s shooting holes in the Constitution, and we cannot let him get away with it.\u201d He argued that impeachment was crucial not just because of what the president had done but also in trying to curb Mr. Trump from committing additional abuses in office. For Mr. Biden, the question now is how to balance countering Mr. Trump\u2019s onslaught with articulating his own policy vision and contrasting himself with his Democratic opponents. He sought to do all three in his appearance in Manchester, reciting many of his same lines about Mr. Trump at the outset of his speech before turning to his record on gun control and domestic violence prevention. \u201cIt takes a proven ability to get things done,\u2019\u2019 he said. And, he reminded the audience in an unmistakable reference to Ms. Warren\u2019s raft of policy plans, \u201cWe\u2019re not electing a planner.\u201d",

      "content": " It\u2019s hard to imagine, but this seemingly fast-moving impeachment inquiry may actually be in a \u201clull\u201d because Congress has been on recess. Well, Congress is back in session on Tuesday, so read on and get educated before things really take off. The White House said on Tuesday that it would not cooperate with what it called an illegitimate effort \u201cto overturn the results of the 2016 election.\u201d In a letter to those leading the inquiry, White House officials said the \u201ctransparent rush to judgment, lack of democratically accountable authorization and violation of basic rights in the current proceedings make clear the illegitimate, partisan purpose of this purported \u2018impeachment inquiry.\u2019\u201d The White House\u2019s refusal to cooperate, breathtaking in scope and defiant in tone, amounts to an unabashed challenge to America\u2019s longstanding constitutional order, writes Peter Baker, our chief White House correspondent. The letter came shortly after the White House blocked the interview of a key witness, Gordon D. Sondland, the American ambassador to the European Union, hours before he was to appear on Capitol Hill. On Friday, Mr. Sondland said he would comply with a House subpoena and testify next week. ____ Federal prosecutors in Manhattan are investigating whether President Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, broke lobbying laws in his dealings in Ukraine, according to two people familiar with the inquiry. The investigators are examining Mr. Giuliani\u2019s efforts to undermine the American ambassador to Ukraine, Marie L. Yovanovitch, one of the people said. She was recalled in the spring as part of Mr. Trump\u2019s broader campaign to pressure Ukraine into helping his political prospects. The investigation into Mr. Giuliani is tied to the case against two of his associates who were arrested this past week on campaign finance-related charges, the people familiar with the inquiry said. The associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Furman, were charged with funneling illegal contributions to a congressman whose help they had sought in removing Ms. Yovanovitch. Here\u2019s a guide to the Ukraine saga\u2019s growing cast of characters. Ms. Yovanovitch told impeachment investigators on Friday that a top State Department official had told her that Mr. Trump had pushed for her removal for months even though her employer, the State Department, believed she had \u201cdone nothing wrong.\u201d She dismissed as \u201cfictitious\u201d accusations that she had been disloyal to Mr. Trump, which she said had been circulated by allies of Mr. Giuliani. Ms. Yovanovitch, testifying in defiance of State Department orders and at risk of losing her job, delivered a scathing indictment of how the Trump administration conducts foreign policy, warning that private influence and personal gain have usurped diplomats\u2019 judgment and could undermine the nation\u2019s interests. Ms. Yovanovitch said of her time in Ukraine: \u201cOur efforts were intended, and evidently succeeded, in thwarting corrupt interests in Ukraine, who fought back by selling baseless conspiracy theories to anyone who would listen. Sadly, someone was listening, and our nation is the worse off for that.\u201d Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. added his voice to those calling for impeachment. He had previously been wary. Decades in the Senate and his involvement in two other impeachment inquiries (against Bill Clinton and Richard Nixon) explain his earlier reticence, writes Matt Flegenheimer, a reporter covering national politics. To keep up with developments on a daily basis, sign up for the Impeachment Briefing here. The energy secretary was asked for records that could shed light on any role he might have played in Mr. Trump\u2019s attempts to pressure the Ukrainian government. The Defense Department and the Office of Management and Budget also received subpoenas for documents about the Trump administration\u2019s decision to withhold $391 million in security aid for Ukraine. In the midst of the fight over the impeachment inquiry,  Mr. Trump threw Middle East policy into turmoil by vowing to withdraw American troops from northern Syria. The Syrian Kurds in that region have been fighting the Islamic State on the ground and are allied with American troops. To Turkey, though, the Kurds are a threat massing on its southern border. No longer restrained by the United States, Turkey launched a cross-border assault on Wednesday against the Syrian Kurds. Both Turkey and the Kurds are allies of the United States, so how did they get to this point? United States military forces and American politicians have expressed anguish and anger at the president\u2019s abandonment of the Syrian Kurds.",

      "author": "Annie Karni",
      "content": "  MINNEAPOLIS \u2014 A fired-up President Trump lashed out against Democrats at a combative campaign rally on Thursday night, deriding them as \u201cvery sick and deranged people\u201d who were only investigating him for abuse of power in order to \u201cerase your vote.\u201d Facing impeachment in the House, Mr. Trump took his case to his core supporters, arguing that Democrats were trying to overturn the 2016 election because they knew they could not beat him in 2020. He singled out former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. as nothing but a toady for President Barack Obama. \u201cHe was only a good vice president because he knew how to kiss Barack Obama\u2019s ass,\u201d Mr. Trump said, a line that drew huge roars of approval from the crowd. In his first campaign rally since Speaker Nancy Pelosi declared the formal beginning of an impeachment inquiry last month, Mr. Trump was as raw and rancorous as ever, targeting individual Democrats in highly personal terms that no president has used in public and presenting himself as a victim of a partisan conspiracy. \u201cFrom Day 1, the wretched Washington swamp has been trying to nullify the results of a truly great and democratic election,\u201d Mr. Trump told a crowd of about 20,000 at the Target Center in Minneapolis, one of the most Democratic cities in the country. \u201cThey want to erase your vote like it never existed; they want to erase your voice, and they want to erase your future.\u201d He fired off insults in rapid succession at F.B.I. agents, lawmakers and journalists who he said were out to get him. \u201cShe\u2019s either really stupid or she\u2019s really lost it \u2014 or maybe there\u2019s a certain dishonesty in there,\u201d he said of Ms. Pelosi. Representative Ilhan Omar, Democrat of Minnesota, who is one of his favorite targets, is an \u201cAmerica-hating socialist\u201d who married her brother in order to come into the country, he said. (No proof has emerged substantiating the marriage claim.) He went local in targeting the city\u2019s Democratic mayor, Jacob Frey, who drew the president\u2019s ire this week for seeking reimbursement for the cost of extra security required for the rally. \u201cYou got a rotten mayor,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to change your mayor.\u201d But no Democrat came under as much fire as Mr. Biden, one of the leading Democrats bidding to challenge him next year. It was Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure Ukraine\u2019s president to come up with damaging information about Mr. Biden that prompted the House impeachment inquiry that now threatens his presidency. Mr. Trump maintained he was interested only in uncovering supposed corruption by the former vice president and his younger son, Hunter Biden, who made $50,000 a month serving on the board of a Ukrainian energy company at the same time his father was working on Ukraine policy for the Obama administration. In scathing terms, Mr. Trump mocked Hunter Biden, who struggled for years with alcohol and drug abuse and was discharged from the Navy Reserve after failing a drug test. Calling him unqualified for the energy company post, Mr. Trump declared that Hunter Biden was \u201cnot too smart\u201d and added, \u201cHunter, you\u2019re a loser.\u201d He noted that Hunter Biden had been out of the public spotlight in the past couple of weeks as the president and his supporters have sought to make him a political liability for the former vice president. \u201cWhatever happened to Hunter?\u201d Mr. Trump demanded. \u201cWhere the hell is he? Where\u2019s Hunter?\u201d Turning to a group of supporters, the president said, \u201cHey, fellas, I have an idea for a new T-shirt.\u201d It should say, \u201cWhere\u2019s Hunter?\u201d he added. Mr. Trump was proudly on offense all night, cheerfully using the word \u201chell\u201d repeatedly while mocking those who say he should watch his language. \u201cI\u2019m energized,\u201d he told the crowd. At another point, he reveled in his ad hoc blasts at his enemies. \u201cIsn\u2019t it much better when I go off script?\u201d he asked. The rally, the first of three in the next week, came on a day of rapidly advancing developments in the impeachment inquiry and related matters. Energy Secretary Rick Perry was subpoenaed on Thursday for records that could shed light on any role he may have played in Mr. Trump\u2019s attempts to pressure the Ukrainian government. Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, two of associates of Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani, were indicted on campaign finance charges. And Mr. Trump told reporters that the man just announced as his outside counsel, Trey Gowdy, could not start in that position until January because of \u201clobbying rules,\u201d even as House Democrats hope to have an impeachment vote wrapped up by the holidays. Despite the fast-moving inquiry unfolding in Washington, Mr. Trump showed that he, too, was barreling forward in his re-election campaign, using impeachment as fuel to energize his hard-core supporters while trying to expand the electoral map. This time, his campaign is pouring resources into a state with the hopes of putting Democrats on defense and projecting confidence that they have more paths to re-election than simply recreating the winning map from 2016. Mr. Trump lost Minnesota by 1.5 percentage points to Hillary Clinton in 2016, despite having no campaign staff on the ground and barely setting foot in the state. \u201cWe are going to win this state,\u201d Mr. Trump said as he took the stage Thursday night. \u201cThis feels like the day before the election.\u201d The president\u2019s decision to visit Ms. Omar\u2019s backyard was also a show of confidence, challenging a local congresswoman in her home state. \u201cHow do you have such a person representing you in Minnesota?\u201d he asked the crowd, calling her one of the \u201cbig reasons\u201d that he would win re-election. He bemoaned the fact that so many Somali refugees had been allowed to resettle in Minnesota and boasted that he had closed the door to many foreigners seeking protection in the United States. \u201cI have reduced refugee resettlement by 85 percent,\u201d he said. Outside the Target Center, Trump protesters clashed with Trump supporters, their shouting and cursing escalating as the president took the stage. Many said the longtime Democratic state suddenly felt like a battleground, and strangers approached each other to pick fights. \u201cTell me why you like him,\u201d one man yelled at a nearby Trump supporter. Criticized by another protester for the president\u2019s white supremacist undertones, the Trump supporter replied, \u201cI could have 100 black people with me if I wanted to.\u201d Cameron Russell, 26, of Minneapolis, a donor support technician who is black, voiced his skepticism: \u201cYo, man \u2014 pull them up. Call them up.\u201d Then Mr. Russell recognized the Trump supporter, who is white, as a high school classmate. \u201cI thought you were cool,\u201d Mr. Russell said to him.",

      "content": "   Last month, the Trump family business received approval from a local government in Scotland for a major expansion of its golf resort near Aberdeen, marking the largest real estate development financed by the Trump Organization since the 2016 election. In August, President Trump\u2019s eldest son, Donald Jr., flew to Jakarta to help kick-start sales at a pair of Trump-branded luxury resorts planned for Indonesia. He appeared at a private event with wealthy prospective buyers and joined his politically connected billionaire Indonesian business partner at a news conference. And last year, Donald Jr. visited India to sell condos at future Trump-branded towers, appearing at an event that also featured India\u2019s prime minister. \u201cI\u2019m here as a businessman,\u201d Mr. Trump told the gathering in New Delhi. \u201cI\u2019m not representing anyone.\u201d But for the children of the politically powerful, personal business and public dealings can often be indistinguishable, especially when private projects depend on foreign governments that are looking to bolster ties with Washington. In recent weeks, as the president has become embroiled in a scandal involving his interactions with Ukraine, Donald Trump Jr. and his brother Eric have taken to attacking Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., for his business dealings in Ukraine and China. The brothers have accused him of leveraging his family name for personal gain while his father served in the Obama administration. Among other things, Hunter Biden was on the board of a Ukrainian energy company that has been a focus of Mr. Trump\u2019s interest in the country. \u201cAt the VERY LEAST, there\u2019s the appearance of impropriety,\u201d Donald Trump Jr. wrote on Twitter. \u201cA clear conflict of interest.\u201d At a rally in Minneapolis on Thursday, Eric Trump\u2019s charged remarks about the former vice president\u2019s son inspired the crowd of Trump supporters to chant, \u201cLock him up!\u201d Republicans, led by the president, have sought to make Hunter Biden\u2019s international business dealings an issue in the impeachment debate in Washington. But the high-profile attack roles being played by Mr. Trump\u2019s eldest sons have now thrust their own business dealings into the spotlight too. Both sons have operated and promoted the Trump family business overseas during their father\u2019s presidency, even as he retains ownership. And while the Trump and Biden father-son relationships differ in many ways, the business dealings have set up a simple parallel. \u201cThey are criticizing the vice president\u2019s son for doing exactly what they are doing themselves,\u201d said Martin Ford, a member of the Aberdeenshire Council in Scotland, which voted last month to approve a proposal by the Trumps to build a 500-unit housing development. \u201cThey are conducting international business here in Scotland.\u201d Eric Trump, in a statement to The New York Times, said there was a distinction between his father\u2019s career in business, with his recent turn to politics, and Mr. Biden\u2019s decades in public office. \u201cWhen my father became president, our family stopped doing international business deals,\u201d he said, a reference to a pledge by the Trump Organization not to begin new overseas projects during the Trump presidency. Hunter Biden, he said, did the opposite when his father became vice president. The Trump business activities in India, Indonesia and Scotland were considered in compliance with the pledge, according to the company\u2019s ethics rules, because they were building on deals already in the works. Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign declined to comment on Friday. But in a tweet, the former vice president once again suggested that the attacks on his son were part of a political smear campaign. \u201cLet me make something clear to President Trump: I\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d he wrote. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to destroy me. And you\u2019re not going to destroy my family. I don\u2019t care how dirty the attacks get.\u201d Conducting business on the international stage has long been standard for the Trump Organization, which has placed the Trump name on hotels and towers in several countries. But its international dealings have become far more complicated since Mr. Trump took office and his sons took leadership of the business, especially when foreign governments have been involved to the company\u2019s benefit. When the Trump Organization tangled with the majority owner of a property in Panama, for example, its local lawyers at one point called on the Panamanian president for an assist. In Indonesia, the government is helping to build a major new highway that will make a new Trump development more accessible. Construction is scheduled to begin soon on what will be known as Trump Residences Lido, which will include 280 homes, a golf course and a hotel, south of Jakarta. The Trump family\u2019s partner in Indonesia \u2014 a billionaire named Hary Tanoesoedibjo \u2014 is financing the project, with the Trump family getting a cut of the sales. In marketing materials released this summer, which featured the Trump family logo and a photograph of Donald Trump Jr., the company noted that the \u201cTrump Residences Lido can be accessed directly through the newly opened Bocimi Toll Road.\u201d In Scotland, the Aberdeenshire Council recently dropped an earlier requirement that the new housing development could not be built until the Trumps spent tens of millions of dollars on other investments at the resort. Sebastian Leslie, a local official who supported the project, said the family received no special consideration. \u201cWe don\u2019t do that \u2014 we don\u2019t give anybody special favors,\u201d Mr. Leslie said. But Mr. Martin, a council member who opposed the approval, said the Trumps benefited handsomely from the change. \u201cIt is a much, much more lucrative deal now,\u201d he said. Revenues coming to the Trump family in the United States have drawn scrutiny too, including at the Trump International Hotel in Washington \u2014 a property, opened in the final stages of the 2016 campaign, that has flourished while Donald Trump Jr. and Eric have run the company. The hotel has been a magnet for Republican lobbyists and political fund-raisers, and companies and foreign officials with business before the Trump administration have thrown parties there, including the Kuwait embassy and the government of Azerbaijan. Mr. Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka has also retained a stake in the family business even as she serves as a White House adviser, and last year she received trademarks in China related to her separate fashion ventures. Her husband, Jared Kushner, a senior adviser to the president, maintains a stake in his own family\u2019s real estate business, which has received and sought funding from international sources as well. In 2017, Mr. Kushner met privately at the White House with top executives from Citibank and the private equity firm Apollo Global Management. Those meetings came as the firms were contemplating sizable loans to his family\u2019s business, Kushner Companies, which they did eventually make. And since Mr. Kushner entered the White House, his family has courted state-connected investors in China and the Middle East \u2014 both regions that were in Mr. Kushner\u2019s government portfolio \u2014 to bail out the firm\u2019s headquarters at 666 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. But the presidency has also come with some costs for the Trump family business since the sons have been at the helm. The company had been banking on global expansion to drive its growth, but when the president agreed to put a hold on new foreign deals, it curtailed those ambitions for his sons. George Sorial, the company\u2019s chief compliance counsel when the policy was developed, said it was the right thing to do even though it was not required by law and had cost the company significantly. Eric Trump, in his statement to The Times, suggested that even the decision to forgo new foreign deals could be seen through the prism of Hunter Biden. \u201cMy father was one of the most famous businessmen on earth and he sacrificed billions to be our president,\u201d he said. \u201cJoe Biden was an incredibly influential politician \u2014 his family made millions.\u201d The Biden campaign also sees opportunity in the nasty dispute. In a fund-raising email sent on Friday, the campaign singled out the Trump sons and the \u201clock him up\u201d chant at the Thursday rally. \u201cWe are fighting back against this nonsense as hard as we know how every single day,\u201d the campaign wrote.",

Vogel and Maggie HabermanPRINT EDITIONShowing Support, Trump Talks to Giuliani Over Lunch|October 13, 2019, Page A24",
      "author": "Kenneth P. Vogel",
      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump had lunch on Saturday with Rudolph W. Giuliani amid revelations that prosecutors were investigating Mr. Giuliani for possible lobbying violations, and speculation that his position as the president\u2019s personal lawyer was in jeopardy. The lunch, at Mr. Trump\u2019s golf course in Sterling, Va., was among several shows of the president\u2019s support for Mr. Giuliani on Saturday. They seemed meant to tamp down questions about Mr. Giuliani\u2019s status with a client famous for distancing himself from advisers when they encounter legal problems of their own. Mr. Trump, during a Saturday night appearance on Fox News, called Mr. Giuliani \u201ca great gentleman\u201d and said he is still his lawyer. \u201cI know nothing about him being under investigation. I can\u2019t imagine it,\u201d he told the host Jeanine Pirro. Before the lunch, Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Trump spoke on the phone, according to two people familiar with the discussions. Also beforehand, Mr. Trump praised Mr. Giuliani on Twitter as a \u201clegendary \u2018crime buster\u2019 and greatest Mayor in the history of NYC.\u201d Mr. Giuliani \u201cmay seem a little rough around the edges sometimes, but he is also a great guy and wonderful lawyer,\u201d the president\u2019s tweet continued. And Mr. Trump dismissed the investigation into Mr. Giuliani as a \u201ca one sided Witch Hunt\u201d carried out by the \u201cDeep State.\u201d The president echoed language he had used to minimize the special counsel\u2019s investigation into whether he or his campaign worked with Russians who interfered in the 2016 election to try to help him win the presidency. Mr. Giuliani, a former federal prosecutor and New York mayor, was retained last year to help defend the president in the special counsel\u2019s investigation. But his efforts to undermine the investigation\u2019s origins and its conclusions  helped lead Mr. Trump into an impeachment inquiry. The inquiry focuses on whether Mr. Trump, with assistance from Mr. Giuliani, abused the presidency to pressure Ukraine to pursue investigations for his political benefit, including into whether Ukrainians played a role in spurring the inquiry of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan are now investigating whether Mr. Giuliani\u2019s efforts in Ukraine may have run afoul of the Foreign Agents Registration Act, or FARA, The New York Times reported on Friday. Mr. Giuliani has defended his work in Ukraine and said it did not require him to register under FARA. Mr. Trump was not enamored with the negative publicity around Mr. Giuliani, people close to the president said, but he remains loyal because of his lawyer\u2019s willingness to aggressively defend him during the special counsel\u2019s inquiry. It is not clear what was discussed at the lunch. The lunch is unlikely to end speculation over whether the president will ultimately consider Mr. Giuliani a liability. Another of Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyers, Michael D. Cohen, met privately with the president in Florida in March 2018, a month before the F.B.I. searched his home, hotel room and office. Mr. Trump publicly embraced Mr. Cohen, until it became clear he might speak against the president. A White House spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Asked over text message about the significance of the lunch, Mr. Giuliani directed a reporter to Mr. Trump\u2019s show of support on Twitter. He said his relationship with Mr. Trump was \u201cthe same as ever,\u201d but declined to answer additional questions, explaining he was watching the New York Yankees\u2019 playoff baseball game against the Houston Astros. The two people familiar with the discussions between Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani said they believed it would be difficult to prove that Mr. Giuliani violated FARA. The law requires American citizens to disclose to the Justice Department any contacts with the government or media in the United States at the direction or request of foreign politicians or government officials, regardless of whether they paid for the representation. Mr. Giuliani has acknowledged that he and two of his associates, who were arrested on campaign finance charges on Wednesday, worked with Ukrainian prosecutors to collect potentially damaging information about targets of Mr. Trump and his allies, including a former American ambassador to Ukraine and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his younger son, Hunter Biden. Mr. Giuliani shared that material this year with American government officials and a Trump-friendly columnist in an effort to undermine the ambassador and other Trump targets. But Mr. Giuliani said that he had undertaken that work on behalf of Mr. Trump, not the Ukrainian prosecutors. He said he had in fact turned down an offer to represent one of the prosecutors because it would have posed a conflict with his work for the president. What concerns some of Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers more than a possible FARA prosecution related to his Ukraine work is that Mr. Giuliani, who has been representing the president pro bono, is facing a contentious and potentially costly divorce from his third wife, Judith Nathan, and that he may have taken on clients overseas who could be problematic for him with prosecutors. While Mr. Trump has been reluctant to separate from Mr. Giuliani, some of his advisers hope he will. They remain concerned about Mr. Giuliani\u2019s public commentary about the president and the Ukraine issue.",

Such a one sided Witch Hunt going on in USA. Deep State. Shameful!\u201d On Friday, Mr. Trump was far less emphatic when asked if Mr. Giuliani was still his personal lawyer. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Mr. Trump said as he left the White House for a campaign rally in Louisiana. \u201cI haven\u2019t spoken to Rudy. I spoke to him yesterday briefly. He\u2019s a very good attorney and he has been my attorney.\u201d The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Saturday about Mr. Giuliani\u2019s status. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan are scrutinizing whether Mr. Giuliani violated federal lobbying laws with his dealings in Ukraine, especially his role in undermining Marie L. Yovanovitch, the ousted American ambassador to Ukraine, a former Soviet republic, The New York Times reported on Friday. Mr. Giuliani has denied wrongdoing, but acknowledged participating in an effort to dig up dirt on Mr. Trump\u2019s political adversaries, particularly former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. That effort is the focus of a parallel impeachment probe in the House of Representatives. Mr. Trump\u2019s full-throated defense of Mr. Giuliani came less than 72 hours after two of Mr. Giuliani\u2019s associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, were arrested on Wednesday night with one-way tickets to Frankfurt at Dulles International Airport outside of Washington. The two men were charged with making illegal campaign donations, said Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, a position once held by Mr. Giuliani. While the indictments did not accuse Mr. Trump of wrongdoing, Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman helped Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to gather damaging information in Ukraine on his political opponents, particularly former Mr. Biden and his son Hunter Biden.",

      "author": "Astead W. Herndon",
      "content": " ANKENY, Iowa \u2014 When Donald Trump was elected, John Olsen felt enraged by the racial tension that fueled his rise, the silence of his white neighbors and the stories of racial discrimination he heard from his nonwhite friends. Black friends said they were followed around department stores, so Mr. Olsen, who is white, became a member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. He thought that white Americans were scared of the country\u2019s growing Latino population, so he joined the League of United Latin American Citizens. He now registers voters weekly, including with the League of Women Voters, to atone for his \u201cwhite privilege,\u201d he said. \u201cI try to have my bases covered,\u201d said Mr. Olsen, 50, who wore a N.A.A.C.P. T-shirt to a campaign rally for Senator Kamala Harris here last week. \u201cIt just hurts my heart that white people are afraid of the country\u2019s growing Hispanic population. And I just can\u2019t allow that to continue.\u201d White liberals \u2014 voters like Mr. Olsen \u2014 are thinking more explicitly about race than they did even a decade ago, according to new research and polling. In one survey, an overwhelming majority said that racial discrimination affects the lives of black people. They embrace terms like \u201cstructural racism\u201d and \u201cwhite privilege.\u201d The shift in white liberal attitudes on race might be a permanent one, helped along by a changing media environment and heightened cultural sensitivity, or it could be a more fleeting reaction to the current polarized moment. Either way, it means that in the Democratic primary, candidates have an incentive to talk to white voters explicitly about race \u2014 an incentive that is especially apparent now that a half-dozen Democrats are intensifying their campaigning in the key early states of Iowa and New Hampshire. In Iowa last week, Ms. Harris delivered a revamped stump speech that seemed tailored to these changing attitudes. At an outdoor market in Ankeny, just outside Des Moines, she spoke to the fears some white voters might have about supporting a woman of color. In her pitch, she cast herself as an embodiment of racial progress. \u201cPeople are asking, \u2018Oh, I don\u2019t know, is America ready for that? Are they ready for a woman of color to be elected president of the United States?\u2019\u201d Ms. Harris told the crowd. \u201cLook, it\u2019s not a new conversation for me. In fact, it\u2019s a conversation that\u2019s come up every single time in every election that I have \u2014 and here\u2019s the operative word \u2014 won,\u201d she said. Her largely white audience liked the pitch, responding with rapt silence and then with raucous applause when she talked candidly about her own accomplishments. For years, prospective Democratic nominees came to Iowa to talk ethanol and pork subsidies and saved any rhetoric about the injustice of racial profiling for crowds in South Carolina and Nevada \u2014 the only early voting states where black and Latino voters made up a significant portion of the Democratic electorate. But in the era of Mr. Trump, and after social movements such as Black Lives Matter pushed racial inequality to the forefront of national politics, it\u2019s white Democrats in Iowa and New Hampshire \u2014 not black ones in South Carolina \u2014 who, to this point, are embracing the candidates who promise to upend society in the name of racial equity. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has held a commanding lead in national polls with nonwhite Democrats, but surveys show that white liberals in Iowa and New Hampshire are less inclined to support him. At events for Mr. Biden, some white voters cite his confounding September debate answer on the legacy of slavery and previous Senate work with segregationists as reasons to support other candidates. At events for Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind. \u2014 two white candidates who have particularly excelled with college-educated liberals \u2014 supporters pointed to policies addressing racial inequalities as part of the candidates\u2019 appeal. These policies may give cover to those seeking to support a white candidate in a historically diverse Democratic field, which includes Ms. Harris, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, and former cabinet secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro \u2014 candidates who are themselves racial minorities and who are struggling to gain traction in the polls. \u201cMy daughter is marrying an Asian man and diversity has become very important to me,\u201d said Julie Neff, a 57-year-old Iowa Democrat who attended the Harris rally. Ms. Neff, who is white, said she was embarrassed that she started thinking about race and discrimination only later in life. \u201cI should\u2019ve been paying attention to this stuff sooner. But when Trump is making these decisions, I just realized it would be bad for my son-in-law and my grandchildren,\u201d she said. According to research by Zach Goldberg, a Georgia State University doctoral student, the attitudes of white liberals like Ms. Neff have moved dramatically in a short time. In 2010, about 40 percent of white liberals said \u201cblacks who can\u2019t get ahead in this country are mostly responsible for their own condition.\u201d Now, that number has dropped to 24 percent, and more than 70 percent of white liberals say \u201cracial discrimination is the main reason why many black people can\u2019t get ahead these days.\u201d Mr. Goldberg said he believed that Mr. Trump\u2019s election combined with a digital media environment where race has been covered more explicitly have pushed white liberals into adopting new positions. \u201cBefore, if a black person was shot by police you could read about it in a newspaper, now you see a video,\u201d Mr. Goldberg said. \u201cA video is morally evocative and that has effect on the moral psychology of liberals.\" The result, Mr. Goldberg said, is that white liberals want \u201cto be the exact opposite of racist. They go adopt positions to prove they\u2019re different than the morally tainted collective.\u201d But this is not a strategy without risk, Mr. Goldberg noted. Voters in a general election, including Republicans and independents, do not share the liberal views about race that white Democrats do. Positions that some leading Democrats have embraced, including reparations for black Americans, could become liabilities. \u201cWhen you think about it, this is why blacks may be supporting Biden the way they do,\u201d Mr. Goldberg said. \u201cThey know this may not sell to the rest of white America come general election time.\u201d In the early days of Ms. Warren\u2019s candidacy, the differences among Democratic primary voters were most clear when she discussed low black homeownership rates \u2014 a standard portion of her policy-heavy stump speech. Black audiences in Mississippi and Alabama often seemed unmoved, already well aware of the problem Ms. Warren outlined. In Iowa, predominantly white groups reacted dramatically \u2014 often with oohs and ahhs and the occasional applause. At events for Ms. Harris last week, several white voters said that the president\u2019s reliance on white identity politics to motivate his conservative base had forced them to reorganize their own voting priorities. Ms. Neff\u2019s husband, Bill, wore a Black Lives Matter T-shirt to the evening rally. \u201cWe had Obama and we thought this racial stuff was over \u2014 and then we went backward,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen so many old white guys who are O.K. with the status quo, and that\u2019s not O.K. anymore.\u201d People like the Neffs and Mr. Olsen could have an outsize effect on the 2020 primary, and the Democratic Party going forward. The largely white voters in the earliest nominating contests in Iowa and New Hampshire determine which candidates appear viable by the time people in more diverse states head to the voting booth. Barack Obama famously exploited this playbook in 2008, winning white liberals in Iowa before unlocking his support among black voters. This year\u2019s most prominent black candidates \u2014 Mr. Booker and Ms. Harris \u2014 are both seeking to repeat that strategy, and have staked their candidacies on a good showing with those same white liberals in the first-in-the-nation caucus. But the candidate most affected by the attitude shift among white liberals may be Mr. Biden. He has crafted his campaign pitch around replacing Mr. Trump with a steady hand, and in his campaign announcement video featured the president\u2019s waffling response to the racist and anti-Semitic marchers in Charlottesville, Va. [Get to know the Politics reporters covering the 2020 election for The Times.] Mr. Biden enjoys a significant advantage among black voters, fueled by their pragmatic desire to see Mr. Trump replaced and good feelings carried over from his time as Mr. Obama\u2019s vice president. For white liberal voters, though, the affection for Mr. Biden is not as firm. Martha Wasmund, 64, said at the Harris event in Ankeny that she preferred the California senator, and was rejecting Mr. Biden\u2019s candidacy because of the fond way he recalled working with segregationist lawmakers. Ms. Wasmund is white. \u201cThat good ol\u2019 boy network doesn\u2019t work,\u201d she said, referring to Mr. Biden\u2019s legislative work with avowed racists in the 1970s and 1980s. Janelle Turner, 50, brought her 12-year-old daughter to Ms. Harris\u2019s rally. She is white and said she\u2019s seen a change in Democrats in her majority-white community. \u201cPeople have realized that this stuff is important and that Trump has made racial division greater,\u201d Ms. Turner said. \u201cI\u2019m a breast cancer survivor and health care is a huge issue for me, but this stuff is too.\u201d Some black voters see privilege in such responses. Dacia Randolph, a 43-year-old in Reno, Nev., said black voters are sticking with Mr. Biden not because they are unaware of his past, but because they see defeating Mr. Trump as an urgent priority. She called Mr. Biden a \u201csafe bet,\u201d pointing to polls that show him ahead of Mr. Trump in the general election and the surprising results of the 2016 election. \u201cBlack people go with who we trust,\u201d Ms. Randolph said. \u201cWe make people prove themselves.\u201d",

      "author": "Lisa Lerer",
      "content": " Sign up here to get On Politics in your inbox. It\u2019s the one question about impeachment that no Democratic presidential candidate wants to answer head on. Should Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter have been allowed to sit on the board of a foreign company while his father served as vice president? In the past few weeks, Mr. Biden and his campaign team have spent significant amounts of time and energy denouncing any whiff of impropriety between his son\u2019s work and his service as vice president. They\u2019re right: There is no evidence that Hunter Biden made millions of dollars from his overseas work or that his father intervened inappropriately with Ukraine or China on his behalf, as President Trump has falsely claimed. But in politics, appearances matter. Just ask Hillary Clinton or Mr. Trump, or for that matter, anyone who has ever run for office. At a moment when a populist, anti-establishment fervor runs through both parties, the image of Hunter Biden doing business in Ukraine and China while his father played a prominent role in American foreign policy could quickly become a political liability \u2014 a fact that clearly concerns Mr. Biden and his team, given their fierce efforts to denounce the story. So far, none of the Democratic primary candidates have taken a hard swing at Mr. Biden, focusing instead on the impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump. But a few are, quite delicately, trying to raise some concerns. Former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke suggested, albeit mildly, that Hunter Biden\u2019s work posed a problem, telling reporters, \u201cI would not allow a family member, anyone in my cabinet to have a family member, to work in a position like that.\u201d Senator Cory Booker called Mr. Biden \u201ctruly an honorable man\u201d on CNN last week, adding, \u201cThis is in no way can besmirch his character, his honor and his incredible service to this country over decades.\u201d But, he noted, \u201cI just do not think that children of presidents, of vice presidents during an administration should be out there doing that.\u201d Senator Amy Klobuchar took a similar position when asked whether she\u2019d be comfortable with the child of her vice president sitting on the board of a foreign company. \u201cI can promise you right now, my own daughter, who\u2019s only 24, does not sit on the board of a foreign company,\u201d she said, also on CNN. \u201cBut that is not the issue. The issue here is what the president is doing.\u201d Much of the rest of field has largely dodged the question. Senator Elizabeth Warren initially said she didn\u2019t know when asked whether her ethics plan would prevent a top official\u2019s child from getting a job with a foreign company. Since then, she\u2019s pivoted back to Mr. Trump when asked similar questions. And Senator Kamala Harris, when asked about the issue, has taken to simply saying: \u201cLeave Joe Biden alone.\u201d In past debates, candidates who have taken on Mr. Biden\u2019s personal characteristics, like his age, have faced blowback. The questions surrounding his son may be even more sensitive: Democratic voters generally feel warmly toward \u201cUncle Joe,\u201d particularly when it comes to his family, which has been deeply marked by the tragic deaths of his first wife and infant daughter and his elder son, Beau. Echoing an attack introduced and continually leveraged \u2014 in false ways \u2014 by Mr. Trump could risk raising Democrats\u2019 ire. That doesn\u2019t mean the question won\u2019t be asked at the CNN/New York Times debate on Tuesday night. I don\u2019t know what the questions will be, but my bet is on the topic coming up (Marc Lacey, if you\u2019re listening\u2026). Whether a candidate takes the gamble will be interesting to watch. So, yes, The Times and CNN are co-hosting the next Democratic debate in Ohio on Tuesday. As we near the main event, you can register now for either of these phone conversations between Times reporters and editors: Monday, Oct. 14, from 2 to 2:45 p.m. Eastern time: Deputy politics editor Rachel Dry moderates a conversation between national politics reporters Astead W.

My colleague Jennifer Medina wrote this week about Juli\u00e1n Castro, his activist mother and the political power of third-generation immigrants. She dug into the demographics for us. Who is an American? It\u2019s a question that\u2019s just beneath the surface of many debates over race and immigration. In dozens of conversations with Latinos whose families have lived in the United States for generations, there was one sentiment they nearly all shared: They suddenly felt their own Americanness was being called into question. The idea of a perpetual foreignness is hardly new. Mexican-Americans have been fighting that perception for generations, as Rosie Castro, the Chicana activist and mother of Juli\u00e1n Castro, the only Latino running for president, recently told me. Just how many Latinos come from families who have lived in the United States for at least three generations? Demographers at the Pew Research Center put the figure at 17 million, roughly 30 percent of the Latino population over all. That percentage has remained steady over the last several years, while the percentage of foreign-born Latinos dropped to below 50 percent in 2013, and is now at 48 percent. For years, many political leaders like Mr. Castro saw the power of Latinos increasing, but the Trump era has made clear how elusive that power might be. So, now, they are directly discussing race and embracing the kind of rhetoric they once shied away from \u2014 the kind their second-generation parents used in the 1960s.

      "author": "Maggie Astor",
      "content": "  Here\u2019s our rundown of what happened in the Democratic primary this week, as the candidates gear up for Tuesday\u2019s debate in Ohio. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. explicitly endorsed impeachment on Wednesday, going beyond past statements in which he had called only for an impeachment inquiry if President Trump did not cooperate with Congress. \u201cTo preserve our Constitution, our democracy, our basic integrity, he should be impeached,\u201d Mr. Biden told supporters in New Hampshire, as he accused Mr. Trump of having \u201cbetrayed this nation.\u201d It\u2019s been a whirlwind week for Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who is recovering from a heart attack. In addition to the concerns the episode raised about his health, his campaign\u2019s delay in disclosing the heart attack led to criticism about its transparency, which Mr. Sanders has forcefully rejected. Perhaps more consequentially, Mr. Sanders told reporters on Tuesday that he would be changing the \u201cnature\u201d of his campaign by doing fewer events. On Wednesday, he said he had misspoken. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts often tells voters that after she became \u201cvisibly pregnant\u201d at the end of her first year as a public-school teacher, the principal wished her luck and hired someone else to replace her. This week, a conservative news site and other outlets challenged her account, citing a 2007 interview with Ms. Warren and minutes from a school board meeting \u2014 and Ms. Warren pushed back in a unique way. Rather than just restating the truth of her account (though she has done that as well), she called on women to share their own stories of pregnancy discrimination, which remains widespread. CNN and the Human Rights Campaign hosted the latest subject-based forum of the presidential race on Thursday, focused on gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender issues. Protesters interrupted the event at several points to call attention to the murders of black transgender women, and the candidates seemed to welcome the reminder. Before the event, Ms. Warren, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and Senator Kamala Harris of California released plans on L.G.B.T.Q. equality. All three said they would fight to pass the Equality Act and ban conversion therapy as president. This week brought a deluge of new policy proposals on issues ranging from foster care to judicial ethics. The fifth presidential debate will be held in Georgia on Wednesday, Nov. 20, and the hosts will be MSNBC and The Washington Post. As previously announced, candidates will need 165,000 donors and at least 3 percent support in four qualifying polls to make the stage. (An alternative polling option is 5 percent support in two early-state polls.) Eight candidates have met those criteria so far; the latest was Andrew Yang, who did so this past week. Ms. Warren had a crowd-pleasing comeback at the CNN town hall when asked how she would respond to a supporter who said, \u201cSenator, I\u2019m old-fashioned, and my faith teaches me that marriage is between one man and one woman.\u201d Read more about the moment here.",

Tonight, I\u2019m writing to you from Columbus, Ohio, where The New York Times has descended in force for the biggest presidential primary debate in history. This one is particularly exciting for those of us at the paper, since The Times is co-hosting the debate with CNN and our own Marc Lacey will be one of the moderators. More on that in a minute. Tonight is also an exciting milestone for this little newsletter. Starting this week, we\u2019ll be appearing in your inbox five evenings a week. We have tons of exciting things ahead \u2014 impeachment and primaries and a general election, oh my! Sign up, forward us to your friends and get them to sign up, and as always, thanks for reading. Now, back to the debate. Tuesday night\u2019s event comes at a truly extraordinary moment in American politics. In Washington, the impeachment inquiry into President Trump is moving forward at a dizzying pace. Senator Bernie Sanders is out of the hospital, former Vice President Joe Biden is out of patience and Senator Elizabeth Warren seems out to get Facebook. With a dozen candidates stuffed onstage, there are bound to be some fireworks. Here\u2019s some of what we\u2019ll be watching: On Sunday, Mr. Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden said he would step down from his board position at a Chinese investment firm. On Monday, Mr. Biden released a government ethics plan. On Tuesday, Hunter Biden will do a major television interview. Seems as if Mr. Biden and his team want to make sure he has plenty to talk about Tuesday night when it comes to his family, ethics and Mr. Trump. The challenge for Mr. Biden will be whether he can leverage the fact that Mr. Trump now faces impeachment proceedings because of the president\u2019s efforts to collect opposition research on him and his son, without getting stuck in a morass of questions about his own family. After being hospitalized for a heart attack, Mr. Sanders, 78, needs to convince voters that he is not too old to be president. The debate signifies his return to the race: He has remained off the campaign trail since Oct. 1, when he had two stents inserted to clear a blocked artery after experiencing chest pains at a campaign event. Aides to Mr. Sanders rebuffed questions asked by my colleague Sydney Ember about whether he\u2019d be able to stand so long on a stage, but they fully realize that his energy, vibrancy and ability will be under intense scrutiny from voters. Ms. Warren\u2019s surge in the polls has finally reached the point where it has become problematic for Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders. Both men have signaled that attacks could be coming, with Mr. Sanders drawing a pretty sharp contrast over the weekend. It\u2019s likely that some of those attacks will focus on her health care plan: how she would pay for it, whether she would raise taxes on the middle class, whether she would end private insurance plans and how she would accommodate union health plans. Will Ms. Warren be ready with more polished answers than she has given in the past? Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., has the most field offices in the early states (tied with Ms. Warren) and a generous campaign bank account (only Mr. Sanders has raised more among Democrats). What he lacks is actual traction in the polls. So far, most of his debate performances have been characterized by \u201cWest Wing\u201d-style monologues. But there are signs he may pivot to a more aggressive tack Tuesday night in hopes of expanding his support. In recent weeks, he has nudged Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders on health care and has been in something of a sniper fight with former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas. There have been plenty of signs that the two young guns in the race may be headed for a shootout at the Otterbein University Corral. The question is whether that will be enough for either to make a mark. Four candidates on the stage haven\u2019t qualified for the next debate in November: the former housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Mr. O\u2019Rourke. Tuesday night is a now-or-never moment for them. Expect some fireworks \u2014 or at least an attempt to light a fuse. For Mr. Steyer, it\u2019s his first time in a primary debate. He\u2019s an actual billionaire standing onstage at a time when several candidates have built populist campaigns running against the billionaires. But he\u2019s also one of the most progressive candidates in the field on issues like climate change and impeachment. As for Ms. Gabbard, her campaign has emerged as one of the biggest mysteries of the 2020 race. After threatening last week to boycott the debate, she is now planning to appear. She could attack the entire political class, the Democratic Party and the media. Or not! No one quite knows what to expect from either one of these iconoclastic competitors. Here\u2019s our list of who has qualified for the stage. Check out our visual guide to the debate.

Our National editor, Marc Lacey, has held a lot of the biggest jobs at The New York Times: White House correspondent, a foreign correspondent who has reported from dozens of countries and the editor of the weekend news report. Now, he is about to take on perhaps his highest-profile task yet \u2014 moderating the Democratic primary debate. We had some questions about that. Marc was kind enough to give us some answers. But, sadly, not the questions. So, a dozen candidates on the stage, a nonstop flood of Big Breaking News out of Washington. How do you prepare for this kind of debate, in this particularly extraordinary moment in American politics? There are a lot of candidates, no doubt about it. And so many critical issues to ask about. This debate could go on until the sun comes up. But we\u2019ve had to cull the many things we could ask into one meaty debate in one evening. How important is it to ask about what\u2019s happening with the administration versus what\u2019s happening in Democratic policy circles? Put another way, what\u2019s the balancing act between asking about President Trump and, say, health care policy? I can\u2019t get into the questions. I\u2019ve been sworn to secrecy. You\u2019re a print guy about to enter a TV world. Is that nerve-racking? I\u2019ve been in the hotel gym a couple of times a day to remain calm. I can already do more pull-ups than James Comey has set as his goal. How much do you take into account what happened at past debates when making your plan of attack for this one? I\u2019ve watched every previous debate and every candidates\u2019 forum from this election season. That\u2019s hours and hours of preparation. I know you can\u2019t tell us the questions. But, seriously, can you tell us the questions? Any hints, at least? There will be questions, many questions, and they will be substantive questions. Does that answer your question? Any pre-debate rituals? This is my very first debate, so I have no ritual. I\u2019m open to suggestions. And I\u2019m not certain yet how I will nourish myself immediately beforehand. There\u2019s this great taco joint a couple of blocks from my hotel, though. Uh, don\u2019t think we\u2019re talking about quite the same Saints. Were you forwarded this newsletter?

Biden\u2019s son also said he would not work for foreign-owned companies if his father became president.By Katie GlueckPRINT EDITIONBiden\u2019s Son to Leave Chinese Company, Pre-empting Conflict of Interest|October 14, 2019, Page A18",
      "author": "Katie Glueck",
      "content": " ALTOONA, Iowa \u2014 Hunter Biden, whose overseas business dealings have drawn relentless attacks from President Trump and posed a threat to the candidacy of his father, Joseph R. Biden Jr., intends to step down from the board of a Chinese company, BHR, by the end of the month, his lawyer said on Sunday, a move his father later lauded in a forceful defense of his son\u2019s integrity. The lawyer also said in a statement that if Mr. Biden were to be elected president, his son would \u201cagree not to serve on boards of, or work on behalf of, foreign-owned companies.\u201d The decision is the first action the pro-Biden camp has taken that appears to acknowledge the extent to which Hunter Biden\u2019s business practices have created an untenable problem for his father\u2019s 2020 campaign. With the fourth Democratic primary debate only two days away, political strategists said Hunter Biden\u2019s decision to leave the Chinese company could help defuse the issue at a time when Mr. Biden\u2019s lower-polling Democratic rivals have suggested his son\u2019s work overseas raises questions about conflict of interest.  \u201cHunter\u2019s decision won\u2019t stop Trump from spreading debunked conspiracy theories about the past,\u201d said David Axelrod, President Barack Obama\u2019s former chief strategist. \u201cBut it does give Joe Biden an answer he didn\u2019t have about potential conflicts of interest moving forward.\u201d In a brief news conference here Sunday in which he repeatedly pounded the podium, Mr. Biden stressed that the decision to leave the Chinese company\u2019s board had been his son\u2019s alone and suggested he learned of the statement from Hunter Biden\u2019s lawyers. He also took what seemed to be veiled swipes at some of Mr. Trump\u2019s children, who have had their own overseas business dealings. \u201cThe statement my son put out today, which I saw when he put it out \u2014 I was told it was going to be put out, I did not consult with him about what\u2019s being put out \u2014 in fact represents the kind of man of integrity he is,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cAnd I can tell you now, if I am your president, next president, I\u2019m going to build on the squeaky-clean transparent environment that we had in the Obama-Biden White House, and no one in my family or associated with me will be involved in any foreign operation whatsoever. Period, end of story.\u201d Minutes later, he appeared to jab more sharply at members of the Trump family, a message that Mr. Biden, a Senate traditionalist who reveres beltway customs and civility, does not typically emphasize. \u201cNo one in my family will have an office in the White House, will sit in on meetings as if they\u2019re a Cabinet member, will in fact have any business relationship with anyone that relates to a foreign corporation or a foreign country,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one,\u201d he said twice, smacking the podium each time, \u201chas asserted my son did a single thing wrong.\u201d \u201cNo one,\u201d he said, \u201chas asserted that I have done anything wrong except the lying president. That\u2019s the only thing. That\u2019s the focus.\" There is no evidence Mr. Biden acted improperly to aid his son\u2019s overseas financial dealings in China and Ukraine, as Mr. Trump has asserted. Still, many on the Biden team are gravely concerned about the president\u2019s ability to inflict damage with a barrage of claims that, while baseless, could nevertheless take hold in voters\u2019 views of the race. Some of those claims have been featured  in an expansive pro-Trump advertising campaign. Mr. Biden has consistently ranked as one of the Democratic Party\u2019s leading presidential candidates. But his advantage has slipped in some recent polls, and his fund-raising has lagged his top rivals. Over the last two weeks he has begun to vigorously fight back against Mr. Trump\u2019s criticisms; last week, in a fiery address in New Hampshire, he called for the first time for Mr. Trump to be impeached, a view he expanded on when addressing a gathering of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union Sunday afternoon. \u201cIt does have an incredibly negative impact on the state of affairs in the country,\u201d he said. \u201cI wish it didn\u2019t get there, but it\u2019s gotten so far now, if you don\u2019t, if you don\u2019t move on it, then what do we say to the rest of the world about who we are? What do you say about opening the gates and saying, \u2018come on in, get involved in our elections?\u2019\u201d The statement on Sunday from Hunter Biden\u2019s lawyer, George Mesires, said his client had served only as a member of board of directors of BHR,  an equity investment fund manager, \u201cwhich he joined based on his interest in seeking ways to bring Chinese capital to international markets.\u201d It was an unpaid position. Mr. Mesires has previously said Hunter Biden became an investor in 2017, taking a 10 percent stake in BHR. The statement had been in the works for weeks, one Biden adviser said. Over the past month, Mr. Biden and his team have at times hesitated about how to respond to Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks, and some Democratic operatives and voters have wondered why Mr. Biden and his campaign did not respond more swiftly and comprehensively. His campaign didn\u2019t answer several follow-up questions about the younger Mr. Biden\u2019s decision, including about why Hunter Biden didn\u2019t recuse himself earlier. Mr. Trump has directed his broadsides against Hunter Biden as he faces an impeachment inquiry in the House, which was spurred by the president\u2019s entreaties to the government of Ukraine urging the government to investigate Hunter Biden\u2019s financial dealings there. Subsequently, Mr. Trump publicly called for China to look into Hunter Biden\u2019s financial dealings in that country. Mr. Trump has said with no evidence that the younger Mr. Biden used political ties to induce China to invest $1.5  billion in a fund he was involved in, an assertion Joseph Biden has denied. Aides say Mr. Biden has been bracing for weeks for questions about his son onstage at Tuesday\u2019s CNN/New York Times debate. His allies and advisers say that any Democrat who broaches the subject is playing into Mr. Trump\u2019s hands and hurting the party\u2019s cause, and some have suggested Mr. Biden is prepared to make that case if he faces skepticism over his son\u2019s Ukraine dealings from either the moderators or rival Democrats. Mr. Biden, said Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, a close Biden ally,  is \u201cnot going to be surprised\u201d by any attacks on the debate stage on Tuesday, even highly personal ones. Still, some Democrats say the national focus on Mr. Biden\u2019s family has become a political vulnerability, moving him off his campaign message and forcing him to play defense. \u201cIt becomes a distraction, and that\u2019s what hurt Hillary Clinton in 2016,\u201d said Bret Nilles, the Democratic Party chairman in Linn County, Iowa, alluding to the scrutiny of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s email practices while she was secretary of state. The Biden campaign\u2019s approach has been to push back firmly on Mr. Trump\u2019s claims through an aggressive media strategy, and to argue that the president is attacking Mr. Biden because he is concerned about running against him in a general election. \u201cThey can also say, for Democrats who are nervous about it, \u2018Hunter\u2019s taken a step to say he won\u2019t be on these boards if the vice president is elected president,\u2019 and they could say, \u2018we\u2019ve addressed it and it\u2019s time to move on,\u2019\u201d said Jennifer Palmieri, who was Mrs. Clinton\u2019s communications director in the 2016 presidential campaign. \u201cThere are these campaign rituals you have to go through when your campaign does hit a perilous patch like this in order to signal to the press you\u2019re handling it right, and to reassure supporters.\u201d Mr. Biden sought to take that tack with reporters Sunday, repeatedly seeking to direct attention back to Mr. Trump\u2019s behavior. Mr. Biden also began his remarks at the union gathering by praising Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., for a morning television appearance where he defended \u201cme and my family against these outrageous, lying ads\u201d from Mr. Trump. The last few weeks have been a challenging time for Mr. Biden, aides and allies have said. The Biden family, which is close-knit, has endured painful losses over the years, including the death in 2015 of Mr. Biden\u2019s elder son Beau Biden;  Hunter Biden is the former vice president\u2019s only surviving son. In the weeks since news broke that Mr. Trump urged the Ukrainians to look into Mr. Biden\u2019s family, he has held only a handful of public events, spending significant time at fund-raisers as the third quarter of the year drew to a close.  He finished the quarter having raised about $10 million less than his two top rivals, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. Mr. Biden has also toggled between responding sharply to Mr. Trump and pivoting back to policy, though he has ramped up his criticisms of Mr. Trump forcefully in recent weeks, and is expected to make the president a major focus of his debate appearance on Tuesday, a Biden adviser said.

But many of them, too, want to withdraw from the Middle East.By David E. SangerPRINT EDITIONTrump\u2019s Foreign Policy Draws Wide Criticism And Differing Ideas|October 16, 2019, Page A16",
      "author": "David E. Sanger",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 For nearly two decades, Republicans have dominated national security debates, portraying themselves as tough on terrorists after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and tough on a recalcitrant, disruptive Russia. On Tuesday night, Democrats sensed an opportunity to retake that ground, attacking President Trump\u2019s impulsive action in Syria as a gift to the Islamic State and to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. But it was not an easy path. Debating American foreign policy among themselves in a sustained way for the first time in the campaign, the 12 candidates on the debate stage in Ohio found themselves caught between their party\u2019s intensifying instinct to extract the United States from war and their desire to cast Mr. Trump\u2019s rapid retreat from Syria as dangerous and incompetent. In heated exchanges, the candidates were largely unified in their critique of Mr. Trump\u2019s willingness to abandon the Kurds in northern Syria; \u201cbetrayal\u201d was the most commonly used word. They drew a clear distinction between the president\u2019s impulsiveness and their own promises to maintain alliances and bring American forces home in a deliberate, orderly way. At moments, they sounded like Mr. Trump\u2019s many Republican critics in Congress, who have been equally critical of his handling of the crisis in Syria. Yet the Democrats struggled to articulate what strategy they would pursue if they inherited the carnage and disarray stemming from Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to give Turkey\u2019s leader, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, what amounted to a green light to invade his neighbor. Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to pull American troops without a backup plan put the dozen Democrats in an unusual position: It ceded to them strong-on-counterterrorism ground once largely dominated by Republicans. One by one the Democrats warned that Mr. Trump was allowing thousands of Islamic State terrorists, now breaking free from camps where they were contained by Kurdish forces in Syria, to again pose an imminent threat to the region, and ultimately to the United States. They were clearly suggesting that if a terrorist strike emanated from the region, they would blame Mr. Trump\u2019s failure to anticipate the consequences of his actions. \u201cHe has helped ISIS get another foothold, a new lease on life,\u201d Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said during what amounted to the first extensive discussion of national security in the Democratic debates so far. \u201cWe have ISIS that is going to come here,\" said her chief rival in the polls, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. But both candidates exhibited the complex straddle that Democrats are performing these days, as they try to sound tougher and more competent than Mr. Trump while also playing to their party\u2019s aversion to keeping American troops indefinitely in war zones. \u201cI think that we ought to get out of the Middle East,\u201d Ms. Warren said. She then dwelled on a description of how she would pull back differently, and more skillfully, than Mr. Trump\u2019s rapid and chaotic retreat in the past week. Mr. Biden, the only one of the candidates with a long record in foreign issues, declined \u2014 twice \u2014 to answer a question about whether he would reinsert the American troops that have been withdrawn from northern Syria. Instead, he talked about protecting the forces still in the country, saying he would give them air cover and \u201cmake it clear they\u2019re not going anywhere.\u201d He then turned to Mr. Trump\u2019s abandonment of the Kurds, America\u2019s longtime ally in fighting ISIS, shouting: \u201cThis is shameful! Shameful what this man has done.\u201d Only Mayor Pete Buttigieg of Indiana, who served in Afghanistan, made the distinction between ending large combat operations and keeping \u201ca small number of specialized, special operations forces and intelligence capabilities\u201d on the ground, especially in Syria. Those forces, he argued, \u201cwere the only thing that stood between that part of Syria\u201d and \u201cthe beginning of a genocide and the resurgence of ISIS.\u201d It is a distinction Mr. Trump, and many of those seeking to run against him on the Democratic ticket, have passed by. The exchanges on Syria, followed by a parallel discussion of how to contain Russia\u2019s increasing aggressiveness, underscored one of the oddities of the 2020 election season: Faced with a Republican president who has envisioned a far more isolationist approach to American power, the Democrats are sounding like interventionist Republicans of just a few years ago. When Mitt Romney ran against President Barack Obama in 2012, he called Russia the \u201cNo. 1 geopolitical foe\u201d facing the United States and argued that containing Mr. Putin would be his top priority. That led Mr. Obama, with a laugh, to respond: \u201cThe 1980s, they\u2019re now calling to ask for their foreign policy back,\u201d an effort to paint Mr. Romney as a cold warrior who did not realize that era had passed. Now, that Russia-focused policy is back for those hoping to reassemble Mr. Obama\u2019s coalition. In sharp contrast to Mr. Trump, who has never been openly critical of Mr. Putin, several said they would expose the Russian leader\u2019s links to corruption and freeze his bank accounts. (That was a measure briefly considered \u2014 and rejected \u2014 by Mr. Obama in late 2016, as he tried to figure out how to punish Mr. Putin as the interference in the presidential election that year became clear.) The candidates tried to outdo one another in explaining how tough they would be on Moscow. \u201cWe have not talked about what we need to do to protect ourselves from Russia invading our election,\u201d said Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. She called for the entire nation to use backup paper ballots, a step that Tom Steyer, the billionaire hedge-fund manager who gained a name \u2014 and a place on the debate stage on Tuesday night \u2014 with an expensive campaign to press for Mr. Trump\u2019s impeachment, said he \u201cabsolutely\u201d would freeze Mr. Putin\u2019s assets. But it was Syria that gave Mr. Steyer, and most of the other candidates, the opportunity they sought to present Mr. Trump as an erratic, unthinking commander in chief, incapable at looking around corners or considering the second-order effects of his actions. \u201cMr. Trump\u2019s having no plans, having no process and having no partners has proved to be a disaster in Syria,\u201d he argued. He called the president\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d approach, a slogan he adopted during the 2016 campaign, \u201c the worst idea I have ever heard and I would change it on day one.\u201d But at the same time, the candidates repeatedly struggled to explain how they would handle a problem like Mr. Erdogan, an ostensible ally who has in the past few months bought Russian air defenses and sent troops to seize territory in a neighboring state. \u201cTurkey is not a U.S. ally,\" said Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, \u201cwhen they invade another country and engage in mass slaughter.\u201d But he quickly turned the issue back to Mr. Trump, blaming him, not Mr. Erdogan, for the current crisis. \u201cYou tell me what country in the world will trust the word of the president of the United States,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. Mr. Biden came the closest to describing how he would approach the situation today, suggesting he would threaten to expel Turkey from North Atlantic Treaty Organization \u2014 a step that would be difficult to impossible under the alliance\u2019s charter \u2014 and lay out a series of steps that would force Mr. Erdogan to reverse course. But his prescription of tough talk to force a dubious ally into line sounded much like what Mr. Trump is belatedly seeking to do by sending Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the new national security adviser, Robert C. O\u2019Brien, to Turkey this week.",

      "author": "Reid J. Epstein",
      "content": "  As part of our 2020 debate coverage, we are asking political debate coaches and experts to tell us what each candidate needs to do to win, and what advice they would give those onstage. Then we will ask the experts afterward how the candidates did. KELLY The former vice president should aggressively set the record straight armed with facts and outside validators, and make clear that Trump\u2019s motivation is simple: He\u2019s scared of running against Biden and is trying to pick a different nominee. Biden should then quickly pivot back to what voters love and believe about him: that he\u2019s fighting for working families and has a record of delivering on issues like health care, while Donald Trump has failed these very same workers and families. A kitchen table contrast with Biden is deadly for Trump. O\u2019DONNELL Biden needs to answer the question of how his son got the position in Ukraine carefully, but stay on offense if he is to escape having this rub off on him more than it has. If the press drills down, and he appears weak, then others might pile on or use it to frame Biden as part of the past they\u2019re attempting to move on from. His hope has to be to keep pivoting this to impeachment. POTTER Warren has managed to win the inside track on the \u201cchange\u201d message in a primary where voters\u2019 top concern is beating Donald Trump, and this debate is a chance to tie those threads together through the lens of corruption. While a process-heavy discussion of impeachment will likely be unhelpful to her, Warren could do herself a world of good by packaging the known facts surrounding Ukraine as an easy-to-understand tale of Washington influence-peddling. FINNEY Clearly the vision Warren is campaigning on is more popular than is being given credit, but she still has to keep making the case that her ideas can win in a general election. Her strategy ought to be to continue to convince voters that she can be the commander-in-chief, steward of our economy, and that these ideas can win. DUNN Follow the old rule of show, don\u2019t tell. Senator Sanders demonstrates that he is all vim and vigor by acting that way and not talking about it. Expect him to try and act the same as he has in every previous debate. KELLY First of all, I hope that Senator Sanders is healthy and fully recovers soon. But this is a real issue. Certainly, he\u2019ll need to show energy throughout the three-hour debate and make a strong case for himself, remaining engaged throughout. But ultimately, he is 78 years old and had a heart attack. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a tactical silver bullet for the debate stage that can change those facts or demonstrate that he\u2019s healthy enough to be president of the United States. O\u2019DONNELL The November debate will be too late to have a break out moment. He has to have a moment early in this debate where he commands the stage and gets the narrative moving in his direction. The problem for him has been identity and message. He needs to find both. All the money in the world can\u2019t buy that. He also needs to have a moment where he shows competitive advantage over one of the front-runners \u2014 Warren or Biden \u2014 by taking them on over an issue where he has a real different message. He should not waste time arguing with Beto O\u2019Rourke over guns. So if he doesn\u2019t differentiate himself, he\u2019ll be on the stage for the rest of the debates, but will be out of the media conversation and out of contention. POTTER Her success depends on getting multiple opportunities to deliver sharp, simple-to-understand critiques of President Trump. Harris\u2019s greatest success on the debate stage came from creating the impression she would badly outclass Trump in a general election debate, but she has generally been unable to build on that. Her campaign\u2019s goal should be to remind voters of her unique skills in this area, perhaps on an under-addressed issue such as reproductive rights. O\u2019DONNELL His only lane is a pragmatist, more moderate approach to policy. He can never beat Warren and Sanders on their agenda, so trying to position himself more in line with Biden has to be his approach. What does that mean for the debate? He has to take on Sanders or Warren and prove that his approach is better and take on Biden and prove he would be a better president than Biden. DUNN Senator Klobuchar has already been performing very, very well \u2014 but it is not moving the needle. That\u2019s a hard position to be in. Her best bet is to draw contrast with Senator Warren and try to use Warren\u2019s momentum to build her own. KALL He should try to take credit for the impeachment inquiry since he spent so much time and money on this process.

      "content": " It was an unusual juxtaposition for Democrats \u2014 calling a Republican president weak militarily. That\u2019s how the contenders for the party\u2019s nomination framed the recent withdrawal of American troops from northern Syria under President Trump, who they said during Tuesday night\u2019s debate had created turmoil with his impulsive foreign policy decision making. \u201cIt\u2019s been the most shameful thing any president has done in modern history in terms of foreign policy,\u201d former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said. While Democrats have been consumed with the Trump administration\u2019s dealings with Russia and Ukraine, the emerging foreign policy crisis in Syria presented a delicate test for the party\u2019s presidential hopefuls on the debate stage. It followed Mr. Trump\u2019s decision this month to withdraw American troops from northern Syria, one that has been sharply criticized by Republicans and now Democrats, who said it would endanger Kurdish allies in the region. Mr. Trump said he was trying to \u201cend the endless wars.\u201d Mr. Biden, a former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, called the move a betrayal and said it would throw Syria into chaos and embolden Islamic State militants. The issue appeared to give Mr. Biden an opening to burnish his foreign policy credentials and contrast himself with his main rivals, Senator Elizabeth Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders. \u201cThey lost their lives,\u201d Mr. Biden said of the Kurds. \u201cThis is shameful.\u201d Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., who served as an intelligence officer in the United States Navy Reserve and was deployed to Afghanistan, admonished Mr. Trump over the withdrawal. \u201cWhat we were doing in Syria was keeping our word,\u201d Mr. Buttigieg said. \u201cPart of what makes it possible for the United States to get people to put their lives on the line to back us up is the idea that we will back them up, too.\u201d \u201cWhen I was deployed, not just the Afghan national army forces but the janitors put their lives on the line just by working with U.S. forces,\u201d he continued. \u201cI would have a hard time today looking an Afghan civilian or soldier in the eye after what just happened over there.\u201d Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders both assailed Mr. Trump\u2019s abrupt withdrawal declaration, but both have long opposed American intervention in the conflict. \u201cSo, look, I think we ought to get out of the Middle East,\u201d Ms. Warren said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should have troops in the Middle East, but we have to do it the right way, the smart way.\u201d Mr. Sanders said Mr. Trump\u2019s credibility was completely undermined. \u201cNow you tell me what country in the world will trust the word of the president of the United States?\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cIn other words, what he has done is wreck our ability to do foreign policy, to do military policy, because nobody in the world will believe this pathological liar.\u201d And then there was Representative Tulsi Gabbard, whom Senator Kamala Harris had called an apologist for Syria\u2019s president, Bashar al-Assad. In 2017, Ms. Gabbard visited Mr. Assad, whose government used chemical weapons against rebels during a May 2018 attack in Syria\u2019s civil war, the United States concluded. Ms. Gabbard, who was deployed to Iraq, criticized the presence of American troops in Syria and the Trump administration\u2019s handling of their withdrawal, both of which she said contributed to the killing of Kurds by Turkish-backed forces. \u201cFirst of all, we\u2019ve got to understand the reality of the situation there, which is that the slaughter of the Kurds being done by Turkey is yet another negative consequence of the regime change war we\u2019ve been waging in Syria,\u201d Ms. Gabbard said. Despite the shared military service of Ms. Gabbard and Mr. Buttigieg, the two veterans split over whether to keep American troops in Syria. Mr. Buttigieg said that Ms. Gabbard was \u201cdead wrong,\u201d and that the slaughter was not caused by the presence of American troops but by the abrupt withdrawal of troops by the Trump administration. Ms. Gabbard responded: Mr. Buttigieg said Ms. Gabbard had aligned herself with the Trump administration on the issue. \u201cYou can put an end to endless war without embracing Donald Trump\u2019s policy, as you\u2019re doing,\u201d Mr. Buttigieg said. Ms. Gabbard said Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s stance didn\u2019t make sense. \u201cWhat is an endless war if it\u2019s not a regime change war?\u201d Ms. Gabbard said.",

      "content": " [Watch the debate and follow our live analysis here.] In the pivotal industrial state of Ohio, which has been devastated by the announced closure of a General Motors plant, the Democratic contenders railed against automation and the trade policies of the Trump administration during Tuesday night\u2019s debate. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said the greed of multinational corporations has chipped away at the middle class, which she vowed to strengthen with her plan to extend the solvency of Social Security and a $200 monthly benefits increase that she claimed would elevate five million families above the poverty line. The populist pitch of Senator Warren, who has made up ground on former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., came in a state that President Trump carried in 2016 and that is critical to his re-election prospects. \u201cThe data show that we have had a lot of problems with losing jobs,\u201d Senator Warren said. She continued: Andrew Yang, the former tech executive and entrepreneur, used the issue of automation to promote his universal basic income payment plan, which he has called a freedom dividend. \u201cSenator Warren, I have been talking to Americans around the country about automation,\u201d Mr. Yang said. He continued: The former housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro said the Trump administration has not delivered on its populist message in states like Ohio, where a stalemate between G.M. and the United Auto Workers culminated with the closure of the automaker\u2019s Lordstown plant and the loss of 14,000 jobs. G.M. has said that Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs on steel, aluminum and other goods have cost the company $1 billion in profits. \u201cI believe that we need to address a community being impacted by automation,\u201d Mr. Castro said. \u201cWe need to spark job opportunity. As I mentioned earlier, here in Ohio, in the latest jobs data, Ohio is losing jobs under Donald Trump.\u201d",

      "author": "Annie Karni",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Tuesday night\u2019s Democratic debate will play out with some unusual background noise coming from Washington: whistles being blown by multiple people. Former ambassadors, top foreign policy aides and once-loyal campaign donors are disregarding orders from the White House to ignore congressional subpoenas, trudging up to Capitol Hill for marathon sessions of closed-door testimony about President Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure Ukraine for political help. Former Trump aides are comparing each other to lethal weapons, and shadowy associates who did business for Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer are being indicted on campaign finance charges. To what degree this drumbeat of dissension and disorder shapes the discussion at the debate is one of the big questions facing the 12 candidates who will be onstage. This is the first debate since Speaker Nancy Pelosi declared the formal beginning of an impeachment inquiry last month. It\u2019s a lot of drama to compete with \u2014 it was revealed Monday night that John R. Bolton, the former national security adviser, compared Rudolph W. Giuliani to a \u201chand grenade,\u201d after all \u2014 especially when the point of Tuesday\u2019s debate is to compete with one another for the Democratic nomination. Add to the mix the fact that one candidate, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., was the target of the president\u2019s efforts to press a foreign power for political dirt, and will be under pressure to respond to the inquiry on Tuesday night. Even if the political chaos surrounding Mr. Trump looms over the program, the candidates should do their best to ignore it, according to some political strategists in both parties. \u201cThe best thing the candidates could do is to compartmentalize it,\u201d said Brian Fallon, who was the press secretary for Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign. \u201cThere\u2019s very little opportunity for separation among the candidates, based on how they talk about Trump.\u201d Brendan Buck, a past adviser to former Speaker Paul D. Ryan, said a debate where everyone agrees that Mr. Trump deserves to be impeached is a snooze and a wasted opportunity. \u201cOther than Biden having his opportunity to say his piece, they\u2019re generally better off leaving this debate to Nancy Pelosi,\u201d Mr. Buck said. The impeachment probe, he said, \u201cisn\u2019t terribly tangible to people\u2019s lives.\u201d Nor is it how most Americans would like to see Mr. Trump leave office. A recent NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll found that 58 percent of Americans think Mr. Trump\u2019s fate should be decided by voters next November, compared to 37 percent who think it should be decided by the impeachment process. (Even so, 52 percent of respondents in that poll approved of the decision to begin the impeachment inquiry.) The focus on impeachment may make it difficult for lower-polling candidates like Beto O\u2019Rourke, the former Texas congressman, or Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey to break through. But Democrats said that over all, the inquiry would be a huge gift to whoever emerged as the party\u2019s nominee. \u201cIt\u2019s creating a permanent black cloud that will ultimately help the Democratic nominee,\u201d Mr. Fallon said, pointing to the earned media coverage of impeachment as a way for Democrats to close the messaging gap with the Trump campaign, which is vastly outspending them online. \u201cIt\u2019s defining him in a way none of the individual campaigns could do during a primary,\u201d Mr. Fallon said. \u201cThey should all be thanking their lucky stars.\u201d",

      "author": "Shane Goldmacher",
      "content": "   The Democratic field has lined up squarely behind Joseph R. Biden Jr. over President Trump\u2019s baseless allegations that, as vice president, Mr. Biden acted improperly to benefit his son\u2019s overseas business interests. But for many of Mr. Biden\u2019s rivals, the tougher question has been whether they think his son, Hunter Biden, should have been working for foreign interests while his father was vice president. On Sunday, the lawyer for the younger Mr. Biden said he was stepping down from the board of a Chinese company and would refrain from working for \u201cforeign-owned companies\u201d if his father was elected president. And in an interview with ABC News released this morning, Hunter Biden shared more of his side of the story, saying that while he showed \u201cpoor judgment\u201d in accepting the board position, Mr. Trump\u2019s accusations of wrongdoing were \u201cridiculous.\u201d How Mr. Biden handles questions about his son will be closely watched, as will how the rest of the field balances addressing Hunter Biden\u2019s work with denouncing Mr. Trump. Since his heart attack two weeks ago in Las Vegas and the insertion of two stents to clear a blocked artery, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has been off the campaign trail recovering, mostly at his home in Burlington, Vt. While Mr. Sanders, 78, has sat for interviews, spoken to press on the street outside his home and recorded videos, the debate will be his biggest event since his heart attack. While most of the candidates have political objectives on Tuesday, Mr. Sanders has a different kind of hurdle to clear, as his former adviser Mark Longabaugh told our colleague Sydney Ember. \u201cI think he has only one objective in this debate, and that\u2019s just to show that he\u2019s healthy,\u201d Mr. Longabaugh said. Mr. Sanders said last week the medical episode would \u201cchange the nature\u201d of his campaign, which has been among the most punishing in the field. \u201cWe were doing, you know, in some cases five or six meetings a day, three or four rallies and town meetings and meeting with groups of people,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to do that.\u201d But Mr. Sanders quickly said that he had been misinterpreted and that his candidacy will continue full steam ahead. The first and biggest test will be how he performs at the debate. For weeks now, as she\u2019s cemented herself as a fellow front-runner alongside Mr. Biden, the word has been that Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts would see more sustained scrutiny from her fellow candidates. It hasn\u2019t quite happened yet. But this may be beginning to change. Without naming Ms. Warren, Mr. Biden last week, called her health care plan \u201cdishonest.\u201d Mr. Sanders contrasted himself with Ms. Warren by saying she is \u201ca capitalist through her bones,\u201d while he is not. So far, Ms. Warren has been extremely lucky as a presidential candidate. At each moment when the heat on her has turned up, something happened to dial it down. Last month when Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and others, including the late-night host Stephen Colbert, criticized her for refusing to say whether the middle class would pay for her health care proposal, attention quickly shifted to Mr. Trump\u2019s conduct on a call with the Ukrainian president. When Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign made the embarrassing revelation that it fired a senior staffer who faced sexual harassment allegations, the Sanders campaign moments later announced that the Vermont senator had suffered a heart attack. Polls of early-state voters show that Ms. Warren is the most popular Democratic presidential candidate, but that\u2019s in part because no other candidate has taken a shot at her. If none do on Tuesday, it will be another month before their next best chance to do so. After three debates that each began with in-the-weeds discussions about health care policy, Tuesday\u2019s face-off in Ohio comes in the midst of an impeachment inquiry of Mr. Trump and after a weekend of cataclysmic fallout after Mr. Trump abruptly changed United States policy in Syria. The debate is the first opportunity for the 12 candidates onstage \u2014 who have each endorsed impeaching Mr. Trump \u2014 to demonstrate contrasting visions of how they would address the president. While each of the Democratic candidates have condemned Mr. Trump\u2019s action and conduct in the White House, they all realize there is danger in placing opposition to him at the center of their campaigns. Democratic primary voters loathe the president, but on the campaign trail few ask the candidates to respond to the latest outrage of the day \u2014 let alone the foreign policy legacy of the Iraq war. Voters, the candidates know by now, want to know the specifics about how their platforms will make their lives better, what policies they will seek to implement as president and, perhaps most of all, how they can win a general election. While the candidates are onstage, their bookkeepers will be busy with an entirely different event: formally disclosing how much their campaigns raised and spent in July, August and September. Almost all the candidates \u2014 besides Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former housing secretary, and Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii \u2014 have announced how much they have raised, with Mr. Sanders pacing the field with $25.3 million. But the top lines are hardly the only interesting element of the disclosures. While Mr. Sanders, Ms. Warren and Senator Kamala Harris of California have all disclosed how much cash they will have on hand heading into the final quarter of 2019, Mr. Biden notably did not. The general rule of thumb for such things is that campaigns release good news early and hold bad news for as long as possible. (Former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas did not disclose his dismal $3.6 million second-quarter haul until hours before the previous deadline, for instance.) That bodes ill for Mr. Castro\u2019s financial state of affairs and Mr. Biden\u2019s cash-on-hand.",

      "author": "Alexander Burns",
      "content": "  WESTERVILLE, Ohio \u2014 Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts faced a sustained barrage of criticism from her Democratic rivals at a presidential debate in Ohio on Tuesday, tangling with a group of underdog moderates who assailed her liberal economic proposals, while former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. appeared to fade from the fray after parrying President Trump\u2019s attacks on his family. The debate confirmed that the primary race had entered a new phase, defined by Ms. Warren\u2019s apparent strength and the increasing willingness of other Democrats to challenge her. She has risen toward the top of the polls while confronting limited resistance from her opponents, and in past debates she attracted a fraction of the hostility that Democrats trained on Mr. Biden. That changed in a dramatic fashion on Tuesday, when a group of her rivals voiced sharp skepticism of Ms. Warren\u2019s agenda or accused her of taking impractical stances on issues like health care and taxation. Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., insistently charged Ms. Warren with evading a \u201cyes-or-no\u201d question on how she would pay for a \u201cMedicare for all\u201d health care system, while Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota cast parts of Ms. Warren\u2019s platform as a \u201cpipe dream.\u201d Former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas branded Ms. Warren\u2019s worldview as overly \u201cpunitive.\u201d Ms. Warren sought at every turn to dispense with her critics by casting them as lacking ambition or political grit. When she addressed criticism of her proposal to tax vast private fortunes, for instance, Ms. Warren suggested her opponents believed it was \u201cmore important to protect billionaires than it is to invest in an entire generation\u201d but did not single out her rivals. The debate unfolded in a drastically altered political landscape, with Mr. Trump facing impeachment and Mr. Biden in the center of a firestorm over his son\u2019s  overseas financial dealings. The candidates were prompted to cover a wide range of issues, including a number that had featured little or not at all in past debates \u2014 not just the impeachment of Mr. Trump, but the Turkish invasion of Syria, and the details of gun control policy and the taxation of great wealth. The moderators began with a series of questions about impeachment to each of the 12 candidates \u2014 the largest field ever for a primary debate \u2014 affording them an opportunity to denounce Mr. Trump. And Mr. Biden was quickly asked about his son Hunter Biden\u2019s overseas financial work, delivering a narrow, repetitive answer in which he said neither he nor his son had done anything wrong. Foreign policy played a greater role on Tuesday evening than in any other debate, pushed to the political foreground by the renewed outbreak of war and humanitarian catastrophe in Syria. The Democrats chiefly trained their attention on Mr. Trump\u2019s role in instigating the crisis there: For instance, Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former housing secretary, condemned Mr. Trump for \u201ccaging kids on the border and letting ISIS prisoners run free\u201d in Syria. With Mr. Biden a diminished force, Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Klobuchar appeared determined to present themselves as strong alternatives for voters in the middle. Both emphasized their Midwestern credentials, and Mr. Buttigieg invoked his experience as a military veteran in several wide-ranging answers on foreign policy. Their new aggressiveness represented a shorter-term calculation about halting Ms. Warren\u2019s increasing strength in Iowa. With Ms. Warren gaining there, Ms. Klobuchar and Mr. Buttigieg plainly decided to target her in an effort to appeal to the state\u2019s moderate voters, who so far have lined up with Mr. Biden. With a powerfully funded campaign and an expanding field operation in Iowa, Mr. Buttigieg may be uniquely well positioned to assert himself there. In an intense argument that reflected their changing fortunes in the race, Mr. Biden briefly went on the offensive against Ms. Warren toward the end of the debate, describing her health care plans as \u201cvague\u201d and demanding in a raised voice that she give him some credit for her signature accomplishment, the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau after the 2008 financial crisis. Ms. Warren expressed gratitude for the help she had received \u2014 not from Mr. Biden but from former President Barack Obama. But Ms. Warren was on the defensive for much of the evening and most of all on the issue of single-payer health care, when she again declined to specify precisely how she would fund a sweeping system of government-backed insurance. Unlike Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Ms. Warren has not acknowledged in plain terms that a \u201cMedicare for all\u201d plan would quite likely have to substitute broad-based taxes for private insurance premiums and other costs. \u201cI will not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle-class families,\u201d Ms. Warren said, declining to elaborate. Ms. Klobuchar, in her most assertive debate performance yet, chided Ms. Warren for not explaining to voters \u201cwhere we\u2019re going to send the invoice\u201d for single-payer care. \u201cAt least Bernie\u2019s being honest here,\u201d Ms. Klobuchar said. Ms. Warren was squeezed, at times, from the left as well: While Mr. Sanders never broke their informal nonaggression pact, he agreed with several of the moderates that it was \u201cappropriate\u201d to enumerate the financial trade-offs involved in single-payer health care, including taxes on Americans that would be \u201csubstantially less than what they were paying for premiums and out-of-pocket expenses.\u201d And while Mr. Sanders, who had a heart attack this month, was forced to address new concerns about his health, his campaign aides confirmed during the debate that he had secured an endorsement from Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York that could inject new energy into his candidacy. But there were also the germs of a broader discussion of the role of the United States in the Middle East: In an intense exchange between the two military veterans onstage, Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii said that it was not only Mr. Trump who had \u201cthe blood of the Kurds on his hands,\u201d but also politicians in both parties and news media organizations that had cheered for \u201cregime change war.\u201d Her remarks drew forceful pushback from Mr. Buttigieg, who said Ms. Gabbard was \u201cdead wrong,\u201d arguing that \u201cthe slaughter going on in Syria is not a consequence of American presence \u2014 it is a consequence of a withdrawal and a betrayal by this president of American allies and American values.\u201d While Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren did not clash directly over foreign policy, they diverged in a stark fashion over the situation in Syria. Mr. Biden said he would want to keep American troops there and convey to the Turkish government that it would pay a \u201cheavy price\u201d for its invasion. Ms. Warren said she opposed Mr. Trump\u2019s handling of the situation but believed the United States should \u201cget out of the Middle East.\u201d (Aides to Ms. Warren said she was referring to the withdrawal of troops from combat.) Throughout the debate, which was sponsored by CNN and The New York Times, Mr. Biden played a far less central role than he did in the past, stepping to the foreground for exchanges over foreign policy but otherwise taking a more passive approach. His most important moment of the night may have come early on, when he was pressed by a moderator to explain why his son had not crossed any ethical lines by doing business in Ukraine while his father was overseeing diplomacy there for the Obama administration. Mr. Biden said several times that he and his son had done \u201cnothing wrong,\u201d and alluded repeatedly to an interview Hunter Biden gave to ABC News, in which he said it had been an error in judgment to sit on the board of a Ukrainian gas company while the elder Mr. Biden was vice president. Mr. Trump has accused the Bidens of corruption, often in false or exaggerated terms, and his efforts to enlist the government of Ukraine in tarring Mr. Biden instigated an impeachment inquiry. \u201cThis is about Trump\u2019s corruption,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we should be focusing on.\u201d None of Mr. Biden\u2019s Democratic rivals chose to press the subject, reflecting both the political sensitivity of issues touching on Mr. Biden\u2019s family and also a calculation, by his most immediate rivals, that Mr. Biden is likely to continue sinking in the race without a further onslaught from fellow Democrats. While a number of candidates are hoping to peel away moderate voters from Mr. Biden, they tried to do so on Tuesday by challenging the left rather than by blasting the leading candidate of the center. Defending his political stature, Mr. Biden at one point described himself as \u201cthe only one on this stage who has gotten anything really big done,\u201d and cited his work on the Violence Against Women Act and the Obama administration\u2019s health care law. That argument drew a fierce response from Mr. Sanders, who said Mr. Biden had also achieved far less laudable feats, like the passage of the NAFTA trade deal and a law tightening the federal bankruptcy code. \u201cYou got the disastrous war in Iraq done,\u201d Mr. Sanders added. And Ms. Warren, too, took issue with Mr. Biden\u2019s claim, pointing to her role as the architect of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau \u2014 an agency, she said, that represented \u201cstructural change in our economy.\u201d In a moment of crackling tension, Mr. Biden raised his voice and urged Ms. Warren to give him credit, too, for the birth of the agency. \u201cI went onto the floor and got you votes,\u201d he said. Ms. Warren retorted by saying she was \u201cdeeply grateful for President Obama, who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law,\u201d as well as for others in the administration who did the same. Just as striking as the offensives by Ms. Klobuchar and Mr. Buttigieg were the more passive showings by Senators Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris \u2014 both of whom were counting on a strong outing. Mr. Booker repeatedly said the focus of the debate should be on Mr. Trump. He denounced the moderators\u2019 questions about Mr. Biden\u2019s son. \u201cThe only person sitting at home enjoying that was Donald Trump,\u201d Mr. Booker said. And he even defended the fitness of the septuagenarian candidates onstage \u2014 Mr. Biden, Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren \u2014 by noting that Mr. Trump would be the least healthy candidate running in 2020. Ms. Harris also mostly trained her fire on the president, at one point using her new catch line: \u201cDude gotta go.\u201d The only moment when Ms. Harris showed any appetite for tangling with the other candidates was when she demanded to know why Ms. Warren would not join her in urging Twitter to remove the president\u2019s account. Ms. Harris seemed more focused on trying to build support with women, as she spoke most forcefully about the importance of defending abortion rights. \u201cIt is her body, it is her right, it is her decision,\u201d she said. After presenting her message at the previous three debates with only intermittent challenges from her rivals, Ms. Warren was met with cutting criticism of her signature populist flourishes. \u201cI want to give a reality check to Elizabeth,\u201d said Ms. Klobuchar, before alluding to another candidate onstage, the hedge fund executive Tom Steyer. \u201cNo one on this stage wants to protect billionaires. Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires. We just have different approaches.\u201d Mr. Buttigieg was just as pointed, repeatedly casting Ms. Warren as a \u201cWashington politician,\u201d but he and Ms. Klobuchar were not alone. Even lagging candidates such as Mr. O\u2019Rourke and Andrew Yang, a former tech entrepreneur, took on Ms. Warren, all but confirming her front-runner status. And while she was eager to articulate her progressive vision here, Ms. Warren seemed just as cognizant that she must broaden her coalition beyond her core base of upscale liberal whites. She repeatedly cited her support for adding funding to historically black colleges and mentioned her brothers, who still live in her native Oklahoma and two of whom are Republicans. Mr. Sanders was not as ubiquitous a presence as he had been at past debates, but he drew applause by pre-empting a question about his health. \u201cI\u2019m healthy, I\u2019m feeling great,\u201d he said before vowing \u201ca vigorous campaign.\u201d That, Mr. Sanders said, \u201cis how I think I can reassure the American people.\u201d",

      "author": "Matt Flegenheimer",
      "content": "  WESTERVILLE, Ohio \u2014 Senator Elizabeth Warren looked down, performatively taken aback. She raised her hand to speak \u2014 surely it was her turn again. She shrugged a little. For about an hour on Tuesday, Ms. Warren had been the prime target of her debate rivals, compelled to defend as never before the hard-charging progressivism and soak-the-rich economic approach that has elevated her to the top of the polls. Beto O\u2019Rourke, the former Texas congressman, had a theory about all of that. \u201cSometimes, I think Senator Warren is more focused on being punitive or pitting some part of the country against the other,\u201d he said, using a question about the wealth tax to lash Ms. Warren\u2019s broader political philosophy, \u201cinstead of lifting people up and making sure this country comes together.\u201d Ms. Warren turned to Mr. O\u2019Rourke, then back to the cameras. \u201cSo, um, I\u2019m really shocked at the notion that anyone thinks I\u2019m punitive,\u201d she said. Perhaps. But she should not have been surprised. For months, Ms. Warren had moved largely unimpeded in her brisk jog to the front of the 2020 Democratic pack, coasting through debates without incident as her calls for \u201cbig structural change\u201d took hold and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. absorbed the unforgiving glare afforded the favorite. Time and again this year, moderators had invited Ms. Warren\u2019s top competitors to attack her. Time and again, they had done so gently, if at all. This time, Mr. O\u2019Rourke went after her. Pete Buttigieg, the millennial mayor of South Bend, Ind., did the same early in the evening in a slashing exchange on health care. Andrew Yang said she was wrong on the wealth tax. Senator Kamala Harris smiled as she and Ms. Warren sparred over whether to regulate President Trump\u2019s tweets. Mr. Biden initiated his most direct debate-stage confrontation with Ms. Warren to date, saying she was \u201cbeing vague\u201d in campaign proposals. This was Ms. Warren\u2019s reward for achieving co-front-runner (and maybe outright front-runner) status: persistent sniping from fellow Democrats who see her surge as the most urgent threat to their own paths to the nomination. Ms. Warren greeted the deluge with mixed success, never wobbling too precariously but retreating at times to the safe harbor of stump-speech platitudes. On occasion, she appeared so eager to avoid the fray that she could give the impression that she was not engaging with the substance. \u201cA yes-or-no question that didn\u2019t get a yes-or-no answer,\u201d Mr. Buttigieg observed at one point. The fresh antipathy was all the more striking for its contrast with the treatment of two fellow contenders whose campaigns have been consumed by drama of late. Shortly after his recent heart attack, Senator Bernie Sanders attracted little meaningful criticism, on policy matters or his health. He will receive a boost this weekend with the expected endorsement of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the New York congresswoman who has emerged as an impassioned gatekeeper of the left. And Mr. Biden, straining to keep his grip on the race, survived an early dissection of the impeachment inquiry that centers on Mr. Trump\u2019s urging of the Ukrainian president to investigate Mr. Biden and his son Hunter. While the candidates plainly saw little incentive in questioning whether Hunter Biden had traded on the family name in dealings abroad \u2014 lest they be seen as doing the president\u2019s bidding \u2014 their deference itself was damning: Other campaigns have long expected Mr. Biden to falter on his own, viewing Ms. Warren as the more nettlesome long-term headache, and the former vice president\u2019s performance on Tuesday quite likely did little to alter their calculation. The moment that Mr. Biden had prepared for came early. Asked about his son in the debate\u2019s opening minutes, Mr. Biden worked to summon the righteous fury and stern statesman\u2019s gaze perfected over his half-century in public life. \u201cMy son did nothing wrong,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cI did nothing wrong.\u201d At times, his delivery was wobbly, as it tends to be. He stopped and started a bit. He cited George Washington. But he worked toward the conclusion he has been repeating often on the campaign trail. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want me to be the candidate,\u201d Mr. Biden said of the president. \u201cHe is going after me because he knows if I get the nomination, I will beat him like a drum.\u201d Before the debate, several rivals had come to Mr. Biden\u2019s defense, plainly mindful of the limits and potential downsides of condemning peers so far this year \u2014 and of condemning Mr. Biden on this subject in particular. None made an issue of Mr. Biden\u2019s family on Tuesday. At the previous three debates, Mr. Biden had been the focus of attacks both glancing and sharply personal. Yet the candidates who have gone after Mr. Biden frontally \u2014 including Ms. Harris; Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former federal housing secretary; and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, who has left the race \u2014 have seen few lasting benefits. In some cases, such as Mr. Castro\u2019s, the effort appeared to backfire with some Democratic voters and officials who are eager to keep the focus on Mr. Trump. Taking on Ms. Warren brought risks of its own, given her popularity with the party\u2019s base and the scant evidence throughout this primary that voters are inclined to reward infighting of any sort. But less than four months before the Iowa caucuses, her competitors have determined that complacency will not suffice. Mr. Buttigieg was the first aggressor, a few minutes into the debate in Westerville. He had been asked about Ms. Warren\u2019s support for Medicare for All and her squishy responses to the question of whether middle-class taxes would rise under it. This was the candidate with \u201ca plan for everything,\u201d Mr. Buttigieg taunted, \u201cexcept this.\u201d Ms. Warren\u2019s head shot skyward. \u201cWe can pay for this,\u201d she insisted, repeating that \u201ccosts\u201d would rise only for the wealthy and declining to concede \u2014 as Mr. Sanders, her comrade-in-health-care-policy, has \u2014 that middle-class taxes would go up. Amy Klobuchar, a moderate Senate peer who has leveled few attacks from the stage all year, was having none of it. \u201cAt least Bernie\u2019s being honest here,\u201d she said. The debate, the fourth of the campaign, came during a period of momentum for Ms. Warren, who has moved into a lead position, topping Mr. Biden in some surveys both nationally and in early-voting primary states. At the previous debate, Mr. Biden quickly abandoned mannerly efforts to draw contrasts with her, and other high-polling rivals had until Tuesday largely refrained from issuing piercing criticism onstage. But in the lead-up to the debate, several contenders had telegraphed arguments against Ms. Warren. At a fund-raiser last week, Mr. Biden made an oblique jab, saying that to claim that Medicare for All is achievable without a significant increase of taxes \u201cnot just for the wealthy but across the board is just not honest.\u201d And on Tuesday morning, Mr. Buttigieg released a digital ad that swiped at Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders over their support for Medicare for All, a sweeping single-payer plan that would all but eliminate private health insurance. The two leading candidates had avoided flashes of explosive confrontation with each other until around the final half-hour of the debate, when Mr. Biden said, \u201cI\u2019m the only one who has gotten anything really big done,\u201d criticizing Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders for advocating overly general ideas on issues like health care. Ms. Warren went on to point to her role in helping to create the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau during the Obama administration. \u201cI agreed with the great job she did,\u201d Mr. Biden said. Turning to face Ms. Warren, jabbing his hand in her direction, the former vice president\u2019s voice rose. \u201cAnd I went out on the floor and got you votes. I got votes for that bill. I convinced people to vote for it. So let\u2019s get those things straight, too.\u201d Some in the room applauded. \u201cI am deeply grateful to President Obama,\u201d she said pointedly \u2014 as his vice president grinned \u2014 \u201cwho fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law, and I am deeply grateful to every single person who fought for it and who helped pass it into law.\u201d \u201cYou did a hell of a job at your job,\u201d Mr. Biden said, interrupting her. Less clear was Mr. Biden\u2019s appraisal of Ms. Warren in her new role: the co-favorite.",

      "author": "Shane Goldmacher",
      "content": "  WESTERVILLE, Ohio \u2014 The CNN/New York Times debate on Tuesday night revealed new dynamics in the Democratic presidential race: Senator Elizabeth Warren took sustained fire from multiple rivals, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. struggled to make an impact and Mayor Pete Buttigieg and other candidates were newly aggressive in making their points. Here are six takeaways from the debate: For the first time this year, Ms. Warren was frequently called out and criticized by her rivals: For a candidate who has risen in the polls based on her policy acumen and specifics, Ms. Warren\u2019s unwillingness to address the question of whether her \u201cMedicare for all\u201d plan would require higher taxes on the middle class was striking. And her opponents put her on the defensive. Ms. Warren in large part survived the attacks, though she never did answer questions about whether she\u2019d raise those middle-class taxes. Nor did she explain to Ms. Harris why she thought Mr. Trump should remain on Twitter. But she did present a concise counterargument, saying that only her ambitious ideas could produce an electoral mandate from disaffected Americans to defeat Mr. Trump. In all, the debate served as a certification of Ms. Warren\u2019s status as one of two front-runners in the race, alongside Mr. Biden. It also crystallized much of the 19-way race as a contest to be the Biden alternative. The candidates sparring with Ms. Warren were auditioning to Democratic voters not just how they would go toe-to-toe with President Trump, but also how they would stack up against Ms. Warren as the campaign narrows to just a few candidates. Unlike in the previous three debates, nobody instigated a fight with Mr. Biden. It was both a sign of his diminished status in the race \u2014 he\u2019s no longer the solo front-runner, having ceded ground to Ms. Warren \u2014 as well as evidence that attacking Mr. Biden hasn\u2019t served his rivals well when they\u2019ve tried. The toughest moment for Mr. Biden came when the moderators pressed him on his son Hunter Biden\u2019s work in Ukraine. When no candidate pressed him on the topic, it faded from the discussion after Mr. Biden delivered a garbled and wobbly explanation. Mr. Biden, as is his custom, at times wandered away from the question at hand. During a monologue about tax rates, he bemoaned the size of the field and the relatively brief amount of time allotted candidates to answer questions. He was strongest when on offense against Ms. Warren. But it was a telling sign that his rivals tried to present themselves as a Biden alternative by contrasting themselves with Ms. Warren instead of Mr. Biden. She, not the former vice president, looked like the candidate to beat on Tuesday night. He railed against billionaires. He pitched \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d He tossed out his campaign URL. He said \u201cdamn\u201d \u2014 twice. It was vintage Bernie Sanders on Tuesday \u2014 and that was a relief to his supporters and advisers two weeks after Mr. Sanders, 78, suffered a heart attack. \u201cI\u2019m healthy, I\u2019m feeling great,\u201d Mr. Sanders said as the debate approached the two-hour mark. But by then he had made that case with his performance, dueling with Mr. Biden over their ideological differences and thrusting his arm into the air to seek more airtime. \u201cWe are going to be mounting a vigorous campaign all over this country. That is how I think I can reassure the American people,\u201d Mr. Sanders said when asked about his health. When Senator Cory Booker interjected with a joke that Mr. Sanders also supports medical marijuana, Mr. Sanders did not hesitate with the retort, \u201cI\u2019m not on it tonight.\u201d He may not have won over new supporters, but he looked like the same old Bernie Sanders. For this debate, that was more than enough. For months, Mr. Buttigieg has been satisfied to make most of his points at the debates without scoring them at the expense of his rivals. That ended Tuesday. Mr. Buttigieg sparred sharply with former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke on guns. He rebuked Representative Tulsi Gabbard on foreign policy. And, most notably, he engaged in the most substantive and sustained contrast of any candidate yet with Ms. Warren. It was Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s exchange with Ms. Warren over \u201cMedicare for all\u201d that was most memorable, pressing her as she declined to say, yet again, whether her plan would require a middle-class tax increase. (She says her plan would curb middle-class \u201ccosts.\u201d) \u201cA yes-or-no question that did not get a yes-or-no answer,\u201d Mr. Buttigieg said, adding, \u201cYour signature, senator, is to have a plan for everything. Except this.\u201d He rattled off how her plan would \u201cobliterate\u201d the private health insurance of 150 million Americans while pitching his \u201cMedicare for all who want it\u201d alternative. Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s rebuke of Mr. O\u2019Rourke \u2014 \u201cI don\u2019t need lessons from you on courage\u201d \u2014 may lend itself more to a viral moment. But the bigger leap was to be seen as a foil to Ms. Warren. It felt at times on Tuesday as if the sprawling 12-person stage had actually narrowed to a four-person debate, with Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders representing the left, and Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg representing the center-left. The occasional television shot of just those four served to hammer home the point. Mr. Booker and Ms. Harris were not the main course on Tuesday. They were the palate cleansers. They came into the debate struggling for support and attention. And it was apparent by the end of the first hour that they had adopted a similar game plan: seeking to rise above the fray and food fight unfolding around them while punching at President Trump. \u201cTearing each other down because we have a different plan is unacceptable,\u201d Mr. Booker said. He had been the first candidate to castigate the media for asking Mr. Biden questions about his son\u2019s work in Ukraine. At one point, Ms. Harris aired a complaint that women\u2019s advocates have pressed for months: the lack of questions about abortion. \u201cThis is the sixth debate we have had in this presidential cycle. Not one word with all of these discussions about health care, on women\u2019s access to health care. It\u2019s outrageous,\u201d Ms. Harris said. On Tuesday, both Ms. Harris and Mr. Booker hit Mr. Trump harder on foreign affairs than any rivals onstage. This is not a new strategy. Ms. Harris focused on Mr. Trump during the last debate, too. And for two candidates who have punched their ticket to November, this was a bloodless way to sell themselves without much risk on a crowded stage. The sixth night of Democratic presidential debates delivered three hours of discussion but no signature moments and little likely to be remembered when the primaries and caucuses begin in February. The most contentious exchanges \u2014 between Ms. Warren and Mr. Buttigieg, and then again between Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren \u2014 were intermittent, spaced throughout a debate that by obligation had to include seven candidates who haven\u2019t sniffed 5 percent in a poll in months. With so many low-polling candidates obligated to get speaking time, too, the debate meandered through exchanges with Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. O\u2019Rourke and the former housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, each of whom faces long odds to appear at the party\u2019s next debate on Nov. 20 in Atlanta. The billionaire investor Tom Steyer was there, too, though in his first debate appearance, he spent more time introducing himself to Democratic voters than he did making a case for why he\u2019d be better than anyone else onstage. While exposing the divisions between the party\u2019s factions, the most taut moments of contrast served more as an example of what is to come once the field shrinks.",

SchmidtPRINT EDITIONE.U. Envoy Testifies That Trump Delegated Policy to Giuliani|October 18, 2019, Page A16",
      "author": "Nicholas Fandos",
      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 Gordon D. Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union, told House impeachment investigators on Thursday that President Trump delegated American foreign policy on Ukraine to his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani, a directive he said he disagreed with but nonetheless followed. Mr. Sondland, a Trump campaign donor who has emerged as a central figure in the Ukraine scandal, testified under subpoena that he did not understand until later that Mr. Giuliani\u2019s goal may have been an effort \u201cto involve Ukrainians, directly or indirectly, in the president\u2019s 2020 re-election campaign.\u201d According to a copy of his opening statement to investigators, which was obtained by The New York Times, Mr. Sondland said Mr. Trump refused the counsel of his top diplomats, who recommended that he meet with the new Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, without any preconditions. The president said  the diplomats needed to satisfy concerns that both he and Mr. Giuliani had related to corruption in Ukraine, Mr. Sondland asserted. \u201cWe were also disappointed by the president\u2019s direction that we involve Mr. Giuliani,\u201d Mr. Sondland said. \u201cOur view was that the men and women of the State Department, not the president\u2019s personal lawyer, should take responsibility for all aspects of U.S. foreign policy toward Ukraine.\u201d His account is at odds with testimony from some foreign policy officials. They have portrayed Mr. Sondland as a willing participant who inserted himself into Ukraine policy even though the country is not in the purview of his posting, and was a key player in Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to win a commitment from the new Ukrainian government to investigate his political rivals. It emerged as Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, told reporters that the Trump administration withheld nearly $400 million in military aid to pressure Ukraine to investigate whether Kiev helped the Democrats during the 2016 election, an unsubstantiated theory that the president has long espoused. But hours later, Mr. Mulvaney denied what he had said earlier, charging that the news media had misreported his account despite the fact that his words were captured on camera. \u201cLet me be clear,\u201d Mr. Mulvaney said in his statement backing away from remarks he had made at a news conference. \u201cThere was absolutely no quid pro quo between Ukrainian military aid and any investigation into the 2016 election,\u201d he said. Mr. Mulvaney also said there had been nothing wrong with Mr. Trump relying on Mr. Giuliani to conduct foreign policy. \u201cThat\u2019s the president\u2019s call,\u201d he said. \u201cYou may not like the fact that Giuliani was involved. That\u2019s great, that\u2019s fine. It\u2019s not illegal, it\u2019s not impeachable.\u201d Yet Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s public admission, however muddled, and Mr. Sondland\u2019s private testimony confirmed central elements of the saga at the heart of the impeachment inquiry, which is focused on a shadow diplomatic campaign, carried out by Mr. Giuliani at Mr. Trump\u2019s direction, to pressure Ukraine to investigate the Democrats. Some lawmakers who heard it said Mr. Sondland\u2019s story appeared meant to insulate him from blame. As she emerged from the first two hours of questioning, Representative Jackie Speier, Democrat of California and a member of the Intelligence Committee, called his remarks \u201ca lot of C.Y.A.\u201d Others said he repeatedly said he could not remember details of relevant events. Mr. Sondland spent more than nine hours on Capitol Hill  taking his turn in the secure rooms of the House Intelligence Committee, as the latest top foreign policy official to appear before impeachment investigators who are digging into a whistle-blower complaint about Mr. Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine. His testimony, which the Trump administration initially sought to block, was a matter of intense interest for the investigators as they tried to fill out a picture of what transpired this summer as Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani ratcheted up the pressure on the Ukrainians to investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and other Democrats. Even as Mr. Sondland answered questions, lawmakers and their aides were preparing for a crush of additional closed-door witness depositions in the coming days that will reach further into the diplomatic corps and the White House. They have scheduled sessions with two Pentagon officials, Laura Cooper and Kathryn Wheelbarger, and two top White House budget officials, Russell Vought and Michael Duffey, who could help address lingering questions about whether Mr. Trump\u2019s decision this summer to freeze the aid was tied to the pressure campaign. Questions about the aid will also likely be put to William B. Taylor Jr., a career diplomat in Ukraine who raised concerns with Mr. Sondland about the aid freeze, and two National Security Council officials, Alexander Vindman and Timothy Morrison. And investigators also plan to interview Philip Reeker, a top European affairs official at the State Department, and Suriya Jayanti, a Foreign Service officer in Kiev. Testimony from career diplomats and a former top White House foreign policy adviser in recent days has suggested that Mr. Sondland, a wealthy hotelier from Oregon who had no political experience, was at the heart of the effort to go around normal diplomatic channels to pressure the Ukrainians. But he presented a more complicated account, describing himself as a well-meaning and at times unwitting player who was trying to conduct American foreign policy with Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Trump standing in the way. He noted several times that he had \u201cthe blessing\u201d of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. And he said if White House officials considered his actions inappropriate, as a former top National Security Council testified earlier this week that she did, they never raised the topic with him. Mr. Sondland said Mr. Trump put him and top diplomats and administration officials dealing with Ukraine in an impossible position, as they tried to conduct diplomacy with an important European ally. A person familiar with the  deposition who was not authorized to discuss it publicly said Mr. Sondland had not tried to shield his conversations with Mr. Trump from investigators, and answered questions from Democratic and Republican staff. \u201cPlease know that I would not have recommended that Mr. Giuliani or any private citizen be involved in these foreign policy matters,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, given the president\u2019s explicit direction, as well as the importance we attached to arranging a White House meeting between Presidents Trump and Zelensky, we agreed to do as President Trump directed.\u201d Mr. Sondland testified that he, Kurt D. Volker, the special envoy to Ukraine, and Rick Perry, the energy secretary, began coordinating with Mr. Giuliani, who insisted that the Ukrainians put out a statement committing to a series of investigations. The ambassador said he failed to appreciate how Burisma, a company that Mr. Giuliani wanted the Ukrainians to look into, was directly tied to Hunter Biden, the former vice president\u2019s son. \u201cAlthough Mr. Giuliani did mention the name \u2018Burisma\u2019 in August 2019, I understood that Burisma was one of many examples of Ukrainian companies run by oligarchs and lacking the type of corporate governance structures found in Western companies,\u201d Mr. Sondland said. \u201cI did not know until more recent press reports that Hunter Biden was on the board of Burisma.\u201d Hunter Biden\u2019s involvement with Burisma had been widely reported beginning in the spring. Mr. Sondland said he had ultimately learned that Mr. Giuliani had singled out two topics for investigation by the Ukrainians that could benefit the president politically. \u201cI did not understand, until much later, that Mr. Giuliani\u2019s agenda might have also included an effort to prompt the Ukrainians to investigate Vice President Biden or his son or to involve Ukrainians, directly or indirectly, in the president\u2019s 2020 re-election campaign,\u201d he told investigators. Mr. Sondland sought to distance himself from other aspects of the unfolding scandal, as well. He said  Marie L. Yovanovitch, whom Mr. Trump abruptly removed as ambassador to Ukraine in May amid a smear campaign against her by the president\u2019s allies, was  \u201can excellent diplomat\u201d whose departure he \u201cregretted.\u201d \u201cI was never a part of any campaign to disparage or dislodge her,\u201d he said. Likewise, Mr. Sondland said it was only because he deeply respected Mr. Taylor, a career diplomat who replaced Ms. Yovanovitch in Ukraine, that he tried to assuage his concerns that nothing untoward was being done with respect to the frozen security aid. In previously released text messages among Mr. Sondland, Mr. Volker and Mr. Taylor, Mr. Taylor was deeply uneasy about what he saw as an effort by Trump aides to use the package of security assistance as leverage over Ukraine for political favors, calling the notion \u201ccrazy.\u201d After calling Mr. Trump directly, Mr. Sondland replied to Mr. Taylor that \u201cThe President has been crystal clear: no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind\u201d and directed Mr. Taylor to stop texting and call him with any additional concerns. Mr. Sondland insisted that he was never involved in any potential discussions with the White House about withholding the security aid in exchange for a pledge to investigate. He said Mr. Trump was in a bad mood when he called him to ask about it, and told Mr. Sondland that he wanted \u201cnothing\u201d from the Ukrainians. On Thursday, Mr. Mulvaney at first confirmed, but later flatly denied, that the aid was held back until Ukraine agreed to investigations Mr. Trump wanted. Mr. Sondland told the committees that he did not know the substance of a July 25 phone call in which Mr. Trump pressed Mr. Zelensky to investigate Mr. Biden and matters related to the 2016 campaign until a reconstructed account of the call was released publicly in September. He said he spoke with Mr. Trump a day after the call, before Mr. Sondland was to meet with Ukrainian leaders in Kiev, but that the conversation was not \u201csubstantive.\u201d",

      "author": "Shane Goldmacher",
      "content": " Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s presidential campaign has sharply scaled back his online advertising, cutting spending so severely since August that he is now investing only a fraction of what his top rivals are on Facebook and Google, the two dominant internet platforms. In a race where many voters are following politics on their smartphones, Mr. Biden\u2019s pullback is an unusual and potentially worrisome sign about his appeal among the Democratic activists, young people and donors who are especially engaged on social media. Candidates rarely withdraw so much money from their online campaigns unless they are seeing weak results in online fund-raising, according to interviews with digital strategists. Mr. Biden and other candidates will start announcing fund-raising results as early as Tuesday morning for the third quarter of 2019; he came in second for the last quarter, behind Pete Buttigieg, pulling in online money early but mostly relying on big donors. More recently, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and other top rivals have outspent Mr. Biden online: He was only the sixth-biggest Democratic spender on Facebook ads in the seven days ending Saturday, even as he began spending more money on digital ads targeting President Trump, Ukraine and impeachment. Instead, he has shifted his spending priorities toward traditional tactics like buying television ads in Iowa. But that strategy has not paid dividends so far: Ms. Warren, a leading rival for the 2020 nomination, recently surpassed him in a key Iowa poll. Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign strategy has been driven, from the start, by the political assumption that the Democratic electorate is more moderate than the progressives who are often loudest online, and he has built his candidacy around appealing to older and more centrist voters. But strategists say Mr. Biden\u2019s online pullback is risky if he hopes to engage and build support among a broader cross-section of Democrats that is almost certainly necessary to win the nomination. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that there\u2019s something in the numbers that\u2019s directing them to go in that direction, and the likeliest explanation is that the rate of return just wasn\u2019t there for Facebook and Google,\u201d said Tim Lim, a veteran Democratic digital strategist unaligned in 2020. \u201cWhich is very, very unusual.\u201d Zac Moffatt, a Republican strategist who led digital operations for Mitt Romney\u2019s presidential run, said abandoning a medium used heavily by so many \u201creeks of desperation.\u201d \u201cYou are spending at least a third to half your life on your mobile phone, and they\u2019re deciding they don\u2019t need to have a message for you there,\u201d Mr. Moffatt said. Online spending serves two purposes: Promoting the candidates\u2019 messages and raising money. The Biden campaign said it was committed to an ongoing digital plan, with a seven-figure digital ad buy planned in the fourth quarter of 2019. But if Mr. Biden struggles to collect small donations online, he will have to depend more on traditional donors and bundlers while his two leading rivals, Ms. Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, emphasize their grass-roots support. The decline of Mr. Biden\u2019s online spending has been precipitous. He entered the race in April as one of the contest\u2019s biggest digital advertisers, spending $1.2 million on Facebook and Google in his first two weeks. Now he is toward the back of the pack. During a 30-day stretch leading up to the September debate, Mr. Biden, who has regularly led the field in national polls, ranked 16th among the Democratic presidential candidates for advertising on Facebook, spending only $32,000 \u2014 placing the former vice president behind two candidates who dropped out during that period and five who did not make the debate stage. And on Google, his spending plunged to $300 during one week in August \u2014 less than one-thousandth of what he spent in his first week as a candidate, when campaigns often spend the most. Ms. Warren spent $66,000 that same week. The Biden campaign cast its diminishing digital footprint as part of a broader strategy. \u201cOur campaign invested a robust digital spend early on to build out supporter lists, outspending all other campaigns from our launch through most of the summer,\u201d said T.J. Ducklo, a spokesman for Mr. Biden. \u201cBy strategically front-loading our investment, we were able to rapidly expand our reach early, instead of meting out our spend over a longer period of time.\u201d Mr. Biden\u2019s digital spending has ticked up in recent days, as he bought a slate of Facebook ads related to Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to have Ukraine investigate the Biden family (\u201cStand with Joe,\u201d some ads say). The exploding story line about foreign interference and impeachment has been good for Mr. Biden\u2019s bottom line: A campaign official said the past week was Mr. Biden\u2019s best for fund-raising since the second week of his campaign. While Mr. Biden\u2019s Facebook ads, like his stump speech, have focused heavily on Mr. Trump, records show he has also tested messages on health care, Medicare, the Supreme Court and guns. The Biden campaign noted that it was still investing in other online platforms that make less advertising data available to the public, such as Spotify, Amazon and Hulu.  Mr. Biden began his campaign with a show of strength, raising $6.3 million in the first 24 hours from nearly 100,000 people. He began with a key advantage: Formerly President Barack Obama\u2019s running mate, he had access to the old email list from the Obama campaigns. Daily fund-raising data through June shows that Mr. Biden\u2019s first days were his strongest for attracting online donations. But in the last six weeks for which data is available, Mr. Biden spent a meager $20,900 on Google, a platform that includes both the internet\u2019s dominant search engine and YouTube. In that same six-week span, Ms. Warren spent more than 25 times as much: $553,700. \u201cIt is not a good sign for his campaign,\u201d said Marne Pike, the chief executive of a Democratic digital strategy firm not affiliated with any 2020 candidate. \u201cI would have a very hard time imagining no one was searching for Joe Biden and clicking on the ads.\u201d It was a similar story on Facebook. There, Mr. Buttigieg has been the top spender, outpacing Mr. Biden in the last 30 days by a ratio of about 12 to 1. Mr. Biden is being outspent by candidates who, like him, are household names with big campaign budgets (like Mr. Sanders, by more than 7 to 1 in the last 30 days), and also by lesser-known figures (the former housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, who has struggled to raise money, by more than 2 to 1). As Mr. Biden has withdrawn from Facebook and Google, he has bought up more than $700,000 in television ads in recent weeks in Iowa. Despite those ads, Ms. Warren recently edged ahead of him in the closely monitored Des Moines Register poll of likely Iowa caucusgoers. Mr. Ducklo, the Biden spokesman, said small contributions \u201chave been essential to getting our campaign message in front of voters: funding our television ads in Iowa and rapidly expanding the field operations in the early states that is knocking doors and making calls.\u201d Andrew Bleeker, president of the Democratic digital firm Bully Pulpit Interactive, said that Mr. Biden\u2019s more moderate position in the Democratic primary could make it harder to raise money online. \u201cFrom a brand perspective, he can\u2019t be that incendiary and that\u2019s what\u2019s rewarded online,\u201d he said. Keegan Goudiss, who served as Mr. Sanders\u2019s director of digital advertising in 2016 but is unaligned in 2020, agreed: \u201cJoe Biden hasn\u2019t thrown the kind of red meat he needs to throw to do well online.\u201d Mr. Biden has also wrapped his candidacy in an aura of inevitability, which does not allow him to sound the alarm to supporters, a tactic that can juice online giving. (Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, for instance, recently scored his biggest day for online donations when he said he would quit the 2020 race if he failed to raise $1.7 million by the end of this month.) One startling measure of Mr. Biden\u2019s diminished online fund-raising ambition is the goal his campaign announced for the last days of September: raising $500,000. By contrast, Mr. Buttigieg set out to raise $1.5 million online, Senator Kamala Harris of California $1 million, former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas $750,000 and the businessman Andrew Yang $1.5 million. At this juncture in the election cycle \u2014 with the first primary votes still more than four months away \u2014 most campaigns with spare money are still spending heavily online for what they call \u201cacquisition\u201d: convincing people to give their email addresses through petition drives, online surveys and the like. Those people are then wooed to become donors. But for Mr. Biden, an analysis of both the content and geographic distribution of his ads suggests he had mostly abandoned trying to acquire new online donors in the last month \u2014 at least until the recent Ukraine controversy. The Biden campaign said it had put $40,000 into ads over two days last week, more than it spent on Facebook during that recent 30-day stretch. The ads that Mr. Biden has been running target an older electorate than that of his top rivals, according to demographic data collected by Bully Pulpit. An overwhelming share of his spending on Facebook \u2014 84 percent \u2014 has targeted voters who are 45 or older. Compare that to Mr. Sanders, who recently touted that the most common age among his donors is 29. Only one-third of his Facebook ad budget has targeted those above 45.",

      "content": "  WESTERVILLE, Ohio \u2014 Hunter Biden, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s son, said in an interview released on Tuesday that he probably would not have been named to the board of a foreign company if his last name weren\u2019t Biden and acknowledged \u201cpoor judgment,\u201d but he rejected suggestions by President Trump that he and his father had engaged in wrongdoing. \u201cDid I make a mistake? Well maybe in the grand scheme of things, yeah,\u201d Mr. Biden said in an interview with ABC News. \u201cBut did I make a mistake based upon some ethical lapse? Absolutely not.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think that there\u2019s a lot of things that would have happened in my life if my last name wasn\u2019t Biden,\u201d he said. The interview comes two days after Hunter Biden pledged that he would not work for foreign-owned companies if his father became president, and just hours before the CNN/New York Times Democratic debate held here in central Ohio, an appearance that is critical to his father\u2019s presidential hopes. His sudden public comments signal the level of concern among Joseph Biden\u2019s allies that the overseas dealings of the younger Mr. Biden had become a potentially damaging liability to his father\u2019s campaign, and are the latest in a flurry of actions pro-Biden forces have taken to mitigate the issue this week ahead of the debate. Mr. Trump has seized on Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings in Ukraine and China to initiate a series of unfounded attacks against the former vice president, a leading Democratic presidential candidate, over the past month. Mr. Trump also asked the government of Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, helping to trigger an impeachment inquiry that Mr. Trump now faces in the House. There is no evidence that the elder Mr. Biden, while serving as vice president, improperly intervened to aid his son, but that has not stopped Mr. Trump and other Republicans from raising questions about possible conflicts of interest even as Mr. Biden has fiercely defended his son\u2019s integrity, and his own, over the last week. Hunter Biden, who recently said he would resign from the board of a Chinese investment company, acknowledged his work abroad has become a \u201cdistraction, because I have to sit here and answer these questions. And so that\u2019s why I have committed that I won\u2019t serve on any boards or I won\u2019t work directly for any foreign entities when my dad becomes president.\u201d Mr. Biden, 49, said he had exercised \u201cpoor judgment\u201d by getting involved in a situation that he compared to a \u201cswamp.\u201d But he blamed his father\u2019s opponents, including Mr. Trump, for spreading a \u201cridiculous conspiracy idea\u201d involving his work, and repeatedly insisted that he did not discuss his business decisions with his father. \u201cI gave a hook to some very unethical people to act in illegal ways to try to do some harm to my father,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s where I made the mistake. So I take full responsibility for that. Did I do anything improper? No, not in any way. Not in any way whatsoever.\u201d Many Democratic strategists and officials have warned that the scrutiny on the Biden family has become a significant distraction for the former vice president, and poses perhaps the greatest threat yet to a candidacy that until recent weeks was well ahead in the polls. That makes it all the more urgent for Mr. Biden to land the kind of consistently fluent, forceful debate performance that has so far eluded him at a moment when Senator Elizabeth Warren has now surpassed him in some polls, Democratic operatives and activists said. \u201cI\u2019m never a distraction to my dad, but as it relates to actually going and being onstage with him \u2014 this is not a family business,\u201d Hunter Biden said Tuesday in the ABC interview, which aired on \u201cGood Morning America\u2019\u2019 and was also excerpted online by the network. \u201cEverybody kind of thinks that somehow, whether it\u2019s a compliment that we\u2019re like the Kennedys or whether it\u2019s a, you know, backhanded compliment like you\u2019re the Trumps, my dad has a, a job, but that does not mean that I have had any plans to go do rallies and, you know and, you know, talk about Donald Trump\u2019s kids and I never will, you know, that\u2019s not what Bidens do.\u201d At a news conference on Sunday, however, his father did appear to take some oblique swipes at the ethical practices of members of the Trump family, some of whom who have conducted their own overseas business dealings. And Hunter Biden seemed to be dismissive of Donald Trump Jr., who along with his father and brother have been highly critical of the Bidens. \u201cDonald Prince Humperdinck, um, Trump, Jr., is not somebody I really care about,\u201d he said, an apparent reference to a character in the movie \u201cThe Princess Bride.\u201d In the interview, Hunter Biden signaled that by backing away from foreign dealings, he hoped to eliminate the controversy as a campaign issue for his father. \u201cI\u2019m taking it off the table,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m making that commitment. Let\u2019s see if anybody else makes that commitment. But that\u2019s the commitment that I\u2019m making.\u201d A lawyer for Hunter Biden said Sunday in a statement that he planned to leave the board of the Chinese private equity company by the end of October, and that if the elder Mr. Biden were elected president, Hunter Biden would \u201cagree not to serve on boards of, or work on behalf of, foreign-owned companies.\u201d Hunter Biden had previously served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company, Burisma Holdings, including during a time when his father was running American policy in that country, but he stepped down in April, the same month that the elder Mr. Biden announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination. While the elder Mr. Biden said he learned of the Sunday statement from his son\u2019s lawyers, his campaign is taking steps to address the potential damage from Mr. Trump\u2019s unfounded claims of corruption by the Bidens. On Monday morning, Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign released a plan centered on promoting ethics in government. His campaign and his allies have said that Mr. Biden would both push back forcefully against Mr. Trump and continue to discuss policy matters, like health care, on the debate stage and on the campaign trail. The Biden family has faced significant tragedy over the decades: Mr. Biden\u2019s first wife and a baby daughter were killed in a car crash in 1972 that injured Hunter Biden and his brother, Beau. In 2015, Beau Biden died from brain cancer, influencing his father\u2019s decision not to seek the presidency that year. Hunter Biden has also struggled with addiction. Asked if he was concerned that the \u201cnoise\u201d associated with Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks could affect his sobriety, he replied, \u201cof course.\u201d \u201cLook, you don\u2019t want to live in the worry of it,\u2019\u2019 he added. \u201cBecause then you\u2019re feeding the beast. I have no answer other than this: You\u2019ve got to live in the connections that you have to healthy things. And I have so many of them. And I\u2019ve got to live there instead of living in fear like, \u2018Oh my God, the stress is going to make me drink, or the stress is going to make me use.\u2019\u201d He also grew emotional when discussing the presidency. \u201cI take no pleasure in this, watching, watching, this, this death spiral of this, this administration, this president, and the people that surround him,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope that, that the history isn\u2019t fully written yet.\u201d Katie Glueck reported from Westerville, Ohio, and Stephanie Saul from New York.",

      "content": "  COLUMBUS, Ohio \u2014 For months, the Democratic presidential race has seemed to move inexorably toward a confrontation between former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. As Ms. Warren gathered financial support and strength in the polls, Mr. Biden steadily slid on both fronts while the rest of the Democratic field stagnated with voters. A jumbled primary appeared on the verge of becoming a contest between two front-runners. But the debate in central Ohio on Tuesday night showed that the rest of the Democratic pack was not ready to yield. From the moderate wing of the party, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota are now confronting Ms. Warren directly on her policy views and challenging Mr. Biden implicitly for his status as the party\u2019s dominant centrist. From the left, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has returned to the race with force after a heart attack that shook his candidacy, collecting valuable endorsements from prominent left-wing women in Congress, including Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Klobuchar, in assailing Ms. Warren by name, and Mr. Sanders, in rolling out endorsements from the most coveted figures in progressive politics, are acknowledging the same urgency about halting the drift toward a two-person primary. But that task could be easier because of what may ultimately prove to be this week\u2019s most consequential development: Mr. Biden, who raised $6.3 million on the day he entered the race in April, revealed Tuesday that he has run through so much money that he has less than $9 million left. That is far less than what the two leading liberals in the race, Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren, as well as Mr. Buttigieg, have on hand. Mr. Biden insisted on Wednesday that he was \u201cconfident\u201d in his financial position and was not contemplating any changes to his campaign because of money. But between Mr. Biden\u2019s apparent weakness, the sudden onslaught against Ms. Warren and signs of new relevance from Mr. Sanders, there is now at least enough uncertainty in the race to encourage even long-shot candidates to persist. \u201cPeople have been saying the race was going to solidify into Biden-versus-Warren,\u201d said Paul Begala, a longtime Democratic strategist. \u201cI think instead it has become more fluid than ever.\u201d Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, who is backing Ms. Klobuchar, said in an interview Wednesday he believed there was still plenty of room to make headway in the Democratic race, because many voters were only now \u201creally listening and tuning in.\u201d \u201cIt felt like the moment is here,\u201d Mr. Walz said of the debate. Without criticizing other candidates by name, Mr. Walz predicted Ms. Klobuchar would appeal to \u201ca broader swath of folks\u201d beyond activists on the left, and also to voters\u2019 \u201chunger to get back to a decency and a normalcy\u201d \u2014 political currents Mr. Biden has sought to tap into, with mixed success. Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren, of course, continue to loom over their rivals and it is unlikely that the debate will prompt an immediate change in fortunes for either candidate. On Wednesday, Mr. Biden attempted to reassert himself by taking on Ms. Warren in more caustic terms at an event in Ohio. He called it \u201cabsolutely ridiculous\u201d that Ms. Warren had not been clearer about how she would pay for a \u201cMedicare for all\u201d system and challenged her to be \u201ccandid and honest\u201d about it. At the moment, Ms. Warren appears to have an upper hand in most of the early-voting states, along with a powerful campaign war chest stocked with a reservoir of online donors, while Mr. Biden still holds a slight lead in national polls and the conviction among many older Democrats that he would be the safest nominee to challenge President Trump. Yet both Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren have vulnerabilities that their underdog opponents are now determined to exploit: his poll numbers have dropped steadily since the start of the summer and his campaign is in the midst of a financial crunch. And Ms. Warren must still allay Democratic concerns about her strength as a general-election candidate and strike a delicate balance between locking down liberal voters who also like Mr. Sanders while growing her support among moderates and racial minorities. Aaron Pickrell, an Ohio-based Democratic strategist, said the debate had shown that \u201cother candidates getting into the top tier is not insurmountable.\u201d Both Ms. Klobuchar and Mr. Buttigieg, he said, had begun to break through with a message of Midwestern pragmatism that could appeal to voters in the early states. \u201cThey\u2019re setting themselves up as a potential alternative for Biden,\u201d Mr. Pickrell said. \u201cYou can see these folks breaking through when we get to Iowa.\u201d Surveys there indicate that about half the Democrats planning to participate in the caucuses are moderate or conservative; many of these voters have said they are uncommitted or are supporting Mr. Biden but willing to change their minds. Some candidates have more maneuvering room than others to challenge the two leaders: Whereas Mr. Buttigieg and Mr. Sanders are flush with cash, Ms. Klobuchar is in a far more tenuous financial position and has yet to qualify for the debate in November. At least a few other candidates who took an assertive approach Tuesday are in similar straits, straining to raise money or meet the debate threshold or both. What could prove decisive in Iowa, and beyond, is if centrist voters coalesce behind a single candidate or fracture among the group of hopefuls presenting themselves as pragmatists. If Mr. Biden cannot recover a measure of momentum, but holds on to enough support to block other candidates from building a coalition of more moderate Democrats, it could allow Ms. Warren or Mr. Sanders to roll through the earliest primaries and caucuses with relatively weak opposition. This scenario, of a sort of zombie Biden candidacy, is what most alarms supporters of other center-left Democrats in the race. Mayor Nan Whaley of Dayton, Ohio, a close ally of Mr. Buttigieg, predicted the South Bend mayor would now \u201cdig down deep in Iowa and New Hampshire,\u201d carrying his message from the debate \u2014 a combination of uplifting rhetoric about the future and blunt criticism of certain progressive policies \u2014 into the early states where he\u2019s polling in fourth place. Ms. Whaley said she expected Mr. Buttigieg, 37, to make a determined effort to displace Mr. Biden as the candidate seen as most capable of speaking to Midwesterners. \u201cWhat you have with Pete is, you have somebody who speaks so amazingly well to this part of the country and is incredibly electable,\u201d Ms. Whaley said, adding, \u201cWhat Biden does is, he tells you all he\u2019s done for us, which really hasn\u2019t been enough because we\u2019ve had 30 years of failed policy in the Midwest.\u201d But it is not Mr. Buttigieg who is depending on millennials to claim the nomination \u2014 it\u2019s the oldest candidate in the race, the 78-year-old Mr. Sanders. And that is why his endorsements from Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota \u2014 and an expected one from Rashida Tlaib of Michigan \u2014 could prove so vital to at least sustaining his campaign. Their appeal with younger progressives offers Mr. Sanders a vote of confidence he can trumpet to the voting bloc that makes up his strongest constituency. That cue has particular resonance in this moment, when even some of the senator\u2019s supporters have been wondering about his prospects following his hospitalization and acknowledgment that he may have to slow down the pace of his campaign. \u201cTheir endorsement is huge in validating him as a face for the party and movement going forward,\u201d said Representative Ro Khanna of California, a co-chair of Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign. Mr. Khanna said the backing from three women of color would help Mr. Sanders in another crucial way at a time when Democrats are moving left on racial issues \u2014 by rebutting the criticism that his is a niche campaign for white, left-wing men. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say we\u2019re just Bernie Bros when you have the most visible progressives from communities of color coming out and saying, \u2018We\u2019re for Bernie Sanders,\u2019\u201d Mr. Khanna argued. \u201cThat\u2019s more powerful than what Bernie Sanders or any of his co-chairs can say about his polling or support.\u201d The question now, for Mr. Sanders and the other well-funded contenders, is how they begin spending their money. With the race moving into the fall and the candidates needing ways to get attention amid saturation of coverage with the impeachment inquiry, many Democrats expect the attacks on the debate stage to begin playing out on the airwaves. Even more than the verbal fisticuffs and flashy endorsements, it was Mr. Biden\u2019s comparably weak financial standing that prompted many Democrats to think a new phase may be at hand. \u201cThat went off like a bomb this morning,\u201d said Mr. Begala, noting that his phone was \u201cblowing up with texts\u201d about the putative front-runner\u2019s money struggles. Mr. Biden\u2019s problem could be even more dire than it appears, Mr. Begala said. That\u2019s because he is so reliant on raising money from wealthy donors, who are often fickle and want to pick a winner, while those who outraised him can keep bringing in contributions online without devoting so much time and money to finance events.",

      "author": "Nick Corasaniti",
      "content": " [Watch the full video of the debate here.] Joseph R. Biden Jr. pushed back against President Trump\u2019s attack on his son\u2019s business dealings, saying that the attention should instead be on Mr. Trump\u2019s actions of inviting a foreign power into the election and not on the controversy sparked by unfounded conspiracies about the overseas business dealings of his son Hunter. But the former vice president at first did not address part of a question at the Democratic presidential debate from Anderson Cooper, who asked whether it was appropriate for his son to have business dealings in Ukraine while Mr. Biden was vice president. Mr. Biden instead pivoted to Mr. Trump, and invoked the founding fathers. \u201cMy son did nothing wrong,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cI did nothing wrong.\u201d He continued: When pressed by Mr. Cooper in a follow-up question on whether his son should have had foreign business dealings during the Obama administration, Mr. Biden again said they had done nothing wrong. \u201cI did my job,\u201d he said. \u201cI never discussed a single thing with my son about anything having to do with Ukraine. No one has indicated I have. We\u2019ve always kept everything separate, even when my son was the attorney general of the state of Delaware. We never discussed anything. There would be no potential conflict.\u201d Over the past week, the Biden campaign and allies have taken numerous steps to mitigate any distraction posed by the younger Biden\u2019s business dealings in Ukraine and China. On Sunday, Hunter Biden announced through his lawyer that he intended to step down from the board of a Chinese company, BHR, by the end of the month. His lawyer also said that should the elder Mr. Biden be elected president, Hunter Biden would \u201cagree not to serve on boards of, or work on behalf of, foreign-owned companies.\u201d In an interview with ABC News on Tuesday morning, Hunter Biden denied any wrongdoing, saying his only mistake was creating a situation for President Trump and his allies to attempt to exploit. \u201cI gave a hook to some very unethical people to act in illegal ways to try to do some harm to my father,\u201d he said in the interview. \u201cThat\u2019s where I made the mistake. So I take full responsibility for that. Did I do anything improper? No, not in any way. Not in any way whatsoever.\u201d The elder Mr. Biden, in a brief news conference on Sunday after his son\u2019s announcement that he would step down from the BHR board, echoed those sentiments, contending repeatedly that \u201cno one has asserted my son did a single thing wrong\u201d and accusing the president of sowing misinformation. \u201cNo one,\u201d he said, \u201chas asserted that I have done anything wrong except the lying president. That\u2019s the only thing. That\u2019s the focus.\u201d The former vice president added that he learned of his son\u2019s decision through the public announcement and that he never consulted with his son. He said his son\u2019s choice \u201crepresents the kind of man of integrity he is.\u201d For weeks, Mr. Trump and his allies have attacked Hunter Biden\u2019s business entanglements in Ukraine and China while his father was vice president, with unfounded and baseless accusations that the elder Mr. Biden used his office to help his son. There is no evidence to support their claims. Mr. Trump and his personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, have asked Ukraine\u2019s government to investigate the Bidens, including in a conversation between Mr. Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. The effort helped to trigger an impeachment inquiry in the House. ",

      "author": "Maggie Astor",
      "content": "  We here on The New York Times Politics desk had a busy and exciting week helping to host the fourth Democratic debate. Tuesday night was especially frenetic, with the debate, third-quarter fund-raising reports and a pair of major endorsements all in the news. As always, we\u2019re here to step back and sort it all out for you. Here\u2019s a rundown of the major moments of the week. Thanks to her newfound front-runner status, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts was everyone\u2019s target on Tuesday night. She fielded criticism on her proposed wealth tax, on the cost of \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d and on her decision not to urge Twitter to suspend President Trump\u2019s account. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, appearing at his first event since his heart attack two weeks earlier, seemed like his old self and aimed to dispel some of the concerns about his health. And Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota had big nights, sparring with Ms. Warren and setting themselves up as moderate voters\u2019 alternatives to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr, who largely faded into the background. Tuesday was the deadline for candidates to file their third-quarter reports with the Federal Election Commission. Our colleagues compiled the fund-raising totals, analyzed how they compared to previous quarters, and created a graphic that shows who\u2019s up and who\u2019s down in the money race. The candidates also provided a few surprising top lines: Mr. Biden is relatively low on cash; about half the field spent more money in the third quarter than they took in; and Tom Steyer, a billionaire former hedge fund manager who is largely self-financing his campaign, spent $47 million in the past months. But the real oddity was on the other end of the spectrum. Mayor Wayne Messam of Miramar, Fla., reported raising a grand total of five (5) dollars from July through September. As the three-hour debate was winding down on Tuesday, word came that Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a progressive political star from New York, was planning to endorse Mr. Sanders at a rally this weekend. Representative Ilhan Omar, a Minnesota Democrat, soon gave her support to Mr. Sanders, too, scoring him a highly coveted endorsement two weeks after his heart attack. Both women are among the first-term Democratic women of color known as \u201cthe squad.\u201d The other two members of the group, Representatives Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ayanna S. Pressley of Massachusetts, have not made a presidential endorsement. In a speech on Thursday at Georgetown University, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, argued forcefully against the idea that the social network should be an arbiter of speech, doubling down on a stance that has drawn wide condemnation as the company continues to face accusations of amplifying disinformation. Ms. Warren renewed that criticism after Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s speech, saying late Thursday in a tweet: \u201cFacebook is actively helping Trump spread lies and misinformation. Facebook already helped elect Donald Trump once. They might do it again \u2014 and profit off of it.\u201d The comments continued an increasingly public feud between Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Warren. Earlier this month, Ms. Warren bought a political ad on Facebook that purposefully included the false claim that Mr. Zuckerberg and Facebook backed Mr. Trump\u2019s re-election \u2014 and essentially dared the social network to remove it. (Neither Mr. Zuckerberg nor Facebook has endorsed a candidate.) Mr. Zuckerberg at one point invoked the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to make his point about free speech, which drew a response from one of Dr. King\u2019s daughters, Bernice King. \u201cI\u2019d like to help Facebook better understand the challenges #MLK faced from disinformation campaigns launched by politicians,\u201d she wrote on Twitter. \u201cThese campaigns created an atmosphere for his assassination.\u201d On Tuesday, Ms. Warren also announced that she would not take any contributions over $200 from executives at big tech companies, big banks, private equity firms or hedge funds. Several Democrats released policy proposals this week, many of which echoed ideas from their rivals. We leave you with this photo of Mr. Steyer and his tie. Your humble hosts are not experts in neckwear, but lucky for you, Vanessa Friedman \u2014 The Times\u2019s fashion director and chief fashion critic \u2014 actually is. She has written a piece containing everything you ever wanted to know about the tie, its Twitter account(s), Mr. Steyer\u2019s penchant for tartan and, well, you get the idea. This is a rabbit hole. We welcome you down it.",

      "author": "Glenn Thrush",
      "content": " RENO, Nev. \u2014 Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Wednesday night delivered his most forceful response yet to President Trump\u2019s attacks on him and his son, accusing the Trump team of waging a campaign of \u201clies, smears, distortions and name calling\u201d geared at knocking him out of the presidential race. Mr. Biden made his comments during a campaign swing through Nevada after days of internal debate among his advisers over how best to refute unsubstantiated claims by the president and his personal lawyer that Mr. Biden improperly assisted his son\u2019s business ventures in Ukraine and China. The counterattack, people close to Mr. Biden said, was intended to demonstrate what he had been promising supporters for the past week: that he would not let Mr. Trump \u201chijack\u201d his campaign by allowing the president\u2019s narrative to take root. It was also intended to prove, in a walk-and-chew-gum kind of way, that he could multitask even when facing withering political fire \u2014 unveiling a serious policy proposal on guns early Wednesday in Las Vegas, then pivoting to a sharp political attack by nightfall in the north. In the speech, the former vice president said the attacks on his family were intended to divert attention from the widening impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump\u2019s attempts to pressure Ukraine to investigate the Bidens \u2014 and he cited them as proof that the White House feared him more than any other Democratic presidential contender. \u201cLet me make something clear to Trump and his hatchet men and the special interests funding his attacks against me: I\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d Mr. Biden told a crowd of about 500 at the Truckee Meadows Community College here. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to destroy me,\u201d he said to cheers from supporters, a handful wearing \u201cImpeach 45\u201d jerseys. \u201cAnd you\u2019re not going to destroy my family. I don\u2019t care how much money you spend or how dirty the attacks get.\u201d The American people, Mr. Biden said, \u201cknow me and they know him. The idea of Donald Trump attacking anyone\u2019s credibility is a joke.\u201d Earlier in the day, speaking at a gun safety forum in Las Vegas, Mr. Biden blasted the president and his personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, who had communicated with Ukrainian officials on Mr. Trump\u2019s behalf. He said there was \u201czero, zero, zero\u201d evidence that his family had done anything wrong. Mr. Biden\u2019s increasingly bitter fight with Mr. Trump comes at a potential tipping point in the 2020 Democratic presidential race. Until recently, Mr. Biden had been leading in most national polls since he entered the field last spring. But Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, fueled by a highly disciplined campaign, has surged in many early-voting states. A Monmouth University national poll released Wednesday showed Mr. Biden locked in a statistical dead heat with Ms. Warren, who garnered 28 percent support from Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters to his 25 percent, a difference within the survey\u2019s margin of error. At Wednesday night\u2019s rally, Mr. Biden took a swipe at some of his Democratic opponents who had accused him of focusing too much on Mr. Trump and not enough on issues facing voters. \u201cA lot of my opponents say we have to do more than just beat Donald Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cI agree. We have to do more than beat Donald Trump. We have to beat him like a drum.\u201d Mr. Biden\u2019s team has been alarmed by reports that Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters plan to launch an aggressive advertising campaign to portray the former vice president as the person who had acted improperly \u2014 despite the lack of any evidence to support that claim. And Mr. Biden\u2019s top advisers have been equally incensed by what they view as the news media\u2019s willingness to air unsupported allegations by Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani. The president and his lawyer have alleged that Mr. Biden, as vice president, pressured the Ukrainians to force out a top prosecutor in order to derail an inquiry into a Ukrainian company that had paid his son, Hunter Biden. But Mr. Biden said Wednesday that he had been enforcing the demands of the Obama administration and other Western nations by seeking to replace the prosecutor with an official more committed to fighting corruption. On Sunday, Anita Dunn and Kate Bedingfield, two senior Biden strategists, wrote to several major television networks asking them to stop booking Mr. Giuliani on their news programs, accusing him of spreading \u201cdebunked conspiracy theories.\u201d Mr. Biden amplified that argument on Wednesday, urging reporters to regard Mr. Trump\u2019s statements, and his tweets, as not simply fodder for controversy but as a dangerous \u201cabuse of power\u201d that included enlisting foreign leaders as allies in his re-election effort. Mr. Trump, he said, is \u201cafraid of just how badly I would beat him next November.\u201d The president, in his own remarks on Wednesday, did not agree. \u201cI\u2019d rather run against Biden than almost any of those candidates,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House.",

Why Political Influence in Foreign Policy MattersReaders have asked The New York Times why asking another nation for help ahead of an election is such a serious issue. Here are some answers.By Katie RogersPRINT EDITIONInfluence Matters In Foreign Policy|October 22, 2019, Page A16",
      "author": "Katie Rogers",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 A July 25 call between President Trump and the president of Ukraine is the basis for an impeachment inquiry into whether Mr. Trump withheld American military aid until Ukrainian officials investigated former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son, Hunter. Last week the acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, effectively acknowledged the quid pro quo, although he said the aid was in part contingent on Ukraine\u2019s investigating Mr. Trump\u2019s widely debunked theory that Ukraine, not Russia, was responsible for hacking Democratic Party emails in 2016. The theory is politically helpful to Mr. Trump because it would show he was elected president without that Russian help. Mr. Mulvaney was unapologetic in his remarks. \u201cI have news for everybody: Get over it,\u201d Mr. Mulvaney told reporters at the White House. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be political influence in foreign policy.\u201d (He later reversed himself and has said his comments were misconstrued.) Readers have asked The New York Times to explain why, exactly, another nation\u2019s interference in the democratic process is such a serious issue. Here are some answers. Other countries have their own interests, and those interests don\u2019t always match ours, said Trevor Potter, the founder of the Campaign Legal Center, a nonpartisan group that works to ensure fair elections. \u201cMany countries are rivals of ours and of our democratic system,\u201d Mr. Potter said. He listed as two chief examples China and Russia, countries that Mr. Trump has publicly suggested could help him achieve his political aims. \u201cIn some cases, they\u2019re going to want policies that help them and therefore hurt us. In other cases, though, they just want us to fail.\u201d Trump administration officials \u2014 but not the president himself \u2014 have publicly and repeatedly warned foreign governments not to meddle in American elections. Yes. The ability of a foreign nation to gain access and influence over America\u2019s democratic process has been a concern since the early days of the republic. During the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia in the summer of 1787, delegates debated what kind of behavior should merit a president\u2019s removal from office. George Mason suggested the standard of \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors,\u201d which holds to this day. One of the high crimes the framers had in mind was accepting money from a foreign power, or what Alexander Hamilton said was giving in to \u201cthe desire in foreign powers to gain an improper ascendant in our councils.\u201d In short, the authors of the Constitution saw few bigger threats than a president corruptly tied to forces from overseas. Mr. Trump has denied any explicit quid pro quo \u2014 a favor or advantage granted or expected in return for something \u2014 in his call with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky. He has repeatedly referred to it as a \u201cperfect\u201d conversation. But several elements of the call could conceivably have been used as bargaining chips by Mr. Trump. One was the American military aid, which came to nearly $400 million for security assistance to help Ukraine fight Russian aggression on its eastern border. The other was a proposed Oval Office meeting between Mr. Zelensky and Mr. Trump, highly desired by Mr. Zelensky as a powerful show of American support at a time when Ukraine is under threat from Russia. According to a summary of the call released by the White House, Mr. Trump raised two matters after Mr. Zelensky spoke of his need for American help. \u201cI would like you to do us a favor, though,\u201d Mr. Trump said, shifting the conversation to ask Mr. Zelensky to investigate the Bidens as well as the conspiracy theory.  Mr. Zelensky responded that his prosecutor general would look into those issues, and asked Mr. Trump to provide any additional information that could aid in the investigation. At its most basic level, asking another government for help \u2014 whether a quid pro quo existed or not \u2014 means that Mr. Trump would find himself indebted to another country. Doing this in private is especially alarming, Mr. Potter said, because the Trump administration\u2019s decision to even temporarily withhold military aid for a country that needs to arm itself against Russia goes directly against American national security interests. \u201cIf the president of Ukraine has agreed to do this, he has something to hold over the head of the president of the United States,\u201d Mr. Potter said. \u201cIt indeed opens the president up to political blackmail.\u201d Asking a foreigner for aid in an American political campaign is illegal, which Ellen L. Weintraub, the head of the Federal Election Commission, has made clear. \u201cIf a foreign government is investing resources in producing something that will be a value to a campaign here in the United States, that\u2019s a problem,\u201d Ms. Weintraub said in an interview with ABC News. No. Both Republican and Democratic presidential administrations have resisted the idea of enlisting help from foreign powers for political advantage. In 1992, when President George Bush was behind in the polls in his re-election campaign against Bill Clinton, a group of Republican lawmakers suggested to White House officials that they ask the British and Russian governments to dig up unflattering information on Mr. Clinton\u2019s actions protesting the Vietnam War during his time in London, and to look into a visit he made to Moscow. \u201cThey wanted us to contact the Russians or the British to seek information on Bill Clinton\u2019s trip to Moscow,\u201d James A. Baker III, Mr. Bush\u2019s chief of staff, wrote in a memo at the time. \u201cI said we absolutely could not do that.\u201d Ten former chiefs of staff for five former presidents \u2014 Ronald Reagan, both Bushes, Mr. Clinton and Barack Obama \u2014 have all said they would have considered such a prospect unacceptable. But that doesn\u2019t mean the Russians haven\u2019t tried. The Soviet Union offered to help Adlai Stevenson make a third presidential run in 1960, a proposal he turned down. The Soviet ambassador likewise offered to help finance Hubert Humphrey\u2019s campaign in 1968, drawing another rejection. And Leonid Brezhnev told Gerald R. Ford that he would \u201cdo everything we can\u201d to help him win in 1976, a comment Mr. Ford brushed off without taking seriously. Yes. The Central Intelligence Agency helped overthrow elected leaders in Iran and Guatemala in the 1950s and backed violent coups in several other countries in the 1960s. It plotted assassinations and supported brutal anti-Communist governments in Latin America, Africa and Asia. The C.I.A. has planted misinformation and, at times, used cash as a way to achieve foreign policy aims. But experts have argued that modern American efforts are not morally equivalent to those in Russia. In recent decades, American efforts have been geared toward promoting candidates who challenge authoritarian leaders. Russian efforts, on the other hand, are meant to sow discord. \u201cWe often consider ourselves and hold ourselves out as an example of how other countries should conduct themselves,\u201d Mr. Potter said. \u201cWhen we have internal battles or things have gone wrong here, it is much harder to do that.\u201d He added, \u201cCountries can exploit that and say, \u2018We may be bad, but the United States is no better.\u2019\u201d Sort of. The only impeachment involving foreign policy came in the case of a senator, William Blount, who was accused in 1797 of scheming to transfer parts of Florida and the Louisiana Territory to Britain. The House impeached Blount, but he fled Washington. The Senate opted to expel him rather than convict him at trial.",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 A career State Department official told impeachment investigators this week that he raised concerns with a senior White House official in 2015 about the son of then-Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. holding a position on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. But the warning from George P. Kent, then a State Department officer stationed in Kiev, was not acted on, according to two people familiar with Mr. Kent\u2019s testimony. Mr. Kent, now of the State Department\u2019s Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs, said he told the official that Hunter Biden\u2019s position could look like a conflict of interest, given his father\u2019s role, and would complicate American efforts to encourage Ukraine to clean up corruption. The White House official told Mr. Kent that the elder Mr. Biden did not have the \u201cbandwidth\u201d to address the concerns while his older son, Beau, was undergoing cancer treatment, according to the people, who were not authorized to discuss the private deposition. President Trump on Friday latched onto the rare bit of good news for him coming out of the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry. Mr. Kent had also given Democrats plenty of fodder to drive their inquiry forward, but the emergence of any information that could tarnish the Bidens was welcome at the White House, even if White House officials have declared the inquiry illegitimate. \u201cHe excoriated the Obama administration and Joe Biden and Joe Biden\u2019s son, saying that he has tremendous problems, tremendous problems, with Joe Biden\u2019s son and the Ukraine,\u201d Mr. Trump said of Mr. Kent, citing news reports. He added, \u201cIt\u2019s been a big deal.\u201d Mr. Kent\u2019s remarks about the Bidens were first reported by The Washington Post. Mr. Kent also voiced concerns about the Trump administration\u2019s handling of the United States\u2019 relationship with Ukraine, testifying that he and other career officials were all but cut out of decisions regarding the country after a May meeting at the White House. Andrew Wright and Barry Hartman, lawyers for Mr. Kent, declined to discuss the details of his testimony but cautioned against selectively picking out \u201celements of his testimony\u201d that \u201cmight not give the full picture.\u201d Hunter Biden\u2019s work for the Ukrainian firm Burisma Holdings, and an unsubstantiated allegation that his father took official action as vice president to protect the firm from a Ukrainian prosecutor, lie at the center of the impeachment inquiry. Mr. Trump and his private lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, both pressured Ukraine\u2019s leaders to investigate the Bidens, and House lawmakers are examining whether the White House withheld around $400 million in military aid to Ukraine to pressure Kiev to conduct the investigation of the Bidens or other matters of interest to the president. Andrew Bates, a spokesman for Mr. Biden\u2019s presidential campaign, said Mr. Biden stood by his record as vice president. Mr. Biden has denied he took any improper actions in connection to his son\u2019s work. \u201cOn Joe Biden\u2019s watch, the U.S. made eradicating corruption a centerpiece of our policies toward Ukraine, including achieving the removal of an inept prosecutor who shielded wrongdoers from accountability,\u201d he said. It might be useful to Mr. Trump to be able to say his concerns about Hunter Biden\u2019s work were shared by State Department officials during the Obama administration. But pressing that point holds risks. On Friday, Representative Adam Kinzinger, Republican of Illinois, expressed unease that the acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, had, during a televised White House briefing Thursday, indicated a link between the withholding of military assistance and the demand for another investigation related to the Democrats. Before reversing himself, Mr. Mulvaney said that Mr. Trump had withheld the funds in part until Ukraine began an investigation into an unsubstantiated theory that Ukraine, rather than Russia, had interfered in the 2016 presidential election. Mr. Kinzinger told CNN he was not sure what Mr. Mulvaney was saying the president wanted Ukraine to investigate when he told reporters the aid was withheld pending the investigation. But, he said, if it had anything to do with the Bidens, that would be serious, \u201cbecause it would be, if it\u2019s true, taxpayer-funded aid and policy for political reasons, which is totally wrong.\u201d",

      "author": "Jonathan Martin",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 When a half-dozen Democratic donors gathered at the Whitby Hotel in Manhattan last week, the dinner began with a discussion of which presidential candidates the contributors liked. But as conversations among influential Democrats often go these days, the meeting quickly evolved into a discussion of who was not in the race \u2014 but could be lured in. Would Hillary Clinton get in, the contributors wondered, and how about Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York mayor? One person even mused whether Michelle Obama would consider a late entry, according to two people who attended the event, which was hosted by the progressive group American Bridge. It\u2019s that time of the election season for Democrats. \u201cSince the last debate, just anecdotally, I\u2019ve had five or six people ask me: \u2018Is there anybody else?\u2019\u201d said Leah Daughtry, a longtime Democrat who has run two of the party\u2019s recent conventions. With doubts rising about former Vice President Joseph R. Biden\u2019s ability to finance a multistate primary campaign, persistent questions about Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s viability in the general election and skepticism that Mayor Pete Buttigieg, of South Bend, Ind., can broaden his appeal beyond white voters, Democratic leaders are engaging in a familiar rite: fretting about who is in the race and longing for a white knight to enter the contest at the last minute. It is a regular, if not quite quadrennial, tradition for a party that can be fatalistic about its prospects and recalls similar Maalox moments Democrats endured in 1992, 2004 and in the last primary, when it was Mr. Biden who nearly entered the race in October. But the mood of alarm is even more intense because of the party\u2019s hunger to defeat President Trump and \u2014 with just over three months to go before voting starts in Iowa \u2014 their impatience with finding Mr. or Mrs. Right among the current crop of candidates. \u201cThere\u2019s more anxiety than ever,\u201d said Connie Schultz, a journalist who is married to Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, another Democrat who some in the party would like to see join the race. \u201cWe\u2019re both getting the calls. I\u2019ve been surprised by some who\u2019ve called me.\u201d \u201cI can see it, I can feel it, I can hear it,\u201d Mitch Landrieu, the former New Orleans mayor, said of the unease within the party. He said he thinks Mr. Biden is best positioned to defeat Mr. Trump but called the former vice president\u2019s fund-raising \u201ca real concern.\u201d Mr. Biden\u2019s lackluster debate performances and alarmingly low cash flow \u2014 he has less than $9 million on hand, not even half of some of his rivals \u2014 has fueled the Democratic disquiet. But if the causes of the concern are plain to see, what exactly can be done about it is less clear. And even some of those being wooed acknowledge that it can be hard to discern between people just being nice and those who genuinely want them in the race. Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Bloomberg have both told people privately in recent weeks that if they thought they could win, they would consider entering the primary \u2014 but that they were skeptical there would be an opening, according to Democrats who have spoken with them. Former Secretary of State John F. Kerry, who associates say has wondered aloud about whether he should have run and has found it hard to watch Mr. Biden\u2019s missteps, has also been urged to get in. But he still thinks the former vice president, who was once his longtime Senate colleague, is the party\u2019s best nominee. Another Obama administration official who weighed a campaign at the start of the year, former Attorney General Eric Holder, is considering a last-minute entry but has conceded it may be too late, according to a Democrat familiar with his thinking. Mr. Brown, who nearly entered the race earlier this year, said the pressure on him to reconsider from labor leaders, Democratic officials and donors has \u201cbecome more frequent.\u201d And Deval Patrick, the former Massachusetts governor, who also weighed a campaign run before deciding not to, said he too has been nudged by friends to reconsider. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to be rumored about,\u201d he said, before notably refusing to rule out a last-minute entry. \u201cDon\u2019t ask me that question,\u201d he said. But Mr. Patrick suggested an 11th-hour bid was highly unlikely and had a message for increasingly angst-ridden Democrats: \u201cEverybody needs to calm down, it\u2019s early. It\u2019s so early.\u201d The chances that another major contender decides to run are remote: While Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Bloomberg have both been encouraged to enter the race, Democrats close to them believe the only scenario under which they\u2019d consider running is if Mr. Biden drops out or is badly weakened. Neither is likely to take place before the end of this calendar year, at which point the filing deadline to be on the primary ballot in large Super Tuesday states like California and Texas will have passed. But that\u2019s not stopping the speculation, which has only grown of late thanks in part to the 2016 Democratic nominee\u2019s public comments. Mrs. Clinton, after largely staying in the  background of the Democratic primary, has been more vocal this month, promoting a book she wrote with her daughter and taunting Mr. Trump on Twitter. She also opened a feud with Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii by claiming the long-shot candidate was being supported by the Russians, as a potential third-party spoiler in the general election. Democrats who have recently spoken with Mrs. Clinton say she shares the same concerns other party elites have about the field \u2014 worried about Mr. Biden\u2019s durability, Ms. Warren\u2019s liberal politics and unsure of who else can emerge to take on Mr. Trump. But these people, who spoke anonymously to discuss private conversations, say she enjoys the freedom that comes with not being on the ballot.\n\nMr. Bloomberg is said to be more eager to find a way into the race \u2014 and chatter about his potential candidacy has only grown among Democrats who work on Wall Street and are concerned about Ms. Warren\u2019s rise. He raised some eyebrows recently by putting off a fund-raising request from one third-party Democratic group until he knew about his own intentions, according to two Democrats familiar with the conversation. But the former New York mayor has flirted with presidential runs before, only to pull back. Friends say he recognizes his long odds at this stage of the race and his advisers suggest he will play a significant financial role in the 2020 race without his name on the ballot. Still, it\u2019s unlikely that the what-if musing, particularly among the party\u2019s class of donors, elected officials and strategists, will quiet down as long as Mr. Biden is struggling and Ms. Warren, the Massachusetts senator, is surging. \u201cWith Trump looming, there is genuine concern that the horse many have bet on may be pulling up lame and the horse who has sprinted out front may not be able to win,\u201d said David Axelrod, a former adviser to President Barack Obama.\n\nWhile much of the daydreaming about a last-minute entry comes from pro-business Democrats, it is not confined to the wealthy. Mr. Brown and Ms. Schultz noted that they were hearing from a broad range of people but declined to offer any names. He said he was staying out of the race and had no regrets. The Ohio senator said he was confident Democrats would eventually rally behind their nominee, but he warned the party not to embrace a single-payer health care plan that eliminates private insurance. \u201cI think it\u2019ll be a hard sell to the public if we go into the general election for \u2018Medicare for all,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Brown, citing the risk of alienating union workers who would lose their negotiated plans. One longtime Democrat who originally sought to entice Mr. Brown into the race, Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, could not help letting out a loud \u201coy!\u201d when asked about the possibility of another candidate joining the sprawling field. \u201cFor as long as I have been in politics, I\u2019ve heard Democrats fretting about their presidential contenders,\u201d said Ms. Weingarten. Indeed, for some Democrats, the grass is always greener outside their field. There were multiple stages of the 1992 primary when Bill Clinton\u2019s candidacy was seen as doomed, either because of his own vulnerabilities or because of the third-party threat of H. Ross Perot. Would-be Democratic saviors that year included Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York, former Senators Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, Sam Nunn of Georgia and Al Gore of Tennessee, and Representative Richard Gephardt of Missouri. In the 2004 race, Mr. Gore was again sought after as a potential candidate. That race evolved along similar lines to the current primary, with Democrats desperate to oust an incumbent Republican (George W. Bush) but nervous that their front-runner into the fall (Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont) would prove unelectable as the nominee. That time, a candidate did come in relatively late in the race, Wesley K. Clark, a retired general, but he gained little traction and Mr. Kerry ultimately won the nomination. At this time four years ago, it was Mr. Biden who some Democrats were hoping would join the race to offer the party another option besides Mrs. Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Mr. Biden, of course, decided not to run. But now it\u2019s his own candidacy that\u2019s prompting a familiar call for the cavalry, or at least one horse-bound white knight. \u201cIf Biden were surging, I doubt you would be hearing this,\u201d said Harold Ickes, a longtime Democratic consultant. \u201cThis shows a restlessness among a lot of people.\u201d",

HerndonPRINT EDITIONCandidates Rebuke Trump At Criminal Justice Forum|October 27, 2019, Page A18",
      "author": "Astead W. Herndon",
      "content": " COLUMBIA, S.C. \u2014 One day after President Trump claimed he had done more for black voters than the Obama administration had, several Democratic presidential candidates spoke at the same historically black college on Saturday and issued a blistering rebuke of both the president and the event\u2019s organizers \u2014 whom they accused of giving Mr. Trump an undeserved platform. Senator Kamala Harris of California led the charge, and was set to boycott the event altogether until the group that had invited Mr. Trump was removed as a sponsor. Other candidates, including Joseph R. Biden Jr., Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., said the president had a history of racist demagogy that outweighed any recent efforts at criminal justice reform, including the First Step Act, which he signed into law last year. The First Step Act was a bipartisan bill that helped thousands of federal inmates secure early release under new sentencing guidelines, but Democrats were united in framing it as an insufficient measure. They called for more structural reforms to the criminal justice system, and took aim at Mr. Trump himself, who has made exploitation of racial grievance a trademark of his political brand. \u201cI find it hypocritical of him to tout whatever advances have been made in the First Step Act given his history,\u201d Ms. Harris said. \u201cThe hypocrisy is deafening.\u201d Mr. Biden spoke last, and joked to an audience that had been there for most of the day that they probably felt \u201cincarcerated\u201d themselves. He arrived and left to applause. \u201cI\u2019ve done a lot of work on this,\u201d Mr. Biden said. He made few mentions of his decades-long effort to revamp the country\u2019s criminal justice system. The legislation has been criticized for leading to an explosion of the country's prison population, with particular effects for nonwhite communities. \u201cIt\u2019s not to let people out of jail,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cYou have to let them out of jail and have access to housing and give them programs available to keep them out  of the criminal justice system.\u201d In the Democratic primary, black voters play a vital role in determining the party\u2019s nominee, and South Carolina will be especially important. The state is fourth in the nomination process and black voters make up more than 60 percent of the Democratic electorate. With that in mind, candidates \u2014 white and black \u2014 have made appealing to black voters a key part of their 2020 pitch. Polling shows that Mr. Biden remains the overwhelming favorite of black voters and the pacesetter in South Carolina. Other candidates have struggled to make inroads, and have leaned on a policy-first message to prove their bona fides to the black community. This includes introducing proposals about criminal justice reform, but also infusing more traditional \u201ckitchen table\u201d issues with a view of racial equity. In the presidential announcement video of Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, for example, she mentioned the black-white economic wealth gap. And Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey was among the first candidates to propose not only legalizing marijuana but expunging records of past offenders. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to take Kim Kardashian coming to the White House to expunge people\u2019s records,\u201d said Mr. Booker, referencing Mr. Trump\u2019s close relationship with the reality television mogul who has taken up the cause of criminal justice reform in recent years. Mr. Sanders also recently announced a proposal to legalize marijuana. In his speech, he called for Democrats to rethink their relationship to the carceral system altogether. \u201cThe primary goal of a criminal justice system should not be punishment, but whenever possible, rehabilitation,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. Saturday marked the second day of the three-day event, billed as the \u201cSecond Step Presidential Justice Forum.\u201d Mr. Trump opened the session with keynote remarks Friday, and leading Democratic presidential candidates spoke throughout Saturday and will continue on Sunday, when Senator Warren, former cabinet secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro and Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii will appear. On Saturday morning, Mr. Buttigieg announced a new criminal justice plan. It called for reducing the prison population nationwide by 50 percent and diversifying the judiciary, among other goals. Mr. Buttigieg has soared to the top tier of the Democratic field, but has struggled to overcome a reputation that his campaign has neglected outreach to black voters. In his speech, he said the president had inflamed racial division and that it must be rooted out from the country\u2019s core. He also said his own experience as a gay man in America had helped him learn about structural barriers, implicit biases, and discrimination. \u201cI believe that if we do not destroy white supremacy in our lifetime, it could well destroy the American project in our lifetime,\u201d Mr. Buttigieg said in his address. Mr. Trump\u2019s visit on Friday, his first to the campus of a historically black college since being elected, created a surge of interest in the event and threatened to overshadow many of the Democratic candidates. On Saturday, Mr. Trump again placed himself in the middle of the tumult: He attacked Ms. Harris in a morning tweet, calling her a \u201cbadly failing presidential candidate\u201d and added that the First Step Act and what he described as \u201cthe best unemployment numbers EVER\u201d were \u201cmore than Kamala will EVER be able to do for African Americans!\u201d Ms. Harris responded with a tweet of her own, saying, \u201cMy whole life I\u2019ve fought for justice and for the people \u2014 something you\u2019d know nothing about.\u201d The back and forth became the talk of campus Saturday, as Ms. Harris and Mr. Booker both criticized the group that had organized the event, a coalition of black Democrats and Republicans called the 20/20 Bipartisan Justice Center. The group on Friday gave Mr. Trump a criminal justice award and the opportunity to speak in front of a handpicked audience at Benedict College that largely excluded students \u2014 prompting the threat by Ms. Harris to boycott the forum. \u201cOnce I heard that Trump received an award at the Second Step Presidential Justice Forum and stopped HBCU students from attending, I decided to do my own criminal justice reform event tomorrow instead,\u201d she said. \u201cI won\u2019t be complicit in papering over his record.\u201d Ms. Harris later announced she would rejoin the forum, after the 20/20 Bipartisan Justice Center had been removed as an event sponsor. Mr. Booker said he felt the event was too important to miss, but criticized the group for inviting Mr. Trump and presenting him with the award. \u201cDonald Trump was given a platform unchecked for close to an hour,\u201d Mr. Booker said. \u201cThe Bipartisan Justice Center allowed him to create some illusion of support from this community when, in fact, he excluded it.\u201d The actions of the race\u2019s two black senators reverberated across the local community here and with H.B.C.U. leaders across the country. Some praised Ms. Harris for taking a stand. Others, including some Benedict College alumni and black politicians who helped organize the event, felt Ms. Harris drew negative attention to the college as it was striving to gain national attention. De\u2019Keither Stamps, who helped stage the event and is the president of the National Black Caucus of Local Elected Officials, said he was disappointed the controversy over Mr. Trump\u2019s appearance distracted from the forum\u2019s substance. If Ms. Harris had boycotted the event altogether, he said, she would have been at risk of losing good will with black officials. He was glad a compromise was found. \u201cAll\u2019s well that ends well,\u201d Mr. Stamps said. \u201cMy mom even got a picture with her.\u201d",

      "author": "Kenneth P. Vogel",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Rudolph W. Giuliani, President Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, signaled this month that he planned to open a new front in his attacks against former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. \u2014 work done by Mr. Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden for a wealthy Romanian business executive facing corruption charges. But there\u2019s a problem with that strategy: Mr. Giuliani participated in an effort that would have helped the same executive, and was in fact recruited to do so by Louis J. Freeh, a former F.B.I. director who had been brought onto the matter by Hunter Biden. In effect, Mr. Giuliani and Hunter Biden were on the same team, if not at the same time. And their work to help the business executive, along with that of Mr. Freeh, stood in contrast to efforts by the United States, including Vice President Biden while he was in office, to encourage anti-corruption efforts in Romania. The dynamic in Romania underscores how Mr. Giuliani has done a brisk international business with clients who sometimes seem to be seeking to capitalize on his connections to Mr. Trump even as he has accused Hunter Biden of seeking to capitalize on his father\u2019s name while doing business in other countries. And the disclosure of the connection between his role in Romania and Mr. Biden\u2019s comes at a time when Mr. Giuliani, the former New York mayor, is under investigation by federal prosecutors in New York for possible violations of foreign lobbying laws. Hunter Biden, who is a lawyer, was retained by the business executive, Gabriel Popoviciu, in 2015, while his father was vice president, to help try to fend off charges in Romania being pursued by anti-corruption prosecutors. In 2016, Mr. Popoviciu was convicted on charges related to a land deal in northern Bucharest, the Romanian capital. Mr. Popoviciu appealed the decision. Around the time of the 2016 conviction, Mr. Biden recruited Mr. Freeh to assist on the case, according to four people familiar with the effort. Mr. Freeh then retained Mr. Giuliani, who last year criticized Romania\u2019s anti-corruption crackdown and urged amnesty to those who had been convicted, which could have included Mr. Popoviciu. Mr. Giuliani\u2019s involvement came after Mr. Biden bowed out of the case, according to three people familiar with the arrangements. The episode, elements of which were reported Thursday by NBC News, is another example of the paydays available to politically prominent Americans willing to work for foreign interests, some of whom are hoping to parlay Washington connections into favorable treatment at home and on the world stage. Hunter Biden also served as a board member of a Ukrainian energy company owned by an oligarch who had been battling accusations of corruption at the same time that Vice President Biden \u2014 now a leading 2020 Democratic presidential candidate \u2014 was pressing the Ukrainian government to step up its anti-corruption efforts. Hunter Biden was paid as much as $50,000 a month for his role on the board. Efforts by Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Trump to pressure the current Ukrainian government into investigating the Bidens helped lead to the impeachment inquiry underway by House Democrats. Mr. Trump also asked China to investigate Hunter Biden\u2019s business there, a request that was rejected by the Chinese government. There is no evidence that Vice President Biden acted improperly in any of the situations involving his son. Andrew Bates, a Biden campaign spokesman, said, \u201cAmericans are not going to be hoodwinked by a president desperately trying to turn attention to anything but his own corrupt behavior.\u201d Hunter Biden acknowledged in an interview with ABC News this month that he exercised \u201cpoor judgment,\u201d by joining the board of the Ukrainian gas company Burisma Holdings but said he has done nothing wrong. He left the company\u2019s board in April. This month, he announced he would step down from the board of a Chinese company and would not work for or with any foreign-owned companies if his father were elected president. George Mesires, a lawyer for Hunter Biden, said his client never discussed the Popoviciu case, Romanian anti-corruption efforts or anything else related to Romania with his father. Mr. Popoviciu\u2019s hiring of well-connected Americans seemed to be an effort to leverage \u201cthe importance to the Romanian government of the U.S.-Romanian bilateral\u201d relationship \u201cto influence and possibly overcome his political challenges in Romania,\u201d said Heather A. Conley, who was a deputy assistant secretary of state in the bureau of European and Eurasian affairs from 2001 to 2005. Ms. Conley, who is director of the Europe program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, warned that going to work in \u201cenvironments where corruption is very prevalent such as Romania should be a blinking yellow light of caution reputationally for U.S. firms and individuals.\u201d Early this month, Mr. Giuliani suggested that he intended to soon draw attention to Hunter Biden\u2019s work in Romania. During an appearance on Fox News in which Mr. Giuliani reiterated his claims about the Bidens\u2019 activities in Ukraine and China, he announced, as the segment was nearing its end, that \u201cthere\u2019s a lot more to come out. We haven\u2019t moved to Romania, yet. Wait until we get to Romania.\u201d Mr. Trump referred to Hunter Biden\u2019s Romania work for the first time on Friday in remarks to reporters on the South Lawn of the White House. \u201cWell, I think what Biden did, and his son \u2014 and now, I guess, they\u2019re finding also Romania; that just came out today. Or some other country. And I\u2019m sure there are more than that,\u201d the president said. As far back as May, Mr. Giuliani indicated to The New York Times that he intended to ask Mr. Freeh for information about Hunter Biden\u2019s work in Romania. It is not clear if he did so. Neither executives at Mr. Freeh\u2019s company, Freeh Group International Solutions, nor Mr. Giuliani responded to requests for comment this week. Hunter Biden\u2019s work for Mr. Popoviciu was first reported by The New York Times in May. But new details demonstrate how Hunter Biden\u2019s efforts stood in contrast to the message being delivered in Romania by his father and put him on the same side of the case as Mr. Giuliani. Hunter Biden agreed to work for Mr. Popoviciu at a time when Mr. Popoviciu was being targeted by an anti-corruption campaign that had been championed by Vice President Biden and other Western leaders. In a May 2014 speech to politicians in Bucharest, Vice President Biden assailed corruption as \u201ca cancer that eats away at a citizen\u2019s faith in democracy\u201d and \u201ccan represent a clear and present danger not only to a nation\u2019s economy, but to its very national security.\u201d About two years after that speech, Mr. Popoviciu was convicted in a case brought by an anticorruption agency that the vice president had praised. In 2015, before his first trip to Romania, Hunter Biden met with the Romanian ambassador to the United States in the country\u2019s embassy in Washington, according to two people familiar with the meeting. Mr. Biden stressed that he was undertaking the trip as a private citizen, and did not expressly mention Mr. Popoviciu, or his case, one of the people said. At one point, Hunter Biden approached Mark Gitenstein, a former American ambassador to Romania during President Barack Obama\u2019s first term, to discuss the possibility of referring the Popoviciu case to Mr. Freeh, according to someone familiar with the conversation. Mr. Gitenstein, who had served as a Senate aide for the senior Mr. Biden and now sits on the board of the Biden Foundation, defended the work of the prosecutors who targeted Mr. Popoviciu. \u201cBoth the vice president and I had total confidence in the anti-corruption prosecutors in Romania, and did everything in our power to support them, both during our time in office and after,\u201d Mr. Gitenstein said. Mr. Mesires acknowledged that Hunter Biden referred Mr. Popoviciu to both Boies Schiller Flexner, the law firm where Hunter Biden worked at the time, and Mr. Freeh\u2019s firm, Freeh Group International Solutions. Mr. Popoviciu hired both firms, according to four people familiar with the arrangements. Mr. Popoviciu could not be reached for comment. Boies Schiller Flexner declined to comment. Mr. Freeh\u2019s firm started work for the Romanian businessman in July 2016, shortly after Mr. Popoviciu was initially convicted by a Romanian court. Mr. Freeh conducted a review of the case with a team of retired prosecutors and F.B.I. agents. The team concluded there were \u201cnumerous factual and legal deficiencies in the case,\u201d according to a statement summarizing the findings issued in 2017, after the Romanian high court upheld Mr. Popoviciu\u2019s conviction and handed down a seven-year prison sentence. Mr. Freeh called for Romanian authorities to review the case, and reach \u201canother result.\u201d That has not happened. Mr. Popoviciu was arrested in London shortly after the high court\u2019s decision. He posted bail and is fighting extradition to Romania. While Mr. Biden ended his work on the case at some point after recruiting Mr. Freeh, Mr. Freeh continued working for Mr. Popoviciu. Last year, Mr. Freeh retained Mr. Giuliani, a longtime associate whose 2008 presidential campaign Mr. Freeh supported, to help with his efforts in Romania. In August 2018, while serving as Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer during the special counsel\u2019s investigation into Russia\u2019s election interference, Mr. Giuliani wrote a letter to Romania\u2019s president criticizing the country\u2019s anti-corruption prosecutors and urging amnesty to those who had been convicted in the crackdown. That could have included Mr. Popoviciu, though Mr. Giuliani did not explicitly mention him in the letter. Mr. Giuliani said the Freeh Group was paying his fee, but did not identify the Freeh Group client on whose behalf he wrote the letter. However, he told Politico at the time that it \u201cwas based on a report I reviewed\u201d by Mr. Freeh. In the letter, Mr. Giuliani expressed concern about the \u201ccontinuing damage to the rule of law being done under the guise of effective law enforcement\u201d in Romania. Less than two months earlier, the American embassy in Bucharest, along with the embassies of 11 other countries, had issued a statement reaching the opposite conclusion. It highlighted Romania\u2019s \u201cconsiderable progress\u201d in combating corruption and in building an effective rule of law. The statement, which came at a time when contentious alterations to the criminal code were moving through the Romanian parliament, also called on all parties involved to \u201cavoid changes that would weaken the rule of law or Romania\u2019s ability to fight crime or corruption.\u201d",

      "author": "Shane Goldmacher",
      "content": " Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s campaign effectively dropped its longstanding opposition to receiving the assistance of super PACs on Thursday, opening the door for wealthy supporters to spend unlimited amounts of money to try and lift him in the Democratic primary. The move represents a stark reversal and an implicit acknowledgment of his weakened position in the contest. He entered October with only $9 million in the bank, a fraction of his leading rivals. Mr. Biden had explicitly denounced support from a super PAC in his 2020 run and had previously said he would not have blessed one if he had run in 2016. As recently as a month ago, when a possible pro-Biden super PAC surfaced, his campaign denounced the effort. But on Thursday, Kate Bedingfield, his deputy campaign manager, softened that stance, blaming the barrage of ads and attacks from President Trump and his allies and accusing them of interfering in the Democratic primary. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear: Donald Trump has decided that the general election has already begun,\u201d Ms. Bedingfield said. \u201cHe and his allies are already spending massive amounts of money on paid television and digital advertising to intervene directly in Democratic primaries with the goal of preventing Joe Biden, the opponent that Trump fears most, from becoming the Democratic nominee.\u201d She said Mr. Biden maintained his desire to remove private money from federal campaigns but \u201cnothing changes unless we defeat Donald Trump.\u201d Faiz Shakir, the campaign manager for Senator Bernie Sanders, immediately criticized the flip. \u201cThe former vice president has been unable to generate grass roots support, and now his campaign is endorsing an effort to buy the primary through a super PAC that can rake in unlimited cash from billionaires and corporations,\u201d Mr. Shakir said. During a town hall-style event in Marshalltown, Iowa, on Thursday evening, Mr. Sanders laced into Mr. Biden further. \u201cWell, Joe Biden didn\u2019t have to convince me not to start a super PAC,\u201d he said, in response to a question from an audience member about Mr. Biden telling Mr. Sanders during his 2016 campaign run that he didn\u2019t need to start a super PAC. Mr. Sanders later added: \u201cI don\u2019t need a super PAC. I am not going to be controlled by a handful of wealthy people. I will be controlled by the working people of this country.\u201d Mr. Biden himself had framed his opposition to super PACs around the ability to appeal to middle-class Americans. \u201cI\u2019ve said it before and I\u2019ll say it again. To speak to the middle class, we need to reject the super PAC system,\u201d he wrote on Twitter in April. The Biden campaign had maintained its anti-super PAC posture in late September even as Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks were underway, citing it as a matter of principle. \u201cThe attacks aimed at this campaign from dark money groups helping Donald Trump spread his outlandish lies and slander have only served as a reminder of the urgent need for campaign finance reform,\u201d T.J. Ducklo, a Biden spokesman, said then. \u201cWhich is exactly why since the beginning of this campaign, Biden for President has not and will not welcome the help of super PACs.\u201d  While the Biden campaign statement on Thursday did not explicitly embrace a super PAC, Tiffany Muller, the president of End Citizens United, which opposes big money in politics, said that Biden campaign staff confirmed that Mr. Biden was dropping his opposition to a super PAC. \u201cIt is incredibly disappointing to see Vice President Biden completely reverse his position now that times are tough,\u201d Ms. Muller said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we could say it as well as he did when he said, \u2018People can\u2019t possibly trust you\u2019 if you accept support from a super PAC.\u2019\u201d Officials involved in the pro-Biden super PAC discussions a month ago had included Larry Rasky, a former aide to Mr. Biden, Mark Riddle, a political strategist, and Philip Munger, a prominent Democratic donor. \u201cWe intend to fight back against the lies and distortions we\u2019re seeing now from Trump, his allies, the Russians, and the Republican Party,\u201d Mr. Rasky said. \u201cWhile other candidates have groups supporting their efforts, no other Democrat has to fight this two-front war. We know Joe Biden is the best candidate to defeat Donald Trump \u2014 and so does Donald Trump.\u201d The Democrats planning the pro-Biden super PAC, which include Julianna Smoot, a former top fund-raiser for Barack Obama, have also contacted Steve Schale, a Florida-based strategist, about playing a key role, according to party officials familiar with the conversations.

      "author": "Danny Hakim",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 A White House national security official who is a decorated Iraq war veteran plans to tell House impeachment investigators on Tuesday that he heard President Trump appeal to Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate one of his leading political rivals, a request the aide considered so damaging to American interests that he reported it to a superior. Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman of the Army, the top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council, twice registered internal objections about how Mr. Trump and his inner circle were treating Ukraine, out of what he called a \u201csense of duty,\u201d he plans to tell the inquiry, according to a draft of his opening statement obtained by The New York Times. He will be the first White House official to testify who listened in on the July 25 telephone call between Mr. Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine that is at the center of the impeachment inquiry, in which Mr. Trump asked Mr. Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. \u201cI did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government\u2019s support of Ukraine,\u201d Colonel Vindman said in his statement. \u201cI realized that if Ukraine pursued an investigation into the Bidens and Burisma it would likely be interpreted as a partisan play which would undoubtedly result in Ukraine losing the bipartisan support it has thus far maintained.\u201d Burisma Holdings is an energy company on whose board Mr. Biden\u2019s son served while his father was vice president. \u201cThis would all undermine U.S. national security,\u201d Colonel Vindman added, referring to Mr. Trump\u2019s comments in the call. The colonel, a Ukrainian-American immigrant who received a Purple Heart after being wounded in Iraq by a roadside bomb and whose statement is full of references to duty and patriotism, could be a more difficult witness to dismiss than his civilian counterparts. \u201cI am a patriot,\u201d Colonel Vindman plans to tell the investigators, \u201cand it is my sacred duty and honor to advance and defend our country irrespective of party or politics.\u201d He was to be interviewed privately on Tuesday by the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight and Reform Committees, in defiance of a White House edict not to cooperate with the impeachment inquiry. The colonel, who is represented by Michael Volkov, a former federal prosecutor, declined to comment for this article. In his testimony, Colonel Vindman plans to say that he is not the whistle-blower who initially reported Mr. Trump\u2019s pressure campaign on Ukraine. But he will provide an account that corroborates and fleshes out crucial elements in that complaint, which prompted Democrats to open their impeachment investigation. \u201cI did convey certain concerns internally to national security officials in accordance with my decades of experience and training, sense of duty, and obligation to operate within the chain of command,\u201d he plans to say. He will testify that he watched with alarm as \u201coutside influencers\u201d began pushing a \u201cfalse narrative\u201d about Ukraine that was counter to the consensus view of American national security officials, and harmful to United States interests. According to documents reviewed by The Times on the eve of his congressional testimony, Colonel Vindman was concerned as he discovered that Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, was leading an effort to prod Kiev to investigate Mr. Biden\u2019s son, and to discredit efforts to investigate Mr. Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, and his business dealings in Ukraine. His account strongly suggests that he may have been among the aides the whistle-blower referred to in his complaint when he wrote that White House officials had recounted the conversation between Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky to him, and \u201cwere deeply disturbed by what had transpired in the phone call.\u201d Colonel Vindman did not interact directly with the president, but was present for a series of conversations that shed light on his pressure campaign on Ukraine. He will also testify that he confronted Gordon D. Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union, the day the envoy spoke in a White House meeting with Ukrainian officials about \u201cUkraine delivering specific investigations in order to secure the meeting with the president.\u201d Even as he expressed alarm about the pressure campaign, the colonel and other officials worked to keep the United States relationship with Ukraine on track. At the direction of his superiors at the National Security Council, including John R. Bolton, then the national security adviser, Colonel Vindman drafted a memorandum in mid-August that sought to restart security aid that was being withheld from Ukraine, but Mr. Trump refused to sign it, according to documents reviewed by the Times. And he drafted a letter in May congratulating Mr. Zelensky on his inauguration, but Mr. Trump did not sign that either, according to the documents. Colonel Vindman was concerned after he learned that the White House budget office had taken the unusual step of withholding the $391 million package of security assistance for Ukraine that had been approved by Congress. At least one previous witness has testified that Mr. Trump directed that the aid be frozen until he could secure a commitment from Mr. Zelensky to announce an investigation of the Bidens. While Colonel Vindman\u2019s concerns were shared by a number of other officials, some of whom have already testified, he was in a unique position. Because he emigrated from Ukraine along with his family when he was a child and is fluent in Ukrainian and Russian, Ukrainian officials sought advice from him about how to deal with Mr. Giuliani, though they typically communicated in English. On two occasions, the colonel brought his concerns to John A. Eisenberg, the top lawyer at the National Security Council. The first came on July 10. That day, senior American officials met with senior Ukrainian officials at the White House, in a stormy meeting in which Mr. Bolton is said to have had a tense exchange with Mr. Sondland after the ambassador raised the matter of investigations he wanted Ukraine to undertake. That meeting has been described in previous testimony in the impeachment inquiry. At a debriefing later that day attended by the colonel, Mr. Sondland again urged Ukrainian officials to help with investigations into Mr. Trump\u2019s political rivals. \u201cAmbassador Sondland emphasized the importance that Ukraine deliver the investigations into the 2016 election, the Bidens and Burisma,\u201d Colonel Vindman said in his draft statement. \u201cI stated to Ambassador Sondland that his statements were inappropriate\u201d and that the \u201crequest to investigate Biden and his son had nothing to do with national security, and that such investigations were not something the N.S.C. was going to get involved in or push,\u201d he added. The colonel\u2019s account echoed the testimony of Fiona Hill, one of his superiors, who has previously testified behind closed doors that she and Mr. Bolton were angered by efforts to politicize the interactions with Ukraine. The colonel said that after his confrontation with Mr. Sondland, \u201cDr. Hill then entered the room and asserted to Ambassador Sondland that his statements were inappropriate.\u201d Ms. Hill, the former senior director for European and Russian affairs, also reported the incident to Mr. Eisenberg. The colonel went to Mr. Eisenberg a couple of weeks later, after the president\u2019s call with Mr. Zelensky. This time, the colonel was accompanied by his identical twin brother, Yevgeny, who is a lawyer on the National Security Council. The picture painted by Colonel Vindman\u2019s testimony has been echoed by several other senior officials, including William B. Taylor Jr., the top American diplomat in Ukraine, who testified last week that multiple senior administration officials had told him that the president blocked security aid to Ukraine and would not meet with Mr. Zelensky until he publicly pledged to investigate Mr. Trump\u2019s political rivals. While the White House has urged witnesses subpoenaed by Congress not to participate in the impeachment inquiry, failing to comply with a congressional subpoena would be a risky career move for an active-duty military officer. As tensions grew over Ukraine policy, the White House appears to have frozen out Colonel Vindman. Since early August, he has been excluded from a number of relevant meetings and events, including a diplomatic trip to three countries under his purview: Ukraine, Moldova and Belarus. Colonel Vindman said he had reported concerns up his chain of command because he believed he was obligated to do so. \u201cOn many occasions I have been told I should express my views and share my concerns with my chain of command and proper authorities,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe that any good military officer should and would do the same, thus providing his or her best advice to leadership.\u201d",

His experience as a senator helps explain his restraint.By Matt FlegenheimerPRINT EDITIONBiden\u2019s Years in Senate Fueled His Wariness of Impeachment|October 10, 2019, Page A1",
      "author": "Matt Flegenheimer",
      "content": " President Richard M. Nixon was running low on bipartisan allies. Indictments were piling. Impeachment was coming. Mr. Nixon was not a crook, he insisted, though that 18-and-a-half-minute gap in the Watergate tapes did make the town wonder. But from the Senate floor in April 1974, Joseph R. Biden Jr., a 31-year-old freshman Democrat, addressed his congressional elders with a plea: Let the Republican president have his say. \u201cIn the case of an impeachment trial, the emotions of the American people would be strummed, as a guitar, with every newscast and each edition of the daily paper,\u201d Mr. Biden warned. \u201cThe incessant demand for news or rumors of news \u2014 whatever its basis of legitimacy \u2014 would be overwhelming.\u201d He urged against \u201cAlice-in-Wonderland\u201d justice: \u201csentence first, verdict afterwards.\u201d He said that if he had to render a judgment on that day, his choice would be \u201cNot Guilty.\u201d Mr. Biden was no fan of the president\u2019s, he said \u2014 and might well find him culpable once all facts were aired. But this was a time for \u201crestraint.\u201d \u201cI have a feeling,\u201d he said, \u201cthat my children and my grandchildren will be looking back on what I said or did not say in April of 1974.\u201d Forty-five years later, Mr. Biden finds himself consumed by an impeachment drama of a different sort. He is at the center of the emerging Democratic case against President Trump, who in a July phone call pressed the president of Ukraine to investigate Mr. Biden and his son. It is a testament to the long and winding arc of Mr. Biden\u2019s public life that he has been a player in every major impeachment debate of the last half-century. Yet while other 2020 candidates have long argued that Mr. Trump\u2019s conduct demands an extraordinary constitutional response, Mr. Biden has approached the subject with striking wariness, quick to defend his name but disinclined to position himself as an impeachment crusader, despite the perils the president\u2019s unsubstantiated attacks may pose to Mr. Biden\u2019s own campaign. On Wednesday, after weeks of caution \u2014 leaving the task to Congress, taking care to stay in his lane \u2014 Mr. Biden called unambiguously for Mr. Trump\u2019s impeachment for the first time, saying the president had \u201cbetrayed this nation.\u201d It was a moment that Mr. Biden reached reluctantly. Though he had said before that Mr. Trump had probably violated his \u201cconstitutional responsibility,\u201d the former vice president has also called Mr. Trump\u2019s prospective impeachment \u201ca tragedy.\u201d A review of Mr. Biden\u2019s history with the topic, as a senator during the Nixon and Clinton administrations, helps explain why. Decades before he moved from ensemble figure to leading character in the nation\u2019s impeachment theater, friends and peers from his Senate days say those episodes made plain to Mr. Biden just how damaging and unseemly the proceedings could be for all involved. In both public remarks and private conversations with colleagues, Mr. Biden conveyed his discomfort with overturning the will of the voters, regardless of the executive transgression. He suggested that public opinion should be taken into consideration, even for senators who preferred to vote their conscience, since it was the choice of the electorate that lawmakers presumed to override. \u201cThis. Is. Their. President,\u201d he thundered at an event in November 1998 as President Bill Clinton\u2019s fortunes rested with Congress, summarizing the view of Democratic voters whom Mr. Biden said he had met. \u201cDon\u2019t screw with him unless you have an overwhelming case that you can make that you\u2019re being fair about it.\u201d And in an early signal of Mr. Biden\u2019s deference to formal protocol, his experiences in the 1970s and 1990s seemed to crystallize the abiding faith in institutions \u2014 deep respect for the Senate, a reverence for process \u2014 that remains his hallmark, even as his current competitors suggest he is out of step with the crackling tribalism of the Trump era. \u201cHe stuck with kind of an institutional approach to things, which he did for his whole career,\u201d said Ted Kaufman, a longtime friend and aide who worked for Mr. Biden during Watergate and later succeeded him briefly as senator. \u201cLet the system work.\u201d For a young lawmaker straining to find his way amid personal tragedy, the Nixon fracas was an early test of Mr. Biden\u2019s defer-to-convention instincts and a jarring introduction to the capital. After his election in 1972, Mr. Biden had spoken to Mr. Nixon in an uncomfortable, minute-long courtesy phone call from the president after Mr. Biden\u2019s wife and young daughter were killed in a car crash that December. (\u201cI understand you were on the Hill at the time, and your wife was just driving by herself,\u201d Mr. Nixon said, stammering for a few beats, according to a recording. \u201cThe main part is, you can remember that she was there when you won a great victory.\u201d) In his floor speech on impeachment, labeled in the Congressional Record under \u201cFairness to the President,\u201d Mr. Biden described himself as a harsh critic of Mr. Nixon, but he added that the president was due the \u201cutmost presumption of innocence.\u201d \u201cIn a day when equality is on everyone\u2019s lips, I suggest that in practice, in extraordinary times involving our highest office of government, some people may be, in fact, more equal than others,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cAnd in this case, I refer to the president. His official derelictions, if proved, and his subsequent ouster, should it occur, will have an impact on our institutions and upon ourselves as Americans, beyond that which it would have for any of us who are involved in such a proceeding.\u201d Moving through the Capitol, Mr. Biden seemed awed at the historical burden that greeted him. \u201cWe were walking down the hall and he said, \u2018What a time for me to come into the Senate,\u2019\u201d recalled Rufus Edmisten, then the deputy chief counsel to the Senate Watergate committee. \u201c\u2018I would come at a time like this.\u2019\u201d In his 2007 memoir, \u201cPromises to Keep,\u201d Mr. Biden described a formative memory of a crucial meeting after Mr. Nixon asked Senator John Stennis, a conservative Democrat from Mississippi, to run interference for the White House by listening to the Watergate tapes and summarizing them for his colleagues, rather than insisting on their wide release. \u201cI remember what he said in the Democratic caucus that day: \u2018I\u2019ve thought long and hard on what my obligation is,\u2019\u201d Mr. Biden wrote, quoting Mr. Stennis, \u201c\u2018and I\u2019ve decided I am a Senate man. I am not the president\u2019s man. Therefore, I will not listen to the tapes. I am a man of the Senate.\u2019 I\u2019m proud to say I am a Senate man, too.\u201d Mr. Kaufman said that it was not until August, days before Mr. Nixon\u2019s resignation, that Mr. Biden became convinced that the president must go. The senator was walking to catch a train when word arrived that Charles Wiggins, a Republican congressman who had led the Nixon defense, had changed his mind amid revelations that Mr. Nixon had worked to conceal the Watergate break-in. \u201cHe just said, \u2018O.K., this is it,\u2019\u201d Mr. Kaufman recalled of Mr. Biden. \u201cAnd he dictated, literally, to the staff person on what was a big deal: \u2018It was time for Nixon to resign.\u2019\u201d Mr. Biden and his fellow senators seemed relieved that the president had saved them the spectacle of a trial. \u201cNobody was looking forward to the trial,\u201d said J. Bennett Johnston, a former Democratic senator from Louisiana, remembering a petition in his home state to support Mr. Nixon, with some 40,000 names attached. \u201cThere was not as much support in the South for Nixon as there is for Trump now, but he was basically pretty popular. So nobody was looking forward to having to vote on that.\u201d A quarter-century later, when the Senate impeachment trial of Mr. Clinton began, Mr. Biden was not afforded the luxury of a presidential resignation. But with the leader of his own party under scrutiny, Mr. Biden often invoked his appeals for caution in the Nixon age as evidence that he was being intellectually consistent. He said it was a \u201cserious mistake\u201d to overlook public sentiment on impeachment, noting that Democrats had won gains in the 1998 midterm elections. He claimed that the Republican-led House, under Speaker Newt Gingrich, had \u201cproceeded without sufficient dignity.\u201d Barbara Boxer, a former California Democratic senator who joined Mr. Biden in clearing Mr. Clinton in the Senate trial, described impeachment as \u201ca miserable experience\u201d but one that played to Mr. Biden\u2019s strengths as a \u201cstatesman.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s not just going to run out there in flames,\u201d she said. But at times, impeachment has also coaxed less subtle flourishes from Mr. Biden. In an appearance at the National Press Club in November 1998, after distinguishing between immoral and impeachable behavior, he set off on a hypothetical about Mr. Clinton and Monica Lewinsky, implying that had Ms. Lewinsky been Mr. Biden\u2019s daughter, he would have clocked the sitting president. \u201cWere it my daughter \u2014 notwithstanding this particular young woman is not the epitome of what I would want a young woman to be \u2014 I would be looking for the man,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cThose who know me know I\u2019m not joking. I\u2019d be looking for him to give him a straight right.\u201d Notwithstanding this particular senator\u2019s fatherly dream sequence, he also reminded the crowd of his credibility on the broader question of Mr. Clinton\u2019s professional fate. \u201cI made that plea in 1974, and I make the plea again,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cThe plea for restraint.\u201d",

The Top Tier Is All White.Trailing in the money race, tripped up by their own missteps and perceived by some as less electable, nonwhite candidates find themselves well back of the leaders.By Astead W. Herndon and Jonathan MartinPRINT EDITIONDemocrats Have Diverse Field, But the Top Tier Is All White|October 30, 2019, Page A1",
      "author": "Astead W. Herndon",
      "content": "  When the Democratic primary contest began last winter, it featured the most racially diverse field in history, with two black senators, a Latino former cabinet secretary, an Asian-American businessman and the first American Samoan elected to Congress. But 10 months later, the Democratic field has a top tier of four white candidates, three of them men. Candidates of color are languishing in the low single digits in polls, well behind the four leaders \u2014 former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. The divide could become even more pronounced in the coming months: Because of new, more rigorous thresholds for the Democratic debate in December, it is possible that only one nonwhite candidate, Senator Kamala Harris of California, will qualify. With the Iowa caucuses three months away, it\u2019s a noticeable sorting of the field for an increasingly multiracial party, whose most recent White House victories were powered by a strong minority turnout for a black nominee. It has frustrated the Democrats seeking a more diverse party leadership \u2014 not to mention the affected candidates. \u201cI\u2019ve had lots of crazy things said to me, like, \u2018Is America ready for another black president?\u2019\u201d Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey said in an interview. \u201cAnd I\u2019m confident it\u2019s never been asked of a white candidate, \u2018Is America ready for another white president?\u2019\u201d The emergence of an all-white top tier reflects a combination of factors at the intersection of race, money and politics. Financial support from mostly white, educated elites has helped propel the candidacies of Ms. Warren and Mr. Buttigieg, while two nonwhite candidates \u2014 Mr. Booker and Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former housing secretary \u2014 have had to explicitly petition supporters for money to stay in the race. Assumptions about which candidates can or can\u2019t beat President Trump have also hurt minority candidates, with some Democrats fearing that the white working class voters who helped propel Mr. Trump to the White House would not support a nonwhite nominee.  Donors for Mr. Booker and Ms. Harris have argued that such implicit bias causes voters and pundits to treat Mr. Buttigieg as the natural heir to Mr. Biden\u2019s moderate coalition, though their candidates perform better among older black voters, the Democrats\u2019 most loyal moderate voting block. Other Democrats, however, say the blame rests with the candidates themselves. None of the nonwhite challengers have been able to forge a strong coalition or peel away black voters from Mr. Biden. Some voters and elected officials, white and nonwhite alike, now say privately what the polling suggests: They have not been swept off their feet by any of the candidates of color. Theodore Johnson, who studies African-American politics at the Brennan Center for Justice, said the nonwhite contenders, fairly or not, are suffering in comparison to the country\u2019s first black president. \u201cTheir road is easier because of Obama, but their ability to secure the nomination is harder because they\u2019re not Obama,\u201d said Mr. Johnson. Miscalculations along the way have not helped. Ms. Harris has been criticized for waffling on policy, Mr. Booker for timidness and Mr. Castro for a failed debate attack on Mr. Biden in September, which cost him the endorsement of one of his few Congressional allies. Mr. Castro, in an interview, zeroed in on \u201celectability\u201d as a problem, saying that concept has created an unspoken skepticism of nonwhite candidates among Democratic voters. People with this viewpoint, he said, can sometimes see nonwhite candidates as vice-presidential options, but not best equipped to lead the party. \u201cIn every election there\u2019s a current, and the current this year seems to be running toward candidates that people believe can take Donald Trump on with a certain profile of voter \u2014 the white working class in the Midwest,\u201d said Mr. Castro, whose polling support is running at about 1 percent. And, he added, \u201cassumptions are being made on who the best type of candidates are to do that.\u201d Mr. Booker said he thinks the tide will turn as more people seek a strong candidate to replace Mr. Biden as the moderate alternative to Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders. The trouble: getting enough financial support over the next two months to remain viable. \u201cI have to say these last few weeks, a lot of \u2014 a lot more people seem to be coming around,\u201d Mr. Booker said, \u201cand I think some of this might be because they\u2019re seeing some weakness to Biden.\u201d Aimee Allison, founder of She the People, the network of women of color looking to mobilize for the 2020 general election, said it was too early to rule out unforeseen shifts in the race\u2019s current pecking order. But she added that it would take more than an argument for racial representation to win over voters of color and rise in the polls. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had choices like this before, and that makes essentialism less important,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s diversity of opinion. Women of color are sophisticated voters and organizers. We understand that our power and influence can be felt through a candidate of any race and gender with our agenda.\u201d Any assessment of the performance of nonwhite candidates is complicated by Mr. Biden\u2019s enduring appeal with black voters. The former vice president remains popular from his time in the White House serving with President Barack Obama, and he benefits from the perception among many Democrats that he has the best chance to win back white voters who flipped to Mr. Trump. That popularity with African-Americans has helped keep Mr. Biden at or near the lead in the race for months, while preventing candidates like Mr. Booker and Ms. Harris from making inroads in states like South Carolina. One recent poll gave Mr. Biden a 17-point lead over his closest rivals in the state, propelled by the support of about 40 percent of black voters. Even left wing activists who prefer other candidates acknowledge Mr. Biden\u2019s advantage will be difficult to overcome. \u201cLike many black homes in America, my parents\u2019 home has an Obama shrine,\u201d said Tamika Gadsden, a South Carolina-based activist who likes Ms. Warren and Mr. Castro but whose parents side solidly with Mr. Biden. If Mr. Biden falters in predominantly white states that vote earlier, there\u2019s no guarantee that black voters will desert him \u2014 or that their support would automatically go to the race\u2019s black candidates. And the white candidates positioning themselves as moderate alternatives to Mr. Biden, like Mr. Buttigieg and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, have posted dismal numbers with nonwhite voters. Likewise, the candidates vying for the progressive lane, Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders, still face heavy skepticism among the older black voters. \u201cIt\u2019s still early,\u201d said Representative Karen Bass of California, the head of the Congressional Black Caucus, \u201cI don\u2019t take the top four as the fait accompli.\u201d Ms. Warren, of course, would be barrier-breaking in her own right as the first woman to be president, as would Mr. Buttigieg, an openly gay man. Both have risen to the top tier of early-state and national polls, and both are flush with cash from a largely white donor network that has assured them of long term viability. Together, Mr. Sanders, Ms. Warren, Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg have $90 million in cash on hand. Ms. Harris, Mr. Booker, Mr. Castro, Andrew Yang, the Asian-American entrepreneur, and Tulsi Gabbard, the American-Samoan Congresswoman, have about $24 million combined. Mr. Booker and Mr. Castro have, in recent weeks, had to make desperate hat-in-hand pleas for money just to stay in the race, and both received online boosts from prominent black and Latino politicians including Stacey Abrams of Georgia and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, who alluded to the importance of racial representation.  The race could quickly change before voting begins in February. Ms. Harris has more money in the bank, and more endorsements from the Congressional Black Caucus, than Mr. Biden. Mr. Castro has not qualified for the November debate, but Mr. Booker and Ms. Harris have \u2014 and will have more opportunities to catch fire ahead of the Iowa caucuses, which will reshape all expectations in a single night. Conversely, while none of the leading white candidates have proved they can forge a multiracial coalition, they still have time to make inroads. Ms. Warren has gained good will from black and Latino progressives for infusing her policy proposals with planks about racial equity. Mr. Sanders has a vast and diverse donor base, and recently won endorsements from three of the country\u2019s most prominent minority lawmakers, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and Representatives Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan. Ms. Harris, Mr. Castro, and Mr. Booker are inhibited in part because they came up through the Democratic establishment, and have faced criticism for legislative records that are viewed as out of step with the ascendant progressive wing. Mr. Castro, in response, has tried to remake himself as a progressive champion, and even disavowed some of the deportation actions of Mr. Obama\u2019s administration, in which he served. Ms. Harris and Mr. Booker have tried to toe a more careful line, in hopes they can win more moderate black voters should Mr. Biden falter. Mr. Booker has been attacked for his closeness to big donors and mixed police reform record as mayor of Newark. Ms. Harris\u2019s lack of clarity on policy has drawn fire, both from left-wing activists upset with her record as a prosecutor and centrists annoyed that she backed left-wing ideas such as the Green New Deal. Because of this, some black and Latino Democrats push back on the idea that it\u2019s racism or assumptions about electability that have hindered Ms. Booker, Ms. Harris and Mr. Castro. Privately they claim that some nonwhite Democrats who decided not to run, such as Ms. Abrams of Georgia or Andrew Gillum of Florida, would have been stronger candidates. \u201cIt boils down to the candidates themselves,\u201d said Representative Filemon Vela of Texas. \u201cThose structural barriers existed when President Obama ran.\u201d Mr. Vela, for his part, is backing Mr. Biden, convinced that he\u2019s best suited to defeat Mr. Trump. But he thinks a woman of color should be on the ticket and he has one in mind: Senator Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada.",

      "author": "Shane Goldmacher",
      "content": " Steve Ricchetti, one of Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s closest confidantes, is reaching out to wary donors to shore up support. The Biden presidential campaign is watching costs \u2014 some staff members are sleeping at homes of volunteers \u2014 and facing criticism for spending on chartered jets. Mr. Biden\u2019s team is also urging allies to redouble fund-raising efforts before the calendar turns to 2020 and he has fewer days to devote to the money trail. And in a confidential memo to top bundlers this week, Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign manager, Greg Schultz, sought to allay growing concerns that Mr. Biden is facing a cash crunch and won\u2019t be able to stay competitive with his rivals on the airwaves and on the ground. \u201cWe will have the resources we need to execute our plan,\u201d Mr. Schultz wrote in the memo, obtained by The New York Times. But he simultaneously exhorted the money-raisers to do more: \u201cWe\u2019re asking you to dig deep.\u201d The Biden campaign and its backers are racing to contain fallout from revelations this month that his campaign is spending more money than it is taking in, unlike his leading rivals. Mr. Biden\u2019s cash on hand \u2014 $9 million \u2014 is now only a fraction of what Senators Bernie Sanders ($33.7 million) and Elizabeth Warren ($25.7 million) have banked. He even has less on hand than two candidates, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Senator Kamala Harris, who are well behind him in the polls. On Thursday, the Biden campaign delivered the clearest signal yet that it will do whatever it takes to survive financially, abandoning Mr. Biden\u2019s long-held opposition to a super PAC independent of the campaign and clearing the way for donors to give unlimited sums in support of him. Biden advisers cited continuing attacks from President Trump for the reversal. Six months into his candidacy and 100 days until the Iowa caucuses, Mr. Biden is no longer the undisputed Democratic front-runner he once was. He entered the race in April making the case that, as Barack Obama\u2019s vice president and a longtime leader with moderate and liberal views, he stood the best chance of uniting the party, attracting voters across racial, gender and ideological lines and winning over swing voters in battleground states. While Mr. Biden still leads in many polls, and many voters still express deep appreciation for him, his financial situation \u2014 the inability to consolidate traditional big-money donors or inspire a sufficiently large online base of small contributors \u2014 has served as a flashing warning sign about the potential limits of his appeal. One rival, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, said pointedly this week that he was \u201cgetting calls from people who are Biden supporters who now want to hedge their bet\u201d on the former vice president. Ed Rendell, the former Pennsylvania governor and a Biden fund-raiser, acknowledged he had heard the anxieties. \u201cThey\u2019re worried when they see only $9 million in the bank, because donors have a tendency to believe the person with the most amount of money wins,\u201d said Mr. Rendell, who added that he does not share that view. Mr. Schultz, the Biden campaign manager, said in an interview on Friday that Mr. Biden was facing a financial situation unlike any other Democrat: He is taking incoming fire from both the White House and primary opponents on a daily basis, and needs to play both offense and defense within the limits of $2,800 maximum donations. \u201cWe can\u2019t both do a general election and primary. And no one can,\u201d  Mr. Schultz said. Of his rivals who have denounced the super PAC reversal, he added, \u201cIf they were being attacked with $10 million-plus of outside money in a general election sense, I would love to see what they would do.\u201d Mr. Biden\u2019s allies are not only concerned about his fund-raising: There\u2019s also the spending. Mr. Biden raised $15.7 million in the third quarter, but he spent $2 million more than that. Among his biggest expenses was more than $920,000 on chartered jets. Terry McAuliffe, the former governor of Virginia and a prolific fund-raiser, said that donors were \u201cfurious\u201d about the jet spending and called the campaign\u2019s overall money situation \u201cvery alarming.\u201d Mr. McAuliffe\u2019s wife recently invited donors to attend a fund-raiser for Mr. Biden at their home in early November. Mr. Schultz, when asked about the chartered travel, said that \u201cwhatever maximizes Joe Biden and voter interaction, the greater chance we have to win.\u201d The campaign said Mr. Biden had flown commercial but declined to indicate when his last such flight was. The pressure over money is bound to intensify as the leading Democratic campaigns compete in the early voting states and the extraordinarily expensive media markets of Super Tuesday states like California. Ms. Warren, currently Mr. Biden\u2019s top rival, has already reserved $2.3 million more in television ads in the early voting states than he has, according to Advertising Analytics, a media-tracking firm. In the last 30 days, she spent twice as much as Mr. Biden on Facebook ads, while Mr. Buttigieg spent more than three times as much as Mr. Biden, who has begun buying more online ads after he sharply scaled back his digital spending over the summer. Mr. Biden and his advisers wave off any cash concerns, arguing he is already universally known, seen as Mr. Trump\u2019s strongest challenger and beloved in a way money cannot buy. Mr. Biden, in an interview set to air Sunday on \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d gave a blunt answer about how he would overcome his rivals\u2019 cash edge: \u201cI just flat-out beat them.\u201d More than most candidates, Mr. Biden has cultivated major Democratic bundlers who gather checks from friends and fellow supporters. To that end, Mr. Biden has used the old-fashioned strategy of giving fancy titles to his top bundlers: an \u201cadvocate\u201d must raise $25,000, a \u201cprotector\u201d $50,000 and a \u201cunifier\u201d $100,000. Perks, which vary by level, include monthly calls with campaign leadership, and invitations to finance committee retreats and forums. Yet Mr. Biden has struggled to line up the vaunted Obama money operation behind him. Of the nearly 800 bundlers who raised at least $50,000 for Mr. Obama\u2019s 2012 campaign \u2014\u00a0different because it was a presidential re-election, not a crowded primary \u2014\u00a0 less than a quarter have donated to Mr. Biden so far this year, according to an analysis of Federal Election Commission data. An even smaller share are actively tapping their networks for him. One bright spot is that Mr. Biden\u2019s online donations have picked up of late. His best week for raising money since the second week in the race came in late September as the impeachment scandal exploded. Then, in the first half of October, he raised more online than he had raised in all of September, the campaign said. The campaign has employed some sky-is-falling tactics to spur giving, including an email last week threatening \u201cbudget cuts\u201d if more money did not materialize. \u201cLow on resources\u201d was the subject line of a Friday missive. (No cutbacks are planned, the campaign said.) If Mr. Biden\u2019s fund-raising does not improve, he could be hard-pressed to ramp up his operations for the primary season. Just to pay for his existing campaign infrastructure through the Iowa caucuses would require the $9 million he has in the bank now plus the full fund-raising haul that he had in the third quarter. In his memo to bundlers, Mr. Schultz outlined ways they were already trying to control costs, including having the headquarters staff stay at the homes of supporters \u201cwhenever it is available.\u201d \u201cClearly everybody would have liked if the Biden campaign raised more in the last quarter,\u201d said Joe Falk, a Biden fund-raiser in Florida. But Mr. Falk remained bullish on Mr. Biden\u2019s position in the race. \u201cGiven the full frontal assault from the Republicans, the Russian bots and the competitors, his polling numbers are holding up better than expected,\u201d he said. Despite the competition from two liberals, Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders, who have rejected the donor class and would be further left than any Democratic nominee in many years, Mr. Biden\u2019s team has been unable to fully consolidate support of the Democratic establishment. He has been out-raised in the last two quarters by Mr. Buttigieg, who has won over many former Obama-era ambassadors as a 37-year-old fresh face for the party. Last Monday, Bradley Tusk, who served as a re-election campaign manager for Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York City, hosted a fund-raiser for Mr. Buttigieg. According to Mr. Tusk, the crowd was filled with \u201ca lot of those people you would have thought would be Biden people. And they weren\u2019t.\u201d (Attendees included Jon S. Corzine, the former New Jersey governor and Goldman Sachs executive, who had previously attended a Biden event in the Hamptons in the summer.) \u201cThe feeling in the room,\u201d Mr. Tusk said, \u201cwas that Biden has already lost.\u201d Mr. Biden\u2019s dependence on donors who have given the $2,800 maximum amount was one reason for the reversal on a super PAC, which provides those donors a new outlet to give even more. Records show that almost 35 percent of the $37.7 million that Mr. Biden has raised so far has come from donors who have given the maximum. \u201cIt just means we have to find new people, and the people we have found \u2014 the people who gave $2,800 \u2014 they ought to be able to find a buddy or two buddies,\u201d said Alan Kessler, a lawyer in Pennsylvania raising money for Mr. Biden. The super PAC reversal ignited swift denunciations from Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren, both of whom were running anti-super-PAC ads on Facebook within 24 hours. In addition to whatever the pro-Biden super PAC does, the International Association of Fire Fighters is preparing a pro-Biden campaign of its own, with a six-figure budget of mostly online spending, said Mark Treglio, a spokesman for the union. The need for options like a super PAC reflect the reality that it can be especially hard for a candidate relying on big donors to raise money deeper into a campaign. When Mr. Biden took his campaign\u2019s first trip to Southern California in May, he held three fund-raisers where a combined more than 600 people attended. But when he returned in October, he again held three events and drew about half as many people, a bit more than 300. Next week, he is headed to Florida for at least two fund-raisers, according to people familiar with his schedule.. Mr. Biden\u2019s advisers and allies repeatedly emphasize that while he may not compete dollar for dollar with some rivals \u2014 or even come close \u2014 he is intrinsically different because he is already universally known and widely liked and seen as formidable against Mr. Trump. The word they kept coming back to was \u201cresilience.\u201d As in, Mr. Biden has suffered through six months of criticism and attacks \u2014 from his rivals, from the news media, from the president \u2014 and remains at or near the top of the national polls. \u201cAny other candidate, it might concern you,\u201d Mike Collier, a Texas bundler for Mr. Biden who has previously run for office himself, said of the campaign\u2019s finances. \u201cBut with someone like Joe, I\u2019m not anywhere near as concerned.\u201d",

      "content": "   WASHINGTON \u2014 Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman, the top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council, told House impeachment investigators on Tuesday that the White House transcript of a July call between President Trump and Ukraine\u2019s president omitted crucial words and phrases, and that his attempts to include them failed, according to three people familiar with the testimony. The omissions, Colonel Vindman said, included Mr. Trump\u2019s assertion that there were recordings of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. discussing Ukraine corruption, and an explicit mention by Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, of Burisma Holdings, the energy company whose board employed Mr. Biden\u2019s son Hunter. Colonel Vindman, who appeared on Capitol Hill wearing his dark blue Army dress uniform and military ribbons, told House impeachment investigators that he tried to change the reconstructed transcript made by the White House staff to reflect the omissions. But while some of his edits appeared to have been successful, he said, those two corrections were not made. Colonel Vindman did not testify to a motive behind the White House editing process. But his testimony is likely to drive investigators to ask further questions about how officials handled the call, including changes to the transcript and the decision to put it into the White House\u2019s most classified computer system \u2014 and whether those moves were meant to conceal the conversation\u2019s most controversial aspects. The phrases do not fundamentally change lawmakers\u2019 understanding of the call, which was first reported by the C.I.A. whistle-blower whose complaint set off the impeachment inquiry. There are plenty of other examples of Mr. Trump referring to Ukraine-related conspiracy theories and asking for investigations of the Biden family. But Colonel Vindman\u2019s account offered a hint to solving a mystery surrounding the conversation: what Mr. Trump\u2019s aides left out of the transcript in places where ellipses indicated dropped words. In hours of questioning on Tuesday by Democrats and Republicans, Colonel Vindman recounted his alarm at the July 25 call, saying he \u201cdid not think it was proper\u201d for Mr. Trump to have asked Mr. Zelensky to investigate a political rival, and how White House officials struggled to deal with the fallout from a conversation he and others considered problematic. His testimony about the reconstructed transcript, the aftermath of the call and a shadow foreign policy being run outside the National Security Council came as Democrats unveiled plans for a more public phase of the impeachment process. They plan to vote on Thursday to direct the Intelligence Committee to conduct public hearings and produce a report for the Judiciary Committee to guide its consideration of impeachment articles. The measure will also provide a mechanism for Republicans to request subpoenas for witnesses and give Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers a substantive role in the Judiciary Committee\u2019s proceedings to mount a defense. Some lawmakers indicated Colonel Vindman would make a good candidate to appear again at a public hearing next month. It is not clear why some of Colonel Vindman\u2019s changes were not made, but the decision by a White House lawyer to quickly lock down the reconstructed transcript subverted the normal process of handling such documents, according to people familiar with the matter. The note-takers and voice recognition software used during the July 25 call had missed Mr. Zelensky saying the word \u201cBurisma,\u201d according to people briefed on the matter, but the reconstructed transcript does refer to \u201cthe company,\u201d and suggests that the Ukrainian president is aware that it is of great interest to Mr. Trump. Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general, Mr. Zelensky said, according to the document, \u201cwill look into the situation, specifically to the company that you mentioned in this issue.\u201d The rough transcript also contains ellipses at three points where Mr. Trump is speaking. Colonel Vindman told investigators that at the point of the transcript where the third set of ellipses appears, Mr. Trump said there were tapes of Mr. Biden. Mr. Trump\u2019s mention of tapes is an apparent reference to Mr. Biden\u2019s comments at a January 2018 event about his effort to get Ukraine to force out its prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin. Supporters of Mr. Biden have said Mr. Shokin was widely criticized for his lax anti-corruption efforts. Republicans charge, without evidence, that Mr. Biden was trying to stop an investigation into his son. Colonel Vindman told House investigators Tuesday that he twice registered internal objections about how Mr. Trump and his inner circle were pressuring Ukraine to undertake inquiries beneficial to the president, including of Mr. Biden. After the July 25 call, the colonel reported what happened to a superior, explaining that \u201cI did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government\u2019s support of Ukraine,\u201d according to his opening remarks. He added, \u201cThis would all undermine U.S. national security.\u201d He also described confronting Gordon D. Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union, after the envoy pressed Ukrainian officials to help the Trump administration by investigating the Biden family. The colonel said he acted out of a \u201csense of duty,\u201d and emphasized his military service in his remarks. \u201cI am a patriot,\u201d he said, \u201cand it is my sacred duty and honor to advance and defend our country irrespective of party or politics.\u201d As he spoke, House leaders were preparing for what was expected to be significant new private testimony from current and former White House officials in the coming days. On Wednesday, they will hear from two Ukraine experts who advised Kurt D. Volker, the former United States special envoy to the country. On Thursday, Timothy Morrison, the National Security Council\u2019s Russia and Europe director, is scheduled to testify. And on Friday, investigators have called Robert Blair, a top national security adviser to Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff. There is no recording of the July 25 call by the American side. The White House uses note-takers listening in on the call as well as voice recognition software to create a rough transcript that is a close approximation of the call. But names and technical terms are frequently missed by the software, according to people familiar with the matter. After the call, Colonel Vindman was given a hard copy of the rough transcript to make updates and corrections, according to a person familiar with the matter. Colonel Vindman went through the transcript, made changes and gave his written edits to his boss, Mr. Morrison, according to the person. But after the call, Colonel Vindman went with his brother, a lawyer on the National Security Council staff, to see John A. Eisenberg, the council\u2019s legal adviser, to raise his concerns about the conversation. Colonel Vindman declined to detail to investigators his discussions with Mr. Eisenberg, citing attorney-client privilege, according to two of the people familiar with the testimony. One explanation for why Colonel Vindman\u2019s changes were not made could be that the transcript had been quickly placed into a highly secure computer system, the N.S.C. Intelligence Collaboration Environment, or NICE system, making it more difficult to alter. Mr. Eisenberg ordered the transcript moved to ensure that people who were not assigned to handle Ukraine policy could not read the transcript, a decision he hoped would prevent gossip and leaks about the call. Putting the transcript in the secure server would have made it more difficult to make further edits to the document, and in the case of the July call effectively stopped additional changes. Mr. Eisenberg made the decision without consulting with his supervisor, Pat A. Cipollone, the White House counsel. A White House review of the handling of the call is examining if Mr. Eisenberg acted properly in securing the notes. Administration officials have said a number of calls between Mr. Trump and foreign leaders were put in the most secure server. But tightened security had been put in place for those calls ahead of time. The Ukraine call was put in the secure server only after the fact. In the whistle-blower complaint that was made public, the C.I.A. officer wrote that placing the rough transcript in the server was part of an effort to lock it down, restrict access and a sign that \u201cWhite House officials understood the gravity of what had transpired in the call.\u201d",

      "author": "Stephanie Saul",
      "content": " In a wide-ranging \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview that aired Sunday, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. declared himself the Democratic front-runner, defended his son\u2019s foreign business dealings and explained why it was critical for the country\u2019s future to defeat President Trump in 2020. \u201cWhat I am worried about is the country,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cFour years of Donald Trump will be very hard to overcome, but we can. Eight years of Donald Trump will fundamentally change the nature of who we are as a country. And it\u2019ll take a generation, a generation or more for us to get back on track.\u201d Making a pitch for his presidential bid as the nomination contest tightens, Mr. Biden emphasized his experience. \u201cI think, as I said, we need somebody who, on day one, knows exactly what to do, can command the world stage,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cNo one wonders whether I know a great deal about these issues and foreign policy and domestic policy. They\u2019re things I\u2019ve done.\u201d Noting that the president calls Mr. Biden \u201cSleepy Joe,\u201d the \u201c60 Minutes\u201d anchor Norah O\u2019Donnell said some people worried about whether Mr. Biden was \u201cquick enough\u201d to defend himself against Mr. Trump. \u201cWhat they\u2019re really trying to make the case is about age,\u201d said Mr. Biden, who will turn 77 in November. \u201cAnd with age comes experience, with experience comes wisdom, and with wisdom comes judgment.\u201d The CBS interview with Ms. O\u2019Donnell, taped at Mr. Biden\u2019s Delaware home days earlier, marked his first major network sit-down since Mr. Trump, 73, launched attacks on the international business dealings of Mr. Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden. Revelations that the president had pressured Ukrainian authorities to investigate the Bidens prompted the impeachment inquiry that Mr. Trump now faces in the House of Representatives. Asked why Mr. Biden did not tell his son to avoid a role in the Ukrainian gas company Burisma for fear it might appear improper, Mr. Biden said, \u201cHe was already on the board. And he\u2019s a grown man. And it turns out he did not do a single thing wrong, as everybody\u2019s investigated.\u201d Mr. Biden added that he had never discussed business with his children. \u201cThey know where I have to do my job and that\u2019s it and they have to make their own judgments,\u201d he said. Taking aim at Mr. Trump\u2019s family, Mr. Biden said, \u201cLook, I wasn\u2019t raised to go after the children. Their actions speak for themselves,\u201d adding, \u201cIf I\u2019m president, get elected president, my children are not going to have offices in the White House. My children are not going to sit in on cabinet meetings,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cIt\u2019s just simply improper because you should make it clear to the American public that everything you\u2019re doing is for them,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cAnd the idea that you\u2019re going to have his children, his son-in-law, et cetera, engaged in the day-to-day operation of things they know nothing about.\u201d The president\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, should not be negotiating Middle East peace, Mr. Biden said. \u201cWhat credentials does he bring to that?\u201d With little more than three months until the first caucus, in Iowa, most national public polls show Mr. Biden leading his top opponents, Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, although one poll recently placed Ms. Warren at the head of the pack. Asked whether he was worried that his opponents were exciting young voters by offering dramatic change, Mr. Biden said that while he wants young people engaged, older voters \u2014 a demographic in which Mr. Biden has considerable support \u2014 will ultimately control the outcome of the nomination race. \u201cOverwhelmingly, people over the age of 50 vote in these primaries,\u201d Mr. Biden said. He also took aim at his rivals for what he called far-reaching assertions. \u201cI mean, let\u2019s talk about \u2018Medicare for all,\u2019\u201d he said of the single-player health system that Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders support. \u201cDo you think there\u2019s been any truth in advertising on that? It\u2019s going to raise taxes on middle class people, not just wealthy people.\u201d Mr. Biden proposes a plan that would build on the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, maintaining a public option for those who need it. Ms. Warren\u2019s recent advance \u2014 combined with the fund-raising difficulties of Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign \u2014 have left some of his supporters worried. Expressing optimism, Mr. Biden said, \u201cI know I\u2019m the front-runner,\u201d adding that he wasn\u2019t concerned about money. \u201cWe\u2019re on a course to do extremely well,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cI\u2019m not \u2014 I\u2019m not worried about being able to fund this campaign.\u201d In the last fund-raising quarter, his campaign said it had only $9 million cash in hand, far less than that of his key rivals. But Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign recently reversed course on its longstanding opposition to the assistance of super PACs, opening the door for wealthy supporters to spend unlimited amounts of money to assist his Democratic primary candidacy. Mr. Biden was pressed by a CBS News reporter on this reversal after a campaign event in Durham, N.C., also Sunday night, and the former vice president pointed to the barrage of attack ads he has faced from Mr. Trump\u2019s allies. \u201cI learned after the fact from, from my folks, there are a lot of people who said, \u2018We can\u2019t let this stand,\u2019\u201d he said \u201cThey are able to do that. I haven\u2019t discouraged them from doing it, but I haven\u2019t encouraged it either. I\u2019ve just stayed away. Hands off. But if I\u2019m the nominee and if I win, I promise you I\u2019m going to continue to push for a constitutional amendment to make sure that there\u2019s public funding of elections.\u201d During his \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview, Ms. O\u2019Donnell also hammered Mr. Biden about his debate gaffes. While he acknowledged that the Democratic debates had presented a \u201clearning curve\u201d for him, his wife, Dr. Jill Biden, who sat in on part of the interview, expressed confidence that the public would overlook them. \u201cThe American people know who Joe Biden is,\u201d Dr. Biden said. \u201cI mean, if he misspeaks one word \u2014 that doesn\u2019t affect the way they\u2019re going to vote, one way or the other.\u201d When Ms. O\u2019Donnell asked Dr. Biden whether she had observed any \u201cchange in his ability to communicate in recent years,\u201d she laughed, \u201cNo. Not at all.\u201d ",

      "author": "Sydney Ember",
      "content": "  DES MOINES \u2014 Displaying a new assertiveness toward her Democratic opponents, Elizabeth Warren laced into her chief political rivals, warning on Friday night that the country was in a \u201ctime of crisis\u201d and arguing that Democrats would lose in 2020 if they nominated \u201canyone who comes on this stage and tells you they can make change without a fight.\u201d Speaking to thunderous applause during the party\u2019s biggest Iowa political event of the year, Ms. Warren denounced candidates in the presidential race who opposed bold ideas in favor of more moderate solutions, in veiled attacks on Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Pete Buttigieg. \u201cFear and complacency does not win elections,\u201d she said at the Iowa Democratic Party\u2019s fund-raising dinner. \u201cHope and courage wins elections. I\u2019m not running some consultant-driven campaign with some vague ideas that are designed not to offend anyone.\u201d Befitting her front-runner status, Ms. Warren was the target of heated attacks from three of the first five speakers on the stage: Mr. Biden, Mr. Buttigieg and Kamala Harris. None of the candidates mentioned one another by name, though Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg both presented themselves as more capable of uniting the country. \u201cWe will fight when we must fight but I will never allow us to get so wrapped up in the fighting that we start to think that fighting is the point,\u201d Mr. Buttigieg said. Mr. Biden, who spoke directly after Mr. Buttigieg, extended the theme, saying, \u201cIf you can\u2019t bring the country together we\u2019re in real, real, real trouble.\u201d Even Ms. Harris, whose campaign is lagging to the point that she may not qualify for the party\u2019s December debate, attacked Ms. Warren personally for the first time. \u201cI\u2019ve only had one client in my life \u2014 the people,\u201d Ms. Harris said of her career as a prosecutor. \u201cUnlike others, I\u2019ve never represented a corporation.\u201d The sharp exchanges underscored the urgency motivating the candidates as the race enters its final phase ahead of the Iowa caucuses three months from now. The dinner occurred on one of the most consequential days of the race so far, with Ms. Warren, under pressure from other candidates over how she would pay for \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d finally introducing a long-awaited, $20.5 trillion proposal that immediately drew a fierce attack from her chief rival, Mr. Biden. Mr. Biden declared that under his health care plan, there would be \u201cno increase in taxes for the middle class. None, none, none,\u201d a shot at Ms. Warren\u2019s delay in articulating whether such taxpayers would see tax increases. Instead, Mr. Biden promised an opportunity to \u201cbuy into a Medicare-like proposal.\u201d The Biden, Buttigieg and Warren campaigns each bought large sections of the 16,000-seat Wells Fargo Arena here for supporters to cheer on their candidates. Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s section was particularly enthusiastic, clapping thundersticks and waving flashing lights throughout his address. Ms. Warren\u2019s fans were also spirited, unfurling a banner during her speech with the words, \u201cWin with Warren.\u201d Bernie Sanders, while speaking at the event, brought no supporters, electing to lead them in a march outside instead, part of a pattern of the independent senator\u2019s antipathy toward Democratic Party functions. At the same time, the candidates have been wooing voters with bus tours, rallies and town hall-style events. Ms. Harris, the California senator who is trying to revive her campaign, has taken to cooking Sunday night dinners in supporters\u2019 homes and plans to spend Thanksgiving in the state. The surge in attention on Iowa coincides with a more contentious phase of the race, marked by aggressive campaigning and an increased willingness to go on the offensive. Mr. Sanders, the senator from Vermont, and Mr. Biden, the former vice president, have resumed their attacks on each other, with back-and-forth sniping in the last week about Medicare for all and super PACs. Mr. Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar have shown an increased willingness to go after Ms. Warren, the senator from Massachusetts. Hours before the dinner was to begin, Former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas announced the end of his presidential campaign. His departure was so sudden that supporters had already planted scores of his signature black-and-white campaign signs outside the arena. Lower-tier candidates looking to energize their campaigns have also been more pugnacious: Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, for instance, has amped up her criticisms of the Democratic National Committee, the news media and even Hillary Clinton, who is not in the race. But nowhere has the battle been more intense than at the event on Friday, with candidates trading barbs less on specific policies, and more on political ideology. \u201cWe need big ideas, and here\u2019s the critical part: We need to be willing to fight for them,\u201d Ms. Warren said. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to give up on a big idea, but when we give up on big ideas, we give up on the people whose lives would be touched by those ideas.\u201d Of the top-tier candidates, only Mr. Sanders \u2014 the sole candidate to stand stationary and speak from note on a lectern \u2014 did not attack his opponents, instead delivering a version of his standard stump speech that championed the working class and took aim at corporate interests and the rich. He quoted Franklin D. Roosevelt and Nelson Mandela and provided pleas for his signature policy proposals, including \u201cMedicare for all\u201d and tuition-free public college. He also announced his campaign was donating $20,000 to the Iowa Democratic Party in a symbolic show of solidarity even as he continues to eschew traditional party politicking. The crowded and diverse field \u2014 there are still 17 candidates \u2014 has proved challenging for contenders outside the top tier. While nine have qualified for the party\u2019s November debate in Atlanta, just four are guaranteed a spot for the December debate in Los Angeles. A poll taken this week of likely caucusgoers by The New York Times and Siena College shows the top four candidates locked in an extraordinarily tight race. Ms. Warren held a narrow advantage, with the support of 22 percent of voters, while Mr. Sanders drew 19 percent and Mr. Buttigieg 18 percent. Mr. Biden, who entered the race as a front-runner, had the backing of 17 percent of likely caucusgoers, much weaker than his position in national polls. For Democrats who had been inclined to support Mr. Biden but now find themselves shopping around, that means the moderate choices are limited to Mr. Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., and Ms. Klobuchar, the senator from Minnesota, with other would-be options like Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey falling out of the conversation. Susan Swift, a 58-year-old yoga teacher from Dubuque, said at a Biden event Wednesday that even after watching nine months of campaigning she was still trying to decipher the field. Ms. Swift said she liked the former vice president for \u201chis experience,\u201d but had become more impressed with Mr. Buttigieg the more she had seen him. \u201cDid you see the pluck that that guy had in the last debate?\u201d she said. \u201cSeriously? I was like, \u2018You just won my heart.\u2019\u201d Conversations this week with 24 of Iowa\u2019s 99 Democratic county leaders revealed moderate Democrats moving from Mr. Biden toward Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Klobuchar, who the county officials said had benefited from strong debate performances and repeated trips to the state. Mr. Sanders, who fought Mrs. Clinton to a draw in Iowa four years ago, has struggled to retain support in the party\u2019s most liberal pockets. Some of his anti-establishment backers have gravitated to candidates even more outside the mainstream, like the entrepreneur Andrew Yang and Ms. Gabbard. Zach Simonson, the Democratic chairman in Wapello County, backed Mr. Sanders in 2016 and said he was now torn between Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren. \u201cI was all in for Bernie in 2016, but with Warren in the race, some of the weaker parts of his candidacy are magnified,\u201d Mr. Simonson said. \u201cHe\u2019s got a very reasonable critique of the national Democratic Party institution, but from campaigning so much on the outside, I don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll be ready to take the role of national standard-bearer for all Democrats after the convention.\u201d ",

What we don\u2019t know: A lot, still.By Giovanni RussonelloPRINT EDITIONPoll Puts Four in a Tie, With Many Iowa Voters Still Open to Persuasion|November 3, 2019, Page A19",
      "author": "Giovanni Russonello",
      "content": " Senator Elizabeth Warren is starting to stand out in Iowa, as Friday\u2019s New York Times/Siena College poll shows. But she isn\u2019t standing alone \u2014\u00a0at least not yet. With the candidacy of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. cooling off, the race now looks more interesting than at any point since campaigning in Iowa began intensifying over the summer. Here are a few major takeaways from the poll. The Iowa poll demonstrated that Ms. Warren has strength in Iowa, and room to grow \u2014\u00a0but she has not quite broken out of the pack. All four of the top candidates \u2014 Ms. Warren, Mr. Biden, Senator Bernie Sanders and Mayor Pete Buttigieg \u2014\u00a0are technically locked in a statistical tie, according to the poll\u2019s 4.7-point margin of error. Then there\u2019s the fact that 65 percent of Iowa voters who named a first-choice candidate said they could still be persuaded to caucus for someone else. While Ms. Warren is at the top of the crowded bunch with 23 percent of the overall vote, only about a quarter of her supporters are certain they\u2019ll caucus for her\u00a0on Feb. 3. That said, there is evidence to suggest that her support is solidifying. Ms. Warren is the second-choice pick of 25 percent of voters with a chosen candidate \u2014 that\u2019s 10 points higher than Mr. Sanders, the runner-up. And she leads among the two-thirds of voters who say they\u2019re paying very close attention to the news; she has 23 percent support from that group, compared to Mr. Sanders\u2019 16 percent. As the caucuses near and attention picks up, she may have a particularly good shot at winning over voters who are just tuning in. With Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign faltering slightly, there are signs hidden within these poll results that he is still relying heavily on name recognition, rather than enthusiasm. He is buoyed by the sense \u2014\u00a0held by four in five Democratic voters \u2014\u00a0that he would have a good chance of beating President Trump in the general election. Slim majorities of Democratic voters say they would prefer a moderate candidate and one who promises to find common ground, rather than a trenchant liberal. But Mr. Buttigieg also polls formidably among these middle-path voters, and he is fast on Mr. Biden\u2019s heels. They are roughly tied for the lead among voters looking for a candidate who will\u00a0seek common ground with political opponents. Meanwhile, Mr. Biden doesn\u2019t command even 10 percent among the liberal Iowa voters that make up the party\u2019s core. Only 2 percent of voters underage 45 said they would support him. And he draws a good deal of his backing from those who say they have never attended a caucus before, possibly showing that his numbers are being pumped up by respondents who are less engaged\u00a0\u2014 and perhaps, less likely to turn out. Mr. Sanders, who nearly won the Iowa caucuses four years ago,\u00a0stands at 19 percent in the poll, revealing that he has held onto a durable \u2014 but diminished \u2014 following. Ms. Warren has already swept up support among what was once his most solid demographic: young voters. According to the poll, Ms. Warren was the choice of a whopping 38 percent of voters under 30, compared to 29 percent for Mr. Sanders. But neither of them has been able to capture even one out of every five voters age 45 and over. Ms. Warren seems to have annexed much of Mr. Sanders\u2019 support among very liberal caucusgoers; she now has 37 percent of them in her corner, compared to 28 percent for him. Not all of the Democratic voters who are gravitating toward Ms. Warren express passion for each element of her progressive agenda. Two-thirds strongly back the idea of a public health care option, and a majority \u2014\u00a057 percent \u2014\u00a0also strongly support increasing Social Security benefits. But there is less widespread enthusiasm for some of the boldest progressive proposals that Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders have put forth. Just one-third of Democratic voters expressed strong support for giving free college tuition to all Americans, and only 43 percent strongly believe the big banks and tech companies should be broken up. Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s and Mr. Biden\u2019s backers tend not to be enthusiastic about those ideas. Yet Ms. Warren has managed to assemble an ideologically diverse coalition. Though her supporters generally skew liberal, most of\u00a0them don\u2019t feel strongly about eliminating college tuition, and almost half don\u2019t express strong support for breaking up banks and tech companies. Health care has been the most discussed issue of the primary season, with Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren advocating a \u201cMedicare for all\u201d bill and more moderate candidates calling for a public option. The poll found that most Democratic voters in Iowa are open to a single payer-type plan, but a majority would prefer a candidate who seeks to strengthen the Affordable Care Act and add a public option. While Mr. Sanders\u2019 Iowa supporters are united in their desire for a single-payer health care system, Ms. Warren brings together a broader spectrum: Barely over half of her voters feel strongly about getting rid of private insurance. This suggests that Ms. Warren has room to grow among the substantial share of voters who are less interested in Medicare for all, and who have not yet settled on a final candidate choice. It is impossible to say just how many voters will actually turn out in a primary, or which groups will vote in the greatest numbers. At caucuses, which are more sparsely attended, it\u2019s especially hard to know. So, remember that like all the pre-election surveys that you\u2019ll see in the coming months, the results of this one were dictated in part by how our team defined the probable electorate. Add in the complex set of rules governing the Iowa caucuses \u2014 where backers of less-popular candidates will eventually have to throw their support to someone else on the night of the election \u2014 and it all adds up to a lot of uncertainty. This poll is nothing more than our attempt at a snapshot of where things are at, three months out. Besides that, Iowa\u2019s voters are more than 90 percent white, so the results of this poll carry only the faintest of implications about how the race will play out in the rest of the country. After Iowa\u2019s caucuses and the first primary a week later, in heavily white New Hampshire, the importance of the party\u2019s nonwhite electorate \u2014 particularly black and Hispanic voters \u2014 will come back into the foreground. From late February through Super Tuesday on March 3, the focus will be on major contests in Southern and Western states.",

      "content": " The top Democratic presidential candidates are locked in a close race in the 2020 Iowa caucuses, with Senator Elizabeth Warren slightly ahead of Senator Bernie Sanders, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., according to a New York Times/Siena College poll of likely Democratic caucusgoers. Ms. Warren appears to have solidified her gains in the first voting state while Mr. Buttigieg has climbed quickly to catch up with Mr. Sanders and overtake Mr. Biden, the onetime front-runner. Ms. Warren is drawing support from 22 percent of likely caucusgoers, while Mr. Sanders is at 19 percent, followed by Mr. Buttigieg at 18 percent and Mr. Biden at 17 percent. The survey is full of alarming signs for Mr. Biden, who entered the race in April at the top of the polls in Iowa and nationally. He is still in the lead in most national polls, but his comparatively weak position in the earliest primary and caucus states now presents a serious threat to his candidacy. With the Iowa caucuses just three months away, Mr. Biden\u2019s unsteadiness appears to have opened a path in the race for other Democrats closer to the political middle, particularly Mr. Buttigieg. The poll reveals a race in flux but not in disarray, framed by a stark debate about the direction of the Democratic Party and by a degree of fluidity arising from Mr. Biden\u2019s travails. In the early states, at least, the former vice president appears to be buckling on one side to the expansive populism of Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders, and on the other to Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s calls for generational change. While no single candidate has a decisive advantage, the strongest currents in the party appear to be swirling around candidates promising in different ways to challenge the existing political and economic order. Several of them would also represent change by virtue of their identities, including Ms. Warren, who would be the first female president, and Mr. Buttigieg, who is gay. But despite the historic diversity of the field, all the top candidates are white. In Iowa, a state that helped vault Barack Obama into the presidency, the poll found a substantial bloc concerned that anyone other than a heterosexual white man might struggle to defeat President Trump. The survey found Iowa Democrats in a divided and perhaps indecisive state about what the party must do in order to deny Mr. Trump a second term. They are an ideologically mixed group, with younger voters trending to the left and leaning strongly toward Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders. Mr. Biden remains the favorite candidate of older voters, but only 2 percent of respondents under 45 years old said they currently plan to caucus for him. The caucuses are Feb. 3. In the poll, large majorities were supportive of ambitious liberal policy goals, like breaking up big banks, increasing Social Security benefits and implementing single-payer health care. But perhaps out of political caution, the poll also found that more Democrats would prefer to nominate someone who supports improving the private health insurance system rather than replacing it altogether. And most Democrats said they would favor a nominee willing to work with Republicans. There is still plenty of room for shifts in political momentum: Two-thirds of likely caucusgoers in The Times poll said they could still be persuaded to change their minds. Outside the top tier of four candidates, the best-performing Democrat was Senator Amy Klobuchar, supported by 4 percent of respondents, followed by Senator Kamala Harris and Andrew Yang, both at 3 percent, and Senator Cory Booker, Representative Tulsi Gabbard and Tom Steyer, all at 2 percent. The Iowa caucuses are a fairly arcane institution that differs from a standard primary election. They traditionally require Democrats to gather at myriad locations around the state for a multiround process in which voters group themselves behind their first-choice candidate; if a candidate registers less than 15 percent support, their supporters can reallocate themselves to other candidates. Factoring in voters\u2019 second choices, Ms. Warren had the broadest appeal: She is the first or second preference of 47 percent of Iowa Democrats, with two-thirds of Sanders supporters naming her as their backup choice. Mr. Sanders is the first or second choice of 34 percent of likely caucusgoers, followed by Mr. Buttigieg at 31 percent. Mr. Biden was in fourth place by this measure, at 28 percent; only 1 in 10 voters named him as their second choice. The Times/Siena survey of 439 Iowa Democratic caucusgoers was conducted from Oct. 25-30 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.7 percentage points. Here are the full results and the methodology for the poll. One issue that occasions little division among Democrats is impeachment. Eighty-nine percent of people in the poll said they support impeaching Mr. Trump and removing him from office. Most Iowa Democrats in the poll said they were somewhat or very confident that the party\u2019s top candidates would beat Mr. Trump in the general election. There was no difference in how they assessed Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren on that measure, and Mr. Sanders and Mr. Buttigieg fared only slightly worse. The confidence Iowa Democrats expressed in Ms. Warren as a general-election candidate could represent something of a turning point for her candidacy, if she can extend the sentiment to other early states. For much of the race, even Democratic voters who have embraced her ideas and political persona have harbored reservations about her odds against Mr. Trump. In Iowa, that appears to have changed. Jonathan Morrison, 45, of Mason City, said he was drawn to Ms. Warren because of her grasp of economic issues and believed she would \u201chold her own\u201d against the president. \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s going to allow herself to be pushed around or bullied by Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s going to stick to the facts and call him out on his policies.\u201d Mr. Morrison, who said he is a drone pilot in the oil and gas industry, said he also liked Mr. Buttigieg, whom he described as having a \u201cleadership aura about him.\u201d \u201cI think Pete Buttigieg is going to be president someday,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure it\u2019s this time around.\u201d Both Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders appear to be tapping into a thirst among many primary voters for transformational policies rather than incremental improvements in governance. But the presence of two forceful, well-funded populists in the race may be preventing either Mr. Sanders or Ms. Warren from gaining a wide advantage. They have assembled somewhat different political coalitions: Ms. Warren is the top choice of younger voters, women and people with college degrees, while Mr. Sanders fares better with men and people with high school degrees or less. He also retains significant backing from young people, and his supporters are the least likely to say they might change their minds before February. Though Mr. Buttigieg would be the youngest president ever, he is not exceptionally popular with his generational cohort. He fared somewhat better with older voters than younger ones; like Ms. Warren, he registered strongly among people with college and postgraduate degrees. Mr. Biden\u2019s support comes almost exclusively from older voters: Among people 65 years or older, he is still the front-runner, with backing from nearly a third of them. But he has negligible support among younger Iowans. With voters under 45, Mr. Biden is polling several points behind Mr. Yang, a former tech executive who has never run for office before. An ideological gulf, running along generational lines, is a major feature of the Democratic race. Two-thirds of voters under 30 favored either Ms. Warren or Mr. Sanders, while a smaller majority of people over 65 favored either Mr. Biden or Mr. Buttigieg. An overwhelming 85 percent of voters under 30 said they preferred a nominee promising fundamental change over one seeking to restore normalcy in Washington. Among voters more than 65 years old, 7 in 10 preferred a candidate who would bring back normalcy. William Nix of Waterloo, Iowa, is among the young voters torn between several candidates promising large-scale change. He said he had long admired Mr. Sanders but worried that he might pull out of the race after his recent heart attack. Mr. Nix, who is 21 and works on an assembly line at John Deere, said he was considering Ms. Warren and Mr. Buttigieg, and wanted a nominee focused on economic inequality and access to education. \u201cI\u2019m really all for making going to college more affordable,\u201d Mr. Nix said. \u201cThat is my biggest thing, because I want to go to college myself.\u201d Most Iowa Democrats appear to believe it is easier for candidates who are heterosexual, white, male and ideologically moderate to win presidential races, though that assessment is not playing a decisive role in shaping their caucus preferences. Most poll respondents said they believed it would be harder to win the election with a nominee who is more liberal than most Democrats, or one who is gay. About half expressed those reservations about a female nominee, and 4 in 10 were pessimistic about an African-American candidate These reservations about embracing the diversity of their presidential field have not translated into enthusiasm for Mr. Biden. One reason may be his age: A majority of respondents said they believed it would be harder to win the election with a candidate over the age of 75. Both Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders would turn 80 within a year or two of taking office. Julia Roberts, a voter in Winterset, Iowa, is among those wary of nominating someone whose identity could unsettle rural conservatives. Ms. Roberts, 60, a retired state employee, favored Mr. Biden because she saw him as the strongest general-election candidate and valued his foreign policy experience. \u201cI think, really, he\u2019s got the best chance of beating Trump,\u201d Ms. Roberts said, adding that she also liked Ms. Warren and Mr. Buttigieg but feared there would be \u201cprejudice in play\u201d against them.  Tonda Hadden, 63, of Council Bluffs, Iowa, said she had originally favored Mr. Biden or Mr. Sanders. But she worried Mr. Sanders was \u201ctoo old and too left.\u201d With Mr. Biden, she had grown \u201ca little worried about his gaffes.\u201d Ms. Hadden said she was now \u201cstill looking\u201d over her options: She named Ms. Warren as her current favorite and Mr. Buttigieg as an intriguing alternative. And she said she hoped some others, like Mr. Booker, whom she saw interviewed Wednesday on \u201cThe View,\u201d would get a closer look from voters. \u201cI really like him,\u201d she said of Mr. Booker, \u201cand I don\u2019t understand why he\u2019s not up in the polls.\u201d",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 For weeks, lawmakers and witnesses have been striding past reporters in the basement of the Capitol Visitor Center to enter a room marked \u201cRESTRICTED AREA,\u201d the secure chamber where administration officials have been testifying confidentially in the impeachment inquiry into President Trump. On Monday and Tuesday, the public got its first glimpse into what the inquiry sounds and feels like when Democrats leading the investigation into Mr. Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine released the first four transcripts of their so-far secret interviews. The more than 1,000 pages of material offered a rare, detailed peek inside the lengthy sessions, giving a sense of both the dullness and the drama that have characterized the proceedings. The transcripts \u2014 two were released on Monday and two more on Tuesday \u2014 are the leading edge of the new, public phase of the impeachment inquiry, which will soon move to televised hearings that aim to lay out Democrats\u2019 case that the president abused his power to enlist a foreign country\u2019s help in smearing his political opponents. The House Intelligence Committee posted on its website on Monday a 317-page transcript of the testimony by Marie L. Yovanovitch, the ousted former ambassador to Ukraine, and a 156-page transcript of the questioning of Michael McKinley, a former senior adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. On Tuesday, it added a 360-page transcript for Kurt D. Volker, the president\u2019s former Ukraine envoy, and a 375-page transcript of the testimony given by Gordon D. Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union. Taken together, they painted a picture of hours of mind-numbingly detailed questions about meetings and memos, punctuated by occasional moments of emotion and bursts of legal sparring between Republicans and Democrats. They reveal that Republicans \u2014 who have complained publicly of being frozen out of the inquiry \u2014 have in fact been availing themselves aggressively of the equal time they are provided to question witnesses. And they provide a minute-by-minute account of how Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the chairman of the intelligence panel, has been working to build the narrative at the heart of the inquiry \u2014 that Mr. Trump improperly pressed Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son Hunter Biden, as well as conspiracy theories that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 presidential campaign. The questions and answers reveal the methodical approach that Mr. Schiff and other members have taken toward coaxing information out of their witnesses. Mr. Schiff, a former federal prosecutor, often asks wide-ranging questions that appear meant to lead to sweeping statements by the witnesses. The committee\u2019s lawyers then follow up with a series of detailed questions about the timing of the events in question. At times, the transcripts reveal, Mr. Schiff\u2019s lawyers grew exasperated with answers from the witnesses. In one exchange, a Democratic questioner repeatedly pressed Mr. Sondland to admit that he knew that Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, was eager to have Ukraine conduct investigations into the Bidens. \u201cYou were completely oblivious?\u201d the incredulous questioner asked after presenting Mr. Sondland with media appearances and social media postings in which Mr. Giuliani described his intentions about Ukraine. Later, under friendlier Republican questioning, Mr. Sondland explained his ignorance by saying he had too many \u201ccables and other things to read\u201d to pay attention to Mr. Giuliani. Asked if he watched Mr. Giuliani\u2019s appearances on the TV, he added, \u201cI watch HB0.\u201d The transcripts indicate that, despite repeated claims that they have been prevented from taking part in the impeachment inquiry, Republican members have spent many hours questioning witnesses. In some cases, the Republican members pressed the diplomats on detailed points of inquiry. In others, they used their time behind closed doors to criticize the impeachment process or to challenge the integrity of the witnesses. At the beginning of Mr. McKinley\u2019s interview, Republican lawmakers used their opening statements to lash out at the inquiry, making the same arguments about an unfair process behind closed doors that they later delivered to scrums of reporters after leaving the sessions. \u201cDemocrats are conducting a rushed, closed-door and unprecedented inquiry,\u201d Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio, complained in one session. Before the interview of Mr. McKinley could begin, Representative Lee Zeldin, Republican of New York, questioned \u201cwhat specific provision of House rules\u201d gives the committee the right to interview diplomats in the first place. And Representative Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina, griped about leaks. \u201cObviously, we\u2019ve talked about confidentiality in here,\u201d he said, according to the transcript. \u201cI am assuming that, based on the releases that some of my Democrat colleagues were quoted in various newspaper articles yesterday with specific facts that came from the hearing yesterday, that those releases are not deemed a breach of House rules.\u201d Well into Mr. Sondland\u2019s testimony, it was clear that relations between the Republican and Democratic lawmakers had frayed. Mr. Meadows accused Mr. Schiff of \u201cleading the witness over and over and over again,\u201d prompting an angry retort by the chairman. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to this witness to ask him if he is aware of facts which are not, in fact, facts,\u201d Mr. Schiff shot back. Later, a squabble over how long it took Mr. Sondland to turn over WhatsApp messages to the State Department devolved into a heated argument in which Mr. Meadows complained that \u201cit is nine hours and now we\u2019re getting into this kind of crap.\u201d The House voted on a resolution last week that directed the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight and Reform Committees to release the transcripts with necessary redactions and begin to move other findings into public view. Democrats could begin public hearings with some of the witnesses as soon as next week. The transcripts follow a standard set of rules that Mr. Schiff put in place for the interviews: Democrats, who control the committee, start off the questioning for an hour, followed by an hour of questions from the Republican side. The two sides continue to take turns until the interviews are over. During Ms. Yovanovitch\u2019s testimony, lawyers for Republican members repeatedly pressed her about whether she leaked a copy of her opening statement to the news media, prompting howls of protest from her lawyer: \u201cAnything she would know about that, she would know through counsel, so she\u2019s not going to answer that,\u201d her lawyer said repeatedly. When Ms. Yovanovitch\u2019s lawyer objected to another Republican question, Mr. Meadows appeared to grow frustrated, suggesting that the lawyer objected only when it was Republicans\u2019 turn to question. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s amazing, every hour you wake up, every other hour you wake up,\u201d Mr. Meadows said. The transcripts of the four witnesses are filled with mostly dry testimony, reflecting the bureaucratic roles that they held in the Trump administration. And the dialogue between the witnesses and their inquisitors is sometimes interrupted by requests that people speak more clearly into the microphones or answer more clearly. \u201cSorry, you need to say, \u2018Yes,\u2019\u201d a committee lawyer instructed Ms. Yovanovitch at one point after she answered a question with \u201cuh-huh,\u201d an admonition he had to repeat several times. But the characters at issue \u2014 Mr. Giuliani; Mr. Pompeo; and the president himself \u2014 and the unfiltered descriptions of their actions make for gripping reading. Ms. Yovanovitch apparently grew upset as she recalled the allegations that led to her ouster, including a conversation in which John Sullivan, the deputy secretary of state, told her she was being recalled from Ukraine because Mr. Trump had lost confidence in her. \u201cWell, you know, I expressed my dismay and my disappointment,\u201d she said, according to the transcript. \u201cI asked him what this meant for our policy, what was the message that \u2014 \u201d \u201cDo you want to take a minute?\u201d Daniel Goldman, the chief Democratic lawyer, asked her. \u201cYeah, just a minute,\u201d she said. But amid the tense exchanges, there were moments of levity as lawmakers sometimes appeared to grow stir crazy inside the basement suite after hours of questions and answers. \u201cJust to let members know, we are going to turn the air back on,\u201d Mr. Schiff said about six hours into Ms. Yovanovitch\u2019s testimony. \u201cIt\u2019s feast or famine here, and we\u2019re \u2014 my staff tells me it started to smell like a locker room in here. So, we\u2019ll turn it over to the minority and we\u2019ll turn the air back on.\u201d",

A Republican donor from Long Island put up the money.By Kenneth P.

      "author": "Kenneth P. Vogel",
      "content": "   WASHINGTON \u2014 It has been one of the enduring mysteries of the impeachment drama: Where did a cash-strapped Ukrainian-born American businessman get $500,000 to pay President Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani? It turns out that the money came from a Long Island lawyer named Charles Gucciardo, a Republican donor and supporter of Mr. Trump. The payment was part of a deal in which Mr. Gucciardo would become an investor in a company started by the businessman, Lev Parnas, according to Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Gucciardo\u2019s lawyer and other people familiar with the arrangement. The money, paid to Mr. Giuliani\u2019s firm in September and October 2018, cemented a relationship between Mr. Parnas and Mr. Giuliani. Within months that relationship would evolve into a critical front in the campaign by the president and Mr. Giuliani to pressure the Ukrainian government to start investigations that would benefit Mr. Trump politically. Mr. Gucciardo, 62, a plaintiff\u2019s lawyer, has not been implicated in any wrongdoing, and there is no evidence that he was involved in the Ukrainian pressure campaign. Mr. Gucciardo\u2019s lawyer, Randy Zelin, said Mr. Gucciardo invested in the company because of Mr. Giuliani\u2019s involvement. \u201cHe understood that he was investing in a reputable company that Rudolph Giuliani was going to be the spokesman and the face of,\u201d Mr. Zelin said, comparing Mr. Giuliani\u2019s role to the one he had played for the personal data-security company LifeLock, which ran commercials featuring Mr. Giuliani. \u201cWhen you think of cybersecurity, you think of Rudolph Giuliani,\u201d Mr. Zelin said. The company being promoted by Mr. Parnas, Fraud Guarantee, was billed as a way for investors to get insurance against the risk of being defrauded. Mr. Gucciardo\u2019s money was a loan that could be converted into a stake in the company, according to people familiar with the deal. But it is not clear the stake would have any value, since Fraud Guarantee does not appear to have any customers. Mr. Giuliani did not make any commercials for the company or otherwise engage in any public marketing for it. Mr. Parnas, who was arrested last month on federal campaign finance charges, has opened talks with congressional impeachment investigators about his role in the Ukraine pressure campaign. The disclosure that Mr. Gucciardo provided the money that put Mr. Giuliani in business with Mr. Parnas fills in some blanks in a story that has left Mr. Giuliani under federal investigation for possible foreign lobbying violations, and Mr. Trump facing the likelihood of impeachment by the House. The payment is another example of how Mr. Giuliani, a former federal prosecutor and New York mayor who is facing the prospect of a potentially costly divorce, capitalized on the spike in demand for his services after he signed on as Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer in April 2018. And it helps explain how Mr. Parnas came to suggest that he and another Soviet-born South Florida businessman, Igor Fruman, had the blessing of a lawyer for the president of the United States as they pursued business and political ventures around the world, including in Ukraine. In an interview, Mr. Giuliani called the arrangement a \u201cperfectly legitimate payment\u201d for which Mr. Gucciardo received \u201cpromissory notes that were convertible into a percentage of the company.\u201d Mr. Giuliani said he \u201cverified the stock agreement\u201d and \u201cfelt comfortable getting it from somebody as reputable as him,\u201d adding that, after the payments, \u201cI\u2019ve gotten to know Charles very well. He\u2019s a very honorable man, a very good man.\u201d Mr. Zelin said Mr. Gucciardo did not pay Mr. Giuliani personally, but rather made his investment by paying one of Mr. Giuliani\u2019s consulting firms, Giuliani Partners. Mr. Gucciardo was \u201csimply one of numerous other investors in the company and is nothing more than a passive investor,\u201d Mr. Zelin said. Mr. Parnas and his co-founder in Fraud Guarantee, David Correia, as well as Mr. Fruman and another associate, Andrey Kukushkin, were arrested last month on campaign finance charges that included accusations that Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman made illegal donations to a member of Congress allied with them in efforts to remove the United States ambassador to Ukraine. In an interview last month before he was arrested, Mr. Parnas said Mr. Giuliani \u201coffered some advice on\u201d Fraud Guarantee. He said his efforts to help Mr. Trump in Ukraine were self-funded and \u201chave nothing to do with our business.\u201d Joseph A. Bondy, a lawyer for Mr. Parnas, declined to comment, as did a lawyer for Mr. Correia, Jeff Marcus. In 2016, Mr. Gucciardo donated $2,000 to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and the Republican National Committee, and spoke at an event that appears to have taken place at the Trump International Hotel in Washington. In the speech he accused Mr. Trump\u2019s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, of \u201cperpetrating a fraud on the American people,\u201d while saying Mr. Trump had \u201cmade more people, more workers, more money than anybody on Capitol Hill here.\u201d In 2018, he made his biggest donation on record to date \u2014 $50,000 to the pro-Trump super PAC America First Action \u2014 and attended an event for major donors at the Trump hotel featuring appearances by the president and Donald Trump Jr. It was there that he met Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman, who had recently co-founded a company called Global Energy Producers that donated $325,000 to the PAC. The next month, Mr. Parnas, Mr. Fruman and Mr. Gucciardo all went on a group trip to Israel, according to people who traveled with them. \u201cThose two guys were operators and they were definitely trying to rope people into their game, whatever their game was,\u201d said Anthony Scaramucci, who was briefly the White House communications director for Mr. Trump and who was on the Israel trip. He said Mr. Fruman and Mr. Parnas often cited their connections in Mr. Trump\u2019s orbit, and particularly to Mr. Giuliani. Around the time Mr. Parnas returned from the trip, he promised to pay Mr. Giuliani $500,000 to provide what Mr. Giuliani described as \u201ca combination of business advice and consulting, consistent with what my company does, and legal advice.\u201d But Mr. Parnas, whose business ventures had left him with a trail of debts and lawsuits, did not have the cash and feared that if he did not come up with it, he and Mr. Fruman might lose their access to Mr. Giuliani, according to people who know the men. In September 2018, Mr. Gucciardo stepped in, paying Mr. Giuliani $250,000 on behalf of Fraud Guarantee, according to people familiar with the arrangement. Mr. Gucciardo paid the second $250,000 the next month, not long after he saw Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Parnas in Boca Raton, Fla., at a bris ceremony for Mr. Parnas\u2019s son, for whom Mr. Giuliani had agreed to serve as the godfather. By January, Mr. Giuliani had enlisted Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman to collect information and make connections in Ukraine that could be used to damage Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic presidential contender, and to undermine the special counsel\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.",

Sondland recounted how he told Ukrainian officials that military aid was tied to their commitment to investigations President Trump wanted.By Michael S. SchmidtPRINT EDITIONEnvoy Now Tells of Pressing Kiev in a Quid Pro Quo|November 6, 2019, Page A1",
      "author": "Michael S. Schmidt",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 A crucial witness in the impeachment inquiry reversed himself this week and acknowledged to investigators that he had told a top Ukrainian official that the country would most likely have to give President Trump what he wanted \u2014 a public pledge for investigations \u2014 in order to unlock military aid. The disclosure from Gordon D. Sondland, an ally of Mr. Trump who is the United States ambassador to the European Union, confirmed his role in laying out a quid pro quo to Ukraine that conditioned the release of security assistance from the United States on the country\u2019s willingness to say it was investigating former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and other Democrats. That admission, included in a four-page sworn statement released on Tuesday, directly contradicted his testimony to investigators last month, when he said he \u201cnever\u201d thought there was any precondition on the aid. \u201cI said that resumption of the U.S. aid would likely not occur until Ukraine provided the public anticorruption statement that we had been discussing for many weeks,\u201d Mr. Sondland said in the new statement, which was made public by the House committees leading the inquiry, along with the transcript of his original testimony. Mr. Sondland\u2019s disclosure appeared intended to insulate him from accusations that he intentionally misled Congress during his earlier testimony, in which he frequently said he could not recall key details and events under scrutiny by impeachment investigators. It also provided Democrats with a valuable piece of evidence from a critical witness to fill out the picture of their abuse-of-power case against the president. Unlike other officials who have offered damaging testimony about Mr. Trump, Mr. Sondland is a political supporter of the president who has interacted directly with him. The question of a quid pro quo is at the heart of the impeachment investigation into Mr. Trump, which turns on whether the president abused his power when he asked a foreign power to target his political rivals. Mr. Trump initially strongly denied there was any quid pro quo involving Ukraine, and numerous Republicans took up that refrain. But as the inquiry has unfolded, he and Republican lawmakers have gradually begun to move away from that position. Instead they have adopted the argument that a president insisting on a quid pro quo from a foreign government to benefit himself politically may be of concern, but it is not \u2014 in the words of Mr. Trump himself \u2014 \u201can impeachable event.\u201d A wealthy Oregon hotelier who donated to the president\u2019s campaign and was rewarded with his plum diplomatic post, Mr. Sondland can hardly be dismissed as a \u201cNever Trumper,\u201d a charge the president has leveled against many other officials who have offered damning accounts of his conduct with regard to Ukraine. As such, Mr. Sondland\u2019s new, fuller account complicates Republicans\u2019 task in defending the president against the impeachment push. On Tuesday, the White House rejected Mr. Sondland\u2019s new account, saying he failed to cite a \u201csolid source\u201d for his \u201cassumption\u201d that there was a link between the aid and the investigations. \u201cNo amount of salacious media-biased headlines, which are clearly designed to influence the narrative, change the fact that the president has done nothing wrong,\u201d Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary, said in a statement. The new information surfaced as the House committees also released a transcript of their interview last month with Kurt D. Volker, the former special envoy to Ukraine. Rushing to complete their final round of requests for key witnesses before they commence public impeachment hearings, the panels also scheduled testimony on Friday by Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, who quickly said he would not comply. And two more administration witnesses who had been scheduled to testify on Tuesday \u2014 Michael Duffey, a top official in the White House budget office, and Wells Griffith, a senior aide to Energy Secretary Rick Perry \u2014 failed to appear. Mr. Sondland had said in a text message exchange in early September with William B. Taylor Jr., the top American diplomat in Ukraine, that the president had been clear there was no quid pro quo between the aid and investigations of the Bidens. But Mr. Sondland testified last month that he was only repeating what Mr. Trump had told him, leaving open the question of whether he believed the president. His addendum suggested that Mr. Sondland was not completely forthcoming with Mr. Taylor, and that he was, in fact, aware that the aid was contingent on the investigations. In his updated testimony, Mr. Sondland recounted how he had discussed the linkage with Andriy Yermak, a top adviser to President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, on the sidelines of a Sept. 1 meeting between Vice President Mike Pence and Mr. Zelensky in Warsaw. Mr. Zelensky had discussed the suspension of aid with Mr. Pence, Mr. Sondland said. In the addendum, Mr. Sondland said he had \u201crefreshed my recollection\u201d after reading the testimony given by Mr. Taylor and Timothy Morrison, the senior director for Europe and Russia at the National Security Council. Mr. Sondland said he believed that withholding the aid \u2014 a package of $391 million in security assistance that had been approved by Congress and was intended to help Ukraine combat Russian aggression \u2014 was \u201cill advised,\u201d although he did not know \u201cwhen, why or by whom the aid was suspended.\u201d But he said he came to believe that the aid was tied to the investigations. \u201cI presumed that the aid suspension had become linked to the proposed anticorruption statement,\u201d Mr. Sondland said. In his closed-door interview last month, Mr. Sondland portrayed himself as a well-meaning and at times unwitting player who was trying to conduct American foreign policy with Ukraine with the full backing of the State Department while Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyer, repeatedly inserted himself at the behest of the president. He also said repeatedly that he could not remember things, including details about the Sept. 1 meeting, according to the 375-page transcript of his testimony. \u201cAnd you had never thought there was a precondition to the aid?\u201d one of the Republican investigators asked Mr. Sondland. \u201cIs that correct?\u201d \u201cNever,\u201d Mr. Sondland said, adding that he \u201cwas dismayed when it was held up, but I didn\u2019t know why.\u201d In the aftermath of the testimony last month, several Democrats painted Mr. Sondland as a lackey of Mr. Trump\u2019s who had been an agent of the shadow foreign policy on Ukraine, eager to go along with what the president wanted. They contended that Mr. Sondland had deliberately evaded crucial questions during his testimony. Other witnesses have pointed to him as a central player in the irregular channel of Ukraine policymaking being run by Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani, and the instigator of the quid pro quo strategy. Mr. Morrison, the National Security Council official, testified last week that it was Mr. Sondland who first indicated in a conversation with him and Mr. Taylor on Sept. 1 that the release of the military aid might be contingent on the announcement of the investigations, and that he hoped \u201cthat Ambassador Sondland\u2019s strategy was exclusively his own.\u201d Mr. Sondland\u2019s new testimony contradicted the notion that he was a lone wolf pushing the quid pro quo idea himself. Instead it portrayed him as just the messenger who had discovered there was a linkage between the aid and the investigations and who had articulated it to others. He said it \u201cwould have been natural for me to have voiced what I presumed\u201d about what was standing in the way of releasing the military assistance. Mr. Sondland originally testified that Mr. Trump had essentially delegated American foreign policy on Ukraine to Mr. Giuliani, a directive he disagreed with but still followed. He said that it was Mr. Giuliani who demanded the new Ukrainian president commit to the investigations, and that he did not understand until later that the overarching goal may have been to bolster the president\u2019s 2020 election chances. Mr. Sondland said that he went along with what Mr. Giuliani wanted in the hope of pacifying him and restoring normal relations between the two countries.  Mr. Sondland acknowledged believing the statement was linked to a White House visit Mr. Zelensky sought with Mr. Trump. The transcripts released on Tuesday vividly underscore the anger toward Ukraine that fueled Mr. Trump\u2019s demands for investigations into his political rivals. Both Mr. Sondland and Mr. Volker testified that the president complained at a White House meeting on May 23 about his suspicions of Ukrainian efforts to undermine his campaign in 2016. The president said that \u201cUkraine was trying to take him down,\u201d Mr. Sondland said. \u201cThat was what I heard.\u201d Mr. Volker gave a similar account, telling investigators that Mr. Trump had dismissed his positive assessments about Ukraine because of what he was hearing from Mr. Giuliani. \u201cHe gave the example of hearing from Rudy Giuliani that, \u2018They\u2019re all corrupt, they\u2019re all terrible people,\u2019 that they were \u2014 \u2018they tried to take me down\u2019 \u2014 meaning the president in the 2016 election,\u201d Mr. Volker said, according to the 360-page transcript of his interview. On Aug. 13, Mr. Volker sent a text message to Mr. Sondland indicating the precise language that he thought Mr. Zelensky should use in a public statement about investigating corruption. \u201cSpecial attention should be paid to the problem of interference in the political processes of the United States, especially with the alleged involvement of some Ukrainian politicians,\u201d Mr. Volker wrote. \u201cI want to declare that this is unacceptable. We intend to initiate and complete a transparent and unbiased investigation of all available facts and episodes, including those involving Burisma and the 2016 U.S. elections, which in turn will prevent the recurrence of this problem in the future.\u201d Burisma is a Ukrainian energy company that employed Mr. Biden\u2019s son Hunter on its board during Mr. Biden\u2019s vice presidency. The text was intended to be forwarded to Mr. Yermak so that Mr. Zelensky could use the language in his statement, according to the texts released on Tuesday.",

      "content": " Hi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I\u2019m Lisa Lerer, your host, bringing you a dispatch from my weekend reporting trip to Iowa. Democrats put on quite a show Friday night in Des Moines at their Liberty & Justice Celebration, a 13-candidate event considered the start of the final, three-month sprint to the Iowa caucuses. There were smoke machines! Spotlights! A runway! And, of course, thundersticks! Was this W.W.E.? No, it was the Iowa Democratic Party\u2019s annual dinner. Somehow, amid the shouts of the booming announcer and the migraine-inducing glare of thousands of glow sticks, it became clear to me that the race has entered a new phase. There has been no defining moment. No devastating gaffe. But over the past few weeks, the race in Iowa has begun to take a very different form than it had when the candidates sweated through the state fair just three months ago. For months, this was a contest between two of the biggest boldface names in Democratic politics \u2014 former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Now, the number of leading contenders has essentially doubled, creating a four-way race with Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders, yes, but also with Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. A New York Times/Siena College poll of likely caucusgoers taken last week showed those four candidates knotted at the top of the field. As I wrote with my colleague Reid Epstein over the weekend, the energy seems to be with the two fresher faces, who used the dinner as a display of organizational force. Mr. Buttigieg, helped by a cheering section of around 1,000 superfans who flew in from across the country to attend the dinner, cast himself as the heir to President Barack Obama\u2019s political legacy in his remarks \u2014 a direct shot at one of Mr. Biden\u2019s central arguments. Ms. Warren used her speech to debut a new line of attack against Mr. Biden, Mr. Buttigieg and her other centrist rivals. \u201cAnyone who comes on this stage and tells you to dream small and give up early is not going to lead our party to victory,\u201d she said. The attack underscored how questions about her \u201cMedicare for all\u201d plan have become central to this race. The Friday release of Ms. Warren\u2019s long-awaited, $20.5 trillion proposal explaining how she would fund the program prompted a new series of attacks over the weekend about the plan\u2019s specifics and whether she is being honest about the price tag. Her campaign plans to release a proposal detailing how she would manage the transition from private health insurance plans to universal government-run health coverage. But the questions are likely to trail her for the foreseeable future. Also worth noting from this weekend: The supersized field has finally begun shrinking to merely pleasantly plump. Former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas dropped out on Friday night, and rumors abound of other exits that could be coming soon. Of course, not everything has changed. As has been the case since the start of this crowded contest, most of the field has found it all but impossible to break out of the single digits in polling. At the dinner, Senators Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota delivered strong performances \u2014 to a half-empty room. (Both had the unlucky draw of speaking toward the end of the five-hour program.) And they had it far better than some of the candidates who followed. Former Representative John Delaney of Maryland was introduced with photos of Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana on the screens. And Mr. Bullock delivered the final address of the event \u2014 after being announced as Mr. Booker. Want more about Ms. Warren? Check out this story I wrote for the paper today with the ace business reporter Kate Kelly. We dive into the fury that her rise in the polls has ignited on Wall Street, where money mangers, investors and bankers are contemplating voting for President Trump, threatening to leave the country and loudly predicting a double-digit dive in the market if Ms. Warren is elected. Ms. Warren and her campaign see their rage as more beneficial than any monetary contribution. The joke making the rounds among Democrats on Wall Street is that every time a banker complains, Ms. Warren gets another thousand votes in Iowa. We want to hear from our readers. Have a question? We\u2019ll try to answer it. Have a comment? We\u2019re all ears. Email us at onpolitics@nytimes.com. As several states go to the polls, we\u2019ll have live results on NYTimes.com and in the NYTimes app on Tuesday night. Here\u2019s a cheat sheet from our colleague Trip Gabriel: Three states have particularly consequential elections on Tuesday. Kentucky and Mississippi are choosing governors in unexpectedly competitive races. But perhaps the biggest attraction is in Virginia, where control of the state legislature is up for grabs. Two years ago, the majority in the state\u2019s House of Delegates turned on a random drawing to settle a tied race. If Democrats reverse the slim majorities that Republicans hold in both chambers \u2014 as polling and a court-ordered new map of key districts suggest is likely \u2014 it will cap off a decade-long evolution of a Southern state, the former seat of the Confederacy, into a progressive bastion. With a sitting Democratic governor, Ralph Northam, new Democratic majorities in the legislature would be expected to advance liberal priorities on gun restrictions, the minimum wage, health care and civil rights protections for women and L.G.B.T. people. Perhaps most important to Democrats, unified control of state government would put the party in charge of mapping new voting districts in 2021. Virginia, which holds elections every year, has been at the forefront of a national revolt against President Trump among suburban voters since 2017. Tuesday night\u2019s returns are certain to be interpreted as a report card on Mr. Trump ahead of 2020. But Virginia is not an ideal presidential bellwether. Republicans have not won a statewide election there since 2009. These elections, like local elections everywhere now, are a kind of referendum on the president; but the simple toting up of W\u2019s and L\u2019s will not be especially meaningful. More telling will be the intensity of both parties\u2019 voters. Look for the margins of victory or loss, and the overall turnout, which nonpartisan analysts think will be in the mid-40s.

      "content": "  CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa \u2014 For months, the presidential race in Iowa was a contest between two titans of the Democratic political world, each representing distinct poles of a party struggling to define its identity in the Trump era. Now, with just three months to go before the caucuses, the ideological debate has remained the same, but the key players have shifted. For now, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is being eclipsed by Mayor Pete Buttigieg, of South Bend, Ind., a Midwestern mayor less than half his age who has captured the energy of those looking for the party to move in a more centrist direction. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has seen much of the message that had lifted him to political fame in the 2016 primary contest co-opted by Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. In polling, enthusiasm and organization, there is now a yawning gap between Ms. Warren, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Biden, Mr. Buttigieg and the other 13 Democrats running for president. A poll taken this week of likely caucusgoers by The New York Times and Siena College shows the top four candidates locked in a virtual tie atop the field, with the next contenders \u2014 starting with Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, at least 13 percentage points behind. [The latest data and analysis to keep track of who\u2019s leading the race to be the Democratic nominee.] Yet, in a field that once numbered two dozen, it is Ms. Warren and Mr. Buttigieg who have emerged as coveted fresh faces, riding a surge of momentum. Both have been rising for months \u2014 Mr. Buttigieg from the obscurity of leading a community of 100,000 people and Ms. Warren from early campaign missteps highlighted by her ill-fated decision to release a DNA test designed to combat charges that she exaggerated her Native American ancestry. With three months to go, the emergence of Ms. Warren and Mr. Buttigieg has confirmed that the race is entering a new phase, as Mr. Biden struggles to regain momentum and Mr. Sanders attempts to expand his base beyond his core supporters. \u201cThe Sanders people are mostly the same people that were Sanders people in 2016, but there seem to be fewer of them,\u201d said JoAnn Hardy, the Democratic Party chairwoman in Cerro Gordo County, Iowa. \u201cSome of them have moved on to other campaigns, not necessarily all to Warren. Warren has a wider supporter base than just former Bernie supporters.\u201d Mr. Buttigieg himself declared the contest to be a \u201ctwo-way race\u201d in an interview with the Showtime television show \u201cThe Circus,\u201d a comment that irked several others in the presidential race. \u201cAnybody who thinks that this is a two-person race right now doesn\u2019t know Iowa,\u201d former Housing Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro told reporters Saturday. For months Mr. Biden led polls in Iowa, but he has seen his support steadily shrink as other candidates have focused their time and attention on the state. [Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter.] \u201cSome of the early Biden support was name recognition, some was familiarity, some was affection and respect,\u201d said Kurt Meyer, the Democratic Party chairman of Mitchell County, Iowa. \u201cBut much of it had to be renewed and extended, much as one would renew a thick book at the local library, for it to last until early February.\u201d That has left many of the remaining 13 candidates scrambling for attention, relevance and desperately needed campaign dollars. Much of the debate among the quartet of top contenders this weekend centered around Ms. Warren\u2019s long-awaited, $20.5 trillion proposal explaining how she would fund \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d which she released on Friday. Mr. Biden on Saturday bristled at Ms. Warren\u2019s suggestion that he was borrowing Republican talking points about her health care proposal, while at the same time accusing her of peddling plans that have no chance of being enacted as law. \u201cTo say that you\u2019re a Republican or you\u2019re not loyal or you have no courage if you don\u2019t agree with such and such a position is no way to get anything passed, I promise you,\u201d Mr. Biden told reporters after speaking at a fish fry hosted by first-term Representative Abby Finkenauer. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t even get it passed. You have to be able to reach out.\u201d For Ms. Warren, the weekend marked the beginning of a crucial stretch during which she would be compelled to sell her new plan to voters. Though not all of her supporters had familiarized themselves with the details on Saturday morning, many seemed inclined to give her the benefit of the doubt. \u201cShe is passionate about what she\u2019s saying,\u201d said Renee Lapan-Islas, 50, who came to see Ms. Warren speak in Vinton, Iowa. \u201cWe struggle for money at times because of health care.\u201d But Ms. Warren also faced a skeptical question from a voter with Type 1 diabetes, who expressed concern about the continuity of care under Ms. Warren\u2019s proposed transition to \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d \u201cHealth care is a basic human right, and we fight for basic human rights,\u201d Ms. Warren said, adding that the approach was \u201cabout strengthening America\u2019s middle class\u201d and arguing that failing to dramatically overhaul the health care system would be calamitous over the long haul. At the fish fry, which drew the race\u2019s seven leading candidates to a Cedar Rapids racetrack that has become a regular stop on the Democratic presidential campaign trail, the candidates parried question about rural infrastructure, river flooding and labor rights \u2014 the sort of bread-and-butter issues Ms. Finkenauer used last year to oust a Republican incumbent. Ms. Finkenauer\u2019s mother baked 750 cupcakes, which were heartily consumed by activists, campaign staffers and the assembled press. Other candidates, too, recognized the new order. Mr. Biden declared Ms. Warren\u2019s health care proposal to be divisive. Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado and Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana denigrated the population of South Bend as relatively insignificant. The weekend began with the Liberty & Justice Celebration, a party dinner seen as the last major candidate gathering before the caucuses. While 13 candidates spoke, only about half drew any kind of notable support and, of those, Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Warren were the only ones to draw thunderous applause from their speeches. The weekend marked the latest public test of each campaign\u2019s organizational prowess. The campaigns purchase tickets for the Friday night dinner, hoping to pack the hall with their supporters. Instead of rallying supporters for his speech, Mr. Sanders led a march that his campaign said attracted 1,500 people in the Des Moines drizzle. His aides said the campaign focused on organizing volunteers for the February caucus rather than a visible demonstration of enthusiasm inside the arena. Mr. Biden hosted no such demonstration: Before the event began, allies of Mr. Biden quietly collected signs and noisemakers that had been placed out for supporters who never arrived. At the end of his remarks, Mr. Biden asked the audience to \u201cget up\u201d and defeat President Trump. Nearly everyone remained seated.",

Kent testified that he saw President Trump\u2019s demands for Ukraine to \u201cinitiate politically motivated prosecutions\u201d as corrupt.By Michael D. Shear and Nicholas FandosPRINT EDITIONNovember 8, 2019, Page A18",
      "author": "Michael D. Shear",
      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 The senior State Department official in charge of Ukraine told impeachment investigators last month that he was alarmed at President Trump\u2019s insistence that Ukraine \u201cinitiate politically motivated prosecutions,\u201d casting the effort as the kind of tactic the United States typically condemns in the world\u2019s most corrupt countries. George P. Kent, the deputy assistant secretary of state in the Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs, testified that he regarded the push for investigations \u2014 spearheaded by Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer \u2014 as \u201cinjurious to the rule of law,\u201d and to decades of American foreign policy. \u201cThere is an outstanding issue about people in office in those countries using selectively politically motivated prosecutions to go after their opponents,\u201d Mr. Kent said in his interview with the House Intelligence Committee, according to a transcript released on Thursday. \u201cAnd that\u2019s wrong for the rule of law regardless of what country that happens.\u201d Mr. Kent said he documented his concerns in a memo that he wrote over the summer, weeks before the public disclosure of a whistle-blower complaint about a July 25 call in which Mr. Trump pressured President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, to begin investigations of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and the 2016 election. In his testimony, Mr. Kent offered a new detail that appeared to underscore that political motivation was at the heart of Mr. Trump\u2019s demand for investigations by Ukraine, saying that he was told that the president wanted to hear the country\u2019s leader say the name \u201cClinton\u201d in connection with potential wrongdoing. Mr. Kent described being briefed about an early September conversation in which Mr. Trump told Gordon D. Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union, that Mr. Zelensky should publicly commit to investigating the Bidens and questions about Democratic collusion in 2016. \u201cPOTUS wanted nothing less than President Zelensky to go to microphone and say investigations, Biden and Clinton,\u201d Mr. Kent said, using an acronym for \u201cpresident of the United States.\u201d Mr. Kent said that he understood \u201cClinton\u201d to be a shorthand reference to an investigation of the 2016 campaign. That would suggest that Mr. Trump had politics in mind \u2014 not just a broader interest in Ukraine\u2019s anticorruption agenda, as his defenders have insisted \u2014 when he pressed Mr. Zelensky to take action. But Mr. Kent acknowledged during his testimony that his account of the conversation was not firsthand, and other witnesses have not mentioned it. The transcript of Mr. Kent\u2019s testimony revealed the depth of his outrage at how the United States\u2019 policy toward Ukraine has been handled under Mr. Trump. He said he believed the policy was being perverted by Mr. Giuliani and others outside of the normal channels of diplomacy. And he told the inquiry that initiating investigations for political reasons was \u201cwrong.\u201d Mr. Kent is one of the lower-profile players in the Ukraine affair, but the 355-page transcript of his account helps explain why Democrats have called him to be a witness during their first public hearing on Wednesday. A career foreign service officer who regularly sports a bow tie, Mr. Kent spoke with precision and conviction about what he described as a dangerous scheme by Mr. Trump\u2019s loyalists to bend foreign policy toward Ukraine to their political ends, undermining the rule of law and imperiling America\u2019s standing. \u201cAs a general principle, I do not believe the U.S. should ask other countries to engage in politically associated investigations and prosecutions,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that as a matter of policy the U.S. should do that, period, because I have spent much of my career trying to improve the rule of law.\u201d Democrats plan to begin public hearings next week as they seek to build their case that Mr. Trump abused his power by withholding military aid and the promise of a White House meeting unless Ukraine agreed to the investigations. Mr. Kent and William B. Taylor Jr., the top diplomat in Ukraine, will be the first witnesses called by the Democrats to testify in a set of highly anticipated hearings that are likely to be televised live. Late Thursday night, the committee issued a subpoena to compel Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, to appear for a closed-door interview on Friday. An official working on the impeachment inquiry cited Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s admission during a White House briefing \u2014 which he later tried to recant \u2014 that there was a quid pro quo to hold military aid hostage for the investigations Mr. Trump wanted. Mr. Mulvaney, one of the president\u2019s top advisers, is not expected to comply with the subpoena; the White House has asserted \u201dabsolute immunity\u201d to block top aides from testifying before Congress. The committee official said that Mr. Mulvaney should not \u201chide behind the president\u2019s continuing efforts to conceal the truth and obstruct our investigation.\u201d Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, formally invited Republicans on Thursday to request witnesses for the public hearings. Under rules governing the impeachment process adopted by the House, Republicans have until Saturday morning to make their requests, which are subject to a vote in the Democratic-controlled committee. Behind closed doors, Democrats also continued depositions, interviewing Jennifer Williams, a longtime State Department employee with expertise in Europe and Russia who is detailed to Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s national security staff. Ms. Williams told investigators that the July call stood out as unusual to her because she was not accustomed to a president discussing domestic political issues, rather than diplomatic matters, with a foreign leader, according to three people familiar with her remarks. But unlike other White House officials who listened in, she did not take any steps to report concerns to her superiors and made only a passing reference to the call in briefing materials for Mr. Pence. Ms. Williams said she did not know whether Mr. Pence read the materials, including a summary of the call, the people said. Ms. Williams also offered insight into a meeting between Mr. Pence and Mr. Zelensky in Warsaw in early September, when other government officials were pressing the Ukrainians to publicly announce the investigations Mr. Trump sought if they wanted $391 million in security aid earmarked for the country to begin flowing. In the meeting, Ms. Williams said, Mr. Zelensky asked the vice president about the delay in releasing the aid, but neither man mentioned the Ukrainian energy company Burisma, the Bidens or 2016. Mr. Pence simply told Mr. Zelensky that the Americans would make a decision on the security assistance soon, and the two leaders discussed only broadly Ukraine\u2019s anticorruption priorities. She testified that Mr. Pence spoke with Mr. Trump when Mr. Pence met with Mr. Zelensky in Warsaw in early September, but that she did not know what was discussed. Mr. Pence told reporters on Thursday that \u201cas the facts continue to come out, people will see that the president did nothing wrong, that the focus of our administration and all of my contacts with President Zelensky were in the national interests.\u201d John R. Bolton, Mr. Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, did not show up on Thursday for a voluntary interview as part of the House impeachment inquiry, but Democratic investigators said they would not subpoena him and would instead use his refusal to appear as further evidence of Mr. Trump\u2019s attempts to obstruct Congress. Mr. Bolton, who regularly interacted with Mr. Trump directly as his top national security aide in the White House, would have been among the highest-profile advisers to testify in the impeachment inquiry. Several other witnesses have described Mr. Bolton as being angry about the idea of holding up military aid to Ukraine in exchange for the country opening an investigation into the president\u2019s political rivals. But an official with the Intelligence Committee said panel members did not want to allow the Trump administration to \u201cplay rope-a-dope with us\u201d in the courts and slow down their inquiry. The transcript of Mr. Kent\u2019s testimony makes clear that he and other State Department officials responsible for the United States-Ukraine relationship were deeply alarmed by smears and accusations of disloyalty by Mr. Giuliani and his allies in Ukraine against Marie L. Yovanovitch, the former United States ambassador there. Mr. Kent testified that he watched with growing exasperation as what had begun as a fringe campaign against Ms. Yovanovitch moved into Mr. Trump\u2019s inner circle and eventually led the president to recall her to the United States this spring. \u201cMr. Giuliani, at that point, had been carrying on a campaign for several months full of lies and incorrect information about Ambassador Yovanovitch, so this was a continuation of his campaign of lies,\u201d Mr. Kent said. He called Mr. Giuliani\u2019s attacks \u201cuntrue, period\u201d and called it a \u201ccrisis that was threatening to consume the relationship\u201d between the United States and Ukraine. Despite their concerns, requests from the Kiev Embassy and Mr. Kent\u2019s bureau for strong expressions of support for Ms. Yovanovitch by the State Department were declined, he said. Asked by House investigators whether he expressed his concerns about Mr. Giuliani to others at the State Department, Mr. Kent said that he was advised not to make waves by Philip T. Reeker, his supervisor and the acting assistant secretary in charge of European and Eurasian Affairs. \u201cAfter Giuliani attacked me, as well as Ambassador Yovanovitch and the entire embassy,\u201d Mr. Kent testified, \u201cI was told to keep my head down and lower my profile in Ukraine.\u201d He said the message came as he left for a hiking trip to Maine. \u201cAnd so I said, \u2018Fine, you\u2019re not going to hear me talk about any country for the next week and a half,\u2019\u201d Mr. Kent said. \u201cAnd I did cancel some public appearances on Ukraine in June, sort of think tank sessions around Washington.\u201d",

Bolton said he had information to share with impeachment investigators. But, so far, he will not defy the White House.By Nicholas Fandos, Michael D. Shear and Peter BakerPRINT EDITIONBolton Dangles Vital Knowledge Of Ukraine Push|November 9, 2019, Page A1",
      "author": "Nicholas Fandos",
      "content": "   WASHINGTON \u2014 John R. Bolton, President Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, knows about \u201cmany relevant meetings and conversations\u201d connected to a pressure campaign on Ukraine that House impeachment investigators have not yet been informed of, his lawyer told lawmakers on Friday. The lawyer, Charles J. Cooper, tucked the tantalizing assertion into a letter to the chief House lawyer in response to committee chairmen who have sought Mr. Bolton\u2019s testimony in their impeachment inquiry but expressed unwillingness to go to court to get an order compelling it. Mr. Cooper did not elaborate on what meetings or conversations he was referring to, leaving it to House Democrats to guess at what he might know. But the hints about what Mr. Bolton might be able to add came as new details emerged from the impeachment inquiry about how an effort by Mr. Trump\u2019s allies to use the United States\u2019 relationship with Ukraine to accomplish the president\u2019s political goals opened a bitter rift inside the White House. According to testimony made public on Friday, the push, spearheaded in large part by Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, pitted Mr. Bolton, who sought repeatedly to resist it, against Mick Mulvaney, the acting chief of staff who senior officials said may have played a central role in carrying it out. Mr. Mulvaney himself failed to appear on Friday for a scheduled deposition in the inquiry, a day after Mr. Bolton. Their absences underscored dilemmas impeachment investigators face as they wrap up weeks of private fact-finding and look toward public hearings beginning next week. They are closing in on an ever more elaborate account by administration witnesses of how the pressure campaign on Ukraine unfolded, but have been unable to obtain the firsthand testimony of those closest to the president. Transcripts of testimony by Fiona Hill, the former senior director for Russia and Europe at the National Security Council, and Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman, the Ukraine expert there, described how the council under Mr. Bolton became consumed with trying to thwart Mr. Giuliani\u2019s efforts to bend Ukraine policy to the president\u2019s political advantage. They said there was evidence Mr. Mulvaney was involved in setting up a quid pro quo in which Ukraine could not receive a White House meeting unless top officials there committed to investigations that Mr. Trump wanted. And they showed how the foreign policy officials most deeply knowledgeable about Ukraine were sidelined and forced to act as mere spectators \u2014 in some instances watching for Mr. Giuliani\u2019s freewheeling appearances on cable news for clues \u2014 in dealing with the relationship with Kiev. Ms. Hill said Mr. Bolton repeatedly sought to cut off the influence of Mr. Giuliani, whom he referred to as a \u201chand grenade.\u201d Mr. Bolton was \u201cclosely monitoring what Mr. Giuliani was doing and the messaging that he was sending out,\u201d she told investigators, adding that he warned \u201crepeatedly that nobody should be meeting with Giuliani.\u201d At the same time, Ms. Hill and Colonel Vindman said, Mr. Mulvaney appeared to be pushing to use a coveted White House meeting for Ukraine\u2019s leader as leverage to secure investigations into former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son Hunter Biden, as well as possible Democratic collusion with Ukraine in 2016. Ms. Hill testified that Gordon D. Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union, told the Ukrainian officials in July during a meeting at the White House \u201cabout how he had an agreement with Chief of Staff Mulvaney for a meeting with the Ukrainians if they were going to go forward with investigations.\u201d Colonel Vindman told investigators he heard Mr. Sondland say his offer had been \u201ccoordinated\u201d with Mr. Mulvaney. Afterward, Mr. Bolton ordered Ms. Hill to tell White House lawyers he was not part of \u201cwhatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up on this.\u201d Unlike most of those who have testified so far, though, Mr. Bolton would bring knowledge of what the president himself said about the matter. Most of the witnesses have described what people around the president said, but few recounted any direct conversations with Mr. Trump. As his national security adviser who saw him daily, Mr. Bolton presumably could take investigators into the Oval Office as none of their witnesses have. House Democrats complained that Mr. Bolton was stiff-arming them, but said they would not subpoena him because they did not want to get dragged into lengthy court proceedings. Instead, Democrats have suggested that they may cite the refusal to testify as evidence of obstruction of Congress by the president, which could form its own article of impeachment. In his letter, Mr. Bolton\u2019s lawyer argued that his client would be willing to talk to investigators, but only if a court rules that he should ignore White House objections. Mr. Bolton\u2019s former deputy, Charles M. Kupperman, represented by the same lawyer, filed a lawsuit seeking guidance from the federal courts on competing demands by the executive branch, which has ordered them not to testify, and the legislative branch, which has issued subpoenas directing them to. Late Friday, Mr. Mulvaney filed to join Mr. Kupperman\u2019s lawsuit to have a court settle whether the men are obligated to comply with testimony requests. But Democrats have said they will not pursue time-consuming litigation on the matter, arguing that it is a stalling tactic. Mr. Mulvaney defied a House subpoena on Friday morning, citing instructions that he was absolutely immune from testifying. Investigators were already eager to question Mr. Mulvaney after his admission in the White House briefing room last month of a quid pro quo linking the military aid for Ukraine to that country\u2019s announcement of investigations that Mr. Trump wanted. Hours later, Mr. Mulvaney said he was misunderstood and retracted the statement. At the White House, Mr. Trump derided the coming public hearings as a \u201choax,\u201d even as he sought to project confidence that he would not be brought down by a recent stream of damning testimony from officials in his own administration who have cooperated with the impeachment inquiry. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t be having public hearings,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters as he left the White House to travel to Georgia. Reversing himself, the president also sought to put distance between himself and Mr. Sondland, a key witness at the center of the inquiry who was a campaign donor to the president and was rewarded with his plum diplomatic post. \u201cI hardly know the gentleman,\u201d Mr. Trump said. House Republicans took a significant step to ready a defense of Mr. Trump on Capitol Hill. Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the top House Republican, confirmed Friday what lawmakers had been speculating about for days: He is shuffling the makeup of a key committee to allow one of Mr. Trump\u2019s most outspoken allies to take part in public hearings. Mr. McCarthy said Friday afternoon that Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio would temporarily move onto the Intelligence Committee, swapping with another Republican lawmaker. \u201cJim Jordan has been on the front lines in the fight for fairness and truth,\u201d Mr. McCarthy said in a statement. \u201cHis addition will ensure more accountability and transparency in this sham process.\u201d The testimony laid out in the transcripts released on Friday showed for the first time the extent of the turmoil in the National Security Council \u2014 the usually staid White House body responsible for coordinating foreign policy throughout the government \u2014 first because of Mr. Giuliani\u2019s work and the conspiracies he appeared to be peddling, and later by Mr. Trump\u2019s apparent embrace of his lawyer\u2019s agenda. Ms. Hill described going home at night and watching cable television to track Mr. Giuliani\u2019s public statements about Ukraine, and said Mr. Bolton would turn up the volume if Mr. Giuliani appeared on the TV in his office. \u201cAnd then I would have to go onto YouTube or whatever else I could find, you know, kind of replays of things because people were constantly saying to me: \u2018My God, have you seen what Giuliani is saying now?\u2019\u201d she testified. After learning in mid-July that military aid to Ukraine had been abruptly frozen, Colonel Vindman told investigators that members of the National Security Council sent a series of memos to Mr. Bolton seeking to understand what they considered an \u201cabnormal\u201d process that led to the flow of aid being stopped. Days later, Colonel Vindman drafted a \u201cpresidential decision memorandum\u201d for Mr. Bolton to present to Mr. Trump. The memo discussed the importance of the aid for Ukraine and recommended that Mr. Trump release the hold, but it was never signed. Colonel Vindman said he and others were trying to \u201cnavigate this minefield\u201d on Ukraine. Both Colonel Vindman and Ms. Hill described being deeply alarmed by a July phone call between Mr. Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. During the call, which is now at the center of the impeachment inquiry, Mr. Trump told Mr. Zelensky that he would like him to do a \u201cfavor\u201d by investigating the Bidens and the allegations related to 2016. \u201cThere was no doubt,\u201d Colonel Vindman said, as he listened to the call that Mr. Trump was asking for a \u201cdeliverable\u201d from Mr. Zelensky in exchange for a White House meeting. Ms. Hill, who had already left the White House when the call was placed, said it only confirmed to her that Mr. Giuliani\u2019s efforts had successfully influenced the president. \u201cMy worst nightmare is the politicization of the relationship between the U.S. and Ukraine and, also, the usurpation of authorities, you know, for other people\u2019s personal vested interests,\u201d Ms. Hill said. \u201cAnd there seems to be a large range of people who were looking for these opportunities here.\u201d Top White House national security advisers were also dismayed that Mr. Trump specifically invoked an unproven theory that Ukraine, rather than Russia, interfered in the 2016 presidential election, possibly in coordination with Democrats. Mr. Giuliani and allies in Ukraine had tried to advance the theory in public and with Mr. Trump, but the president\u2019s advisers had spent years trying to combat it. Ms. Hill said Thomas P. Bossert, Mr. Trump\u2019s former homeland security adviser, and Mr. Bolton\u2019s predecessor, H.R. McMaster, \u201cspent a lot of time\u201d in the first year of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency refuting the claim. \u201cIt is a fiction that the Ukrainian government was launching an effort to upend our election,\u201d Ms. Hill said during one heated exchange with Republicans during her deposition. \u201cIf you\u2019re also trying to peddle an alternative variation of whether the Ukrainians subverted our election, I don\u2019t want to be part of that, and I will not be part of it.\u201d",

      "author": "Maggie Astor",
      "content": "  Less than two months ago, Michael R. Bloomberg told a PBS interviewer that he probably couldn\u2019t win a Democratic primary, and that entering the race as late as November would be \u201cpretty hard.\u201d Well, it\u2019s November now, and he seems to have changed his mind. Here\u2019s a look at what happened on the campaign trail this week. Mr. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, filed paperwork on Friday to put his name on the ballot for the Democratic primary in Alabama. According to his advisers, he has not definitively decided to run for president, but the paperwork was necessary to keep the possibility alive, because Friday was Alabama\u2019s filing deadline. Arkansas and New Hampshire have deadlines next week, and Team Bloomberg says it plans to meet those, too. If Mr. Bloomberg does enter the race, it will bring the Democratic field back to 18 candidates, the largest ever. For the past week or so, it was merely tied with the 2016 Republican field. Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s flirtation with running is part of a larger backlash to Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s continuing strength in the race \u2014 and a vote of no confidence in former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s ability to unite moderate Democrats against her. As she has cemented herself at or near the top of the polls, Ms. Warren has drawn particular vitriol from Wall Street, where some executives have already announced that they will support Mr. Bloomberg if he runs. In a Medium post this week, Mr. Biden cast Ms. Warren as an \u201celitist\u201d who takes a \u201c\u2018my way or the highway\u2019 approach to politics.\u201d And Leon Cooperman, the billionaire investor who complained recently about what he called Ms. Warren\u2019s \u201cvilification of the rich,\u201d endorsed Mr. Bloomberg. Thanks to six polls released since we last wrote, Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii has qualified for the next debate (Nov. 20), and Senators Kamala Harris of California and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota have qualified for the one after that (Dec. 19). That means 10 candidates are in for November, and six so far for December. We also learned this week that the December debate will no longer be held at the University of California, Los Angeles, because of a dispute between the university and its largest employee union. The union has called for a boycott of speaking engagements on campus. It will instead take place at Loyola Marymount University, also in Los Angeles. While President Trump\u2019s approval rating is very low, and he trails most of his potential Democratic challengers in national polls, he appears stronger in the states that will decide the election, according to a new set of polls from The New York Times and Siena College. In the six closest states that went Republican in 2016, he trails Mr. Biden among registered voters, but is deadlocked with Senator Bernie Sanders and leads Ms. Warren. Pat Murphy, the Iowa political director for Tom Steyer, resigned after reports that he had offered campaign contributions to local Iowa candidates if they endorsed Mr. Steyer. The campaign said no contributions had actually been made. \u201cOur campaign policy is clear that we will not engage in this kind of activity, or any kind of communication that could be perceived as improper,\u201d Mr. Steyer\u2019s campaign manager, Heather Hargreaves, said in a statement on Friday announcing Mr. Murphy\u2019s resignation. \u201cViolation of this policy is not tolerated.\u201d Mr. Sanders unveiled his immigration plan on Thursday, pledging to use executive action if Congress does not pass comprehensive legislation. He said that on the first day of his presidency, he would reverse President Trump\u2019s immigration policies, including the denial of asylum claims and the \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy that has led to family separations. He also vowed to halt all deportations \u201cuntil a thorough audit of current and past practices and policies is complete.\u201d More broadly, he called for ending deportations of people who have been in the United States for more than five years, creating a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, expanding the DACA program and making unauthorized immigration a civil, not criminal, offense. Ms. Warren has wholeheartedly embraced attacks from Wall Street, and on Thursday, she took it one step further: Her campaign released a \u201ccalculator for the billionaires.\u201d \u201cSome billionaires seem confused about how much they would pay under Elizabeth\u2019s Ultra-Millionaire Tax,\u201d it says. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, now we have a calculator for that too.\u201d",

He begins an aggressive phase of the primary race with far less cash on hand than top rivals.By Shane Goldmacher and Thomas KaplanPRINT EDITIONWeak Quarter for Biden Puts Him Far Behind Leaders in the Money Race|October 17, 2019, Page A17",
      "author": "Shane Goldmacher",
      "content": "  WESTERVILLE, Ohio \u2014 Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s campaign began October with less than $9 million in the bank as the 2020 Democratic primary race entered a new and more aggressive phase, barely more than a third as much cash as that of his leading rival, Senator Elizabeth Warren, and nearly $25 million behind the race\u2019s money leader, Senator Bernie Sanders. In the past three months, Mr. Biden spent more money than he raised, $17.7 million compared with $15.7 million, a sign of his operation\u2019s fiscal peril so many months before the first votes will be cast in February. On the Republican side, President Trump continued to pad his coffers for the general election, announcing that his campaign, the Republican National Committee and their shared accounts had a staggering $158 million cash on hand. The new disclosures came only moments after Mr. Biden stepped off a debate stage where the dynamics made plain that even his rivals no longer saw him as the front-runner. They are the latest sign that Mr. Biden, who relies mainly on large donors, is struggling to compete with the small-donor-funded campaigns of Ms. Warren, Mr. Sanders and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., who entered October with two and half times as much cash as Mr. Biden. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a telling moment for Biden,\u201d said Jennifer Palmieri, who served as communications director for Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign. \u201cHis supporters will see he does not have enough money, and either that will prompt a bunch of money to come in in the fourth quarter, or he\u2019s going to be in very rough shape.\u201d \u201cBecause you can\u2019t run a serious primary campaign on $9 million,\u201d she added. Democratic candidates were required to report their fund-raising for the third quarter, which went from July through September, to the Federal Election Commission by Tuesday. Mr. Sanders, of Vermont, led the Democratic field with $33.7 million cash on hand to begin October, while Ms. Warren, of Massachusetts, had $25.7 million, and Mr. Buttigieg had $23.4 million. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Mr. Biden noted that he had been in the race for less time than his rivals \u2014 he entered in April \u2014 and that he had not begun by \u201cdropping $10 million from a Senate campaign, wherever that money was raised from.\u201d He did not name Ms. Warren, though his allies have criticized her for boasting of her refusal to hold fund-raisers after beginning the race with $10 million from her Senate coffers, which had been raised while she held such events. With just under $9 million, Mr. Biden is far closer to the cash total of the political newcomer Andrew Yang, who had $6.4 million in the bank to begin October, than to those at the top of the fund-raising leader board. \u201cOh my,\u201d Patti Solis Doyle, who served as Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign manager in 2008, remarked when the figures were first posted on Twitter. Mr. Biden\u2019s treasury now ranks fifth in the Democratic field, also behind Senator Kamala Harris of California, who had $10.5 million in the bank, though her $911,000 in unpaid bills \u2014 to her pollster, media buyer and lawyers, among others \u2014 meant that her functional cash on hand was closer to $9.6 million. (Mr. Sanders, Ms. Warren and Mr. Buttigieg reported no debts.) The self-funding billionaire Tom Steyer, who entered the race in July and reported spending $47 million, also has more financial resources than Mr. Biden heading toward the Iowa caucuses, which are less than four months away. Mr. Biden\u2019s team has steadfastly said that it has enough cash to run the campaign it wants, and recently announced plans to spend $6 million on digital and television ads in the coming months. \u201cThe fundamental question about fund-raising is: Do you have what you need to run your race? And we do,\u201d said Kate Bedingfield, a deputy campaign manager for Mr. Biden. On Friday, Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign manager, Greg Schultz, scheduled a conference call with the campaign\u2019s donors, presumably to reassure them about the path forward. Top fund-raisers for Mr. Biden recently gathered in Philadelphia for a full day of briefings on Mr. Biden\u2019s strategy through Super Tuesday in early March. But with Mr. Biden relatively low on funds and now trailing Ms. Warren in some polls in both of the first two voting states, Iowa and New Hampshire, his campaign faces the possibility of a serious pinch on his resources, long before the campaign expands to bigger states like California and Texas. Tad Devine, a veteran Democratic strategist who advised Mr. Sanders\u2019s 2016 campaign but is not working for anyone in the 2020 race, said the lack of cash would limit Mr. Biden\u2019s political options. He pointed to the variety of areas where campaigns might want to invest money: airing television ads, deploying staff on the ground, staging splashy but expensive events and running a robust digital program. \u201cYour strategic options are limited,\u201d Mr. Devine said, adding that the options available to Mr. Biden\u2019s better-funded rivals were \u201cmuch bigger.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s going to have to place the right bet,\u201d Mr. Devine said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to have to be a winner. It\u2019s almost like you\u2019re playing roulette, and one guy gets five numbers and the other guy gets one number. Who\u2019s going to win?\u201d Over the summer, Mr. Biden had already begun to slash his digital spending budget, which was also clear in the new fillings. He spent about $1 million in the first half of the quarter and about $311,000 in the second half, records show. During the quarter, Mr. Biden also spent $924,000 on a charter jet company, Advanced Aviation Team, as he raced across the country not only for rallies and speeches but also for dozens of fund-raisers on both coasts. Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign said the costs included paying for carbon offsets. Mr. Biden\u2019s biggest expense is his payroll, which cost about $6.8 million in the past three months, records show. Mr. Biden had roughly 440 people on his payroll \u2014 about as many as Mr. Buttigieg \u2014 while Ms. Warren had more than 600 and Mr. Sanders had about 550. In addition to his staff, Mr. Biden also paid more than $250,000 to various fund-raising consultants and nearly $500,000 in rent to cover both his downtown Philadelphia headquarters and outposts in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. While Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders have rejected traditional fund-raising from large donors, Mr. Biden spent much of September traveling the country to collect $1,000 and $2,800 checks. More than two-thirds of his fund-raising, about $10.8 million, came from donors giving more than $200; less than $5 million came from those who gave less than that. Mr. Biden was hardly the only candidate to spend more than he raised last quarter. Over half of the candidates, including Ms. Harris, did so, with Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota reporting the highest so-called burn rate, spending $1.62 for every dollar raised. Several campaigns reported less than $1 million in the bank, though only one candidate who appeared at Tuesday\u2019s debate was in such a dire financial position: Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former housing secretary, had less than $700,000 left.",

      "author": "Katie Glueck",
      "content": "  WESTERVILLE, Ohio \u2014 In the last few days, Joseph R. Biden Jr. has unveiled a new government ethics plan and vowed that his family members would do no business overseas during a Biden presidency. His son, Hunter Biden, said he would step down from his role with a Chinese investment firm, and sat for his first television interview of the campaign. And in Iowa, the elder Mr. Biden delivered a fist-pounding diatribe against President Trump, casting him as the embodiment of public corruption. Altogether, it has added up to the most assertive attempt by Mr. Biden and his camp to extinguish questions about his son\u2019s business activities since Mr. Trump began raising them as a campaign issue, often in false or exaggerated terms. What remains to be seen is whether Mr. Biden can put those issues to rest on a far bigger stage \u2014 at the CNN/New York Times Democratic primary debate in central Ohio on Tuesday night. As fierce as Mr. Biden\u2019s efforts have been since the start of the weekend, he has in some ways raised as many questions as he has answered. If his family intends to shun foreign business in the event that he becomes president \u2014 as Hunter Biden said he would on Sunday \u2014 voters may wonder why they didn\u2019t do it far sooner, when Mr. Biden was conducting foreign diplomacy as vice president. Perhaps most of all, anxious Democratic leaders are looking to the former vice president for a sign on the debate stage that all of this is not coming too late in this campaign to make a difference \u2014 to quash the undercurrent of doubt among some Democratic strategists, activists, donors and voters that Mr. Biden is really ready for a general-election fight against a president prepared to scorch and smear his way to a second term. \u201cI\u2019m a little worried about how Joe\u2019s going to do if he were to get on a debate stage with the president, a little worried he\u2019d be able to get him rattled,\u201d said Tom Courtney, the co-chairman of the Des Moines County Democrats in Iowa, a state where the Biden campaign has made substantial investments. \u201cI would like to see him quit getting bogged down in little things. This guy has got way more experience than all the other candidates up there. He needs to take charge and show that.\u201d Mr. Biden is hardly the only candidate who faces high stakes in Tuesday\u2019s debate. Senator Bernie Sanders, 78, the oldest candidate in the race, suffered a heart attack. He now faces significant questions about his age and stamina at a moment when he consistently trails Mr. Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren in many national polls. Ms. Warren, a new front-runner, is all but certain to confront more scrutiny from other candidates onstage, which would put to the test her ability to weather sharper criticism in the national spotlight. But no one among the 12 candidates in the debate has faced as many challenges as Mr. Biden \u2014 some of them self-inflicted, and some created by a president in full attack mode, seizing on Hunter Biden\u2019s overseas business dealings in an attempt to tarnish the former vice president. After responding tentatively at first, Mr. Biden has steadily increased his counterattacks against Mr. Trump. At a news conference in Altoona, Iowa, on Sunday, Mr. Biden ferociously defended his family, tore into \u201clying President\u201d Trump and issued several oblique swipes at members of the Trump family, who have their own records of overseas business dealings. Mr. Biden himself has pledged to be more assertive in Tuesday\u2019s debate, acknowledging at a fund-raiser last week that \u201cI\u2019ve got to be more aggressive\u201d and adding, \u201cI\u2019m not complaining, I\u2019m a big boy.\u201d \u201cWhen he says, \u2018I\u2019m going to be more forceful and active on the stage,\u2019 I think he means he\u2019s not going to let people misrepresent his record, and in particular, he\u2019s going to take it to Trump because I think he\u2019s had enough,\u201d said Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware and a Biden ally. Mr. Biden enters the debate having endured perhaps the worst month of his candidacy, a period defined by his slow and halting pushback against Mr. Trump \u2014 a hesitancy some early-state Democratic voters have noticed \u2014 and a time-consuming scramble for campaign donations at the end of a less than commanding fund-raising quarter. Mr. Biden is more reliant on high-dollar fund-raisers than his leading rivals, a requirement that took him largely out of public view for days, just as Mr. Trump was amplifying his false claims about Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings overseas. Steve Snyder, a college professor from Des Moines, expressed respect for Mr. Biden as he waited for Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., to address a shivering crowd gathered outside a Des Moines high school on Saturday night. But, noting the pace of the president\u2019s broadsides against Mr. Biden, he said that the Biden campaign appeared to be \u201cslow-footing\u201d their response, even as he acknowledged the challenges of responding to Mr. Trump. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a typical campaign,\u201d said Mr. Snyder, who said he is leaning toward supporting Ms. Warren. \u201cThis is information warfare. They\u2019re just not responding quick enough.\u201d Asked to address concerns that Mr. Biden\u2019s message was getting drowned out, a view which was shared by some other Iowa voters, Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign spokesman, T.J. Ducklo, said in a statement Sunday that Mr. Biden \u201cwill continue punching back hard against Donald Trump\u2019s pathetic and increasingly unhinged behavior, while also keeping the focus on issues where Trump has failed middle class families, like rising health care costs and the urgent climate crisis.\u201d He also cited Mr. Biden\u2019s standing in recent polls, arguing that \u201cthese attacks aren\u2019t working with Democratic voters.\u201d Mr. Biden\u2019s numbers have generally remained steady at the national level since the controversy over Ukraine broke open last month. Yet Mr. Biden, who months ago held a commanding edge over his rivals, has nearly lost his lead in primary polls, having dipped well below 30 percent in The New York Times national polling average. He is barely ahead of Ms. Warren in that ranking, which gauges national support, and he is tied with her, or trailing, in three of the four early-voting states. While Mr. Biden maintains a powerful bloc of support in the race, built on the loyalty of African-American voters and moderate whites, that coalition has been shrinking rather than growing \u2014 a trend he must reverse if he is to become the nominee. Mr. Biden raised $15.2 million in the third quarter, a sturdy sum but far less than what Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren collected. He also trails Mr. Buttigieg, who has become a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre for many party donors. And Mr. Biden has declined to reveal how much money he had in the bank at the end of September, raising concerns among his supporters that he may not have the cash reserves required to defend his dwindling lead. He is legally required to disclose that figure by the end of Tuesday, a coincidence that makes the evening of the debate a moment of truth for his campaign in more ways than one. The debate, his allies acknowledge, is perhaps his best chance to reassure his supporters and regain some momentum in the race. That would likely require a feat Mr. Biden has not accomplished so far in this race: a thoroughly forceful debate performance, free of missteps or flustered responses to predictable criticism from his Democratic opponents. \u201cHe needs to figure out how he wants to handle all this Trump noise,\u201d said Jeff Link, a veteran Iowa Democratic strategist. \u201cHe\u2019s got to find a way to basically say to the audience, \u2018There\u2019s only one guy that Trump is worried about and is attacking, and let me tell you what I\u2019m going to do about it.\u2019\u201d",

      "author": "Jonathan Martin",
      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 Democrats in the country\u2019s most pivotal general election battlegrounds prefer a moderate presidential nominee who would seek common ground with Republicans rather than pursue an ambitious, progressive agenda, according to a New York Times/Siena College poll of primary voters across six states. As the Democratic candidates intensify their argument over how best to defeat President Trump, their core voters in Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Arizona and Florida are counseling them to pursue a political middle ground. A majority of those surveyed said they wanted a Democratic nominee who is more moderate than most Democrats, and they overwhelmingly preferred one who would bridge the partisan divide in Washington. The party\u2019s voters are more evenly split on the scale of change they are seeking from their nominee: 49 percent said they preferred a candidate who would return politics in Washington to normal, while 45 percent hope for one who will bring fundamental change to American society. The poll showed a top tier of three candidates in the battleground states: Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. Mr. Biden was leading in five of the six states, while Ms. Warren enjoyed a narrow advantage within the margin of error in Wisconsin, where Mr. Sanders also appeared strong. No other candidate registered in double digits in any of the states surveyed. While Democrats have unambiguously moved to the left in the decade since President Barack Obama took office, as Republicans eagerly point out, the poll illustrates that the party\u2019s identity is more complex than the opposition and some progressive activists would portray it. Democratic voters in the six states, each of which Mr. Trump carried three years ago, are split almost equally in how they described themselves ideologically: 49 percent say they are moderate or conservative, while 48 percent indicate they are very liberal or somewhat liberal. And this presidential primary reflects the party\u2019s contrasting impulses. Primary voters who long for a moderate standard-bearer and a return to normalcy in Washington strongly prefer Mr. Biden, according to the survey. Those Democrats who prefer a progressive nominee and want them to fight for a bold agenda while bringing systemic change to American society are nearly evenly divided between Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren. The divisions go beyond ideology and ambition: Older, nonwhite Democrats and those without college degrees strongly favor Mr. Biden. But younger Democrats of all races prefer Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders, while those with college degrees overwhelmingly prefer Ms. Warren. None of the six states where voters were polled are casting ballots in the first stage of the primary next year, and only North Carolina votes on Super Tuesday, in early March, immediately after the initial early-voting states. So the candidate preferences could change by the time these states hold their nominating contests. The Times/Siena survey of 1,568 Democratic primary voters in the six states was conducted from Oct. 13 to 26. It has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2.8 percentage points. Sampling error in individual states is higher. In preferences for individual candidates, the major distinction between the six states and Iowa, where The Times and Siena polled caucusgoers late last month, is that Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., is in the top tier with Ms. Warren, Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders in Iowa. But he has scant support in the battleground states and despite winning a wave of attention in recent months, he was one of several candidates to poll at zero percent among black voters in those states. The ideological and generational divisions shaping this primary are strikingly similar in the Iowa and battleground surveys. Mr. Biden has nearly three times the support from voters over 65 that he does among those 29 and younger. And he does three times better among self-described moderates and conservatives than he does among those who say they are very liberal. The former vice president\u2019s support from older voters is especially pronounced among nonwhite Democrats. Nearly half of the racial minorities surveyed who were 45 and older backed Mr. Biden, while Mr. Sanders received 10 percent and Ms. Warren 9 percent. What\u2019s more ominous for Mr. Biden is that his support with younger nonwhite voters is far more tenuous: Among racial minorities under 45, Mr. Sanders was the favorite at 28 percent, followed by Ms. Warren at 19 percent and Mr. Biden at only 11 percent. Xiomara Alarcon, a 24-year-old postal worker from Greensboro, N.C., described Mr. Sanders as \u201cpure-hearted,\u201d a true-believing advocate for progressive policies like \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d She also approvingly noted that he was arrested as a young activist in 1963. \u201cHe fights for all people of color,\u201d said Ms. Alarcon, who identifies as Hispanic. \u201cNot just himself and his people.\u201d Among African-American voters of all ages in the six states, Mr. Biden was the overwhelming favorite, receiving 42 percent of that vote. Ms. Warren captured 13 percent, and Mr. Sanders had 10 percent. That finding aligns with other polling through the year that reinforces Mr. Biden\u2019s high standing with black voters, forged through ties with congressional and community leaders, and most significantly, through his relationship with former President Obama. \u201cHe was Obama\u2019s vice president and some of the things Obama supported, he supported,\u201d Michael Elliott, 61, of Jacksonville, Fla., said of Mr. Biden. \u201cVice president, that\u2019s as close as you can get to being a president. I\u2019m looking at experience, too.\u201d Nearly 300 miles down the Florida coast, William Stewart, 39, raised concerns about Mr. Biden\u2019s ability to appeal to younger voters and said he was currently supporting Ms. Warren. \u201cIt would be great for a woman to be president,\u201d said Mr. Stewart, of West Palm Beach. Mr. Stewart, a logistics manager, identifies as African-American. \u201cI believe in some of the thoughts she has about health care and equal rights for everybody.\u201d As for Mr. Biden, he said, \u201cI have a little reservation about if he\u2019s connecting with the younger people.\u201d Ms. Warren was strongest among voters who identified as \u201cvery liberal,\u201d winning 35 percent, while Mr. Biden captured just 13 percent of those voters. She also dominated with white college graduates, capturing 33 percent, far more than Mr. Biden or Mr. Sanders. Mr. Biden was strongest among white voters without a four-year degree, taking 30 percent \u2014 double Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders, who both captured 15 percent of these voters. \u201cJoe Biden has the experience,\u201d said Diane Ethridge, 60, of Green Bay, Wis. \u201cI also think he\u2019s more willing to listen and he will do far better with trade with this country, he will do far better, I think also even in the Democratic Party, with health care.\u201d Ms. Ethridge, who attended vocational school and worked at a phone company, said she opposed Medicare for all and efforts to make college free, proposals supported in various forms by Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders. \u201cShe\u2019s doing well in the polls,\u201d she said of Ms. Warren, \u201cbut I am not for her political platform of Medicare for all. I don\u2019t know where this money is going to be coming from. I am not in favor of education for all, either. I don\u2019t feel we should be paying for someone who could afford to pay for it.\u201d\n\nEven some of Ms. Warren\u2019s supporters expressed concerns about the practical and political considerations of her Medicare for all plan. Ms. Warren has said her proposal will not raise taxes on the middle class. Last Friday she unveiled a plan describing how she would pay for an initiative that she says would cost $20.5 trillion in new federal spending over a decade. \u201cI\u2019m very skeptical\u201d about the tax implications, Mr. Stewart, of Florida, said. \u201cThat\u2019s the only discrepancy. I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s possible.\u201d",

In five months, his obsession upended American foreign policy and threatened his presidency. Here is how it happened.By Sharon LaFraniere, Andrew E. Kramer and Danny HakimPRINT EDITIONHow an Obsession With Ukraine Created a Crisis|November 12, 2019, Page A1",
      "author": "Sharon LaFraniere",
      "content": "   WASHINGTON \u2014 Like every presidential conversation with a foreign leader, this one had scripted talking points and a predigested news release recounting an exchange yet to take place. Aides in the White House Situation Room clustered around a speaker phone, pens and pads in hand to document what they heard. At 9:03 a.m. on Thursday, July 25, they listened as President Trump picked up the phone in the White House residence and was connected to Volodymyr Zelensky, the newly elected president of Ukraine. Within minutes, two note-takers exchanged troubled looks. Mr. Trump had not merely veered off his talking points. By the conversation\u2019s end, he had asked Mr. Zelensky \u2014 a leader in dire need of American military aid to fight the Russian-led invasion on his eastern border \u2014 to \u201cdo us a favor\u201d by investigating one of his political rivals and an unfounded conspiracy theory about the 2016 election. That 30-minute conversation has now emerged as a mortal threat to Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency. This week, the House of Representatives begins public hearings that could lead to the impeachment of a president for only the third time in American history. More than a half dozen Trump administration officials have called the phone conversation and the events surrounding it insidious and shocking. Five officials who dealt with Ukraine have resigned since September. The unfolding story is in many ways a sequel to the events that led to Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Once again, the plot involves foreign influence in an election and is centered in the post-Soviet sphere. Only one day before Mr. Trump spoke to Mr. Zelensky, Mr. Mueller had testified to Congress about how the Russians had tried to help elect Mr. Trump by organizing the theft and release of emails damaging to his opponent. In that case, the Russians were the pursuers who sought contacts with Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign. Now the president and his minions were the aggressors, seeking help with the 2020 re-election effort. They asked the Ukrainians to investigate unfounded allegations about former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., one of Mr. Trump\u2019s leading Democratic rivals, as well as to chase a conspiracy theory that Ukraine, not Russia, had intervened in 2016. The story is also another chapter in Mr. Trump\u2019s war on the wheels of American governance, from the intelligence community to the diplomatic corps to Congress itself. In his zeal to win Mr. Zelensky\u2019s compliance, the president ousted the American ambassador to Ukraine, froze congressionally approved military aid, shut out foreign-policy experts in the National Security Council and sidestepped the State Department to set up a back-channel to Kiev with his personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani. The Ukraine saga is yet another episode in which Russia is the potential beneficiary of White House decisions. Mr. Trump not only sought to muddy the picture of Russia\u2019s role in the 2016 election, but also withheld nearly $400 million in military aid, a tenth of Ukraine\u2019s defense budget, for its war with Russian-backed forces. The Russians \u201cwould love the humiliation of Zelensky at the hands of the Americans,\u201d William B. Taylor Jr., the top diplomat in Kiev who nearly quit in protest, testified to Congress. This account of the effort to muscle the Ukrainians for Mr. Trump\u2019s political gain is based on interviews with more than a dozen American and Ukrainian principals as well as thousands of pages of witnesses\u2019 testimony in the House impeachment inquiry. More details and revelations are likely to surface in the hearings that begin Wednesday in the historic House Ways and Means Committee room on Capitol Hill. But what is already striking is the intense pressure the Trump White House exerted on one of the weakest nations in Europe. Mr. Zelensky dodged the White House\u2019s demands for months, but with one or more Ukrainians a week dying under Russian fire in the east, he finally ran out of options. In a CNN interview scheduled for Sept. 13, Mr. Zelensky aimed to satisfy Mr. Trump with an announcement about investigations. Only at the last minute, after key members of Congress erupted in protest over Mr. Trump\u2019s actions, did the White House release the aid. Mr. Zelensky canceled his appearance, and \u2014 for the moment, at least \u2014 Ukraine\u2019s perils abated. Mr. Trump\u2019s, however, were only beginning. Mr. Zelensky\u2019s election in April garnered limited attention in the United States. But it thrilled American foreign policy experts who had watched Ukraine struggle for decades in the shadow of Russian economic and military threats, seesawing between democracy and authoritarianism. Mr. Zelensky, a former comedian with no political experience, had campaigned against corruption and won a landslide victory. He quickly opened a special court to hear corruption cases and stripped legislators of immunity from criminal prosecution, two long-awaited reforms. \u201cThere was much excitement in Kiev that this time things could be different \u2014 a new Ukraine might finally be breaking from its corrupt, post-Soviet past,\u201d Mr. Taylor testified. Mr. Zelensky hoped to cement a relationship with the American president. But even before he took office, his aides suspected that the route to Mr. Trump ran through Mr. Giuliani rather than the State Department or the National Security Council. The former New York mayor\u2019s influence over administration policy toward Ukraine \u201cwas almost unmissable,\u201d George P. Kent, a deputy assistant secretary of state, testified. Mr. Giuliani and his allies had worked for months to force out Marie L. Yovanovitch, the American ambassador in Kiev, claiming, with no evidence, that she was disloyal to Mr. Trump. Gordon D. Sondland, a Republican donor with no diplomatic experience whom Mr. Trump had appointed ambassador to the European Union, offered Ms. Yovanovitch some unwanted advice: She might save her job, he counseled, if she extolled Mr. Trump in Twitter messages. \u201cYou know the president,\u201d he told her, according to Ms. Yovanovitch\u2019s testimony to Congress. Ms. Yovanovitch\u2019s superiors insisted that she was an exemplary public servant who had been falsely accused. She nonetheless was abruptly recalled to Washington in May, a decision Mr. Kent, the deputy assistant secretary of state, called dispiriting. Ms. Yovanovitch testified that she did not know exactly why, but she believed that Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Trump saw her as an obstacle to their strategy for Ukraine. Even before she was ousted, Mr. Giuliani and the president were leveling charges on Fox News against one of Mr. Trump\u2019s main Democratic rivals, Joseph R. Biden Jr. As vice president, they claimed, Mr. Biden had forced Mr. Zelensky\u2019s predecessor to fire a state prosecutor to quash an investigation of a Ukrainian gas company, Burisma, that had hired Mr. Biden\u2019s son Hunter. No evidence has emerged to support that charge or that points to any crime by Hunter Biden. As vice president, Mr. Biden was among many Western officials who considered the prosecutor corrupt and urged that he be fired. Mr. Trump had also embraced a fringe theory, debunked by extensive evidence, that a central event in the 2016 campaign \u2014 the theft of private emails from Democratic computers and their release on the rogue website WikiLeaks \u2014 had not been carried out by Russia, as both American intelligence experts and a criminal inquiry had proven, but by Ukraine. Mr. Giuliani saw the Ukraine intrigues as a perfect riposte to the criminal investigation by the special counsel, Mr. Mueller, that had cast such a shadow over Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency. So did Mr. Trump, who told reporters that Ukrainians were behind the \u201choax that was perpetrated on our country\u201d \u2014 one of his favorite terms for the Mueller inquiry. If Mr. Trump could promote the Ukraine theory, he might be able to undercut the evidence that the Russians had tried to get him elected, and put to rest questions about his legitimacy. Soon after Mr. Zelensky\u2019s election, Mr. Giuliani\u2019s allies relayed a message that the president\u2019s lawyer wanted to meet with him. It was the beginning of a five-month high-wire act in which Mr. Zelensky tried to mollify Mr. Trump and his messengers, yet hang on to the support of members of Congress and diplomats who told him not to get mired in American politics. Initially, the Ukrainian leader put Mr. Giuliani off, a move that went over badly. In a subsequent appearance on Fox News, Mr. Giuliani suggested that Mr. Zelensky had surrounded himself with \u201cenemies of the president and in some cases enemies of the United States.\u201d In what some saw as a sign of Mr. Trump\u2019s personal displeasure, a White House aide later said, Mr. Trump\u2019s team also downgraded the American delegation to Mr. Zelensky\u2019s May 20 inauguration, replacing Vice President Mike Pence as the group\u2019s senior official with Energy Secretary Rick Perry. Three days later, fresh from Mr. Zelensky\u2019s swearing-in, Mr. Sondland, the European Union ambassador, and Kurt D. Volker, an American special envoy to Ukraine, went to an Oval Office meeting. There they praised Mr. Zelensky as a reformer who deserved American support. The president would have none of it. \u201cThey are all corrupt, they are all terrible people,\u201d Mr. Trump retorted, according to Mr. Volker. He added, \u201cThey tried to take me down.\u201d Mr. Trump was apparently referring to Ukraine\u2019s disclosure in 2016 of tens of millions of dollars in secret payments to Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign chairman at the time, who had worked as a consultant to one of Mr. Zelensky\u2019s predecessors. Mr. Manafort was forced to resign from the Trump campaign and is now in prison for crimes related to those payments. In the Oval Office, the president told both men to coordinate future Ukraine-related initiatives with Mr. Giuliani. \u201cHe just kept saying: \u2018Talk to Rudy, talk to Rudy,\u2019\u201d Mr. Sondland testified. And they did, creating a foreign policy back channel that bewildered both Ukrainians and high-ranking administration officials. Among those officials was John R. Bolton, Mr. Trump\u2019s third national security adviser. Just days earlier, he had warned Fiona Hill, one of his top deputies: \u201cGiuliani is a hand grenade who\u2019s going to blow everybody up.\u201d Mr. Sondland, a blustery hotelier who had parlayed a $1 million donation to Mr. Trump\u2019s inaugural into his ambassadorship, assumed the role as principal go-between with the Ukrainians. He did not like taking instructions from Mr. Giuliani, he testified, but Mr. Giuliani made it clear he spoke for the president. What Mr. Trump wanted, Mr. Giuliani told him, was a public declaration that Ukraine was investigating two matters: Burisma, the firm that had hired Hunter Biden, and whether Ukraine had meddled in the 2016 election. Mr. Bolton and State Department officials were largely cut out of discussions about how to achieve that. But that changed on July 10. More than a half dozen American and Ukrainian officials gathered that day in Mr. Bolton\u2019s West Wing office, including Mr. Sondland, Mr. Volker, Mr. Bolton, Ms. Hill and Alexander S. Vindman, Mr. Bolton\u2019s chief Ukraine specialist. The Ukrainians included Andriy Yermak, a top aide to Mr. Zelensky, and Alexander Danyliuk, Mr. Bolton\u2019s counterpart in Kiev. All went well until the Ukrainians raised one of Mr. Zelensky\u2019s most important issues: An invitation to the White House that Mr. Trump had promised in a letter after Mr. Zelensky was elected. Mr. Sondland blurted out that Mick Mulvaney, the president\u2019s acting chief of staff, had guaranteed the invitation as long as Ukraine announced the investigations. By then, Ms. Hill testified, she and others recognized \u201cinvestigations\u201d as code for Burisma, the Bidens and the 2016 election. Mr. Bolton stiffened, witnesses said, and abruptly ended the meeting. He pulled Ms. Hill aside and told her to report what had transpired to John A. Eisenberg, the chief legal adviser to the National Security Council. \u201cTell Eisenberg that I am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up,\u201d he said, according to Ms. Hill\u2019s testimony. He dispatched her to catch up to the others in the White House basement, where Mr. Sondland had reconvened discussions with the Ukrainians. Ms. Hill listened long enough to hear the word \u201cBurisma,\u201d then declared the meeting over. But if Mr. Bolton had hoped to blow up the back channel for Ukraine policy that day, he failed. At 9:15 that morning, over coffee at the nearby Trump International Hotel, Mr. Yermak had asked Mr. Volker to connect him to Mr. Giuliani. \u201cI feel the key for many things is Rudy,\u201d Mr. Yermak texted the envoy. He later met the president\u2019s lawyer in Madrid. By mid-July, it became evident that there was more than an Oval Office meeting at stake for Ukraine. The military assistance was in play, too. Eight days after the debacle with the Ukrainians at the White House came another bombshell. A secure video conference call with national security officials was interrupted by the disembodied voice of an Office of Management and Budget staffer. At Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s direction, the staffer said, the office had placed a hold on $391 million in military aid for Ukraine. Mr. Taylor, the top American envoy to Ukraine, said he listened \u201cin astonishment.\u201d For four years, Russia had fought to expand its grip on Ukrainian territory. About 13,000 Ukrainian soldiers had died. Every morning, Ukrainian soldiers stood in formation in front of the Defense Ministry to commemorate their dead. Mr. Taylor traveled later that month to the front lines, where Ukrainian soldiers faced hostile Russian forces across a damaged bridge. He listened uncomfortably as a Ukrainian military commander, unaware that the White House had held up military aid, thanked him for America\u2019s support. It was against this backdrop that Mr. Trump\u2019s July 25 conversation with Mr. Zelensky unfolded. The president told Mr. Zelensky that the United States had done much for his nation and raised the \u201cfavor\u201d he wanted: the inquiries into the 2016 election and the Bidens. What the Bidens had done \u201csounds horrible to me,\u201d he said, according to a White House reconstructed transcript of the call. Mr. Trump added that Mr. Giuliani would be in touch. Mr. Zelensky assured Mr. Trump that a new prosecutor would investigate Burisma and noted that his aide, Mr. Yermak, had already talked to Mr. Giuliani. Apparently pleased, Mr. Trump later told reporters that the new Ukrainian leader was \u201ca very reasonable guy.\u201d But Colonel Vindman, the national security expert on Ukraine who was taking notes on the conversation in the Situation Room, was staggered by the implications of Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks. He headed for the office of Mr. Eisenberg, the National Security Council\u2019s chief legal adviser, to question the propriety of the demand for investigations. Mr. Eisenberg quickly shunted the official summary of the conversation to an electronic storage system normally used for the most sensitive classified information. Later, he instructed Colonel Vindman not to discuss the phone call with others. Nonetheless, a Central Intelligence Agency officer detailed to the White House got wind of it. On Aug. 12, he filed a whistle-blower complaint, which slowly made its way to Congress. After the July 25 phone call, Mr. Sondland, Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Volker worked to draft an announcement for Mr. Zelensky that would satisfy Mr. Trump\u2019s demands. Mr. Giuliani rejected one draft because it failed to mention the targets of the investigations. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t say Burisma and it doesn\u2019t say 2016 what does it mean?\u201d he asked Mr. Volker in a text. But the Ukrainians were hesitating. Mr. Yermak, Mr. Zelensky\u2019s aide, said the White House should set a date for Mr. Zelensky\u2019s meeting with Mr. Trump before the Ukrainians released a statement. Only after an American official explicitly told the Ukrainians that the military aid depended on that announcement did their resistance finally crumble. Colonel Vindman, the national security aide, had drafted a memo for Mr. Bolton to give Mr. Trump in a meeting on Aug. 16. It said that the National Security Council, the Defense Department and the State Department all agreed that the aid should be released to Ukraine. But Mr. Trump rejected it, Colonel Vindman testified. Timothy Morrison, a National Security Council regional expert, told Mr. Taylor: \u201cThe president doesn\u2019t want to provide any assistance at all.\u201d Mr. Taylor protested in phone calls, text messages and in person. He complained to Mr. Bolton when the national security adviser came to Kiev to meet Mr. Zelensky in late August. On Mr. Bolton\u2019s advice, he sent a rare first-person cable to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Aug. 29 describing the hold on the funds as \u201cfolly.\u201d On Sept. 1, an anxious Mr. Zelensky asked Vice President Mike Pence about the money during an event in Warsaw to commemorate the outbreak of World War II. Mr. Pence said only that he would raise it with Mr. Trump. But Mr. Sondland, who also was at the event, took Mr. Yermak aside to deliver an explicit message: The Ukrainians should not expect the money if Mr. Zelensky did not publicly announce the investigations. \u201cIt kept getting more insidious,\u201d Mr. Sondland testified. Mr. Taylor, who took notes of his conversations, said the ambassador told him that \u201ceverything was on the line,\u201d unless Mr. Zelensky put himself \u201cin a public box.\u201d In Kiev, all but one of Mr. Zelenksy\u2019s senior advisers argued that he had no choice but to give in. If left frozen, the military aid would expire at the end of the American government\u2019s fiscal year on Sept 30. Mr. Zelensky scheduled a Sept. 13 interview on CNN to deliver an announcement designed to satisfy Mr. Trump. But the ground was suddenly shifting in Washington. The hold on the aid, first reported by Politico on Aug. 28, had surprised and angered members of Congress. Word of the whistle-blower complaint had also reached the top echelons of the National Security Council. As soon as Congress learned of it in early September, three House committees opened investigations. In the meantime, Mr. Taylor was still pushing Mr. Sondland to lobby Mr. Trump to change his mind. \u201cI think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\u201d he texted the ambassador. Mr. Sondland called Mr. Trump on Sept. 7 to see if there was any wiggle room. \u201cWhat do you want from Ukraine?\u201d Mr. Sondland testified that he asked Mr. Trump. \u201c\u2018I want nothing,\u2019\u201d he quoted Mr. Trump as replying. \u201c\u2018I want no quid pro quo. I want Zelensky to do the right thing.\u2019\u201d \u201cI recall that the president was really in a bad mood,\u201d Mr. Sondland testified. The White House reversed course and released the $391 million just two days before Mr. Zelensky\u2019s CNN interview. Two weeks later, it also released a rough transcript of the July 25 call, hoping to defuse the formal impeachment inquiry now underway. Instead, it accelerated it. Mr. Volker called the transcript \u201cexplosive\u201d and resigned just before he testified. Mr. Kent, the deputy assistant secretary of state, told investigators that Mr. Trump had stood United States policy on its head. For decades, he said, the United States had demanded that leaders in Ukraine and other countries stop instigating politically motivated prosecutions of their opponents and uphold the rule of law. For Mr. Trump to ask Ukraine to investigate his political rival for his political gain, he said, was \u201cwrong.\u201d Ms. Hill testified that she was \u201cshocked\u201d and \u201cvery saddened\u201d by the transcript of the calls and documents. Together, she said, they confirmed \u201cmy worst fears and nightmares\u201d that private interests had subverted America\u2019s national security concerns. Her former boss, Mr. Bolton, who resigned in September, has said he would not testify unless a federal court rules that he can legally do so. But in a letter to the court last week, his lawyer suggested more is to come. Mr. Bolton, he said, knows of many other White House meetings and discussions about Ukraine that have yet to become public. ",

      "author": "Sydney Ember",
      "content": " CORALVILLE, Iowa \u2014 Bernie Sanders on Saturday unleashed his most forceful rebuke yet of Michael R. Bloomberg\u2019s potential presidential bid, warning the former mayor of New York that he would not be able to \u201cbuy this election\u201d and chastising his plan to skip campaigning in the early states. Speaking at a rally in Coralville, near the liberal home of the University of Iowa, Mr. Sanders, the senator from Vermont, repeatedly addressed Mr. Bloomberg by name, almost daring him to enter a Democratic primary race that has already been in progress for months. \u201cOur campaign is going to end the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality which exists in America today,\u201d said Mr. Sanders, who was joined by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a standard-bearer of the progressive left. \u201cSo tonight we say to Michael Bloomberg and other billionaires: Sorry, you ain\u2019t going to buy this election.\u201d He also derided Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s intended strategy of bypassing the key early voting states where so many of the current candidates are devoting time, money and resources. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to get elected president by avoiding Iowa, by avoiding New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to buy this election by spending hundreds of millions of dollars on media in California. Those days are gone.\u201d Mr. Bloomberg on Friday took the first step toward a candidacy, filing paperwork to qualify for the ballot in Alabama. His looming entry into the race has underscored its fluidity while presenting the threat of a centrist competitor to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. As a leading progressive, Mr. Sanders could potentially benefit from a Bloomberg candidacy that siphoned voters from Mr. Biden. But Mr. Sanders displayed no eagerness to see Mr. Bloomberg in the race, and was quick to draw a direct contrast between their efforts, saying his campaign had the grass-roots support to win rather than billions of dollars in the bank. \u201cBloomberg can have his billions,\u201d he said, \u201cbut that is why we are going to win this election.\u201d The rally was Mr. Sanders\u2019s second public event of the day with Ms. Ocasio-Cortez of New York, who joined him on Friday for a two-day swing through the first-in-the-nation caucus state. During a rally in Council Bluffs on Friday, both progressive politicians largely avoided making any references to Mr. Bloomberg. Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s early moves, and his suggestion that he would follow the unconventional campaign strategy of skipping all four traditional early-state contests and instead stake his candidacy on delegate-rich primary states like California and Texas, has supplied fresh fodder for candidates like Mr. Sanders and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who are both campaigning on anti-elitist, progressive messages. Earlier in the day on Saturday, at a climate change forum in Des Moines, Mr. Sanders directed a more glancing blow at Mr. Bloomberg, saying the country needed \u201ca dynamic democracy \u2014 a democracy where all of us play a role in shaping public policy, not some billionaire who decides that he wants to run for president of the United States because he\u2019s a billionaire.\u201d Mr. Sanders also took a shot at Mr. Biden, who recently said he would be willing to accept support from a super PAC; his campaign, Mr. Sanders said, had no such financial vehicle.",

Kramer and Danny HakimPRINT EDITIONNovember 12, 2019",
      "author": "Sharon LaFraniere",
      "content": "   The origins of the impeachment inquiry engulfing President Trump and his administration go back to the election this spring of a new Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky. Over the next five months, White House emissaries pressured Mr. Zelensky to announce that Ukraine would investigate two matters: Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian gas company that hired Hunter Biden, the younger son of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., and whether Ukraine had meddled in the 2016 American presidential election. The demands alarmed numerous officials, including an intelligence officer who filed a whistle-blower complaint that eventually reached Congress and set off the impeachment inquiry. Volodymyr Zelensky is elected president of Ukraine. Soon after, allies of President Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani relay a message that Mr. Giuliani wants to meet with him. Mr. Zelensky puts him off, noting that he has not yet taken office. The State Department announces that Marie L. Yovanovitch, the American ambassador to Ukraine, has been recalled to Washington months ahead of schedule after Mr. Giuliani and his allies spread unfounded allegations that she was disloyal to Mr. Trump. About the same time, John R. Bolton, the White House national security adviser, warns a deputy: \u201cGiuliani\u2019s a hand grenade who\u2019s going to blow everybody up.\u201d Mr. Giuliani tells Fox News that Mr. Zelensky seems surrounded by operatives allied with the Democratic Party and \u201cenemies of the president, and, in some cases, enemies of the United States.\u201d A few days later, an associate of Mr. Giuliani\u2019s warns the Ukrainians that American aid could be withheld, according to the associate\u2019s lawyer, although others dispute that timing. In an Oval Office meeting with Mr. Trump, Kurt D. Volker, then the special envoy to Ukraine; Gordon D. Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union; and Rick Perry, the energy secretary, all describe Mr. Zelensky as a committed reformer who deserves American support. All three attended Mr. Zelensky\u2019s swearing-in in Kiev three days earlier. Mr. Trump replies that Ukraine is full of \u201cterrible\u201d and corrupt people who had \u201ctried to take me down.\u201d He orders the officials to coordinate future Ukraine matters with Mr. Giuliani. Later, Mr. Giuliani tells Mr. Sondland that the Ukrainians should publicly announce investigations into Burisma and the 2016 election. At the Trump International Hotel in Washington, Andriy Yermak, a top adviser to Mr. Zelensky, asks Mr. Volker to connect him to Mr. Giuliani. The two men later meet in Madrid. At a White House meeting later that day in Mr. Bolton\u2019s office, two Ukrainian officials press for an Oval Office meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky. Mr. Sondland blurts out that Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, promised that Mr. Zelensky would be invited if Ukraine announces \u201cinvestigations.\u201d Mr. Bolton halts the meeting. At a follow-up meeting, Mr. Sondland again presses the Ukrainians to announce investigations, this time specifying Burisma and the 2016 election as targets. Fiona Hill, one of Mr. Bolton\u2019s top deputies, calls that session to a halt. She and Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman, her subordinate, report the meetings to John A. Eisenberg, the chief legal adviser to the National Security Council. Mr. Bolton tells Ms. Hill to deliver a message from him: \u201cI am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up.\u201d In a secure conference call with national security officials, an Office of Management and Budget staff member announces that Mr. Trump was freezing $391 million in security aid to Ukraine until further notice, citing a presidential order to the budget office. During a phone call with Mr. Zelensky, Mr. Trump raises the favors he is seeking, including a Biden-related inquiry. Afterward, Mr. Vindman, one of the note-takers, reports the call to Mr. Eisenberg. The Ukrainians have learned by this date that military aid is frozen and they should speak with Mr. Mulvaney. \u201cI think POTUS really wants the deliverable,\u201d Mr. Sondland texts Mr. Volker. Mr. Sondland and Mr. Volker are working on draft language for Mr. Zelensky\u2019s announcement of the investigations. Mr. Yermak says the White House should nail down Mr. Zelensky\u2019s Oval Office invite first. A C.I.A. officer detailed to the White House files a whistle-blower complaint about the July 25 call and other concerns. It begins a slow trek to Congress. In a memo prepared for Mr. Bolton, Colonel Vindman states that the National Security Council, the State Department and the Defense Department all agree that military assistance to Ukraine should be released. But in a meeting, Mr. Trump rejects the recommendation. An aide later says the \u201cpresident doesn\u2019t want to provide any assistance at all.\u201d In Warsaw, Mr. Zelensky asks Vice President Mike Pence about the military aid, but Mr. Pence says only that he will speak to Mr. Trump. Mr. Sondland tells Mr. Yermak not to expect the money unless Mr. Zelensky publicly announces a Burisma investigation. Mr. Zelensky later prepares an announcement for a Sept. 13 CNN appearance, which the Ukrainians hope will satisfy Mr. Trump. Mr. Sondland calls Mr. Trump, asking specifically what he wants from Ukraine. Mr. Trump replies \u201cnothing\u201d and insists that there is \u201cno quid pro quo, \u201d Mr. Sondland later says. Two days after a House committee is notified of the whistle-blower complaint and opens an investigation, the White House reverses course and releases its hold on the military aid. Plans for Mr. Zelensky\u2019s CNN interview are scuttled. One day after Speaker Nancy Pelosi announces a formal impeachment inquiry, the White House releases a transcript of Mr. Trump\u2019s July 25 call with Mr. Zelensky. Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky hold a joint news conference at the United Nations during the General Assembly session. The whistle-blower complaint is delivered to Congress. The impeachment inquiry is scheduled to begin public hearings.",

Here\u2019s how it will unfold.By Nicholas FandosPRINT EDITIONAs New Phase Begins, Here\u2019s What to Expect From Televised Hearings|November 13, 2019, Page A18",
      "author": "Nicholas Fandos",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 House Democrats will convene open presidential impeachment hearings on Wednesday for only the third time in modern United States history, calling senior American diplomats to testify about President Trump\u2019s attempts to pressure a foreign power to publicly commit to investigate his political rivals. The hearings in the House Intelligence Committee are a major milestone in the impeachment inquiry the House started this fall. After seven weeks of fact-finding conducted almost exclusively in private, they will offer most Americans their first glimpse of House Democrats\u2019 case against Mr. Trump, and the administration witnesses whose accounts have bolstered it. They will almost certainly also elevate an ugly partisan fight over the inquiry that threatens to eclipse the facts themselves. Here is what you need to know before the hearings are gaveled in. At its simplest, Democrats\u2019 contention is that Mr. Trump abused the power of the presidency to enlist a foreign power to benefit his re-election campaign. That was the central charge of an anonymous C.I.A. whistle-blower whose complaint about the president\u2019s dealings with Ukraine prompted Speaker Nancy Pelosi to begin the impeachment inquiry. But the president\u2019s critics have begun sharpening their language to invoke terms like bribery, extortion and coercion against Mr. Trump, echoing the language in the Constitution that lays out offenses worthy of impeachment: \u201ctreason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.\u201d The centerpiece of their case is a reconstructed transcript released by the White House of a July phone call between Mr. Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. In it, Mr. Trump asked Mr. Zelensky, Ukraine\u2019s newly elected leader, to \u201cdo us a favor\u201d and investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son Hunter Biden as well as a conspiracy theory that holds that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered in the 2016 election to help Democrats, not Mr. Trump. The hearings are a chance for House Democrats, who have privately pieced together the back story of Mr. Trump\u2019s pressure campaign on Ukraine, to lay it out for the public. They will feature career diplomats with decades of experience describing what they viewed as an improper and dangerous shadow effort to inject Mr. Trump\u2019s political objectives into American foreign policymaking on Ukraine. In defiance of State Department orders not to cooperate, they are expected to say they know of no precedent for how Mr. Trump marginalized the American foreign policy apparatus in favor of a small group of political appointees and his private lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani, who did his bidding. The hearings will also give Republicans their first high-profile chance to defend the president. They plan to argue that Mr. Trump did nothing wrong in calling for the investigations, and that his objective was to root out corruption in Ukraine, rather than to bolster his own political fortunes. And Republicans plan to raise doubts about the witnesses, saying they are unelected bureaucrats who disagree with Mr. Trump and are trying to substitute their own judgment for his. First up will be a joint session at 10 a.m. Wednesday with William B. Taylor Jr., the top American diplomat in Ukraine, and George P. Kent, a senior State Department official in charge of Ukraine policy. On Friday, the same lawmakers will quiz Marie L. Yovanovitch, the former American ambassador to Kiev whom Mr. Trump abruptly recalled to Washington this spring. And the committee announced late Tuesday that it would hold three more days of hearings next week with eight additional witnesses from the diplomatic corps, the White House and the State Department. First, Mr. Taylor will testify in gripping terms about how he came to understand from officials speaking to the president this summer that Mr. Trump was escalating a pressure campaign on Ukraine, eventually using a coveted White House meeting for its new president and $391 million in security assistance for the country as leverage to secure the country\u2019s commitment that it would publicly announce investigations into former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and supposed Democratic collusion with Ukraine in 2016. Mr. Kent, the deputy assistant secretary of state in the Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs, watched with similar alarm. He will testify that he saw the push for investigations as \u201cinjurious to the rule of law,\u201d in the United States and Ukraine, and damaging to decades of American foreign policy. Ms. Yovanovitch will offer a more personal account of a smear campaign led by Mr. Giuliani and the corrupt former Ukrainian prosecutor general to portray her as disloyal to Mr. Trump. It worked, and she was abruptly recalled to Washington by Mr. Trump in May, prompting outcry within the State Department and widespread alarm. Democrats chose the vaulted, columned chambers of the Ways and Means Committee \u2014 the House\u2019s grandest hearing room \u2014 to serve as the backdrop for the hearings. They intend to take advantage of special rules changing the format of the questioning, too. The goal is to allow for longer, more detailed lines of questioning better suited to such a complicated and weighty subject than the typical five-minute bursts from lawmakers that make for pithy television sound bites, but yield less substantive responses. In the hearings beginning Wednesday, Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the Intelligence Committee chairman, and Representative Devin Nunes of California, the top Republican, plan to take advantage of extended blocks of questioning right off the bat. After the top lawmakers and witnesses deliver opening statements, Mr. Schiff will have 45 uninterrupted minutes to ask questions, followed by Mr. Nunes. Under the special rules that were adopted late last month for the inquiry by the House, Mr. Schiff and Mr. Nunes can delegate some or all of that time to their highly trained staff lawyers. After that, Democratic and Republican members of the committee will take turns asking questions in standard, five-minute rounds. Mr. Schiff and Mr. Nunes could start another 45-minute period of questioning once those are completed. Democrats expect the hearing to last anywhere from four and a half to six and a half hours. Democrats intend to turn to Daniel Goldman, a former federal prosecutor in New York who now serves as the Intelligence Committee\u2019s top investigator. The Republicans will most likely lean on Steve Castor, a congressional investigator who has worked in the House since 2005. Do not expect to see lawyers for the president on hand. Though the procedures adopted by the House grant Mr. Trump and his counsel the ability to recommend and cross-examine witnesses, as well as mount a defense, those rights only come later in the impeachment process. With the burden of proof on Democrats, the president\u2019s allies on Capitol Hill have a far easier job for now: to distract from and sow doubt about the strength of the evidence to ensure Republicans do not defect. They will do so with zeal. Staff for the inquiry circulated an 18-page memo to lawmakers on Tuesday laying out the road map for their defense, beginning with an accusation that Mr. Schiff has \u201cbroken\u201d a promise to treat Mr. Trump fairly. They will argue that Mr. Trump never pressured Mr. Zelensky, and that politics had nothing to do with his calls for investigations. \u201cThe body of evidence shows instead that President Trump holds a deep-seated, genuine and reasonable skepticism of Ukraine due to its history of pervasive corruption,\u201d Republicans wrote. \u201cDemocrats want to impeach President Trump because unelected and anonymous bureaucrats disagree with the president\u2019s decisions and were discomforted by his phone conversation with President Zelensky.\u201d The House is not impeaching Mr. Trump yet. Lawmakers are still in the investigative phase of their work. Because they are not relying on an independent investigative body, Mr. Schiff\u2019s committee has positioned itself as something akin to a grand jury, collecting the facts to bring charges against the president. The committee plans to write a report and present it to the House Judiciary Committee, where articles of impeachment are traditionally drafted and debated. Democratic leaders had hoped the Judiciary Committee could complete that work this year, but the timing remains unclear. If and when the Judiciary Committee receives a report, it could take several weeks to do its work. Ultimately, the committee will vote whether to recommend that the full House impeach Mr. Trump. If the House follows through, then the Senate must hold a trial to determine if Mr. Trump is innocent or guilty, in which case he would be removed.",

      "content": " The large field of Democrats running for president may have differing views on the best way to provide health care to the masses or exactly how to reform the immigration system. But when it comes to helping America\u2019s veterans they largely agree: The Department of Veterans Affairs needs some serious help, and those who have served need much better access to benefits, health care, housing, education and jobs. On Veterans Day, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont released extensive plans outlining how they would help them. They follow a similarly detailed proposal unveiled last week by Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and they join a lengthy list of policy plans released by candidates throughout the summer and fall. Here\u2019s a closer look at the measures Democrats are calling for, and how their proposals contrast with what President Trump has already done. Almost every candidate agrees that the V.A. needs to be able to function better than it currently does and has pledged to give the agency the resources it needs to work efficiently. Mr. Buttigieg, Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren are among those who have called for the agency to fill its more than 49,000 staffing vacancies. Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders, among others, have said they would invest in modernizing V.A. hospitals, clinics and other infrastructure. And in a commonly heard refrain, several Democrats have promised to eliminate the perennial \u201cbenefits backlog\u201d that forces tens of thousands of veterans to wait for a determination on the benefits they can receive. Mr. Buttigieg, a former Navy intelligence officer who served in Afghanistan, proposes making the V.A. apolitical \u201cby appointing leaders with relevant expertise and ensuring continuity in leadership across administrations.\u201d And in an interview with The Associated Press on Monday, he said he\u2019d seek to name a woman to head the agency for the first time. \u201cI think leadership plays a huge role, so, absolutely I\u2019d seek to name a woman to lead V.A.,\u201d he said. Several candidates have promised that under their administrations, veterans would get access to affordable and comprehensive health care. Under that umbrella, candidates like Mr. Sanders have specifically promised to guarantee dental care, expand the V.A.\u2019s comprehensive caregiver program and other measures. Multiple candidates also have called attention to veteran suicide and pledged to invest in research, mental health services and housing to help address the issue. Ms. Warren has said she would aim to reduce the number of veteran suicides by 50 percent within her first term. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey suggested appointing a White House official solely focused on working across agencies to cut the suicide rate. Senator Kamala Harris of California, meanwhile, is among those who have called for expanding access to health care and housing assistance for veterans with \u201cother-than-honorable\u201d discharges, which they may have received because they experienced trauma or other reasons beyond their control. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and other candidates have also outlined ways to support veterans once they re-enter civilian life. For instance, Ms. Klobuchar has proposed extending G.I. Bill education benefits to members of the National Guard and Reserve and implementing a grant program that would invest in veteran education centers. Several candidates have also said they would expand and improve incentives for companies to hire veterans, and that they would direct government agencies to invest in more veteran-owned businesses and entrepreneurship. The entrepreneur Andrew Yang has argued for what he calls a \u201creverse boot camp\u201d which would seek to help veterans adjust to life after the military by training them in skills like cooking, financial literacy and how to interview for a job. Candidates also promised to rescind Mr. Trump\u2019s ban on transgender servicemembers, stand up for victims of sexual assault in the military and protect veterans and family members of servicemembers from deportation. Ms. Warren has called the ban on transgender servicemembers \u201cshameful.\u201d And Mr. Buttigieg said his administration would reach out to people who were discharged because of their gender identity and give them a chance to re-enlist. Ms. Klobuchar said in her proposal that more than 20,000 servicemembers were sexually assaulted in 2018. She and other Democrats have proposed various ways to strengthen the prosecution of perpetrators and expand access to counseling for victims. In her plan, Ms. Warren noted that protections from deportation for veterans have been eroding under the Trump administration, and pledged to restart a program that makes it easier for noncitizens who serve to become naturalized. Mr. Trump, who kicked off the 100th annual New York City Veterans Day Parade in Manhattan on Monday, has also sought to court veterans, a group he views as a key piece of his political base. Public polls have found that Mr. Trump\u2019s support among veterans outpaces his support from the public at large. He has garnered praise from some veterans for railing against \u201cendless wars,\u201d much like the 2020 Democratic candidate Representative Tulsi Gabbard, a major in the Hawaii Army National Guard who has served two combat tours in the Middle East. Mr. Trump campaigned in 2016 on wanting to put more veterans in private health care. To help accomplish that goal, Congress passed health care legislation known as the Mission Act in 2018 and the V.A. rolled out new rules this year that allowed a broad group of enrollees to seek care outside the agency. Though Mr. Trump has heralded the program as great success, it has struggled to grow its network of doctors to meet coverage demands. For all his talk of supporting veterans, Mr. Trump has also sometimes snubbed them.He admitted in court documents that he gave his campaign control over how to spend $2.8 million that his charity raised through what was ostensibly a fund-raiser for veterans. Last year, he chose to forgo a traditional visit to Arlington National Cemetery on Veterans Day, a decision that led him to issue a rare apology. He drew wide condemnation during the 2016 campaign when he criticized the parents of a slain soldier who had denounced him, and he frequently attacked the late Senator John McCain, saying the former Navy pilot and prisoner of war was \u201cnot a war hero.\u201d ",

And his work helps shape how millions of Americans understand this moment.By Jeremy W. Peters and Kenneth P. VogelPRINT EDITIONFox News Face  And Key Figure In Investigation|November 13, 2019, Page A1",
      "author": "Jeremy W. Peters",
      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 In weeks of closed-door testimony, American officials who worked in Ukraine kept circling back to the work of one journalist, John Solomon, whose articles they said appeared to have considerable currency with President Trump\u2019s inner circle. They had never known Mr. Solomon to be an authority on Ukrainian politics before, and certainly not someone with particular insights into the American ambassador to Ukraine who was a frequent target of his. So when Rudolph W. Giuliani, Donald Trump Jr. and the president himself started talking about his stories, those officials began closely following what he wrote. Asked how she first learned of Mr. Giuliani\u2019s interest in Ukraine, Fiona Hill, Mr. Trump\u2019s former adviser on Russia and Europe, replied, in part, \u201cJohn Solomon.\u201d Mr. Solomon has been a surprisingly central figure in the impeachment proceedings so far. But the glare has not been so kind. One witness testified to Congress that an article of his was full of \u201cnon-truths and non sequiturs.\u201d Another witness said that he could not recall a single thing that was correct in one of Mr. Solomon\u2019s stories, then added sarcastically, \u201cHis grammar might have been right.\u201d So who exactly is John Solomon? A Washington-based reporter and Fox News personality who had until recently been working at the politics outlet The Hill, Mr. Solomon, 52, is not well known outside conservative media. But, according to interviews and testimony, his writing and commentary helped trigger the chain of events that are now the subject of the impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump. Though he worked for years at The Associated Press and briefly at The Washington Post, he moved on from mainstream outlets and now sits at the center of a network of conservative journalists, radio hosts, cable news pundits and activists whose work reaches millions of Americans every day, and shapes the way a large swath of the country sees this pivotal moment. Understanding their work is key to explaining how Mr. Trump\u2019s approval ratings remain so durable with his base \u2014 and why, as some polls suggest, far more direct and damaging evidence would have to emerge from the impeachment hearings that begin their public phase on Wednesday for that support to crack. According to transcripts released last week, Mr. Solomon and his pieces for The Hill are a focus for congressional investigators as they look into Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to push Ukrainian officials to investigate his rivals. One particular area of interest for Democrats, the transcripts show, is Mr. Solomon\u2019s role in advancing claims by Mr. Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal attorney, that former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his family deserved to be investigated for their own dealings in Ukraine. In an interview, Mr. Giuliani said he turned to Mr. Solomon earlier this year with a cache of information he believed contained damaging details about Mr. Biden, his son, Hunter Biden, and the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election. \u201cI really turned my stuff over to John Solomon,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said. \u201cI had no other choice,\u201d he added, asserting that Obama-era officials still \u201cinfected\u201d the Justice Department and wouldn\u2019t have diligently investigated the information he had compiled. \u201cSo I said here\u2019s the way to do it \u2014 I\u2019m going to give it to the watchdogs of integrity, the fourth estate,\u201d he said. Mr. Solomon\u2019s work has been endorsed by some of the most influential figures on the right like Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh and the president, who has highlighted Mr. Solomon\u2019s articles on Twitter. Mark Levin, the radio and Fox host, recently said that Mr. Solomon and Sara Carter, a journalist with whom he frequently appears on television, were \u201clike the Woodward and Bernsteins of our time.\u201d Media scholars describe the environment that has elevated Mr. Solomon\u2019s stories as an information ecosystem entirely sealed off from other news coverage. Nicole Hemmer, a historian at Columbia University who studies the conservative media, said people often mistakenly refer to the Fox News-talk radio world as an \u201cecho chamber\u201d of opinion when in fact it is more like \u201can interconnected set of authorities.\u201d \u201cSean Hannity talks about John Solomon,\u201d she said, \u201cand then that gets picked up on Rush and Levin.\u201d The effect, she added, is that his reporting carries weight with conservative audiences. \u201cThat gives it an authority when they\u2019re hearing it from multiple sources every day.\u201d When Mr. Solomon appears on television and the radio, Mr. Hannity and other conservative hosts often identify him as an investigative reporter and cite his decades of experience at news organizations like The A.P. But his critics see this as a sleight of hand to give his writing a veneer of nonpartisan objectivity. \u201cPart of the issue is that for years he was identified with the mainstream media,\u201d said James Manley, a former aide to Harry Reid, the former Senate majority leader who tangled with Mr. Solomon in the 2000s over stories insinuating Mr. Reid had benefited inappropriately from his office. The Columbia Journalism Review later singled out Mr. Solomon\u2019s reporting, saying it was \u201cmuch ado about very little.\u201d An examination of Mr. Solomon\u2019s reporting methods and interviews with people who have worked with him during his decades-long career in Washington show that his techniques blur the boundaries meant to keep journalist-source relationships at an arm\u2019s length. And for some of his biggest stories on Ukraine, he has relied on a prosecutor with a history of making inconsistent statements who is now under criminal investigation. At one point while he was employed as a columnist for The Hill and publishing regular pieces favorable to the president, Mr. Solomon discussed with colleagues a proposal to create a transparency office in the Trump White House. Some colleagues believed he might have wanted to run this office, according to a person with direct knowledge of the situation. (Unlike Fox, The Hill put a disclaimer over Mr. Solomon\u2019s writing indicating that it was opinion starting in May of 2018 after complaints from colleagues about what they saw as one-sidedness in his work, The Post reported at the time.) Mr. Solomon denied that he has ever sought work in any administration and said the transparency office proposal had \u201cnothing to do with seeking a job.\u201d He added, \u201cIt had to do with fostering an idea for more transparency.\u201d As for the attacks on his work from the impeachment witnesses, he said, \u201cThe N.S.C. and State officials are entitled to their opinions of my reporting.\u201d A close look at one piece by Mr. Solomon shows how far one of his assertions, later called into doubt, can reverberate at the highest levels of the government. In late March, Mr. Solomon and his team published pieces in The Hill making sensational claims of misconduct at the State Department: The American ambassador to Ukraine, a career foreign service officer who assumed her post during the Obama administration, had privately bad-mouthed Mr. Trump and, separately, had previously provided to Yuriy Lutsenko, Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general at the time, a list of individuals that Mr. Lutsenko should not prosecute. In conservative circles, where suspicion of anti-Trump officials working inside the government runs high, the allegation fit with the narrative that institutions like the State Department are rife with bad actors. But there was less to the do-not-prosecute list than it appeared. The State Department dismissed it as \u201can outright fabrication.\u201d Mr. Lutsenko changed his story and acknowledged that what he is quoted describing in Mr. Solomon\u2019s report \u2014 \u201ca list of people whom we should not prosecute\u201d given to him by the ambassador \u2014 did not actually exist. In an interview with The New York Times last month, Mr. Lutsenko blamed the confusion on the interpreter who handled his interview with The Hill. But he insisted that the ambassador, Marie Yovanovitch, had in fact asked him not to target certain politicians and activists who worked with the embassy on its anti-corruption efforts. But among Mr. Trump\u2019s allies and media boosters, the story line was set: A corrupt ambassador who did not like the president was misusing her authority to protect her friends. In the whistle-blower complaint that set off the impeachment inquiry, those articles and others by Mr. Solomon are cited as among the key events leading up to Mr. Trump\u2019s demand that the Ukranians do him \u201ca favor\u201d and investigate the Bidens. Mr. Solomon said in an email that Mr. Lutsenko was adamant he had not changed his story when the two spoke for a follow-up interview. The back-and-forth over the existence of a formal list, he said, is a \u201cclassic he-said, she-said dispute,\u201d which he believes his coverage accurately reflected. \u201cThe idea I should have some regret for accurately quoting a major news figure in Ukraine is preposterous,\u201d he said. The \u201cdon\u2019t prosecute\u201d story gained considerable traction in conservative media. It drew the attention of the president\u2019s son, Donald Trump Jr., who in March tweeted that Ms. Yovanovitch was a \u201cjoker\u201d who shouldn\u2019t be in the job. In May, the Trump administration recalled her from her position. In his testimony, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council, seemed alarmed at how quickly Mr. Solomon\u2019s story was amplified by high-profile figures like Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Trump\u2019s son. He testified that the entire thing \u201csmelled really rotten.\u201d Mr. Solomon grew up in Connecticut where his father was a police officer and later served as chief of police for the town of Easton. Before working for conservative outlets, he held senior reporting jobs at a number of mainstream organizations, including The A.P., where he worked for almost 20 years, and The Post, where he pursued investigative projects that often focused on federal law enforcement. Mr. Solomon won an award in 2002 for coordinating the A.P.\u2019s investigations into the law enforcement failures that preceded the Sept. 11 attacks. He joined The Post in 2007 but stayed only a short period before leaving for the Washington Times, telling his bosses that he could not pass up the large salary the conservative paper was offering. His work at The Hill since 2017 has generated the most notice and controversy of his career. His reporting was of considerable value to the outlet\u2019s publisher, James Finkelstein, who has been friends with Mr. Trump for decades and saw Mr. Solomon as a high-profile hire whose frequent Fox News appearances could help generate buzz and traffic for the website. While Mr. Solomon was at The Hill, his relationships with sources were sometimes closer than reporters typically get with the people they cover. In March, according to documents uncovered as part of the impeachment inquiry, he shared a draft of one of his stories before publication with a noteworthy group: people who had helped gather the information that Mr. Giuliani had provided to Mr. Solomon. They included Victoria Toensing and Joe diGenova, two lawyers who have been working with Mr. Giuliani to undermine the investigations into Mr. Trump, and Lev Parnas, a Ukrainian-American businessman who helped connect Mr. Giuliani to Mr. Lutsenko. Mr. Solomon said \u201cI do go over stories in advance\u201d with sources for accuracy, not to tip them off to the content. Mr. Solomon left The Hill in September under circumstances that neither he nor the paper have fully described. He has not said what his new venture will be \u2014 or how it is being funded \u2014 other than to describe it to former colleagues as a media start-up. For the time being, he is publishing his work on his personal website. His slogan is \u201cReporting Truth.\u201d",

Bloomberg is poised to enter a race that has many voters anxious and searching for the perfect candidate. But do they need yet one more option?By Sydney Ember and Jonathan MartinPRINT EDITIONBloomberg Nudges Into a Field Chock Full of Not-So-Sure Bets|November 10, 2019, Page A1",
      "author": "Sydney Ember",
      "content": "  COUNCIL BLUFFS, Iowa \u2014 Jackie Wellman worries that Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are too liberal to defeat President Trump, thinks Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., may be too inexperienced and, while she is fond of Joseph R. Biden Jr., she is also uneasy about his tendency to misspeak. \u201cI am worried about the top four candidates because they all have issues,\u201d said Ms. Wellman, a 54-year-old Iowa caucusgoer from West Des Moines who likes Senator Amy Klobuchar. Ms. Wellman is not the only Democrat who keeps finding flaws as she searches for the best candidate to win the White House. \u201cVoters are holding back because just when they start to fall in love, they find something that gets them a little nervous,\u201d former Mayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago said. \u201cThe reason it\u2019s so fluid is because they\u2019re still searching for the horse that can win.\u201d\n\nMichael R. Bloomberg believes that may be him. But Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s apparent decision to mount a late entry into the presidential race represents something more than just the robust self-confidence of a New York City billionaire; it\u2019s a manifestation of the Democratic angst that has been growing, particularly among moderate voters and party establishment figures. Mr. Bloomberg has jolted the Democratic primary, drawing fire from the leading liberals in the field who said he was trying to buy the presidency while posing a direct threat to the centrist candidacy of Mr. Biden. But he has also exposed the jitters among establishment-aligned Democrats who fear that the leftward turn of the party is endangering their chances of building a winning coalition.\n\nFor weeks, senior Democratic officials and donors have been musing about whether a new candidate could be lured in the race, a striking illustration of nervousness just three months before the Iowa caucuses. Some talked up Mr. Bloomberg and Hillary Clinton, but others wondered if Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio might make a late entry to unite a party splintered along ideological lines. And while some party leaders have muted their concerns in an effort to be neutral, that restraint has started to give way to open expressions of alarm. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has been repeating the same mantra \u2014 \u201cRemember November\u201d \u2014 in private about focusing on winning the general election, and has told Democratic allies she was uneasy about a nominee running on Medicare for all. In an interview last week with Bloomberg News, the San Francisco-based speaker let her concerns slip, saying that creating government-run health care \u201cwould increase the vote in my own district, but that\u2019s not what we need to do in order to win the Electoral College.\u201d Many voters are just as uneasy. \u201cI like Elizabeth Warren,\u201d said Janet Mayo-Smith, 64, who was attending an event for Mr. Biden in Franklin, N.H., on Friday, before adding that she had concerns about whether Ms. Warren was too \u201cradical\u201d to win. She expressed some openness to Mr. Bloomberg, calling him \u201ca good candidate\u201d but also noting that it was late to join the race. Stanley Brown, 49, also from New Hampshire,  called Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s move \u201cinteresting.\u2019\u2019 Asked if there were too many voices in the race already, he replied \u201cno such thing.\u2019\u2019 \u201cI\u2019d consider anybody,\u201d he said. Yet if there is consensus around the high priority of finding the strongest candidate to take on Mr. Trump, there is less agreement among rank-and-file voters that the party needs a white knight to enter the race and rescue them. Interviews with Democrats across four states on Friday showed that many were content to pick from those who remained in the sprawling field. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what his logic is exactly,\u201d Ricky Hurtado, who attended a Hispanic voters forum in North Carolina that featured Ms. Warren, said of Mr. Bloomberg. Ticking through a number of the leading Democrats in the race, Mr. Hurtado, who is running for the state legislature next year, said, \u201cI think we have enough voices in the primary right now covering the majority of the spectrum in the Democratic Party.\u201d In New Hampshire, where Mr. Biden and the businessman Andrew Yang were at the statehouse on a frosty day, filing paperwork to be on the state\u2019s primary ballot, voters mostly shrugged about Mr. Bloomberg, who on Friday filed paperwork to qualify for the Alabama primary. A few groused about a bloated field getting bigger. Carolyn Stiles, 75, said she worried that such a large field would make it difficult for Democrats to unify behind one candidate, and described Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s potential entrance into the race as \u201cunhelpful.\u201d She said she was considering Mr. Biden, Ms. Warren and Senator Kamala Harris. To some center-left Democratic candidates in the race, though, a Bloomberg bid could prove more than unhelpful. Were he to finance a major advertising campaign, he could siphon support, news media attention and ultimately votes from the more moderate candidates, clearing a path for Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren. \u201cI don\u2019t know who he hurts but it\u2019s not going to be Bernie or Elizabeth,\u201d said Senator Amy Klobuchar, who is hoping to establish herself in Iowa as a centrist alternative to Mr. Biden. \u201cWe don\u2019t need another billionaire,\u201d she added. Representative Cedric Richmond of Louisiana, a co-chair of Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign, was even blunter. \u201cIt takes a whole lot of moxie to look at the Democratic field and say, \u2018None of them can be president and I\u2019ll enter the race and be the savior,\u2019\u201d Mr. Richmond said. \u201cWhat does Bloomberg offer that\u2019s different? It\u2019s not like he\u2019s 27 \u2014 he\u2019s 77.\u201d Mr. Bloomberg may not prove to be the tonic the party is looking for. His record on policing and economic issues, and his skepticism about the #MeToo movement, could alienate large swaths of the Democratic electorate. And he is choosing an unconventional path in the primary; his advisers signaled Friday that if he runs he\u2019s unlikely to compete in the first four states. But it is clear enough why he is tempted to run. Mr. Biden\u2019s unsteady performances in debates and on the campaign trail have undermined confidence in his ability to beat the president. They have hurt Mr. Biden\u2019s fund-raising and early-state polling while exacerbating what may be his biggest liability \u2014 that at 76, he may not be nimble enough to beat an unpredictable figure like Mr. Trump. Mr. Buttigieg is gaining support in Iowa, but polls show he has yet to draw any sizable support from nonwhite Democrats. On the other flank of the party, Democrats are eyeing Mr. Sanders, a 78-year-old democratic socialist who just suffered a heart attack, and Ms. Warren, who is tightening her embrace around a pricey single-payer health care proposal that would terminate private insurance plans. Both candidates have large and devoted followings, but Democrats have not put forward avowedly liberal presidential nominees in decades; a new New York Times/Siena College poll showing Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders losing to Mr. Trump in some battleground states only further frayed nerves. \u201cThat frightened a lot of people,\u201d Terry McAuliffe, the former governor of Virginia and D.N.C. chair, said of the survey. Then came Tuesday\u2019s elections, in which Democrats had great success with mostly moderate candidates who posted large margins in suburban jurisdictions \u2014 heightening the conviction among many that the party needed a centrist standard-bearer. Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s prospective run has mostly agitated Mr. Biden\u2019s supporters, who were already on edge over his fund-raising troubles, his dip in the polls in Iowa and Mr. Trump\u2019s unrelenting assault on him and his son Hunter.\n\n \u201cI don\u2019t like that,\u201d Marge Cudney, who came to celebrate Mr. Biden\u2019s filing for the New Hampshire primary, said of Mr. Bloomberg. \u201cHe\u2019s going to divide the team and will weaken everybody. I think he could pull some people away.\u201d Yet two former lawmakers who are supporting Mr. Biden \u2014 Ed Rendell of Pennsylvania and Bob Kerrey, a former senator and governor of Nebraska \u2014 spoke favorably about Mr. Bloomberg and said they would be comfortable with him as a candidate if Mr. Biden faltered. \u201cI\u2019m for Joe,\u201d Mr. Rendell said, \u201cbut if something were to happen where Joe was no longer a candidate, which I don\u2019t believe is going to happen, I would enthusiastically consider the mayor as a good strong candidate, and I think he\u2019d make a fine president.\u201d And not every voter dismissed Mr. Bloomberg, whose advisers believe will be viewed more favorably once Democrats nationally become more familiar with his business career and record as mayor. Bryant Tolles, 80, of Concord, N.H., gave Mr. Bloomberg high marks for his political experience. \u201cI\u2019m glad he entered the race,\u201d said Mr. Tolles, who is undecided, adding, \u201cThey need another centrist who can appeal to the broad electorate.\u201d For all the heartburn in a party that is often given to indigestion about its presidential field, polls show that Democrats are generally pleased with their options. In a Monmouth University poll released this week, roughly three-quarters of Democratic voters said they were satisfied with the field, while just 16 percent said they were not. Moderate and conservative Democrats were more likely to say they wished someone new would get in the race, but only 22 percent of them expressed discontent with their choices. What is more revealing is how many in the party are not yet settled on a candidate: The Times/Siena poll of Iowa, where voters are paying closest attention to the race, found that roughly two-thirds of likely caucusgoers could still be persuaded to change their minds.\n\nThe ranks of the undecided include Alan Seabrooke, 89, of Elgin, Iowa, who said, \u201cIf you get somebody too far to the left, it scares people.\u201d Alex Stroda, a 40-year-old from Ottumwa, Iowa, who called himself a \u201cleftist libertarian,\u201d was just as concerned about 2020 but for the opposite reason: He thinks too many of the candidates are not progressive enough. Mr. Stroda, a former vice chair of the Wapello County Democrats, who is considering Mr. Sanders, Ms. Warren and Mr. Yang, dismissed the logic behind a Bloomberg candidacy. \u201cThis notion that he needs to ride in on a white horse and save the Democratic Party from somebody who is too left-wing,\u201d he said, \u201cis just an extension of the problem we have understanding politics in America, where we have the Democrats tacking to the right as the Republicans tack farther and farther right.\u201d",

      "author": "Katie Glueck",
      "content": " COLUMBUS, Ohio \u2014 A day after their fiercest debate-stage confrontation to date, Joseph R. Biden Jr. escalated his criticism of his most formidable rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, suggesting that she was not being forthright about the costs of her far-reaching policy proposals and questioning her \u201ccredibility.\u201d Mr. Biden zeroed in on Ms. Warren\u2019s refusal to say if she would raise taxes on middle-class Americans to pay for \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d a single-payer health care system that would all but eliminate private health insurance. While other candidates are pouncing on that issue as well, Mr. Biden is under particular pressure because Ms. Warren has passed him in some national and early-state polls and joined him as a front-runner, a status he held alone for months. \u201cIt\u2019s fascinating that the person who has a plan for everything has no plan for the single most consequential issue in this election in the minds of the American people across the board,\u201d Mr. Biden said, addressing reporters on a cold, gray afternoon outside a union electrical trade center. \u201cAnd, you know, credibility matters. It matters. And the question that I think that Senator Warren is going to have to face, she\u2019s going to have to tell the truth or the question will be raised about whether or not she\u2019s going to be candid and honest with the American people,\u201d he said. He noted that she supports several ambitious proposals, including a tax on the wealth of the richest Americans, and said she should be pressed for details on how to implement them. \u201cThe last thing the Democrats should be doing is playing Trump\u2019s game, trying to con the American people to think this is easy,\u201d Mr. Biden said. Ms. Warren\u2019s team did not respond directly to Mr. Biden\u2019s attacks on policy matters, instead skewering his campaign\u2019s reliance on high-dollar fund-raising events. \u201cInstead of speaking to wealthy donors, our campaign spent the day calling and thanking over a thousand of our grass-roots supporters,\u201d said Kristen Orthman, the communications director for Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign. \u201cOther than that we have no comment.\u201d Mr. Biden and his allies have been previewing attacks on Ms. Warren for more than a month, swiping at her affection for sweeping policy plans and casting them as unrealistic or polarizing. But at last month's presidential debate, the two barely clashed. That dynamic changed dramatically on Tuesday, when Mr. Biden accused Ms. Warren of \u201cbeing vague\u201d in her proposals. Ms. Warren went on to detail her work in helping to create the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau under the Obama administration, leading to a tense exchange with Mr. Biden, who was vice president at the time. \u201cI went out on the floor and got you votes,\u201d Mr. Biden said, his voice rising and hand pointing in Ms. Warren\u2019s direction. \u201cSo let\u2019s get those things straight, too.\u201d Mr. Biden is now confronting a series of challenges: a third-quarter fund-raising haul that fell well behind the totals of Ms. Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont; struggles in some early state polls; and scrutiny on his family after revelations that President Trump asked the Ukrainian government to investigate Mr. Biden and his son Hunter. There is no evidence that Mr. Biden, as vice president, acted improperly to aid his son\u2019s overseas business dealings, but the development has emerged as a major distraction to his campaign, though his national polling numbers have generally remained steady since the Ukraine controversy broke last month. On Wednesday, Mr. Biden again sought to put that story line behind him, repeatedly working to bring the focus back to Mr. Trump and casting him as dangerous and corrupt. \u201cMr. President, release your tax returns or shut up,\u201d he said at one point, looking directly into the assembled cameras. And Mr. Biden, who often talks about civility, appeared far more eager to seize opportunities to tweak his Democratic rivals than he has on many previous occasions. \u201cGod love Bernie, you know it was really good, I really mean it, to see him so healthy and moving last night,\u201d Mr. Biden said of Mr. Sanders, who recently suffered a heart attack. \u201cBut Bernie! Bernie doesn\u2019t pay for half his plan.\u201d Asked about Ms. Warren\u2019s remark at the debate, that the United States should \u201cget out of the Middle East,\u201d Mr. Biden, a former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, embraced the chance to attempt to draw another contrast. \u201cI quite frankly was surprised,\u201d he said. \u201cI have never heard anyone say, with any serious background in foreign policy, that we pull all troops out of the Middle East.\u201d Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign has clarified that she was referring to combat troops. Later Wednesday, Mr. Biden gave a foreign policy address in Iowa where he briefly referenced that moment, again noting his surprise at her remarks before turning back to his foreign policy agenda. To some extent, Mr. Biden\u2019s attack is part of a broader effort to cast himself as uniquely qualified on foreign policy, an argument he made explicitly in his speech in Iowa. \u201cTrump is demolishing the moral authority of the United States of America,\u201d he said, and the next president will have to handle foreign relations in \u201cwhatever the state of disarray Trump leaves it in.\u201d \u201cWe need a leader who can on Day 1 pick up the phone, call our NATO allies, know them by their first names, and know and have them know there will be no question about the word of the next president of the United States,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cI\u2019ve personally met and built relationships with almost every world leader that\u2019s still on the stage.\u201d",

Biden Jr. escalated the war of words between the two leading Democratic candidates, painting Elizabeth Warren as unwilling to accept criticism of her plans.By Katie GlueckPRINT EDITIONBiden Attacks Warren as a \u2018Condescending\u2019 Elitist|November 6, 2019, Page A14",
      "author": "Katie Glueck",
      "content": " Joseph R. Biden Jr. unfurled sharply personal new lines of attack against Senator Elizabeth Warren on Tuesday, questioning her contributions to the Democratic Party and seeking to cast her as an elitist who believes people lack courage or wisdom unless they agree with her. \u201cSome call it the \u2018my way or the highway\u2019 approach to politics,\u201d Mr. Biden, the former vice president, wrote in a Medium post. \u201cBut it\u2019s worse than that. It\u2019s condescending to the millions of Democrats who have a different view. It\u2019s representative of an elitism that working and middle-class people do not share: \u2018We know best; you know nothing.\u2019 \u2018If you were only as smart as I am you would agree with me.\u2019 This is no way to get anything done.\u201d Mr. Biden repeated similar arguments in a fund-raising email and at a fund-raiser in Pittsburgh on Tuesday, escalating tensions between the two top-polling contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination. He did not mention his rival by name, but the message was unmistakably aimed at Ms. Warren, whose Republican critics have for years sought to paint her as an out-of-touch liberal who worked as a Harvard professor. Ms. Warren is running as a corruption-battling economic populist, and her campaign has emphasized that she grew up in Oklahoma \u201con the ragged edge of the middle-class.\u201d Her campaign declined to comment on Mr. Biden\u2019s remarks. Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren have clashed repeatedly over health care, especially as Ms. Warren has overtaken Mr. Biden in some early-state polls. Ms. Warren supports \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d an expansive government-run health insurance system that would all but eliminate private health insurance, while Mr. Biden wants to add a \u201cpublic option\u201d to build on the Affordable Care Act, but still allow people to choose private insurance. Last week, after Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign criticized Ms. Warren\u2019s proposal to pay for Medicare for all, she suggested that Mr. Biden was \u201crunning in the wrong presidential primary.\u201d \u201cDemocrats are not going to win by repeating Republican talking points and by dusting off the points of view of the giant insurance companies and the giant drug companies who don\u2019t want to see any change in the law that will bite into their profit,\u201d she said. Her message drew a pointed rebuke from Mr. Biden, who wrote that such remarks \u201creflect an angry unyielding viewpoint that has crept into our politics. If someone doesn\u2019t agree with you \u2014 it\u2019s not just that you disagree \u2014 that person must be a coward or corrupt or a small thinker.\u201d Some of Ms. Warren\u2019s other opponents, including Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., have also been critical of Ms. Warren\u2019s health care proposal, and of her approach to promoting it. In several venues on Tuesday, Mr. Biden also repeatedly seized on the fact that Ms. Warren was once a registered Republican, though she is now a leading progressive contender for the Democratic nomination and Mr. Biden is perceived by many on the left as too moderate and overly focused on striking deals with Republicans. \u201cI have fought for the Democratic Party my whole career,\u201d Mr. Biden wrote. \u201cI know what we stand for, who we stand with and what we believe. And it\u2019s not just policies or issues. It\u2019s in my bones. That\u2019s not something everyone in this primary can say.\u201d He was more explicit at the fund-raiser: \u201cI\u2019ve been a Democrat my whole life. This person has only fairly recently in the mid-\u201990s become a Democrat.\u201d Ms. Warren\u2019s team has in the past been critical of Mr. Biden\u2019s reliance on high-dollar fund-raising events. Mr. Biden and his allies often bristle at the suggestion that he is insufficiently progressive for this moment in the Democratic Party, and Mr. Biden on Tuesday sought to defend his liberal credentials on issues like health care and taxes. But his use of personal criticisms to confront Ms. Warren, the only woman polling in the top tier of Democratic contenders, carries risk. Attacks on character, including on Mr. Biden\u2019s, have often failed to land or have backfired in the primary process so far. Mr. Biden cast his remarks as self-defense. \u201cSince some have questioned whether I\u2019m running in the wrong primary \u2014 let me answer that question,\u201d he continued. \u201cI\u2019m running in the Democratic primary as a proud Democrat.\u201d",

      "author": "Linda Qiu",
      "content": " President Trump and his supporters have tried out a variety of talking points defending his attempts to press the Ukrainian government to open investigations that would benefit him politically. As the public phase of the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry begins on Wednesday, here are some of the most common rationales Republicans are putting forward to argue Mr. Trump\u2019s actions are not impeachable, and how they stack up against the facts. Mr. Trump himself is the most vocal proponent of this shoot-the-messenger defense. He has falsely claimed at least two dozen times that the whistle-blower complaint that spurred the impeachment inquiry was \u201cinaccurate,\u201d \u201cfalse\u201d or \u201ca lie.\u201d In fact, the White House released a reconstructed transcript of the president\u2019s phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine that corroborated much of what the whistle-blower reported. Witness testimony has also backed up and fleshed out the whistle-blower\u2019s main points. Mr. Trump has also accused Mark Zaid, a lawyer for the whistle-blower, of planning to \u201coverthrow\u201d the president, pointing to a 2017 Twitter post as proof. In the tweet, Mr. Zaid said a \u201ccoup\u201d had started and impeachment would follow, in reaction to Mr. Trump firing Sally Q. Yates as acting attorney general. (Mr. Zaid told The Times last week that his tweet was taken out of context and that he had also represented the Republican National Committee.) The whistle-blower cannot be trusted, according to Mr. Trump, because he or she is a \u201cstrong Democrat.\u201d While Michael Atkinson, the inspector general for the intelligence community, has said the whistle-blower showed \u201carguable political bias\u201d in favor of a rival candidate, that did not alter Mr. Atkinson\u2019s conclusion that the complaint was credible. Mr. Trump has also branded several officials who have testified before Congress as \u201cNever Trumpers.\u201d Speaking about Gordon D. Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union, who donated $1 million to the president\u2019s inauguration committee, Mr. Trump said this month that \u201cI hardly know the gentleman\u201d \u2014 despite having called Mr. Sondland \u201ca really good man and great American\u201d and \u201chighly respected\u201d last month. For weeks, Mr. Trump and his allies have aimed to hammer home this simple defense: there was no quid pro quo linking American military aid to Ukraine with investigations the president sought into the son of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., a leading Democratic presidential candidate, and the conspiracy theory that it was Ukraine, not Russia, that hacked the Democratic National Committee in 2016. This talking point was undercut by Mick Mulvaney, Mr. Trump\u2019s acting chief of staff, when he acknowledged a tie between the aid and the investigations in an October news conference and then retracted his statement the same day. Democrats have also seized upon four words uttered by Mr. Trump in the White House\u2019s reconstructed transcript of the call \u2014 \u201cdo us a favor\u201d \u2014 to argue that an exchange of benefits was clearly established. As an addendum, Mr. Trump has repeatedly cited Mr. Zelensky\u2019s denial that he felt pressured as evidence of their \u201cperfect call.\u201d William B. Taylor Jr., the top American diplomat in Ukraine, suggested otherwise when he testified to Congress that a national security adviser to Mr. Zelensky told him that the Ukrainian president \u201cdid not want to be used as a pawn in a U.S. re-election campaign.\u201d This argument \u2014 that Ukraine had been unaware that military aid had been withheld so it was impossible that Mr. Trump had conditioned its release on Ukraine opening certain investigations \u2014 has been employed by several Republican lawmakers as well as Donald Trump Jr., the president\u2019s eldest son, with varying degrees of accuracy. \u201cFirst of all, because nothing was withheld. The other guy on the other side actually said, \u2018I have no idea what you\u2019re talking about.\u2019 No one knew any aid was even being withheld,\u201d the younger Mr. Trump said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThe View\u201d last week. \u201cThe president was pressuring for investigation but there was no quo. The Ukrainian leader did nothing different to actually get the aid,\u201d Representative Don Bacon of Nebraska said in late October. Representative John Ratcliffe of Texas focused on the timing of the president\u2019s call with Mr. Zelensky. \u201cNeither Zelensky or any Ukrainian was aware there was a hold on military aid on July 25,\u201d Mr. Ratcliffe said last month, adding that \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter\u201d that the Ukrainians learned about it later. First, it\u2019s not true that \u201cnothing was withheld.\u201d The White House disclosed on July 18 in a secure call with national security officials that it was freezing the aid, and did not release it until Sept. 11, after coming under bipartisan pressure from Congress. Mr. Zelensky may have been unaware that of the aid freeze during the July 25 call, but his top aides had learned that Mr. Trump was seeking the investigations before the phone conversation. Mr. Taylor and two others \u2014 Fiona Hill, Mr. Trump\u2019s former top Russia adviser, and Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman, the top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council \u2014 have all testified that in a July 10 meeting with top Ukrainian officials, Mr. Sondland said that securing an Oval Office meeting between the two presidents would require a commitment from Ukraine to pursue the investigations. The New York Times has reported that some Ukrainian officials had learned of the aid freeze by the first week of August, and the whistle-blower\u2019s account said he had heard as of \u201cearly August\u201d that some Ukrainian officials were aware the aid might be in jeopardy. Mr. Zelensky has said he raised the issue with Vice President Mike Pence in a Sept. 1 meeting. According to Mr. Taylor, Mr. Sondland told a top aide to Mr. Zelensky that the \u201csecurity assistance money would not come\u201d until Kiev committed to pursuing the investigation into Mr. Biden\u2019s son. (This was also corroborated by Mr. Sondland.) It\u2019s also not true that Mr. Zelensky \u201cdid nothing different\u201d in an attempt to release the aid. He had agreed to appear on CNN on Sept. 13 and announce the investigations Mr. Trump had sought; that ultimately did not happen, but only because the White House released the aid. Allies of Mr. Trump have brushed aside the testimonies of Mr. Taylor and Mr. Sondland as mere speculation, not proof. Their argument is that there is no justification for impeachment \u201cbased on somebody saying they presumed and someone else saying they interpreted,\u201d Kellyanne Conway, the White House counselor, said last week. \u201cBill Taylor\u2019s presumption of the president\u2019s involvement or whatever came from a media story,\u201d Representative Doug Collins, Republican of Georgia, said last Wednesday on Fox News. \u201cHe pointed to Mr. Giuliani, he didn\u2019t point to the president.\u201d That media story was a New York Times report in May that detailed efforts by Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, to press Ukraine into investigating Mr. Biden\u2019s son and the theory that origin of the special counsel inquiry into Russia\u2019s interference in 2016. Mr. Giuliani told The Times\u2019s Kenneth P. Vogel that Mr. Trump supported his actions and \u201cbasically knows what I\u2019m doing, sure, as his lawyer\u201d \u2014 contradicting the suggestion that Mr. Trump was unaware. \u201cSondland\u2019s actions were based on Sondland\u2019s assumptions,\u201d Representative Mike Johnson of Louisiana, said last Wednesday on CNN. \u201cThere are many assumptions about a lot of what he said and that was based on his ideas about what was happening, not necessarily about what the president said.\u201d Mr. Sondland, in his revised testimony, did say that he \u201cpresumed that the aid suspension had become linked to the proposed anti-corruption statement.\u201d But he also noted that he believed the Ukrainian president needed to make a public pledge that he was beginning certain investigations before a White House visit would be granted \u2014 a condition, he said, that was communicated by Mr. Giuliani at Mr. Trump\u2019s direction. The most explicit example of this line of argument comes from Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky. \u201cMenendez tried it. Murphy tried it. Biden tried it. Trump\u2019s tried it. They\u2019re all doing it. They are all trying to manipulate Ukraine to get some kind of investigation, either to end an investigation or start an investigation,\u201d Mr. Paul said on Sunday on NBC. In May 2018, Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey and two other Democrats wrote a letter to Yuriy Lutsenko, then Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general, expressing concerns that Mr. Lutsenko\u2019s office had frozen investigations related to the special counsel investigation led by Robert S. Mueller III because officials were wary of offending Mr. Trump. The letter made no explicit mention of aid. Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, met with Mr. Zelensky in September as part of a bipartisan delegation. The Times reported that Mr. Murphy \u201csaid he urged Mr. Zelensky not to heed the requests from Mr. Giuliani, warning that to do so could threaten bipartisan support for Ukraine in Washington.\u201d Mr. Murphy later described his comments as a \u201ccommon sense\u201d caution against interfering in the 2020 election. As vice president, Mr. Biden had called for the dismissal of Viktor Shokin, who became prosecutor general of Ukraine in 2015, and Mr. Biden threatened to withhold assistance from the United States until Mr. Shokin was pushed out. But Mr. Biden\u2019s actions were in line with United States foreign policy as well as the stated positions of Senate Republicans, European Union leaders and the International Monetary Fund, all of whom were calling for Mr. Shokin\u2019s ouster. Some Republicans have not gone so far as to completely absolve Mr. Trump, but argue that his actions do not rise to the level of an impeachable offense. \u201cI believe that it is inappropriate for a president to ask a foreign leader to investigate a political rival,\u201d Representative Mac Thornberry of Texas said on Sunday. \u201cI do not believe it was impeachable.\u201d \u201cI think if you\u2019re trying to get information on a political rival to use in a political campaign is not something a president or any official should be doing,\u201d Representative Will Hurd of Texas said on Fox News Sunday. \u201cI believe that\u2019s something that would make it \u2014 have to truly consider whether impeachment is the right tool or not.\u201d",

      "author": "Michael D. Shear",
      "content": " Follow our live coverage of the Trump impeachment hearings. William B. Taylor Jr., the top United States diplomat in Ukraine, offered a new detail in his testimony to the House Intelligence Committee on Wednesday about how Mr. Trump\u2019s preoccupation with investigating the former vice president and his family had affected his actions toward Ukraine. Mr. Taylor said that a member of his staff overheard a telephone conversation in which the president mentioned \u201cthe investigations\u201d to Gordon D. Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union, who told him \u201cthat the Ukrainians were ready to move forward.\u201d After the call, the aide asked Mr. Sondland what the president thought of Ukraine, in Mr. Taylor\u2019s telling. The ambassador \u201cresponded that President Trump cares more about the investigations of Biden, which Giuliani was pressing for.\u201d He was referring to Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, whom Mr. Taylor described as the leader of an \u201chighly irregular\u201d policymaking channel on Ukraine that ran counter to goals of longstanding American policy. The episode was not included in Mr. Taylor\u2019s interview with impeachment investigators last month because, he said, he was not aware of it at the time. Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, quickly seized on it to put the president\u2019s concern with the investigations into context. \u201cI take it the import of that is he cares more about that than he does about Ukraine?\u201d Mr. Schiff asked. \u201cYes, sir,\u201d Mr. Taylor responded. Much of the rest of Mr. Taylor\u2019s testimony was consistent with what he told the panel previously, an account that included vivid details of how he discovered that Mr. Trump was conditioning \u201ceverything\u201d about the United States relationship with Ukraine \u2014 including needed military aid and a White House meeting for Ukraine\u2019s president \u2014 on the country\u2019s willingness to commit publicly to investigations of his political rivals. His testimony made it clear that the Ukrainians were well aware of the prerequisite at the time. The revelation came as Democrats opened the first public impeachment hearing in more than two decades, moving into the public\u2019s direct glare a historic clash between President Trump and Democrats that has so far unfolded in private. Mr. Taylor and George P. Kent, a senior State Department official who is also testifying, were seated next to each other at the witness table. Both men received subpoenas Wednesday morning to appear. Sign up here for the Impeachment Briefing newsletter, which explains the latest developments every weeknight. Mr. Kent testified that Mr. Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, conducted a smear campaign against the United States ambassador to Ukraine and led an effort to \u201cgin up politically motivated investigations,\u201d according to a copy of his opening statement In his opening statement, Mr. Kent said that he concluded by mid-August that Mr. Giuliani\u2019s efforts to pressure President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to open investigations into Mr. Trump\u2019s rivals \u201cwere now infecting U.S. engagement with Ukraine, leveraging President Zelensky\u2019s desire for a White House meeting.\u201d Mr. Kent also assailed what he called a \u201ccampaign to smear\u201d American officials serving in Ukraine, which succeeded with the ouster of Marie L. Yovanovitch, the former United States ambassador to Ukraine. \u201cIt was unexpected, and most unfortunate however, to watch some Americans \u2014 including those who allied themselves with corrupt Ukrainians in pursuit of private agendas \u2014 launch attacks on dedicated public servants advancing U.S. interests in Ukraine,\u201d Mr. Kent said in his opening statement. \u201cIn my opinion, those attacks undermined U.S. and Ukrainian national interests and damaged our critical bilateral relationship.\u201d When it was their turn to ask questions, Republicans on the Intelligence panel peppered the witnesses with rapid-fire questions, working to undercut their accounts as hearsay and supposition, and noting that neither had interacted directly with Mr. Trump. Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, a fiery inquisitor who was temporarily moved to the Intelligence Committee to play that role in the impeachment hearings, repeatedly challenged Mr. Taylor\u2019s version of events, which he dismissed as secondhand at best. After Mr. Taylor testified that military aid for Ukraine was withheld and conditioned on Ukraine launching the investigations that Mr. Trump wanted, Mr. Jordan jumped on him, noting that the military aid eventually was delivered. \u201cWhat you heard did not happen,\u201d Mr. Jordan said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just could it have been wrong, the fact is it was wrong, because it did not happen.\u201d The aid was released in September, after the White House had become aware that an intelligence whistle-blower had filed a complaint alleging that the freezing of the money had been part of a scheme by Mr. Trump to enlist Ukraine to help him in the 2020 election. Representative John Ratcliffe of Texas demanded that Mr. Taylor and Mr. Kent weigh in on whether the president should be impeached for what he said on the July 25 call with Mr. Zelensky. \u201cAre either of you here today to assert there was an impeachable offense in that call?\u201d Mr. Ratcliffe demanded. \u201cShout it out \u2014 anyone?\u201d Mr. Taylor reiterated a statement he had made earlier, saying he was not there to take sides, but to share what he knew. \u201cI\u2019m not here to do anything having to do with to decide about impeachment,\u201d the ambassador said. \u201cThat is not what either of us are here to do. This is your job.\u201d Mr. Schiff, the Intelligence Committee chairman, opened the hearing by summarizing the damning facts about President Trump\u2019s conduct that have been laid out privately by witnesses thus far, asking, \u201cIf this is not impeachable conduct, what is?\u201d He zeroed in on the public admission by Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, that Mr. Trump tied aid for the Ukrainians to their willingness to announce investigations into his political rivals. \u201cI have news for everybody: Get over it,\u201d Mr. Mulvaney said during a White House briefing last month, before later recanting. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be political influence in foreign policy. That is going to happen.\u201d Mr. Schiff described the statement as breathtaking, and cast the hearings now underway as a referendum on Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s assertion that Americans should accept Mr. Trump\u2019s actions as proper and befitting a president. \u201cIf he sought to condition, coerce, extort or bribe an ally into conducting investigations to aid his re-election campaign, and did so by withholding official acts \u2014 a White House meeting or hundreds of millions of dollars of needed military aid \u2014 must we simply \u2018get over it?\u2019\u201d Mr. Schiff asked. \u201cIs this what Americans should now expect from their president?\u201d Mr. Schiff said the questions at issue in the hearing on Wednesday are about whether Mr. Trump\u2019s abuses of power are compatible with the office of the presidency. \u201cThe matter is as simple, and as terrible as that,\u201d he said. The top Republican on the Intelligence panel accused the witnesses of working against Mr. Trump, casting previous testimony by diplomats and national security officials about the president\u2019s actions toward Ukraine as nothing more than unfounded, second- or thirdhand allegations from members of a \u201cpoliticized bureaucracy.\u201d Representative Devin Nunes, Republican of California, opened his party\u2019s defense of the president by charging that the allegations were coming from a group of civil servants who \u201chave decided that they, not the president, are really in charge.\u201d Facing the two veteran diplomats at the witness table, Mr. Nunes said they had been convinced, \u201cwittingly or unwittingly,\u201d to be part of a corrupt investigation that he called a \u201ctelevised theatrical performance, staged by the Democrats.\u201d \u201cThe main performance, the Russia hoax, has ended, and you\u2019ve been cast in the low-rent Ukrainian sequel,\u201d Mr. Nunes said. He said diplomats in the State Department had worked to undercut the president, and in the process had \u201clost the confidence of millions of Americans who believe that their vote should count for something.\u201d Republicans sought to defend Mr. Trump at Wednesday\u2019s impeachment hearings by repeatedly raising unproven theories about Mr. Biden\u2019s son and allegations that Ukraine conspired with Democrats to interfere in the 2016 election on behalf of the president\u2019s rival. \u201cThey accuse President Trump of malfeasance in Ukraine when they, themselves, are culpable,\u201d Mr. Nunes, the top Republican on the Intelligence Committee, said of Democrats in his opening statement. \u201cThe Democrats cooperated in Ukrainian election meddling and they defend Hunter Biden\u2019s securing of a lavishly paid position with a corrupt Ukrainian company.\u201d His allegations were part of the Republican strategy to defend Mr. Trump by attempting to shift the conversation away from the mountain of evidence that Democrats have assembled about the president\u2019s conduct, and instead focus on his grudges. Democrats have so far refused requests for witnesses who Republicans claim would bolster their theories, including Hunter Biden, but Republican lawmakers did not let that stop them from pressing Mr. Taylor and Mr. Kent to back them up. Both of them largely declined, saying they knew little about any allegation of corruption involving Hunter Biden\u2019s service on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company. Asked by a Republican lawyer about Mr. Biden\u2019s qualifications to serve on the company\u2019s board, Mr. Kent demurred. \u201cI have no idea what Hunter Biden studied at university or what his C.V. says,\u201d Mr. Kent responded. \u201cI have no awareness or knowledge of what his background was.\u201d Mr. Trump fired off several tweets about the impeachment hearing as it got underway Wednesday even as his press secretary said Mr. Trump was not watching the drama play out on Capitol Hill. \u201cHe\u2019s in the Oval in meetings,\u201d Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary, told reporters about an hour after the hearing was gaveled open. \u201cNot watching. He\u2019s working.\u201d Moments after Ms. Grisham said that, Mr. Trump retweeted several posts from House Republicans attacking the hearings. Earlier, the president tweeted: \u201cNew Hoax. Same swamp\u201d shortly before the hearings opened. As the hearings unfolded, Mr. Trump was scheduled to host President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey at the White House for a daylong visit. Mr. Trump is scheduled to hold a joint news conference with Mr. Erdogan at about 3 p.m. Mr. Trump has repeatedly shown his willingness to use such appearances with foreign leaders to engage directly with reporters, especially at moments when his administration is engulfed in controversy. The news conference with Mr. Erdogan could provide him with an opportunity to rail against the impeachment hearings, setting up the possibility of a compelling split-screen moment from both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue.",

      "author": "Carl Hulse",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 After hours of testimony in the first impeachment hearing in decades, William B. Taylor Jr. on Wednesday afternoon finally got down to the heart of the issue dividing Congress over President Trump\u2019s conduct. \u201cHolding up of security assistance that would go to a country that is fighting aggression from Russia for no good policy reason, no good substantive reason, no good national security reason is wrong,\u201d Mr. Taylor, the unflappable acting ambassador to Ukraine, said in a commanding voice somehow reminiscent of Walter Cronkite. Wrong perhaps, but was it sufficiently wrong to justify removing a duly elected president from office? And more to the point, is it enough to persuade Republicans \u2014 so far monolithic in their support for Mr. Trump \u2014 to break from him over whether he withheld military aid to Ukraine as leverage for investigations into a political rival? For now, the answer appears to be no. \u201cIt all starts to fall apart when you start tracking it back to who actually knew what when,\u201d said Representative Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina and one of the president\u2019s fiercest defenders. His sentiment was emblematic of the Republican view. Despite no sign of cracks in the Republican wall, the view on Capitol Hill was that Democrats mounted a strong performance in their first public impeachment hearing, much more effective than their questioning in July of Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel who investigated Russian interference. That session \u2014 featuring a reluctant witness who appeared determined to avoid any dramatic depiction of his damning findings \u2014 was largely considered a flop. It led Democrats to all but drop their talk of impeachment until a whistle-blower emerged accusing Mr. Trump of abusing his power to enlist Ukraine\u2019s help in discrediting former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his younger son, Hunter. Democrats showed they learned from their previous experience. They staged the hearing differently, allowing committee lawyers to conduct some of the questioning, a move that cut down on the showboating by lawmakers and gave their respective counsels the opportunity to pursue substantive lines of questioning. Mr. Taylor, like Mr. Mueller a Vietnam combat veteran and career public servant, came across as the anti-Mueller, confidently marshaling his facts from memory and readily offering his observations. In poised testimony, he matter-of-factly laid out how he came to discover that an \u201cirregular channel\u201d \u2014 certain to become a Washington buzzword \u2014 was working against a regular diplomatic channel enforcing the official American policy of backing Ukraine in its efforts to hold off Russian aggression. Mr. Taylor said he \u201csat in astonishment\u201d as he learned via conference call that the White House Office of Management and Budget had put a hold on nearly $400 million in military assistance for Ukraine. He disclosed new information about an aide who overheard a phone call between Mr. Trump and Gordon D. Sondland, a Trump ally who is the United States ambassador to the European Union, in which the president pressed for news about Ukrainian investigations into the Bidens. Mr. Taylor was able to elevate the investigation above political sniping into a higher realm, one about a life-or-death struggle not just for Ukraine, but also for the United States. While Mr. Trump\u2019s administration withheld the aid, he said, Ukrainians were dying weekly in their conflict with Russian-backed forces, with Moscow ready to pounce on the slightest sign that the United States was pulling away from Ukraine. It was not just about Ukraine\u2019s security, he said, it was about America\u2019s as well. \u201cThat security was so important for Ukraine as well as our own national interests, to withhold that assistance for no good reason other than help with a political campaign made no sense,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was counterproductive to all of what we had been trying to do. It was illogical. It could not be explained. It was crazy.\u201d As for Republican claims that Mr. Biden had operated corruptly in Ukraine, the day\u2019s other witness, the impressively bow-tied George Kent, the deputy assistant secretary of state and an expert in corruption, said there was no foundation \u201cwhatsoever\u201d to those accusations. Republicans offered an array of defenses, repeatedly challenging the two witnesses on the grounds that they had no direct knowledge of what the president\u2019s orders or ideas were. They said the president was only acting prudently to protect American taxpayer interests by urging investigations into corruption in a nation with a history of self-dealing by top officials before committing American aid. Mr. Trump\u2019s allies said the military support was eventually approved, so no offense was committed. They ridiculed the idea that Mr. Taylor, the \u201cstar witness\u201d for Democrats, had never even met the president, and dismissed his account and those of other witnesses as hearsay. And Republicans insisted that Democrats were seeking a do-over after the Mueller report failed to deliver a knockout blow to the president. They suggested Democrats had fired at the president and missed. Rather than get into a nasty committee brawl with Democrats that could transfix a television audience, Republicans chose to try to keep the proceedings relatively sedate. They expect that public interest will dissipate after an opening day that Republicans rated as boring and confusing to Americans who have not closely followed developments. Democrats don\u2019t see it that way. They believe they were successful in creating the framework for drafting articles of impeachment against the president, relying on the opening testimony of two nonpartisan career officials who insisted they were not taking sides in the fight but reporting only what they saw and heard. They anticipate more fireworks to come. Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, predicted from the start that Republicans would not be able to challenge the underlying evidence. \u201cWe don\u2019t expect the facts are going to be largely contested,\u201d he said. That suggests that the entire process will turn on the interpretation of those facts. On that score, Republicans and Democrats remain bitterly divided. Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, affirmed again Wednesday that he expected the Senate to conduct a full trial of whatever articles of impeachment emerge from the House. But he also suggested that Republicans had not seen enough to even consider ousting the president. \u201cMy own view is that we should give people an opportunity to put the case on,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201cThe House will have presenters. The president will, no doubt, be represented by lawyers as well. On the issue of how long it goes on, it\u2019s really kind of up to the Senate. People will have to conclude are they learning something new? At some point, we\u2019ll get to an end.\u201d Republicans continue to insist they know what that end is: acquittal of the president by the Senate. Democrats are determined to change that narrative, but they are not there yet.",

      "author": "Nicholas Fandos",
      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 The House of Representatives opened historic impeachment hearings on Wednesday and took startling new testimony from a senior American diplomat that further implicated President Trump in a campaign to pressure Ukraine to publicly commit to investigating former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. In a nationally televised hearing from a stately committee room across from the Capitol, William B. Taylor Jr., the top American diplomat in Ukraine, brought to life Democrats\u2019 allegations that Mr. Trump had abused his office by trying to enlist a foreign power to help him in an election. Mr. Taylor testified to the House Intelligence Committee that he learned only recently of a July telephone call overheard by one of his aides in which the president was preoccupied with Ukraine\u2019s willingness to say it would look into Mr. Biden and work by his son Hunter Biden for a Ukrainian energy firm. Immediately afterward, Mr. Taylor said, the aide had been informed that Mr. Trump cared more about \u201cinvestigations of Biden\u201d than he did about Ukraine. A powerful witness for Democrats, Mr. Taylor appeared as Congress embarked on the third set of presidential impeachment hearings in modern times. Forceful, detailed and unflappable in the face of Republican taunts, the veteran diplomat delivered a remarkable rebuke of the actions taken by the president and his allies inside and outside of the government who placed Mr. Trump\u2019s political objectives at the center of American policy toward Ukraine. \u201cSecurity was so important for Ukraine, as well as our own national interests,\u201d Mr. Taylor testified, describing his growing sense of alarm at learning that $391 million in vital military aid for the former Soviet republic had been held up. \u201cTo withhold that assistance for no good reason other than help with a political campaign made no sense. It was counterproductive to all of what we had been trying to do. It was illogical. It could not be explained. It was crazy.\u201d The proceedings pushed into the public gaze an epic impeachment clash between Mr. Trump, his Republican allies and Democrats that has shifted into high gear less than a year before the presidential election. In the first impeachment hearing in more than two decades, Mr. Taylor and another seasoned diplomat, George P. Kent, sketched out, in testimony by turns cinematic and dry, a tale of foreign policymaking distorted by a president\u2019s political vendettas with a small country facing Russian aggression caught in the middle. Democrats toiled to make their case to a deeply divided nation that Mr. Trump had put the integrity of the 2020 election at risk by withholding the security assistance for Ukraine\u2019s war with Russia to try to extract a political advantage for his re-election campaign. \u201cIf this is not impeachable conduct,\u201d demanded Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the chairman of the committee, \u201cwhat is?\u201d Showing no sign of doubts, Mr. Trump\u2019s Republican defenders raged against a process they called unfair and illegitimate. They dismissed Mr. Taylor and Mr. Kent \u2014 who between them have 70 years of experience as public servants under presidents of both parties \u2014 as part of a \u201cpoliticized bureaucracy\u201d who were offering nothing more than hearsay and supposition, rather than evidence of impeachable conduct. \u201cThe American people see through all this,\u201d said Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio. \u201cThey understand the facts support the president. They understand this process is unfair. And they see through the whole darn sham.\u201d At the White House on Wednesday, Mr. Trump sought to project an air of confidence in the face of an existential threat to his presidency. Before a working meeting with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, Mr. Trump told reporters of the hearing: \u201cIt\u2019s a hoax. I\u2019m too busy to watch it.\u201d But even so, Mr. Trump was busy all day retweeting allies defending him. His re-election campaign blasted out a fund-raising solicitation accusing Democrats of \u201cplaying a sick game.\u201d And the Republican National Committee circulated memes making fun of the witnesses as gossips who lacked firsthand information. Asked for his reaction after the hearing ended, Mr. Trump said he had heard \u201cit is a joke\u201d and insisted that he had not watched it \u201cfor one minute.\u201d He called the impeachment effort a sham and said, \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be allowed.\u201d Even as the public recitation of facts unfolded in the hearing room, there were signs that Democrats\u2019 investigation was still expanding. Investigators scheduled depositions with David Holmes, an official in the United States Embassy in Kiev, and Mark Sandy, of the Office of Management and Budget, for Friday and Saturday. According to an official involved in the inquiry, Mr. Holmes was the aide Mr. Taylor referred to in his new testimony, who told Mr. Taylor about Mr. Trump\u2019s singular interest in investigating the Bidens. Mr. Taylor said a member of his staff overheard a telephone conversation in which the president mentioned \u201cthe investigations\u201d to Gordon D. Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union, who then told Mr. Trump \u201cthat the Ukrainians were ready to move forward.\u201d The conversation took place in a restaurant in Kiev one day after the July 25 phone call in which Mr. Trump personally pressed President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to investigate the Bidens and unproven allegations that Ukraine conspired with Democrats to interfere in the 2016 election. When Mr. Holmes inquired after the call what the president thought about Ukraine, Mr. Sondland \u201cresponded that President Trump cares more about the investigations of Biden, which Giuliani was pressing for,\u201d in Mr. Taylor\u2019s telling. Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, led what Mr. Taylor called a \u201chighly irregular\u201d policymaking channel on Ukraine that ran counter to goals of longstanding American policy. The episode was not included in Mr. Taylor\u2019s interview with investigators last month because he was not aware of it at the time. But the new disclosure promises to figure prominently when Mr. Sondland appears next week for his own public testimony. Asked Wednesday afternoon about the call, Mr. Trump said, \u201cI know nothing about that.\u201d Standing beside Mr. Erdogan during a joint news conference at the White House, Mr. Trump pledged to release on Thursday a reconstructed transcript of another phone conversation he had with Mr. Zelensky, that one in April, additional evidence that the White House hopes can distract from the Democrats\u2019 case. The revelation came as Mr. Taylor recounted publicly what he had already told investigators privately. He said he had discovered that Mr. Trump was conditioning \u201ceverything\u201d about the United States\u2019 relationship with Ukraine \u2014 including needed military aid and a White House meeting for Ukraine\u2019s president \u2014 on the country\u2019s willingness to commit publicly to investigations of his political rivals. Mr. Taylor\u2019s testimony made it clear that the Ukrainians were well aware of the prerequisite at the time. Asked by a Democratic lawyer if he had ever seen \u201canother example of foreign aid conditioned on the personal or political interests of the president of the United States,\u201d Mr. Taylor, in a sonorous voice that echoed through the hearing room, said, \u201cI have not.\u201d In his opening statement, Mr. Kent said he had concluded by mid-August that Mr. Giuliani\u2019s efforts to pressure Mr. Zelensky to open investigations into Mr. Trump\u2019s rivals \u201cwere now infecting U.S. engagement with Ukraine, leveraging President Zelensky\u2019s desire for a White House meeting.\u201d Mr. Kent also assailed what he called a \u201ccampaign to smear\u201d American officials serving in Ukraine, which succeeded with the ouster of Marie L. Yovanovitch, the former United States ambassador there. \u201cIn my opinion, those attacks undermined U.S. and Ukrainian national interests and damaged our critical bilateral relationship,\u201d Mr. Kent said in his opening statement. Both witnesses forcefully rejected attempts by Republicans and Democrats to draw them into a partisan drama over the impeachment inquiry, declaring they are not \u201cNever Trumpers.\u201d Responding to Mr. Jordan\u2019s assertion that he was the star witness for the Democrats, Mr. Taylor insisted that he was not a political pawn of either party. \u201cI don\u2019t consider myself a star witness for anything,\u201d he said. \u201cI think I was clear I\u2019m not here to take one side or the other.\u201d And Mr. Taylor refused to take a position on whether Mr. Trump\u2019s actions were impeachable, telling Representative John Ratcliffe, Republican of Texas: \u201cThat is not what either of us are here for. This is your job.\u201d Even so, with the help of another nine public witnesses over the coming 10 days, Democrats hope to lay out a case that will capture the public\u2019s attention and convince a majority of Americans that Mr. Trump\u2019s actions are worthy of the Constitution\u2019s gravest reprimand: possible removal from office. \u201cI don\u2019t think President Trump was trying to end corruption in Ukraine,\u201d said Representative Jim Himes, Democrat of Connecticut. \u201cI think he was trying to aim corruption in Ukraine at Vice President Biden and at the 2020 election.\u201d Determined to seize what is plainly their best chance to capture the attention of the American public, Mr. Schiff, the committee\u2019s chairman, laid out the stakes. He invoked the words of Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, who defiantly told reporters to \u201cget over it\u201d when questioned about conditioning military aid to Ukraine to investigations Mr. Trump wanted. \u201cIf he sought to condition, coerce, extort or bribe an ally into conducting investigations to aid his re-election campaign, and did so by withholding official acts \u2014 a White House meeting or hundreds of millions of dollars of needed military aid \u2014 must we simply \u2018get over it\u2019?\u201d Mr. Schiff asked. \u201cIs this what Americans should now expect from their president?\u201d Mr. Schiff gaveled in Wednesday\u2019s hearing exactly 50 days after Speaker Nancy Pelosi opened the impeachment inquiry. The public hearings are a turning point for House Democrats from which they are unlikely to turn back. The Ukraine inquiry, after months of pursuit of Mr. Trump and years of Democratic agony over his flouting of political norms, now appears to have too much momentum to be turned back short of impeachment, even if it means muscling through a partisan vote akin to Republicans\u2019 impeachment of President Bill Clinton in 1998. Whether the inquiry has any chance of penetrating the intense partisan polarization that has gripped the country in recent years remains the central question for Democrats and Mr. Trump. Public polling suggests a slight majority of the country supports the inquiry, but Democratic leaders privately concede that given Mr. Trump\u2019s fervent base of support, almost no scenario could tip the country more decisively against him. Republicans cannot stop Democrats from impeaching Mr. Trump, but they are determined to ensure that any vote to do so is partisan. Their strategy is multipronged. It includes defending Mr. Trump\u2019s interest in Ukrainian corruption as legitimate, and portraying Democrats as desperate to find something, anything, to take out Mr. Trump. \u201cThe main performance, the Russia hoax, has ended, and you\u2019ve been cast in the low-rent Ukrainian sequel,\u201d said Representative Devin Nunes of California, the Intelligence Committee\u2019s top Republican, said Wednesday in an opening statement. He spoke of a \u201cpoliticized bureaucracy\u201d working against Mr. Trump, saying that diplomats in the State Department had worked to undercut the president. In the process, Mr. Nunes said, they had \u201clost the confidence of millions of Americans who believe that their vote should count for something.\u201d",

      "author": "Lisa Lerer",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Former President Barack Obama offered an unusual warning to the Democratic primary field on Friday evening, cautioning the candidates not to move too far to the left in their policy proposals, even as he sought to reassure a party establishment worried about the electoral strength of their historically large primary field. Speaking before a room of wealthy liberal donors, Mr. Obama urged Democrats to remember the long, combative slog of his primary campaign against Hillary Clinton in 2008, arguing that the 16 month battle ultimately made him a stronger general election candidate. \u201cFor those who get stressed about robust primaries, I just have to remind you I had a very robust primary,\u201d he told the group of several hundred donors and organizational leaders in Washington. \u201cI\u2019m confident that at the end of the process we will have a candidate that has been tested.\u201d Yet, he also raised concerns about some of the liberal ideas being promoted by some candidates, citing health care and immigration as issues where the proposals may have gone further than public opinion. While Mr. Obama did not single out any specific primary candidate or policy proposal, he cautioned that the universe of voters that could support a Democratic candidate \u2014 Democrats, independents and moderate Republicans \u2014 are not driven by the same views reflected on \u201ccertain left-leaning Twitter feeds\u201d or \u201cthe activist wing of our party.\u201d \u201cEven as we push the envelope and we are bold in our vision we also have to be rooted in reality,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cThe average American doesn\u2019t think we have to completely tear down the system and remake it.\u201d The comments marked an extraordinary entrance into the primary contest by the former president, who has been careful to avoid even the appearance of influencing the direction of the race. His remarks offered an implicit critique of Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, who have urged voters to embrace \u201cpolitical revolution\u201d and \u201cbig, structural change,\u201d as well as proposals once widely considered to be left to the liberal fringes of the party, including court packing and decriminalizing illegal border crossings. Even as Mr. Obama has attempted to stay out of the race, the primary candidates have engaged in a heated discussion over his legacy, debating whether to stick with Mr. Obama\u2019s architecture for health care policy or to pursue a single-payer system and offering flashes of direct criticism over his record on immigration. At the same time, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has made his strong support for Mr. Obama and his accomplishments a hallmark of his candidacy. Acknowledging that candidates must \u201cpush past\u201d his achievements, Mr. Obama urged his party\u2019s candidates not to push too far, as he urged them to adopt a message that would allow them to compete in all corners of the country. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should be deluded into thinking that the resistance to certain approaches to things is simply because voters haven\u2019t heard a bold enough proposal and if they hear something as bold as possible then immediately that\u2019s going to activate them,\u201d he said. The fact that Mr. Obama offered his reassurances at the annual meeting of the Democracy Alliance, a club of wealthy liberals who donate hundreds of thousands of dollars a year to recommended political organizations, only underscored the intended audience of his message. In recent weeks, establishment-aligned Democrats, top donors and some strategists have expressed fears that the party lacks a strong enough candidate to defeat President Trump. They question whether Mr. Biden has the ability to compete in a multistate primary campaign, fret about Mr. Sanders\u2019s and Ms. Warren\u2019s viability in the general election and remain skeptical that Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., can broaden his appeal beyond white voters. Their concerns have prompted the late emergence of two experienced candidates, Deval Patrick, the former governor of Massachusetts and a close friend of Mr. Obama, and Michael R. Bloomberg, both of whom entered the field after nine candidates had already dropped out. Those worries are not necessarily shared by voters in early states, where surveys show that most Democrats have gravitated to a short list of four candidates and feel the field remains too large. \u201cIf you talk to the voters they don\u2019t feel the need for another candidate,\u201d said Kathy Sullivan, the former chairwoman of the Democratic Party in New Hampshire. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been sitting around in New Hampshire saying we need a hero to come and rescue us.\u201d Since leaving office nearly three years ago, the former president has mostly remained out of the public fray. While he\u2019s headlined fund-raising events for Democratic committees, the former president has kept a low profile in the presidential race, meeting privately with most of the Democratic candidates but telling friends and political allies that neither he nor his wife, Michelle, have plans to endorse anyone and do not see it as their place to steer the party\u2019s future. Mr. Obama has expressed interest, at different times, in rising stars like former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas and Mr. Buttigieg. Mr. Obama had issued a warm statement about Mr. Biden\u2019s entry into the primary but had declined to endorse him or anyone else. During his nearly hourlong remarks on Friday, Mr. Obama offered only one clear endorsement, though not exactly the one many Democratic donors in the room wanted to hear. Mr. Obama was interviewed by Stacey Abrams, who drew national attention during her unsuccessful run for governor of Georgia last year and is widely considered to be on the shortlist for the vice presidency \u2014 no matter which candidate ultimately wins the nomination. \u201cI love me some Stacey Abrams,\u201d he said.",

      "author": "Nicholas Fandos",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 An official from the United States Embassy in Kiev confirmed to House impeachment investigators on Friday that he had overheard a call between President Trump and a top American diplomat in July in which the president asked whether Ukraine was going to move forward with an investigation he wanted. The official, David Holmes, testified privately that he was at a restaurant in Kiev, Ukraine\u2019s capital, when he overheard Mr. Trump on a cellphone call loudly asking Gordon D. Sondland, the American ambassador to the European Union, if Ukraine\u2019s president had agreed to conduct an investigation into one of his leading political rivals. Mr. Sondland, who had just come from a meeting with top Ukrainian officials and the country\u2019s president, replied in the affirmative. \u201cSo, he\u2019s going to do the investigation?\u201d Mr. Trump asked, according to a copy of Mr. Holmes\u2019s opening statement posted by CNN and confirmed by The New York Times. Mr. Sondland, a wealthy hotelier and political donor turned ambassador, told Mr. Trump that President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine \u201cloves your ass,\u201d and would conduct the investigation and do \u201canything you ask him to,\u201d according to Mr. Holmes\u2019s statement. After the call ended, Mr. Holmes asked if it was true that the president did not care about Ukraine. Mr. Sondland, he testified, agreed. According to Mr. Holmes\u2019s account, the ambassador said Mr. Trump cared only about the \u201cbig stuff.\u201d Mr. Holmes noted Ukraine had \u201cbig stuff\u201d going on, like a war with Russia. But Mr. Sondland had something else in mind. He told Mr. Holmes he meant \u201c\u2018big stuff\u2019 that benefits the president,\u201d like the \u201cBiden investigation\u201d that his lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani was pushing for, because it affected him personally. The account could prove significant as Democrats continue to build an impeachment case against Mr. Trump. It illustrates how preoccupied he was with persuading Ukraine\u2019s president to go along with his demand that the country commit publicly to investigating former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., a leading political rival, and how he actively used his power and the instruments of American foreign policy to see that it happened. It adds significant new detail to a conversation that was first revealed on Wednesday during public testimony by Mr. Holmes\u2019s boss, William B. Taylor Jr., the top American envoy in Ukraine. Mr. Taylor said then that he had only recently learned of the episode from Mr. Holmes. And it raised the possibility that Mr. Holmes could be called to testify publicly in the impeachment inquiry and presented Democrats with new leads to track down even as they conduct a string of high-profile public hearings with other witnesses. Mr. Holmes, a career Foreign Service officer who is the political counselor in the American Embassy in Kiev, said he had been following the impeachment inquiry from afar in recent weeks and came to understand only belatedly that he had pertinent information to share. He testified under subpoena by the House Intelligence Committee after the State Department directed him not to appear, according to an official working on the inquiry. \u201cI came to realize I had firsthand knowledge regarding certain events on July 26 that had not otherwise been reported, and that those events potentially bore on the question of whether the president did, in fact, have knowledge that those officials were using the levers of our diplomatic power to induce the new Ukrainian president to announce the opening of a particular criminal investigation,\u201d he testified. Mr. Holmes\u2019s account of the relationship between the two countries in his opening statement was broader, though, and closely resembles that offered by other top officials who have offered public and private testimony to the House. He described how Mr. Sondland and two other American officials \u2014 Energy Secretary Rick Perry and Kurt D. Volker, the United States special envoy to Ukraine \u2014 styled themselves as the \u201cThree Amigos\u201d and took charge of Ukraine policy within the administration. On the outside, Mr. Giuliani exercised significant influence over what they did. \u201cBeginning in March 2019, the situation in the embassy and in Ukraine changed dramatically,\u201d Mr. Holmes said, according to his statement. \u201cSpecifically, our diplomatic policy that had been focused on supporting Ukrainian democratic reform and resistance to Russian aggression became overshadowed by a political agenda being promoted by Rudy Giuliani and a cadre of officials operating with a direct channel to the White House.\u201d The conversation between Mr. Trump and Mr. Sondland took place on July 26, one day after Mr. Trump personally pressed Mr. Zelensky in a now-famous phone call to investigate Mr. Biden and his son Hunter Biden, as well as unproven allegations that Ukraine conspired with Democrats to interfere in the 2016 election. Mr. Trump specifically wanted an investigation into unsubstantiated corruption allegations related to Hunter Biden\u2019s work for a Ukrainian energy firm, Burisma Holdings. Mr. Sondland did not mention the episode to investigators last month when he answered their questions in private. He will almost certainly be asked about it next week when he appears for public testimony before the House Intelligence Committee. He has already revised his initial testimony once, admitting to the panel last week that he told a top Ukrainian official that the country would probably not receive a package of nearly $400 million in security assistance Mr. Trump froze in July unless it committed publicly to the investigations Mr. Trump sought. And Republicans have argued that he may be overstating his access to and influence with the president. On Thursday, two people familiar with the matter said that a second embassy official, Suriya Jayanti, also overheard the call and could corroborate Mr. Holmes\u2019s account. It is unclear if investigators will also call her to testify. On Friday, Mr. Holmes indicated there was a third person present who would have overheard it, as well. Mr. Holmes told investigators that he did not take notes during the conversation, but said he immediately told other embassy officials about it. The conversation took place not long after Mr. Sondland had met directly with Mr. Zelensky and other officials. Mr. Holmes\u2019s account gave hints that Mr. Trump\u2019s request may have been on Mr. Zelensky\u2019s mind, but it does not indicate what, if anything, he or his aides may have communicated to Mr. Sondland. In the meeting, Mr. Holmes recalled, Mr. Zelensky said that Mr. Trump had raised \u201csome very sensitive issues\u201d \u201cthree times\u201d on the call \u2014 issues the Ukrainian leader noted they would have to follow up on in person. Mr. Holmes described sitting on the terrace of a Kiev restaurant a little while later during lunch with Mr. Sondland, sharing a bottle of wine, when Mr. Sondland called Mr. Trump. The president was speaking so loudly, he said, that Mr. Sondland held the phone away from his ear and Mr. Holmes and others could hear Mr. Trump\u2019s voice. In addition to discussing the investigations, Mr. Trump and Mr. Sondland discussed ASAP Rocky, an American rapper imprisoned in Sweden at the time on charges of assault. Mr. Sondland told the president the rapper \u201cshould have pled guilty,\u201d according to Mr. Holmes\u2019s written statement. Mr. Sondland then advised Mr. Trump that he should \u201clet him get sentenced, play the racism card, give him a ticker-tape when he comes home,\u201d Mr. Holmes testified. The ambassador added that Sweden \u201cshould have released him on your word,\u201d and added, referring to an American reality show celebrity family pressing for Mr. Trump\u2019s help in the case, \u201cyou can tell the Kardashians you tried.\u201d Mr. Sondland noted after the call that the president was in a \u201cbad mood.\u201d Mr. Holmes\u2019s account included other potentially significant details new to investigators about Trump administration officials using a White House meeting and the frozen military assistance as leverage for what Mr. Trump wanted. He testified that Mr. Taylor told him at the time about a June 28 call with him, the \u201cThree Amigos\u201d and Mr. Zelensky in which \u201cit was made clear that some action on a Burisma/Biden investigation was a precondition for an Oval Office meeting.\u201d Mr. Taylor described the same call in his testimony, saying that Mr. Sondland had said he \u201cwanted to make sure no one was transcribing or monitoring\u201d the call. But Mr. Taylor did not say that investigations or preconditions had been discussed. \u201cIt is important to understand that a White House visit was critical to President Zelensky,\u201d Mr. Holmes said. \u201cHe needed to demonstrate U.S. support at the highest levels both to advance his ambitious anti-corruption agenda at home and to encourage Russian President Putin to take seriously President Zelensky\u2019s peace efforts.\u201d By late summer, Mr. Holmes testified, he had a \u201cclear impression\u201d that a hold on the military aid was also \u201clikely intended by the president either to express dissatisfaction that the Ukrainians had not yet agreed to the Burisma/Biden investigations or as an effort to increase the pressure on them to do so.\u201d Mr. Holmes also described frustrations among American officials. At one point, he said, Mr. Sondland vented: \u201cDammit, Rudy. Every time Rudy gets involved he goes and f\u2014s everything up.\u201d He said that John R. Bolton, the president\u2019s former national security adviser, openly discussed strategies for marginalizing Mr. Giuliani on a trip to Kiev during the summer. Mr. Holmes testified that he also complained about Mr. Sondland\u2019s \u201cexpansive interpretation of his mandate.\u201d And he recalled Mr. Bolton saying that a hold on the security assistance would be lifted only if Mr. Zelensky could \u201cfavorably impress\u201d during a face-to-face meeting scheduled for early September. The meeting never happened. Other witnesses have described similar concerns by Mr. Bolton, and investigators would like to speak with him, but he has declined to appear given White House orders not to.",

      "content": " DES MOINES \u2014 Pete Buttigieg continues to surge in Iowa, leapfrogging Senator Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. to hold a commanding lead among likely Democratic caucusgoers, according to a new poll from The Des Moines Register and CNN. The poll showed that Mr. Buttigieg, the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Ind., was the first choice for 25 percent of would-be Democratic caucusgoers, a significant increase from the 9 percent he held in September, when The Register last polled the state. The support placed him far ahead of the rest of the field \u2014 with the other three top candidates in a virtual tie for second: Ms. Warren at 16 percent and Mr. Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders at 15 percent. The results are the latest evidence of Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s strength in Iowa, where his moderate political views, plain-spoken style and military history have resonated in the early voting state. Since September, when he placed fourth in the Register poll, he has more than doubled his on-the-ground staff to over 100 and has opened more than 20 field offices. He recently completed another bus tour in the state. Speaking to reporters in Long Beach, Calif., on Saturday night during the state\u2019s Democratic convention, Mr. Buttigieg said the just-released poll numbers were \u201cextremely encouraging.\u201d \u201cWe have felt a lot of momentum on the ground,\u201d he said. His rise also suggests that voters, in Iowa at least, are increasingly favoring a centrist agenda \u2014 a view that has drawn two new entrants, Deval Patrick, the former governor of Massachusetts, and Michael R. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City, into the race this month. The poll results reflect the deep split within the Democratic Party over whether it is veering too far to the left to defeat President Trump. Speaking on Friday to a room of wealthy liberal donors, former President Barack Obama expressed concern about some of the policy ideas being promoted by some of the candidates, citing health care and immigration as issues where the proposals may not align with public opinion. Though he did not single out any candidates directly, his remarks were seen as an implicit criticism of Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren, two of the leading candidates who are pushing policy plans once considered too liberal, like \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d with the broader goal of \u201cpolitical revolution\u201d and \u201cbig, structural change.\u201d \u201cEven as we push the envelope and we are bold in our vision we also have to be rooted in reality,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cThe average American doesn\u2019t think we have to completely tear down the system and remake it.\u201d Ms. Warren, who led the Register\u2019s September poll, with 22 percent, fell 6 percentage points. Her poll numbers are now roughly what they were in June, when she was at 15 percent. Mr. Sanders, who suffered a heart attack shortly after the last poll results were released, climbed 4 percentage points. Mr. Biden, who has seen his standing in Iowa slowly slip, dropped 5 percentage points. In addition to identifying a new Iowa front-runner, the poll has once again delineated a clear divide between the top tier of Democratic candidates \u2014 Mr. Buttigieg, Ms. Warren, Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders \u2014 and the rest of the field. The next-closest candidate in the poll was Senator Amy Klobuchar, with 6 percent, followed by a cluster of White House hopefuls with 3 percent, including Senator Cory Booker, Senator Kamala Harris and Andrew Yang. Mr. Bloomberg, who has suggested he would skip the first four early nominating states, including Iowa, if he were to officially enter the race, was at 2 percent.",

      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 Two White House national security officials testified before the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry on Tuesday that President Trump\u2019s request to Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate Democratic rivals was inappropriate, and one of them said it validated his \u201cworst fear\u201d that American policy toward that country would veer off course. Hours later, two more witnesses \u2014 another former White House national security official and a former top American diplomat\u00a0\u2014 charted a more careful course but said under oath that the president\u2019s requests on a July 25 phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine were not in line with American national security goals. The new accounts came as the House Intelligence Committee opened a packed week of testimony, with nine witnesses scheduled to answer questions in public before the House leaves for Thanksgiving. Democrats used Tuesday\u2019s back-to-back hearings to move the focus of their growing case to the White House and back to the July phone call they see as the centerpiece of an abuse of power by Mr. Trump. They say he used his office to try to obtain a political advantage from a foreign power. Taking their cues from the White House, Republicans moved aggressively to try to undercut the day\u2019s lead witness, Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman, the National Security Council\u2019s Ukraine expert. They tried to raise questions about Colonel Vindman\u2019s loyalty to the United States, and sought to portray the concerns expressed by Colonel Vindman and an aide to Vice President Mike Pence as merely the opinions of unelected, and even unreliable, bureaucrats second-guessing the president of the United States. Colonel Vindman responded by invoking his sense of duty as an American and an officer to explain why he was so alarmed by Mr. Trump\u2019s request that he reported his concerns to White House lawyers. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe what I was hearing,\u201d said Colonel Vindman, an Iraq war combat veteran who testified in his deep-blue Army dress uniform covered with military ribbons. \u201cIt was probably an element of shock \u2014 that maybe, in certain regards, my worst fear of how our Ukraine policy could play out was playing out, and how this was likely to have significant implications for U.S. national security.\u201d Sitting beside him during the morning\u2019s hearing, Jennifer Williams, a diplomat serving on Mr. Pence\u2019s national security staff, reiterated that she found Mr. Trump\u2019s phone call with Mr. Zelensky \u201cunusual and inappropriate.\u201d She said she was struck that Mr. Trump was pressing a foreign leader about a personal domestic political issue, though she did not report any concerns at the time and spoke in more reserved terms. On the call, Mr. Trump veered off talking points prepared by Colonel Vindman and pressed Mr. Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son Hunter Biden and a debunked theory that Democrats conspired with Ukraine to interfere in the 2016 election. Both witnesses testified that as the summer went on, concerns within the American and Ukrainian governments grew over Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to withhold vital military assistance for the country \u2014 a step he took as he pressed for the investigations. National security officials in the United States unanimously supported releasing the aid, they testified, and some raised legal concerns before it was released in September. Ms. Williams recounted a September meeting between Mr. Pence and Mr. Zelensky in which the Ukrainian president explained in dramatic terms how failing to provide the money would only help Russia. \u201cAny signal or sign that U.S. support was wavering would be construed by Russia as potentially an opportunity for them to strengthen their own hand in Ukraine,\u201d Ms. Williams said, relaying what Mr. Zelensky told Mr. Pence. For Colonel Vindman in particular, the testimony amounted to an unusual act of public criticism of the president by a White House employee \u2014 and it came at an immediate cost. The colonel, who came to the United States as a refugee at 3, referred to his family\u2019s history in Ukraine, a former Soviet republic, noting that in Russia, \u201coffering public testimony involving the president would surely cost me my life.\u201d Addressing his father, who he credited with \u201cthe right decision\u201d in leaving the Soviet Union to seek refuge in the United States 40 years ago, Colonel Vindman said, \u201cDo not worry, I will be fine for telling the truth.\u201d But as Colonel Vindman sat in the stately House Ways and Means Committee Room, the official, taxpayer-funded Twitter account of the White House posted a critical quote in which Tim Morrison, his former boss at the National Security Council, questioned Colonel Vindman\u2019s \u201cjudgment.\u201d Mr. Morrison, the council\u2019s former senior director for Russia and Europe, testified in a second session that went well into Tuesday evening alongside Kurt D. Volker, the former United States special envoy to Ukraine. Public testimony from both men had been requested by Republicans, but they also confirmed key details of the case Democrats are building against Mr. Trump. In carefully calibrated testimony, Mr. Morrison confirmed that he and other White House officials had continuing concerns about Colonel Vindman\u2019s judgment, though he declined to discuss them at length. Mr. Morrison, who listened in on the July 25 call himself from the White House Situation Room, said he wished Colonel Vindman had come to him directly with his concerns. \u201cI think we both agreed we wanted that more full-throated support of President Zelensky and his reform agenda, and we didn\u2019t get it,\u201d Mr. Morrison said of the call. He reported it to White House lawyers himself, but only out of concerns it would be politically damaging if leaked. He said in questioning that he did not view the call as illegal or improper, but added of the requests for investigations that \u201cit\u2019s not what we recommend that the president discuss.\u201d Mr. Volker was more withering. \u201cI don\u2019t think that raising 2016 elections or Vice President Biden or these things I consider to be conspiracy theories that have been circulated by the Ukrainians\u201d were \u201cthings that we should be pursuing as part of our national security strategy with Ukraine,\u201d he testified. \u201cWe should be supporting Ukraine\u2019s democracy, reforms, its own fight against corruption domestically and the struggle against Russia and defense capabilities.\u201d Mr. Volker called Mr. Biden \u201can honorable man.\u201d Mr. Volker played a key role in negotiations during the summer between the Ukrainian government and the Trump administration over whether Mr. Zelensky would be granted an Oval Office meeting with the president. Among the conditions put on Mr. Zelensky was that he make a public commitment to investigating the debunked theory that someone in Ukraine, rather than Russia, was responsible for a hacking of the Democratic National Committee in 2016 and Hunter Biden\u2019s role as a board member of a Ukrainian energy company, Burisma. Much of his testimony revolved around Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, who appears to have instigated a push for investigations, and Gordon D. Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union, who put it into action. Mr. Sondland will testify publicly on Wednesday. Mr. Volker testified that while he was aware Mr. Trump wanted an investigation of Burisma, he did not make the connection at the time between Burisma and the Bidens. He said that he misunderstood that other officials meant the Bidens when they mentioned investigations of Burisma. \u201cIn retrospect, I should have seen that connection differently, and had I done so, I would have raised my own objection,\u201d he said. Mr. Volker also said he was also unaware that other officials saw a connection between the withholding of nearly $400 million in United States military aid to Ukraine and Mr. Zelensky\u2019s willingness to commit to the investigations sought by Mr. Trump. \u201cI did not know of any linkage between the hold on security assistance and Ukraine pursuing investigations,\u201d he testified. \u201cNo one had ever said that to me \u2014 and I never conveyed such a linkage to the Ukrainians.\u201d Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, a top Republican ally of the president\u2019s, cited Mr. Morrison\u2019s comment about Colonel Vindman and criticism from Fiona Hill, his former boss at the National Security Council, to ask why the witness\u2019s concerns ought to be considered relevant. \u201cAny idea why they have those impressions?\u201d Mr. Jordan asked. Colonel Vindman, who apparently came prepared for the criticism, pulled out a copy the performance evaluation Ms. Hill wrote about him in July, read aloud from it and pressed ahead with his account of what transpired. Soft-spoken at first, Colonel Vindman grew more confident in addressing lawmakers who criticized him as the hearing went on. \u201cRanking member, it\u2019s Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, please,\u201d he instructed the committee\u2019s top Republican, Representative Devin Nunes of California, after Mr. Nunes addressed him as \u201cMr. Vindman.\u201d In another exchange that touched on Colonel Vindman\u2019s loyalty to the United States, Steve Castor, the top Republican staff lawyer, asked him about three instances when Oleksandr Danylyuk, the director of Ukraine\u2019s national security council, had approached him with offers to become the country\u2019s defense minister. Colonel Vindman confirmed the offers and testified that he repeatedly declined, dismissing the idea out of hand and reporting the approaches to his superiors and to counterintelligence officials. \u201cEvery single time, I dismissed it,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cI\u2019m an American. I came here when I was a toddler.\u201d Mr. Danylyuk himself said Tuesday that the offer was not a serious one. Democrats fumed, accusing Republicans of sliming a patriot because he had a politically inconvenient story to tell. \u201cThey\u2019ve accused you of espionage and dual loyalties,\u201d said Representative Jim Himes, Democrat of Connecticut. \u201cThe three minutes we asked about the offer making you minister of defense \u2014 that may have been cloaked in a Brooks Brothers suit, but that was designed exclusively to give the right-wing media an opening to questioning your loyalties.\u201d Democrats also continued to push back against what they saw as efforts by Republicans to tease out the name of or information about the whistle-blower whose account of the July 25 call helped lead to the impeachment inquiry. Democrats sought throughout both hearings to redirect attention back to actions by Mr. Trump, who they said withheld the $391 million in assistance earmarked for Ukraine and a coveted White House meeting to get the political advantages he thought Ukraine could deliver him. It may be too early to fully know the effect the hearings are having on public opinion. Television ratings and opinion polls released in recent days suggest that public engagement has so far fallen short not only of hearings at the height of Watergate and the impeachment of President Bill Clinton, but of earlier blockbuster Trump-era congressional hearings. But it is harder to measure the reach of proceedings online and on social media. And after three long days of public testimony, House Republicans appeared to be holding together in Mr. Trump\u2019s corner, either unconvinced his behavior was as the witnesses described or unconvinced that it warranted a remedy as drastic as impeachment. \u201cAn impeachment inquiry is supposed to be clear,\u201d said Representative John Ratcliffe, Republican of Texas. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be obvious, it\u2019s supposed to be overwhelming and compelling, and if two people on the call disagree honestly about whether or not there was a demand and whether or not anything should be reported on a call, that is not a clear and compelling basis to undo 63 million votes and remove a president from office.\u201d",

Moderates sense a favorable shift.By Alexander BurnsPRINT EDITIONModerates Are Stepping Up to Seize the Day in the Democratic Primary|November 18, 2019, Page A16",

      "content": " LAS VEGAS \u2014 After spending months in anxious passivity, staking their hopes on Joseph R. Biden Jr. and little else, moderate Democrats appear suddenly determined to fight for control of their party in the 2020 elections. The shift in attitude has come in fits and starts over the last few weeks, seemingly more as an organic turn in the political season than as a product of coordinated action by party leaders. But each assertive act has seemed to build on the one before, starting with a debate-stage clash last month over \u201cMedicare for all\u201d and culminating in recent days with the entry of two new moderate candidates into the primary, Michael R. Bloomberg and Deval Patrick, and a gentle warning from former President Barack Obama that Democrats should not overestimate voters\u2019 appetite for drastic change. Most convincing to some Democrats may be the off-year elections this month in Kentucky and Louisiana, where moderate-to-conservative Democrats prevailed in governors\u2019 races that President Trump worked strenuously to win for his party. The victories bolstered the argument, advanced by some leading Democrats, that the party could peel away some of Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters in 2020 by avoiding \u201clitmus test\u201d battles and courting the political middle. \u201cClearly, factually, people who voted for Trump voted for our Democratic gubernatorial candidates,\u201d said Gov. Gina Raimondo of Rhode Island, a moderate who leads the Democratic Governors Association. She said Democrats could win those voters in 2020 with a \u201cmessage of unity\u201d and pragmatic promises on issues like health care and student debt. For months the Democratic race was defined in terms of which candidate could promise the most daring policy reforms \u2014 a contest in which Mr. Biden, the former vice president, was struggling to keep pace with Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont. As the most liberal candidates set the agenda, many in the party establishment squirmed, anxious about alienating moderate voters. Now the primary has become an increasingly jumbled contest, shaped by Democrats\u2019 competing appetites for visionary ideas, tactical realism and sheer political novelty. Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., appears to be harnessing those tensions to his advantage, at least in Iowa, where for the first time he emerged as a clear front-runner in a CNN/Des Moines Register poll this weekend. In Nevada, where more than a dozen candidates were gathered for the state party\u2019s \u201cFirst in the West\u201d dinner, Representative Dina Titus was holding up the Democrats\u2019 off-year victories as a reason for optimism heading into 2020. But Ms. Titus, who has not endorsed a candidate in the presidential race, urged the presidential field to be mindful of the \u201cmoderate Democrats in suburban districts\u201d who flipped control of the House last year. \u201cWe have just got to make sure that we appeal across the board,\u201d said Ms. Titus, who introduced both Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders at events this weekend. \u201cWe are a big-tent party.\u201d That proved to be true this month, at least in Louisiana and Kentucky. The Democratic victors in both states, Gov. John Bel Edwards of Louisiana and Andy Beshear, the governor-elect of Kentucky, ran on expanding health care coverage at the state level and largely avoided national issues, like impeachment. Mr. Edwards in particular positioned himself well to the right of the national Democratic Party, opposing abortion rights and new efforts to regulate firearms. No Democratic leaders believe either state will be in play at the presidential level in 2020, and few would argue that the party should shift as far to the right as Mr. Edwards in order to compete. But Representative Cedric Richmond of Louisiana, a leading supporter of Mr. Biden, said on Sunday that Democrats should take the election in his state as a sign that \u201cthe country is not as far to the left as people would have us believe.\u201d \u201cIf you look at Kentucky, if you look at Louisiana, it shows 2020 could be a very good year for Democrats,\u201d Mr. Richmond said, \u201cbut we have to read the tea leaves right, learn the real lesson of what these races are saying.\u201d Many Democratic voters still appear determined to find a Goldilocks-like option in the race \u2014 a candidate who both generates excitement and soothes concern about the general election, someone who promises sweeping change but appears capable of winning Republican votes. Ms. Warren climbed in the polls for months on the strength of her reform message and a mastery of policy that conveyed reassuring competence, but her poll numbers have slipped recently amid intensive scrutiny of her health care plans. Ms. Warren has attempted to allay voters\u2019 reservations on that front in recent weeks by pledging not to raise middle-class taxes to pay for her plans. She also described how she would prioritize improvements to the Affordable Care Act, including the creation of an optional government health-insurance plan, before attempting to create a single-payer system. Both Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders remain among the best-positioned candidates in the primary election, with distinctive appeal to young people and other voters seeking a large-scale redraw of the political system \u2014 an overlapping agenda that drew roars of approval at the \u201cFirst in the West\u201d dinner. At the dinner, both expressed disdain for incremental politics, with Mr. Sanders saying that \u201ctinkering around the edges just won\u2019t do what needs to be done\u201d and Ms. Warren dismissing more modest policies as \u201ca nibble here and a nibble there.\u201d Both are polling at or near the top of the pack in three of the four early primary states, including Nevada. And both are actively working to persuade voters that their approach is the better bet in a general election, including by appealing to voters who feel alienated from the political system. \u201cIf the best that Democrats can offer is business as usual after Donald Trump, then Democrats will lose,\u201d Ms. Warren said at a campaign stop here on Sunday afternoon. \u201cWe win when we have solutions for the problems in people\u2019s lives.\u201d Andrea Griffin, an elementary school nurse in Las Vegas, said she had been wary of Ms. Warren as a general-election candidate but came away feeling more confident after watching her on Sunday. \u201cI was a little skeptical about a plan for everything, but she has a pretty good grasp on what the major issues are and I kind of think that she might be able to get it done,\u201d said Ms. Griffin, 56, a former independent voter who said she registered as a Democrat two weeks ago. Ms. Griffin said she was also curious about Mr. Buttigieg, but had essentially ruled out Mr. Biden, explaining, \u201cI think America is not ready to go back to business as usual.\u201d While he is consistently leading national polls, Mr. Biden\u2019s vulnerability in the primary appears to come, at least in part, from his seeming inability to inspire Democratic voters. He is seen as a sensible and safe option, and a conventionally steady hand for the presidency. At the Nevada Democrats\u2019 dinner on Sunday evening, Mr. Biden urged primary voters to think cautiously: \u201cWe\u2019d better be real careful about who we nominate,\u201d he warned, \u201cbecause the risk of nominating someone who wouldn\u2019t beat Trump is a nation and a world that our children and our grandkids won\u2019t want to live in.\u201d For a good number of primary voters, that appeal is persuasive enough: At Mr. Biden\u2019s town hall-style event in Las Vegas the night before, Phyllis Lind, a retired health care worker who is becoming a substitute teacher, explained her thinking about the race in terms that conveyed her party\u2019s conflicting impulses. She said she was drawn to Ms. Warren because she was \u201cfor the common person,\u201d and to Mr. Buttigieg because he had personal charisma \u201clike Obama.\u201d But at the moment, Ms. Lind, 73, said she was firmly supporting Mr. Biden. \u201cWe need to have a candidate that is going to also get the moderate Republicans,\u201d Ms. Lind said. At the moment, Mr. Buttigieg seems to be claiming an inchoate space that lies between Mr. Sanders\u2019s ideological movement and Mr. Biden\u2019s unapologetically tactical approach to the election. But his rise in the polls has been chiefly confined to the earliest primary states, Iowa and New Hampshire, and he has not generated interest among African-American and Latino voters, cornerstones of the Democratic coalition. At the dinner in Nevada, Mr. Buttigieg repeatedly struck the theme of unity, pledging to \u201cbring together an American majority\u201d for Democratic policies. His prepared remarks also included a rebuke seemingly aimed at Ms. Warren: the text circulated to reporters had Mr. Buttigieg saying that no one should be \u201cwritten out of a particular political party\u201d because of a policy disagreement \u2014 an apparent allusion to Ms. Warren\u2019s recent barb suggesting Mr. Biden might be running in the wrong party\u2019s primary because of his attacks on the idea of single-payer health care. But Mr. Buttigieg did not deliver the line, instead saying he wanted support from people \u201cwhether you are a progressive or a moderate or what I like to call a future former Republican.\u201d Mayor John Cranley of Cincinnati, a moderate Democrat who supports Mr. Buttigieg, said he saw the shift toward Mr. Buttigieg as a function of voters\u2019 intense concern about defeating Mr. Trump. \u201cI think that it\u2019s clear Democrats are focused on winning,\u201d Mr. Cranley said. Pointing to neighboring Kentucky, the northern bulge of which houses the suburban bedroom communities of his own city, Mr. Cranley argued that Mr. Beshear\u2019s victory with right-leaning voters there could be a case study for the national party. To win there, Mr. Cranley said, \u201cYou can\u2019t have somebody who is to the far left on some of these issues.\u201d",

      "author": "Reid J. Epstein",
      "content": "  [Follow our live coverage of tonight\u2019s Democratic debate.] Ten Democratic presidential candidates will take the debate stage in Atlanta on Wednesday night, but the spotlight is likely to follow two contenders who have risen to the top of polls over the last several months: Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. Here is what to watch for as the candidates debate: Last month in Ohio, Ms. Warren took incoming fire from four different rivals. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Mr. Buttigieg led the attack against her health care proposals, Senator Kamala Harris of California made a disjointed plea for Ms. Warren to sign onto her call for Twitter to ban President Trump and Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii demanded to know how Ms. Warren was qualified to serve as commander-in-chief. Since then, Ms. Warren has seen her polling position diminish as she has sought to explain how she would finance \u201cMedicare for all\u201d beyond the \u201cI\u2019m with Bernie\u201d line that she offered earlier in the campaign. But the attacks against her haven\u2019t stopped. She remains a useful foil for Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg \u2014 along with Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota \u2014 as they jostle to be the standard-bearer for the party\u2019s moderate wing. Ms. Warren has shown no indication she\u2019s willing to give ground. During a speech to Iowa Democrats this month she used the word \u201cfight\u201d 21 times in 12 minutes. Her argument that the party will lose to Mr. Trump if it nominates a candidate who fears her bold proposals has become central to her campaign stump speech. Expect both dynamics to be on full display in Atlanta, though this time Ms. Warren will be prepared to defend Medicare for all in a more detailed fashion than she has demonstrated to date. For weeks, aggravation about Mr. Buttigieg among his rivals has been simmering. It\u2019s about to boil over Wednesday night. With the 37-year-old holding a commanding first-place position in the latest Des Moines Register poll, his opponents are ready to attack him. Ms. Harris said Mr. Buttigieg would \u201chave to answer\u201d for using a stock photograph from Kenya to illustrate his plan for African-Americans on his campaign website. Ms. Klobuchar has taken her quiet asides about his lack of experience to the Sunday talk shows. And Ms. Warren dismissed Mr. Buttigieg for running a \u201cconsultant-driven campaign with some vague ideas that are designed not to offend anyone.\u201d At the same time, the volume of opposition research being pitched by rival campaigns about Mr. Buttigieg has increased, focusing on 9-year-old friendly remarks about the Tea Party and his stewardship of the municipal government in South Bend. In previous debates, Mr. Buttigieg has easily parried attacks from his rivals \u2014 that task will become tougher as scrutiny on him increases. While Ms. Warren laid out a plan last week to pass a full Medicare for all system by her third year in the White House, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont said he\u2019d get it done right away. \u201cI will engage that struggle on day one of my administration,\u201d Mr. Sanders said Friday in California. \u201cNot put it off for several years.\u201d Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren, long ideological partners, have mostly avoided direct conflict on the campaign trail. But the Medicare for all issue affords each of them an opportunity to create political distance. Mr. Sanders can once again brand himself as the purest advocate for his political revolution. Ms. Warren, meanwhile, will have to navigate between appealing to the party\u2019s most progressive voters and not frightening away moderate Democrats by tying herself too closely to Mr. Sanders. The Democratic differences on how to fix America\u2019s health care system have consumed much of the airtime in debate after debate, and the coming clash in Atlanta is expected to be more of the same. In the last debate, Ms. Warren was hammered for lacking her own Medicare for all plan. She has since rolled out a comprehensive package that more moderate Democrats, like Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg, have said is unrealistic and unworkable. Mr. Biden has used health care to raise other questions about Ms. Warren, calling her an elitist with a \u201cmy way or the highway\u201d approach to governance. Mr. Buttigieg has been advertising in Iowa to promote his \u201cMedicare for all who want it\u201d approach, which Ms. Warren has said will not fundamentally fix the system. The recent Des Moines Register/CNN poll showed how divided the party is on the topic, with 36 percent favoring a Medicare for all plan that eliminates private insurance, 34 percent wanting a \u201cpublic option\u201d and 20 percent saying they preferred restoring provisions in the Affordable Care Act. Midway through the second week of impeachment gobbling the entire Washington news cycle, the presidential candidates would still rather talk about almost anything else. Yet it seems implausible \u2014 if not impossible \u2014 for Wednesday night\u2019s debate moderators to avoid asking the White House hopefuls about the House inquiry unfolding daily on live television. But what can the candidates say at this point? They\u2019re all for impeaching Mr. Trump. But while they know that wanting the president removed from office is the cost of entry for the Democratic primary, voters would much rather see a discussion about the sort of issues that are central to their daily lives: health care, climate change and the economy. Even Tom Steyer, the California billionaire who spent years on a campaign calling for Mr. Trump\u2019s impeachment, is talking about other issues on the trail. So expect to see the moderators quiz the candidates about the latest developments from Washington, as they then pivot to something else. Things are not going well for the California senator. Since the last debate, she has shuttered her New Hampshire offices. She has laid off staff and shifted resources from her Baltimore headquarters to Iowa. And she has continued a slide in the polls, which now show her closer to the bottom tier than to the top. The challenge is that Ms. Harris has already delivered one of the most memorable debate moments of the primary \u2014 her takedown of Mr. Biden on busing \u2014 but the bump she received quickly faded. She has since turned her focus on Mr. Trump in one debate, and challenged Ms. Warren to call for kicking the president off Twitter in another. She does not have a signature policy focus \u2014 she has called to cut middle-class taxes as a top priority \u2014 that seems ripe to pop. It is not clear what tack she will take on Wednesday evening (she could be among the many ready to pile onto Mr. Buttigieg), but the pressure to perform is strong.",

      "author": "Katie Glueck",
      "content": "  CONCORD, N.H. \u2014 Senator Elizabeth Warren is \u201cinstructing\u201d voters on what to believe. Her policy vision smacks of an \u201cacademic exercise.\u201d Her advocacy style is \u201cmy way or the highway,\u201d and she has displayed an \u201celitist attitude.\u201d In ways overt and subtle, Joseph R. Biden Jr., his campaign and his allies have begun mounting personal attacks on his most formidable rival in the 2020 primary race, portraying her as embracing a rigid, condescending approach that befits a former Harvard professor with an ambitious policy agenda. It is a politically risky case to make against a leading female candidate, especially to a Democratic primary electorate that has so far signaled little appetite for intraparty warfare. Women historically make up a majority of Democratic primary voters, and for many, memories of attacks against Hillary Clinton in 2016 are still fresh. The aggressive approach is also new territory for Mr. Biden, the former vice president who served for decades as a decorous senator and typically tempers rebukes of opponents with mentions of their good character. Ms. Warren, who generally refrains from sparring with her rivals, has started to push back, denouncing criticism from \u201cpowerful men\u201d who try to tell women how to behave. The back-and-forth between the two candidates signals the start of a more combative phase of the 2020 race, with their jousting largely focused on Ms. Warren\u2019s $20.5 trillion plan to pay for a sweeping \u201cMedicare for all\u201d program. Democratic pushback against that plan has buoyed Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign, which is keenly aware of Ms. Warren\u2019s political momentum in key states like Iowa, where the first nominating contest will be held in less than three months. After the Biden team dismissed her Medicare for all plan, Ms. Warren suggested critics were embracing Republican talking points and even running in the wrong party \u2014 remarks that Mr. Biden found personally galling, advisers and allies said. He responded in a toughly worded statement and in a fund-raising appeal on Tuesday, casting Ms. Warren\u2019s response as \u201ccondescending,\u201d reflective of an \u201cangry unyielding viewpoint\u201d and \u201crepresentative of an elitism that working- and middle-class people do not share.\u201d He repeated versions of that argument in a radio interview and at fund-raisers throughout the week, decrying Ms. Warren\u2019s \u201cattitude\u201d in a way that struck some voters and political operatives as sexist, and others as ironic, given that he sometimes made this populist argument at his own events with big donors. On Friday, Mr. Biden told reporters at New Hampshire\u2019s State House here that \u201cthe next president of the United States is going to have to make sure that they\u2019re able to get things done, pass things.\u201d He added, \u201cGoing after people\u2019s motives or instructing them on what they should believe is not the way that you get things done.\u201d Ms. Warren, who caught up to or surpassed Mr. Biden in some polls this fall and now faces the scrutiny that comes with being a leading candidate, fired back on Friday, sending a fund-raising email with the subject line, \u201cI am angry and I own it.\u201d \u201cOver and over, we are told that women are not allowed to be angry,\u201d Ms. Warren wrote in the message, which did not mention Mr. Biden. \u201cIt makes us unattractive to powerful men who want us to be quiet.\u201d She added: \u201cWell, I am angry and I own it. I\u2019m angry on behalf of everyone who is hurt by Trump\u2019s government, our rigged economy, and business as usual.\u201d Asked on Saturday if she thought Mr. Biden would describe her as angry and condescending if she were a man, Ms. Warren replied, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask him that?\u201d The confrontation between the two leading candidates reflects the unsettled nature of the Democratic primary race, where Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren are now squaring off as the two leading candidates while she is also playing both offense and defense on Medicare for all. But just as apparent are the gender dynamics and dangers in personal attacks for a Democratic field that began with a record number of female candidates but is now dominated by three white men \u2014 Mr. Biden, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. \u2014 and Ms. Warren, of Massachusetts. Mr. Biden\u2019s attacks, in effect if not intent, include descriptions that some voters and researchers on women and politics see as sexist tropes about female politicians: portraying them as overbearing, schoolmarmish or different from the norm. \u201cThe question is whether Biden would use the same words to describe a male professor \u2014 and I suspect he would,\u201d said Gloria Steinem, the feminist leader. \u201cThe larger problem is that they\u2019re about style, not content.\u201d His criticism of Ms. Warren troubled some voters who came to see her on the campaign trail over the weekend. \u201cI think it\u2019s sexist,\u201d Savannah Johnson, 49, a social worker who supports Ms. Warren and who attended a town hall she held in Goose Creek, S.C., on Saturday, said of Mr. Biden\u2019s criticism. \u201cI just don\u2019t think that he\u2019d be saying the same thing about a male candidate,\u201d she added. \u201cI think that all strong women kind of get labeled that unfairly.\u201d Niamh Cahill, 21, a college student who also came to the town hall, said Ms. Warren would not be getting as much grief if she were a male candidate. \u201cYeah, she\u2019s fired up, she\u2019s angry, but for a good reason,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are a lot of things that are wrong in this country.\u201d Mr. Biden often discusses his record of advocacy for women\u2019s rights by citing his championing of the Violence Against Women Act and his work combating campus sexual assault. And none of his remarks have come close to the audaciously sexist language and tactics that President Trump used against female political opponents like Mrs. Clinton and Carly Fiorina in the 2016 campaign or his offensive and demeaning language about Megyn Kelly, Stormy Daniels and the women he referenced in his taped interview with \u201cAccess Hollywood.\u201d Mr. Biden said in a CNN interview that his criticisms of Ms. Warren had \u201cnothing to do with\u201d gender. He and his allies said he was focused on debating the merits of policy and approaches to leading and governing. \u201cAs an African-American woman who serves as mayor of Atlanta, I know what sexism and racism looks and feels like and I don\u2019t see it here,\u201d said Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, who has endorsed Mr. Biden. \u201cWhen people propose these great plans, how will they be paid for? I think people expect to have real answers to that. And I think to the extent that you\u2019re touting plans I think you need to be prepared to explain it and not create distractions.\u201d Still, for Ms. Warren, being called elitist is squarely at odds with how she introduces herself to voters. She often discusses growing up in Oklahoma on the \u201cragged edge of the middle class\u201d and is running for president as a corruption-fighting populist. Mr. Biden\u2019s words conjured Ms. Warren\u2019s career as a Harvard law professor \u2014 a title that could unsettle voters without college degrees, a demographic with which Mr. Biden is currently strong, polls show. On the campaign trail, Ms. Warren talks about her time as a law professor but does not draw attention to her affiliation with Harvard, and she notes in her stump speech that she went to a public law school (she attended Rutgers). On Friday, Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign issued a news release slamming her Medicare for all proposal as unrealistic, arguing, \u201cbeing president isn\u2019t an academic exercise.\u201d The message reminded some Democrats of how Scott Brown, the incumbent in the 2012 Massachusetts Senate race, unsuccessfully sought to caricature Ms. Warren as an out-of-touch professor. \u201cI don\u2019t think it will work for the Biden team, either, because first of all, her personal story is the antithesis of anything elitist,\u201d said Mary Anne Marsh, a Boston-based Democratic strategist unaligned in the presidential primary, though some of her colleagues have worked on Ms. Warren\u2019s prior races. \u201cShe\u2019s done a very, very good job consistently defining her life story.\u201d Mr. Biden is hardly dismissing Ms. Warren as a \u201cprofessor.\u201d And his campaign noted that he had used words like \u201celitist\u201d and \u201cangry\u201d to describe Republican men before. His allies are also trying to tap into increasingly vocal pushback against Medicare for all and its potential political consequences from Democrats in 2020 battleground states; House Speaker Nancy Pelosi also recently warned that such a plan, and its elimination of private health insurance, carries significant political risk. And he is plainly uncomfortable repeating in person the fierce criticism about Ms. Warren\u2019s \u201ccondescending\u201d style that he issued in his Tuesday statement. Asked directly if he felt Ms. Warren was out of touch, he replied to reporters, \u201cI\u2019m not saying she\u2019s out of touch. What I\u2019m saying is, the way to approach politics today to get things done is not to question people\u2019s motives.\u201d \u201cI wasn\u2019t referring to Elizabeth Warren as being elitist,\u201d Mr. Biden insisted at another point during an exchange with reporters here. \u201cI said the American people out there, they understand what\u2019s going on, and they don\u2019t like being instructed on what they should believe and what they don\u2019t believe.\u201d In big primary fields, attackers can often damage their opponent \u2014 but hurt themselves in the process. That has been the case for multiple Democratic contenders who have swung at Mr. Biden in personal terms, only to face blowback. For Mr. Biden now, the risk is especially great because he is seen by many voters as a warm and gracious figure in the party \u2014 and harsh attacks could seem out of character. Still, for some voters, the clash between Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren was illuminating more than worrisome. \u201cI like that it\u2019s personal,\u201d said Stanley Brown, 49, of Tilton, N.H., who attended a Biden event on Friday and is considering Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren along with several other candidates. \u201cThey care. It\u2019s not just a canned answer.\u201d",

      "content": " It was a busy week in the Democratic presidential campaign, with a flood of new policies and, of course, another debate. Let\u2019s get right to it. There weren\u2019t a lot of sparks in this week\u2019s debate, the fifth of the Democratic primary. But in the absence of a clear front-runner, several lower-polling candidates were able to break through \u2014 at least for one news cycle. Senators Kamala Harris of California, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Cory Booker of New Jersey all had strong nights. So did Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., who did not face nearly as many attacks as expected in his first appearance since he shot to the top of the field in Iowa. Mr. Buttigieg has had a remarkable rise in Iowa, rocketing from 9 percent (fourth place) in a CNN/Des Moines Register poll in September to 25 percent (first place) in one released last weekend. Between that and a Monmouth University poll four days earlier also showing him in first place, it is clear that Mr. Buttigieg has become a serious contender there. The bad news for him: He is polling terribly among black voters. A Quinnipiac poll in South Carolina, where black Democrats are the most powerful voting bloc in the primary, showed him at 0 percent in that group. And while his current supporter base could be enough for him to win Iowa, which is mostly white, no Democrat in modern history has won the presidential nomination without winning a majority of black voters. After the debate, several candidates fanned across Atlanta to pitch themselves to black audiences. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts gave a speech at Clark Atlanta University on Thursday evening, saying that \u201crace-neutral laws\u201d were not enough, and that the government had an obligation to mend the damage caused by \u201cdecades of active, state-sponsored discrimination.\u201d She was joined onstage by Representative Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, who has endorsed her, and Ms. Pressley ended up speaking directly to pro-charter-school protesters who interrupted the speech. Earlier in the day, Ms. Harris held a \u201cblack women\u2019s breakfast,\u201d and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont gave a speech tying his family\u2019s experience in the Holocaust to the discrimination black Americans face. Mayor Wayne Messam of Miramar, Fla., ended his presidential campaign on Wednesday. If you hadn\u2019t known he was running to begin with, well, don\u2019t worry about it. Mr. Messam had never appeared on a debate stage, reaching only 1 percent in exactly two debate-qualifying polls all year, and had raised a mere $15,000 in the third quarter. \u201cI knew the odds were a steep hill to climb, but I have always fought for what is right and will continue to break barriers never broken,\u201d he said in announcing his withdrawal. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. introduced a wide-ranging plan this week to expand on the Violence Against Women Act. Among other things, it would create a new housing program for survivors of sexual assault and domestic abuse, require colleges and universities to improve reporting systems, establish a task force on online harassment and provide $100 million a year to end the backlog of untested rape kits. The proposal also focuses on survivors\u2019 ability to sue: It would ban mandatory arbitration clauses that block employees from suing over sexual harassment and restore a provision in the act that would allow people to take civil action against their abusers in federal court. The Supreme Court blocked that provision in 1999, and Mr. Biden is calling on Congress to pass a version that \u201cfills the gaps the Court found fatal last time.\u201d Mr. Biden was one of seven candidates who released plans this week \u2014 including Ms. Warren, who, as is her wont, released two. We will leave you with Ms. Harris\u2019s reaction after Mr. Biden, touting an endorsement from former Senator Carol Moseley Braun of Illinois, said he had the support of the only black woman elected to the Senate.",

      "author": "Lisa Lerer",
      "content": " Hi, and welcome to a special post-debate edition of On Politics. I\u2019m Lisa Lerer, your host. Yesterday afternoon, when our benevolent politics editor Patrick Healy asked what I expected to hear at the debate last night, I shot back full of confidence and that classic political reporter swagger. Pile on Pete. Duh. The question, I argued, wasn\u2019t whether the candidates would go after Pete Buttigieg but how he\u2019d deal with the flood of attacks on his policies, lack of experience and inability to win over voters of color. Well, dear readers, revoke my conventional wisdom card right now. I was wrong. Really wrong. Last night\u2019s debate was notable more for what didn\u2019t happen that what did: The South Bend mayor skated. Coming into the debate, there were several leading candidates who needed to do something to try to slow Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s momentum. Others, like Senators Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey, could have benefited from taking a shot at a top-tier candidate, particularly one who has struggled to connect with black voters. No one did anything to stop his rise. Sure, there were a handful of attacks. Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii went after Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s record on foreign policy, a charge he deflected by launching into a broadside on Ms. Gabbard\u2019s much-derided meeting with the President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, a \u201cmurderous dictator.\u201d Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota went after Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s background, questioning whether his experience as mayor of South Bend, Ind., \u2014 a city of about 100,000 people \u2014 makes him ready for the White House. \u201cThere\u2019s more than 100 years of Washington experience on this stage, and where are we right now as a country?\u201d Mr. Buttigieg fired back. And Ms. Harris, who has continued her slide in the polls, whiffed her attack over his campaign website\u2019s use of a stock photo from Kenya to illustrate his plan to combat racism in the United States. Mr. Buttigieg responded by talking about his history leading a \u201cracially diverse city\u201d and as a gay man. Of course, a good night hardly means Mr. Buttigieg is unstoppable. His weakness with voters of color, which is evident in tons of polls, is a real problem. No Democrat in recent political history has won the party\u2019s presidential nomination without the support of black voters. But Mr. Buttigieg, who has opened a lead in Iowa in recent polling, is hoping a victory there can help him win over skeptical voters in the more diverse primaries that follow. There\u2019s no indication anyone on that stage last night took steps to sow the kinds of doubts that would stop him from moving forward with his plan. Or his momentum. Plenty of other stuff happened last night, too! Here\u2019s some of what we were watching. The candidates touched on a number of topics that hadn\u2019t really been explored in the past four debates: paid family leave, affordable housing and the potential cost of deconstructing President Trump\u2019s border wall, to name a few. But none led to sharp exchanges, as the candidates favored quippy one-liners over sustained attacks. With little conflict to help distinguish the candidates on a number of issues, the consensus among my colleagues was that the debate was, well, boring. Nearly all the previous debates revolved around Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren and their health care plans. This time, they were mostly relegated to background players on the stage. While both had brief moments, neither lodged a particularly memorable line. And health care, for the first time in five rounds of debates, didn\u2019t dominate the discussion. When asked about the Me Too movement, former Vice President Joe Biden said that Americans just have to keep \u201cpunching at it, and punching at it, and punching at it\u201d to change the culture of violence against women. \u201cI come out of the black community,\u201d Mr. Biden said, perplexingly, at a later point. And at least one of his flubs prompted incredulous cross talk from others on the stage, when he suggested that only one black woman had been elected to the Senate. Ms. Harris, who was standing two lecterns over, is the second. While those comments will rile up those who oppose him, they seem unlikely to seriously shake his strong support among black voters. The Hawaii congresswoman took more incoming fire than in any previous debate, as rivals painted her as a closet Republican and a conservative media darling who loves nothing more than attacking the Democratic Party she aims to lead. Analysis of her support shows that she draws more from conservatives and Republicans than any other candidate, so it\u2019s unclear whether this will hurt her modest standing in the race.

ShearPRINT EDITIONNovember 20, 2019",
      "author": "Peter Baker",
      "content": "  Follow our live coverage of David Holmes and Fiona Hill\u2019s testimony in the Trump impeachment hearings. Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s two senior most aides pushed back against their colleague, Jennifer Williams, on Tuesday after she testified that she considered President Trump\u2019s phone call with Ukraine\u2019s president \u201cunusual\u201d because of its focus on domestic politics. \u201cI heard nothing wrong or improper on the call,\u201d Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, the vice president\u2019s national security adviser, said in a written statement released after her testimony. \u201cI had and have no concerns. Ms. Williams was also on the call, and as she testified, she never reported any personal or professional concerns to me, her direct supervisor, regarding the call. \u201cIn fact,\u201d he added, \u201cshe never reported any personal or professional concerns to any other member of the vice president\u2019s staff, including our chief of staff and the vice president.\u201d Marc Short, the vice president\u2019s chief of staff, went on Fox News to make the same point. \u201cShe said she found the call unusual yet she never raised any concerns with her supervisor General Kellogg, she never raised any concerns with the chief of staff, she never raised any concerns with the vice president,\u201d he said. He added: \u201cWe have impeachment in pursuit of a crime.\u201d Mr. Trump attacked Ms. Williams on Twitter on Sunday, writing that she should read the transcript of the call and then \u201cmeet with the other Never Trumpers, who I don\u2019t know & mostly never even heard of, & work out a better presidential attack!\u201d The two former officials testifying on the afternoon panel were both originally on the Republican witness list in hopes that their accounts would provide testimony that would be more useful to President Trump\u2019s defense. But while neither was as damning as the morning witnesses, both highlighted how unusual the president\u2019s actions were. \u201cI don\u2019t think that raising 2016 elections or Vice President Biden or these things I consider to be conspiracy theories that have been circulated by the Ukrainians\u201d were \u201cthings that we should be pursuing as part of our national security strategy with Ukraine,\u201d Kurt D. Volker, the president\u2019s former special envoy for Ukraine,  told the House Intelligence Committee. \u201cWe should be supporting Ukraine\u2019s democracy, reforms, its own fight against corruption domestically and the struggle against Russia and defense capabilities and these are at the heart of what we should be doing and I don\u2019t think pursuing these things serves a national interest,\u201d he added. Timothy Morrison, the former senior director for Europe and Ukraine at the National Security Council, said he did not think the president\u2019s July 25 call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine was inherently wrong or illegal, but feared it would ignite a political storm if it became public. \u201cI feared at the time of the call on July 25 how its disclosure would play in Washington\u2019s climate,\u201d he said. \u201cMy fears have been realized. I understand the gravity of these proceedings, but beg you not to lose sight of the military conflict underway in Ukraine today.\u201d During later questioning, Daniel S. Goldman, the Democratic counsel, asked: \u201cBut you would agree, right, that asking a foreign government to investigate a domestic political rival is inappropriate, would you not?\u201d \u201cIt is not what we recommend the president discuss,\u201d Mr. Morrison replied curtly. Mr. Volker portrayed himself as left out of key moments and unaware that others working for Mr. Trump were linking the release of American security aid to Ukraine committing to investigations of Democrats. Opening the second panel of the day, Mr. Volker sought to reconcile his original closed-door testimony with the accounts of other witnesses who came after him. \u201cI have learned many things that I did not know at the time of the events in question,\u201d he said in his opening statement. Among other things, he said that at the time he worked with Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal attorney, to seek assurances from Ukraine about investigations he was pushing, he did not understand those investigations to include former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. as a target nor did he know that they would be tied to release of the frozen security aid. \u201cI did not know of any linkage between the hold on security assistance and Ukraine pursuing investigations,\u201d Mr. Volker said. \u201cNo one had ever said that to me \u2014 and I never conveyed such a linkage to the Ukrainians.\u201d He recalled telling the Ukrainians \u201cthe opposite,\u201d that they did not need to do anything to get the hold lifted and that it would be taken care of. \u201cI did not know others were conveying a different message to them around the same time,\u201d he said. Mr. Volker sought to clarify why his testimony about the now-famous July 10 meeting at the White House differed from those of Fiona Hill, then the senior director for Europe and Russia at the National Security Council, and Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman, her Ukraine policy deputy. Ms. Hill and Colonel Vindman testified that John R. Bolton, then the national security adviser, ended the meeting abruptly when Gordon D. Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union, brought up the investigations and that some in the room took the conversation downstairs where it turned heated. Mr. Volker mentioned none of that in his original testimony. \u201cAs I remember, the meeting was essentially over when Ambassador Sondland made a general comment about investigations,\u201d he said on Tuesday. \u201cI think all of us thought it was inappropriate. The conversation did not continue and the meeting concluded. Later on, in the Ward Room, I may have been engaged in a side conversation or had already left the complex, because I do not recall further discussion regarding investigations or Burisma.\u201d More generally, he said he did not interpret the word Burisma to be tantamount to Mr. Biden. \u201cIn hindsight, I now understand that others saw the idea of investigating possible corruption involving the Ukrainian company Burisma as equivalent to investigating former Vice President Biden. I saw them as very different \u2014 the former being appropriate and unremarkable, the latter being unacceptable. In retrospect, I should have seen that connection differently, and had I done so, I would have raised my own objections.\u201d Mr. Volker expressed annoyance at being lumped together with Mr. Sondland and Energy Secretary Rick Perry as \u201cthree amigos,\u201d as if they were somehow indistinguishable, and he rejected the notion that he was part of an irregular foreign policy channel. The term \u201cthree amigos\u201d has come to characterize how the usual foreign policy process was warped by Mr. Trump\u2019s interest in obtaining damaging information about Democrats from Ukraine. It originated from an interview Mr. Sondland gave to Ukrainian television when he said \u201cwe have what are called the three amigos,\u201d naming Mr. Volker, Mr. Perry and himself. Mr. Volker in his testimony objected to the name and the implication. \u201cI\u2019ve never used that term and frankly cringe when I hear it,\u201d he said. In his mind, he said, he associated the phrase with his mentor, Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who died last year, and two allies who supported a troop surge in Iraq in 2006 and 2007, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut, who has since left the Senate. Mr. Volker said he was not part of a shadow foreign policy because he was the officially designated diplomat assigned to help resolve Ukraine\u2019s war with Russia. \u201cMy role was not some irregular channel, but the official channel,\u201d he said, noting that he reported to Rex W. Tillerson, the secretary of state who appointed him, and Mike Pompeo, his successor, and coordinated with diplomats and White House officials. Democratic lawmakers responded angrily to attacks on Colonel Vindman,  who testified during the morning session, as the White House and Republicans sought to discredit the colonel in real time during his appearance before the committee. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of insinuations and there\u2019s been a lot suggestions, maybe, that your service is somehow not to be trusted,\u201d said Representative Sean Patrick Maloney, Democrat of New York. He accused Republicans of trying to \u201cair out some allegations with no basis and proof, but they just want to get them out there and hope maybe some of those strands of spaghetti I guess will stick on the wall if they keep throwing them.\u201d His angry remarks came after the official, taxpayer-funded Twitter account of the White House posted a critical quote about Colonel Vindman from Mr. Morrison, his former boss at the National Security Council, who testified later in the day on a separate panel. Earlier, Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio had cited that comment as well as criticism from Ms. Hill, Colonel Vindman\u2019s former boss at the National Security Council. \u201cAny idea why they have those impressions?\u201d Mr. Jordan inquired. Colonel Vindman, who apparently came prepared for the criticism, pulled out a copy the performance evaluation Ms. Hill wrote about him in July and read aloud from it. \u201cAlex is a top one percent military officer and the best army officer I have worked with in my 15 years of government service,\u201d Colonel Vindman said, quoting Ms. Hill. \u201cHe is brilliant, unflappable, and exercises excellent judgment.\u201d Republicans also questioned the loyalty of Colonel Vindman, an American citizen and decorated Army combat veteran who was born in Ukraine, by asking him about three instances when Oleksandr Danylyuk, the director of Ukraine\u2019s national security council, had approached to offer him the job of defense minister in Kyiv. Under questioning by the committee\u2019s Republican counsel, Colonel Vindman confirmed the offers and testified that he repeatedly declined, dismissing the idea out of hand and reporting the approaches to his superiors and to counterintelligence officials. The line of questioning seemed to be designed, at least in part, to feed doubts about Colonel Vindman\u2019s commitment to the United States, the subject of a wave of character attacks on him by Mr. Trump\u2019s allies. Fox News quickly picked up on the tactic, sending out a news alert moments after Mr. Castor finished: \u201cVindman says Ukrainian official offered him the job of Ukrainian defense minister.\u201d Mr. Maloney said he was particularly outraged by questions from a Republican lawmaker questioning why Colonel Vindman wore his Army dress uniform to the hearing. \u201cThat dress uniform includes a breast plate that has a combat infantryman badge on it and a purple ribbon,\u201d Mr. Maloney said. \u201cIt seems if there is someone who should wear that uniform, it\u2019s someone who has a breast plate on it.\u201d Two senior national security officials at the White House challenged Mr. Trump\u2019s description of his call with the Ukraine president as \u201cperfect,\u201d testifying on Tuesday about how concerned they were as they listened in real time to Mr. Trump appealing for an investigation of Mr. Biden. Colonel Vindman testified that he was so disturbed by the call that he reported it to the council\u2019s top lawyer. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe what I was hearing,\u201d he said under questioning about his first thoughts when he heard Mr. Trump\u2019s mention of investigations into Mr. Biden and an unproven theory that it was Ukraine, not Russia, that interfered in the 2016 election. \u201cIt was probably an element of shock, that maybe in certain regards, my worst fear of how our Ukraine policy could play out was playing out, and how this was likely to have significant implications for U.S. national security.\u201d Earlier, Colonel Vindman explained why he felt it was his \u201cduty\u201d to report his concerns to John Eisenberg, the top lawyer at the National Security Council. \u201cIt is improper for the president of the United States to demand a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen and political opponent.\u201d Ms;Williams, a national security aide to Mr. Pence, said she found the president\u2019s call unusual because it included discussion of a \u201cdomestic political matter.\u201d Their testimony kicked off three days of hearings featuring nine diplomats and national security officials as Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee continue to build their case that Mr. Trump abused his power by trying to enlist Ukraine to publicly commit to investigations that would discredit Mr. Biden, a leading political rival, and other Democrats. In a cabinet meeting as the hearing unfolded, Mr. Trump praised his allies and dismissed the hearings as a \u201ckangaroo court,\u201d saying, \u201cRepublicans are absolutely killing it, because it\u2019s a big scam.\u201d Colonel Vindman and Ms. Williams both testified that they were never aware of any other national security officials in the United States government who supported the decision to withhold nearly $400 million in security aid for Ukraine, which both said was directed by the White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney. Both witnesses said withholding the military assistance from Ukraine was damaging to relations between the two countries and to Ukraine\u2019s ability to confront Russian aggression. Representative Mike Quigley of Illinois asked Colonel Vindman whether anyone else supported the decision to freeze the aid. \u201cNo one from the national security?\u201d Mr. Quigley asked. \u201cNone,\u201d Colonel Vindman said. \u201cNo one from the State Department?\u201d \u201cCorrect.\u201d \u201cNo one from the Department of Defense? \u201cCorrect.\u201d Ms. Williams testified that President Volodymyr  Zelensky of Ukraine told Vice President Mike Pence during a Sept. 1 meeting that continuing to withhold the aid would indicate that United States support for Ukraine was wavering, giving Russia a boost in the ongoing conflict between the two countries. \u201cAny signal or sign that U.S. support was wavering would be construed by Russia as potentially an opportunity for them to strengthen their own hand in Ukraine,\u201d Ms. Williams said, relating what Mr. Zelensky told Mr. Pence. Representative Devin Nunes of California, the top Republican on the committee, sought to turn the focus away from Mr. Trump to Mr. Biden, leading the witnesses through a series of questions intended to suggest that the former vice president had intervened in Ukraine\u2019s domestic affairs to benefit his son, Hunter Biden, despite the lack of evidence. Mr. Biden, as vice president, pressured Ukrainian officials to fire a prosecutor who was seen as tolerating corruption in keeping with the policy of the United States, European allies and international financial organizations at the time. But Mr. Nunes suggested that Mr. Biden was acting to benefit his son, who was on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company that had been investigated for corruption. \u201cDid you know that Joe Biden called Ukrainian President Poroshenko at least three times in February 2016 after the president and owner of Burisma\u2019s home was raided on February 2 by the state prosecutor\u2019s office?\u201d Mr. Nunes asked, referring to Petro O. Poroshenko, then the president. \u201cNot at the time,\u201d Ms. Williams answered. She added: \u201cI\u2019ve become aware of that through this proceeding.\u201d Mr. Nunes asked a series of similar questions and then repeated them for Colonel Vindman. Neither witness was working on the issue at the time,  so neither could offer information to about it. But Mr. Nunes used the opportunity to introduce his allegations, anyway. He also tried repeatedly to extract information from Colonel Vindman about the identity of the whistle-blower who filed a complaint about Mr. Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine, drawing objections from the colonel\u2019s lawyer. At one point, things turned testy when Mr. Nunes addressed Colonel Vindman as \u201cMr. Vindman.\u201d \u201cRanking member, it\u2019s Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, please,\u201d he shot back.  ",

      "author": "Alexander Burns",
      "content": "  The Democratic presidential candidates yielded to the furor surrounding the impeachment inquiry in Washington in their primary debate on Wednesday, for the first time training their fire more steadily on President Trump than on one another and presenting a largely united front on vital issues like climate change and abortion rights. One month after the party\u2019s moderate wing led a ferocious attack against Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts at the previous debate, the leading Democrats opted to mute their rivalries and restrain their language, mainly detailing their disagreements in gentle or at most passive-aggressive terms. There were moments of direct friction, especially in the final minutes of the debate over matters of national security, but in many cases the candidates\u2019 criticism was couched within jocular one-liners or pragmatic arguments about electability. Most telling were a handful of sharper exchanges among the 10 candidates onstage in Atlanta related to matters of race and gender. Several expressed concerns about the prospect of nominating a white man, like former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. or Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. Senators Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of California both warned that the party could not afford to select a candidate who was not capable of exciting African-American voters, and Ms. Harris repeatedly invoked \u201cthe Obama coalition\u201d as the Democrats\u2019 best hope for electoral success. \u201cBlack voters are pissed off and they\u2019re worried,\u201d Mr. Booker said, lamenting that too many African-American voters hear from Democratic candidates only during election season. He also rebuked Mr. Biden for expressing resistance last weekend to legalizing marijuana, joking, \u201cI thought you might have been high when you said it.\u201d Mr. Buttigieg and Mr. Biden both insisted they were capable of marshaling support from minority voters. Mr. Buttigieg acknowledged that he faced \u201cthe challenge of connecting with black voters\u201d who do not know him yet, and Mr. Biden argued that his present strength with African-American primary voters spoke for itself. \u201cI was part of that coalition,\u201d he said, even adding: \u201cI come out of the black community.\u201d As for the Obama coalition, Mr. Biden once again referred to his personal bond with the former president: \u201cI was part of that coalition,\u201d he said. It was widely anticipated that Mr. Buttigieg would become a kind of political pin cushion onstage, as other Democrats sought to harry him as the emerging front-runner in Iowa. But it was only in the final moments of the debate that he drew sustained criticism, first from Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and then, more caustically, from Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii. But it was unclear whether anyone raised new doubts about the young mayor as a contender for the nation\u2019s most powerful office. Ms. Klobuchar noted that Mr. Buttigieg, 37, had lost his only statewide election, and lacked a governing record on issues, like voting rights, that he talked about on the campaign trail.  \u201cI think experience should matter,\u201d she said. But Mr. Buttigieg, using a recurring tactic of deflection, dismissed the value of experience in Washington and cited his service in the military. Ms. Gabbard was a more persistent adversary, rebuking Mr. Buttigieg for saying in a recent interview that he might be willing to deploy American troops in Mexico to fight violence there. Mr. Buttigieg again held his ground, calling Ms. Gabbard\u2019s characterization of his remarks \u201coutlandish\u201d and chiding her for having met with the \u201cmurderous dictator\u201d Bashar al-Assad during a trip to Syria. But for the most part, the Democrats focused on denouncing Mr. Trump. That was in part because, unlike at previous debates, the moderators avoided stoking rivalries and highlighting differences. Yet the lack of vitriol and the intense focus on electability also owed to the nature of this campaign, which as the impeachment inquiry unfolds is becoming even more centered on finding the best candidate to defeat the president. The candidates attacked Mr. Trump both for his actions toward Ukraine that have prompted impeachment proceedings and for a longer litany of offenses, including his detention of children at the Mexican border, his warm relationships with dictatorial governments in Saudi Arabia and North Korea and his appointment of political cronies to prominent jobs. The debate also highlighted the considerable areas of agreement across the Democratic field on overarching policy goals, including taking aggressive action to counter climate change, expanding voting rights and restoring traditional American alliances around the world. Ms. Warren used the impeachment inquiry, and the testimony on Wednesday by Gordon D. Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union and a Trump donor, to criticize the practice of installing wealthy political supporters in overseas embassies. Mr. Booker railed against Mr. Trump for what he described as his human rights violations at the southern border, such as \u201cwhen children are thrown in cages.\u201d Ms. Harris jabbed that Mr. Trump \u201cgot punked\u201d by Kim Jong-un, the North Korean dictator, in nuclear negotiations. For Ms. Klobuchar, it was Mr. Trump\u2019s forgiving treatment of Saudi Arabia after its agents kidnapped and killed the journalist Jamal Khashoggi. \u201cThat sent a signal to dictators around the world that that\u2019s O.K.,\u201d Ms. Klobuchar said. Still, if there were no heated moments likely to endure past the evening, as there had been in past debates, there were fault lines within the field, separating the most progressive candidates, like Ms. Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, from comparatively moderate figures like Mr. Biden, Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Klobuchar. Mr. Buttigieg, who eagerly assailed Ms. Warren\u2019s health care policies at the debate in October, was far more veiled in his criticism this time, arguing that Democrats must \u201cgalvanize not polarize\u201d a coalition representing a majority of voters. And Ms. Klobuchar suggested that there were candidates who were making big promises \u201cbecause they sound good on a bumper sticker and then throw in a free car.\u201d But neither of them named names or tried a direct attack as they had done last month. Similarly, Ms. Harris, whose campaign has been on a downward spiral in the polls, notably declined an opportunity to confront Mr. Buttigieg. The leading candidates of the left took much the same approach. Mr. Sanders, defending his support for single-payer health care, referred to skeptical competitors who he said believed \u201cthat we should not take on the insurance company, we should not take on the pharmaceutical industry.\u201d But he did not say to whom he was referring. Mr. Sanders took only an oblique shot at Ms. Warren, who has not prioritized his \u201cMedicare for all\u201d legislation, noting that he would introduce his single-payer system \u201cin the first week\u201d of his presidency. Mr. Biden did not appear to incur new damage to his campaign, which has been durable despite some of his self-inflicted errors. Yet at a moment when a pair of new candidates were entering the race in part because of his perceived weakness, the former vice president appeared tongue-tied on more than one occasion. He drew nervous laughter when, in discussing domestic violence, he said it was important to keep \u201cpunching at\u201d the problem. And when he was boasting about receiving the support of the first African-American woman elected to the Senate, former Senator Carol Moseley Braun, he referred to her as the only black woman elected to the body rather than the first. That prompted a bemused response from Ms. Harris. \u201cThe other one is here,\u201d she said. Mr. Biden, who has staked his campaign on the perception that he is a strong general election candidate, focused on his broad appeal, urging Democrats to pick a nominee who could \u201cgo into states like Georgia and North Carolina and other places and get a Senate majority.\u201d It was, atypically, Mr. Booker, normally a nonconfrontational voice on the debate stage, who opened a more contentious phase in the first half of the debate, critiquing Ms. Warren\u2019s proposal for a tax on the nation\u2019s largest fortunes. \u201cIt\u2019s cumbersome,\u201d Mr. Booker jabbed. \u201cIt\u2019s been tried by other nations. It\u2019s hard to evaluate.\u201d The exchanges grew notably less polite, though, when Ms. Harris was offered a chance to respond on a foreign policy question that went to Ms. Gabbard, who had targeted Ms. Harris at a debate over the summer. Ms. Harris, with payback in mind, ignored the policy element of the question and unloaded on Ms. Gabbard. She noted that her rival had been a frequent guest on Fox News, refused to call Mr. al-Assad \u201ca war criminal\u201d and \u201cbuddied up to Steve Bannon\u201d during Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential transition. Ms. Gabbard responded that Ms. Harris was merely offering \u201clies and smears and innuendo\u201d and asserted that the senator would continue the \u201cBush-Clinton-Trump foreign policy of regime change wars.\u201d Mr. Buttigieg, who is rising rapidly in the polls in Iowa, found himself for the first time in the position of defending his qualifications for the presidency. Mr. Buttigieg, who has never held statewide office, argued that from the vantage point of South Bend it was \u201cthe usual way of doing business in Washington is what looks small.\u201d Two of Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s rivals pushed back more or less gently. Mr. Booker, a former mayor of Newark, described himself as \u201cthe other Rhodes scholar mayor on this stage\u201d \u2014 perhaps his most pointed expression of feeling overlooked in the race. But it was Ms. Klobuchar who most effectively pivoted from her past criticism of Mr. Buttigieg, whom she has described as benefiting in the race from being male, into a forceful plea to the country to elect a female president. \u201cWomen are held to a higher standard, otherwise we could play a game called name your favorite woman president,\u201d Ms. Klobuchar said, brandishing one of her favorite lines from the campaign trail: \u201cIf you think a woman can\u2019t beat Donald Trump, Nancy Pelosi does it every single day.\u201d While she was not as pugilistic as in the last forum, Ms. Klobuchar enjoyed another series of memorable moments in this debate, including a crack about raising money from ex-boyfriends. The businessman Andrew Yang, who has attracted a strong niche following of mostly younger voters, received little time but drew a mix of applause and laughs when he was called on. Asked what he would say, as president, in his first phone call with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, Mr. Yang responded, \u201cWell, first I\u2019d say I\u2019m sorry I beat your guy.\u201d Since the debate last month, the race has become more fluid than ever; former Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts has entered the primary contest, and former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York has taken steps to do the same. They have been lured into the campaign in part over their concerns about the leftward drift in the party, and also because there is still no clear front-runner with just over two months until the Iowa caucuses. It remains far from certain that they will be able to catch on so late in the race, but both have made clear that they are trying to win over more moderate voters.",

What Do They Want?Many of the existential questions gripping the Democratic Party center on one mysterious figure: the \u201cmoderate\u201d voter.By Giovanni RussonelloPRINT EDITIONModerate Voters Still Hold Sway. But Which Way Are They Swaying?|November 24, 2019, Page A25",
      "author": "Giovanni Russonello",
      "content": " Welcome to Poll Watch, our weekly look at polling data and survey research on the candidates, voters and issues that will shape the 2020 election. Do Democratic voters want a transformational, visionary candidate for president, or someone who vows to restore stability? Is it most important to marshal the Democratic base, or to win over swing voters? Is there really enough support for a \u201cMedicare for all\u201d type of health care system? These are the kinds of existential questions gripping a Democratic Party with no clear front-runner, as it lurches toward the first contests in the 2020 primary season. And many of those questions center on one mysterious figure: the \u201cmoderate\u201d voter. \u201cWhile the progressives have been the focus of a lot of the debates, the fact of the matter is that there\u2019s a lot of moderates out there within the party that are struggling, trying to figure out who they\u2019re going to vote for,\u201d Jim Manley, a longtime Democratic strategist who advised Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s clear to me that none of the folks in the race so far have been able to seal the deal with those voters.\u201d The Democratic Party has trended strongly to the left in the past two decades: At the start of the millennium, Democrats were most likely to call themselves moderates, but now more than half identify as liberal, according to Gallup polling. But a stronger ideological consolidation has happened on the Republican side: Roughly three-quarters of\u00a0Republican voters now call themselves conservative. As a result, moderates still lean Democratic just as heavily as they did 20 years ago, and they will play a central role in defining the direction of the party. They have shifted to the left on some issues, but remain center-left on others. It has been over 40 years since a Democrat won the presidency without earning more than 55 percent of the moderate vote, according to exit polls. Mrs. Clinton won only a slim majority of moderates in 2016, at 52 percent. That year, Donald J. Trump became the first presidential candidate in the history of modern exit polling to win with only 40 percent support from moderate voters. But it was an unorthodox case: Both major-party candidates were disliked by a majority of voters, and 8 percent of moderates who voted in the general election didn\u2019t vote for either of them, according to exit polls. Today, Mr. Trump is still seen about as unfavorably by most Americans as he was in 2016, so Democrats hope that putting forth a more popular candidate will help them secure a wider majority of moderate voters, paving their path to the White House. Indeed, moderates deeply disapprove of the job Mr. Trump is doing as president: 58 percent of all moderates expressed disapproval of him in an NPR/Marist poll last month, while just 35 percent approved. \u201cOnce we get into the general, it\u2019s going to be incumbent on Democrats to pick up the moderate voters necessary to defeat Trump,\u201d Mr. Manley said. As the Democratic Party has moved to the left, moderate voters have followed the trend on issues like gun control, climate change and wealth inequality. But on other questions, such as military spending and abortion rights, they tend to hold decidedly less progressive views than their liberal counterparts. This is particularly true when it comes to health care: By more than 20 points, they are less likely than liberal Democrats to say they would prefer a government-run health care system, a result that\u2019s consistent across various polls. That helps explain why center-leaning candidates such as Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. have refused to endorse a Medicare for all plan, which they fear could endanger their chances in the general election \u2014\u00a0and may not be necessary to capturing the Democratic nomination. Still, pinning down voters can be hard at the fluid center of the ideological spectrum. \u201cSome people are genuinely moderate, in the sense that on most issues they hold moderate positions,\u201d William Mayer, a political scientist at Northwestern University who has studied swing voters, said in an interview. \u201cThere are some people who are moderates because they have relatively strong feelings about a lot of issues, but those issues kind of cancel out.\u201d What, then, would moderate voters actually like the next president to accomplish? By wide margins, Democratic primary voters tend to tell pollsters that they would prefer a candidate who will take a new and different approach from former President Barack Obama. But moderate and conservative Democrats are more evenly split, with much greater numbers saying they\u2019d like to return to the way things were four years ago. This is driven in part by black moderates\u2019 allegiance to Mr. Obama\u2019s legacy, pointing to a possible source of durability for Mr. Biden\u2019s support among the crucial, African-American portion of his base. And it also points to the changing demographics of the moderate vote itself. As the white Democratic electorate has grown more liberal and more highly educated, the party\u2019s moderate bloc has become increasingly diverse. For the first time ever, moderate and conservative Democrats are now roughly as likely to be nonwhite as they are to be white. Even among younger voters, people of color are less likely to call themselves very liberal than their white counterparts. Black voters are expected to make up a quarter of all Democratic primary voters next year, a higher share than ever before\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and in the 2016 Democratic primaries, half of black voters identified as moderate or conservative. About two-fifths of Latino voters did. Latino voters have grown more solidly Democratic in recent decades, and they are expanding as a voting bloc: The number of new Latino voters registering rose threefold between 2014 and 2018, according to an analysis by Voto Latino, a media and advocacy group for Latino voters. Pew has predicted that Hispanics will make up the largest nonwhite group of voters in 2020. Meanwhile, white voters without college degrees \u2014 who are the most likely white voters to call themselves moderate \u2014 are increasingly defecting to Mr. Trump\u2019s Republican Party. If trends continue, they may make up less than a quarter of the Democratic primary electorate next year. There are other potential misconceptions about moderate voters to dispel. Just because they are less ideological does not mean moderates are less engaged: In a Quinnipiac University poll last month, three in five moderate and conservative Democratic voters said they were paying close attention to the campaign \u2014 slightly higher than the share of liberal Democrats. And while many young people do identify as liberals, it is in fact voters under 50 who are most likely to say they are moderate.",

But it can give us the perspectives of some of the people with expertise on primary races: veteran campaign strategists, consultants and advocates from both parties. Here is a sampling of their reactions. Senator Kamala Harris of California, trying to stop her campaign\u2019s slide, got perhaps her best reviews since the first debate in June \u2014 the one that shot her up in the polls for a few weeks. Commentators were not unanimous on Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., \u2014 who has risen to or near the top of recent polls, especially in Iowa \u2014 but for the most part, they thought he did well under the increased scrutiny. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota earned praise for several responses, but most prominently her defense of her argument that she and the other women running would struggle to win support with Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s level of political experience. And Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey did well against former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts had the most speaking time of any candidate but did not make the biggest impression. But strategists and commentators generally said she and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont did what they needed to do to maintain their positions in the race, and both of them had standout moments \u2014 especially on impeachment for Ms. Warren and climate change for Mr. Sanders. In what has become a pattern, Mr. Biden drew good marks for his responses on foreign policy \u2014 consistently a strong point for him in debates \u2014 but groans for his responses on race.",

SchmidtPRINT EDITIONNovember 21, 2019",
      "author": "Michael S. Schmidt",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Gordon D. Sondland, the diplomat at the center of the House impeachment inquiry, kept Secretary of State Mike Pompeo apprised of key developments in the campaign to pressure Ukraine\u2019s leader into public commitments that would satisfy President Trump, two people briefed on the matter said. Mr. Sondland informed Mr. Pompeo in mid-August about a draft statement that Mr. Sondland and another American diplomat had worked on with the Ukrainians that they hoped would persuade Mr. Trump to grant Ukraine\u2019s new president the Oval Office meeting he was seeking, the people said. Later that month, Mr. Sondland discussed with Mr. Pompeo the possibility of pushing the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to pledge during a planned meeting with Mr. Trump in Warsaw that he would take the steps being sought by Mr. Trump as a way to break the logjam in relations between the two countries, the people said. Mr. Pompeo expressed his approval of the plan, they said, but Mr. Trump later canceled his trip to Poland. The disclosures link Mr. Pompeo more directly to the Trump administration\u2019s pressure campaign on Ukraine. It is not clear how specific Mr. Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union, was in his communications with Mr. Pompeo about what was being asked of the Ukrainians. But Mr. Pompeo was among those who had listened in on a call between the two leaders on July 25, when Mr. Trump explicitly asked Mr. Zelensky for investigations into former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and into a debunked conspiracy theory about Ukrainian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign. A lawyer for Mr. Pompeo declined to comment. Mr. Sondland is scheduled to testify on Wednesday in the impeachment proceedings against Mr. Trump, and he is expected to face tough questioning about gaps and misleading statements in the deposition he provided the committee last month. Mr. Sondland is sure to be grilled in particular about his failure to tell the committee about a phone call on July 26 with the president in which Mr. Trump, according to another American diplomat who overheard the call, asked Mr. Sondland if Mr. Zelensky had agreed to the investigation of Mr. Biden. Mr. Sondland later told the diplomat, David Holmes, that when it came to Ukraine, Mr. Trump was only interested in \u201cbig stuff\u201d that would benefit him, like the \u201cBiden investigation\u201d that his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani was pushing for. Mr. Sondland\u2019s exchanges with Mr. Pompeo suggest that he could use his testimony to counter the testimonies of other administration officials, who have said that Mr. Sondland was part of a team operating outside of normal foreign policy and national security channels that sought to do the bidding of Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani. In August, Mr. Sondland and the special envoy to Ukraine, Kurt D. Volker, were in negotiations with a top Ukrainian official, Andriy Yermak, about a public statement making a commitment to investigating Mr. Biden and the energy company Burisma, which had placed Mr. Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden on its board. Mr. Giuliani had been pressing for that commitment and for Mr. Trump\u2019s request that Mr. Zelensky\u2019s government look into whether Ukrainians, not Russians, were behind the hacking of the Democratic National Committee in 2016. Mr. Sondland and Mr. Volker have testified that they sought to get the Ukrainians to release the statement in order to satisfy Mr. Giuliani and, by extension, Mr. Trump, and to reset relations between the two countries. The Ukrainians never did it. Mr. Pompeo has said little publicly about what he knew about the pressure campaign on Ukraine, but he has publicly criticized the Democrats\u2019 impeachment investigation, claiming that it has been unfair to Mr. Trump and the State Department. The secretary of state had acceded to Mr. Trump\u2019s order in the spring that he recall the United States ambassador to Ukraine, Marie L. Yovanovitch, who had been the target of a campaign of criticism involving Mr. Giuliani and two of his associates. While Mr. Pompeo heard Mr. Trump make his demands for the investigations into the Bidens and the 2016 election on the July 25 call with Mr. Zelensky, it is not clear what he knew, or when, about the freeze over the summer of $391 million in United States military aid to Ukraine. After a meeting on Sept. 1 between Mr. Pence and Mr. Zelensky in Warsaw, Mr. Sondland told Mr. Yermak that the resumption of the aid was tied to an agreement by Ukraine to make a commitment to the investigations sought by Mr. Trump, according to testimony made to the House impeachment inquiry. Mr. Sondland is one of the few witnesses who spoke directly with Mr. Trump about Ukraine, making his testimony especially important for Democrats. Republicans are expected to try to undercut his credibility by laying out an array of discrepancies in it. Mr. Sondland initially told the committee that he believed there was no link between the investigations Mr. Trump wanted and the release of the military aid. But two weeks after he was deposed, Mr. Sondland amended his testimony, and said the reverse. After he did that, new witnesses came forward to describe events Mr. Sondland had not told the committee about. Among them was Mr. Holmes, a State Department staff member in Kyiv, Ukraine\u2019s capital, who said in his deposition to the House Intelligence Committee that he overheard the call Mr. Sondland had with Mr. Trump in July after Mr. Sondland met with Mr. Zelensky. \u201cPresident Zelensky \u2018loves your ass,\u2019\u201d Mr. Holmes said he heard Mr. Sondland tell Mr. Trump. \u201cI then heard President Trump ask, \u2018He\u2019s going to do the investigation?\u2019\u201d Mr. Holmes said. \u201c\u2018He\u2019s going to do it,\u2019\u201d Mr. Holmes said Mr. Sondland responded.",

      "subtitle": "5 Takeaways From the November Democratic DebateIt was a mostly bloodless evening among the 10 candidates onstage, but there were some standout moments.By Shane Goldmacher, Reid J. Epstein and Lisa LererPRINT EDITIONNovember 21, 2019",
      "author": "Shane Goldmacher",
      "content": "   With polls showing a highly competitive primary race and no clear front-runner, the Democrats in Wednesday\u2019s debate acted as if they had decided ahead of time to avoid taking risks or doing much of anything that might cause them to lose momentum at this stage of the campaign. It was not flashy. It might not be memorable. But it was revealing. Here are five takeaways: For much of the night, the showdown in Atlanta felt more like a candidate forum than a true clash of visions, as contender after contender seemed more than satisfied to go long periods reciting elements of their stump speeches, rather than contrasting with one another on policy. They disagreed politely with one another, and agreed repeatedly about the menace of President Trump. \u201cI think Joe is right,\u201d Senator Bernie Sanders said at one point to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. \u201cI just want to stick up for Tom,\u201d the businessman Andrew Yang piped up for the billionaire Tom Steyer. \u201cThanks, Andrew,\u201d Mr. Steyer replied. And so it went on  a mostly bloodless evening marked more by civility than caustic confrontations \u2014 besides, that is, Representative Tulsi Gabbard, who sparred aggressively with both Senator Kamala Harris and Mayor Pete Buttigieg, of South Bend, Ind., generating two of the three most tweeted moments of the debate, according to Twitter. A viewer tuning into this debate for the first time would be hard-pressed to say who exactly is the Democratic front-runner in the 2020 primary. Mr. Biden? Sure, he leads in all the national polls, but few onstage seemed eager to challenge him after others who\u2019ve targeted him \u2014 Ms. Harris in June and Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former housing secretary, who did not qualify for this debate \u2014 have faded afterward. Senator Elizabeth Warren? She sure seemed to look like the front-runner a month ago, when she was the object of most of the attacks. But not on Wednesday. The top four candidates \u2014 Mr. Biden, Mr. Buttigieg, Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren \u2014 all spoke the most but none of them suffered against sustained incoming. Hours before the debate, Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign had accidentally sent out a post-debate email that hinted of plans to take on Ms. Warren (\u201cWe need more than plans\u201d), but no such thing materialized onstage. The story of the debate was more of punches pulled than landed. A month after her rivals hammered Ms. Warren for a lack of \u201cMedicare for all\u201d specifics, her fresh $20.5 trillion package to remake the health care system received surprisingly little scrutiny. Mr. Sanders hit Mr. Biden at one point for his support of the Iraq war, but the moderators quickly moved on. Perhaps Mr. Biden\u2019s biggest swing of the night was aimed at an unusual target: dinging the low-polling Mr. Steyer for his past investments in coal. The evening before the debate, one of Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s top advisers, Lis Smith, posted a GIF about debate preparations for an onslaught of attacks to come. That did not happen, at least not until the final moments of the debate, and by then Mr. Buttigieg was settled in onstage. When Senator Amy Klobuchar took a swipe at him as a \u201clocal official,\u201d he was ready with the retort: \u201cThere\u2019s more than 100 years of Washington experience on this stage, and where are we right now as a country?\u201d When Ms. Gabbard accused Mr. Buttigieg of saying he wanted to send troops to Mexico, he brushed her aside. \u201cDo you seriously think anyone on this stage is proposing invading Mexico?\u201d he said. For a candidate who has now vaulted toward the top of the field in Iowa, Mr. Buttigieg skated through most of the evening with surprisingly little scrutiny. Ms. Harris was among those given a chance to take a shot at Mr. Buttigieg over diversity and his lack of support among black voters, but she mostly chose not to do so. Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s response showed his dexterity as a politician, pivoting to his own lived experiences as a married gay man who understood discrimination deeply and personally, if differently. \u201cI care about this because while I do not have the experience of ever having been discriminated against because of the color of my skin, I do have the experience of sometimes feeling like a stranger in my own country,\u201d he said. The Minnesota senator, who is on a slow but steady climb in Iowa polls, drew sharp distinctions between herself and the candidates she perceives as her most effective foils: Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Warren. In a debate devoid of any signature moments or significant rhetorical battles, Ms. Klobuchar delivered a performance designed to appeal to Democrats nervous about the party\u2019s leftward turn and unsure whether to hand the party to a 37-year-old executive of Indiana\u2019s fourth-largest city. \u201cI\u2019m not going to go for things just because they sound good on a bumper sticker and then throw in a free car,\u201d Ms. Klobuchar said. \u201cWe have an obligation as party to, yes, be fiscally responsible, yes, think big, but be honest.\u201d Her hope is that there are a lot of people in Iowa \u2014\u00a0 where Ms. Klobuchar has bet the future of her campaign \u2014 who are drawn to that message. She didn\u2019t back down when read her comments to The New York Times about Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s relative inexperience. Ms. Klobuchar said it\u2019s true that she believes the women running for president face higher standards than the men. Asked why her paid family leave proposal, 12 weeks, is less robust than what other candidates are offering, Ms. Klobuchar didn\u2019t apologize. And she even found an opportunity to deliver the best of the array of jokes she makes on the campaign trail. \u201cMy first Senate race I literally called everyone I knew and I set what is still an all-time Senate record,\u201d she said. \u201cI raised $17,000 from ex-boyfriends.\u201d For a candidate on the ropes, Senator Cory Booker, had an impressively strong evening. He landed a tough hit against Mr. Biden, delivering one of the most notable lines of the night when he wondered if Mr. Biden was \u201chigh\u201d for saying he opposed marijuana legalization on the federal level. \u201cMarijuana in our country is already legal for privileged people,\u201d Mr. Booker said. He argued that the party must nominate someone who can inspire black voters \u2014 a knock on Mr. Buttigieg, who has struggled to build support among communities of color. \u201cWe need to have someone that can inspire, as Kamala said, to inspire African-Americans to the polls in record numbers,\u201d Mr. Booker said. And he closed with one of the most direct pleas of the evening. Mr. Booker\u2019s solid performance in past debates hasn\u2019t been enough to change his fortunes in the race, and he is now at serious risk of failing to meet the polling and fund-raising standard necessary to make the December debate. \u201cKeep me on the stage,\u201d he all but begged, in his final statement. Afterward, Mr. Booker reported on Twitter that he had raised more online in the hour after the debate than on any previous fund-raising day.",

      "content": "  Pete Buttigieg was trying a little tenderness. \u201cI\u2019m running to be the president for that day the sun comes up and the Trump presidency is behind us,\u201d said the millennial mayor of South Bend, Ind., pumping his left fist a bit for the crescendo, \u201cwhich will be a tender moment in the life of this country.\u201d Senator Kamala Harris had another impulse. By Wednesday evening, the nation\u2019s foremost political drama had been confined to the capital, where marathon impeachment proceedings into President Trump have siphoned oxygen from the Democratic primary less than three months before the voting begins. Onstage in Atlanta, Mr. Trump\u2019s leading challengers had been asked a thorny political question: How do you run a campaign in impeachment\u2019s long shadow? \u201cWe have a criminal living in the White House,\u201d Ms. Harris said, nodding grimly before appearing to tweak Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s rosy view. \u201cAnd there is no question that in 2020, the biggest issue before us, until we get to that tender moment, is justice is on the ballot.\u201d The candidates\u2019 divergent messages laid bare a central tension in this Democratic primary: finding a way to stand out when the sitting president, tweeting and rampaging through impeachment, tends to edge into the frame whether or not he is in the room. With Democratic voters desperate to defeat a man they view as a singular threat, much of the primary has turned on the difficult-to-define question of electability \u2014 on who can take the fight most powerfully to Mr. Trump, how much emphasis that should earn in what is ostensibly an intraparty battle of ideas and who can piece together the most formidable coalition next fall. On Wednesday, several of the candidates embraced the kind of meta-punditry that voters have often demanded, sketching out their paths to victory in detail. Senator Amy Klobuchar and Mr. Buttigieg highlighted their Midwestern credentials, with Ms. Klobuchar noting her strength in \u201cred and purple\u201d congressional districts in her home state of Minnesota. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who has premised much of his candidacy on the idea that he stands the best chance against Mr. Trump, suggested that he was uniquely positioned not only to defeat Mr. Trump but also to help Democrats expand their ranks on Capitol Hill. But the most pointed argument came from Ms. Harris, perhaps alluding again to Mr. Buttigieg, who has glided to the top of early-state polls but still struggles mightily with voters of color, the bedrock of the party. \u201cWe need someone on that stage who has the ability to go toe to toe with Donald Trump,\u201d Ms. Harris said, \u201cand someone who has the ability to rebuild the Obama coalition.\u201d Mr. Buttigieg, playing to his biographical strengths, suggested the more useful electoral background was his own. \u201cWe need somebody who can go toe to toe who actually comes from the kinds of communities that he\u2019s been appealing to,\u201d Mr. Buttigieg said, nodding to Mr. Trump\u2019s popularity in parts of the industrial Midwest. \u201cI don\u2019t talk a big game about helping the working class while helicoptering between golf courses with my name on them. I don\u2019t even golf.\u201d Left unsaid on Wednesday, at a debate held in a large majority-black city, was that in a party that has long prided itself on its diversity, the top four candidates at present \u2014 Mr. Biden, Mr. Buttigieg, Senator Elizabeth Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders \u2014 are all white. Ms. Harris and Cory Booker, two black senators once seen as major contenders, have flagged in the polls. Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former federal housing secretary and the only Latino in the race, did not qualify for this debate. \u201cFor too long, I think, candidates have taken for granted constituencies that have been the backbone of the Democratic Party,\u201d Ms. Harris said a short while later, punctuating a forceful night. \u201cWhen it\u2019s close to election time, they show up at a black church.\u201d She spoke twice more about \u201cthe Obama coalition.\u201d \u201cI keep referring to that because that\u2019s the last time we won,\u201d she said. Mr. Buttigieg said he welcomed \u201cthe challenge of connecting with black voters in America who don\u2019t yet know me,\u201d noting that he runs a city \u201cthat is racially diverse and largely low-income\u201d and reflecting on his own experience with discrimination as a gay man. Mr. Biden, who in polls currently has a commanding lead with African-American voters, sought to emphasize his own credibility with that demographic \u2014 but he overlooked Ms. Harris, a black senator, in the process. \u201cI\u2019m part of that Obama coalition,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cI come out of the black community in terms of my support. If you notice, I have more people supporting me in the black community that have announced for me because they know me, they know who I am. Three former chairs of the black caucus, the only African-American woman that had ever been elected to the United States Senate \u2014\u201d Mr. Booker and Ms. Harris objected as the California senator, laughing, raised her arms in amusement. Mr. Biden clarified that he meant to say \u2014 or perhaps thought he said \u2014 the first African-American woman elected to the Senate, not the only one. As with past debates, a truism of presidential politics seemed to hold: Combat is the sincerest form of flattery. When Mr. Biden was dominating the polls early in the primary, debate nights devolved frequently into a stage-wide game of whack-a-veep. Last month, after Ms. Warren seemed to be overtaking him, she took her turn absorbing attacks. By evening\u2019s end on Wednesday, Mr. Buttigieg, who is leading in Iowa in the latest poll from The Des Moines Register and CNN, had reason to feel reasonably flattered. Ms. Klobuchar expressed her \u201cappreciation,\u201d a bit dismissively, for his work \u201cas a local official.\u201d Representative Tulsi Gabbard, who has delighted this year in criticizing other Democrats, called one of Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s recent comments about foreign policy \u201ccareless.\u201d Mr. Booker, joking of his \u201clifetime of experience with black voters\u201d as a black voter himself, seemed to have Mr. Buttigieg in mind when he said, \u201cNo one on this stage should need a focus group to hear from African-American voters.\u201d The former vice president was less eager to confront Mr. Buttigieg directly, even as the mayor seeks to emerge as a younger moderate alternative for voters alarmed at Mr. Biden\u2019s uneven performances. Mr. Biden stumbled on Wednesday as he sought to discuss one of his signature issues: health care. He intends to give Americans the option to maintain their private health insurance \u2014 but he initially contradicted himself. \u201cWe should build on Obamacare, provide the plan I put forward before anybody in here, adding a Medicare option in that plan and not make people choose \u2014 allow people to choose, I should say,\u201d he said. Mr. Biden, a former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was smoother when discussing foreign policy. And one of his strongest moments in the debate came when he said he would defer to his Justice Department on whether Mr. Trump should face a potential criminal investigation after he leaves office. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea that we model ourselves after Trump and say, \u2018lock him up,\u2019\u201d Mr. Biden said. Other flourishes were less elegant. At one point, he seemed to suggest that violence against women could be addressed by \u201cpunching\u201d it. \u201cNo man has a right to raise a hand to a woman in anger other than in self-defense, and that rarely ever occurs,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cSo we have to just change the culture, period, and keep punching at it and punching at it.\u201d It was probably always going to be an unusual evening. Even unmemorable debates generally monopolize the nation\u2019s political attention for at least a couple of hours. But on Wednesday, the day\u2019s chief political moment had plainly already happened, in Washington, by the time the candidates took the stage. More bizarre still, the debate did not feature the two would-be contenders whose renewed interest in the 2020 race has shadowed the primary recently: former Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts, who entered the contest last week, and former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York, who could follow him soon. Yet for all the candidates onstage \u2014 whether fighting for relevance, qualification for future debates or a polling lead \u2014 the forum supplied a crucial opportunity for airtime, and to test out new jokes or dust off old material. Ms. Klobuchar had a chance to deploy a well-practiced bit: \u201cMy first Senate race I literally called everyone I knew and I raised $17,000 from ex-boyfriends,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019d like to point out it is not an expanding base.\u201d Mr. Sanders jumped on the subject of Medicare for all with his catchphrase: \u201cI wrote the damn bill.\u201d When asked, Mr. Yang said that as president, his first comment to Russian leader Vladimir V. Putin would be, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I beat your guy.\u201d Mr. Booker laced into Mr. Biden\u2019s recently expressed reservations about legalizing  marijuana. \u201cI thought you might have been high when you said it,\u201d Mr. Booker said. Mr. Biden wobbled a bit behind his lectern, smirking. Yet in his closing remarks, Mr. Booker reminded viewers of a curious truth: He has not yet qualified for next month\u2019s debate.",

      "content": " At their best, they were clever and unscripted. A timely comeback. A witty one-liner. At their worst, they were robotic and rambling. Clumsy. Cringe-worthy. Here are some of the most memorable moments from Wednesday\u2019s Democratic presidential debate in Atlanta, hosted by MSNBC and The Washington Post. Senator Kamala Harris of California said President Trump had compromised the checks and balances on North Korea\u2019s nuclear capabilities with his unilateral dealings with the country\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un. She said Mr. Trump was the greatest threat to the national security of the United States, pointing to his decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement and the Iran nuclear deal, as well as his decision to pull American troops from Northern Syria. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts opened the debate by saying Gordon D. Sondland, the United States ambassador to the European Union, had no qualifications other than his $1 million contribution to President Trump\u2019s inaugural committee. Ms. Warren said Mr. Sondland\u2019s testimony during an impeachment proceeding in the House of Representatives on Wednesday added to the mounting evidence that President Trump had tied foreign aid to Ukraine to an investigation of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s son. Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., said that Mr. Trump was not putting critical military resources into things like artificial intelligence for border security. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota avoided a direct attack on Mr. Buttigieg when asked about her comment that a woman with his credentials would not be doing as well as a candidate. But Ms. Klobuchar did not shrink from the moment of getting a point across that women candidates are treated differently. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey created a buzz with his dig at Mr. Biden, who recently said he opposed the legalization of marijuana. Mr. Booker said Mr. Biden\u2019s position on cannabis was at odds with the progressive wing of the Democratic Party and many black Americans, who he said have been disproportionately hurt by criminal charges related to marijuana. Andrew Yang, the former tech executive and entrepreneur, was asked what he would say to Vladimir Putin in their first conservation if elected president. Mr. Yang answered that he would tell the Russian president that his \u201cdays of meddling in American elections are over.\u201d Mr. Biden quipped about a recent swipe at him by Mr. Kim, as quoted by North Korean state media. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont then interjected, \u201cOther than that, you like him,\u201d which drew laughs from the candidates and audience. Mr. Biden used the wrong metaphor as a point of emphasis when asking what he would do to address the culture of violence toward women in the United States. He started his answer by urging Congress to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, which Mr. Biden championed when he was a member of the United States Senate. Mr. Biden, who has enjoyed strong polling numbers among black voters, rattled off a list of endorsements of prominent African-American lawmakers and said there was reason that his appeal transcended racial lines. But Mr. Biden flubbed the number of black women who have served in the Senate: there have been two. He was endorsed by former Senator Carol Moseley Braun of Illinois, the first black woman elected to the chamber. The second, Ms. Harris, was onstage to his left.",

      "author": "Astead W. Herndon",
      "content": "  ATLANTA \u2014 One day after a televised debate featuring significant exchanges about race, Democratic presidential candidates fanned out across this capital of black political power to pitch their message to black voters and send a clear signal: Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. should not take support from African-Americans for granted. Mr. Biden\u2019s strength with black voters has been a key force in helping him maintain a polling edge in the race, even as the candidacies of Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont ascended among progressives. But on Thursday, both challengers \u2014 as well as Senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, two black candidates in the race, and other contenders \u2014 made explicit appeals about how they would address concerns and priorities of black voters. Ms. Warren, who is Mr. Biden\u2019s leading rival in many state and national polls, took direct aim at his reliance on black support by delivering one of her biggest speeches of the campaign, describing how governments and powerful corporations use racism and racial injustice as a wedge to divide working-class people. And she argued that it was time for the nation\u2019s policies to include specific correctives to address discrimination. \u201cDon\u2019t talk about race-neutral laws,\u201d she said at a rally on Thursday evening at Clark Atlanta University, a historically black institution. \u201cThe federal government helped create the racial divide in this country through decades of active, state-sponsored discrimination, and that means the federal government has a responsibility to fix it.\u201d \u201cThe rich and the powerful want us to be afraid of each other,\u201d Ms. Warren told the crowd. \u201cAnd why? Because they are afraid of us. Afraid of our numbers. Afraid of seeing us stand together.\u201d Ms. Warren also spoke directly to white voters, and pushed back on the notion that racial equity comes at the cost of white Americans. \u201cI just want to speak directly to the question on some white people\u2019s minds when we talk about the need to address what our government has done in black communities: the uncomfortable question of, \u2018What will this mean for me?\u2019\u201d Ms. Warren said. \u201cThe truth is, when we come together, we can all move forward.\u201d Ms. Warren\u2019s speech was a thematic continuation of her rally in New York City in September, when she used the Triangle shirtwaist factory fire of 1911 to tell a story of government regulation and the political power of women\u2019s voices. In her speech on Thursday Ms. Warren leaned on history again, citing the black women-led strike of Atlanta washerwomen in 1881. Ms. Warren was introduced by Representative Ayanna S. Pressley of Massachusetts, the black lawmaker who has become one of Ms. Warren\u2019s top surrogates after her recent endorsement. Ms. Pressley helped Ms. Warren calm a group of pro-charter school protesters who disrupted her speech. Earlier that day, several other candidates also targeted black voters, speaking at a breakfast held by the Rev. Al Sharpton\u2019s National Action Network. Ms. Harris attended a \u201cblack women power breakfast\u201d with several of Atlanta\u2019s leading black women professionals. And Mr. Sanders also held a rally on the campus of a historically black college. At Morehouse College, standing near a statue of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Mr. Sanders invoked his own background in a pitch to black voters. As a Jewish man whose family escaped Nazi Germany, he learned about the cruelties of racism through his family\u2019s stories of fleeing discrimination, he said. \u201cA lot of people in my father\u2019s family did not make it out of Poland, and they were murdered by the father of white supremacy, Adolf Hitler,\u201d he said. Black voters are an important constituency in the Democratic Party, and the candidate who has won a majority of the black vote has almost always gone on to be the party\u2019s nominee. But in a race with multiple black candidates and with white candidates promising policies specifically addressing racial inequities, the diversity of the black electorate \u2014 with respect to age, gender, education levels and ideology \u2014 has been on display. Still, it has been difficult for candidates to wrest black support away from Mr. Biden. He has been buttressed by sky-high name recognition, association with former President Barack Obama and his promise that he is best suited to win the white working-class voters who helped deliver the last election to President Trump. On Thursday, Mr. Biden met with a group of black mayors, including Keisha Lance Bottoms of Atlanta, who has endorsed him, before leaving for a town hall event in South Carolina, an early primary state where he leads in the polls. Speaking to reporters in Atlanta, Mr. Biden cited his long relationship with the African-American community in Delaware when asked about his support among black voters. \u201cI\u2019ve always been comfortable in the community, and I think that the community\u2019s always been comfortable with me,\u201d Mr. Biden said. In Wednesday night\u2019s debate, Mr. Booker criticized Mr. Biden for his opposition to legalizing marijuana, noting that black marijuana users are more frequently penalized than white ones. \u201cBlack voters are pissed off and they\u2019re worried,\u201d Mr. Booker said, adding that while he had \u201ca lot of respect\u201d for Mr. Biden, \u201cthis week I hear him literally say that \u2018I don\u2019t think we should legalize marijuana.\u2019\u201d Looking directly at Mr. Biden, Mr. Booker said, \u201cI thought you might have been high when you said it.\u201d At a ministers\u2019 breakfast meeting sponsored by the National Action Network, Mr. Booker continued his pitch a day later as the best candidate to address racial inequities in the economy and criminal justice. \u201cThe black-white wealth gap is growing. The leading cause of death for African-American boys and men is murder,\u201d Mr. Booker said. \u201cWe are at a point now that there\u2019s more African-Americans under criminal supervision than all the slaves in 1850.\u201d In impassioned remarks colored with scripture, Mr. Booker said the country needed to \u201censure that the next president of the United States doesn\u2019t have an academic appreciation of these issues, but actually has a passion, has an instinctual connection \u2014 is someone that we can trust to bring these issues to the front and center of the national agenda.\u201d A number of other candidates also toured Atlanta, making a concerted pitch to black voters. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., the entrepreneur Andrew Yang and the billionaire former hedge fund manager Tom Steyer attended Mr. Sharpton\u2019s breakfast, too. Mr. Buttigieg sought to establish common ground with the black audience, pointing out that, as a gay man, he had benefited from black activism during the civil rights movement. But he has struggled to build support among this constituency. A recent South Carolina poll showed he is the choice of fewer than 1 percent of black likely Democratic voters there. Ms. Harris held a morning breakfast event for black women in Atlanta. Though her candidacy has fallen from its once front-runner status, Ms. Harris made clear that she remains the only black woman in the race, and pitched herself as someone who can uniquely understand black communities. Ms. Harris said her criminal justice record was better than those of the race\u2019s white front-runners. \u201cThere are people on that debate stage who wrote the crime bill, who voted for the crime bill and who have not had the language to know what this is about until just the last couple years. Are you kidding me?\u201d Ms. Harris said. \u201cWhere were these folks when I was creating a national model around what we need to do to end mass incarceration and the war on drugs?\u201d At the debate, Mr. Biden touted his support among black voters, saying, \u201cI come out of the black community in terms of my support.\u201d But then he mistakenly said he had the endorsement of the \u201conly African-American woman that had ever been elected to the United States Senate.\u201d He was apparently referring to former Senator Carol Moseley Braun of Illinois \u2014 the first black woman to become a senator. He failed to mention Ms. Harris, the second black woman elected to the Senate, who was standing on the same stage.",

Biden Jr. and Senator Elizabeth Warren got into a direct confrontation late in the debate on Tuesday night as the pair of Democratic front-runners compared their achievements in office and traded barbs. Below is a transcript of part of the exchange: WARREN: So you started this question with how you got something done. You know, following the financial crash of 2008, I had an idea for a consumer agency that would keep giant banks from cheating people. And all of the Washington insiders and strategic geniuses said, don\u2019t even try because you will never get it passed. And sure enough, the big banks fought us. The Republicans fought us. Some of the Democrats fought us. But we got that agency passed into law. It has now forced big banks to return more than $12 billion directly to people they cheated. I served in the Obama administration. I know what we can do by executive authority, and I will use it. In Congress, on the first day, I will pass my anti-corruption bill, which will beat back the influence of money. ANDERSON COOPER: Thank you, Senator. WARREN: And repeal the filibuster. And the third, we want to get something done in America, we have to get out there and fight. COOPER: Thank you, Senator. WARREN: For the things that touch people\u2019s live. BIDEN: I agree. Let me \u2014 she referenced me. I agreed with the great job she did, and I went on the floor and got you votes. I got votes for that bill. I convinced people to vote for it, so let\u2019s get those things straight too. [Applause] COOPER: Senator Warren, do you want to respond? WARREN: I am deeply grateful to President Obama, who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law, and I am deeply grateful to every single person who fought for it and who helped pass it into law. But understand \u2014 BIDEN: You did a hell of a job in your job. WARREN: Thank you. (Applause) But understand this. It was a dream big, fight hard. People told me, go for something little. Go for something small. Go for something that the big corporations will be able to accept. COOPER: Thank you, senator. WARREN: I said, no. Let\u2019s go for an agency that will make structural change in our economy. And President Obama said, I will fight for that, and he sometimes had to fight against people in his own administration. We have \u2014 BIDEN: Not me. WARREN: Good. We have to be able to make big, structural change.",

      "author": "Nick Corasaniti",
      "content": " Senator Cory Booker, in an attempt to illustrate how some candidates were not campaigning with true attention to the black community, turned his criticism on Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. for saying he did not support legalizing marijuana. During the Democratic primary debate in Atlanta on Wednesday, he joked that Mr. Biden \u201cmight have been high\u201d when he said that. Below are transcripts of parts of the exchange: BOOKER: I want to turn back to this issue of black voters. I have a lifetime of experience with black voters. I\u2019ve been one since I was 18. Nobody on this stage should need a focus group to hear from African-American voters. Black voters are pissed off, and they\u2019re worried. They\u2019re pissed off because the only time our issues seem to be paid attention to by politicians is when people are looking for a vote. We don\u2019t want to see people miss this opportunity and lose because we are nominating someone that isn\u2019t trusted, doesn\u2019t have authentic connection. And so that\u2019s what\u2019s on the ballot. And issues do matter. I have a lot of respect for the vice president. He has sworn me into my office and he\u2019s a hero. This week I hear him literally say that \u201cI don\u2019t think we should legalize marijuana.\u201d I thought you might have been high when you said it. And let me tell you, because marijuana \u2014 marijuana in our country is already legal for privileged people. And it\u2019s \u2014 the war on drugs has been a war on black and brown people. So let me just say this, with more African-Americans under criminal supervision in America than all the slaves since 1850, do not roll up into communities and not talk directly to issues that are going to relate to the liberation of children. Because there are people in Congress right now that admit to smoking marijuana, while there are people \u2014 our kids are in jail right now for those drug crimes. So these are the kind of issues that mean a lot to our community, and we don\u2019t have somebody authentically, we\u2019ve lost the last election. Let me give you this data example. We lost in Wisconsin, a lot of reasons, but that was a massive diminution in the African-American vote. We need to have someone that can inspire, as Kamala said, to inspire African-Americans to the polls in record numbers. Mr. Biden responded that while he didn\u2019t fully support legalization, he did want reforms such as decriminalization: BIDEN: Number one, I think we should decriminalize marijuana, period, and anyone who has a record should be let out of jail, their record expunged, be completely zeroed out. But I do think it makes sense, based on data, that we should study what the long-term effects are for the use of marijuana. That\u2019s all it is. Number one, everybody gets out, record expunged. Mr. Booker, who has co-authored a bill to legalize marijuana, used the example to level a critique he has sometimes used in his stump speech: that the Democratic primary has occasionally focused disproportionately on the white working-class vote while taking the black vote for granted. He pointed to the black vote delta in Wisconsin as one of the critical reasons the state flipped from blue to red in 2016. A key part of Mr. Booker\u2019s campaign has been focusing on turning out the vote in cities like Milwaukee, Detroit and Philadelphia, even though those cities are not in key early states. After the third debate, Mr. Booker detoured from Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina to hold a rally in each city.",

      "author": "Trip Gabriel",
      "content": "  SCRANTON, Pa. \u2014 Joseph R. Biden Jr. returned to his native city on Wednesday seeking to undermine President Trump\u2019s strongest argument to voters for re-election: the resilient economy. He accused Mr. Trump of inheriting an economic upturn, but \u201cjust like everything else he inherited, he\u2019s in the midst of squandering it.\u201d Mr. Biden\u2019s speech was billed as an economic policy address, yet it was light on new plans; he repeated many ideas he has previously advanced. Instead, he made an emotional appeal rooted in his middle-class biography to restore the \u201cvalues\u201d of an American compact, in which hard work allowed average families to afford a home, higher education and health care. \u201cThere used to be a basic bargain in America: If you contribute to the well-being of the outfit you work with, you got to share in the benefits,\u201d Mr. Biden said, speaking to a few hundred in a downtown auditorium. \u201cThat bargain\u2019s been broken.\u201d Although corporate profits are up, Mr. Biden said, middle-class wages are stagnant and families are buckling under the burden of health bills and college. He promised to undo Republican tax cuts on corporations and the wealthy. The former vice president spoke in a region where in 2016 Democrats abandoned the party in droves for Mr. Trump\u2019s economic populism and nativism. Winning back at least a share of those voters in Scranton \u2014 and in dozens of \u201cScrantons\u201d across the northern industrial states \u2014 is most likely the key for Democrats in depriving Mr. Trump of a second term. Mr. Biden hit many of the same themes later in a lengthy speech he gave in West Point, Iowa, where he again talked about his family story and cast Mr. Trump as impervious to the needs of the middle class. He also took several veiled swipes at Senator Elizabeth Warren, who has said she will soon detail her plans to pay for \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d Mr. Biden supports building on the Affordable Care Act and adding a public option, but has suggested Medicare for all is unrealistic and too expensive. \u201cMy competitors are really well-meaning people,\u201d he said, but added: \u201cNone of them told you how Medicare for all is going to be paid for.\u201d After the event, Mr. Biden, in response to a question from a reporter, again expressed regret for his 1998 use of the term \u201cpartisan lynching\u201d in a discussion about impeachment proceedings against President Bill Clinton. Mr. Biden had also tweeted an apology on Tuesday for using the term. \u201cI was wrong to have said it and I apologize for having said it,\u201d Mr. Biden said on Wednesday. But he also criticized Mr. Trump for using the term \u201clynching,\u201d with its legacy of racist murders of African-Americans, to describe the impeachment inquiry he currently faces. Mr. Trump, he argued, was using the term \u201cas a dog whistle.\u201d \u201cWhen has he ever taken, when has he ever said a negative thing about a white supremacist?\u201d Mr. Biden said of the president. \u201cHave you heard him say anything? I haven\u2019t.\u201d Mr. Biden\u2019s appearance in Scranton came the same day that a new CNN national poll showed him with a commanding lead in the Democratic primary, with the support of 34 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning registered voters, followed by Ms. Warren at 19 percent and Senator Bernie Sanders at 16 percent. It is Mr. Biden\u2019s widest lead in the CNN survey since shortly after he announced his bid for president. But there is no national primary, of course, and Mr. Biden\u2019s advantage in the early-primary states Iowa and New Hampshire has ebbed or evaporated. The CNN survey is a sign that nationally he has retained strong support despite facing weeks of unproved attacks by Mr. Trump on him and his son Hunter over their activities in Ukraine, an issue driving the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry. Mr. Biden\u2019s economic prescriptions, less sweeping than those of other leading Democrats seeking the nomination, include a $15 federal minimum wage, tripling funding for schools with at-risk students, free community college and a plan for students to pay down their college debt by committing to community service. Pennsylvania\u2019s unemployment rate is only 3.9 percent, though it is 5.2 percent in Lackawanna County, where Scranton is. But a manufacturing downturn may be underway statewide, with 8,100 jobs lost this year so far, an issue that could cut into the president\u2019s 2016 promises to restore industry in the Rust Belt. While Mr. Biden visited Scranton, in northeast Pennsylvania, Mr. Trump was scheduled to be in Pittsburgh, in the western part of the state, on Wednesday afternoon, to address natural gas drillers. The president\u2019s visit comes close to the first anniversary of the Tree of Life Synagogue shooting in that city, when a gunman killed 11 worshipers. Though Democrats made strong gains in the 2018 midterms in Pennsylvania, it is very much up in the air whether they will carry the state next year, and who would be their most formidable opponent to the president. Mr. Trump has held rallies both before and after his election at an arena in nearby Wilkes-Barre that drew some 10,000 people. Although Hillary Clinton narrowly carried Lackawanna County, Mr. Trump cut deeply into the Democratic margin of more than 26,000 votes that Barack Obama piled up here in 2012. Democrats have been arguing ever since about how to recapture those voters, mostly white and working class, and how much to focus on them. Mr. Biden, who is regarded warmly by many Pennsylvanians thanks to his history here, spent many minutes recounting family stories he has told regularly: his father moving alone to Delaware for a job but promising to send for the family when he could afford to; his father feeling ashamed when a bank turned him down for a loan to pay for his son\u2019s college. His father telling young \u201cJoey\u201d that \u201cthe measure of success is not whether you get knocked down, it\u2019s how quickly you get up.\u201d The split-screen moment in Pennsylvania comes after weeks of clashes between the Trump and Biden camps. In the last month, Mr. Biden has faced concerns from some Democrats over whether he was responding quickly and aggressively enough to Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks. His campaign has settled on a strategy of frequently criticizing Mr. Trump and seeking to discredit his messages, while also focusing on policy matters \u2014 health care in particular. Jim Connors, a former Democratic mayor of Scranton, who attended Mr. Biden\u2019s speech, maintained that despite Mr. Trump\u2019s 2016 strength in the region, disillusionment has set in with some who voted for him. \u201cI think that Trump fooled the nation because his pitch was, I\u2019m going to kick their rear ends \u2014 the Mexicans, China and NATO, everybody, they\u2019ve all been taking advantage of us,\u201d Mr. Connors said. \u201cAnd he did nothing.\u201d",

      "content": " GREENWOOD, S.C. \u2014 Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and an immigrants\u2019 rights activist on Thursday engaged in an unusually extended clash over Obama-era deportation policies. For more than six minutes in a palpably tense gym here during a town hall-style event at Lander University, Mr. Biden sparred with the activist, Carlos Rojas, an organizer with the immigrants\u2019 rights group Movimiento Cosecha. The organization is urging presidential candidates to back a moratorium on deportations on their first day in office and has protested Mr. Biden before. \u201cYou should vote for Trump,\u201d Mr. Biden admonished Mr. Rojas during one of the most heated moments, after Mr. Rojas rattled off deportation figures under the Obama administration amid scattered cries of \u201cgive him the mic!\u201d \u201cYou should vote for Trump,\u201d Mr. Biden repeated. \u201cNo, no,\u201d Mr. Rojas said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to do that.\u201d Mr. Biden was not the only presidential candidate to face protesters Thursday evening. In Atlanta, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts was interrupted during a speech at Clark Atlanta University by a group of charter school activists. In South Carolina, Mr. Rojas began the exchange by translating for an immigrant named Silvia who raised concerns about the deportation numbers under former President Barack Obama. \u201cIf you were to be president, will you stop deportations on Day 1 through executive action?\u201d Mr. Rojas asked. \u201cNo,\u201d Mr. Biden responded. \u201cI will not stop all deportations. I will prioritize deportations only of people who have committed a felony or a serious crime, number one.\u201d He walked over to stand near Mr. Rojas and Silvia. \u201cNumber two,\u201d he continued, \u201cto compare President Obama to this guy is outrageous.\u201d The room applauded. Mr. Biden went on to defend the Obama administration\u2019s record on immigration, and said he would not discuss any areas of internal disagreement with Mr. Obama. And he repeatedly said he would not back a total moratorium on deportations, even as his remarks were punctuated several times by protesters who shouted, \u201cNot one more deportation.\u201d After Mr. Biden promised that there would not be family separations under his administration, someone shouted, \u201cThat\u2019s a lie!\u201d \u201cNo matter what happens, someone commits murder, they shouldn\u2019t be deported,\u201d Mr. Biden said, characterizing the protesters\u2019 position with an edge in his voice. By then, Mr. Rojas had left his seat and was standing next to Mr. Biden in the center of the room. \u201cNo, I\u2019m asking you a question,\u201d Mr. Biden added. The exchange finally ended as the protesters left the room and the rest of the audience applauded Mr. Biden. In several Democratic debates this year, Mr. Biden has faced criticism from his rivals over the Obama administration\u2019s deportation practices when Mr. Biden was serving as vice president. Mr. Biden, meanwhile, is a fierce critic of the hard-line immigration policies of the Trump administration, especially of family separation. Minutes after the immigrants\u2019 rights protesters left, he faced another interruption. \u201cI do not take money from corporations!\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cYou listen to Bernie too much.\u201d The clashes upended what had been an otherwise friendly town hall \u2014 but some voters afterward commended Mr. Biden\u2019s stewardship of the incident. Dan Healy, 70, said that he liked that Mr. Biden \u201csaid he wouldn\u2019t stop deportations for criminals.\u201d \u201cYeah, he didn\u2019t back down,\u201d Mr. Healy\u2019s wife, Lora Healy, 72, said. Ms. Warren was in the opening minutes of her speech, a major address on racial inequities, when she was disrupted. In an interview, an organizer of the protest, Dianechia Fields, 40, who is from Memphis, criticized Ms. Warren for pledging to cut funding for charter schools. Ms. Warren\u2019s education plan calls for ending federal funding for opening new charter schools and banning for-profit charters. Ms. Warren eventually received some assistance from Representative Ayanna S. Pressley of Massachusetts, who had introduced her at the event. Ms. Pressley came back onstage and urged the protesters to let Ms. Warren proceed with her speech, which highlighted the story of black washerwomen who went on strike in Atlanta in 1881. \u201cWe are grateful for your activism and your voice and you are welcome here, and we would love to convene after this about the issue that you are here to stoke our consciousness about,\u201d Ms. Pressley said. \u201cBut when these women have been ignored this long, this is their moment, and we are going to hear the story.\u201d",

New Polls Differ on Who\u2019s the Front-Runner in 2020 Race|October 25, 2019, Page A12",
      "author": "Matt Stevens",
      "content": "  Just over three months before Iowans caucus for Democratic presidential candidates, four polls out this week present a muddled picture of a primary race that is unfolding in varying, and sometimes conflicting, ways nationally and in early-voting states. A pair of new national polls present starkly different results. A CNN survey released Wednesday had former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. with a commanding lead of 15 percentage points ahead of Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. But a Quinnipiac University poll released Thursday had Ms. Warren as the front-runner, seven points ahead of Mr. Biden. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont finished a strong third in both national polls, suggesting that his standing in the race has not been diminished by his heart attack earlier this month \u2014 and that he may have been buoyed by endorsements from Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota. Two other polls from early-voting states show a tight race in Iowa and Mr. Biden maintaining a comfortable lead in South Carolina. Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., continued to show particular strength in Iowa, earning third place and 13 percent support in the Suffolk University/USA Today poll of Iowa Democrats released on Monday. Senator Kamala Harris of California, who is now staking her campaign on a top-three finish there, was in a four-way tie for fifth in that poll with 3 percent support. It is not clear why the CNN and Quinnipiac polls present such divergent results for Ms. Warren and Mr. Biden. But the polls, both considered to be of high quality and able to help candidates qualify for the next Democratic debate, add data points to a divide that has emerged in recent weeks: between surveys that show Mr. Biden with a commanding lead, and those that have him in a statistical dead heat with Ms. Warren. A number of things can affect a poll\u2019s results, including the wording of a horse-race question and the order that items are asked. In CNN and Fox News polls\u00a0this year, respondents have typically been asked for their opinions on each of the Democratic presidential candidates, among other questions, before being queried about their vote preference. In Quinnipiac\u2019s polls \u2014\u00a0as well as those conducted by Monmouth University, which have also shown Ms. Warren climbing steadily \u2014 people have not typically been asked to evaluate the candidates one-by-one before giving their vote choice. If such small differences in survey structure are indeed having an effect on results, it may reflect the fact that many respondents are not yet certain about their feelings. The CNN poll released this week brought that point home, finding that a majority of Democratic voters who favored one candidate \u2014 53 percent \u2014 said they could still change their mind about whom to support for the nomination. \u201cIt makes me think that voters are not settled, that they\u2019re still shopping for a candidate \u2014 that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing some movement between polls,\u201d Doug Schwartz, Quinnipiac\u2019s polling director, said Thursday in a telephone interview. The Quinnipiac poll also qualified Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota for the debate next month in Georgia, making her the ninth candidate to do so. Candidates must meet a donor requirement set by the Democratic National Committee as well as a polling requirement; Ms. Klobuchar, who is getting a second look after a strong performance in the October debate, received 3 percent support in the Quinnipiac survey and two others this week, giving her a total of four qualifying polls and securing her spot in the debate next month. National polls can offer a snapshot of the Democratic electorate\u2019s mood, and the extent to which a candidate\u2019s debate performance has helped or hurt a campaign. The Quinnipiac poll, which had a margin of error of five percentage points, said Ms. Warren had registered 28 percent support compared with 21 percent for Mr. Biden. Mr. Biden\u2019s support in the survey was down six points from a similar national poll that Quinnipiac released 10 days earlier and was conducted before the October debate; Ms. Warren\u2019s support was around the same in that poll. Support for Mr. Sanders rose slightly in the post-debate poll, to 15 percent, while Mr. Buttigieg remained in fourth place with 10 percent. The CNN poll, which had a margin of error of four percentage points, put Mr. Biden\u2019s support at 34 percent and Ms. Warren\u2019s at 19 percent. It seemed to add credibility to the results coming out of Fox News and other polling operations, which have consistently shown Mr. Biden alone at the front of the Democratic pack. Members of CNN\u2019s polling team declined to comment about the results of their latest survey. At the state level, the Suffolk University/USA Today poll of Iowa Democrats showed Mr. Biden in the lead with 18 percent support, Ms. Warren just behind him with 17 percent, Mr. Buttigieg next with 13 percent and Mr. Sanders finishing fourth with just 9 percent support. The outcome of Iowa voters\u2019 caucus in February could influence South Carolina voters, who go to the polls about four weeks later. Throughout the primary, Mr. Biden has held on to a steady and sizable lead in the polls there. The Monmouth University poll out of South Carolina this week showed his support there dipping to 33 percent this month from 39 percent in July, but Ms. Warren still finished a distant second with 16 percent support. Mark Blumenthal, an independent pollster who has advised Democratic candidates, pointed out that turnout in presidential primaries and caucuses is generally quite low \u2014 sometimes under 1 percent in some state contests. For this reason, the results of any survey that polls all registered Democratic voters nationwide is bound to capture many people who will not in fact participate. \u201cThe big challenge of polling in any election is measuring a population that doesn\u2019t yet exist,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. That is true of \u201cpresidential primaries in particular \u2014 because they\u2019re a small fraction of the larger population and because they\u2019re these very high-profile events where the composition can change dramatically from election to election.\u201d \u201cOdds are good,\u201d Mr. Blumenthal added, \u201cthese results will converge as we get closer to voting.\u201d",

      "content": " Sign up here to get On Politics in your inbox. When Senator Bernie Sanders attacked Joe Biden in April, shortly after the former vice president announced his presidential bid, Mr. Biden responded by \u2026 not responding at all. \u201cI\u2019m not going to get in a debate with my colleagues here,\u201d Mr. Biden told my colleague Jonathan Martin. That was when Mr. Biden held a commanding lead in early polling of the Democratic primary and Senator Elizabeth Warren was stuck in the single digits. My, how times have changed. On Wednesday, Mr. Biden questioned Ms. Warren\u2019s \u201ccredibility,\u201d comparing the Massachusetts senator, who has emerged as a force in the primary race, to President Trump. \u201cShe\u2019s going to have to tell the truth or the question will be raised about whether or not she\u2019s going to be candid and honest with the American people,\u201d he said. That attack came after a tense exchange during Tuesday night\u2019s debate, when Mr. Biden took some of the credit for Ms. Warren\u2019s signature achievement, the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau under Barack Obama\u2019s administration. \u201cI went on the floor and got you votes,\u201d he said, his voice rising. \u201cSo let\u2019s get those things straight, too.\u201d Ms. Warren parlayed the attack into a brutal response, thanking Mr. Obama and \u201cevery single person who fought\u201d for the agency, notably not naming Mr. Biden. Then, Mr. Biden seemed to try, again, to undermine the significance of her role. \u201cYou did a hell of a job in your job,\u201d he said, in a tone that struck some as condescending and paternalistic. A surprised Ms. Warren shrugged off the barb with a quick \u201cthank you,\u201d before pivoting back to the central message of her campaign: \u201cDream big, fight hard.\u201d Mr. Biden\u2019s more aggressive approach reflects his weakened standing in the race. In April, he was the definitive front-runner, running a type of Rose Garden, incumbent-light strategy that kept him above the fray. Now, dropping in the polls and lagging in money, he has to fight harder. But it also tells us something more about Mr. Biden\u2019s irritations with this moment in the campaign. He\u2019s frustrated: by the media, which he thinks is giving him a raw deal, and his opponents, who he believes are getting a free pass. Those resentments are manifesting in a dismissive tone and harsh attacks, at a time when aides to several other campaigns privately argue that Democrats do not want to see their candidates eviscerate one another. It\u2019s also a time when women are ascendant in the party \u2014 and at least a few Democratic voters saw sexism in Mr. Biden\u2019s tone. There are plenty of signs that Ms. Warren is beginning to face more scrutiny. She bore the brunt of the attacks on Tuesday night, facing jabs from seven of her rivals. Her refusal to say how she would pay for her \u201cMedicare for all\u201d health care plan feels untenable, risking undercutting the credentials of a candidate who has built her political brand on her policy chops. The question for Mr. Biden is whether his attacks encourage that scrutiny, or end up giving her more ammunition. We want to hear from our readers. Have a question? We\u2019ll try to answer it. Have a comment? We\u2019re all ears. Email us at onpolitics@nytimes.com. The Trump administration made a striking acknowledgment in Washington today: After President Trump had spent weeks arguing that there was no quid pro quo when he asked Ukraine to launch investigations into his political rivals, the acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, essentially confirmed that there was. He also insisted that it was standard operating procedure. In a briefing with reporters, Mr. Mulvaney acknowledged that the administration had held up military aid to Ukraine in part because of the president\u2019s request for that country to investigate a baseless theory about a missing Democratic National Committee server. \u201cI have news for everybody: Get over it,\u201d Mr. Mulvaney said. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be political influence in foreign policy.\u201d It was yet another example of Mr. Trump and his aides\u2019 admitting controversial \u2014 and possibly illegal \u2014 behavior out loud. Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s comments quickly became the new party line for the White House, echoed across the Capitol by other Trump supporters. \u201cWe have those types of expectations of our allies frequently,\u201d Representative Matt Gaetz, Republican of Florida, told reporters a few hours later. It\u2019s true, of course, that the United States bargains hard with foreign countries to further American interests \u2014 just not the president\u2019s personal interests. So why say that the Ukrainian foreign aid was conditioned on political investigations? Seems likely that it\u2019s because the evidence was increasingly moving in that direction. But it\u2019s also part of Mr. Trump\u2019s political strategy of blurting out publicly what he is accused of doing in secret. As my colleague Maggie Haberman puts it, saying the quiet part out loud removes some of the power of the secret and helps, as she puts it, \u201cmove the window of acceptability\u201d on damaging issues. My colleague Trip Gabriel sends this dispatch from Iowa: Representative Steve King of Iowa, the outspoken defender of \u201cWestern civilization\u201d and utterer of other incendiary statements, has caught a big break in his quest for a 10th term next year. Mr. King, who was stripped by fellow Republicans of his congressional committee assignments in January after he questioned why white supremacy is considered offensive, has drawn at least three Republican challengers. There\u2019s a good chance they will split the anti-King vote in next year\u2019s primary, allowing the incumbent to slide through to run again in Iowa\u2019s most conservative district. Abandoned by his party\u2019s establishment, Mr. King raised just $61,800 over the summer and has just $40,600 on hand, according to fund-raising data reported this week. He pulled in just $3,020 from conservative PACs. Two Republican challengers, Randy Feenstra, a state senator, and Bret Richards, a retired businessman, have raised more money than the incumbent. The Democratic challenger, J. D. Scholten, who came close to unseating Mr. King in 2018, raised $415,000 in the two months after announcing he would run again. But money has never mattered to Mr. King in previous races: He has universal name identification and is embraced by a sizable part of the Republican base in his district. He will also benefit from the decision by Iowa\u2019s top Republicans, Gov. Kim Reynolds and Senators Charles E. Grassley and Joni Ernst, to stay neutral ahead of the June primary. All had condemned Mr. King after his remark on white supremacy appeared in a New York Times article. (Mr. King has claimed he was misquoted.) Laura Belin, a liberal blogger in Iowa who closely monitors Mr. King, noted that he was well received in town halls this year and is cleaving to supporters by portraying himself as a victim of the media and an ardent defender of President Trump under impeachment fire. Mr. Scholten, a former professional baseball player, faces an uphill battle in a district where registered Republicans strongly outnumber Democrats. DEAR SANTA: DON\u2019T BE A FOOL!

      "content": " WEST POINT, Iowa \u2014 Joseph R. Biden Jr. was making an impassioned case for protecting undocumented immigrants one recent Sunday when he abruptly stopped himself. \u201cThere\u2019s many more things, but \u2014\u201d he said before trailing off. Minutes later, Mr. Biden interrupted himself again. \u201cSo there\u2019s a, there\u2019s \u2014 my time up?\u201d he said, echoing a line he had used when he stumbled in the first presidential debate this year. \u201cI guess not. I guess it is.\u201d And as he spoke to reporters here last week about President Trump\u2019s freezing of military aid to Ukraine, he briefly fumbled his words. \u201cPeople are being killed in western, in eastern Afghan \u2014 excuse me, in eastern, uh, Ukraine,\u201d he said. Six months into his presidential campaign, Mr. Biden is still delivering uneven performances on the debate stage and on the campaign trail in ways that can undermine his message. He takes circuitous routes to the ends of sentences, if he finishes them at all. He sometimes says the opposite of what he means (\u201cI would eliminate the capital gains tax \u2014 I would raise the capital gains tax\u201d he said in this month\u2019s debate). He has mixed up countries, cities and dates, embarked on off-message asides and sometimes he simply cuts himself off. That choppy speaking style puts Mr. Biden at a disadvantage as his front-runner status erodes and he confronts growing pressure to expand his appeal with voters and donors. He faces intensifying competition for moderate support, a formidable liberal foe in Elizabeth Warren, attacks on his family by Mr. Trump and Republicans, and a troubling cash crunch. At a time when he most needs to convey confidence and forcefulness, some Democrats say, he is instead getting in his own way. \u201cHe does not do well speaking where he isn\u2019t giving a speech,\u201d said Chris Henning, the Democratic chair in Greene County, Iowa, who caucused for Mr. Biden when he ran for president in 2008. \u201cHe\u2019s not good in debates and he comes across like he\u2019s stumbling around, trying to figure out what he\u2019s going to say.\u201d Mr. Biden\u2019s verbal miscues have long led to challenges. He was forced to withdraw from the 1988 presidential campaign after he presented biographical details from the life of the British Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock as his own. His gaffe-prone tendencies made national headlines during his 2008 presidential bid when he referred to Barack Obama as \u201cthe first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean.\u201d But Mr. Biden can now appear less crisp, and more hesitant, than in the past \u2014 and also in comparison to more polished rivals in the crowded Democratic primary. As the early leader in 2020 polls he has spent more time in the national spotlight, and he is competing in a fast-moving social media environment in which gaffes are magnified and candidates are rewarded for being quick on their feet. Mr. Biden, 76, still leads many national polls, and he enjoys significant good will from many Democratic voters. Some attendees at his events in Iowa last week said Mr. Biden, who overcame a childhood stutter, is a relatable raconteur whose decades of experience are comforting amid the chaos of the Trump era. He can be forceful in denouncing the president from the podium, and is at his best in individual conversations with voters. And of course, if Mr. Biden wins the nomination, he will face a president who is an undisciplined speaker in his own right \u2014 one who misstated the name of his own cabinet secretary recently, tortures grammar and spelling in his tweets and, most significantly, routinely makes false claims about matters large and small. But Mr. Biden\u2019s inconsistent performances illustrate why many Democrats remain skeptical of his candidacy: Whatever his strengths in polls \u2014 and the data is mixed, especially in the early-voting primary states \u2014 on the ground his performances are often plainly shaky. Nowhere are the stakes higher for Mr. Biden than in Iowa, the leadoff caucus state where Mr. Biden will return for a four-day swing on Wednesday. Ms. Warren has tied or moved ahead of Mr. Biden in some polls, and party officials on the ground say Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., appears capable of siphoning some of Mr. Biden\u2019s centrist support. Senator Amy Klobuchar, a moderate from neighboring Minnesota, also gained attention after the October debate. Last week, she qualified for the fifth debate, scheduled for next month. While Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign has publicly sought to downplay expectations in Iowa, it has also invested heavily in both time and resources. In a confidential memo circulated last week, the campaign manager, Greg Schultz, said that Mr. Biden was positioned to have a \u201cnarrow advantage\u201d in the state. \u201cI plan on winning Iowa. I\u2019m working like hell to win Iowa,\u201d Mr. Biden told reporters here, adding, \u201cIt could end up being a must-win; it could not make a difference.\u201d In Iowa and nationally, worries about Mr. Biden\u2019s speaking style are often intertwined with concerns about his age \u2014 though his allies and former staffers say he has long been prone to misspeaking. Mr. Biden has said it is fair to raise his age, and in one of his stronger moments at the last debate, said that \u201cwith it comes wisdom.\u201d In a statement over the summer, his doctor said that he was in \u201cexcellent physical condition.\u201d But several public appearances have intensified questions about his ability to connect in this political moment. At the September debate, Mr. Biden responded to a question about the legacy of slavery with a rambling answer that included advising the use of a record player to expose underprivileged children to more words. At a CNN forum focused on L.G.B.T.Q. issues this month, Mr. Biden \u2014 who was ahead of Mr. Obama in voicing support for same-sex marriage \u2014 still raised eyebrows for referencing \u201cgay bath houses,\u201d while making a broader point about evolving attitudes. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t necessarily bother me,\u201d said Steve Drahozal, the Democratic chairman in Dubuque County, Iowa, of Mr. Biden\u2019s \u201chalting speaking style,\u201d allowing that Mr. Biden might simply be thoughtful. \u201cBut there are a lot of voters out there who want to be inspired by a candidate. Democrats win when we have an inspiring candidate.\u201d Concerns about Mr. Biden\u2019s style aren\u2019t confined to members of the political class: Voters often raise the issue, including at his own events. \u201cI like Joe, but I don\u2019t think Joe\u2019s going to get it because he has not been doing very well with his speaking, with the debates,\u201d said Lisa Kane, 62, of Keokuk, Iowa, as she waited for Mr. Biden to speak. \u201cPete would do a better job. He\u2019s younger, a great speaker, he\u2019s smart, got the military background.\u201d Debbie Hunter, who stood with Ms. Kane, based her assessment on Mr. Biden\u2019s debate performances, which many Democrats continue to see as lackluster at best. \u201cHe\u2019s real hard to follow,\u201d Ms. Hunter, 57, said. \u201cI have a lot of concern about his ability to concentrate, his attention span, the ability to get the job done.\u201d But Patty Madden, 69, and Bev Alderson, 60, two former teachers, said Mr. Biden\u2019s informal, story-laden speaking style was part of his charm. \u201cI love it,\u201d Ms. Alderson said. \u201cIt appeals to the common people, working class, Americans, everybody!\u201d \u201cI know he falls over some of his words, we all do,\u201d Ms. Madden said. \u201cOh, big deal!\u201d Ms. Alderson interjected. \u201cHe speaks from his heart.\u201d At his two events in Iowa last Wednesday, Mr. Biden spoke, relatively carefully, from teleprompters. There were some apparent tangents \u2014 one promise to wrap up his address drifted into a digression on illness in China \u2014 but he also ended with a forceful conclusion about America\u2019s strengths and received a standing ovation. Mr. Biden has also proven capable of speaking crisply and movingly, and he was a fierce competitor at the vice-presidential debate in 2012. This year, too, he has had some electric moments, such as when he eviscerated Mr. Trump for fanning \u201cthe flames of white supremacy.\u201d And he can be sharper in exchanges with reporters than he is on a debate stage. \u201cHis day after debate press conference have been outstanding,\u201d Jim Messina, Mr. Obama\u2019s 2012 campaign manager, wrote in an email. \u201cHe shines in that format, as he did in 2012. It also shows he still had a fastball. The mass format debates just aren\u2019t his strong suit. And that\u2019s probably O.K. The field is beginning to narrow. He still has time.\u201d Some advisers and allies have said privately that they have little control over Mr. Biden\u2019s speaking style, but they also insist his debate performances have improved, and note that a string of controversies and wobbly public appearances have hardly crushed his campaign. \u201cNot one expert has been right about Joe Biden,\u201d said former Senator Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat and friend of Mr. Biden\u2019s. \u201cIt goes on and on. \u2018He can\u2019t make it, it\u2019s just the name ID.\u2019 Then he\u2019s going to fall out because he\u2019s too affectionate. Now he\u2019s going to fall down because he\u2019s too gaffe prone? Now it\u2019s the money? I just don\u2019t buy it.\u201d In response to multiple questions for this article, a Biden campaign spokesman, Jamal Brown, pointed to steady poll numbers in head-to-head matchups with Mr. Trump, and to surveys that show him growing his support among Democratic voters. Ms. Hunter, of Keokuk, said seeing Mr. Biden in person allayed some of her concerns and that she had moved him in her candidate rankings. \u201cIf he wants to win these debates, he needs to speak up, get fired up,\u201d she said. Asked if he had done so in the event at West Point, she replied, \u201cWell, a little. At the end.\u201d",

      "content": "  When Russia invaded Ukraine in early 2014, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. pressed President Barack Obama to take decisive action, and fast, to make Moscow \u201cpay in blood and money\u201d for its aggression. The president, a Biden aide recalled, was having none of it. Mr. Biden worked Mr. Obama during their weekly private lunches, imploring him to increase lethal aid, backing a push to ship FGM-148 Javelin anti-tank missiles to Kiev. The president flatly rejected the idea and dispatched him to the region as an emissary, cautioning him \u201cabout not overpromising to the Ukrainian government,\u201d Mr. Biden would later write in a memoir. [Trump, Ukraine and impeachment: The inside story of how we got here.] So, Mr. Biden threw himself into what seemed like standard-issue vice-presidential stuff: prodding Ukraine\u2019s leaders to tackle the rampant corruption that made their country a risky bet for international lenders \u2014 and pushing reform of Ukraine\u2019s cronyism-ridden energy industry. \u201cYou have to be whiter than snow, or the whole world will abandon you,\u201d Mr. Biden told the country\u2019s newly elected president, Petro O. Poroshenko, during an early 2014 phone call, according to former administration officials. That message was delivered just as Mr. Biden\u2019s son Hunter joined the board of a Ukrainian gas company that was the subject of multiple corruption investigations, a position that paid him as much as $50,000 a month and \u2014 in the view of some administration officials, including the ambassador to Kiev \u2014 threatened to undermine Mr. Biden\u2019s agenda. Thanks to President Trump and his lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani, that subplot has now swallowed the story line. Their efforts to press Ukrainian officials to investigate unsubstantiated charges against the Bidens have propelled Mr. Trump to the brink of impeachment. They have also put Mr. Biden on the defensive at a critical moment in the Democratic presidential primary campaign. As the impeachment hearings go public this week, the Republicans are hoping to redirect the spotlight onto the Bidens. A look at what the former vice president actually did in Ukraine (he visited six times and spent hours on the phone with the country\u2019s leaders) tells a different story, according to interviews with more than two dozen people knowledgeable about the situation. It casts light on one of Mr. Biden\u2019s central arguments for himself in the primary: his eight years of diplomacy as Mr. Obama\u2019s No. 2. Mr. Biden dived into Ukraine in hopes of burnishing his statesman credentials at a time when he seemed to be winding down his political career, as his elder son, Beau, was dying and his younger one, Hunter, was struggling with addiction and financial problems. It turned out to be an unforgiving landscape \u2014 threatened by Russia, plundered by oligarchs, plagued by indecisive leaders and overrun by outsiders hoping to make a quick buck off the chaos. Writing in his 2017 memoir, Mr. Biden said Ukraine gave him a chance to fulfill a childhood promise to make a difference in the world. It also came to serve a political purpose, as \u201ca legacy project, something he could run on,\u201d said Keith Darden, an associate professor at American University who studies Ukraine policy. In the end, it was an unglamorous holding action, but one that suited Mr. Biden\u2019s Mr. Fix-It approach to the vice presidency \u2014 and his view of Ukraine as the front line in a larger battle to contain the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin. \u201cPeople forget it now, but at that time period, 2014 and 2015, it wasn\u2019t clear Ukraine would survive,\u201d Mr. Darden said. \u201cThey were teetering on the brink of bankruptcy. They had only 8,000 battle-ready troops.\u201d A key to Mr. Biden\u2019s relevance as vice president was his willingness to take jobs nobody else wanted. In early 2014, as others on Mr. Obama\u2019s team raced to finish big-splash deals with Cuba and Iran, Mr. Biden told the president he wanted to take on three of the most unappetizing foreign-policy tasks left undone: containing the Islamic State, curbing immigration from Central America and keeping Russia from devouring Ukraine. Mr. Biden had deep contacts in Europe, and as a senator in the 1990s had had some success persuading President Bill Clinton to take action in the Balkans. He considered himself to be among the few people in Mr. Obama\u2019s orbit who understood Europe and were willing to challenge Mr. Putin \u2014 a counter to the national security adviser, Susan E. Rice, who repeatedly warned the president against escalating a conflict with Russia that the United States could not win. Yet on Ukraine, as elsewhere, Mr. Biden was less an architect of policy than the empowered executor of Mr. Obama\u2019s policy. \u201cHe was the vice president, not the president,\u201d said Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire, part of a bipartisan group of lawmakers allied with Mr. Biden who pressured Mr. Obama to help Ukraine\u2019s military. Indeed, the drive to provide lethal aid to Kiev was a group effort, pushed by senators and two powerful State Department officials: Geoffrey R. Pyatt, who was the ambassador in Kiev, and Victoria J. Nuland, then the hawkish assistant secretary for European and Eurasian affairs. Ms. Nuland was overheard telling Mr. Pyatt they needed Mr. Biden \u201cfor an attaboy\u201d to encourage Ukrainian leaders to fulfill their promises, during a 2013 phone conversation about Ukraine, bugged and released to the media. Mr. Biden applied his Amtrak charm to local players like Ukraine\u2019s embattled president, Viktor Yanukovych, with limited effect. Former White House aides recall watching an agitated Mr. Biden ducking in and out of a secure phone booth outside the situation room in early 2014, trying to reach Mr. Yanukovych on his cellphone. \u201cWhere the hell is this guy?\u201d he kept asking, before learning that Mr. Yanukovych had fled Kiev, ultimately for Russia, as huge street protests erupted against his regime\u2019s corruption and his pivot away from Europe and toward Moscow. Mr. Putin then rushed in, annexing Crimea and backing paramilitaries who invaded the country\u2019s east. While Mr. Biden\u2019s pitch for missiles was rebuffed, he eventually helped sell Mr. Obama on sending about 100 American service members to train Ukraine\u2019s security forces. Things seemed to be looking up in May 2014 with the election of Mr. Poroshenko, an oligarch who billed himself as a reformer. At first, the vice president\u2019s hard-edged messages to him on corruption were coated with kibbitz \u2014 demands accompanied by Bidenesque inquiries like whether the puffy-eyed president was getting enough sleep, aides recalled. Within months, though, the State Department began suspecting that the office of Mr. Poroshenko\u2019s first prosecutor general was accepting bribes to protect Mykola Zlochevsky, the oligarch owner of Burisma Holdings, the gas company where Hunter Biden was a board member. In a February 2015 meeting in Kiev with a deputy prosecutor, a State Department official named George P. Kent demanded to know \u201cwho took the bribe and how much was it?\u201d The prosecutor general was fired soon after. But it wasn\u2019t long before the new prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, was drawing allegations of corruption, including from State Department officials who suspected he was shaking down targets and intentionally slow-walking investigations to protect allies. Mr. Giuliani has claimed, without evidence, that Mr. Biden\u2019s push to oust Mr. Shokin was an attempt to block scrutiny of his son\u2019s actions. In fact, Mr. Biden was just one of many officials calling for Mr. Shokin to go. Good-government activists were protesting his actions in the streets, as were eurozone power players like Christine Lagarde, then the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, along with Ms. Nuland and Senate Republicans. \u201cThe position regarding getting rid of Shokin was not Vice President Biden\u2019s position; it was the position of the U.S. government, as well as the European Union and international financial institutions,\u201d said Amos J. Hochstein, former coordinator for international energy affairs at the State Department and one of the few administration officials who directly confronted Mr. Biden at the time about his son. Ukraine\u2019s energy industry, the country\u2019s geopolitically crucial economic engine, was a central point of contention between the Obama administration and Kiev. Mr. Biden and Mr. Hochstein, echoing a similar effort by European officials, pressured Mr. Poroshenko to reform the operations of the state-owned natural gas company Naftogaz, which controlled about two-thirds of the country\u2019s energy resources. (Burisma, a smaller, privately owned company, played no role in Mr. Biden\u2019s pressure campaign, and administration officials could not recall whether the company was even mentioned in meetings the vice president attended on energy matters.) By late 2015, American officials had grown so frustrated with Mr. Poroshenko\u2019s sluggish response on all fronts that Mr. Biden was dispatched to make the case publicly for reforms to the Ukrainian Parliament. That December, in a speech that he later described as one of the most important he had ever delivered, the vice president told legislators they had \u201cto remove all conflicts between their business interest and their government responsibilities.\u201d He also singled out the natural gas industry, saying, \u201cThe energy sector needs to be competitive, ruled by market principles \u2014 not sweetheart deals.\u201d His words, like his work in Ukraine over all, were important but hardly decisive. \u201cA lot of good things would not have happened if Biden hadn\u2019t been focused on Ukraine, but his work did not fundamentally change the overall institutional corruption,\u201d said Edward C. Chow, an expert on geopolitics and energy policy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a nonpartisan Washington think tank. \u201cAnd having his son doing what he did was a distraction that undermined his message.\u201d Mr. Shokin was eventually fired, but only months later, after I.M.F. officials threatened to withdraw funding. In the intervening years, there has been much churn and less change. Mr. Putin, facing sanctions, has mostly stayed in check. Mr. Poroshenko was beaten at the polls by Volodymyr Zelensky in April, and remains bitter toward Mr. Biden for calling him out over his handling of Naftogaz during a meeting shortly before the 2016 elections, according to a person to whom he recently complained. Some reforms have been put in place at the energy giant: Ukrainian officials agreed to appoint an international oversight board (Mr. Hochstein is now a paid I.M.F. appointee to the panel), but the issue of sweetheart deals remains unresolved. The battle over Naftogaz has also become wrapped up in the House impeachment inquiry. Two of Mr. Giuliani\u2019s associates in his pressure campaign against the Bidens \u2014 Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman \u2014 were part of an effort to remove Mr. Pyatt\u2019s successor as ambassador to Kiev, Marie L. Yovanovitch, who had called for reforms to the energy giant. For his part, Hunter Biden remained on Burisma\u2019s board until his term expired in April. It was Mr. Trump, ironically, who signed off on Mr. Biden\u2019s request to send the Javelins. Mr. Biden wants to move on. \u201cI carried out the policy of the United States government,\u201d he said during the most recent Democratic debate. \u201cThat\u2019s what we should be focusing on.\u201d But he did not take advantage of a chance to eliminate the distraction four years ago, when the threat resurfaced \u2014 in the form of questions from The New York Times and follow-ups from other news organizations \u2014 as he flew to Kiev on Air Force Two to deliver the anti-corruption speech to Parliament. Several aides recalled a surreal split-screen of activity onboard, as Mr. Biden\u2019s team focused mostly on the speech (he urged them to make it tougher), but peeled off for intermittent huddles on how to handle the Hunter story (Mr. Biden dismissed the story as a distraction, and did not engage). The group defaulted to the pushback plan used the year before when the story had first emerged, issuing a statement that Hunter Biden was \u201ca private citizen and a lawyer.\u201d They emphasized \u201cprivate citizen,\u201d many former aides said, because the vice president would not even discuss taking the step that could make all questions vanish: asking his son to quit the Burisma board, as editorial boards and Ukraine experts were suggesting. Mr. Biden\u2019s advisers say that he and his son had informally agreed years earlier not to discuss anything pertaining to the younger Mr. Biden\u2019s business activities, as a way to insulate them both. Bob Bauer, former Obama White House counsel and Biden adviser, said that even pressuring Hunter Biden to quit the board would have constituted a breach of that firewall, and suggested that was one of the reasons the vice president chose not to do it. \u201cThe independent activities of an adult child simply don\u2019t create a \u2018conflict of interest\u2019 for the parent who is a public official,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd as a matter of sound ethical practice, it is important for officials in this position to maintain that distance: to be able to show that, in doing their jobs, they could not have been affected by discussions or involvement with their adult children relating to private business matters. Their posture has to be, \u2018Whatever you decide to do, I am going to do what I have to do.\u2019\u201d Mr. Biden has said he first learned of his son\u2019s activities in Ukraine when the story broke in 2014. He told his son, \u201cI hope you know what you are doing,\u201d according to Hunter Biden\u2019s account of their discussion in The New Yorker earlier this year. If that settled matters between father and son, Hunter Biden\u2019s activities struck many of the officials working on Ukraine policy as an unnecessary distraction, or worse. Mr. Biden\u2019s own aides were so worried about the optics, they enlisted State Department officials to gather facts to determine how to handle the story, according to people who worked with his office. Yet few, if any, had raised the issue with Mr. Biden directly when it first arose. Most viewed the revelation \u2014 unseemly, but not illegal or a violation of ethics rules \u2014 as simply not worth risking a scolding from Mr. Biden, who had reacted angrily when Mr. Obama\u2019s aides raised the issue of his son\u2019s lobbying during the 2008 campaign. One person who briefly discussed the matter with Mr. Biden said he was anguished by his son\u2019s personal problems and unsure how to help him recover. Mr. Hochstein, reflecting the concerns of State Department officials, including Mr. Pyatt, tried to get several of Mr. Biden\u2019s aides to broach the subject with him in 2014. When they declined, he took matters into his own hands, according to three Obama administration officials with knowledge of the situation. It is not clear how Mr. Biden responded; Mr. Hochstein did not disclose details of their interaction. But former administration officials involved in the response to the story, speaking on the condition of anonymity, cited one reason above all others for backing off: the vice president\u2019s shaky emotional state over Beau\u2019s illness and death. Mr. Kent, now the deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, told House investigators that his concerns had not been addressed by a White House official, who told him that Mr. Biden lacked the \u201cfurther bandwidth to deal with family-related issues at that time.\u201d Mr. Biden\u2019s mood in 2019 is no longer grief but anger. His aides accuse the news media of abetting Mr. Trump by aiming the story, now the catalyst for impeachment, back at the former vice president. \u201cLet\u2019s not forget that this was covered on A22 of The Times in 2015, because it did not fall outside the White House\u2019s ethical guidelines and was simply not a major story,\u201d said Kate Bedingfield, the Biden campaign\u2019s communications director. She added: \u201cWhat\u2019s different now? It\u2019s that Donald Trump is aggressively lying about it every day in the hopes that it winds up on the front page.\u201d",

Biden Jr. has durable support from a multiracial coalition of working-class voters who view him as one of their own.By Katie Glueck and Jonathan MartinPRINT EDITIONWorking-Class Voters Are Sticking by \u2018Common Joe\u2019|November 20, 2019, Page A11",

      "content": "  WEST POINT, Iowa \u2014 They are white and nonwhite alike, prefer Facebook over Twitter, if they are on social media at all, and can be hard to find at Democratic campaign events dominated by activists from the professional class. But these blue-collar voters could go a long way toward determining who captures the Democratic presidential nomination \u2014 and Joseph R. Biden Jr. is racing to press his advantage with that constituency. With less than three months to go before voting begins in the 2020 primary, and on the eve of the fifth presidential primary debate, Mr. Biden faces significant challenges in the key early states of Iowa and New Hampshire, a cash crunch and several Democrats threatening his standing with centrist voters. But his greatest compensating advantage right now is notably durable support from a multiracial coalition of working-class voters who feel a kinship with the former vice president and believe he is the Democrats\u2019 strongest general election prospect. At fund-raisers and on campaign stops, Mr. Biden is warning his party against overlooking voters who were once a core Democratic constituency but had found some elements of President Trump\u2019s message compelling in 2016. His campaign believes the Democratic Party risks narrowing its Electoral College path in 2020, and hurting its standing on Capitol Hill, if candidates do not appeal directly to these more moderate voters in battleground states in the Midwest and Sun Belt. And both explicitly and more subtly, Mr. Biden is portraying his chief rival, Senator Elizabeth Warren, and another top candidate, Senator Bernie Sanders, as liberals who are overly focused on expensive and theoretical government overhauls. \u201cGrowing up in a middle-class neighborhood, the last thing I liked is people telling my family and me what we should know, what we should believe,\u201d Mr. Biden said as he criticized Ms. Warren\u2019s advocacy style, speaking at a recent CNN town hall in Iowa. \u201cAs if somehow we weren\u2019t informed, that we \u2014 just because we didn\u2019t have money we weren\u2019t knowledgeable. I resent that.\u201d Ms. Warren, who is running as a corruption-battling economic populist, surpassed Mr. Biden in a number of polls this fall, and she is often the favorite of white, college-educated voters \u2014 but Mr. Biden still leads comfortably with high school-educated Democrats in many surveys. That dynamic has stymied Ms. Warren\u2019s growth after her early-autumn surge, and it has sometimes benefited Mr. Sanders, who also has strong connections to blue-collar voters. In dozens of interviews, from parades and union rallies to black churches and political picnics, working-class Democrats who support Mr. Biden explained their views in practical terms: they know and trust the Scranton native from his long tenure as a Delaware senator and as Barack Obama\u2019s vice president, they find his incremental policy proposals realistic and they think he can win. \u201cI liked what him and Barack did together,\u201d said Doris Stuekerjuergen, who worked at a fireplace factory and attended an October event with Mr. Biden in this small rural community of West Point. \u201cHopefully he leads us back to where we were. The world we live in now is pretty scary.\u201d The Democrat who forges a cross-racial coalition of working-class voters almost always wins the party\u2019s presidential nomination. It is a path that was disrupted only in 2008 when Mr. Obama was able to achieve what few of his predecessors had \u2014 fuse the support of upscale whites with black Democrats. But surveys in this race indicate a return to the longstanding tradition in Democratic primaries of voters splitting along class lines, and illuminate a key slice of Mr. Biden\u2019s base. A recent New York Times/Siena College poll of Democratic primary voters in general election battleground states found that among white voters without a four-year degree, Mr. Biden had double the support \u2014 30 percent \u2014 of Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders. But the numbers for Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren were nearly reversed among white college graduates. In Iowa, where Mr. Biden is struggling, he was still the strong favorite of voters who did not go past high school in another recent New York Times/Siena College poll of likely Democratic caucusgoers. And in South Carolina, where the Democratic electorate is dominated by black voters and where Mr. Biden is strong across the board, a Monmouth University poll from late last month showed him receiving the support of 38 percent of voters without college degrees, well ahead of his rivals. \u201cHe is the only candidate right now that I feel can beat Trump,\u201d said Ivie Barnwell, who stood in the shade selling her handmade sweetgrass baskets in Galivants Ferry, S.C. Around her, T-shirt-clad activists and a host of presidential candidates descended on the town for a political festival earlier this fall. \u201cThis Trump man has got to go,\u201d she said. For some voters, Mr. Biden appeals because there are strategic assumptions at work: many black working-class Democrats believe that white America will only support a well-known white male, such as Mr. Biden, while a number of working-class white Democrats also believe he is the most acceptable nominee. Some voters cited the misogyny and racism that female candidates and candidates of color have experienced in previous races. And then there is the crucial fact that many of these voters \u2014 whether because of his down-to-earth persona, the tragedies he has endured or a combination of both \u2014 simply have warm feelings for the man they often address as Joe when they see him. \u201cHe relates well to blue-collar voters and to non-college voters,\u201d Jeff Link, a veteran Iowa Democratic strategist, said. \u201cThose Scranton roots kind of come through.\u201d Despite this advantage, some Democrats are skeptical that Mr. Biden, who turns 77 on Wednesday, can sustain this support. Since he entered the race in April, Mr. Biden\u2019s poll numbers have dipped, he has suffered from a series of self-inflicted errors that raised concerns about his age, and he has absorbed ferocious attacks from Democrats and Republicans alike \u2014 including baseless attacks on his family from Mr. Trump. Ty Livesay, the operations manager at a mall in Conway, S.C., said he connected with Mr. Biden \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m a common Joe, he\u2019s a common Joe\u201d \u2014 but acknowledged having doubts about Mr. Biden\u2019s strength in the primary. \u201cIs Joe going to be able to handle it?\u201d he asked. Others harbor no such reservations. \u201cI don\u2019t care about his personal opinion, gaffes or comments he makes \u2014 what means most to me is what type of man he is,\u201d said Pete Garrett, who works at an auto parts production company and wore an Obama campaign pin to a Biden appearance in Birmingham, Ala. For all of his advantages with blue-collar voters in the Democratic primary, Mr. Biden so far does not appear to significantly cut into Mr. Trump\u2019s base of white working-class voters. And he is not the only Democratic candidate perceived as electable. Early polls, which are parsed by some committed voters but are not predictive at this stage, show several Democrats beating Mr. Trump in head-to-head matchups. Still, Mr. Biden\u2019s rivals recognize the advantage he has built up with blue-collar voters and are seeking their own inroads with them. Even as she has unveiled a lengthy roster of detailed policy plans that thrill college-educated liberals, Ms. Warren, for example, also highlights her modest Oklahoma roots, her brothers\u2019 military service and her own time as a teacher. Mr. Sanders also enjoys a blue-collar following, polls show. While the most politically muscular element of the Democratic working-class \u2014 the labor unions \u2014 has largely remained on the sideline, after feeling regret over their early intervention on behalf of Hillary Clinton in 2016, Mr. Sanders has recently notched some endorsements. They include the country\u2019s biggest nurses\u2019 union and a teachers\u2019 union in Los Angeles. Senator Kamala Harris, who is struggling in the polls, was endorsed by the United Farm Workers. Mr. Sanders in particular is sitting on voters Mr. Biden could use, especially if Ms. Warren continues to make gains with college-educated Democrats \u2014 though she increasingly faces competition for those voters from Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. One union that does support Mr. Biden is the International Association of Fire Fighters. And that union\u2019s president, Harold Schaitberger, said Democrats should be wary of again losing some of the voters who sided with Mr. Trump in 2016. Mr. Schaitberger said these voters want to feel \u201cthat they are connected with someone who wants to be president of the United States but isn\u2019t, if you will, looking down on them or preaching down to them.\u201d Asked whether he meant those remarks as a swipe at any of Mr. Biden\u2019s opponents, Mr. Schaitberger, himself a high-school educated voter, demurred. But he noted that \u201cthere are some candidates that, you know, speak in a very high intellectual, professorial\u201d fashion. Ms. Warren is a former Harvard professor. Mr. Biden has also scolded Democrats over their drift from bread-and-butter issues like wages, pensions and union rights. \u201cI bet some of you voted for Donald Trump because we stopped talking to you,\u201d he said at a campaign stop in Newton, Iowa, over the summer, adding, \u201cWe sort of stopped talking to our base: high school-educated Americans.\u201d Mr. Biden\u2019s research has indicated that such voters respond particularly well when reminded of Mr. Biden\u2019s middle-class youth as a car dealer\u2019s son and that he had lost his first wife and daughter in a car accident and his elder son to brain cancer. He made his biography central to his initial advertising, linking his support for the Affordable Care Act to his searing family story. Steve Buchmeier, a 54-year-old farmer from Kellogg, Iowa, has seen Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign ads, and he was one of the Obama-Trump voters in attendance at Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign stop in Newton. \u201cThe U.S. isn\u2019t ready for a girl,\u201d he said as he reflected on the 2016 election, stressing that his own decisions are not influenced by gender. This time around, Mr. Buchmeier said, he found Mr. Biden\u2019s experience as vice president impressive, though he was not committed to switching back to the Democrats in 2020. But, he said, \u201cthis guy is on the top of my list if I do.\u201d",

      "author": "Trip Gabriel",
      "content": " SOUTH BEND, Ind. \u2014 An African-American official of South Bend, Ind., endorsed Joseph R. Biden Jr. for president on Friday, snubbing the city\u2019s mayor, Pete Buttigieg, in a close-to-home example of Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s struggle to attract black support. The official, Oliver Davis, is a longtime Democratic member of the Common Council. \u201cIn times like these, when the political winds are fiercely blowing across our country, it\u2019s important for us to have an experienced leader who has been through the diverse storms of life to guide our country,\u201d Mr. Davis said in an endorsement released by the Biden campaign. Mr. Davis has been a frequent critic of Mr. Buttigieg since the mayor took office in 2012, seeking, for example, to tap the brakes on a signature initiative of the mayor\u2019s to demolish or repair 1,000 run-down houses in 1,000 days. In 2016, he voted against the mayor\u2019s effort to hire a diversity officer. When a white officer from the South Bend Police Department fatally shot a black resident in June, setting off protests and anguished town hall events, the episode exposed deep distrust between the police and some members of South Bend\u2019s minority community. Mr. Davis emerged as a sharp critic of the mayor\u2019s management of the police in the national media. Mr. Buttigieg, who has climbed in recent polls of Iowa and New Hampshire, is in danger of seeing his candidacy for the Democratic nomination hit a wall if he cannot win more support from black voters and black leaders. Mr. Buttigieg, speaking to CNN on Friday, said he respected Mr. Davis but emphasized that black voters in his hometown were not monolithic. \u201cI am proud of some of the black supporters who know me best, from Indiana and from South Bend, who have not only supported our campaign, but traveled with us and helped tell the story of our community,\u201d he said. In an interview this week, Mr. Davis said that to him, Mr. Buttigieg and even Senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker looked too risky to defeat President Trump next year. \u201cWe are at meat and potatoes time,\u201d he said, praising Mr. Biden. Mr. Davis, a social worker, expressed displeasure that Mr. Buttigieg got too much credit for South Bend\u2019s revival, when the Common Council was a partner and some initiatives predated the mayor. \u201cWe planted the seeds prior to him. He\u2019s reaped the seeds,\u201d he said of the mayor. \u201cTo me the exact story if you want to write it is: Pete did a real good job of harvesting.\u201d Mr. Davis ran this year to succeed Mr. Buttigieg, whose term ends in December. The councilman lost in a crowded primary to James Mueller, now mayor-elect, a former top Buttigieg aide who had the mayor\u2019s financial and political backing. In somewhat colorful language, Mr. Davis said his criticism of Mr. Buttigieg was not personal. \u201cDoes Oliver hate Pete? No. It\u2019s an honor to have him run for president. People know our city now more than ever before,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when I saw his zipper down, I told him,\u201d he added.",
