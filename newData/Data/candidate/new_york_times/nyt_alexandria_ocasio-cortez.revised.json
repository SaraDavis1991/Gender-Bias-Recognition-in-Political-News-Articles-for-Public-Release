Next Is Everest.Tuesday\u2019s victory by Mr. Jealous, a Bernie Sanders ally, emboldened Democrats seeking to push the party left. Now he\u2019ll face a popular Republican incumbent.By Daniel VictorPRINT EDITIONJune 28, 2018",
      "author": "Daniel Victor",
      "content": " Democrats searching for sparks of progressive energy see the ascent of Benjamin T. Jealous in Maryland as an encouraging electoral sign. Mr. Jealous, the former head of the N.A.A.C.P., is an ally of Senator Bernie Sanders who had campaigned for governor on single-payer health care and tuition-free college, among other Sanders-like positions. On Tuesday, he emerged from a crowded Democratic primary field by beating a more moderate candidate, Rushern Baker, by more than 10 percentage points. Along with the seismic triumph of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New York, his victory signaled enthusiasm behind Democratic candidates who are further to the left than many incumbents and added to the debate about how their positions will affect the party\u2019s chances in general elections. Whatever Mr. Jealous\u2019s odds of victory are in November, at the moment he\u2019s widely seen as an underdog to the popular incumbent governor, Larry Hogan, a Republican who has enjoyed approval ratings in the 60s and topped out at 71 in January. A Washington Post poll from May 29 to June 3 had Mr. Hogan ahead of Mr. Jealous in a hypothetical election by 12 points. At a news conference on Wednesday, Mr. Jealous said that he was unconcerned by the odds, and that winning the primary had itself been a \u201csteep climb.\u201d \u201cYou tell us beating Hogan is like beating Everest? Well, we just climbed K2,\u201d he said, referring to world\u2019s second-highest mountain. \u201cIf you can climb K2, you can climb Everest.\u201d Mr. Hogan, who has distanced himself from President Trump, moved quickly to portray Mr. Jealous as a free-spending candidate of the extreme left. \u201cHis risky and irresponsible schemes would require massive middle-class tax hikes that would wreck our economy and put thousands out of work,\u201d said Scott Sloofman, Mr. Hogan\u2019s communications director. If elected, Mr. Jealous would be the first African-American governor of Maryland. Mr. Jealous led the N.A.A.C.P. from 2008 to 2013. The Baltimore Sun\u2019s editorial board named him Marylander of the Year in 2013, writing that he had brought \u201cenergy, vision and focus to an organization in need of all three.\u201d He is currently a partner at Kapor Capital, an investment firm. He endorsed Mr. Sanders, independent of Vermont, for president during the Democratic primary in February 2016, pledging to increase the senator\u2019s support among black voters and saying he had \u201cthe best plan for ending mass incarceration and improving community policing.\u201d Martin O\u2019Malley, the former governor of Maryland, credited Mr. Jealous with helping to repeal the death penalty and passing the Maryland Dream Act, which helps some undocumented young people with education costs, among other measures. But Mr. O\u2019Malley was among several political heavyweights in Maryland to endorse his closest competitor, Mr. Baker, in the primary. On Wednesday, he said by email that Mr. Jealous could win the general election if he speaks to \u201ckitchen table issues \u2014 education, the well-being of Maryland families, the health of our bay, public safety in every neighborhood.\u201d While a lot can happen between June and November, Mr. Hogan certainly starts with the better position. He has the incumbency advantage, more campaign funds and high approval ratings.",

      "author": "Sydney Ember",
      "content": " Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a potential Democratic presidential candidate known for far-left stances on issues of economic inequality, introduced legislation on Thursday that would increase the number of wealthy Americans subject to the estate tax. With the bill, Mr. Sanders joins a growing chorus of left-wing politicians calling for new ways to tax the rich. Last week, Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator who has announced her 2020 candidacy, introduced a plan for a so-called ultramillionaire tax on households with a net worth of $50 million or more. And Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York recently proposed a 70 percent top rate on income over $10 million a year, intensifying the conversation within the Democratic Party about tax policies aimed at addressing income inequality. In his plan, Mr. Sanders proposed applying an estate tax when someone leaves assets worth more than $3.5 million to his or her heirs, the same level as in 2009. The plan significantly lowers the threshold under the current tax law, passed in late 2017, which raised the amount an individual is allowed to transfer before facing any estate tax to roughly $11 million; couples can pass on twice that much. The tax-the-rich proposals, including the one introduced by Mr. Sanders, are designed to increase revenue to pay for expanded social programs like \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d Though Mr. Sanders, 77, has not yet announced he is running for president, he appears to be actively moving toward a 2020 campaign. Republicans, for their part, have repeatedly tried to thwart efforts to broaden the estate tax, which they call the \u201cdeath tax.\u201d President Trump has described the estate tax as \u201ccrushing,\u201d \u201chorrible,\u201d and \u201cunfair,\u201d and on Monday, three Republican senators including Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, introduced legislation to permanently repeal the estate tax. Mr. Trump and other opponents of the estate tax have positioned a repeal as a way to help farmers, ranchers and small business owners Mr. Sanders\u2019s estate tax plan, which he said would affect the wealthiest 0.2 percent of Americans, is similar to one he introduced during his 2016 presidential campaign, when he finished second to Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primary race. Mr. Sanders also supports the idea of a wealth tax, which he outlined in a list of financing options for \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d In addition to expanding the number of Americans affected by the estate tax, Mr. Sanders\u2019s plan establishes different tax rates depending on the size of the inheritance. An estate valued from $3.5 million to $10 million would be taxed at a rate of 45 percent, for instance. A top rate of 77 percent would be levied on estates valued in excess of $1 billion. The plan would also end tax breaks for so-called dynasty trusts, which allow the wealthiest Americans to transfer their wealth from generation to generation for hundreds of years without paying estate or gift taxes. \u201cInstead of repealing the estate tax as Sen. McConnell proposed this week, we need to substantially increase the estate tax on the wealthiest families in America and reduce wealth inequality in America,\u201d Mr. Sanders said in a statement. \u201cWe need a tax system which asks the billionaire class to pay its fair share of taxes and which reduces the obscene level of wealth inequality in America.\u201d",

      "author": "Reuters",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Representative Elise Stefanik, once best known for becoming the youngest woman elected to Congress, stepped into center stage this week as a vocal defender of President Donald Trump during televised impeachment hearings. The three-term congresswoman was one of the sharpest questioners of the three diplomats who testified at public hearings on Wednesday and Friday, overshadowing some colleagues better known for their vociferous defense of the president. Stefanik, 35, has been rated as one of the most bipartisan members of the House, representing a district in northern New York that backed Democratic President Barack Obama in 2012 before going for Trump in 2016. She was the youngest woman elected to Congress when she took office in 2015 at age 30, but that record was broken last year by Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who was elected at 29. Stefanik seized the spotlight in this week's hearings when she repeatedly interrupted the panel's chairman, Democratic Representative Adam Schiff, to raise points of order and accuse him of mishandling the hearing including by following previously published rules for the impeachment process. Stefanik also has literally been one of the loudest voices in the hearing, leaning closely into her microphone each time she speaks, so her voice echoed throughout the room. \"Will the chairman continue to prohibit witnesses from answering Republican questions, as you've done in closed hearings and as you did ...\" Stefanik interjected on Friday. \"The gentlewoman will suspend,\" Schiff said. \"... this week...\" she continued \"That is not a proper...\" Schiff began. \"When you interrupted our questions?\" she asked. 'CONCISE, COHERENT' On Wednesday, Stefanik closely questioned the two diplomats, William Taylor and George Kent, who testified at the first public hearing. She hit the main Republican talking points, arguing that military aid withheld from Ukraine was eventually released and discussing Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President Joe Biden. \"For the millions of Americans viewing today, the two most important facts are the following. Number one, Ukraine received aid, number two, there was in fact no investigation into Biden,\" she said. The conservative-leaning National Review praised her performance as \"a concise, coherent, 'no harm, no foul' defense stronger than other arguments Trump's allies have made.\" On Friday, questioning former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, Stefanik's profile was also high. She provided a contrast with the line of Republican men who questioned the veteran diplomat, as the only woman from the party on the intelligence panel. Nunes yielded to Stefanik on Friday as questioning by committee members began, making her one of the first Republicans to speak during the hearing. Stefanik expressed appreciation for Yovanovitch's work before questioning her. \"I wanted to thank you for your 30 years of public service, from Mogadishu to Ottawa to Moscow to London to Kiev. I also wanted to thank you for hosting the numerous bipartisan delegations. I led one of those delegations in Ukraine,\" Stefanik said. There are only 13 Republican women in the House, compared with 89 Democrats. Stefanik has started a political action committee dedicated at least partly toward increasing their numbers.

      "content": "The House of Representatives voted Tuesday on a resolution condemning recent remarks by President Trump as \u201cracist comments that have legitimized increased fear and hatred of new Americans and people of color.\u201d Mr. Trump had attacked four congresswomen of color \u2014 Representatives Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ayanna S.

Republicans should not show \u2018weakness\u2019 and fall into their trap.\u201d [Read the latest coverage on the vote.] The following is the text of the resolution, as released by Congress. _________________________ Condemning President Trump\u2019s racist comments directed at Members of Congress. IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES July 15, 2019 Mr. Malinowski (for himself, Ms. Jayapal, Mr. Ted Lieu of California, Mr. Garc\u00eda of Illinois, Mr. Carbajal, Ms. Omar, Mr. Krishnamoorthi, Ms. Mucarsel-Powell, Mrs. Torres of California, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, Ms. Tlaib, Ms. Pressley, Mr. Raskin, Ms. Jackson Lee, and Mr. Espaillat) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary RESOLUTION Condemning President Trump\u2019s racist comments directed at Members of Congress. Whereas the Founders conceived America as a haven of refuge for people fleeing from religious and political persecution, and Thomas Jefferson, Alexander Hamilton, and James Madison all emphasized that the Nation gained as it attracted new people in search of freedom and livelihood for their families; Whereas the Declaration of Independence defined America as a covenant based on equality, the unalienable Rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, and government by the consent of the people; Whereas Benjamin Franklin said at the Constitutional convention, \u201cWhen foreigners after looking about for some other Country in which they can obtain more happiness, give a preference to ours, it is a proof of attachment which ought to excite our confidence and affection\u201d; Whereas President Franklin D. Roosevelt said, \u201cRemember, remember always, that all of us, and you and I especially, are descended from immigrants and revolutionists\u201d; Whereas immigration of people from all over the Earth has defined every stage of American history and propelled our social, economic, political, scientific, cultural, artistic, and technological progress as a people, and all Americans, except for the descendants of Native people and enslaved African Americans, are immigrants or descendants of immigrants; Whereas the commitment to immigration and asylum has been not a partisan cause but a powerful national value that has infused the work of many Presidents; Whereas American patriotism is defined not by race or ethnicity but by devotion to the Constitutional ideals of equality, liberty, inclusion, and democracy and by service to our communities and struggle for the common good; Whereas President John F. Kennedy, whose family came to the United States from Ireland, stated in his 1958 book \u201cA Nation of Immigrants\u201d that \u201cThe contribution of immigrants can be seen in every aspect of our national life. We see it in religion, in politics, in business, in the arts, in education, even in athletics and entertainment. There is no part of our nation that has not been touched by our immigrant background. Everywhere immigrants have enriched and strengthened the fabric of American life.\u201d; Whereas President Ronald Reagan in his last speech as President conveyed \u201cAn observation about a country which I love\u201d; Whereas as President Reagan observed, the torch of Lady Liberty symbolizes our freedom and represents our heritage, the compact with our parents, our grandparents, and our ancestors, and it is the Statue of Liberty and its values that give us our great and special place in the world; Whereas other countries may seek to compete with us, but in one vital area, as \u201ca beacon of freedom and opportunity that draws the people of the world, no country on Earth comes close\u201d; Whereas it is the great life force of \u201ceach generation of new Americans that guarantees that America\u2019s triumph shall continue unsurpassed\u201d through the 21st century and beyond and is part of the \u201cmagical, intoxicating power of America\u201d; Whereas this is \u201cone of the most important sources of America\u2019s greatness: we lead the world because, unique among nations, we draw our people \u2014 our strength \u2014 from every country and every corner of the world, and by doing so we continuously renew and enrich our nation\u201d; Whereas \u201cthanks to each wave of new arrivals to this land of opportunity, we\u2019re a nation forever young, forever bursting with energy and new ideas, and always on the cutting edge\u201d, always leading the world to the next frontier; Whereas this openness is vital to our future as a Nation, and \u201cif we ever closed the door to new Americans, our leadership in the world would soon be lost\u201d; and Whereas President Donald Trump\u2019s racist comments have legitimized fear and hatred of new Americans and people of color: Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the House of Representatives\u2014 (1) believes that immigrants and their descendants have made America stronger, and that those who take the oath of citizenship are every bit as American as those whose families have lived in the United States for many generations; (2) is committed to keeping America open to those lawfully seeking refuge and asylum from violence and oppression, and those who are willing to work hard to live the American Dream, no matter their race, ethnicity, faith, or country of origin; and (3) strongly condemns President Donald Trump\u2019s racist comments that have legitimized and increased fear and hatred of new Americans and people of color by saying that our fellow Americans who are immigrants, and those who may look to the President like immigrants, should \u201cgo back\u201d to other countries, by referring to immigrants and asylum seekers as \u201cinvaders,\u201d and by saying that Members of Congress who are immigrants (or those of our colleagues who are wrongly assumed to be immigrants) do not belong in Congress or in the United States of America.",

      "content": "Good Wednesday morning. Here are some of the stories making news in Washington and politics today. _____________________ \u2022 The United States has emerged as a nation with highest tariff rate among developed countries, including China. Initially seen as a short-term strategy to force other countries to drop their trade barriers, President Trump\u2019s tariffs increasingly look like a more permanent economic tool. \u2022 As Mr. Trump has struggled to explain his dealings with China, he has continued to argue that a Democratic president would handle things worse. The main target of his criticism has been Joe Biden, much to the chagrin of G.O.P. strategists and to the benefit of Mr. Biden\u2019s election campaign. \u2022 As the Trump administration draws up war plans and accuses Iran of threatening American troops and interests, allies of the United States are skeptical that this is any different from the usual tug of war between the two countries, leaving the prospect of domestic and international support in flux. \u2022 The House Intelligence Committee is investigating whether lawyers tied to Mr. Trump and his family \u2014 including Michael D. Cohen \u2014 helped obstruct the panel\u2019s inquiry into Russian election interference by shaping false testimony. \u2022 After an intraparty standoff, Donald Trump Jr. and a Republican-controlled Senate Intelligence Committee reached a deal for the younger Mr. Trump to sit for a private, time-limited interview with senators. \u2022 A court case examining an attempt by a personal lawyer for Mr. Trump to block a congressional subpoena seeking years of financial records from Mr. Trump\u2019s accounting firm is an early test of the president\u2019s vow to stymie all subpoenas, and could be the start of a fight over congressional oversight. \u2022 The federal prosecutor tapped to scrutinize the origins of the Russia investigation, John H. Durham, is conducting only a review for now and has not opened any criminal inquiry, meaning that he does not have the power to subpoena documents and cannot compel witnesses to testify. \u2022 A review of the Nation Rifle Association\u2019s tax records by The New York Times shows that the powerful lobbying group has increasingly relied on cash infusions and other transactions involving its charitable arm \u2014 at least $206 million worth since 2010. \u2022 Democrats are moving aggressively to defend their majority in the House in 2020, and rushing to protect the seats they hold in districts that supported the president in 2016. \u2022 The number of Democratic presidential candidates has hit 22: Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana joined the race, vowing to elevate the issue of campaign finance and, more implicitly, to make Democrats competitive again across the country\u2019s interior. \u2022 Elizabeth Warren said that she would not participate in a Fox News town hall as some other Democratic candidates have, calling the media outlet \u201ca hate-for-profit racket\u201d that seeks to turn Americans against each other. \u2022 Tensions between Mr. Biden and other Democrats over his stance on climate change have escalated, after Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez lashed out at \u201cmiddle ground\u201d approaches to the issue in a thinly veiled criticism of the former vice president. _____________________ Today\u2019s On Politics briefing was compiled by Margaret Kramer in New York.

      "author": "Matt Stevens",
      "content": " About half of registered voters believe President Trump is racist, according to a new national poll released Tuesday, which showed voters are sharply divided along partisan lines on the question. The survey was conducted by Quinnipiac University from July 25 to 28, several days after Mr. Trump said that a group of four congresswomen of color should \u201cgo back\u201d to the countries they came from, even though all four are American citizens and three were born in the United States. The survey period also included the day that the president launched a new attack on Representative Elijah E. Cummings, a leading black congressman, calling him \u201ca brutal bully\u201d whose Baltimore-area district he characterized as a \u201cdisgusting, rat and rodent infested mess.\u201d The poll results come as Democrats seeking the party\u2019s nomination for president prepare for a second round of debates, beginning Tuesday night in Detroit. Nearly all of the 2020 candidates have roundly condemned Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks as racist and divisive. The Quinnipiac poll found that 51 percent of voters think Mr. Trump is racist while 45 percent do not. When separated by party, 86 percent of Democratic voters classified Mr. Trump as racist while 91 percent of Republicans said he was not. About 88 percent of those who said Mr. Trump was racist disapprove of the job he is doing as president, while 94 percent of those who said he was not racist approve of his performance. It was one of several surveys in recent days that have offered a window into how Americans are processing Mr. Trump\u2019s comments and assessing his core beliefs. National polls conducted by USA Today/Ipsos, The Economist/YouGov and Fox News this month have shown that between half and two-thirds of Americans believe that telling someone to \u201cgo back\u201d is a racist statement and that Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets \u201ccross the line.\u201d On Monday, Mr. Trump again attacked a prominent black person \u2014this time the Rev. Al Sharpton, a civil rights leader. Mr. Trump denounced Mr. Sharpton on Twitter as \u201ca con man\u201d who \u201cHates Whites & Cops\u201d and again assailed Mr. Cummings. He also linked the clash with Mr. Cummings to his demand that the four Democratic congresswomen of color \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ayanna S. Pressley of Massachusetts \u2014 leave the country. Days after Mr. Trump\u2019s first tweets about the congresswomen, the House passed a resolution, largely along party lines, condemning his remarks. Mr. Trump has denied that his words were racist and called the House resolution a \u201ccon game.\u201d \u201cThose Tweets were NOT Racist,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote on the day the House voted to condemn them. \u201cI don\u2019t have a Racist bone in my body! The poll released Tuesday found that 41 percent of survey respondents believe his immigration policies are motivated by \u201cracist beliefs,\u201d compared with 49 percent who ascribed them to \u201ca sincere interest in controlling our borders.\u201d The poll surveyed 1,306 voters nationwide and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.",

      "author": "Nick Corasaniti",
      "content": " Two minutes after Speaker Nancy Pelosi had announced an official impeachment inquiry, the Trump campaign placed a new ad on Facebook, dropping $12,000 on an \u201cImpeachment Poll\u201d for its supporters. Days later, the Trump campaign poured $8 million into a national television and digital ad campaign, releasing a television ad spinning the impeachment inquiry on unfounded conspiracy theories about former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son Hunter Biden. (CNN refused to air the ad, citing inaccuracies.) All told, more than $13.6 million has been invested in trying to change public opinion on impeachment since the inquiry was announced, according to an analysis by Advertising Analytics, an ad monitoring company. In those four weeks of a rapidly escalating ad war, the messaging that will likely dominate the early stages of the election is coming into focus. \u201cIf anyone is a history buff \u2014 and the Spanish Civil War was the precursor to World War II, when all the tactics got tested \u2014 then this is the Spanish Civil War for the upcoming presidential election ad wars,\u201d said Ken Goldstein, a professor of politics at the University of San Francisco. For President Trump and his Republican allies, any effort that counters the president, including impeachment, is painted as evidence of a vast, far-left conspiracy. In ads from the campaign and from the Republican National Committee, the alleged far-left assault is illustrated largely through repetitive mentions and images of Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar, two freshman Democrats known for their outspoken progressive values and criticism of Mr. Trump, but not as leaders of the impeachment inquiry. Additionally, Republicans are presenting the inquiry as a diversion: Support of the inquiry, the ads state, means breaking the 2018 midterm election promises of focusing on key issues like improving health care and lowering drug prices. Democrats, at first largely loath to talk much about the impeachment inquiry for fear of appearing to politicize the issue, have quickly been put on the defensive. But in $1.5 million in ads from House Majority Forward, a Democratic-aligned super PAC, launched in defense of the freshman Democrats targeted by Republicans, there is nary a mention of impeachment. Instead, they are positive ads focused largely on local accomplishments. \u201cForget the noise,\u201d one ad from House Majority Forward said in favor of Haley Stevens, a freshman Democrat in Michigan, noting she was \u201cfocused on Michigan and getting the job done.\u201d The biggest advertiser surrounding impeachment, unsurprisingly, is the Trump campaign. With a $150 million-plus war chest, the president\u2019s re-election campaign has dominated paid messaging on all platforms, most visibly on Facebook, raising concerns among Democratic operatives about its control over the digital conversation. Indeed, Mr. Trump is vastly outspending Democrats on Facebook. He tripled his overall weekly buy of Facebook ads as soon as the impeachment inquiry was announced, and has spent $1.25 million on impeachment ads over the four weeks following the announcement of the inquiry, dwarfing even Tom Steyer, the billionaire candidate flooding airwaves and websites to raise his profile. But Mr. Trump\u2019s targeting in impeachment ads on Facebook reflects a similar strategy seen in his social media presence: Rather than focusing on persuading independents or voters in states crucial to his re-election, he has instead targeted areas where he has broad support, with advertising designed to fire up his base. [Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter.] More than 50 percent of his Facebook impeachment advertising is in states not competitive in 2020, according to an analysis of Facebook ads by Bully Pulpit Interactive, a Democratic consultancy group. Just 9 percent of his ads are in the critical swing states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. Ten percent went to Texas alone. \u201cImpeachment is just the latest tool that Trump\u2019s using to enrage and activate the voters already in his corner,\u201d said Daniel Scarvalone, a senior director at Bully Pulpit. Notably, the Trump campaign put barely any resources online behind attacks on Mr. Biden, with roughly $78,000 in Facebook ads invoking some mention of Mr. Biden and his son\u2019s business dealings in Ukraine, according to Bully Pulpit. \u201cYou used to have to make an ad and air it on TV to get the media to fall for it,\u201d said Mr. Goldstein. \u201cNow you spend a couple thousand bucks on Facebook and have a press conference.\u201d The focus on Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and Ms. Omar is evident in nearly every ad aligned with the president. In four ads from the Club for Growth, a conservative anti-tax group, that similarly target freshman Democratic representatives, members of the so-called Squad  \u2014 which includes Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, Ms. Omar, and Representatives Ayanna Pressley and Rashida Tlaib \u2014 are front and center. Perhaps unsurprisingly, strategists say it is because criticizing and using images of the Squad also appeals to the Republican targets for impeachment ads. \u201cThey consistently test well in both focus groups and polling,\u201d said Tom Schultz, vice president of campaigns for the Club for Growth, referring to the four congresswomen. Though the impeachment inquiry is centered on Mr. Trump, part of the Republican Party\u2019s strategy has been to target a core of freshman Democrats in swing districts and erode enthusiasm for impeachment in those areas, pitching support of the inquiry as ignoring progress on other issues. From Oct. 2-9, the R.N.C. spent $1.3 million on versions of these ads targeting 14 different Democratic house freshmen. \u201cInstead of fixing health care and lowering drug prices,\u201d an ad from the Republican National Committee blares, the House freshman Democrats all vote \u201cwith the radicals for endless investigations of President Trump.\u201d The Republican effort forced House Majority Forward on the air, launching positive spots for 11 of the targeted House Democrats that focus on how they have worked to lower drug prices through Ms. Pelosi\u2019s newly passed bill and other health care efforts. \u201cThat\u2019s why he\u2019s doing the hard work others won\u2019t,\u201d one ad says in support of Representative Antonio Delgado, a freshman Democrat from a district in New York that Mr. Trump won in 2016. The ad goes on to say Mr. Delgado \u201ctook on the big drug companies to bring down the cost of prescription drugs.\u201d Though the Democratic presidential candidates have all tried to avoid focusing on impeachment, for fear of appearing to politicize it, many of the leading campaigns have still used impeachment in advertisements on Facebook to either drum up support or work toward donor acquisition. \u201cSpeaker Nancy Pelosi is right: In America, nobody is above the law,\u201d wrote the campaign of Senator Kamala Harris, which spent $36,000 on Facebook impeachment ads, according to Bully Pulpit. \u201cSign our card to thank Speaker Pelosi for taking up the cause of impeachment.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s time for Congress to step up and begin impeachment proceedings,\u201d the campaign of Senator Elizabeth Warren posted in an ad. \u201cAdd your name if you agree with Elizabeth.\u201d The Warren campaign spent about $70,000 on Facebook ads targeting impeachment, according to Bully Pulpit. These ads, known in political operative speak as acquisition ads, are designed to help candidates gather data on potential supporters or donors and continue to target messages toward them. But as a sign of just how vast the impeachment ad wars have become, one of the top spenders on Facebook wasn\u2019t even a political entity. Instead, it was a spice company based in Wisconsin, Penzeys Spices, that dropped nearly $100,000 in just a week on ads calling for Mr. Trump\u2019s impeachment. \u201cThe political landscape of America is in for the type of sudden shift we haven\u2019t seen in close to 50 years,\u201d the company\u2019s owner, Bill Penzey, wrote in a lengthy Facebook post on Wednesday, outlining the next phase of its impeachment advertising plan. \u201cYou might want to buckle up.\u201d",

      "content": " Optimism filled the Prospect Park air as more than 100 supporters of Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s presidential campaign gathered last week for an organizing event called \u201cHow to Be All In for Elizabeth.\u201d But as dusk approached, the final \u201cShe Has a Plan\u201d button was handed out, and the crowd of mostly millennial Brooklynites began to disperse, hope gave way to skepticism. Michael Rose, 36, expressed concern that a candidate like former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. would earn the party\u2019s nomination, and that Democrats, faced with a historically diverse field, would choose \u201can old white guy that appeals to moderates.\u201d Amelita Lijek, 31, said the primary represented a crossroads for the party. \u201cWe have this choice here: to go positive and go with what feels inspiring, or to live in doubt and cower,\u201d Ms. Lijek said. \u201cIt\u2019s terrifying.\u201d After months of liberal senators dominating the Democratic presidential primary, and leftist ideas such as the Green New Deal and \u201cMedicare for All\u201d getting significant national attention, Mr. Biden\u2019s entrance into the race last month has swung the conversation back toward the center. The result: rising tensions within the Democratic electorate between liberal activists who don\u2019t want their policy ideas and favored candidates to lose ground, and some party officials and voters who hope to see moderate candidates gain even more momentum. [Sign up for our politics newsletter and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race.] Since 2016, when Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont thrust policy proposals like free college and single-payer health care into the national debate during his presidential run, progressives have tried to deepen their foothold in the party \u2014 and by some measures, they have succeeded. Last year saw the election to the House of Representatives of uncompromising liberals with new ideas and large social media followings such as Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. The Congressional Progressive Caucus swelled to 98 members. Organizations like Justice Democrats and the Democratic Socialists of America have expanded their ranks. Yet it is Mr. Biden who currently enjoys an early lead by most traditional measures, buoyed by high name recognition and a perception among some voters that he is best suited to defeat President Trump. That perception has sometimes been fueled by bias, including the sexist belief that female candidates are more likely to lose. And Mr. Biden has courted the front-runner image by refusing to engage with his primary rivals and singularly focusing on Mr. Trump. These political dynamics will challenge the muscle of the Democratic Party\u2019s left wing, which is desperate to see a nominee who embraces liberal ideas and engages with activists. \u201cThis is what we\u2019re going to test,\u201d said Faiz Shakir, the campaign manager for Mr. Sanders. \u201cWhere are people at?\u201d In private conversations, organizers at liberal political groups say Mr. Biden\u2019s entry has helped clarify any lingering doubts: A steep uphill climb lies ahead, and victory is not guaranteed. \u201cThis is the reality,\u201d said Matt Morrison, executive director of Working America, a labor-focused organizing group. \u201cAs this campaign unfolds and as this nomination process unfolds, whoever succeeds in this death match\u201d will be seen as the candidate who showed \u201cthe path to victory in the Democratic Party.\u201d Maurice Mitchell, national director for the Working Families Party, said if candidates who back progressive ideas uniformly struggle in 2020, moderate Democrats and party leadership may take it as a sign that signature issues like \u201cMedicare for All\u201d can be ignored without consequences. He cautioned moderate Democrats, however, against using Mr. Biden\u2019s early lead as a reason to take a premature victory lap. \u201cAt this point in the cycle, anybody that tells you that they know what the outcome would be is either working for a candidate, has endorsed the candidate or is lying to you,\u201d Mr. Mitchell said. The left flank of the Democratic Party faces unique obstacles during this presidential primary, even with the megaphone of Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, the policy ideas of Ms. Warren and the grass-roots energy of Mr. Sanders. [Keep up with the 2020 field with our candidate tracker.] They are up against not only those who dismiss their policy goals as unrealistic, but also a perception in some corners of the Democratic electorate that defeating Mr. Trump is paramount \u2014 and that that goal is somehow at odds with embracing disruptive ideas or structural policy change. This idea, that embracing progressive change and defeating Mr. Trump are in conflict, is often pushed by Republicans, who have long argued that Democrats have trended too leftward for the American public. Public opinion polls show broad support for issues like climate change prevention or universal health care. But in a recent Harvard-Harris poll, a plurality of Democrats identified as \u201cObama Democrats,\u201d which may be a challenge for candidates like Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders, who have tried to paint the incrementalist policies of that era as insufficient. Moderate Democrats, particularly in Washington, have sought to cast progressives as a noisy but powerless force. \u201cTwitter is not real life\u201d has become a rallying cry, meant to imply that people like Ms. Ocasio-Cortez or Mr. Sanders have exerted undue influence on the party\u2019s direction. \u201cDemocrats need a message and an agenda that can unite the broadest possible coalition to defeat Donald Trump in 2020,\u201d said one statement on the website for Third Way, a political organization focused on building a Democratic Party that sticks to more centrist principles. \u201cThe path to power wasn\u2019t built on a Sanders-style agenda.\u201d Yvette Simpson, chief executive officer of the progressive grass-roots group Democracy for America, said the idea that embracing progressive policies would help Mr. Trump win was a Republican narrative with little backing. She said she believed the entire party had moved leftward, noting that even Mr. Biden had announced his campaign would reject money from lobbyists and corporate PACs. (Mr. Biden still has significant backing from wealthy Democratic donors, and he held a high-dollar fund-raiser on his first day in the presidential race.) \u201cBiden\u2019s ability to win should be measured against whether he excites the left of the party,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause if he doesn\u2019t do that \u2014 even if he wins the nomination \u2014 he won\u2019t win the race.\u201d It comes back to a fundamental schism among Democratic candidates over whether it is more important to win over voters lost to Mr. Trump and Republicans or to motivate the Democrats who sat out the 2016 election, including those who are younger and people of color. Neil Sroka, a spokesman for Democracy for America, said it would be a mistake to view the primary as a referendum on progressives. \u201cThe establishment is the establishment because they have the lion\u2019s share of the power within the Democratic Party,\u201d he said. Maria Svart, the national director for the Democratic Socialists of America, said her organization views its insurgency against Democrats as a long-term struggle, and that it exists outside of any particular candidate or election cycle. \u201cPeople are sick and tired of being ignored by both parties, in all states in this country, and are looking for a way that they can make an impact,\u201d Ms. Svart said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we focus on grass-roots organizing.\u201d At the Brooklyn gathering of Ms. Warren\u2019s supporters, attendees were cleareyed on the challenges ahead. They loved Ms. Warren, they said, as they snacked on free pizza and relished the opportunity to take selfies with a cardboard cutout of the presidential candidate. But they believed, as one supporter put it, that Mr. Biden represented the country\u2019s \u201ccomfort zone.\u201d \u201cJoe Biden is not going to change. He\u2019s going to rest on his laurels,\u201d said Mallory Muratore, 25. \u201cIt\u2019s a little scary, because we need people to look past that.\u201d Steve Parry, 36, said the primary was an essential opportunity for progressives to prove they could \u201cwin something.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve been showing up,\u201d he said, \u201cbut now we need results.\u201d",

Looks for Democratic Divisions|January 29, 2019, Page A15",
      "author": "Catie Edmondson",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 The Senate voted Monday to advance legislation affirming the right of local and state governments to break ties with companies that boycott or divest from Israel, as Republicans try to drive a wedge between the Democratic Party and its traditional allies in the American Jewish community. The bipartisan legislation reauthorizes assistance to Israel and Jordan and imposes additional sanctions on individuals providing support for the Syrian government. But Republican leaders added a provision by Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, that aims to curtail support for the boycott, divest and sanctions \u2014 or B.D.S. \u2014 movement, which seeks to pressure Israel into ending the occupation of the West Bank. The late inclusion was an opportunity for Republicans to draw out the new generation of insurgent liberal representatives who have been critical of Israel. Republicans are trying to paint them as extremist, and even anti-Semitic, as they try to push moderate voters away from a Democratic Party moving left. The Senate voted 74 to 19 on Monday to cut off debate on the measure, with final passage expected on Wednesday. Representatives Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, a Somali refugee; Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, the first Palestinian-American woman to serve in the House; and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York have emerged as the most vocal supporters of Palestinian rights, and as high-profile targets of Republicans. The three represent heavily Democratic districts, with supportive constituents, but Republicans hope to tar the whole party with their views. \u201cI don\u2019t see much hope for changing where Tlaib and Omar are, but there is a battle in the Democratic Party,\u201d said Norm Coleman, the national chairman of the Republican Jewish Coalition and a former senator from Minnesota. \u201cIt is a message to Jews who still care about Israel, to say, \u2018You\u2019ll be much more comfortable in the Republican Party.\u2019\u201d The message extends further to other House Democrats, Mr. Coleman added, who \u201cwill have to make choices about whether they\u2019ll quiet those voices or whether they\u2019ll remain quiet.\u201d With Britain\u2019s Labour Party embracing anti-Israel policies, and other left-wing parties in Europe courting Muslim immigrant voters, Jews in the United States have eyed the toehold that Palestinian rights activists have secured in the Democratic Party with trepidation. Republicans see an opportunity. The inclusion of the anti-B.D.S. provision will most likely kill the Senate package in the House. Lawmakers in the lower chamber will instead take its pieces one at a time, and have already passed the Syria piece by voice vote this month. The components addressing Jordan and security assistance to Israel are expected to pass easily, as they did last Congress, though they have not yet been reintroduced in the House. There are no plans to take up the anti-B.D.S. provision, and House Democrats have accused Senate Republicans of attaching the fourth bill to score political points and distort the views of liberal lawmakers who favor of a two-state solution in the region. But Republicans are becoming more brash in their accusations. The National Republican Congressional Committee, the political arm devoted to recapturing the majority in the House, has called Ms. Omar and Ms. Tlaib anti-Semites, seizing on writings the freshman lawmakers have posted on social media. Ms. Omar was previously criticized for writing on Twitter in 2012 that Israel had \u201chypnotized\u201d the world from seeing their \u201cevil deeds.\u201d She apologized this month, saying that she was unaware that invoking hypnosis was an \u201canti-Semitic trope.\u201d But she came under fire again when she seemed to defend members of the Black Hebrew Israelites who appeared in a now-viral video goading and yelling at a group of high school students and Native American activists. \u201cIt\u2019s too bad she can\u2019t delete the anti-Semitism in her heart,\u201d the National Republican Congressional Committee said. Senator Kevin Cramer, Republican of North Dakota, mused on Twitter that Democratic opposition to the anti-B.D.S. measure \u201cmay be nothing more than a thinly-veiled attempt to hide the rising anti-Semitism in their own party.\u201d Ms. Tlaib took a swing at the anti-B.D.S. legislation this month, writing on Twitter that \u201cthis is the U.S. where boycotting is a right & part of our historical fight for freedom & equality.\u201d Mr. Rubio fired back, \u201cThis \u2018dual loyalty\u2019 canard is a typical anti-Semitic line.\u201d The movement \u201cisn\u2019t about freedom & equality, it\u2019s about destroying #Israel,\u201d he continued. Democrats have largely scorned those attacks. Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, responded to Mr. Rubio, saying that \u201cyou know it isn\u2019t true\u201d that a significant number \u201cof Senate Dems support BDS.\u201d No Senate Democrats have publicly announced support for the movement, though some liberals, such as Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, have objected to the legislation on the grounds that it would violate freedom of speech. \u201cWhile I do not support the B.D.S. movement, we must defend every American\u2019s constitutional right to engage in political activity,\u201d he said Monday after voting to filibuster the bill. \u201cIt is clear to me that this bill would violate Americans\u2019 First Amendment rights.\u201d Jeremy Ben-Ami, the president of the left-leaning pro-Israel advocacy group J Street, called the attacks on Ms. Tlaib and Ms. Omar \u201cabsolutely disgusting,\u201d and he predicted attempts from \u201ca very tired playbook\u201d to divide the party would fail. \u201cThere will certainly be tensions,\u201d he acknowledged, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think this is a meaningful split. The consensus in the Democratic Party is pretty clear.\u201d A spokesman for Representative Eliot L. Engel, Democrat of New York and the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, referred a reporter to comments Mr. Engel made to The Washington Post this month dismissing Senate Republicans\u2019 efforts as political. Though he said he supports anti-B.D.S. measures, he pointed to an alternative bipartisan approach as preferable. \u201cIf Senate Republicans are serious about dealing with the issue, they\u2019ll look to that compromise,\u201d Mr. Engel said. \u201cOtherwise, this is just playing politics with important foreign-policy matters.\u201d",

Here are some of the stories making news in Washington and politics today. _____________________ \u2022 For years, President Trump was friends with Jeffrey E. Epstein, the billionaire charged with sex trafficking, once calling him a \u201cterrific guy\u201d who \u201clikes beautiful women as much as I do.\u201d While Mr. Trump has since dismissed the relationship, Mr. Epstein has played it up. \u2022 Labor Secretary R. Alexander Acosta on Tuesday faced fresh calls to resign over his role in brokering a lenient plea deal for Mr. Epstein as a federal prosecutor in Miami more than a decade ago. But the president has decided to stand by Mr. Acosta, saying he felt \u201cbadly\u201d for him and praising him as \u201can excellent secretary of labor.\u201d \u2022 A federal appeals court ruled Tuesday that Mr. Trump has been violating the Constitution by blocking people from following his Twitter account because they criticized or mocked him. The ruling could have broader implications for how the First Amendment applies to the social-media era. \u2022 Investigators for the inspector general recently interviewed Christopher Steele, the former British spy whose infamous dossier with links between Trump associates and Russia ended up in the hands of the F.B.I. in 2016. They spent two days with Mr. Steele to try and determine whether the F.B.I. misstepped in the inquiry. \u2022 Tensions between Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and her \u201csquad\u201d of freshmen congresswomen have burst into the open this week over the $4.6 billion border aid package, testing House Democratic unity. \u2022 Amy McGrath, a retired Marine lieutenant colonel and combat pilot who lost her bid for a House seat last year,  wants to challenge Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, for his seat in 2020. \u2022 The midterms were catastrophic for Republican women. But as of last month, 187 of them had filed or expressed interest in running for the House in 2020 \u2014 more than ran in the entire 2018 cycle. \u2022 Joe Biden and his wife earned more than $15 million since he left office, filings show,  contradicting his longtime political persona of \u201cMiddle-Class Joe.\u201d \u2022 Tom Steyer, the former hedge fund investor turned impeachment activist, reversed a decision to not enter the Democratic presidential primary. He plans to spend $100 million on his bid. \u2022 The Judiciary Committee will vote this week on subpoenas targeting the Trump administration\u2019s family separation policy as well as the biggest names in the inquiry into whether the president obstructed justice. \u2022 Ross Perot died on Tuesday. He was a significant figure in modern American politics: He won 19 percent of the vote in 1992, and his outsider campaign paved the way for the presidency of Mr. Trump. _____________________ Today\u2019s On Politics briefing was compiled by Isabella Grull\u00f3n Paz in New York.

Here are some of the stories making news in Washington and politics today. _____________________ \u2022 What seemed like a mixed midterm result for the G.O.P. has turned more grim as Democrats continue to pick up seats in the House and narrow the Republican hold on the Senate. Read about the stronger Democratic gains. \u2022 President Trump is considering firing Kirstjen Nielsen, the secretary of Homeland Security who has long been a target of the president\u2019s displeasure, according to three people close to him. Read about the staff shake-up. \u2022 There were conflicting reports on Tuesday on whether Mira Ricardel, a deputy national security adviser, had been fired. But there is no question that the first lady, Melania Trump, no longer wants her at the White House. \u2022 Mr. Trump issued a blistering personal attack against President Emmanuel Macron of France, and sought to defend his decision not to visit a cemetery of American soldiers while in France because of rain. Read more on his comments. \u2022 With a recount underway in the Florida governor\u2019s race, Andrew Gillum, the Democratic nominee, is back on the campaign trail a week after conceding the election. Though the outcome is unlikely to change, Mr. Gillum has made it clear he is not going away. \u2022 Representative Kyrsten Sinema\u2019s victory marked the first time a Democrat has been elected to the Senate from Arizona since 1988. Read more about Ms. Sinema, and here are six takeaways from her historic race. \u2022 On an otherwise bleak election night for North Dakota Democrats, Ruth Buffalo became the first Native American Democrat elected to the state legislature, unseating the architect of the very law tribes had feared would disenfranchise them. \u2022 As freshman orientation for new members of Congress began, Representative-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez led activists in a protest in Nancy Pelosi\u2019s office. The move is an early notice to Democratic leaders that the new House may be divided. \u2022 Despite a dismal election last week, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California looks set to become House minority leader. Read more about Mr. McCarthy \u2014 and his chances of securing the new role. \u2022 For weeks before the midterms, Mr. Trump warned ominously about the threat from a caravan of migrants streaming toward the United States border. But only a week after the election, he has dropped the issue almost entirely. \u2022 An independent bipartisan commission concluded in a sharply critical report that strained forces and budget shortfalls have cast doubt on the Pentagon\u2019s strategy to confront global threats, in a challenge to Mr. Trump\u2019s commitment to support a strong military. \u2022 Mr. Trump\u2019s trade war is stoking an internal fight among his top economic advisers, with officials sparring over the White House\u2019s approach to dealing with China and other trading partners.

The teacher, identified by school officials as Matt Baish, was placed on administrative leave pending an investigation, the Waterloo Community School District said in an email to teachers and students, the television station KWWL reported on Friday. \u201cThe nature of the content shared rose to the level of putting this employee on administrative leave pending an investigation,\u201d the district said. \u201cWe appreciate your patience as we sort through the details and thank you for respecting the process.\u201d Mason Severson, 27, a former student of Mr. Baish\u2019s, asked in an Oct. 2 Facebook post who was going to attend a climate strike rally in Iowa City on Friday, and linked to an article with a photo of Ms. Thunberg. Mr. Baish responded, \u201cdont have my sniper rifle,\u201d according to the post. Mr. Severson said on Sunday said the post \u201cwas insensitive and taken too far.\u201d \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a joke,\u201d said Mr. Severson, who is a pre-med student at the University of Northern Iowa. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t baseless. It was irrefutably vile and wrong.\u201d Mr. Baish teaches chemistry at West High School in Waterloo, Iowa, about 55 miles north of Cedar Rapids. Mr. Baish, school officials and the Waterloo Education Association, the teachers\u2019 union, could not be reached for comment on Sunday. Ms. Thunberg is a 16-year-old climate activist who began protesting outside of the Swedish parliament last year. After being invited, she spoke at the United Nations last month and made the trip to the United States on the Malizia II \u2014 a racing yacht that uses solar panels and underwater generator turbines \u2014 to avoid producing carbon emissions. Mr. Severson said Ms. Thunberg\u2019s activism was a \u201cworthy cause\u201d because \u201cher words are on all of our \u2014 millennials\u2019 \u2014 lips,\u201d he said. This was not the first time Mr. Baish made a comment on one of Mr. Severson\u2019s Facebook posts that drew attention. In July, Mr. Severson posted photos of Democratic Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan. Mr. Baish commented, \u201call 4 should be out of office...worst Americans in my lifetime.\u201d A friend of Mr. Severson\u2019s, Dasia Mills-Anderson, 29, said on Facebook that Mr. Baish\u2019s comment about Ms. Thunberg was \u201cdisgusting.\u201d On Sunday, she said his remark was \u201cabsolutely vile for anyone, let alone a teacher.\u201d \u201cHe can have his opinion all he wants on climate change and even on Greta Thunberg, but threatening someone\u2019s life, especially a child, takes it too far,\u201d she said. Ms. Thunberg attended the rally on Friday and urged those in attendance to \u201cnever give up.\u201d \u201cNo matter what, we need to continue, no matter how hopeless the situation may seem like, we must always carry on and we must never allow ourselves to give up,\u201d Ms. Thunberg said. \u201cThat is simply not an option.\u201d",

      "content": " Hi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I\u2019m Lisa Lerer, your host. [Get On Politics delivered to your inbox.] The 2016 election was a perfect storm for conspiracy theories. On one side of the race there was a Republican nominee known for peddling conspiracies, most famously that President Barack Obama wasn\u2019t born in the United States. On the other side was a Democrat whose family had spawned a cottage industry of sordid tales. I\u2019m sure you remember the highlights: John F. Kennedy assassins, seizures covered up by the Secret Service, Manchurian candidates, child trafficking centers masquerading as D.C. pizza joints, etc. At one point, it felt like everyone involved in that election had gotten caught up in some kind of conspiracy theory. (Including me!) I was reminded of that craziness this week, after The Washington Times retracted and apologized for a column about Seth Rich, the Democratic National Committee staff member whose unsolved killing in 2016 sparked  conspiracy theories. Though the police believe Mr. Rich may have been killed in a botched robbery effort, many figures on the right \u2014 including Sean Hannity \u2014 have connected the death to the leak of D.N.C. emails. These days, removed from the din of a presidential election, it does seem as though we\u2019re hearing less about those kinds of theories. But they certainly haven\u2019t gone away (see: QAnon). To find out what\u2019s circulating right now on the dark corners of the internet, we reached out to the technology columnist Kevin Roose, our resident conspiracy theory expert and one of the people working on The Times\u2019s effort to identify political disinformation. Here\u2019s what he told us: If you spot a piece of political disinformation online, let us know. ____________________ The billionaire investor and Democratic activist Tom Steyer is directing his political operation to get involved in five additional House races in Florida, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. All five districts \u2014 Florida\u2019s 15th, Florida\u2019s 16th, Florida\u2019s 25th, Pennsylvania\u2019s 16th and Wisconsin\u2019s Sixth \u2014 are considered Republican-leaning. Mr. Steyer\u2019s investment is a sign that Democrats see opportunities to tilt those districts. Worth noting: They\u2019re all in battleground presidential states, places where building out an operation of fired-up Democratic volunteers could pay long-term dividends. (Mr. Steyer himself hasn\u2019t ruled out a presidential bid.) He has committed to spending $120 million to help Democrats win the House \u2014 more than any other individual in Democratic politics. His sizable political operation includes efforts to engage young voters, promote clean energy and impeach President Trump.

(The briefings, an almost-daily occurrence in previous administrations, have nearly vanished in the Trump era.) Here were the highlights: Most of the questions were Kavanaugh-related. The confirmation of Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh is the biggest story in Washington, and President Trump\u2019s rally last night \u2014 in which he mocked Christine Blasey Ford \u2014 is still reverberating. Ms. Sanders\u2019s answers revealed bit of the president\u2019s strategy in framing the issue. On who is to blame: \u201cThis entire process has been a disgrace, and the only reason that it\u2019s been that way is because Senate Democrats didn\u2019t do this the way that it should have been done and they circumvented the entire system. And, frankly, they\u2019ve undermined our entire judicial branch.\u201d On who the victims are: \u201cI think both Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh are victims at the hands of the Democrats.\u201d On last night\u2019s rally: \u201cThe president was stating facts.\u201d (By our count, she used the word \u201cfacts\u201d 19 times in discussing the nomination.) She was no fan of The Times\u2019s investigation. \u201cI\u2019m not going to sit and go through every single line of a very boring 14,000-word story,\u201d she said, when asked about the 18-month investigative project The Times debuted yesterday, which uncovered a history of tax fraud in the Trump family business. She did not list any details that were inaccurate. And about those tax returns... Reporter: \u201cAre the president\u2019s taxes still under audit?\u201d Ms. Sanders: \u201cI know that a number of his taxes are still under audit.\u201d Reporter: \u201cAre those ones from the \u201990s and early 2000s, are those as well?\u201d Ms. Sanders: \u201cI\u2019d have to check and get back to you.\u201d Reporter: \u201cWould the White House be willing to provide any of his tax returns?\u201d Ms. Sanders: \u201cI\u2019m not aware of any plans to do so.\u201d ____________________ \u2022 The Times collected remarkable images of the devastation left by the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami.

      "author": "Jonathan Martin",
      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 The stunning defeat on Tuesday of Representative Joseph Crowley, the fourth-ranking House Democrat and a potential future speaker, threw the future of the septuagenarian-led caucus into chaos, opening the door to a new generation of leadership and a push leftward. As shock in the capital over Mr. Crowley\u2019s New York primary loss to a 28-year-old first-time candidate, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, gave way to calculation, House Democrats began floating challengers to Representative Nancy Pelosi, their leader. The current leadership slate reacted defensively to the threat of a purge, while a handful of other lawmakers braced for their own primary challenges from the left. Ms. Pelosi dismissed questions about the growing appetite in her ranks for new leaders, and the demand from the party base for more liberal representatives. \u201cWell, I\u2019m female, I\u2019m progressive \u2014 what\u2019s your problem?\u201d she said. \u201cTwo out of three ain\u2019t bad.\u201d But rank-and-file House Democrats made clear in dozens of interviews that whether the party takes back the majority or not in November, there would be a push to depose Ms. Pelosi, the 78-year-old former speaker. \u201cThere will be an insurgency; I just don\u2019t know who\u2019s leading it,\u201d said Representative Emanuel Cleaver II of Missouri. \u201cBut I can assure you that I am as certain of that as I am that today is Wednesday.\u201d The question of who would lead an insurgency offered Ms. Pelosi some reassurance, but it also raised the threat of the unknown. For over a year, she has known that Mr. Crowley or Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, her 79-year-old second in command and longtime rival, would be her most obvious challengers. Both are white men with roots in the more centrist wing of the party. Now, though, she could face a race from a colleague who is neither white nor male nor particularly moderate, and that could make it easier for her diversity-minded colleagues to latch on. House Democrats suggested a host of challengers, including one veteran lawmaker who commands deep respect in the caucus: Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland. Mr. Cummings said in an interview that he would not challenge Ms. Pelosi, but, notably, he did not bat down the possibility that he would put himself forward should she fail to secure the votes to become speaker or leader. Representative Cheri Bustos of Illinois, who has made a name for herself urging Democrats to redouble their efforts in the Midwest, also did not deny that she is eyeing a top leadership position. \u201cI\u2019m open to making sure that I can make a difference in our caucus,\u201d Ms. Bustos said, adding, \u201cAnd I\u2019ll have some discussions with people about how that may look.\u201d The sheer range of prospective challengers is remarkable: There are women (Ms. Bustos, Debbie Dingell of Michigan and Karen Bass of California), African-Americans (Mr. Cummings, Ms. Bass and Representatives Cedric L. Richmond of Louisiana and Hakeem Jeffries of New York) and a cadre of younger lawmakers (Representatives Tim Ryan of Ohio, Joseph P. Kennedy III of Massachusetts and Eric Swalwell of California). Another possibility being discussed on Wednesday was whether Democrats could ease Ms. Pelosi out by installing a transitional caretaker to serve for two years, when the caucus would pick a new leadership team. Mr. Richmond, who leads the Congressional Black Caucus, said that if Ms. Pelosi did not have the votes to retain her post, he would support Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, the third-ranking Democrat and a veteran African-American, to be the leader for a term. \u201cThis is like throwing a hand grenade in a fish pond and seeing what comes up,\u201d Representative Rick Larsen, Democrat of Washington, said about the leadership jockeying. Mr. Crowley\u2019s loss, he added, \u201cis making a lot of people accelerate their thinking on the leadership races.\u201d Lawmakers are, of course, an ambitious bunch by nature. But the vacuum created by Mr. Crowley\u2019s exit seemed to only deepen the yearning for Ms. Pelosi, Mr. Hoyer and Mr. Clyburn to clear the path for a new generation of leaders. Mr. Clyburn grew testy and admonished a reporter who asked whether he, Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Hoyer could \u201chold on for life.\u201d \u201cI hope you would recognize how late in life I got here, and other people who look like me,\u201d said Mr. Clyburn, 77, the highest-ranking African-American in Congress. He added, \u201cI have a set of experiences and I\u2019m not going to take any lecture from you.\u201d But even some lawmakers who have been supporters of Ms. Pelosi suggested that the caucus must at least consider making a change at the top. \u201cI think that the party has to weigh all alternatives,\u201d Representative Marcy Kaptur of Ohio, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, said before predicting that Ms. Pelosi would \u201chold her own.\u201d Representative Chellie Pingree of Maine said that she had been proud to back Ms. Pelosi in the past but would not commit to doing so again: \u201cI\u2019m going to keep my powder dry like everybody else.\u201d But replacing Ms. Pelosi would not be easy. If the party does reclaim the majority, it will be thanks in large part to the votes of women outraged by President Trump. Under those circumstances, it would be difficult for the caucus to dump the first female House speaker in history and replace her with a man. \u201cIt would absolutely be the wrong time to switch out a woman in leadership for a man, unless he brought some other kind of diversity to leadership,\u201d Ms. Pingree said. Ms. Pelosi is not without her defenders. \u201cI think Pelosi is very strong within our caucus,\u201d said Representative Jim McGovern of Massachusetts, who is in line to become chairman of the powerful Rules Committee if Democrats take back the House. In a meeting at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee on Wednesday morning, Representative Lois Frankel of Florida complained about those Democratic candidates who were threatening Ms. Pelosi\u2019s future by vowing not to support her, suggesting that the campaign arm should not support them, according to a Democratic official familiar with the conversation. (An aide to Ms. Frankel said the congresswoman pledged not to contribute to such candidates personally. She didn\u2019t say the D.C.C.C. should withhold its support.) \u201cLeader Pelosi has always enjoyed the overwhelming support of House Democrats, and that will continue into the majority she\u2019s so focused on winning,\u201d said Drew Hammill, a top aide to Ms. Pelosi. \u201cThe leader is not here on a shift, she\u2019s on a mission.\u201d If Democrats fail to take back the majority, Ms. Pelosi, who has been her party\u2019s leader for over 15 years, would almost certainly be replaced. But if they do capture the chamber, her fate may be determined by just how large their majority is \u2014 and whether the freshman lawmakers who pledged to oppose her follow through on their vow. \u201cThese new members are going to expect to be at the table or at least to have their voices represented at the table,\u201d said Mr. Swalwell, 37. Some of them, like Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, may come to that table having unseated incumbents in primaries. She has refused to commit to Ms. Pelosi, and a handful of other liberal challengers to sitting Democratic lawmakers have done the same. In the aftermath of Mr. Crowley\u2019s defeat, many in the caucus turned their attention to the September primary in Massachusetts, where three women are running against veteran House Democrats, each of them white men. Representative Michael E. Capuano, who represents a minority-majority district in greater Boston, is seen as the most at risk of the three as he confronts a challenge from Ayanna Pressley, a black Boston City Council member who as of April had raised over $363,000. But Representative Stephen F. Lynch, who is facing a primary from Brianna Wu, a computer programmer, and Representative Richard E. Neal are also hoping to avoid Mr. Crowley\u2019s fate. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that the Trump presidency has roiled political waters everywhere,\u201d said Mr. Neal, who is seeking his 16th term and is facing Tahirah Amatul-Wadud, an African-American lawyer.",

Not in Delaware, as Carper Rebuffs Outsider\u2019s BidTom Carper, Delaware\u2019s longtime senator, fended off a challenge from Kerri Evelyn Harris, a political newcomer calling for resistance and changeBy Jonathan MartinPRINT EDITIONCarper Stops Democratic Insurgent in Delaware |September 7, 2018, Page A21",
      "author": "Jonathan Martin",
      "content": " Senator Tom Carper of Delaware fended off a primary challenge from his left on Thursday, easily dispatching a political newcomer, Kerri Evelyn Harris, in the latest test of strength between Democratic insurgents and the party establishment. The most successful statewide politician in Delaware history, Mr. Carper won renomination for a fourth Senate term and what will likely be his 14th consecutive general election victory. He had about 65 percent of the vote with all of the precincts reporting. \u201cWe need to unite as a party,\u201d Mr. Carper told supporters in Wilmington Thursday night. \u201cWe need to keep in mind that we\u2019re not one another\u2019s enemies, we share the same values.\u201d His deep connections in the state he has served since 1976 \u2014 as treasurer, at-large congressman, governor and senator \u2014 were enough for victory. But Mr. Carper, 71, had to work hard for the right to seek what he suggested could be his last term. Declaring that the incumbent\u2019s moderate and consensus-oriented politics were out of step with today\u2019s Democratic Party, and insufficient to meet the challenges of the Trump era, Ms. Harris, 38, pushed Mr. Carper to the left. He expressed regret for voting to confirm Brett M. Kavanaugh to a circuit court judgeship, offered his support for decriminalizing marijuana and amplified his criticism of President Trump. An Air Force veteran-turned-activist, Ms. Harris, 38, sought to tap into the same anti-establishment energy on the left that propelled successful congressional challengers such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New York and Ayanna Pressley in Boston to victory over incumbents. She campaigned on universal health care and raising the minimum wage to $15, and she lashed Mr. Carper for his pro-business posture and willingness to accommodate Delaware\u2019s financial services and pharmaceutical industries. But Ms. Harris did not draw the same amount of attention, locally or nationally, and she raised only about $140,000. Her loss illustrates the difficulty of scaling up primary challenges in statewide races where there is not the sort of readily available coalition \u2014 a mix of people of color and younger white progressives \u2014 that has lifted other Democratic insurgents this year. While Delaware has a modest black population, it is not a hub for liberal white millennials. But the success of candidates like Ms. Pressley and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez was clearly on the mind of Mr. Carper. Since his first race in 1976 he had relied on a mix of affability and political pragmatism to find success \u2014 13 victories in 13 statewide races \u2014 in one of the country\u2019s most lightly populated states. He raised more than $3.5 million, airing commercials trumpeting his achievements for Delaware and boasting of all the miles he put on his Town & Country minivan \u2014 but also reminding voters of his opposition to Mr. Trump and polarizing cabinet figures such as Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. And Mr. Carper enlisted his friend and former colleague, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., to record a radio ad and automated call on his behalf. Most of all, he relied on the relationships he has built up in the \u201cstate of neighbors,\u201d as Delaware politicians call it, a place small enough \u2014 with a population of about 960,000, ranking it 45th among all states \u2014 where a veteran figure like Mr. Carper can personally meet a sizable number of voters, and an even larger share of the primary electorate. Mr. Carper is all but certain to defeat the Republican nominee, Sussex County councilman Rob Arlett, in November. Even as he won the right to serve a fourth term, though, Mr. Carper suggested he was puzzled by the competing demands he was hearing from Delaware voters. \u201cI go around the state and I hear two messages: Number one is, why can\u2019t you guys in Washington find a way to work together like we do here in Delaware?\u201d he said after the Labor Day parade in Wilmington Monday.  \u201cBut the other message is: This guy Trump is no good and you should oppose him with everything you can.\u201d For a self-declared political centrist, it may have been jarring, and Mr. Carper wondered out loud whether there was \u201croom for us in the middle.\u201d Ms. Harris argued that the party had passed him by, that his moderate and cautious politics were outdated at a time when the left is ascendant in the national Democratic Party. Running in a state that has elected a long line of officials who hover between the center-left and center-right, most of them white men, Ms. Harris said Delaware needed a candidate with \u201ca diversity of experience.\u201d A biracial lesbian who noted she had worked in mostly male-dominated jobs, she called herself \u201ca whole lot of otherness.\u201d While acknowledging she was facing a steep climb because of Mr. Carper\u2019s financial advantage, Ms. Harris argued she was \u201cchanging the definition of what viability means in a campaign\u201d by virtue of the volunteers she had signed up. \u201cViability used to mean a whole bunch of money,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, at least here in the state of Delaware, it means a whole bunch of people.\u201d Her challenge irritated some elements of the state\u2019s Democratic establishment who worried that it presaged an incipient tea party of the left. But other Delaware Democrats said there was an upside to the competition. \u201cMaybe Carper needed a little bit of a kick in order to say, \u2018Hey, I\u2019ve really got to do things and pay attention,\u2019\u201d said Paul Thornburg, the second-ranking official with the state Teamsters.",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 At least 19 Immigration and Customs Enforcement investigators are seeking to dissolve the agency, concerned that the Trump administration\u2019s crackdown on illegal migrants has limited their ability to pursue national security threats, child pornography and transnational crime. In a letter sent last week to Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, the special agents proposed creating a stand-alone investigations unit and another agency to handle immigration detention and deportation. The request was sent as a growing number of Democrats and immigration-rights advocates have called for eliminating ICE. Investigations \u201chave been perceived as targeting undocumented aliens, instead of the transnational criminal organizations that facilitate cross border crimes impacting our communities and national security,\u201d wrote the agents from Homeland Security Investigations, which is a branch of ICE. The Texas Observer first reported the letter. The investigators said local law enforcement officials have questioned the independence of their agency, given the Trump administration\u2019s aggressive policies against illegal immigration \u2014 including arresting undocumented workers for minor offenses, such as driving without a license. At least two House Democrats \u2014 Representatives Mark Pocan of Wisconsin and Pramila Jayapal of Washington \u2014 are pushing to eliminate ICE. And Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who stunned the Democratic establishment this week with her upstart primary victory against Representative Joe Crowley of New York, made abolishing ICE one of the key planks of her campaign. An agency spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment on Thursday. But a senior ICE official said there were \u201coperational challenges raised in that letter that merit some discussion.\u201d Homeland Security Investigations is one of several divisions within ICE \u2014 the best-known of which is Enforcement and Removal Operations, which arrests, detains and deports undocumented immigrants. The agents\u2019 letter is rooted in longstanding tensions between the investigative and deportation divisions within ICE. The child of a forced marriage between two defunct federal agencies \u2014 The United States Customs Service and the Immigration and Naturalization Service \u2014 ICE has long struggled to balance its dual roles of transnational criminal investigations and deportations. Some agents in the investigations unit have said the Trump administration has prioritized ICE\u2019s deportations mission. Thomas D. Homan, the acting director of ICE and former leader of its deportation unit, has been a vocal proponent of the administration\u2019s immigration policies. The more than 6,000 special agents assigned to Homeland Security Investigations focus on money laundering, drug trafficking, human smuggling, child exploitation and cybercrimes. The agents have been involved in some of the highest-profile criminal investigations in recent years, including the takedown of the Silk Road website, an online market where illegal drugs and fake identifications were sold. The agency was also involved in the arrest and capture of drug lord Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n Loera, better known as \u201cEl Chapo, who led the Sinaloa cartel before he was extradited to the United States last year. H.S.I. is also the lead government agency for counter proliferation investigations, targeting individuals who illegally try to smuggle military and other high-tech equipment out of the country. The division has about 50 offices around the world.",

Here are some of the stories making news in Washington and politics today. _____________________ \u2022 President Trump was expected to sign a  spending bill funding the government through September, which does not include money for his long-promised border wall. But he still intends to build the wall \u2014 by declaring a national emergency to bypass Congress, the White House announced on Thursday. \u2022 The former F.B.I. deputy director Andrew McCabe said that Justice Department officials, alarmed by Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to fire James Comey in May 2017, had discussed using the 25th Amendment to remove the president from office. \u2022 To accommodate an already sprawling field of candidates, the first Democratic presidential primary debates will be split across two consecutive nights, the Democratic National Committee said. \u2022 The Senate confirmed William P. Barr as attorney general. He will take over the Justice Department at a critical moment, with the special counsel\u2019s Russia investigation said to be wrapping up. \u2022 The federal debt ticked past $22 trillion this week \u2014 a record, despite continued economic growth. Neither major party appears to be making debt reduction a priority. \u2022 The Trump Organization gave up indefinitely on plans for two new hotel chains, blaming a political climate in which, as Eric Trump put it, \u201ceverything will be used against us.\u201d \u2022 Taxpayers are angry about getting smaller tax refunds this year, following the 2017 Republican tax cuts. The Treasury Department explained that taxpayers received most of their cut in the form of bigger paychecks last year. \u2022 Since Mr. Trump announced that he would pull American troops from Syria, other countries have signaled a willingness to take back their citizens who joined the Islamic State and are now detained in makeshift camps. \u2022 Former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis was viewed by American allies as a reassuring brake on Mr. Trump. But NATO does not see the current acting secretary, Patrick Shanahan, as an effective counterweight to the president\u2019s distrust of the alliance. \u2022 Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York has inspired a wave of Democratic Party insurgents to challenge as many as a half-dozen established members of Congress in and around New York City in 2020. \u2022 Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota confronted Elliott Abrams, the Trump administration\u2019s envoy to Venezuela, over his role in foreign policy scandals decades ago, including the Iran-contra affair and the United States\u2019 support of brutal leaders. \u2022 Mr. Trump\u2019s medical records were released by the White House physician, Dr. Sean Conley.

      "content": "Good Tuesday morning. Here are some of the stories making news in Washington and politics today. _____________________ \u2022 When 20 Democratic presidential candidates gather for the second round of debates, about half of them will do so with the understanding that it will probably be their last time on the national stage this election cycle. Short of a breakout moment that charges fund-raising,  many are in danger of missing the qualifying threshold for the next round of debates. \u2022 Tonight\u2019s debate will place the race\u2019s two liberal front-runners, Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, center stage. Here are more matchups to look out for. \u2022 Joe Biden\u2019s halting performance at the June debate has stirred unease among some Democrats about his age. They are looking for reassurance from his next debate on Wednesday. \u2022 As candidates prepare for the debates, Senator Kamala Harris is setting up a showdown, hoping to control the narrative around her new health care plan, one that uses the \u201cMedicare for all\u201d mantra as a long-term target while also seeking to keep a significant role for private insurers. \u2022 Teaming up with Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ms. Harris released another plan this week: a climate equity plan that would prioritize low-income communities. \u2022 Ms. Warren, Pete Buttigieg and five other Democratic presidential candidates have pledged to make an anti-corruption bill their first legislation as president. \u2022 President Trump, after a weekend spent assailing Representative Elijah Cummings, a leading African-American congressman from Baltimore, widened his war on critics of color on Monday morning as he denounced the Rev. Al Sharpton as \u201ca con man\u201d who \u201cHates Whites & Cops!\u201d \u2022 Baltimore residents know their city has deep problems. But they say Mr. Trump\u2019s race-baiting insults are not going to help. \u2022 Trade talks between the U.S. and China resumed Monday with prospects dimming for a transformative deal. Both sides seem more focused on preventing tensions from escalating before the 2020 presidential election than on resolving their differences, and officials are playing down the likelihood of an agreement. \u2022 Attorney General William Barr moved to end asylum protections for migrants solely because their relatives have been persecuted, the latest attempt by the Trump administration to limit sanctuary for people seeking refuge in the U.S. \u2022 Mr. Trump\u2019s pick for director of national intelligence, Representative John Ratcliffe, could face an uphill battle, Senate Republicans said. Democrats and former officials also expressed concern that Mr. Ratcliffe will politicize what is supposed to be a nonpartisan job. _____________________ Today\u2019s On Politics briefing was compiled by Isabella Grull\u00f3n Paz in New York.

      "author": "Maggie Astor",
      "content": " Tuesday is another busy voting day, with Kansas, Michigan, Missouri and Washington holding primaries and one Ohio district holding a special House election. We\u2019ll have live results beginning Tuesday evening. Here\u2019s a look at the most important races. Voters in Ohio\u2019s 12th District will choose a replacement for Representative Pat Tiberi, a Republican who resigned to work for a business group. The candidates are Troy Balderson, a Republican endorsed last week by President Trump, and Danny O\u2019Connor, a Democrat. The race is expected to be close, and both national parties are spending heavily. But whoever loses will get a rematch in the regularly scheduled election in just three months. Read more about what\u2019s at stake here. We\u2019ll have live results here from Ohio. At the top of the ballot here is the race for governor, a job held by Jeff Colyer since the former governor Sam Brownback accepted an ambassadorship under Mr. Trump. Mr. Colyer is running against Secretary of State Kris Kobach, the face of Mr. Trump\u2019s voter fraud commission, in the Republican primary. In a dynamic that has become very familiar this year, each man wants to be known as the most loyal and effective ally of the president. Mr. Kobach, a firebrand on immigration as well as voting laws, resembles the president in tone and style, leaving Mr. Colyer to argue that he is a pragmatist who will more effectively accomplish Trumpian policy goals. Mr. Trump endorsed Mr. Kobach on Monday. Also running are three Democrats: Carl Brewer, a former mayor of Wichita; Laura Kelly, a state senator; and Joshua Svaty, a farmer and former state agriculture secretary. Some Democrats think that if Mr. Kobach wins the Republican nomination, it could give them an opening among voters who see him as too extreme. Read more about that possibility here. Finally, voters will be choosing their candidates in two Republican-held House districts that Democrats hope to flip in November. Seven Republicans are on the ballot in the Second District, where Representative Lynn Jenkins is retiring; the winner will face Paul Davis, a Democrat who won the district during his unsuccessful bid for governor in 2014. And in the Third District, which includes Democratic-leaning Kansas City and Overland Park, six Democrats are vying to challenge Representative Kevin Yoder. We\u2019ll have live results here from Kansas. Four Republicans and three Democrats are running for governor here, a wide-open race since Gov. Rick Snyder has reached his term limit. On the Republican side, the top contenders appear to be Attorney General Bill Schuette and Lt. Gov. Brian Calley. On the Democratic side, the candidates are the former State Senator Gretchen Whitmer; Shri Thanedar, a businessman; and Abdul El-Sayed, a progressive former director of the Detroit Health Department. Meanwhile, two businessmen are running in a Republican primary to challenge Senator Debbie Stabenow, a three-term Democratic incumbent who is running for re-election. This is yet another race in which the candidates are jockeying for the Trump vote, and Mr. Trump weighed in late last month, endorsing John James over Sandy Pensler. A poll conducted shortly before the endorsement showed an extremely close race, but Mr. Trump\u2019s support could give Mr. James the edge. Five House races in Michigan are also expected to be competitive in November, especially the Republican-held Eighth and 11th Districts. In the Eighth District, two Democrats \u2014 Elissa Slotkin and Chris Smith \u2014 are vying to challenge Representative Mike Bishop. And in the 11th District, where Representative David Trott is retiring, there are crowded primary fields on both sides. Keep an eye, too, on the 13th District, where Representative John Conyers Jr. resigned last year because of sexual harassment allegations. It\u2019s a safe Democratic seat, but the primary is hard-fought. Read more about the candidates in that race here. We\u2019ll have live results here from Michigan. Senator Claire McCaskill is believed to be one of the most vulnerable Democrats in the Senate because of her low approval rating and Mr. Trump\u2019s victory in Missouri by nearly 20 percentage points. Six years ago, she managed to win re-election largely because of the deep unpopularity of her Republican opponent, Todd Akin, who drew national ridicule and condemnation for claiming that women did not get pregnant in cases of \u201clegitimate rape.\u201d This time, Republicans are hoping to nominate a stronger challenger. The front-runner is Josh Hawley, Missouri\u2019s conservative attorney general, for whom Mr. Trump has raised funds and campaigned; his long-shot opponent is Austin Petersen, a libertarian. Polls show an extremely close race between Mr. Hawley and Ms. McCaskill. In the First Congressional District, Cori Bush is running against an incumbent Democrat, William Lacy Clay, in a test of whether the progressive playbook pioneered by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New York can work in the heartland. Read more about that race here. Voters will also weigh in on a ballot measure that will determine whether Missouri becomes a right-to-work state, meaning that people would no longer have to join a union or pay fees if their workplaces are unionized. Republicans passed right-to-work legislation in 2017, but labor groups collected enough signatures to prevent the measure from taking effect pending a statewide ballot. We\u2019ll have live results here from Missouri. Two of Washington\u2019s 10 congressional districts have competitive races on Tuesday. The primaries will be \u201ctop two,\u201d meaning that \u2014 as in California \u2014 the top two finishers will move on to the general election, regardless of party. In the Eighth District, four main candidates are running to replace Representative David Reichert, a retiring Republican whose seat is considered a tossup this year. Former State Senator Dino Rossi, a Republican, is expected to finish comfortably in the top two in the primary. The big question is which Democrat will make it along with him: Shannon Hader, a former official at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; Jason Rittereiser, a lawyer; or Kim Schrier, a pediatrician. In the solidly Democratic Ninth District, Representative Adam Smith, a longtime congressman with a top position on the House Armed Services Committee, is facing a primary challenge from Sarah Smith, a democratic socialist. On the surface, this looks a lot like New York\u2019s 14th District, where another democratic socialist, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, beat Joseph Crowley, a longtime congressman with a powerful leadership position. Ms. Smith has encouraged the comparison, while Mr. Smith has emphasized the differences between the two races \u2014 including the fact that Ms. Ocasio-Cortez was born and raised in her district, while Ms. Smith lives just outside this one. We\u2019ll have live results here from Washington.",

The decision appears to be a political calculation that staying tough on China will be a better proposition in the 2020 campaign. \u2022 Chinese intelligence agents acquired hacking tools developed by the National Security Agency and repurposed them to attack American allies and private companies in Europe and Asia, raising questions about the United States\u2019 expensive and dangerous digital arsenal. \u2022 The House Judiciary Committee has set a Wednesday vote to hold Attorney General William P. Barr in contempt of Congress after he failed to turn over an unredacted Mueller report. \u2022 Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to brand the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization was the latest foreign policy decision that appears to have been heavily influenced by autocratic leaders without first being fully vetted by career officials. \u2022 New threats by Iran against American troops in Iraq were behind the sudden deployment of forces to the Persian Gulf. The White House and Pentagon made the decision after seeing intelligence that showed new activity on the part of Iran. \u2022 Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez will headline a rally next week in Washington for the Green New Deal, as she seeks to shore up support for the expansive climate legislation that has been met with skepticism by members of both parties. \u2022 In style and substance, the opening days of Joe Biden\u2019s presidential run are giving some Democrats flashbacks to Hillary Clinton\u2019s unsuccessful 2016 campaign. \u2022 Senator Cory Booker rolled out a broad gun-control plan on Monday, saying he was \u201csick and tired of hearing thoughts and prayers for the communities that have been shattered by gun violence.\u201d The program calls for fingerprints, a background check and a certified gun safety course. \u2022 Mr. Trump awarded Tiger Woods with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation\u2019s highest civilian honor.

      "author": "Jonathan Martin",
      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 The pitched battle looming over the Supreme Court, along with a jolt to the Democratic leadership at the ballot box last Tuesday, is threatening to shatter the already fragile architecture of the Democratic Party, as an activist rebellion on the left and a lurch to the right in Washington propels the party toward a moment of extraordinary conflict and forced reinvention. For Democrats, the transformation could prove as consequential as President Trump\u2019s consolidation of power in his own party and the conservative movement\u2019s tightening grip on the federal government. \u201cThe Trump presidency has changed the dynamics in our party,\u201d said Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the second-ranking Democrat in the Senate, acknowledging that he could not recall a similar grass-roots uprising since he was elected to Congress in 1982. The party\u2019s traditional leaders absorbed one blow after another last week. Representative Joseph Crowley, a 20-year incumbent and potential future House speaker, was unseated by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a 28-year-old Latina political newcomer; Congress made clear it cannot pass even a limited immigration measure for the children of undocumented immigrants; and the Supreme Court handed down rulings that undermined the labor unions that are a backbone of the Democratic Party, while also limiting abortion rights advocacy and upholding President Trump\u2019s travel ban. And then Justice Anthony M. Kennedy announced his retirement, effectively handing Mr. Trump the opportunity to cement a conservative majority on the bench. Mr. Trump\u2019s divisive and at times demagogic presidency has ignited much of the liberal upheaval, driving many left-of-center voters on to a kind of ideological war footing. That has translated into a surge in outsider candidates in the midterms who are pressuring Democratic leaders to support an ambitious liberal platform that includes single-payer health care, free college tuition and the abolition of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. But this insurgency, which is both encouraging and alarming Democratic officials, is not merely aimed at pushing the party farther left ideologically. There is a deeper divide over how far to go in confronting Mr. Trump and attempting to thwart his agenda. At a strategy session held over lunch last week, Senate Democrats settled on a careful strategy for the coming Supreme Court confirmation battle. They would drop their demands that Republicans not appoint a replacement for Mr. Kennedy until after the midterm elections, senators decided, and instead would highlight the threat to abortion rights and health care to try to mobilize opposition to Mr. Trump\u2019s appointment. \u201cI\u2019m sure many of them believe we have the power to stop this,\u201d Mr. Durbin said of the expectations his party\u2019s enraged base for Democrats blocking the court pick. \u201cBut the grim reality is that we have some power but not the power to stop this.\u201d But a few hours later, on the ground floor of the Hart Senate Office Building, nearly 600 women clad in suffragist white were arrested in a demonstration against the separation of migrant children from their parents \u2014 and they said they wanted their senators to do nothing less than lie down on the tracks to stop Mr. Trump\u2019s nomination. \u201cI want to see this Congress actually follow our lead and resist in a real way,\u201d said Winnie Wong, one of the organizers of the sit-in. \u201cThis kind of resistance can create a blockade and stop what will be a fast-track appointment. Imagine a world where you had the chamber do a civil disobedience, what that would that look like.\u201d With former President Barack Obama evincing little appetite to reclaim a leadership role and no clear 2020 presidential front-runner, Democrats lack a commanding figure to oversee strategy and help bridge the internal fissures in the party. And while relentless confrontation with the White House and noisy protests might animate the rising Democratic coalition, they will not lead to success at the polls if the party cannot harness the fury. \u201cThe key is translating these public demonstrations and marches into electoral activism and then government activism,\u201d said Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, a Democrat. The tumult also extends to how Democrats should set themselves apart from the right. On the activist left, there is a deep hunger to wean Democrats away from their ties to corporate America, one of Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s clarion calls. There are also rising demands that leaders encourage, and even participate in, the sort of extreme measures of confrontation that took place on the floor of the Hart building and have been on display restaurants where Trump aides have been shouted down while dining. Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader who is facing a growing revolt in her own caucus, was sharply criticized on the left when she denounced such tactics. And as the Democratic National Committee moves to eliminate superdelegates \u2014 the elected officials and party elites who help determine presidential nominees \u2014 there is widespread expectation that traditional power brokers should cede more authority to the activists on social media, often millennials and people of color, who are increasingly steering the party\u2019s agenda. \u201cWe have to pay attention to our base,\u201d said Representative Pramila Jayapal of Washington, who was the only lawmaker arrested at the immigration protest last week. Pointing to a series of special elections and primaries, including Mr. Crowley\u2019s, that she said showed a rising liberal coalition flexing its power, Ms. Jayapal added, \u201cThat energy, combined with the real threat of a second Supreme Court justice that could strip away women\u2019s reproductive rights and a lot of other rights that people have come to rely on \u2014 I think it is an even bigger call to action.\u201d The turmoil on the left mirrors that of Republicans in the first two years of Mr. Obama\u2019s administration, when Democrats controlled all the levers of government and left the Tea Party-inflected Republican Party to thrash around in impotent protest, raging with an energy that eventually propelled it back to power. But some Democrats see the moment in even more sweeping terms, akin to the era following the Vietnam War and Watergate, when the reaction to a controversial Republican president triggered a moderate and liberal backlash. That movement delivered dozens of new seats, but it also unleashed a generational changing of the guard that jolted party leaders. Former Senator Gary Hart of Colorado, elected in the Democratic wave of 1974 and a leader in the effort to reinvent the Democratic Party in the 1980s, said Democrats were approaching an overdue moment of reckoning with their own limitations. The party, he said, had failed for years to define a forward-looking vision. The pressure of the midterm election \u2014 heightened, he said, by the Supreme Court vacancy \u2014 could create a new moment of definition. \u201cThere almost has to be a generational renewal of belief systems,\u201d said Mr. Hart, a two-time presidential candidate, who is now 81. \u201cWhen we were in power, under Obama and Clinton, I don\u2019t believe party leaders did what should have been done, and that is come up with a manifesto for the 21st century.\u201d Mr. Hart said Democratic voters were plainly hunting for fresh inspiration. \u201cThere are fountains of energy all over the place,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a big searchlight going on right now for the next generation of leadership in this country.\u201d What worries some Democratic elders, though, is that activists will harbor unrealistic expectations of what sort of policies newly elected progressive lawmakers can push through in a still-divided capital. \u201cThey say to new members, \u2018You won because of us,\u2019\u201d said John A. Lawrence, former chief of staff to Ms. Pelosi and the author of a new book on the so-called Watergate Babies. \u201cActually no, typically you win because you were able to win moderate voters disgusted with incumbents.\u201d There is also a group of younger Democrats uneasy about the party drifting too far left. Representative Cedric Richmond of Louisiana said he understood that Democratic voters were \u201cfurious and scared at the same time,\u201d but he also said he wished his party had a moderating influence to counter Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the democratic socialist who has been at the front end of the party\u2019s turn left. \u201cBernie is fighting for his principles on what direction the party should go,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we don\u2019t really have anybody doing it on behalf of moderates and other Democrats. It has become a one-sided conversation.\u201d There is no question that Democratic leaders have been tugged toward a brand of more unadulterated progressivism. But there are fewer levers of power at their disposal to impose discipline or tilt their proposals toward the political center. They lack legislative earmarks to hand out, or withhold, and their ability to raise large sums of money matters less in an era in which liberal fund-raising is moving online. And with the decline of unions, one of the last pillars of top-down authority in their coalition is on the wane. The public-sector unions stung by last week\u2019s court decision had been one the movement\u2019s remaining power centers. For Democrats in Washington, the process of renewal could be a painful one. Across much of the left, Mr. Crowley\u2019s defeat was welcomed as readily as if he had been a Republican, rather than a conventional machine Democrat. And Ms. Ocasio-Cortez has embraced the insurgent\u2019s mantle, vowing to help other liberal upstarts and even endorsing other challengers to Democratic incumbents. One of those challengers, Ayanna Pressley, a member of the Boston City Council who is aiming to oust Representative Michael E. Capuano, a long-serving liberal, said the party\u2019s base had been in a fighting mood for months. But the combination of Mr. Trump\u2019s provocations, the Supreme Court\u2019s lurch and the insurrection in Queens has rocked liberals to the core, she said. \u201cThe party and our democracy are at a crossroads,\u201d Ms. Pressley said, adding matter-of-factly, \u201cThese times require disruption.\u201d At least one veteran Democrat has gotten the message: Mr. Capuano. Last week, in the aftermath of Mr. Crowley\u2019s loss, the Massachusetts lawmaker began circulating a memo highlighting his differences with his soon-to-be-former colleague. \u201cCapuano Is a Strong, Proud Progressive,\u201d the memo reads. \u201cCrowley Is a Moderate.\u201d",

      "author": "Karen Zraick",
      "content": " There were historic firsts across the country on Tuesday night, as voters chose from a set of candidates that was among the most diverse ever to run in the United States. Native American, Muslim and African-American women, and L.G.B.T. candidates, were among those who broke barriers. Here are some of the winners who made history. (See election results for the House of Representatives, the Senate and governors\u2019 races.) In next year\u2019s session of Congress, there will be at least 100 women in the House for the first time in history. Sharice Davids, a former White House fellow from Kansas, and Debra Haaland, a community activist from New Mexico. Ms. Davids is also the first lesbian Native American to be elected to the House and part of \u201ca rainbow wave\u201d of L.G.B.T. candidates in this year\u2019s election. She has criticized the Republican tax bill and called for \u201ca true tax cut for the middle class.\u201d [More openly L.G.B.T. people were elected Tuesday night than in any previous election.] In her contest, Ms. Haaland drew parallels between the separation of Native American children and the federal government\u2019s recent border actions with the families of migrants. Ilhan Omar, a Democratic state legislator in Minnesota, and Rashida Tlaib, a Democratic former state legislator in Michigan, became the first Muslim women elected to Congress after winning their House races. Ms. Omar will also be the first Somali-American to serve in Congress. She has called for gun control, single-payer health care and a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. Ms. Tlaib, a Palestinian-American attorney, has championed Medicare for All, a $15 minimum wage and abolishing the federal agency Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Ayanna Pressley will become the first African-American woman to represent Massachusetts in Congress. She beat a 10-term incumbent in the Democratic primary and vowed to pursue \u201cactivist leadership\u201d to advance a progressive agenda. Jahana Hayes, a school district administrator in Waterbury, Conn., will become the first African-American woman to represent Connecticut in Congress. Ms. Hayes, a Democrat, was a celebrated former history teacher who was chosen as the National Teacher of the Year in 2016. She will fill the seat previously held by Elizabeth Esty, a Democrat who said she had failed to protect women in her office from sexual harassment and did not seek re-election. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, 29, became the youngest woman elected to Congress. Like Ms. Pressley, she defeated a white male incumbent who had served 10 terms in a Democratic primary. She will represent New York\u2019s 14th District, which includes parts of Queens and the Bronx. She has never held elected office but attracted support with an uncompromising left-wing platform. She won about 78 percent of the vote against her little-known Republican opponent. Two Democratic women in Texas, Veronica Escobar of El Paso and Sylvia Garcia of Houston, will be the state\u2019s first Latinas to serve in the House of Representatives. Their victories, both in seats previously held by Democrats, reflect the shifting demographics in Texas, particularly in urban areas. Ms. Escobar, a top elected official in El Paso County, will replace Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke, whose spirited challenge for Senate against Ted Cruz fell short on Tuesday night. Ms. Garcia was a member of the Texas Senate. Marsha Blackburn, a Republican congresswoman closely allied with President Trump, will be Tennessee\u2019s first female senator. She is fiercely anti-abortion, and stressed border security and taxes. Mr. Trump visited Tennessee to campaign for Ms. Blackburn three times, most recently at a rally in Chattanooga on Sunday. Kyrsten Sinema, a three-term Democratic congresswoman, will be the first female senator of Arizona \u2014 and the first openly bisexual senator in the country. She started off as a Green Party activist in the early 2000s, but moved to the political center after she was elected to the state legislature. Jared Polis, a wealthy Democratic congressman in Colorado, became the first openly gay man elected as governor in any state. He wants to push for single-payer health care and renewable energy. Kristi Noem, a four-term Republican congresswoman who touted her experience working on her family\u2019s farm and her conservative record in office, will be the first female governor of South Dakota. Vice President Mike Pence campaigned for her at a rally in Rapid City on Monday night. Janet Mills, the Democratic state attorney general of Maine, will be its first female governor. (She was also the first woman elected as the state\u2019s attorney general.) The former prosecutor was elected to the state legislature in 2002, and has vowed to combat the opioid epidemic and ensure access to health care. Lourdes Leon Guerrero, a successful bank executive in Guam and a Democrat, became the first female governor of the small United States territory in the Pacific. She was part of a wave of female candidates who won there on Tuesday, including 10 women elected to the 15-member Guam Legislature.",

But They\u2019re Not Friends.|December 14, 2018, Page A19",
      "author": "Sheryl Gay Stolberg",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 In her quest to become speaker, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California appears ready once again to sacrifice the higher ambitions of her No. 2, Representative Steny H. Hoyer, and Mr. Hoyer is not shy about expressing his objections. \u201cShe\u2019s not negotiating for me,\u201d he snapped the other day, referring to Ms. Pelosi\u2019s deal with a group of House Democratic rebels to impose term limits on the leadership \u2014 and not just herself \u2014 of four years. As Democrats prepare to assume control of the House, the Pelosi-Hoyer frenemies dynamic, long a subject of intrigue in the Capitol, is growing ever more complex. The friction goes back decades. The last time Democrats took power from Republicans, in 2006, Ms. Pelosi backed then-Representative John P. Murtha in his effort to oust Mr. Hoyer from the majority leader\u2019s slot. The putsch failed spectacularly, but she\u2019s ready to handcuff him again with a deal on term limits that, if approved, would most likely usher both lawmakers from their leadership suites by early 2023, along with the No. 3 Democrat, Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina. All three septuagenarians could be weakened by their lame-duck status \u2014 in Washington, power is always prospective \u2014 but Mr. Hoyer, 79, of Maryland, the lone white man in the group and a symbol of the party\u2019s dwindling centrist wing, would appear to be the most vulnerable to an even earlier challenge. Some see Mr. Hoyer as the ultimate corporate pol, out of sync with a Democratic caucus in which women, millennials and people of color are in ascendance, with the loudest new voices on the left. His longstanding ambitions to be speaker would almost certainly be curtailed by the plan\u2019s emphasis on generational change, though under it, he could technically serve four years as majority leader, and then, at 83, run for speaker. But over his more than 50 years in public life, 37 of them in Congress, Mr. Hoyer has proved himself a quiet survivor. He is now the House\u2019s longest-serving Democrat. Last month, he skated to victory to reclaim the majority leader\u2019s post, even as some fellow Democrats pushed for Ms. Pelosi\u2019s ouster. \u201cIs Tom Brady too old at 41 to be quarterback?\u201d he asked in an interview, comparing himself to one of the best N.F.L. players in history. His survival skills may be put to a new test as he fights back against the term limits proposal, which is subject to a vote of the entire caucus when the new Congress convenes in January. The debate will pit old-school Democrats like Mr. Hoyer, who derive their power from the seniority system, against newcomers, who want to shake things up. \u201cSteny entered the political scene at a time when Democratic Party politics was much more conservative and traditional in how it operated,\u201d said Representative Jamie Raskin, a fellow Maryland Democrat, adding, \u201cOne of the last great challenges of Steny\u2019s career is to figure out how to incorporate the surge in progressive feeling in our party.\u201d Mr. Hoyer\u2019s stock in trade is his ability to cultivate allies across the Democratic spectrum (not to mention lobbyists and donors), and he is busy making new friends on the left. Among them is Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the progressive firebrand from New York, who at 29 is half a century his junior. He dropped in to see her at a cafe in Queens on Halloween, the first time they had met. \u201cI remember feeling very pleasantly surprised,\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said. But while he may have left her with the impression that he will embrace her vow to make waves, in the interview, Mr. Hoyer was more cautious. He took a dim view of Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s decision to join environmental activists at a protest in Ms. Pelosi\u2019s office. \u201cI was a little bit surprised, but you know, she\u2019s gung-ho, she\u2019s full of vim, vigor and vitality,\u201d he said, adding tartly, \u201cOne could say there are other ways to make a point.\u201d Like Ms. Pelosi, Mr. Hoyer raises millions of dollars for Democrats \u2014 more than $10 million in this election cycle alone \u2014 and crisscrosses the country campaigning for them. Unlike her, he has not become the subject of Republican attack ads and is welcome in districts across the country. If Ms. Pelosi is the public face of the caucus, he is the \u201cmember\u2019s member,\u201d guiding younger colleagues on everything from hiring decisions to committee assignments. \u201cHoyer is the old-school pol; everything about him is hail-fellow-well-met,\u201d said Amy Walter, national editor for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. \u201cHe just is so much different than the new generation of leaders. He\u2019s not an outsider, he\u2019s not one who wants to destroy the establishment.\u201d Indeed, the establishment has been friendly to Mr. Hoyer, tall and silver-haired, with a toothy smile and a seemingly endless supply of conservative ties and starched white shirts. Of the more than $4 million he raised this last election cycle, more than $1 million came from large contributions, and nearly $2.5 million came from political action committees, according to Open Secrets, which tracks campaign finance. He opposes Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s call to keep members who take industry contributions off a select committee on climate change, saying the corrupting influence of money in politics can be cured through disclosure. Progressives were up in arms earlier this year when Levi Tillemann, a progressive energy consultant, secretly recorded Mr. Hoyer urging him to quit a House Democratic primary in Colorado to clear a path for a more moderate veteran, Jason Crow, who won the Republican-held seat. Mr. Tillemann\u2019s grandfather was Tom Lantos, a venerated California Democrat who died in 2008 and was extremely close to Mr. Hoyer, and his uncle is Richard Swett, a former Democratic congressman from New Hampshire. \u201cSteny Hoyer,\u201d Mr. Tillemann said in an interview, \u201cis part of a system that is bought and paid for by powerful people, corporations and interests.\u201d Mr. Hoyer makes no apologies. And Mr. Hoyer\u2019s allies see his it\u2019s-not-personal attitude as a virtue. Veronica Escobar, an incoming freshman from Texas, recalled that when Mr. Hoyer agreed to support her, he insisted on breaking the news himself to a friend who was backing her opponent. \u201cIt showed a level of not just courage, but a level of transparency and a desire to be forthright and candid and open and honest,\u201d she said. Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Hoyer go back more than half a century. Having known difficult times \u2014 his biological father left him, and his stepfather was an alcoholic \u2014 Mr. Hoyer was working his way through the University of Maryland as a night file clerk for the C.I.A. when he heard a young Senator John F. Kennedy speak on campus. Inspired, he switched his major from public relations to politics, and ditched the C.I.A. job to work part time for a Democratic senator, Daniel B. Brewster of Maryland. There, in 1963, he crossed paths with a summer intern, Nancy D\u2019Alesandro, soon to be Nancy Pelosi, the daughter of a longtime Baltimore mayor and Maryland Democratic royalty. \u201cShe was bright, beautiful, energetic and a big wheel,\u201d Mr. Hoyer recalled. \u201cShe was a D\u2019Alesandro.\u201d The \u201csomething happened when they were interns\u201d theory of their friction is the stuff of Capitol lore, but Mr. Hoyer dismissed that as \u201cbaloney.\u201d While they were not close, he said they had a \u201cwonderful relationship.\u201d He allowed that they came from very different worlds: \u201cShe ran in different circles than I did.\u201d Four decades later, in 2001, they ran against each other for Democratic whip. Ms. Pelosi won. In an interview, he took pains to note that she had the backing of 30 of the 32 Democrats from her home state of California, while his home state of Maryland had only four Democrats all told. When Ms. Pelosi backed Mr. Murtha in 2006, \u201cI wasn\u2019t happy about it,\u201d Mr. Hoyer said. But he won handily, which seemed to produce a d\u00e9tente. Mr. Raskin said Mr. Hoyer was \u201cvery much at peace with where he is right now,\u201d but Mr. Hoyer is not ruling anything out. Before Ms. Pelosi secured the votes to become speaker, he described himself as \u201cone of the alternatives\u201d should she fall short, and said that \u201cof course\u201d he would one day like to have the job, while adding quickly that he had a pretty amazing job right now. He refused to say whether he would run again or retire in 2020. In the meantime, there is something he would like people to know: \u201cI\u2019m not Nancy\u2019s lieutenant,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m Nancy\u2019s partner.\u201d",

On Jan. 11, CBS News announced it had expanded its political team in preparation for the 2020 presidential campaign. The announcement included a photo of the network\u2019s 12 new presidential campaign reporters and associate producers. There were men and women from a variety of ethnic backgrounds. Asian, Hispanic, Middle Eastern. None of them were black. The National Association of Black Journalists released a statement that said it was \u201cvery disappointed\u201d and \u201cdisturbed.\u201d Representative Maxine Waters of California asked for an \u201cexplanation.\u201d The author Roxane Gay described the whole thing as a \u201cdisgrace.\u201d Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York called it \u201cunacceptable.\u201d I, too, was disappointed by the photo, but I could hardly say I was surprised. Many news organizations are still struggling to diversify their staffs, The New York Times included. I\u2019m a black woman who is an editor in a newsroom. I think it\u2019s important that black people are represented in the editorial process, soup to nuts \u2014 editors, correspondents, producers, photographers, digital, print, you name it. However, as the backlash to the CBS News announcement played out, a question lingered in my mind: If black reporters had been represented, but, say, Asian-Americans or Hispanic-Americans or Muslim-Americans had not, what type of furor would have occurred, if any? Why or why not? I plan to spend more time focused on this question in 2019. CBS News didn\u2019t take any of this lying down, by the way. It clarified that the digital journalists and field reporters included in the photo were part of an \u201cinitial wave\u201d of journalists who would be embedded with 2020 candidates. It also pointed out that Lorna Jones, a black woman, had been promoted to oversee much of the network\u2019s political coverage. It should be said that CBS is in a moment of transition. Susan Zirinsky, who will be the first woman to run CBS News, is taking over from David Rhodes in March. Les Moonves, the former chief executive, stepped down in September following multiple accusations of sexual harassment. All three executives are white. In its statement, the president of the National Association of Black Journalists, Sarah Glover, said it\u2019s unfortunate we\u2019re still talking about diversity and inclusion 50 years after the Kerner Commission, in which the white news media was roundly criticized for failing to report on the rampant disparities faced by African-Americans in the 1960s. \u201cThe halls of Congress have become more diverse and more reflective of our American society,\u201d Ms. Glover said. \u201cIt\u2019s time for U.S. newsrooms to do the same. No excuses.\u201d",

      "author": "Jonathan Martin",
      "content": "   Welcome to The Tip Sheet, a daily political analysis of the 2018 elections, based on interviews with Republican and Democratic officials, pollsters, strategists and voters. MARIETTA, Ga. \u2014 The chant began well before Oprah Winfrey arrived on Thursday: \u201cAnd you get a vote! And you get a vote! And you get a vote!\u201d Ms. Winfrey eventually joined in the cheer, with its origins in her days as a talk-show host \u2014 but only after she delivered a pointed rebuke to people who might willfully forego the franchise and a stirring evocation of her native South\u2019s racist past. \u201cI\u2019m here today because of the men and because of the women who were lynched, who were humiliated, who were discriminated against, who were suppressed, who were repressed and who were oppressed for the right of equality at the polls,\u201d Ms. Winfrey said as she visited Georgia on behalf of Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate for governor. \u201cTheir blood has seeped into my DNA, and I refuse to let their sacrifices be in vain.\u201d [Read what happened when Ms. Winfrey dropped by a voter\u2019s home to campaign for Ms. Abrams.] Not to be outdone, Ms. Abrams\u2019s Republican rival, Brian Kemp, barnstormed the state on Thursday with Vice President Mike Pence. \u201cI heard Oprah\u2019s in town today,\u201d Mr. Pence said at one of his three Thursday rallies for Mr. Kemp. \u201cAnd I heard Will Ferrell was going door-to-door the other day. Well, I\u2019d like to remind Stacey and Oprah and Will Ferrell, I\u2019m kind of a big deal, too.\u201d Mr. Pence, returning to an argument that Republicans have deployed throughout the campaign against Ms. Abrams, added, \u201cI\u2019ve got a message for all of Stacey Abrams\u2019s liberal Hollywood friends: This ain\u2019t Hollywood. This is Georgia.\u201d Although Ms. Winfrey emerged Thursday as a vocal champion for Ms. Abrams and her policies, she focused her most impassioned remarks on voting rights \u2014 a message that could reverberate among her still-devoted fans across the country. \u201cFor anybody here who has an ancestor who didn\u2019t have the right to vote, and you are choosing not to vote \u2014 wherever you are in this state, in this country, you are dishonoring your family,\u201d said Ms. Winfrey, who, like Ms. Abrams, is a black woman who grew up in Mississippi. \u201cYou are disrespecting and disregarding their legacy, their suffering and their dreams when you don\u2019t vote.\u201d Indeed, Ms. Winfrey\u2019s two appearances in the Atlanta area were designed to help Ms. Abrams galvanize support \u2014 and enthusiasm \u2014 among voters she must turn out if she is to win on Tuesday: white women from the suburbs, as well as black women. Together, Ms. Winfrey and Ms. Abrams drew hundreds of them on Thursday. Both Ms. Abrams and Mr. Kemp are hoping to avoid a runoff, but polls show the two effectively tied. A Libertarian candidate is also in the race. Two presidents are still scheduled to campaign in the state: former President Barack Obama is due in Atlanta on Friday, and President Trump will campaign in Macon on Sunday. We\u2019re entering the homestretch, and our just-completed poll in the New Jersey district of Representative Leonard Lance carries ominous news for him \u2014 and for other Republicans in high-income districts. Mr. Lance, who is in his fifth term, is winning only 39 percent of the vote against Tom Malinowski, the Democratic challenger. That\u2019s a remarkably low number for an incumbent this late in the campaign. And it\u2019s not difficult to see why Mr. Lance is struggling: A majority of the district disapproves of President Trump and a majority also prefers Democrats to take control of Congress. That\u2019s a familiar, if discomforting, tune for suburban Republicans across the country. \u2022 There were other red flags for House Republicans from lesser-known races. The party has poured millions of dollars over a period of months into some of the hardest-fought races in the most competitive districts. But what worries G.O.P. strategists, and delights Democrats, are the races that have not gotten so much money and attention. And a pair of polls, one public and one private, came out this week in two such districts. A Republican group received a survey from Illinois showing that Representative Randy Hultgren, the incumbent, was tied with his Democratic challenger, Lauren Underwood, in an exurban Chicago district that Mr. Trump carried by 4 points in 2016. Even more alarming for Republicans, a survey commissioned by a Pennsylvania ABC affiliate found that Representative Mike Kelly narrowly trailed his Democratic opponent, Ron DiNicola, in an Erie-area seat that is heavily pro-Trump. Both incumbents may survive, but these sorts of numbers this late in the campaign are the political equivalent of flashing red warning lights for the G.O.P. \u2022 At the outset of this election, few in either party thought Representative Steve King of Iowa was in any political peril. But as Mr. King continues to echo themes of white nationalism and offer support for extremist figures abroad, he is drawing the sort of unwanted attention that may create difficulties in his re-election. The New York Times, which is polling dozens of House and Senate districts in partnership with Siena College, is going to survey his heavily conservative western Iowa district to see if his provocations, which have drawn rebukes from national Republican leaders, are catching up with him at home. Stay tuned. President Trump is getting ahead of a possible midterm loss with an unsubtle message to fellow Republicans: It wasn\u2019t me. A day after Paul Ryan, the lame-duck House Speaker, gently questioned the constitutionality of Mr. Trump\u2019s proposed executive order banning birthright citizenship, the president did what he often does when he feels challenged. He escalated hostilities. By a lot. \u201cPaul Ryan should be focusing on holding the Majority rather than giving his opinions on Birthright Citizenship, something he knows nothing about!\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted. He suggested that a \u201cnew\u201d Republican majority \u2014 after Mr. Ryan is gone \u2014 would solve immigration issues. Mr. Trump enjoys little more than brushing back establishment figures in both parties. But the primary intent of Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet was not complicated: He is already pointing fingers at fellow Republicans for potential losses in the House next week. Similar flare-ups were common in 2016, when the presidential election looked lost, betraying perhaps Mr. Trump\u2019s foremost political creed: The buck stops \u2026 somewhere over there, far away. When last we checked in with Representative Joseph Crowley of New York, he had thrown his support behind Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the political upstart who dethroned him in the Democratic primary in June. He pledged to do what he could to flip the House. But Mr. Crowley remains on the ballot on two third-party lines, including the Working Families Party, and could still affect Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s race on Election Day. There is a new flier circulating online that urges voters to support Mr. Crowley, calling him the \u201cbest qualified candidate\u201d and explaining that, because of low turnout in the primary, he \u201ccame up a little short.\u201d The source of the flier is not known, but Mr. Crowley\u2019s office has disavowed any connection. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s campaign also says it does not suspect his hand in it. There have been similar entreaties: In July, the former Senator Joe Lieberman wrote an Op-Ed in The Wall Street Journal that urged voters to support Mr. Crowley in the general election; Ruben Diaz Sr., a New York City councilman who represents the South Bronx, did the same in The Bronx Chronicle in September. On Wednesday, Mr. Crowley responded to the mysterious flier. \u201cNot running. Not campaigning,\u201d he posted on Twitter. \u201cShut down campaign operations months ago. Not circulating fliers.\u201d He added: \u201cTo whoever is: knock it off. Focus should be on electing Democrats to Republican seats. I\u2019ve moved on, so should everyone else.\u201d For all the dismissals about a shadow campaign for his House seat, Mr. Crowley has evidently not forsaken a future in politics. \u201cJoe for NY\u201d is the name of his new state campaign committee, which hosted a fund-raiser on Monday in Manhattan. Senator Jon Tester of Montana has won two Senate elections without clearing 50 percent of the vote. One big reason: A Libertarian on the ballot has presumably hurt the Republican more than Mr. Tester, a Democrat. In both of his runs, Mr. Tester\u2019s margin of victory has been smaller than the vote total for the third-party candidate. But on Wednesday, Mr. Tester faced a complication: The Libertarian candidate this year, Rick Breckenridge, endorsed Matt Rosendale, the Republican nominee and state auditor. The effects of this aren\u2019t entirely clear \u2014 early voting is well underway, and Mr. Breckenridge remains on the ballot. But make no mistake: It\u2019s good news for Mr. Rosendale, whose campaign \u2014 once considered a serious long shot \u2014 has piqued top-level Republican interest in recent weeks in a state Mr. Trump carried by 20 points.

Let us know what you think at inherwords@nytimes.com. \u201cI am leaving because of a misogynistic culture that gleefully consumed my naked pictures, capitalized on my sexuality and enabled my abusive ex to continue that abuse, this time with the entire country watching.\u201d \u2014 Representative Katie Hill, Democrat of California, in her farewell speech on Capitol Hill Duncan Hunter, a Republican congressman from California, allegedly had \u201cintimate relationships\u201d with staffers and faces criminal charges for using campaign funds to pay for dates with them. President Trump has more than a dozen allegations of sexual misconduct against him. Both men remain in office. Katie Hill, a Democratic congresswoman who was once considered a rising star in her party, meanwhile, resigned this week after her own affair was revealed in sensational fashion: when her nude photographs were published by a conservative website, Red State, whose main authors were later revealed to have worked for the Republican congressman she ousted a year ago. Ms. Hill\u2019s case is not clear-cut: She was accused of having an affair with her Congressional legislative director, a violation of House rules \u2014 put in place in the wake of #MeToo \u2014 which she has denied. But she did admit to having a separate sexual relationship with a staffer on her election campaign, which is not barred by House rules. \u201cI know that even a consensual relationship with a subordinate is inappropriate, but I still allowed it to happen despite my better judgment,\u201d she wrote in a letter to her constituents. Most people would agree: Having a sexual relationship with a staffer clearly puts Ms. Hill, 32, in the wrong. (Though, of course, there are many male politicians who\u2019ve done it and remained in office.) But the manner in which the affair was exposed \u2014 the publication of sensitive photos and texts, which she blamed on her estranged husband \u2014 arguably makes her a victim, as well. On Thursday, Ms. Hill delivered an fiery farewell speech to the House, in which she argued she faced a \u201cdouble standard\u201d and attributed her resignation to the harassment she faced as a result of the photos.

Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York, described the leak as \u201crevenge porn\u201d \u2014 the intentional release of intimate materials by a sexual partner to cause distress, which is illegal in California and in Washington, D.C. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t happen to male members in the same way,\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez told Politico. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re really talking about how targeted and serious this is.\u201d As Sarah Jones noted in The Cut: \u201cThere are two Hill stories, and they shouldn\u2019t be conflated. One is a scandal and the other is a crime.

Here are some of the stories making news in Washington and politics today. _____________________ \u2022 Mayor Pete Buttigieg raised $24.8 million over the past three months. That total \u2014 likely to surpass the fund-raising figures of most of his rivals \u2014 is the latest evidence that he has gone from a long shot to a serious contender in a matter of months. \u2022 Members of Congress, including Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, visited two border detention facilities in Texas on Monday and emerged describing living conditions unfit to hold adults and children, a jail-like atmosphere, and women ranging from grandmothers to a young pregnant woman in her 20s packed into cells. \u2022 The sorority Alpha Kappa Alpha has a large membership and a multimillion-dollar budget. It\u2019s a potential secret weapon in the campaign arsenal of Senator Kamala Harris, who joined while she was an undergraduate at Howard University. \u2022 Iranian state media said the country had exceeded a key limitation on how much nuclear fuel it can possess under the 2015 international pact curbing its nuclear program, effectively declaring that it would no longer respect the agreement. \u2022 After President Trump\u2019s stroll in North Korea, he now faces a choice on whether to grant concessions in return for a freeze on North Korea\u2019s nuclear program or to insist on full denuclearization. \u2022 At one point during his eventful swing through Asia, Mr. Trump took time out to slam Jimmy Carter, dismissively calling him \u201cthe forgotten president.\u201d Forgotten is the one thing Mr. Trump, who emblazoned his name on buildings, golf courses, airplanes and even bathrobes, seems most determined not to be. \u2022 The United States\u2019 economic expansion hit a record length on Monday, a decade after the recession. Latinas have emerged as the biggest winners in the job market, but they are far from the expansion\u2019s biggest winners by other measures, like earnings. \u2022 American consumers keep buying stuff, driving solid growth through the first half of the year. But American businesses are sounding a more pessimistic note, pointing to softer growth ahead, or even contraction. Who is right about where the economy is headed? \u2022 The president said on Monday that the Pentagon would put military tanks on display Thursday in Washington as part of his plan to turn the Fourth of July celebration into a salute to the country\u2019s military prowess.

      "author": "Sheryl Gay Stolberg",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 During his first run for the Senate in 2010, Joe Manchin III, the Democrat from West Virginia, took aim \u2014 literally \u2014 at a climate change bill, shooting a bullet through it in a television ad. Now some Democrats are taking aim at Mr. Manchin, declaring him unfit to be the top Democrat on the committee that handles climate change. As the Senate undergoes the customary postelection reshuffling of committees, Mr. Manchin, whose state is a major coal producer, has become a leading contender to become the senior Democrat on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. But his pro-coal views and past campaign contributions from coal companies are causing a stir on his party\u2019s left. Over the past several days, two potential Democratic White House aspirants \u2014 Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington and Tom Steyer, the billionaire philanthropist who has made fighting climate change his signature issue \u2014 have joined environmental advocates in calling on Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, to keep Mr. Manchin out of the ranking spot. \u201cHe supports Donald Trump\u2019s dirty energy agenda,\u201d Mr. Inslee wrote in an email to supporters. \u201cHe simply can\u2019t be trusted to make the bold, progressive decisions we need.\u201d The push to block Mr. Manchin \u2014 which is unlikely to succeed \u2014 underscores the deep fissures among Democrats as they head into the 2020 campaign, where they will be balancing a desire to energize the left against appealing to moderates and white working-class voters who voted in 2016 for President Trump. Mr. Manchin just won a tough re-election bid in a state Mr. Trump won by more than 40 points in 2016. In a party where the left is feeling emboldened, he is a member of a rare and shrinking breed: the centrist Democrat. \u201cCome in and talk to me, the door\u2019s open,\u201d Mr. Manchin said Thursday, brushing past reporters who sought his response to his critics. If the ranking position, which is awarded on the basis of seniority, is offered to him, he said he would take it. \u201cI want to do whatever I can to help my country and my state,\u201d he said. The senator has also addressed his critics another way, by reversing himself to vote against Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Mr. Manchin was the sole Democrat to vote in favor of the nominee, Bernard McNamee, in committee. But he changed his mind, he said, after seeing video footage of Mr. McNamee denying that climate change is caused by humans. A statement he issued seemed designed to send a strong message to his detractors. \u201cClimate change is real, humans have made a significant impact, and we have the responsibility and capability to address it urgently,\u201d it said. Despite his opposition, Mr. McNamee was confirmed on Thursday, 50 to 49. Mr. Manchin\u2019s ability to win as a Democrat in a deep-red state has helped hold down the Republican majority in the Senate. But he votes with Mr. Trump 60.8 percent of the time, according to the website FiveThirtyEight. Fewer than half of his votes line up with the positions advanced by the  League of Conservation Voters, an environmental advocacy group. He is also about to lose his two closest ideological compatriots: Senator Joe Donnelly of Indiana and Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Democrats who lost their re-election bids last month. Both of them voted against the confirmation of Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh; Mr. Manchin, bowing to the will of his constituents, was the lone Democrat to vote in favor. Mr. Manchin\u2019s campaign contributions from coal and energy companies have also drawn the ire of the progressive left. Of the 20 senators who received the most money from coal mining interests in 2018, he ranks 11th and is the sole Democrat, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks campaign finance. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the firebrand Democrat and incoming House freshman from New York who has been pushing for a so-called Green New Deal, cited those contributions last week when she expressed opposition to Mr. Manchin. \u201cI have concerns over the senator\u2019s chairmanship just because I do not believe that we should be financed by the industries that we are supposed to be legislating and regulating and touching with our legislation,\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez told reporters at a news conference with members of the Sunrise Movement, an environmental advocacy group. Movement members also protested outside Mr. Schumer\u2019s New York office on Monday. Under the seniority system by which Senate Democrats govern themselves, several of Mr. Manchin\u2019s colleagues are ahead of him in the line for the top spot on the energy panel. But for various reasons \u2014 including the tradition that a senator serves as the ranking member of only one committee \u2014 they seem likely to turn it down. The maneuvering, which will be sorted out before the next Congress begins, is like a game of political musical chairs. Senator Maria Cantwell of Washington, currently the top Democrat on the energy panel, may move to the Commerce Committee, replacing Senator Bill Nelson of Florida, who lost his re-election bid. Next in seniority is Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, but he wants to keep his top spot on the Finance Committee. Then comes Senator Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, who has shown no inclination to vacate the top spot on the Agriculture Committee. That leaves Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an independent who caucuses with Democrats and holds the party\u2019s top spot on the Budget Committee; he has not stated his intentions, and waved away questions on Thursday. If Mr. Sanders rejects Energy and Commerce in favor of remaining the ranking member on the budget panel, the job would be Mr. Manchin\u2019s \u2014 unless Mr. Schumer intervened, which would be likely to cause an uproar in his caucus. A spokesman for Mr. Schumer declined to comment. As the controversy swirled, other Democrats came to Mr. Manchin\u2019s defense on Thursday, arguing that no one senator \u2014 not even one in a top spot of a relevant committee \u2014 will set policy on climate change. Even so, Mr. Manchin\u2019s future is likely to come up when Democrats organize their committee slates for the coming Congress. \u201cI\u2019m sure there will be some discussion among members; I think it\u2019s a worthwhile conversation to have,\u201d said Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut. But, Mr. Murphy added, \u201cnobody in our caucus has veto power over climate policy, whether they\u2019re the ranking member on a committee or not.\u201d",

      "author": "Maggie Haberman",
      "content": " President Trump on Friday targeted Representative Ilhan Omar for remarks she made during a speech on civil rights and Muslims in America with a graphic video featuring the burning World Trade Center towers and other images from Sept. 11, 2001, that he tweeted to millions of his followers. The Twitter post from the president stoked and amplified a controversy that has been a focus of conservative news outlets, which have sought to elevate Ms. Omar \u2014 a Minnesota Democrat and one of the first Muslim women elected to Congress \u2014 as a political target, as Mr. Trump\u2019s re-election campaign begins in earnest. At issue were remarks that Ms. Omar made last month at an event hosted by the Council on American-Islamic Relations. There, she gave a speech in which she addressed lingering fear directed at Muslims, and the rights Muslims have to speak out about being viewed with suspicion. During the speech, she said that Muslims had \u201clived with the discomfort of being a second-class citizen and, frankly, I\u2019m tired of it, and every single Muslim in this country should be tired of it.\u201d She added that the council was created after the Sept. 11 attacks \u201cbecause they recognized that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties.\u201d (The Council on American-Islamic Relations was actually founded in 1994.) Conservative news outlets and some Republican officials have focused on the words \u201csome people did something,\u201d arguing that Ms. Omar was playing down the attacks that killed more than 3,000 people and led to two yearslong wars. The video the president tweeted also focused on those four words from Ms. Omar\u2019s speech. A spokesman for Ms. Omar has said the speech was addressing civil rights. Ms. Omar has already been the focus of threats, including one by a supporter of Mr. Trump who was recently arrested. Ms. Omar\u2019s closest ally in the House, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York, used Twitter to defend her colleague and urged others to do the same. \u201cMembers of Congress have a duty to respond to the President\u2019s explicit attack today,\u201d she tweeted. \u201c@IlhanMN\u2019s life is in danger. For our colleagues to be silent is to be complicit in the outright, dangerous targeting of a member of Congress. We must speak out.\u201d She included in her post the famous words of a Lutheran minister, Martin Niem\u00f6ller, who had been a Nazi sympathizer, about turning his head on the Nazis\u2019 actions during World War II. Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, who is running for president as a Democrat, quickly joined Ms. Ocasio-Cortez. \u201cIlhan Omar is a leader with strength and courage. She won\u2019t back down to Trump\u2019s racism and hate, and neither will we,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cThe disgusting and dangerous attacks against her must end.\u201d In a series of tweets, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., a Democratic presidential candidate and a veteran who served in Afghanistan, also criticized Mr. Trump. \u201cAfter 9/11 we all said we were changed. That we were stronger and more united,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cThat\u2019s what \u2018never forget\u2019 was about. Now, a president uses that dark day to incite his base against a member of Congress, as if for sport. As if we learned nothing that day about the workings of hate.\u201d Another 2020 presidential candidate, Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, also chimed in. \u201cThe President is inciting violence against a sitting Congresswoman\u2014and an entire group of Americans based on their religion,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cIt\u2019s disgusting. It\u2019s shameful. And any elected leader who refuses to condemn it shares responsibility for it.\u201d It was unclear late Friday who made the video that the president tweeted. In recent weeks, his Twitter feed has promoted at least two controversial videos that came from elsewhere on the web.",

But with her in their debt, the would-be speaker is emboldening them.By Sheryl Gay Stolberg and Astead W. HerndonPRINT EDITIONIn Courting New Liberals, Pelosi Risks Freedom Caucus of the Left|November 28, 2018, Page A16",
      "author": "Sheryl Gay Stolberg",
      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 When Rashida Tlaib, a newly elected Democrat from Michigan and favorite of the liberal left, met privately last week with Representative Nancy Pelosi, who was seeking her vote for speaker, she pointedly demanded an end to \u201cthe old culture of waiting your turn.\u201d Taking aim at the seniority system that Ms. Pelosi used to climb the ranks of the House, Ms. Tlaib pressed the would-be speaker from California to give progressive newcomers coveted seats on powerful committees like Appropriations and Ways and Means \u2014 spots usually reserved for veterans. Ms. Tlaib, who once said she would \u201cprobably not\u201d vote for Ms. Pelosi, appears headed to do so when Democrats elect their leaders on Wednesday, one member of a crew of boisterous young liberals who have become shock troops in Ms. Pelosi\u2019s leadership battle. But by empowering newcomers like Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, Jahana Hayes of Connecticut, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Ms. Tlaib, Ms. Pelosi risks creating a headache for herself down the road: a Democratic version of the House Freedom Caucus, the far-right group that consistently defies Republican leadership, making life difficult for Speaker Paul D. Ryan. With Ms. Pelosi in their debt, the potential speaker may be giving voice to their dissatisfaction with mainstream Democrats, emboldening them as tensions between their midterm campaigns and the party establishment linger. In a closed-door meeting with the incoming freshman Democrats on Tuesday, Ms. Pelosi walked a fine line, acknowledging their \u201cidealism, integrity and imagination\u201d while warning of the risks of being intransigent. \u201cWe want to remove all doubt to how we go forward in a way that puts our best foot forward on Day 1, in order to show that we can govern,\u201d she said, according to one person present, adding, \u201cMake your fight, make your case, but not every fight is the last fight.\u201d Ms. Pelosi, however, is a skilled navigator of turbulent waters. During the campaign, she resisted calls from progressives to support the movement to abolish Immigration and Customs Enforcement and pushed back against efforts from the left to engage President Trump tit for tat on divisive issues like immigration. But after an election in which Democrats made considerable gains in districts won by Mr. Trump, the prospect of a crop of outspoken progressives having outsize power and influence in a newly realigned Washington is worrying some of the more pragmatic Democrats, especially those who flipped Republican seats this month. \u201cFor me and for any of the others in these red-to-blue seats, we\u2019re in a position that if we ever want to hold onto these seats \u2014 and we\u2019re the ones who delivered the majority \u2014 then we have to be able to go back to our districts and show that we\u2019ve accomplished something,\u201d said Katie Hill, an incoming freshman from California, who strongly backs Ms. Pelosi. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to be strong as a majority, we need to be cohesive as much as possible,\u201d Ms. Hill said. \u201cWe can\u2019t be like the Republicans and the Tea Party.\u201d Some of the progressive freshmen already have their own brands, and their own following. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, for instance, has managed to enthrall a new generation of millennials by taking them behind the scenes of freshman orientation with her lively Instagram account. They contend that they need to have prominent roles because they have brought people into the electorate who were not previously engaged. And some like Ms. Tlaib \u2014 who carefully explained her position on Ms. Pelosi by saying that \u201cno one is running against her\u201d and that she did not intend to vote for a Republican \u2014 have made clear that their support may come at a price. A former community organizer and environmental activist who is one of the first two Muslim women elected to Congress, Ms. Tlaib made waves on the first day of freshman orientation when she joined a protest demanding Ms. Pelosi give greater powers to a new select committee on climate change. (Unlike Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, though, she did not participate in a sit-in at Ms. Pelosi\u2019s office.) Her district is among the poorest in Michigan, one where clean air and clean water are everyday concerns. Ms. Tlaib said she had been pushing behind closed doors for Democratic leaders to bar members from serving on the panel if they had taken industry contributions. Apart from that, she wants a seat on the Appropriations Committee. \u201cLet\u2019s do it differently. Let\u2019s transform this Congress and have it reflect this new class,\u201d she said, recounting her message to Ms. Pelosi. \u201cPeople want to say, \u2018Thank you so much, this is great, this is the most diverse class.\u2019 Well, so honor it. Honor it by putting us at the table to make decisions.\u201d Ms. Pressley, who won her seat in Massachusetts after ousting an incumbent Democrat in a primary, used her private meeting with Ms. Pelosi to extract a promise that Ms. Pelosi would bring up a bill, early in the new Congress, requiring background checks for all gun purchases. Ms. Pelosi has also appointed her to a gun violence prevention task force; after she made that commitment, Ms. Pressley announced she would support Ms. Pelosi for speaker. \u201cI have lived and campaigned by the mantra that I do not need to ask permission to lead,\u201d she said in a statement. Ms. Hayes, the incoming representative from Connecticut who won after a grueling primary in which the state party backed her opponent, said in an interview that winning as an outsider had freed her from the traditional deference to the party establishment figures. She said she refused two direct requests of support from Ms. Pelosi, before announcing her support in a statement on Tuesday. Ms. Hayes will back Ms. Pelosi because not voting for her \u201cwould be voting for a Republican.\u201d While she did not bargain or request specific committee assignments in return, she said Ms. Pelosi did commit during their private meeting to addressing calls for a generational shift in leadership. \u201cI ran because I think we need to make some changes in how our government operates,\u201d Ms. Hayes said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not so wedded to this seat or a seat in Congress to now begin to compromise the things that I believe in.\u201d Lauren Underwood, an incoming representative from Illinois who backed Ms. Pelosi last week, echoed the sentiment. Her advisers still bristle at what they believe was overt mistreatment by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and other party-allied groups during the campaign season. While she said she harbored no ill will, \u201cit is not lost on me that I was not their top choice.\u201d With the arrival of so many new freshmen, membership in the Congressional Progressive Caucus has jumped to more than 90 from 78, accounting for more than one-third of all House Democrats, according to progressive caucus officials. The caucus, like the newest members, is also flexing its muscles, and has extracted a promise from Ms. Pelosi that progressives will have proportional representation on House committees. One test of the progressives\u2019 newfound clout may come in Wednesday\u2019s race for leader of the House Democratic Caucus. Representative Barbara Lee of California, a favorite of the progressives, is running against Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York in a contest that seems too close to call. Ms. Lee has drawn support from outside groups like Move On and the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which have also backed many of the candidates on the liberal left. In her announcement pressing for Ms. Pelosi, Ms. Pressley pointedly noted that she also supported Ms. Lee. Will Levitt, a co-founder of Square One Politics, the political consulting firm that has advised several freshman Democrats, including Ms. Underwood, said the new members were serving notice to the Democratic Party, and the party would be wise to recognize that the young progressives can be useful allies. \u201cOf course focusing on supporting women and people of color and L.G.B.T. candidates feels like the right thing to do,\u201d Mr. Levitt said. \u201cBut it also happens to be the strategic thing to do for the party \u2014 these are the future leaders. These are the people who folks across the country are psyched about.\u201d",

      "content": "Good Monday morning. Here are some of the stories making news in Washington and politics today. _____________________ \u2022 Mike Pompeo will face his greatest test as secretary of state this week, when he accompanies President Trump to a summit meeting with North Korea\u2019s leaders: He must keep Mr. Trump from giving away U.S. leverage on denuclearization while remaining in Mr. Trump\u2019s good graces. \u2022 Vice President Mike Pence is commonly seen around Washington as a mute helpmate to a bombastic president. On foreign soil, he has toyed with the idea of branching out \u2014 just not too far. \u2022 Mr. Trump delayed his own deadline to increase tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese imports, citing \u201csubstantial progress\u201d during a week of trade talks in Washington between American and Chinese officials. \u2022 Last week, home for the first district workweek of their term, moderate Democrats got to see firsthand how the voices of a small but vocal number of liberal lawmakers are reverberating in far more marginal districts. \u2022 Even before Democrats finish drafting bills to create a single-payer health care system, the health care and insurance industries have assembled a small army of lobbyists to kill \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d \u2022 Representative Adam B. Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said that House Democrats were prepared to go to court to force the release of the final report from the special counsel, Robert Mueller, if it were not made public. \u2022 Who is Konstantin Kilimnik, and what did he and Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, discuss in 2016? Here\u2019s the story behind the Russian operative pivotal to the special counsel investigation. \u2022 Federal prosecutors portrayed Mr. Manafort as a hardened, remorseless criminal who \u201crepeatedly and brazenly\u201d violated a host of laws over more than a decade. \u2022 Justice Democrats, the small grass-roots organization that helped Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez win her House seat, wants to replace more centrist Democrats with liberal candidates. That has made some lawmakers uneasy. \u2022 Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland, a moderate Republican, told The Times that he was not actively preparing to run against Mr. Trump. But he said he was open to running and listening to appeals from Mr. Trump\u2019s Republican critics. \u2022 Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York traveled to Iowa to advise Democrats on how to take back the White House in 2020 \u2014 even as he was unsure if that strategy included his candidacy. _____________________ Were you forwarded this newsletter?

      "content": " Hampton University, a private school in Virginia, said on Thursday that it had fired nine officers from its Police Department after a school investigation uncovered racist and misogynistic posts they had shared on social media. The university said in a statement that it fired the officers for \u201cegregious violations of the university\u2019s code of conduct.\u201d \u201cEvery member of the Hampton University community must adhere to the university\u2019s code of conduct,\u201d the university said in an emailed statement. \u201cAfter a full investigation, it was determined that the officers shared misogynistic, racist and other offensive remarks via social media.\u201d The university said it had \u201czero tolerance for such behavior.\u201d The Hampton University Police Department employed 27 sworn officers in 2018, according to state figures. The department also employs 10 \u201csecurity officers,\u201d according to its website. It was unclear Thursday what positions the fired officers had held. The university did not provide any further information about the violations or the identities, ranks or tenure of the officers. A person who answered the department\u2019s phone on Thursday evening said no one was available to speak about the firings. The announcement came amid growing scrutiny over police conduct on social media and the prejudice such online posts might expose. In June, the Plain View Project released a database that showed current and former police officers using content that was racist, misogynist, Islamophobic or otherwise biased. The project, which was founded by a lawyer, looked at social media activity from eight police departments across the United States. That project prompted investigations and repercussions in Philadelphia, Phoenix, St. Louis and elsewhere. The Hampton University firings did not appear to be connected to the project. Earlier this week, two police officers in Gretna, La., were fired, four days after one of them referred to Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York as a \u201cvile idiot\u201d on Facebook and suggested that she should be shot. Hampton University was founded in 1868 as Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute, and is known as one of the top historically black universities in the United States. Booker T. Washington earned a degree from the institution in 1875, and President Barack Obama delivered a commencement speech there in 2010.",

      "author": "Sheryl Gay Stolberg",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the liberal Democratic upstart from New York, is bringing a sexual assault survivor who cornered a Republican senator in an elevator, demanding to know if he was going to vote to confirm Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh. Representative Pramila Jayapal, Democrat of Washington and a chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, is bringing a climate change scientist. Representative Ilhan Omar, Democrat of Minnesota and a Somali refugee, is bringing a Liberian refugee who is threatened with deportation. And all will be wearing white. When President Trump delivers his State of the Union address on Tuesday night to Congress \u2014 his first under divided government \u2014 the left wing of the ascendant House Democrats will have a rare opportunity to confront him. In 2016, Republicans headed for the exits before President Barack Obama had even finished his final address, and one famously shouted, \u201cYou lie!\u201d in 2009 when Mr. Obama addressed Congress on health care. The new Democrats \u2014 many of them women, and many of them people of color \u2014 are planning to send their own pointed messages to the president with their choices of guests and attire. Many women will wear white \u2014 the color of the women\u2019s suffrage movement \u2014 to spotlight issues like reproductive rights and equal pay. Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the Democratic leader, will be handing out white lapel ribbons to the men. Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, told reporters on Monday that Mr. Trump intends to make some gestures of peace: \u201cHe\u2019s calling for cooperation, and he\u2019s calling for comity \u2014 c-o-m-i-t-y \u2014 and also compromise.\u201d But he may find an inhospitable audience. \u201cI think the goal here is to really show the tremendous step backwards that our country has taken under this president,\u201d Ms. Jayapal told reporters on a conference call on Monday, \u201cand to call out the very specific ways in which he has pushed policies to undermine our climate, undermine immigrants, undermine worker protections and undermine, of course, women\u2019s reproductive rights.\u201d [Some of the Trumps\u2019 guests are the human faces of narratives that the president has been crafting and wishes to advance.] State of the Union addresses are almost always remembered as much for their theatrics as for their policy announcements. Mr. Trump\u2019s, delayed one week by the partial government shutdown, is coming at a particularly tense moment \u2014 less than two weeks before the deadline for House and Senate negotiators to come up with a plan for border security that will avert another shutdown. It will also be the first Trump State of the Union address with Representative Nancy Pelosi presiding as speaker. Ms. Pelosi, Democrat of California, an institutionalist and a stickler for decorum, is unlikely to look kindly on any outbursts from her members. She will introduce him as the president of the United States, released by custom from having to utter his name. Congress-watchers are already wondering what the dynamic will be like between her and Mr. Trump \u2014 and what messages her body language and expressions will convey \u2014 when she stands behind him, captured on television cameras, during the speech. \u201cThat photograph is worth the price of admission,\u201d said Representative Gerald E. Connolly, Democrat of Virginia, who is bringing Amer Al-Mudallal, an Iraq-born chemist who was furloughed from the Environmental Protection Agency during the record-breaking shutdown, along with his wife. \u201cThis is a president \u2014 I can\u2019t even say he struggles with empathy; he lacks any signs of an empathic capacity to understand the suffering or plight of other people,\u201d Mr. Connolly said, adding, \u201cI want my guest to give witness, by virtue of being here, to the president that real human beings were negatively affected by your shutdown.\u201d Members of Congress each get one ticket to bring a guest to the State of the Union address; sometimes they invite family members, but more often they use their tickets to make a point. Addressing gun violence is high on the agendas of several Democrats. Representative Lucy McBath, Democrat of Georgia, whose son Jordan Davis, 17, was shot to death in 2012 by a man upset that he was playing loud music, is bringing Jeff Binkley, the father of Maura Binkley, 21, who was killed last year in a shooting at a yoga studio in Tallahassee, Fla. Representative Ted Deutch, Democrat of Florida, is bringing Manny Oliver, whose son Joaquin Oliver was killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., during the massacre there last year. \u201cI hope the president will take note of how the American people voted to send a gun safety majority to Congress,\u201d Mr. Deutch said in a statement, \u201cand live up to his previous promises to stand up to the N.R.A. and support meaningful policies to make our communities safer.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration policy is also top of mind for Democrats this year. Representative Bonnie Watson Coleman, Democrat of New Jersey, is bringing Victorina Morales, an undocumented immigrant who spoke out about her work at Mr. Trump\u2019s golf resort in Bedminster, N.J. Representative Adriano Espaillat, Democrat of New York, has invited Yeni Gonz\u00e1lez, a mother who was separated from her three children at the border, while Representative Veronica Escobar, a freshman Democrat from Texas, is bringing an immigrants\u2019 rights advocate whose father has been deported to Mexico. Ms. Omar\u2019s guest, Linda Clark, fled civil war in Liberia in 2000 and has lived in the United States for the past 18 years, but may be forced to leave because of Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to end special protections for thousands of Liberian immigrants. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s guest, Ana Maria Archila, is a resident of Queens who helps direct the Center for Popular Democracy, a progressive advocacy group. She confronted Jeff Flake, then a Republican senator from Arizona, in an elevator during the Kavanaugh hearings. The encounter prompted Mr. Flake to call for an F.B.I. investigation into accusations that then-Judge Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted a women when they were in high school. In an interview, Ms. Archila said she senses a new energy this year around the State of the Union address. \u201cUnlike last year, when Trump had the presidency and the Republicans were firmly in charge of both houses of Congress and essentially enabling his agenda to be forced on the country, this time around, the energy is with the people who protested,\u201d she said. She added that \u201cthe wave of women\u201d just elected \u201cspeak with so much moral clarity in the face of someone who is so willing to lie and bend the truth and fan the flames of hate and fear.\u201d",

They arrive in Washington for orientation this week.By Sheryl Gay StolbergPRINT EDITIONHouse Democrats Are Diverse, Drive Push to Discredit Recount And Unlikely to Toe Party Line|November 13, 2018, Page A1",
      "author": "Sheryl Gay Stolberg",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 There is a former N.F.L. linebacker, a climate scientist, and a rapper with a Harvard Law degree. There is one immigrant from Somalia and another from Ecuador. There are two former C.I.A. officials, an Air Force veteran, a former Navy helicopter pilot, and a retired Marine commander \u2014 all of them women. Not to mention a pediatrician and a human rights advocate. When these and other newly elected House Democrats arrive in Washington for their orientation this week, they will reflect the most diverse, most female freshman class in history \u2014 a group of political neophytes, savvy veterans of the Obama and Clinton administrations, as well as the first Muslim women and Native American women ever elected to Congress. The class is ideologically diverse as well, spanning the philosophical spectrum from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a self-described democratic socialist from New York, to Joe Cunningham, a South Carolina lawyer who won a stunning upset victory in the Charleston suburbs, on the strength of his promises to put \u201ccountry over party\u201d and work with President Trump. That could prove a management headache for Democratic leaders. \u201cThe new Democratic leadership and the entire Democratic caucus will really have to pull together to ensure a unified legislative agenda that appeals to constituents in Brooklyn, New York, while appealing to constituents in Brooklyn, Iowa,\u201d said Steve Israel, a former congressman from New York and one-time chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. \u201cThe way to keep these new Democrats in 2020 is not to do things that force their voters to reconsider, and that won\u2019t be easy.\u201d The road to the Democrats\u2019 victory ran through districts in states like Texas and Kansas, Iowa and Michigan, where moderate and independent-minded voters turned away from Mr. Trump, often knocking out veteran incumbents. The blue wave even reached Oklahoma, where Kendra Horn ousted Representative Steve Russell in a district considered safe for Republicans. That race was one of the biggest surprises of election night. So for all the talk of the rise of the progressive left \u2014 embodied by the rock star of the class, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez \u2014 the bulk of the newcomers might better be described as pragmatists. All told the Democratic freshman class numbers more than 50; there are still some races yet to be decided. Nearly two dozen had the endorsement of the New Democrat Coalition, a centrist group that describes its members as \u201ccommitted to pro-economic growth, pro-innovation, and fiscally responsible policies.\u201d These members especially will face tough choices over whether to resist Mr. Trump, cooperate with him \u2014 or do both. \u201cIt\u2019s both,\u201d said Lori Trahan, a former congressional chief of staff who defeated a Republican businessman in Massachusetts. \u201cWhat this election said to me is that the country wants checks and balances on this administration; they want Congress to act as a coequal branch of government and to hold this administration accountable when necessary.\u201d One of the most striking features of the new class is its litany of firsts. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan are the first Muslim-American women ever elected to Congress; Ms. Omar, a state legislator, will also become the first Somali-American in the House. Like her predecessor, Keith Ellison, she has said she would likely be sworn in using a Quran. In the suburbs of Kansas City, Sharice Davids, an openly gay woman and member of the Ho-Chunk Nation, toppled a Republican incumbent, Representative Kevin Yoder, to become one of the first Native American women to serve in Congress. The other is Deb Haaland of New Mexico, who will replace Michelle Lujan Grisham, just elected governor. \u201cWe have a record-breaking number of women of color going to Congress who will be sworn in in January,\u201d Ms. Haaland said in an interview. \u201cConsidering the fact that Native women have never had a voice in Congress for 240 years, it\u2019s significant that we have an opportunity to bring that voice to the table.\u201d Among those women of color is Ayanna Pressley, who in 2009 became the first black woman elected to the Boston City Council. Then she stunned the Massachusetts political establishment when she beat Representative Michael Capuano in a primary earlier this year. Known for her fiery speaking style, she is, like Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, a darling of the progressive left, and she said in an interview that she is eager to bring her voice \u2014 and her passion for issues like overhauling the criminal justice system \u2014 to a Capitol that is still an overwhelmingly white male world. \u201cWashington is only a microcosm of society at large, and navigating these waters and terrain is not completely alien to me,\u201d she said. \u201cThe corridors of power and most decision-making tables are dominated by white men. That was true when I was elected to the Boston City Council, and they enthusiastically embraced my agenda.\u201d Though no one is keeping records, Antonio Delgado of New York, a former Rhodes Scholar and Harvard-educated lawyer, is almost certainly the first rapper ever elected to Congress. His rap career was brief, but it did provide fodder for attacks from Republicans. There are at least four people who identify as lesbian, gay or bisexual in the new Democratic class; they include Angie Craig, a health care human resources official who ousted a Republican incumbent in the suburbs of St. Paul, Minn. She said she takes pride in being another first: the first lesbian mother in Congress. She and her wife have four sons. \u201cI think the thing that impresses me most about the voters of this district,\u201d she said in an interview, \u201cis that it didn\u2019t matter.\u201d And Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, who defeated Representative Carlos Curbelo for a seat representing South Florida, celebrated in a phone interview when reminded that she is the first Ecuadorean-American representative in Congress, according to House historian records. \u201cI'm making history, yay!\u201d she exclaimed. Many of the newcomers have deep Washington experience. Perhaps the most prominent among them is Donna Shalala of Florida, who was health and human services secretary to President Bill Clinton, and who, at 77, is probably the oldest freshman. (The youngest is Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, who at 29 is also the youngest woman ever elected to Congress.) The Washington veterans include the former N.F.L. linebacker Colin Allred of Texas, a civil rights lawyer who also worked in President Barack Obama\u2019s Housing and Urban Development Department; Elissa Slotkin, a former C.I.A. officer who served in Mr. Obama\u2019s Defense Department; and Andy Kim of New Jersey, another Obama administration alumnus who served as a civilian adviser in Iraq. They will be joined by Tom Malinowski of New Jersey, a Polish-born diplomat and human rights advocate who served in the Obama State Department. (\u201cHe stood up to dictators. He\u2019ll stand up for you,\u201d his campaign website proclaims.) Like so many first-time candidates who ran this year, he was motivated to run by the election of Mr. Trump. He also has a leg up on other freshmen: He already owns a house in Washington. \u201cI think you\u2019re going to see the House, in particular, reasserting itself because we have this infusion of experienced people, including many military veterans and those like me who served in a civilian capacity,\u201d he said in an interview. His advice to his new colleagues: \u201cI think we need to be calm, and not panic.\u201d There were so many female veterans and national security experts running as Democrats this year that they formed a text message group to keep in touch while they were campaigning, said Chrissy Houlahan, an engineer and Air Force veteran who just won a House seat in a district north and west of Philadelphia. \u201cWe realized we have a lot in common, and we were running for the same reason, we were answering a new call to serve,\u201d she said. They include Ms. Slotkin of Michigan and another former C.I.A. official, Abigail Spanberger, who unseated Representative Dave Brat in Virginia; Elaine Luria, a retired Navy commander in Virginia; and Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, a former federal prosecutor and retired Navy pilot who was making her first run for public office. In her victory speech on election night, Ms. Sherrill recounted how she asked her daughter Maggie, the oldest of her four young children, if she was \u201cO.K. with this.\u201d Her daughter, she said, came back with a question of her own: \u201cIf you don\u2019t run, who will?\u201d",

But when a fiery freshman Democrat practically accused a conservative Republican of racism on Wednesday, the uneasy truce that Mr. Cummings brokered put him in the center of a raw debate over race and gender in a changing House. The heated exchange came at the end of Wednesday\u2019s explosive House Oversight Committee hearing featuring Michael D. Cohen. After Representative Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina, brought in a black political appointee of President Trump\u2019s in an effort to prove Mr. Trump is not racist, Representative Rashida Tlaib, Democrat of Michigan, called it racist to \u201cactually use a prop, a black woman in this chamber, in this committee.\u201d Mr. Meadows, red-faced and near tears, demanded that Ms. Tlaib\u2019s words be \u201ctaken down\u201d \u2014 struck from the record as a violation of House rules \u2014 and Mr. Cummings asked Ms. Tlaib to explain herself. She apologized. Then the questions began. \u201cWhose emotions do we put first?\u201d said Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, a close ally of Ms. Tlaib\u2019s who is on the oversight panel and witnessed the encounter. \u201cWe had to apologize for him getting hurt feelings over her saying and calling out a racist practice,\u201d but Ms. Tlaib was also \u201churt, and no apology was furnished to her.\u201d The Root, a website that focuses on race, went further: \u201cCummings\u2019 handling of Tlaib yesterday is part of a larger problem the Democratic Party has with this new class of women of color: Democrats want women of color in Congress, but they can\u2019t seem to handle their truth-telling,\u201d wrote Terrell Jermaine Starr. He added, \u201cHe messed up and needs to apologize to Tlaib nonetheless \u2014 publicly. Otherwise, Republicans will take Meadows\u2019 cue and cry a river of white tears each time a woman of color dares to call them out on their racism.\u201d The episode underscored who Mr. Cummings is and how he wants to run his committee. On Thursday, many of his colleagues \u2014 including Ms. Ocasio-Cortez \u2014 came to his defense, saying he handled a difficult situation well by preventing an important and historic hearing from going off the rails. But outside the Capitol, the reviews were less kind. Critics were furious that Mr. Cummings had called Mr. Meadows \u201cone of my best friends,\u201d and resurfaced several 2012 campaign videos showing Mr. Meadows saying he intended to send President Barack Obama \u201chome to Kenya, or wherever it is.\u201d Beyond that contretemps, the Cohen hearing served to shine a national spotlight on a new generation of outspoken young Democrats, many of them women of color, who are forcing pointed conversations about race and abandoning the unwritten protocols of decorum in the way their elders \u2014 who often agree with them \u2014 have not. \u201cYou have to bear witness, bear witness to the truth,\u201d said Representative John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia and a civil rights icon, who applauded young women of color for getting into what he likes to call \u201cgood trouble, necessary trouble.\u201d \u201cThis body is going to continue to change as more people of a diverse background come,\u201d Mr. Lewis said. \u201cAmerica is changing. We all need to get on board.\u201d But a generational divide could be emerging, especially with some African-American elders who have been in the House for decades. \u201cI think they certainly bring a different perspective in some ways,\u201d said Representative Danny K. Davis, Democrat of Illinois. \u201cI think the wording sometimes is a little different. The level of what might be called \u2018professional civility\u2019 may be a little different, but I think the individuals are expressing in many ways the same feelings and are saying the same things.\u201d For the House Republican Conference, 90 percent of whom are white and male, some uncomfortable moments are inevitable. Mr. Meadows called the \u201cbirther\u201d videos \u201cold news\u201d on Thursday and said he had previously apologized. He also appeared to reconcile with Ms. Tlaib; the two shared a hug and a seemingly cordial talk on the House floor. \u201cShe said she didn\u2019t mean it yesterday, so there was no need to apologize,\u201d he told reporters afterward. \u201cI wanted her to know, and she wanted me to know, that our relationship is one that will hopefully provide real good results going forward.\u201d Mr. Meadows and Ms. Tlaib are political and cultural opposites. Mr. Meadows, 59, a well-to-do real estate developer, is the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus and one of Mr. Trump\u2019s most ardent defenders on Capitol Hill. Ms. Tlaib, 42, made headlines on her first day in office after she was captured on video using an expletive to describe Mr. Trump as she spoke of her desire to impeach him. A lawyer and social justice advocate from Detroit, she is the daughter of Palestinian immigrants and one of the first two Muslim women in Congress. She did not respond to a request for an interview on Thursday. Mr. Cummings brushed aside questions. \u201cI\u2019m not going to talk about that,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we were able to resolve it. I think we ended up with civility.\u201d Congress, of course, has been grappling with issues of race for most of its existence, and certainly the debates during the civil rights era were pointed and passionate. But the rise of Mr. Trump, who has referred to a former black aide, Omarosa Manigault Newman, as \u201ca dog\u201d and declared that there were \u201cvery fine people on both sides\u201d of the white supremacists\u2019 march in 2017 in Charlottesville, Va., has made Washington\u2019s conversation about race deeply personal for Ms. Tlaib and other lawmakers of color. \u201cAs representatives of communities that are on the margins of how the president defines his vision of America, I think they bring an urgency and an emotional depth to their rhetoric that is not just academic,\u201d said Representative Ro Khanna, Democrat of California, who was also present for the Tlaib-Meadows exchange. \u201cIt\u2019s lived experience.\u201d Alexandra Rojas, the executive director of Justice Democrats, a liberal organization that helped elect both Ms. Tlaib and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, described Ms. Tlaib as \u201cone of a new generation of Democrats who is going to puncture the silence even when it\u2019s uncomfortable.\u201d Mr. Meadows anticipated that Mr. Cohen, Mr. Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer, would describe the president as racist, which is why he asked the Trump appointee, Lynne Patton of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, to attend. When it was his turn to speak, he asked her to rise, and then he spoke for her, saying that she disagreed with Mr. Cohen and that \u201cthere was no way that she would work for an individual who was racist.\u201d Ms. Tlaib was incredulous: \u201cThe fact that someone would actually use a prop, a black woman in this chamber, in this committee, is alone racist in itself.\u201d Another Michigan Democrat, Representative Brenda Lawrence, who is African-American, said it was \u201ctotally insulting\u201d for Mr. Meadows to \u201cprop up one member of our entire race.\u201d Representative Ayanna S. Pressley, a freshman Democrat from Massachusetts who is black, asked Mr. Cohen whether it was possible for Mr. Trump to \u201chave a black friend and still be racist,\u201d to which he replied, \u201cYes.\u201d In fact, the only Democrats to call Mr. Meadows out were women of color. Men of color on the committee, such as Mr. Khanna and Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois, held their tongues. While Mr. Cummings may have wanted to put the matter to rest, the exchange was reverberating inside and outside the Capitol. \u201cI think that he handled it in the way that made sense for him and the committee in that moment,\u201d said Adrianne Shropshire, the executive director of Black PAC, which mobilizes black voters. \u201cHe is the chair of the committee, and a part of that role has to be to facilitate and mediate between members.\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez agreed, saying she felt Mr. Cummings was \u201ccorrect in the procedure\u201d and was \u201ctrying to do everything in his power to protect\u201d Ms. Tlaib from being reprimanded. But, she added, women of color often face disparate treatment at work. \u201cAt the end of the day,\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said, \u201cone person got an apology and one person didn\u2019t, and two people were hurt.\u201d",

Elsewhere, an activist sweep on the left failed to materialize.By Alexander Burns and Jonathan MartinPRINT EDITIONBroad Urban-Rural Gap Troubling for the G.O.P.|August 9, 2018, Page A13",

      "content": "  The most significant harbinger from the Ohio race may not be the narrow margin, but the turnout gap between the most and least heavily populated parts of a district that absorbs the close-in suburbs of Columbus and rural stretches of central Ohio. In both Franklin County, which includes Columbus, and Delaware County, the fast-growing suburb just north of Ohio\u2019s capital, 42 percent of voters turned out. But in the five more lightly populated counties that round out the district, turnout ranged from 27 to 32 percent. This is an ominous sign for Republicans: The highest-income and best-educated elements of the electorate \u2014 those deeply uneasy with President Trump \u2014 are showing the most interest in voting. Defending a few dozen districts that are either more heavily urban or feature a similar demographic mix as Ohio\u2019s 12th District, Republicans will need to find a way to win back suburbanites or better galvanize rural voters. If they do not, their House majority will slip away. [Get full results from Ohio here.] The activist wing of the Democratic Party mobilized for several of the night\u2019s biggest races, trying to replicate the insurgent victory of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New York earlier this summer \u2014 and for the most part falling short. In Michigan, Abdul El-Sayed, a youthful candidate for governor backed by Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, lost a primary by about 20 percentage points to Gretchen Whitmer, a former Democratic leader in the state legislature. And in Missouri, Representative William Lacy Clay turned back a challenge from Cori Bush, who campaigned alongside Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and framed her candidacy in similar terms. The left still displayed real political force: Mr. El-Sayed and Ms. Bush both won more than 30 percent of the primary vote as underdog candidates. But the night was, on the whole, a display of strength by more conventional Democrats and a reminder that Democratic primary voters across the country are not necessarily motivated chiefly by liberal ideology. When Democrats captured a special House election in Pennsylvania earlier this year, they did so with a candidate who hailed from a well-known local political family, served as a Marine and did a stint as a federal prosecutor. Tall, clean-cut and proud to show off his skills with a rifle, Representative Conor Lamb \u201clooked the part,\u201d as Mr. Trump likes to say. Running in somewhat of a less forbidding district in Ohio on Tuesday, Danny O\u2019Connor, a 31-year-old county official, was hailed by Democrats for mounting a strong campaign. But he was no Conor Lamb. Mr. O\u2019Connor took a vacation out of the country after winning the primary this year, as some local Democrats noted. Far more important, he just did not have the sort of compelling biography that Mr. Lamb wielded. That may have made only a small difference, but it could prove decisive in an election that may be decided by fewer than 1,000 votes after absentee and provisional ballots are counted. Even in a turbocharged environment such as this for Democrats, candidates still matter. Ms. Whitmer was not the only woman to claim a major-party nomination for governor on Tuesday night. In Kansas, Democrats selected Laura Kelly, a state senator, to compete for the governorship in a red state where Republican strife may have created a political opening for Democrats. [Get full results from Kansas here.] Their victories bring to 11 the number of women nominated for governorships this year \u2014 a breakthrough in a political arena, executive offices, that has been especially unfriendly to women in the past. In some places, like Georgia and Maine, female candidates nominated this year could be the first women ever elected to lead their states. But that would not be the case in Michigan and Kansas: In both states, women have served as governors in the past. And in Kansas, Ms. Kelly won her primary with the help of one such former governor, Kathleen Sebelius, who supported her candidacy forcefully. After years of successive defeats across the Midwest, labor unions asserted themselves convincingly on Tuesday night. In Michigan, powerful unions led by the United Automobile Workers helped secure the Democratic gubernatorial nomination for Ms. Whitmer. And in Missouri, voters struck down a law that barred private-sector unions from collecting mandatory dues from workers who decline to become union members. The Missouri vote was a lopsided win for labor, with about two in three voters opposing the so-called right-to-work law. If the results were encouraging for unions, their bigger test will come in November, when candidates like Ms. Whitmer give them a chance to reclaim some power in states like Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin, where Republicans have controlled government for the better part of a decade and repeatedly used it to curtail union power.",

      "content": " MANASSAS, Va. \u2014 When the state of Virginia recently struck a deal with American chip maker Micron to expand in Manassas, both Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat, and the local mayor, Hal Parrish, a Republican, attended a ceremony celebrating the news. But not Lee Carter, the self-described socialist who represents this Virginia suburb in the state\u2019s House of Delegates. Instead, he blasted the deal on social media as \u201ccorrupt,\u201d noting that it gave the well-off company $70 million in government grants  to create 1,100 jobs. \u201cMicron doesn\u2019t need the money,\u201d Mr. Carter said in an interview, of one of the largest employers in his district. \u201cWe could have used it for something else.\u201d The recent midterm elections showcased the growing popularity of candidates who identify as socialists. Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, who were sworn in just weeks ago, have already attracted widespread attention as members of Congress. In state legislatures across the country, about a dozen newly elected socialists are also just embarking on their terms. But Mr. Carter, who won an unexpected victory in 2017 against a Republican who served as majority whip, has already served a year in office. And his tenure gives a glimpse of what happens when a dues-paying member of the Democratic Socialists of America is elected to office. Virginia politics has never before seen someone quite like Mr. Carter. In a state where Democrats and Republicans alike boast of being pro-business, Mr. Carter has waged a lonely battle against companies that seek funding from the public coffers, in addition to tax breaks, in exchange for bringing more business to Virginia. He has yet to see any of his bills passed. But he is part of a nascent movement in Virginia that is challenging the large influence that corporations typically enjoy in the state. Virginia is one of only a handful of states that allow corporations to donate unlimited amounts of money to politicians, and is the only state in the country that does not bar politicians from using those funds for personal expenses. \u201cWhat we have in Virginia is that lobbyists literally write the bills and present them,\u201d said Mark Keam, a Democratic delegate from Fairfax County who has served for nearly a decade. Mr. Carter has challenged his colleagues to represent ordinary people, not special interests, Mr. Keam said. \u201cThe one thing that Lee Carter has helped me understand is that labels don\u2019t matter very much. What matters is \u2018What do you stand for and what are you willing to fight for?\u2019\u201d The arrival last year of Mr. Carter and 14 other newly elected Democrats made it possible for Democrats to expand Medicaid. Now the party is aiming to take control of the state legislature this coming November, a goal that once seemed out of reach. The upcoming election also sets the stage for a struggle over Virginia\u2019s future between those who believe that prosperity lies in wooing more businesses and those like Mr. Carter, who believe it comes from making businesses share more of their wealth. While Virginia is the 12th largest economy in the country by gross domestic product, according to the Virginia Economic Development Partnership, it ranks 26th in income equality, according to the American Community Survey. Mr. Carter has been a vocal opponent of the incentive package, worth more than half a billion dollars, used to lure one of Amazon\u2019s new headquarters to Crystal City, Va. And he fought against a bill overhauling the state\u2019s energy grid, arguing that it gave away too much to Dominion, a powerful for-profit utility. In recent days, Mr. Carter filed a bill that would get rid of the union-weakening \u201cright to work\u201d statute that has been in place since 1947, as well as another bill that would give public employees, including teachers, the right to strike. He is the first to admit that these bills have little chance of passing this session, since Republicans hold a slim majority in both chambers of the state legislature, and even some Democrats oppose them. \u201cOne of the biggest things has been trying to keep in mind that by electing a socialist, my constituents have made the choice to reject the status quo,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want someone to go and fight, even if that person is on the losing end.\u201d But it is not clear how many of Mr. Carter\u2019s constituents know that he is a socialist. More than a dozen voters on the streets of Manassas expressed surprise to learn that the district is represented by a lawmaker who embraces that label. And although Mr. Carter sees his victory as proof that Northern Virginia wants radical change, others consider it a fluke. \u201cDemocrats could have nominated a dead cat and it probably would have won,\u201d said Mark J. Rozell, dean of the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University, noting that 2017 was the first opportunity to rebuke President Trump. So far, incentive packages for Micron and Amazon appear to have public support. At Olde Towne Auto Repair in Manassas, Robert Smith, a service manager, acknowledged that giving taxpayer money to wealthy companies was a \u201chard pill to swallow.\u201d But he insisted that it was worth it. \u201cThe whole country wants Amazon,\u201d he said. \u201cHow could that be bad for us?\u201d Still, Mr. Carter has attracted a nationwide following. Like Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, or \u201cAOC\u201d as her fans call her, he has forged a strong bond with struggling constituents by sharing his own financial troubles. A former Marine who depends on a G.I. Bill stipend to make ends meet, he admits that he pockets the $213 dollar per diem given to Virginia state lawmakers during the 46-day legislative session, staying at a friend\u2019s house instead of a hotel. Lawmakers are paid $17,640 a year for their work. Mr. Carter is uninterested in presenting a typical politician\u2019s varnished image. On Twitter, he has revealed every negative bit of personal information about himself that he can think of: He has been fired from jobs. He is still struggling to get his college degree. He is in the middle of a messy divorce from his third wife. Then there was this Twitter post, which caused the Virginia political establishment to clutch its collective pearls: \u201cJust like everyone else under 35, I\u2019m sure explicit images or video of me exists out there somewhere. That\u2019s just a reality of dating in the smartphone era.\u201d Mr. Carter said that airing his dirty laundry has focused his upcoming re-election race on what really matters: the economy. Now he says his Republican opponent, Councilman Ian Lovejoy of Manassas, has nothing to attack him about, except for socialism, a subject Mr. Carter says he welcomes. Mr. Lovejoy did not respond to messages seeking comment. Terry Kilgore, a Republican who leads the Commerce and Labor Committee, says he is confident that Virginians will choose to keep their pro-business policies and reject Mr. Carter\u2019s views in November. \u201cUnions, years ago, brought a lot of good things to the workplace, but now I think that society has evolved and workers are protected,\u201d said Mr. Kilgore, who hails from Gate City, a coal-mining town near the Tennessee border that has gotten redder over the last two decades, even as Mr. Carter\u2019s district has grown more blue. Republicans hoping to win back Mr. Carter\u2019s seat this fall have created pamphlets with his smiling face next to images of Lenin and Stalin. Some Democrats predict that he and other progressives will struggle to win re-election without a governor\u2019s race and a pro-business Democrat at the top of the ticket. But even those who disagree with Mr. Carter\u2019s stance on Amazon and Micron say he has elevated the level of public debate. \u201cHe will get up and say exactly what\u2019s on his mind, and he will say it in a very firm way and so people know exactly where he stands,\u201d said David Toscano, a Democratic delegate from Charlottesville who served as minority leader in the House from 2011 to 2018. At an event last month at the City Tavern in Manassas, Mr. Carter told a group of teachers about his bill that would give them the right to strike. \u201cOh really?\u201d Erin Merrill, a civics teacher seated next to him, replied. \u201cIt\u2019s going to die in subcommittee,\u201d Mr. Carter admitted. Ms. Merrill nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s a faraway thing,\u201d she said later. \u201cIf he starts now, he can build that coalition.\u201d",

      "author": "Astead W. Herndon",
      "content": " Representative Ayanna S. Pressley of Massachusetts, the only member of the group of progressive first-term congresswomen nicknamed \u201cthe squad\u201d who had not yet backed a Democratic presidential candidate, has endorsed Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a longtime ally. Ms. Pressley announced her decision in an email to supporters Wednesday afternoon, and released a corresponding video announcement. \u201cElizabeth has made it her life\u2019s work to pursue justice for working families and put economic and political power in the hands of people,\u201d Ms. Pressley said in a statement. \u201cWe find ourselves in a fight for the soul of our nation, and I know Elizabeth can win it.\u201d In choosing Ms. Warren, Ms. Pressley provided her home-state senator with her most high-profile congressional endorsement to this point, and avoided ruffling feathers in the closely-knit Massachusetts Democratic Party. She also split from her congressional cohort, as Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan all endorsed the race\u2019s other ardent progressive, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, last month. Ms. Pressley was elected to Congress last year, after a grass-roots, multiracial coalition lifted her to victory over Representative Michael E. Capuano in Boston\u2019s only majority-minority district. She was the first black woman elected to Congress from Massachusetts, and her endorsement gives Ms. Warren a prominent black surrogate in a campaign that must gain traction with black voters in order to overtake former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. in the race for the Democratic nomination. Ms. Warren has done significant outreach to black progressive groups and Democratic leaders over the past year \u2014 more than any other white candidate in the race. However, recent polls still show her trailing Mr. Biden among black voters by almost 30 points and she lags in South Carolina, the early primary state where black voters make up more than 60 percent of the electorate. \u201cI have seen Ms. Warren in small church basements and in packed gymnasiums,\u201d Ms. Pressley said in the video. \u201cAnd she is consistent. She never loses sight of the people.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve all heard about the senator\u2019s plans \u2014 but here\u2019s the thing,\u201d she added. \u201cHer plans are about power: who has it, who refuses to let it go, and who deserves more of it.\u201d The endorsement was a must-have for Ms. Warren, who has risen sharply in polls and fund-raising over the last six months but has lagged in some traditional measures of party support, including endorsements from governors, big-city mayors, or fellow senators outside Massachusetts. In recent weeks her campaign has sought to reverse that trend by lining up endorsements from anti-establishment progressive champions popular among the party\u2019s left wing. Representative Katie Porter of California endorsed Ms. Warren over her home-state legislator, Senator Kamala Harris of California. Mayor Jim Kenney of Philadelphia announced his support for Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign last month, her first endorsement from a big-city mayor. Ms. Warren also recently rolled out endorsements from two of the country\u2019s most progressive district attorneys: Larry Krasner of Philadelphia and Rachael Rollins of Suffolk County in Massachusetts. Mr. Krasner, who supported Mr. Sanders in 2016, received some blowback for endorsing Ms. Warren over Mr. Sanders, who remains in striking distance in most polls. \u201cI have not forgotten and no one should forget that Bernie Sanders, early in his prior campaign for president, said the only reason he ran was that he couldn\u2019t persuade his friend Elizabeth Warren to run for president,\u201d Mr. Krasner said in response. \u201cI heard what he said, and I remembered what he said.\u201d While Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, Ms. Omar, and Ms. Tlaib have become household names partly out of their willingness to upset the Democratic establishment, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Ms. Pressley has gained a reputation as a cautious Capitol Hill operator. Ms. Pressley, 45, was the first nonwhite woman elected to the Boston City Council in 2009 and had a robust local constituency before being elected to Congress. Unlike newcomers like Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, who speaks about how Mr. Sanders\u2019s presidential run in 2016 helped motivate her to seek elected office, Ms. Pressley was a delegate for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election and has close relationships with the party\u2019s traditional power brokers. She is also considered a prospective candidate for Ms. Warren\u2019s Senate seat should Ms. Warren win the White House. Some in Massachusetts have speculated that Ms. Pressley could play the role of television surrogate for Ms. Warren, serving as a progressive ally who would implicitly counteract perceptions of her campaign as geared toward white elites. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, Ms. Omar, and Ms. Tlaib are helping play a similar role for Mr. Sanders, and have held rallies with him in their respective home districts of New York City, Minneapolis, and Detroit. In Massachusetts, where the congressional delegation only comprises Democrats and where a contentious Senate primary is currently underway, Ms. Pressley\u2019s endorsement speaks to the high-stakes political game of who to back \u2014 and when. Ms. Pressley was not a part of the initial round of home-state endorsements during Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign launch earlier this year, leading to speculation that she would sit out the presidential primary or back Ms. Harris, the 2020 race\u2019s only black woman. Instead, Ms. Pressley joined Ms. Warren\u2019s cause, politically cementing the informal friendship that has existed among them for years. In 2018, when Ms. Pressley announced plans to run against Mr. Capuano, Ms. Warren stayed out of the race \u2014 a sign the grass-roots campaign Ms. Pressley had built was exceeding expectations. Now, it\u2019s Ms. Pressley playing power broker, as Ms. Warren seeks to usurp the establishment herself.",

HerndonPRINT EDITIONHow Shuttering ICE Went From Fringe to Platform|June 30, 2018, Page A11",
      "author": "Sydney Ember",
      "content": "  Abolish ICE! That was the seemingly radical message that Chardo Richardson, a House candidate in Florida, published in an online statement four months ago, endorsing a call to eliminate the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. \u201cImmigrants are some of the most courageous and industrious people humanity has to offer,\u201d he wrote in an introduction to the immigration platform of Brand New Congress, a grass-roots progressive organization. \u201cWe can only benefit from their presence.\u201d To that point, the idea had largely been passed around on social media; among political candidates, Mr. Richardson was something of a lonely voice. But in the months since \u2014 as startling images emerged from the border of migrant children separated from their parents \u2014 the call to abolish or defund the agency has gained momentum in the midterm campaigns. Case in point: the shocking victory on Tuesday by an insurgent primary candidate in New York, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who had made abolishing ICE a part of her platform. From Massachusetts to Hawaii, progressive candidates undeterred by the immense obstacles to eliminating a federal agency have peppered Twitter with hashtags of support. Deb Haaland, a Native American who stunned the New Mexico political establishment with a House primary victory early this month, supports the idea. A Florida candidate, Matt Haggman, cut a campaign ad promising to \u201cclose ICE down.\u201d Cynthia Nixon, who is running for governor in New York, has called the immigration agency a \u201cterrorist organization.\u201d \u201cWe should abolish ICE,\u201d Mr. Richardson said in an interview this week, with the conviction of a politician who believes he has a winning idea. \u201cICE is terrorizing our communities.\u201d Political strategists point out the inherent risk in the movement: that Republicans will use it to portray Democrats as extremists who are weak on border control. \u201cThe other side is using the slogan to communicate to the country that this is a debate about open borders,\u201d said Cecilia Mu\u00f1oz, former director of the White House\u2019s Domestic Policy Council under President Obama. Still, the idea has been gaining momentum as a rallying cry of the far left, and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s upset victory over an establishment Democrat gave it a newfound political currency. Then, on Thursday night, just hours after hundreds of immigration protesters had chanted \u201cabolish ICE\u201d on Capitol Hill, Kirsten Gillibrand became the first sitting senator to directly support the agency\u2019s elimination. \u201cI believe you should get rid of it, start over, reimagine it and build something that actually works,\u201d Ms. Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, said on CNN. She later shared the message on Twitter. It was a powerful gesture, coming from a prominent Democrat who is also considered a possible 2020 presidential contender, and one that could inspire more high-profile politicians to back the idea. (Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York City added his support Friday morning.) Notably, Senator Gillibrand had backed Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s opponent, the Democratic stalwart Joseph Crowley, in the primary. The call to abolish ICE remains a largely rhetorical, activist position with questionable feasibility. Top Democratic leaders have not adopted the position, and only a handful of other sitting politicians have embraced it to this point. But fueled by continued anger over the crisis at the border, the movement to abolish ICE is taking hold as an important policy issue for the Democratic Party\u2019s progressive wing. Driven more by their ideology than any concrete political calculus, a small but rising number of progressive candidates are unabashedly pushing the proposal. Some Democrats point to other progressive proposals that were once similarly dismissed by party leaders but have since gained traction among mainstream Democrats, like Medicare for all and tuition-free public college. The hope among grass-roots activists is that progressive energy will give these same people the political cover to embrace an abolish-ICE policy that has mostly thrived on the fringe. \u201cICE operates through the tactics of fear, violence and intimidation, with questionable legality, and tears families apart,\u201d Stephanie Taylor, a founder of the liberal organization Progressive Change Campaign Committee, said in a statement. \u201cWe applaud the growing number of progressives who are calling for an end to this terror.\u201d Their ICE proposal, these progressives hope, could also help galvanize voters in the summer\u2019s remaining primaries and November\u2019s general elections. Some of those who support the position said in interviews that they were especially encouraged by Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s victory. But while the movement is gaining strength, it has also drawn attention from the right, which has seized on it to bludgeon the Democrats. In an interview on Wednesday with Politico, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, referred to the Democratic Party as \u201cself-avowed socialists\u201d who wanted \u201copen borders.\u201d Kellyanne Conway, the White House counselor, has also sought to use the progressive rallying against Democrats. \u201cEvery Democratic candidate could be asked now, maybe, \u2018Do you agree or disagree with the new face of the Democratic Party that we should abolish Immigration and Customs and Enforcement?\u2019\u201d Ms. Conway said Wednesday on Fox News. Still, there are indications the proposal is reverberating in the halls of Washington. This week, Representative Mark Pocan of Wisconsin said he planned to introduce legislation to abolish the immigration agency. In an interview, he said that he had received support for the bill from fellow Democratic House members including Pramila Jayapal of Washington, Earl Blumenauer of Oregon and Jim McGovern of Massachusetts. \u201cI think that you will see more support for it just because this really gets at addressing the core abuses by the administration,\u201d Mr. Pocan said. Little polling exists on whether Americans support the complete shuttering of ICE\u2019s operations, but recent data does show that President Trump\u2019s nativist push to limit both legal and illegal immigration is at odds with public opinion. A Pew Research Center poll released Wednesday said that about 70 percent of Americans want legal immigration to at least stay at its present level, but more Americans support its increase than its decrease. A Quinnipiac University poll of American voters found that 50 percent of Americans think the Trump administration has been too aggressive in deportations. One potential problem is that the abolish-ICE movement could further divide the Democratic Party as it looks to project a unified message heading into the midterms and, beyond that, the 2020 presidential campaign. Eliminating a federal agency is a position that leaves little room for compromise, and moderate Democrats who do not support the proposal risk drawing the ire of the very vocal far left, which already views the party establishment as slow to embrace their ideals. Strategists and legal experts say the position could also be difficult to pass, especially if it continues to be a partisan issue. \u201cIt would require us to think about immigration policy from a very different perspective, but I think it is possible,\u201d said Sameera Hafiz, a senior political strategist at the Immigrant Legal Resource Center. Supporters of abolishing ICE are vocal, their call magnified by social media, but they have offered few concrete plans. Mr. Pocan of Wisconsin said his bill would create a commission that would examine ICE to determine which of its roles should be performed by other agencies. At this point, however, the issue is still largely the province of the far reaches of the far left. Even progressives do not agree on the elimination proposal. \u201cI don\u2019t know that abolishing ICE solves anything,\u201d said Veronica Escobar, a progressive who is running for Congress in Texas\u2019s 16th district, which lies along the Mexican border. \u201cThe fact of the matter is that ICE does do some things that are necessary to keep the country safe.\u201d Ms. Escobar cited in particular ICE\u2019s work investigating child predators and human trafficking, a point she echoed in a lengthy Facebook post. The obstacles to eliminating ICE do not deter groups like Brand New Congress, the grass-roots organization that included abolishing the agency in its November 2017 immigration platform, and has encouraged young social activists like Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and Mr. Richardson of Florida to run for federal office. The group\u2019s education materials cite the enormous fiscal burden of immigration enforcement, and also assert that other government agencies can do the watchdog work of immigration enforcement with clearer oversight. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s victory has only energized the effort. \u201cAs long as progressives keep winning elections and keep pushing the issue and refuse to let the issue of abolishing ICE go, it will become a bigger issue for Democrats,\u201d said Sarah Smith, who is running for Congress in Washington. \u201cThis is just another one of those issues where we have to strong-arm them into listening to us.\u201d",

      "author": "Michael Tackett",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump has proved himself adroit at creating villains to serve as his political foils. In his State of the Union address on Tuesday, he introduced a new one: socialists. Right after his calls to support the overthrow of Venezuela\u2019s president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, and condemning the \u201csocialist policies\u201d that have reduced the country \u201cinto a state of abject poverty and despair,\u201d he made a quick segue to the home front. \u201cHere in the United States, we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country,\u201d the president said, adding, \u201cTonight, we resolve that America will never be a socialist country.\u201d Tuesday night\u2019s speech contained more than a few suggestions of what Mr. Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign could look like. The president dwelled on the economy, pointing to the low unemployment rate, continuing growth and the tax cut passed by the last Republican Congress. He spoke of trying to reduce prescription drug costs and battling H.I.V., perhaps with an eye to the kinds of suburban female voters who deserted Republicans in the midterm elections. And for his hard-core followers, he argued for the border wall. The threat of socialism was something new. But it could become the kind of rhetorical touchstone of his re-election campaign that sounding the alarm about \u201ccriminal illegal aliens\u201d was in 2016. If it does, it could provide Mr. Trump with a potentially effective weapon in confronting an increasingly aggressive and more liberal Democratic Party, defining it through attacks on Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, who describe themselves as democratic socialists, and other members of the party pushing progressive policies like a 70 percent tax rate and \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d The president\u2019s economic advisers began sounding the socialist alarm in the fall in a 72-page report criticizing what it described as the socialist ideas of leading Democrats, linking them with the failed economic policies of communist governments in China, the former Soviet Union and other countries. The word \u201csocialism\u201d appeared 144 times \u2014 on average, twice a page. The report by the White House Council of Economic Advisers, \u201cThe Opportunity Costs of Socialism,\u201d did not prescribe any action but was meant to serve as a warning about the destructive economic policies that Mr. Trump believes Democrats would inflict on the United States. Policies like tuition-free college were mentioned in the same ominous tone as the atrocities committed by Vladimir Lenin and Mao Zedong. The report suggested that Democratic policies emulating Venezuela would cause the American economy to shrink by 40 percent, just as Mr. Trump did on Tuesday night. Yet there is no evidence of any growing public angst about socialism sweeping the United States. As a political philosophy and organizing tool, it took modest root in the country in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but never gained widespread appeal. Eugene V. Debs, a labor leader from Terre Haute, Ind., was a five-time candidate for president, never to great effect, peaking at 6 percent of the vote in 1912. \u201cYou really have not had a self-consciously socialist movement of any size and influence since the 1930s,\u201d said Michael Kazin, a professor of history at Georgetown University and the author of a history of the American left. \u201cClearly this is an attempt to portray Democrats as too radical for Americans and to connect them to Venezuela, which is of course a clever thing do since Venezuela is falling apart under an ostensibly socialist government.\u201d But the supposed threat of creeping socialism \u2014 and the dangers posed by someone like Ms. Ocasio-Cortez \u2014 have become favorite talking points for conservatives like the TV personality Sean Hannity of Fox News, who tells his viewers that far-left socialism had taken over the Democratic Party. Mr. Trump is now firmly aligned with that view. \u201cMost Americans are obviously not up on the distinctions between democratic socialists and communists,\u201d Mr. Kazin said. \u201cHe, like other conservatives who had talked about the so-called Red Menace over the years, is trying to confuse the two things in people\u2019s minds.\u201d But that is not how conservatives look at the way Mr. Trump seems ready to portray Democrats. \u201cFrom a political standpoint, he is defending free enterprise, free markets and freedom,\u201d said Greg Mueller, a conservative strategist. \u201cThey want to take the country toward socialism and their party is divided on that and there is a major fight in their party over whether to be a socialist party. \u201cThis is a great debate for Trump to define in 2019 and the 2020 campaign,\u201d he added. Republicans, with limited success, tried at times to label President Barack Obama a socialist, particularly for his call for higher taxes on the wealthy, Mr. Kazin said, noting that this effort coincided with a shift in public opinion where Americans viewed socialism more favorably. But a Gallup poll in August showed that Democrats had a more positive view of socialism than they do of capitalism, 57 percent to 47 percent. Their view has been relatively stable since 2010, but attitudes toward capitalism have become more negative, coinciding with the financial crisis that fueled animus toward the large banks and investment firms blamed for the economic devastation. Among Americans ages 18 to 29, the Gallup poll found, 51 percent were positive about socialism while 45 percent viewed capitalism favorably. Gallup noted there was a marked, 12-point decline in younger adults views on capitalism is just two years. \u201cEvery single policy proposal that we have adopted and presented to the American people has been overwhelmingly popular,\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez told MSNBC late Tuesday. And she dismissed Mr. Trump\u2019s criticism. \u201cHe feels himself losing on the issues,\u201d she said, and now must engage in ad hominem attacks. But it was no accident that Mr. Trump chose to introduce the socialist menace in perhaps the highest-profile setting available to a president as the first step in trying to paint Democrats as too far left, just as they start to engage in a presidential nominating process that will shape the party\u2019s image. And even some of the president\u2019s harshest critics say he may be on to something. \u201cThe idea of throwing the socialist thing out there politically is pretty crafty because, truly, there is just enough truth in there to make it sticky and interesting,\u201d said Mike Murphy, a Republican strategist and longtime Trump critic. \u201cThey are lurching left. For once, somehow, a little honesty crept into one of Trump\u2019s proclamations. It\u2019s code for the loony left.\u201d",

      "author": "Alexander Burns",
      "content": "   It was a night of rebellion among Democrats and loyalty for Republicans: Liberal activists upended the Democratic establishment in multiple primary races on Tuesday, while Republican voters backed candidates anointed by President Trump. The night broke the pattern of the last few years, when Republicans often challenged their leaders and Democrats usually fell in line. Here are some of our takeaways: A political revolution \u2014 or something like it \u2014 just rippled through New York City. The defeat of Representative Joseph Crowley in a Democratic primary qualifies as an unheard-of event: A powerful lawmaker, who controlled the Queens Democratic Party and was seen as a potential speaker of the House, crumbled against a challenge from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a 28-year-old liberal activist and first-time candidate who was backed by a few national progressive groups. Her victory is a stunning illustration of the energy on the left this year, and an echo of the Republican primaries in 2014 that saw another aspiring speaker of the House, Eric Cantor of Virginia, felled by an upstart on the right. But Ms. Ocasio-Cortez was not the only liberal insurgent \u2014 or the only young candidate of color \u2014 to rattle the entrenched Democrats in the city. In Brooklyn, Adem Bunkeddeko nearly unseated Representative Yvette Clarke, a veteran incumbent from a local dynasty; he lost by barely 1,000 votes. And Representative Carolyn Maloney drew less than three-fifths of the vote against another first-time candidate, Suraj Patel. Establishment-backed Democrats fared better elsewhere, including a contentious House primary in Colorado. But the unrest in New York City is a landmark moment: For all its cultural liberalism, the city is usually a politically rigid place \u2014 a tough arena for newcomers, given the party machines and election laws that discourage competition. On Tuesday night, the ossified Democratic institutions got a new kind of scare. And one of the very methods New York\u2019s Democratic establishment uses to maintain its grip \u2014 separating federal and state primaries to better control the electorate \u2014 could now come back to haunt them. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s triumph will deliver an injection of money and energy into Cynthia Nixon\u2019s challenge to Gov. Andrew Cuomo, offering her the sort of momentum going into the September primary that she might not have had were it not for the state\u2019s bifurcated nominating process. For congressional Democrats who are eager to replace Representative Nancy Pelosi and the rest of the septuagenarian House leadership team, Mr. Crowley, at 56, had offered the promise of a generational transition. That hope vanished with his defeat, and now the race to replace Ms. Pelosi \u2014 whether this year or in the future \u2014 is wide open. On the surface, Mr. Crowley\u2019s exit means Ms. Pelosi has one less potential rival looming in the wings. But the vacuum he has created could also present new challenges to the California Democrat\u2019s grip on the House caucus, which is already threatened because so many of her party\u2019s candidates have promised not to back her. Other younger, ambitious lawmakers may fill the void left by Mr. Crowley \u2014 and that list seems bound to include Democrats who are not white men. With Mr. Crowley and her second-in-command, Representative Steny Hoyer, Ms. Pelosi knew who could threaten her. Now it is not clear where an insurgency may come from. [Our Politics editor is answering readers\u2019 questions about our political coverage. Submit your questions here.] A stunning thing happened in New York, yes \u2014 just not where many assumed it would. Former Representative Michael Grimm\u2019s redemption run for the House \u2014 which took him from federal prison to a strong public polling lead in his bid to reclaim his old seat \u2014 was supposed to be another data point in the meme-able Trump-era political conceit that \u201cnothing matters.\u201d Mr. Grimm had gone to jail. The president endorsed his opponent, Representative Dan Donovan. Virtually every other meaningful Republican in the area did, too. Mr. Donovan held a sizable fund-raising advantage in their primary. And yet, many assumed Mr. Grimm was the favorite, neutralizing Mr. Donovan\u2019s advantages with his Trump-style swagger and relentless ubiquity at diners and borough functions. But on Tuesday, at least some of those other factors seemed to matter. At the polls, some voters cited the Trump endorsement as decisive in their choice; others said they worried about Mr. Grimm\u2019s viability in the fall against the Democratic nominee, Max Rose, a well-funded veteran. Whatever the reason, there was something striking about an entirely explicable outcome for a change: A generally unassuming incumbent defeated a disgraced former officeholder by a considerable margin. A sitting president made a difference for a current member of Congress. It all added up, in one corner of the city, at least. It is not yet clear if a Senator Mitt Romney would be a loyal foot soldier in Mr. Trump\u2019s Washington \u2014 as his recent conduct has often suggested \u2014 or a high-profile executive irritant, as his criticisms of then-candidate Trump during the 2016 campaign might imply. But on Tuesday, this much was obvious: There will almost certainly be a Senator Mitt Romney. After a disappointing showing at the Utah Republican convention in April \u2014 and amid sporadic concerns that his past attacks on Mr. Trump might alienate some voters in Mr. Romney\u2019s adopted state \u2014 the former Massachusetts governor and presidential candidate won his Senate primary handily, clearing the way for what is expected to be an uneventful general election contest in a solidly red state. With the upcoming retirements of Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona and Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, and the recent Republican primary loss for Representative Mark Sanford of South Carolina, the next Congress seems likely to have fewer notable skeptics of Mr. Trump in the Republican ranks. Barring a major surprise before November, Mr. Romney will have the opportunity to fill the void, if he is so inclined.",

      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 Freshman orientation for new members of Congress had barely begun when Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the 29-year-old darling of the progressive left and newly elected congresswoman from New York, visited Nancy Pelosi\u2019s office for the first time. She was not there to meet the House Democratic leader. She was there to protest. \u201cThis is not about personality, this is not about rebuke, this is not about confrontation \u2014 it\u2019s about making sure that we are getting the job done,\u201d she declared, moments before she spoke to young activists who staged a sit-in to demand a Green New Deal to address climate change. Of Ms. Pelosi, she said, \u201cI think she really appreciates civic engagement.\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s noisy Washington debut, and her uncanny knack for grabbing the spotlight, underscores the difficulties that await Democratic leaders as they try to unify an unusually diverse incoming class. Newcomers in both parties descended on the capital Tuesday for the start of a biennial Washington rite \u2014 freshman orientation \u2014 that seems unusually freighted with seriousness in the age of President Trump. Going to Congress is typically like going to college. Newcomers make new friends, look for housing, pick up new cellphones (this year, they are also being issued iPads) and take pictures for their temporary ID badges, to be replaced by House pins once they are sworn in. They take nonpartisan seminars about the nuts and bolts of joining Congress \u2014 how to hire staff and set up an office. And they go to parties, lots of parties, which members of Congress prefer to call \u201creceptions.\u201d But as Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s participation in the protest made clear, these are not typical times in Washington. Members of the Class of 2018, especially the Democrats who are wrestling with how much to cooperate with Mr. Trump \u2014 as opposed to investigating him \u2014 say they feel an acute sense that the country is at a precarious moment. \u201cI feel a pretty heavy burden,\u201d said Tom Malinowski, a human rights advocate, former State Department official and freshman Democrat from New Jersey. \u201cWe were the difference makers in this election, at a moment when it really does feel as if the most fundamental norms of our democracy are hanging in the balance.\u201d (Some others, who have lost their seats, apparently feel their own burdens being lifted. Representative Dana Rohrabacher, a 15-term Republican of California, was seen wandering the Capitol in cargo pants.) Then there is the bitterness of Capitol Hill, not exactly a mirror of freshman-year jitters at college. Deb Haaland, a newly elected Democrat from New Mexico who is one of the first Native American women to serve in Congress, bumped into a Republican freshman in an elevator at their hotel, and introduced herself. He said it was nice to meet her, then followed up: \u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be at each others\u2019 throats eventually.\u201d Ms. Haaland, taken aback, replied, \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d For many \u2014 even those with deep Washington experience \u2014 arriving in the capital is something of a culture shock. Elissa Slotkin, a Democratic first-time candidate and former C.I.A. officer who worked in the administrations of George W. Bush and Barack Obama, is now a congresswoman-elect from Michigan, having narrowly defeated a Republican incumbent. After 18 months on the campaign trail at home, she is having to adjust to the topics that people in Washington discuss. \u201cThose of us that successfully flipped districts did so by focusing on very local issues and not on Washington stories,\u201d she said. \u201cSo you come to Washington, and this place is like an echo chamber, and everybody\u2019s just sort of bouncing off each other on Trump, Trump, Trump \u2014 and no one\u2019s talking about the issues that really matter to people\u2019s pocket books.\u201d Tim Burchett, a newly elected Republican of Tennessee, was just trying to find his way around. \u201cI\u2019m from Knoxville, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said. \u201cThe longest I\u2019ve ever been in D.C. was in 1976 when I was a patrol boy.\u201d And that, he said, was when he was in the sixth grade. Another Republican, Pete Stauber of Minnesota, simply sounded awe-struck: \u201cI\u2019m humbled beyond imagination.\u201d So far, there are 87 members of the new freshman class: 56 Democrats and 31 Republicans. The Democrats mostly represent a triumphant political wave; the Republicans mainly occupy the seats of a different kind of wave, retirees. An additional 9 candidates \u2014 eight Democrats and one Republican \u2014 whose races are still hanging in the balance are also in town for orientation. They are cloistered at a heavily guarded hotel in southeast Washington. The orientation, run by the House Committee on Administration, will last two weeks, with a weeklong Thanksgiving break in between. Representative Zoe Lofgren, Democrat of California, and the committee\u2019s incoming chairwoman, said that in addition to the usual sessions on hiring and ethics rules, lawmakers will receive extensive training this year on how to prevent and respond to sexual harassment \u2014 a response to a string of scandals that prompted the House to change its rules last year. Senior lawmakers who are eager to rise up the leadership ranks use orientation for another reason: to court and count votes. Ms. Pelosi, who already made history as the first female speaker, now hopes to return to that job. On Tuesday, she courted hard during an event she hosted at Osteria Morini, an upscale Italian restaurant on Washington\u2019s newly redeveloped waterfront. Behind its glass windows, she could be seen entertaining a mix of incoming and incumbent representatives, who chatted over drinks and hors d\u2019oeuvres and posed for pictures with one another. The event, one of several on Tuesday, was also an opportunity for other representatives to formally meet their new colleagues. \u201cMax, proud of you, bro,\u201d Representative Charlie Crist of Florida yelled outside the restaurant as he spotted Max Rose, who pulled off an upset on Election Day on New York\u2019s Staten Island. \u201cProud of you.\u201d \u201cI couldn\u2019t be more excited to see you,\u201d Mr. Rose said, beaming as the pair embraced in the cold. Though Ms. Pelosi reached out with congratulatory calls and has begun meeting with some of the incoming members, her reception offered an opportunity for several of the new representatives to meet her in person. Many have yet to fully endorse Ms. Pelosi\u2019s bid to reclaim the speaker\u2019s gavel. \u201cOh, gosh, I haven\u2019t decided,\u201d said Dr. Kim Schrier, who flipped a Seattle-area district long held by Representative Dave Reichert, who is retiring. \u201cI\u2019m just getting my sea legs.\u201d But one Washington veteran, Donna Shalala, the newly elected congresswoman from South Florida, did not hesitate to offer her endorsement. \u201cShe\u2019s a skilled leader, she can manage the caucus, which is complicated, and frankly she is responsible for passing Obamacare,\u201d said Ms. Shalala, who served as health secretary to former President Bill Clinton and is, at 77, likely the oldest freshman. The youngest freshman, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, could be spotted inside, posing for pictures.",

      "content": "Good Wednesday morning. Here are some of the stories making news in Washington and politics today. \u2022 The Department of Education has reopened a civil rights case against Rutgers University that the Obama administration had closed. The move injected federal authority into the campus battles over Israel, equating opposition to Zionism with  anti-Semitism and defining Judaism as an ethnicity as well as a religion. \u2022 Pressure is intensifying on undecided senators before a vote to confirm President Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee. Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said she has been targeted with a barrage of calls, some using vulgar language and threats, to push her to vote against Judge Brett Kavanaugh. \u2022 According to Donald Trump Jr., the president\u2019s anxiety about whom he can trust has only increased in the days since anonymous administration members laid out in stark detail concerns about his ability to lead. \u2022 A broad group of governors, mayors and business executives declared last year that they would uphold the Paris climate deal, making a case to the rest of the world that they, and not the president, spoke for the nation. Now the group is at a critical juncture, the moment when it shows whether or not it can rise to the task. \u2022 The House of Representatives is growing increasingly diverse. But of the 40 top Democratic and Republican aides who lead the staffs of House committees, only six are nonwhite, according to researchers at a Washington think tank. Ayanna Pressley\u2019s blowout victory over a 10-term congressman last week was the latest example of a trend that has become abundantly clear: 2018 is the year of the progressive insurgent, from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to Andrew Gillum. But if you relied exclusively on polls, you may not have seen these results coming. A survey conducted in late July, more than a month before the election, showed Ms. Pressley losing by 13 percentage points; she ended up winning by 17. The last poll conducted by Representative Joseph Crowley showed him beating Ms. Ocasio-Cortez by 36 percentage points, but she ended up beating him by 15 in June. We asked four experts what could have made the polls seem so wrong. Some of it, they said, had to do with capturing the grass-roots energy of 2018. But much of the trouble is more mundane: Primaries are just really hard to predict.

      "author": "Catie Edmondson",
      "content": "   WASHINGTON \u2014 It took less than 48 hours into the new Congress for some of the most liberal freshmen of the now Democratic-controlled House to upend Capitol Hill \u2014 and they see no reason to slow down. They have pressed for an ambitious and costly climate change proposal that would eliminate the use of fossil fuels in 12 years and provide a job to anyone who wants one. After conservatives tried to embarrass Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York with old footage of her dancing, she faced them down by videotaping new footage of her dancing \u2014 outside her new congressional office. Between dance numbers and knowing Instagram posts, she tried \u2014 and failed \u2014 to beat back an obscure austerity measure for the incoming Congress, and she floated plans to tax the extremely wealthy by as much as 70 percent. In the meantime, her freshman classmate Representative Rashida Tlaib of Michigan was unapologetically upsetting Democratic talking points with an exuberant, expletive-filled pledge to impeach the president. \u201cCongresswoman Tlaib was elected to shake up Washington, not continue the status quo,\u201d her office said in a statement standing by her remarks even as President Trump was denouncing them, and her, on national television. In case it wasn\u2019t already clear, the insurgent freshmen who promised bold and uncompromising action, uninterested in and unbowed by the strictures of the status quo, are showing no signs of wavering. They appear determined to push their party to the left, even as more experienced lawmakers fear that their antics and programs could divide the party and empower Republicans. \u201cI think some lessons will be learned pretty quickly around here,\u201d Representative Dina Titus, Democrat of Nevada and a former professor of political science, said after Ms. Tlaib\u2019s profane outburst. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to hand the gun for the other side to shoot you with.\u201d The 2019 freshmen are hardly the first incoming class to come in swinging. The \u201cWatergate babies\u201d of 1975 came in with a mandate to clean up government. Newt Gingrich\u2019s Republican Revolutionaries of 1995 and the Tea Party class of 2011 believed they had a mandate for conservative change; what they lacked in realism, they made up for in moxie. This new class has deeper ideological divisions, but its liberal wing is in the spotlight, thanks to the iPhone video-Instagram generation that powered its ascent. Its reach, as of yet, has gone only so far, though. Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who took pains to welcome the freshmen and praise their victories, must also attend to the demands of more moderate lawmakers whose victories in Republican districts sealed the party\u2019s majority \u2014 and whose re-elections are necessary to keep it. Ms. Pelosi has curtailed many of the insurgent progressives\u2019 demands. For instance, she held off on tasking a new climate change committee with a mandate to produce a \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d and deprived it of subpoena power. She also put down an insurrection designed to block the reinstatement of so-called pay-as-you-go rules that require new spending to be offset by equal spending cuts or tax increases. The speaker assuaged liberals with an assurance that they could waive pay-as-you-go for legislative priorities, and she agreed to hearings for their \u201cMedicare for All\u201d single-payer health plan. But the newcomers\u2019 mix of bold policy proposals and lighthearted personas has caught the nation\u2019s attention \u2014 on Friday, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, 29, the youngest lawmaker in the chamber, surpassed Ms. Pelosi in Twitter followers. Their savvy, almost Trumpian use of social media may not pass a national health plan or a 70 percent income tax bracket, but it has helped muscle the policy conversation into the national discourse, and has nudged the party to the left. Representative Jackie Speier of California, one of the more senior women in the House, praised the new women for \u201cinvigorating the Congress\u201d and \u201chaving the guts to say these rules don\u2019t make any sense.\u201d Nodding toward their tools of communication, she added, \u201cI think what we\u2019ve learned from President Trump is that people like authenticity.\u201d The comparison to Mr. Trump may rankle, but their policy proposals bring to mind the Tea Party class of 2011, whose hard-right positions moved the Republican Party by making traditionally conservative proposals seem more moderate. \u201cIn many ways, the positions that very progressive caucus members take help provide space for us to get to yes on some hard issues for folks,\u201d said Representative Dan Kildee, Democrat of Michigan. But there is concern. Liberal messaging bills with no legislative prospects will not be helpful, said Representative Cheri Bustos of Illinois, one of more than two dozen Democrats elected in Trump districts and the new head of the House Democrats\u2019 campaign arm. \u201cIf I have any say to what happens legislatively, it\u2019s that we get something done.\u201d Several of the freshman proposals are not particularly new. For years, liberals have demanded greater attention to climate change. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont made Medicare for All central to his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016. But they are adding a youthful veneer. \u201cIt\u2019s not that they own it all by themselves,\u201d said Representative Alan Lowenthal, Democrat of California. The new efforts, he added, are \u201cpushing people who were ready to be pushed.\u201d The downside of their undisciplined messaging power was on display Friday, as Ms. Tlaib\u2019s impeachment comments ricocheted from the internet to the political conversation and overshadowed the rollout of the House Democrats\u2019 first legislative priority, an ambitious overhaul of ethics and accountability measures. Instead of answering questions about the proposal, Democrats were forced to critique their newly sworn-in colleague, just as Republicans have been answerable to Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets. \u201cYou cannot accomplish much of anything unless you have civility and show respect for your colleagues,\u201d Representative Elijah Cummings of Maryland, chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, told reporters. The comments gave Republicans already irked by the progressive freshmen perhaps the most substantive fodder to date. Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the Republicans\u2019 messaging leader, warned anew of the foothold that Democratic \u201cradicals\u201d were gaining in the House. \u201cPelosi\u2019s got her first test, and it happened on Day 1: How is she going to stand up to the most radical left elements of her party when they become unhinged?\u201d said Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the No. 2 House Republican. The kerfuffle is likely to be swamped by the coming fights over policy. The freshmen are teaming up with other liberals like Representatives Pramila Jayapal and Ro Khanna to make another run at repealing pay-as-you-go, arguing that Republicans put no such limits on themselves when they cut taxes by $1.5 trillion in 2017 or created the prescription drug benefit for Medicare in 2003. Ms. Tlaib and Representative Ilhan Omar, Democrat of Minnesota, have threatened to take aim at the longstanding pro-Israel positions of both parties. But no issue might be as problematic for Democrats as climate change, specifically how far the House should go to combat it when the Senate is in Republican hands, headed by a majority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell, who jealously guards the coal interests of his state, Kentucky. After two years of railing against Mr. Trump for denying the established science of climate change, Democrats are eager to make a difference on global warming. There\u2019s little unity, however, over how to do it. A number of lawmakers have embraced a \u201cGreen New Deal,\u201d an ambitious, still vague climate stimulus package inspired by the programs that Franklin D. Roosevelt created to pull the United States out of the Great Depression. \u201cThis is going to be the New Deal, the Great Society, the moon shot, the civil rights movement of our generation,\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said at a recent town-hall-style event. But Ms. Ocasio-Cortez won\u2019t be leading the climate change panel. Instead, Ms. Pelosi has tapped Representative Kathy Castor of Florida. She also sidestepped demands from progressives that the panel be specifically tasked with fleshing out the details of the Green New Deal, a move that Ms. Ocasio-Cortez publicly pilloried. In an interview, Ms. Castor had only praise for the freshmen\u2019s efforts on climate change, calling them \u201ctransformative.\u201d \u201cPart of the message is, \u2018No way, we do not have time for climate deniers, and we\u2019re going to press on,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cYes, they\u2019re going to be pressing Democrats here, but I see a huge movement underway. This is our moment, and we need this youthful energy.\u201d But Ms. Castor has history to worry about. In 2009 and 2010, House Democrats embraced a more market-oriented approach to climate change that would have capped the emissions of climate-warming carbon dioxide and had companies trade credits to allow some to emit more than others, as long as overall emissions declined. Former Representative Henry Waxman, one of the bill\u2019s authors, noted that the legislation was based on a plan developed by a coalition of leading environmental and business groups, including members of the fossil fuel industry, to encourage Republican support. \u201cIt turned out we were wrong. Republicans didn\u2019t care at all what business interests had to say,\u201d Mr. Waxman said. Ms. Pelosi muscled the bill through the House in 2009 at great cost to some Democrats in conservative areas, only to see the Senate not even touch it, even though it was in Democratic control. That House vote helped sweep Democrats from power the next year.",

      "author": "Emily Cochrane",
      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 At least 18 infants and toddlers younger than 2 years old were separated from their parents for at least 20 days because of the Trump administration\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy at the southwestern border, according to a report released on Friday by a House committee. Those findings were gleaned from records that the House Oversight and Reform Committee obtained under subpoena on at least 2,648 children who were separated from their families, the youngest being just 4 months old. Some of the children were kept apart for as long as six months and 241 of the children were kept in Border Patrol custody longer than 72 hours, some as long as a week. Under federal regulations, migrant children must be transferred to shelters managed by the Department of Health and Human Services after three days in Border Patrol custody. \u201cMy hope is that we can all agree on several basic points,\u201d Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the committee chairman, said on Friday. \u201cAnyone in the custody of our government \u2014 especially a child \u2014 must be treated humanely and with respect.\u201d \u201cThis is our watch,\u201d he added. The report was made public Friday before a heated House oversight hearing on the administration\u2019s family separation policy. Lawmakers heard from a handful of their colleagues, and multiple immigration lawyers and officials, including Thomas D. Homan, the former acting head of Immigration Customs and Enforcement, and Jennifer L. Costello, the acting inspector general for the Department of Homeland Security. The findings set the tone for the hearing: More than 50 children were held in shelters for six months to a year, and more than 20 were held for more than a year. Separated children were held in the shelters for an average of 90 days compared with unaccompanied children who were held for an average of 60 days, according to the report. Republican staff members on the committee argued that much of the data had been taken out of context and that \u201cthis report is political \u2014 not serious oversight.\u201d But witnesses who testified agreed that problems with the separation policy linger. During her opening remarks, Ms. Costello, the acting inspector general, told lawmakers that she remained concerned that officials were \u201cnot taking sufficient steps to address the overcrowding\u201d in detention centers. Elora Mukherjee, the director of Columbia Law School\u2019s Immigrants\u2019 Rights Clinic and a lawyer who visited the detention facility last month in Clint, Tex., described comforting a 6-year-old boy who had been separated from his family. He is \u201ca child, the same age as my son, stuck in a hellhole,\u201d she said, growing emotional. But Mr. Homan, a supporter of the administration\u2019s policies who frequently appears on Fox News, said \u201cBorder Patrol and ICE are merely enforcing the laws enacted by Congress.\u201d \u201cThey are doing the best they can under the circumstances,\u201d he added. Pressed by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York, he acknowledged that at one point he had recommended the zero-tolerance policy. Lawmakers on the committee also heard from a handful of their colleagues who have visited the southwestern border or represent districts in border states. It was a wrenching round of testimony: Representative Rashida Tlaib, Democrat of Michigan, teared up as she described the notes she exchanged with a boy in the Clint detention facility. Representative Chip Roy, Republican of Texas, slammed shut the case of his iPad after railing against the lack of action taken by Congress on immigration. And Ms. Ocasio-Cortez took the unusual step of being sworn in under oath before detailing what she had seen on the border, to counter Republicans who said she was misrepresenting the conditions in Border Patrol facilities. One thing was clear despite lawmakers\u2019 diametrically opposite views of administration policy: They agreed that some legislative action was needed to improve the nation\u2019s immigration system. \u201cHave you ever seen a movie where they have parallel universes?\u201d said Representative Debbie Lesko, Republican of Arizona, who swiped at Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and other Democratic lawmakers for speaking at the hearing, but not representing states along the border. \u201cThat\u2019s what I feel like we\u2019re in, quite honestly.\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez noted that \u201cit feels like we\u2019re speaking in two different worlds.\u201d Like her colleagues, Ms. Tlaib and Representative Ayanna S. Pressley, Democrat of Massachusetts, she argued that sharing the stories of the migrants in detention centers would counter the administration\u2019s perspective. Representative Veronica Escobar of Texas, the one Democrat representing the border, said her city of El Paso was a \u201cmodern day Ellis Island,\u201d where the community responded compassionately to the influx of migrants. \u201cIt\u2019s urgent for us,\u201d Mr. Cummings said as the hearing continued late Friday afternoon, when members traditionally would have already left for their districts. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for solutions, and sometimes to get to solutions, you have to have accountability, you have to have pressure. We want to see something get done.\u201d",

      "author": "Katharine Q. Seelye",
      "content": " BOSTON \u2014 In one of the last major Democratic congressional rivalries to play out before the November elections, the incumbent Michael Capuano and his challenger, Ayanna Pressley, clashed in a heated debate on Tuesday over their qualifications to represent this highly diverse, largely urban district. Ms. Pressley had the strategic imperative to deliver a strong performance before the Sept. 4 primary. Her supporters have hoped she could duplicate the triumph of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a progressive newcomer who defeated another long-term party incumbent in a New York congressional primary. But despite an influx of interest and money after Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s victory in June, recent polling by WBUR, a Boston public radio station, shows Ms. Pressley lagging behind Mr. Capuano by 13 points, the same amount she trailed him by in February. During the debate, the two candidates agreed that they would likely vote the same way on most issues. As a result, Mr. Capuano, 66, who was first elected to Congress in 1998, stressed his experience and effectiveness, while Ms. Pressley, 44, the first woman of color to be elected to the Boston City Council, emphasized her vision for activist leadership. \u201cThis is a dark blue district, a seat that was held by J.F.K.,\u201d Ms. Pressley said. \u201cIt will never be represented by a Republican. You know what that means? That we can be bold, that we can be unrestrained, that we can be innovative, that we can be unencumbered.\u201d The Seventh District includes most of Boston, Cambridge, Somerville and other surrounding towns. Once represented by the former House speaker Thomas P. O\u2019Neill Jr., it has been reconfigured over time and is now the only congressional district in Massachusetts where a majority of residents are not white. It also has a vast disparity in income levels. Mr. Capuano said during the debate, held before a packed audience at the University of Massachusetts Boston, that he has delivered for the district, expanding public transportation, overhauling health care centers and establishing better housing. \u201cIt does take a while to learn how to get things done in Congress,\u201d he said, especially when in the minority. \u201cI\u2019ve been there for a while, and my record speaks for itself.\u201d He said he had earned perfect ratings from the N.A.A.C.P., Planned Parenthood and the A.C.L.U. \u201cThose are not just given out because you happen to just show up and push the right button,\u201d he said. In contrast, Ms. Pressley sought to cast Mr. Capuano as part of an ineffective Democratic Party. \u201cI\u2019d never give short shrift to years of service,\u201d she said. \u201cBut Democrats were in the majority, and we had seniority, and how did we leverage it? What did we do with it to specifically address these disparate outcomes in the Seventh Congressional District?\u201d Leadership, she said, \u201ccan\u2019t just be defined by number of years served or how you vote. It\u2019s about impact in this district.\u201d Asked if race was a factor in her candidacy, Ms. Pressley responded: \u201cRace is a factor in everything.\u201d While race was not the impetus for her run, she said, it matters because \u201cit informs the issues that are spotlighted.\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t have a government by and for the people if it\u2019s not represented by all of the people,\u201d she said. At another juncture, Mr. Capuano said that he \u201cdidn\u2019t have a problem\u201d with having a primary challenger, but that the important thing was his experience as an advocate. He acknowledged that he and Ms. Pressley would probably vote the same way, although he allowed for some differences. \u201cI\u2019m not the only one who votes the way I do, even though I do have a pretty unique voting record,\u201d he said, citing his opposition to the Patriot Act and his support for net neutrality. But, he said, what is important is what comes after a vote. \u201cDo you just vote for a transportation bill and sit back?\u201d he asked. \u201cOr do you jump in and try to take money back to this district to improve the lives of people you represent?\u201d Tuesday\u2019s encounter was the second between the two candidates. The first took place on Sunday; a third is scheduled for Aug. 15.",

      "content": " DETROIT \u2014 Thousands of environmental activists, calling for the Democratic Party to embrace far-reaching plans to curb climate change and address social injustice, gathered for a hard-to-miss rally in Detroit on Tuesday afternoon, hours before the first of two presidential primary debates here. The rally was organized by a coalition of progressive groups called Frontline Detroit, and included the Sunrise Movement, the climate advocacy group seeking to harness the political power of young people to push for the Green New Deal. That proposal, which sets out a broad vision for significantly reducing planet-warming pollution by 2030 while also guaranteeing millions of new jobs, has become a litmus test in the Democratic primary race. Sunrise activists joined with several local liberal groups, chanting and singing as they marched from a central downtown park to the Fox Theater, the site of the debates. [Follow our coverage of Tuesday\u2019s Democratic presidential debate.] The rally\u2019s organizers said their goal was to see more top-tier Democratic candidates put climate change at the forefront of their policy agendas. They also wanted to pressure the candidates to visit some of Detroit\u2019s most marginalized communities, many of which have seen devastating effects from water contamination and air pollution. \u201cThese candidates see the glitz and glamour of America, but they need to see us \u2014 the people on the bottom,\u201d said Theresa Landrum, a local climate organizer. \u201cWhite people champion climate change but it\u2019s us, the people, who are suffering the impact.\u201d The demonstration was part of a monthslong effort by the Sunrise Movement and its allied organizations to pressure Democrats to more forcefully address climate change. That effort began soon after Democrats recaptured the House in last year\u2019s midterm elections. The group orchestrated a sit-in at the office of Nancy Pelosi, who was set to become speaker, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who had just won a House seat in New York, joined in. This year, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez was the primary House sponsor of a nonbinding resolution that laid out the Green New Deal, an ambitious and broad platform that sets targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and calls for the government to guarantee high-paying jobs in clean energy industries. [Kamala Harris and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez unveiled legislation to ensure climate plans benefit low-income communities.] The Sunrise Movement then hosted events across the country this summer aimed at drumming up public support for the proposal. Some political winds have shifted in the activists\u2019 favor. In a Democratic primary with two dozen candidates fighting for attention, groups like Sunrise have been able to seize on the chaos and push their preferred issues into the conversation. Among other things, Sunrise has helped pressure almost all of the candidates to sign a pledge to refuse to accept large donations from fossil-fuel interests. The group has also demanded that the party hold a debate focused on climate change, echoing a call from Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington, who has made global warming the central issue of his presidential campaign. The Democratic National Committee has refused that request, but last week both MSNBC and CNN announced they would broadcast candidate forums about climate change. The announcements reflected the urgency with which Democrats have mobilized around an issue that was hardly mentioned in the 2016 election. Mary Kay Henry, president of the Service Employees International Union, one of the nation\u2019s largest labor unions, said the Green New Deal was gaining political momentum. The union backed the proposal earlier this year, becoming the first major labor group to do so. \u201cMoms and dads in Flint deserve clean water once and for all,\u201d Ms. Henry said, referring to the yearslong lead contamination crisis in the city, about an hour\u2019s drive northwest of Detroit. \u201cSo we\u2019re going to stay in the streets.\u201d Several challenges remain for groups like the Sunrise Movement. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. continues to lead in the polls, representing the strength of moderates in the party who are less likely to support the progressive ideas of the Green New Deal, like employment guarantees. And just as some more moderate candidates have adopted the phrase \u201cMedicare for all\u201d to refer to their health care plans, drawing the ire of progressives who demand a single-payer system, some Sunrise activists fear the candidates may back the Green New Deal in name, but not in detail. \u201cIf you want our vote, you can no longer neglect us,\u201d said S. Baxter Jones, a Detroit activist. \u201cNothing about us, without us.\u201d Few of the top-tier presidential candidates have so far agreed to tour Detroit\u2019s most polluted communities, as Sunrise demanded. But Ms. Landrum said that Mr. Inslee; former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke; Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former housing secretary; and the self-help author Marianne Williamson had scheduled visits.",

Kennedy\u2019s decision to retire from the Supreme Court to upsets in midterm primaries, it was a busy week in American politics. Here are some of the highlights from the headlines this week.By Emily CochranePRINT EDITIONJune 30, 2018",
      "author": "Emily Cochrane",
      "content": " Justice Anthony M. Kennedy announced Wednesday that he would retire from the Supreme Court at the end of July, giving President Trump the opportunity to cement the conservative tone of the United States\u2019 highest court. Over his 30-year tenure, Justice Kennedy was often a crucial deciding vote in some of the court\u2019s most divisive decisions on gay rights, abortion rights and campaign finance. His departure raised concerns for Democrats and liberal activists that those verdicts could be overturned. A political fight began to brew in Washington between conservatives determined to confirm a nominee quickly and activists vowing to fight to preserve the court\u2019s liberal precedents. Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, promised a Senate vote on a nominee by the fall. With only one Republican vote needed to derail a nomination, Democrats are hoping they might sway Senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska or Susan Collins of Maine, who are among the most moderate Republicans in the Senate. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a 28-year-old political newcomer, defeated Representative Joseph Crowley, the fourth-ranking House Democrat, in a New York primary on Tuesday. Mr. Crowley\u2019s defeat reverberated through the Democratic caucus in Congress, as lawmakers grappled with the loss of a likely candidate for speaker and the prospect of new leadership for the party. In other midterm primaries held Tuesday, it was apparent that liberal activists had defeated the establishment while Republican voters stuck with candidates endorsed by Mr. Trump \u2014 a break from the pattern of the past few years. The Supreme Court upheld Mr. Trump\u2019s ban on travel from several predominantly Muslim countries, ruling on Tuesday that the president\u2019s power to secure the country\u2019s borders was not undermined by his inflammatory messaging about the dangers Muslims pose to the United States. The court\u2019s conservatives formed the majority in the 5-to-4 ruling. Justice Sonia Sotomayor delivered a blistering dissent from the bench, condemning the ban as \u201charrowing\u201d and \u201cmotivated by hostility and animus toward the Muslim faith.\u201d The court, again voting 5 to 4 with the more conservative judges in the majority, dealt a sharp blow to labor unions on Wednesday by ruling that government workers who do not join labor unions may not be required to help pay for collective bargaining. A federal judge in California temporarily stopped the Trump administration from separating children from their families at the border by issuing a nationwide injunction Tuesday night. He also ordered that the administration reunite all families already separated at the border. Trump administration officials said on Wednesday that it would be difficult to adhere to the timetable established by the judge, arguing that before releasing children to parents or other relatives, the government must \u201cvet them.\u201d Border officials said earlier in the week that they had temporarily stopped handing over migrant adults who cross the Mexican border into the United States with children for prosecution. The House also overwhelmingly rejected a far-reaching immigration overhaul on Wednesday, despite Mr. Trump\u2019s late endorsement for the legislation\u2019s passage. Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, publicly faced off on Thursday with House Republicans in an ugly televised fight as lawmakers accused him and Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, of hiding information from Congress to protect their own interests. The House also voted to give the Justice Department seven days to produce sensitive documents related to the Russia inquiry and to the F.B.I.\u2019s investigation of Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server. Some Republicans accused Mr. Rosenstein of misconduct related to the investigation into Russian election interference. The two leaders, both appointed by Mr. Trump, defended the special counsel investigation and their response to congressional investigators.\n\nIn the days after the firing of James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director, Mr. Rosenstein repeatedly expressed anger over the White House\u2019s treatment of him and has said the experience damaged his reputation.",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 In the 116th Congress, if you\u2019re a Democrat, you\u2019re either a socialist, a baby killer or an anti-Semite. That, at least, is what Republicans want voters to think, as they seek to demonize Democrats well in advance of the 2020 elections by painting them as left-wing crazies who will destroy the American economy, murder newborn babies and turn a blind eye to bigotry against Jews. The unusually aggressive assault, which Republican officials and strategists outlined in interviews last week, is meant to strangle the new Democratic majority in its infancy. It was set in motion this month by President Trump, who used his State of the Union address to rail against \u201cnew calls to adopt socialism in our country\u201d and mischaracterize legislation backed by Democrats in New York and Virginia as allowing \u201ca baby to be ripped from the mother\u2019s womb moments before birth.\u201d Then last week, Republicans amped it up, seizing on a Twitter post by a freshman representative, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, which even some Democrats condemned as anti-Semitic, and ridiculing the \u201cGreen New Deal,\u201d an ambitious economic stimulus plan unveiled by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a self-described democratic socialist. Suddenly even Jewish Democrats were abetting anti-Semitism and moderate Democrats in Republican districts were Trotskyites and Stalinists. \u201cSocialism is the greatest vulnerability by far that the House Democrats have,\u201d Representative Tom Emmer of Minnesota, the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, said in an interview, adding that he had also instructed his team to spotlight \u201call the extreme wild ideas\u201d that Democrats espouse, \u201con a daily basis, on an hourly basis if it\u2019s available.\u201d House Republicans have identified 55 Democrats they regard as vulnerable, including many freshmen. Some flipped Republican seats last year, some represent districts carried by Mr. Trump in 2016, and some are in districts held by Republicans until recently. Bruised by their losses last year, Republicans are determined to start earlier and be more aggressive on the offense in 2020, and are hoping to exploit the Democratic presidential candidates\u2019 courtship of the left. An advertising offensive is already underway. The Congressional Leadership Fund, a political action committee affiliated with House Republican leaders, began running digital ads last week that link two freshmen who flipped Republican districts, Representatives Colin Allred of Texas and Antonio Delgado of New York, to Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and her \u201cradical Green New Deal assault on the American economy.\u201d The spots are the first in what will be a national campaign, according to Zach Hunter, a spokesman for the fund. The stark ads, featuring stern-looking images of Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, offer a preview of how Republicans intend to vilify her in much the same way they have vilified Speaker Nancy Pelosi, caricaturing her as a radical from San Francisco. Democrats see an insidious effort to use women and minorities, especially women of color, as the new symbols of the radical \u201cother.\u201d And they are calling out Republicans as hypocrites, noting that Mr. Trump and other Republicans trafficked in anti-Semitic tropes and racist dog whistles long before anyone noticed Ms. Omar\u2019s Twitter feed. \u201cI guess they used that argument to its end, and so they have to find someone new,\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said in a brief interview. \u201cAnd who else to use except folks like myself and other freshmen congresswomen? We\u2019re least like them in every way possible, so I think it\u2019s a potent symbol.\u201d But Republicans like Mr. Emmer say they are simply repeating Democrats\u2019 own words, and they have been aided by Democratic stumbles. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s team published an early draft of the Green New Deal \u2014 which has been backed by several top-tier Democratic presidential candidates \u2014 that contained phrases those candidates did not endorse, including a call for economic security for \u201call who are unable or unwilling to work.\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez deleted the draft from her website, but Republicans took it and ran. Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the chairwoman of the House Republican Conference, called the plan \u2014 endorsed by 70 Democrats in the House and about a dozen in the Senate \u2014 \u201ca fantasy\u201d and insisted the erroneous draft be placed in the Congressional Record. Sean Hannity, the Fox News commentator, called it \u201ca form of insanity.\u201d The Republican National Committee issued a briefing paper headlined \u201cThe Democrats\u2019 Burgeoning Love Affair With Socialism.\u201d In the Senate, where five Democrats are already running for president, Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, announced he would force a vote on the measure, drawing howls from Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, who slammed the move as a \u201ccynical stunt\u201d intended solely to put Democrats, including the presidential candidates, on the spot. A vote in favor of the Green New Deal could help them court progressives in the primary vote, but hurt in a general election. \u201cDemocrats have handed Republicans this messaging on a silver platter,\u201d said Andy Surabian, a Republican strategist and former Trump White House official, adding that he believed socialism and Democrats\u2019 stance on abortion were more powerful lines of attack than anti-Semitism. \u201cAll these controversies dovetail perfectly with the president\u2019s messaging at the State of the Union.\u201d Democrats dismissed the messaging as par for the course. \u201cWe are not going to abandon socialist policies like Social Security \u2014 or is that \u2018socialist security,\u2019 is that what they call it?\u201d Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate, said wryly. \u201cThe bottom line is the president is in campaign mode \u2014 maybe he\u2019s always in campaign mode \u2014 and I just expect a lot of this to be thrown over the transom.\u201d Democrats say they intend to counter the offensive by talking about the issues they ran and won on: reducing health care costs and prescription drug prices, passing an infrastructure package and rooting out corruption in Washington. \u201cWe have an agenda to help families, and we have ideas,\u201d said Representative Cheri Bustos of Illinois, the chairwoman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, who is among those being targeted. \u201cWashington Republicans are set back now, and all they\u2019re playing on is exaggerations and fear.\u201d But Democrats must be careful not to let those exaggerations take hold. They are well aware that their path to keeping the majority runs through districts like Ms. Bustos\u2019s, which the president carried in 2016. \u201cOf course I can see them trying to drive a wedge between the people in our districts, the people who are in more moderate districts,\u201d said Representative Josh Gottheimer, a centrist Democrat from New Jersey and a chairman of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s really important that we make sure that we govern from the middle.\u201d The hardball tactics have been especially evident in the Republican response to Ms. Omar\u2019s tweet last week, and to the legislation adopted in New York, and proposed in Virginia, to loosen restrictions on abortions in the third trimester of pregnancy under certain conditions. Before he became embroiled in a controversy over blackface, Gov. Ralph Northam of Virginia, a Democrat, gave Republicans an opening last month when he said during a radio interview about the bill that \u201ca discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother\u201d in the case of an infant born with severe deformities. Mr. Northam\u2019s office later said he was discussing medical treatment, not abortion, but Republicans, including Mr. Trump, accused him of promoting infanticide. House Republican leaders began gathering signatures to force a vote on legislation requiring doctors to provide care \u201cwhen a child is born alive following an abortion or attempted abortion.\u201d The National Republican Congressional Committee, meanwhile, began filling reporters\u2019 inboxes with attacks targeted at centrist freshmen, with subject lines like \u201cSo we\u2019re murdering newborns now?\u201d and \u201cAbortion extremists come to New Mexico,\u201d referring to Representative Xochitl Torres Small. The committee has spent weeks lobbing charges of anti-Semitism at Ms. Omar and another freshman Democrat, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, both fierce critics of Israel. But after Democratic leaders forced Ms. Omar to apologize for insinuating on Twitter that American policy toward Israel was fueled by money, the committee expanded its campaign, suggesting that other Democrats \u2014 including Representative Elaine Luria of Virginia, who is Jewish \u2014 were somehow abetting an anti-Semite. Ms. Luria, a freshman and Navy veteran, led the effort to push the Democratic leadership to speak out about Ms. Omar\u2019s tweet. Yet under an email with the subject line \u201cBe a leader, Elaine,\u201d the committee pressed Ms. Luria to demand Ms. Omar\u2019s removal from the House Foreign Affairs Committee \u201cinstead of letting the anti-Semite spew hate without any repercussions.\u201d Ms. Luria and her team were incensed. \u201cCongresswoman Luria served for 20 years in the United States Navy, and, as a Jewish woman in America, she will not be lectured by Washington Republicans about anti-Semitism,\u201d Ms. Luria\u2019s chief of staff, Kathryn Sorenson, said in an email. Mr. Emmer defended the statement, saying the committee was not \u201cgoing after\u201d Ms. Luria but rather \u201ccriticizing her and some others for not calling for their colleagues\u2019 removal from the Foreign Affairs Committee.\u201d He said Democrats could expect more of the same in 2020, adding, \u201cThis is all about compare and contrast.\u201d",

Here\u2019s Why the Polls Missed Some of Them.In several races this year, polls have failed to capture the energy behind a progressive insurgent. We asked four experts why.By Maggie AstorPRINT EDITIONElection Season  Full of Surprises|September 12, 2018, Page A14",
      "author": "Maggie Astor",
      "content": " Ayanna Pressley\u2019s blowout victory over a 10-term congressman last week was the latest example of a trend that has become abundantly clear: 2018 is the year of the progressive insurgent, from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to Andrew Gillum. But if you relied exclusively on polls, you may not have seen these results coming. A survey conducted in late July, more than a month before the election, showed Ms. Pressley losing by 13 percentage points; she ended up winning by 17. The last poll conducted by Representative Joseph Crowley showed him beating Ms. Ocasio-Cortez by 36 percentage points, but she ended up beating him by 15 in June. We asked four experts what could have made the polls seem so wrong. Some of it, they said, had to do with capturing the grass-roots energy of 2018. But much of the trouble is more mundane: Primaries are just really hard to predict. For all the talk of converting swing voters, a vast majority of Americans who are registered with a political party will vote for that party\u2019s candidate. This provides a sort of backbone for polling in general elections. In primaries, that backbone is missing, making polling much more difficult. \u201cThe things that drive the vote in November are not the same things that drive the vote in the summer, or whenever the primary is being held,\u201d said Charles Franklin, director of the Marquette Law School Poll. \u201cYou don\u2019t have the strong structuring of partisanship within a primary that you do in a November election.\u201d Without the constraints of partisanship, voters\u2019 allegiance is more fluid. They may start out supporting the incumbent but be persuaded to change their minds when they learn more about a challenger. This means that huge shifts in opinion can happen very quickly, in a way you are very unlikely to see in general elections. Take the poll that showed Ms. Pressley\u2019s opponent, Representative Michael Capuano, leading by 13 points. It was conducted more than a month before the election, and \u201cat the time, that was probably an accurate depiction,\u201d said Patrick Ruffini, a Republican pollster and co-founder of Echelon Insights. \u201cBut things change very quickly in primary electorates, where voters are unmoored from party preferences. I\u2019ve seen numbers move 20 points or more in a week.\u201d [Read more about how The Times is polling the midterms] Unlike in presidential races, voters tend not to pay much attention to congressional primaries until the last weeks or even days before they vote, so early polling may be way off base. And if one of the candidates is running a grass-roots campaign, in which personal engagement is decisive, accurate early polling becomes even harder. \u201cThe engagement comes late, the paid communication comes late, so what happens in the last two or three weeks matters a lot,\u201d said Anna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster at Greenberg Quinlan Rosner. \u201cIf there\u2019s a heavily grass-roots campaign, the impact of that is going to be felt really close to Election Day and on Election Day.\u201d In a race like Ms. Pressley\u2019s or Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s, \u201cthe whole point is their candidacies are mobilizing Americans who are not participating in these kinds of elections,\u201d said Mark Blumenthal, head of election polling at SurveyMonkey. \u201cThey may not themselves know that they\u2019re likely to vote until a few days, maybe a week before the election.\u201d Turnout in nonpresidential primaries is low, often less than 20 percent. So if you want accurate numbers, you can\u2019t just take a random sample of all registered voters \u2014 you have to make some educated guesses about who is likely to vote and who isn\u2019t. That creates lots of room for error, and even more so when the district in question has not had a competitive primary in many years, as was the case in Ms. Pressley\u2019s and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s districts, and in many others this year. \u201cWe had a lot of primaries this cycle where there\u2019s not been a competitive primary ever in the current district lines,\u201d Dr. Greenberg said. \u201cSo knowing who\u2019s going to come out is next to impossible.\u201d Careful consumers of polls know to look at the margin of error, but that only reflects how much the composition of the sample is likely to differ from the composition of the full population being surveyed. If you don\u2019t even know what the full population looks like, that\u2019s a whole other source of inaccuracy, Mr. Blumenthal said. And this, too, is more of an issue with grass-roots campaigns. \u201cIn general, you would say primaries are made up of older voters who are more intensely partisan, probably have participated in more elections in the past,\u201d Dr. Franklin said. \u201cBut the whole point of a successful insurgency is to overturn that by turning out young people or boosting Hispanic or African-American turnout, for example. By definition, you don\u2019t know those things for sure until after the election is over.\u201d Many of the upsets this year have been driven by groups of voters who are very difficult for pollsters to reach, in a primary race or a general election. While the most reliable polls include cellphones in their samples, many people simply don\u2019t answer calls from unknown numbers. This means young voters and minorities are often underrepresented in polls, even when they are properly represented in the initial samples. For instance, when The New York Times \u2014 as part of a live polling project for the general election \u2014 polled Kentucky\u2019s Sixth District on Thursday, it had a success rate of 1 in 41 among voters 65 and older. But among voters 18 to 29, the success rate was 1 in 671. \u201cThe progressives are mobilizing voters who in particular may be more difficult for pollsters to get hold of,\u201d Mr. Blumenthal said.",

      "author": "Linda Qiu",
      "content": " Representative-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the New York Democrat who has become a darling of the progressive left, was quoting from an article in The Nation about \u201cmassive accounting fraud\u201d committed by the Pentagon from 1998 to 2015. But her suggestion that the $21 trillion in military transactions could have \u201calready\u201d paid two-thirds the cost of a \u201cMedicare for all\u201d health care system goes beyond what the article reported \u2014 and is misleading. For starters, the combined Pentagon budget from 1998 to 2015 was $9.2 trillion. One study by a libertarian economic think tank found that \u201cMedicare for all\u201d legislation by Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, would cost the federal government $32.6 trillion over 10 years. So where did the $21 trillion figure originate? It comes from an analysis of the Pentagon\u2019s \u201cunsupported journal voucher adjustments,\u201d by Mark Skidmore, an economist at Michigan State University. The term refers to improperly documented accounting adjustments that are made when different financial ledgers do not match. In other words, $21 trillion is the total value of adjustments made to the Pentagon\u2019s financial records over those years that could not be traced. That is not the same thing as $21 trillion in spending. David Norquist, the Pentagon\u2019s comptroller, explained in testimony to Congress in January that the adjustments occur after money is spent because \u201cwe have systems that do not automatically pass data from one to the other.\u201d For example, Mr. Norquist said, the Army\u2019s general ledger may initially estimate the cost of property and equipment. That estimate is later updated with a more specific cost, based on the actual value of property. In the 2015 fiscal year, the Army general fund reported making about $1 trillion worth of adjustments to its assets, according to the Defense Department\u2019s inspector general. It also made about $1 trillion in adjustment to its liabilities. Together, that accounted for $2 trillion in adjustments \u2014 even though the actual dollar amounts potentially offset each other. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want the taxpayer to confuse that with not \u2014 with the loss of something like a trillion dollars. It\u2019s not. That wouldn\u2019t be accurate,\u201d Mr. Norquist said. \u201cBut it\u2019s an accounting problem that does need to be solved, because it can help hide other underlying issues.\u201d In an interview, Professor Skidmore faulted the Pentagon for its lack of transparency and expressed skepticism that mismatches in property evaluations could account for all $21 trillion. He noted that large state governments like New York and California will make similar adjustments, but equivalent to small percentages of their budgets \u2014 not magnitudes larger. The Pentagon\u2019s adjustments could well be \u201caccounting gimmicks to reconcile accounts, fine \u2014 or something else, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Professor Skidmore said. \u201cI\u2019m just absolutely perplexed. Why not have the underlying information?\u201d The same article from The Nation that Ms. Ocasio-Cortez quoted also noted that Professor Skidmore\u2019s analysis \u201cdoes not contend that all of this $21 trillion was secret or misused funding\u201d and that the transfers \u201care found on both the positive and the negative sides of the ledger, thus potentially netting each other out.\u201d Todd Harrison, the director of defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the $21 trillion figure \u201cdouble and triple counts funding that is transferred internally.\u201d \u201cAnd just because a transaction cannot be fully traced and documented does not mean it was fraudulent or wasted,\u201d Mr. Harrison said. Instead, it means the Defense Department \u201chas not been able to pass an audit,\u201d he said. The Pentagon did indeed fail an audit in November.",

      "content": " \u201cWomen like me aren\u2019t supposed to run for office,\u201d Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez declared in the opening of her campaign video that went viral this spring. And women like her weren\u2019t supposed to win primary challenges against incumbents, particularly powerful ones like Representative Joseph Crowley, who had been mentioned as a potential House speaker. But she did. So is this the year that women break the rules \u2014 and win? This year\u2019s midterm elections have produced a surge of women like her across the country: progressive candidates running outsider campaigns powered by strong personal narratives and women\u2019s activism that began with massive marches the day after President Trump\u2019s inauguration and has grown through protests against gun violence, the stripping away of the Affordable Care Act and immigration policies that divide families. But Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s win in New York\u2019s 14th Congressional District Tuesday may be more one-off than wave. The same night she won by 15 points, another woman of color, Saira Rao, lost her energetic bid from the left in a primary against Rep. Diana DeGette in Colorado. Three weeks earlier, so did another, Tanzie Youngblood, in an open primary against a conservative Democrat in New Jersey. Whether other women become overnight stars like Ms. Ocasio-Cortez \u2014 or Stacey Abrams, whose win in the Democratic primary for governor in Georgia sparked similar excitement \u2014 depends on the dynamics of each state or district. \u201cYes, we are in this year where the rules seem to have gone out the door, but I\u2019m still quite cautious,\u201d said Wendy Smooth, a professor of  gender and political science at Ohio State University. \u201cWe can say that there are some unique stories that could resonate but whether or not they win, it\u2019s \u2018politics is local.\u2019\u201d The conditions in New York were near perfect. The district had been redrawn so that its voters look more like Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, whose mother is Puerto Rican, than Mr. Crowley, who is white. The state divided its primary \u2014 moving the more high-profile contest for governor to September \u2014 allowing a strong turnout by activist groups to make a huge difference. Mr. Crowley, a 10-term congressman, didn\u2019t take the race seriously, sending a surrogate to stand in his place at a debate. And Ms. Ocasio-Cortez made a compelling pitch. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s win immediately raised comparisons with and hopes for Ayanna Pressley, running in a Democratic primary against another 10-term congressman, Michael Capuano, of Massachusetts. (Ms. Ocasio-Cortez shouted out to Ms. Pressley in her victory speech.) Massachusetts is a machine state and Mr. Capuano has strong labor support \u2014 but then, people said the same in New York. One district over from that race is Brianna Wu, challenging Rep. Stephen Lynch from the left. And before the Massachusetts primaries in September, there is Lucy McBath, who became an anti-gun activist after her son\u2019s murder, in a July 24 runoff to be the Democratic nominee in Georgia\u2019s Sixth District. Other women to watch include Rashida Tlaib, bidding to be the first Muslim woman elected to Congress in Michigan\u2019s 13th District, an opening created by the resignation of another longtime Democrat power broker, John Conyers Jr., in a sexual harassment scandal. Ilhan Omar, a Somali-American state legislator, is running in the Democratic primary on August 14 for Minnesota\u2019s Fifth District, an open seat that, like the ones Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and Ms. Tlaib are seeking to fill, is solidly Democratic. She has attracted progressive activism locally and national support from immigrant-rights groups newly mobilized against President Trump\u2019s travel ban, which blocks most travelers from Somalia. The bigger questions are about Democratic women running in places that are historically Republican \u2014 and that\u2019s most Democratic women running this year. Stacey Abrams has created excitement around the possibility of electing the nation\u2019s first black female governor \u2014 in Georgia, no less. But yes, Georgia, where white voters have been stingy about supporting black candidates and voters have dashed the hopes of a string of promising Democrats for governor. New Jersey\u2019s 11th District has been solidly Republican for the last 20 years. But Donald Trump won it by only a small margin in 2016, and Mikie Sherrill, the Democratic nominee, has amassed an impressive campaign war chest. A Monmouth University poll this week shows Democrats more excited than Republicans about the race, suggesting that Ms. Sherrill could win on the strength of newly energized resistance groups. (That energy helped push the incumbent, Rodney Frelinghuysen, into retirement.) Elsewhere the path to victory is steeper, because the races are against incumbents, who historically almost always win. Kara Eastman, who won an outsider campaign against a former congressman in the Democratic primary in Nebraska\u2019s second district, is now running against a Republican incumbent protected by gerrymandering. Closer to Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, Liuba Grechen Shirley beat the Democratic Party establishment candidate by 16 points in the primary Tuesday for a seat on Long Island. But now she faces Representative Peter King, who has been in office for 25 years and routinely wins by double digits. Still, Ms. Grechen Shirley notes that Democrats have a slight edge in voter registration, and possibly in energy. \u201cI had a press conference outside of King\u2019s office and a man came up to me and said, \u2018My wife voted for you. I am a Republican, so I couldn\u2019t vote in the primary but I am going to vote for you in November and I\u2019d like to give you a donation.\u2019\u201d \u201cPeople have had enough,\u201d Ms. Grechen Shirley said. Rebecca Katz, a senior strategist to Cynthia Nixon, who is hoping the Ocasio-Cortez victory foretells victory in her from-the-left challenge to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo in the September primary, predicted a wave big enough to beat many other presumably safe incumbents. \u201cI think there is something new about women challengers that is different this year,\u201d Ms. Katz said.  \u201cThere is a hunger for a different type of perspective. The cycle started being about women\u2019s health, then it was gun safety, then keeping families together. All along it\u2019s been moms and women driving it.\u201d Debbie Walsh, the director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers, has been tempering hopes for a \u201cpink wave\u201d this year because so many women are running uphill. But she also points out that in last year\u2019s elections for the Virginia House of Delegates, 30 women ran as challengers, and 30 percent of them won. Just three of the 24 male challengers, around 12 percent, did. \u201cThere\u2019s something percolating,\u201d she said.",

Democrats Are Bracing.After victories by progressive candidates in New York, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Maryland, young liberals are trying to remake the party into a ferocious opposition force.By Alexander BurnsPRINT EDITIONDemocrats Brace As Storm Brews Far to Their Left|July 22, 2018, Page A1",
      "author": "Alexander Burns",
      "content": " DETROIT \u2014 For Rachel Conner, the 2018 election season has been a moment of revelation. A 27-year-old social worker, Ms. Conner voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 primaries, spurning the more liberal Bernie Sanders, whom many of her peers backed. But Ms. Conner changed course in this year\u2019s campaign for governor, after concluding that Democrats could only win with more daring messages on issues like public health and immigration. And so on a recent Wednesday, she enlisted two other young women to volunteer for Abdul El-Sayed, a 33-year-old advocate of single-payer health care running an uphill race in Michigan to become the country\u2019s first Muslim governor. \u201cThey need to wake up and pay attention to what people actually want,\u201d Ms. Conner said of Democratic leaders. \u201cThere are so many progressive policies that have widespread support that mainstream Democrats are not picking up on, or putting that stuff down and saying, \u2018That wouldn\u2019t really work.\u2019\u201d Voters like Ms. Conner may not represent a controlling faction in the Democratic Party, at least not yet. But they are increasingly rattling primary elections around the country, and they promise to grow as a disruptive force in national elections as younger voters reject the traditional boundary lines of Democratic politics. Energized to take on President Trump, these voters are also seeking to remake their own party as a ferocious \u2014 and ferociously liberal \u2014 opposition force. And many appear as focused on forcing progressive policies into the midterm debate as they are on defeating Republicans. The impact of these activists in the 2018 election has been limited but revealing: Only about a sixth of Democratic congressional nominees so far have a formal affiliation with one of several important insurgent groups. Fifty-three of the 305 candidates have been endorsed by the Justice Democrats, the Working Families Party, the Progressive Change Campaign and Our Revolution, organizations that have helped propel challenges to Democratic incumbents. But the voters who make up the ascending coalition on the left have had an outsize effect on the national political conversation, driving the Democrats\u2019 internal policy debates and putting pressure on party leaders unseen in previous campaigns. Mark Brewer, a former longtime chairman of the Michigan Democratic Party, said \u201cprogressive energy\u201d was rippling across the state. But Mr. Brewer, who backs Gretchen Whitmer, a former State Senate leader and the Democratic front-runner for governor, said Michigan Democrats were an ideologically diverse bunch and the party could not expect to win simply by running far to the left. \u201cThere are a lot of moderate and even conservative Democrats in Michigan,\u201d Mr. Brewer cautioned. \u201cIt\u2019s always been a challenge for Democrats to hold that coalition together in the general election.\u201d Progressive activists have already upended one major election in Michigan, derailing a former federal prosecutor, Pat Miles, who was running for attorney general with the support of organized labor, by endorsing another lawyer, Dana Nessel, who litigated against Michigan\u2019s gay marriage ban, at a party convention. In more solidly Democratic parts of the country, younger progressives have battered entrenched political leaders, ousting veteran state legislators in Pennsylvania and Maryland and rejecting, in upstate New York, a congressional candidate recruited by the national party. In Maryland, Democrats passed over several respected local officials to select Ben Jealous, a former N.A.A.C.P. president and an ally of Mr. Sanders who backs single-payer health care, as their nominee for governor. And in a climactic upset in New York last month, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a 28-year-old Democratic socialist, felled Representative Joseph Crowley, the fourth-ranking Democrat in the House. [Read about Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s debut on the national campaign stage in Kansas.] With about two months left in primary season, a handful of races remain where restive liberals could flout the Democratic establishment, demolishing archaic party machinery or pressuring Democrats in moderate areas to tack left. Beyond Mr. El-Sayed, there are also insurgents contesting primaries for governor in Florida and New York, for Senate in Delaware and for a smattering of House seats in states including Kansas, Massachusetts and Missouri. The pressure from a new generation of confrontational progressives has put Democrats at the precipice of a sweeping transition, away from not only the centrist ethos of the Bill Clinton years but also, perhaps, from the consensus-oriented liberalism of Barack Obama. Less than a decade ago, Mr. Obama\u2019s spokesman, Robert Gibbs, derided the \u201cprofessional left\u201d for making what he suggested were preposterous demands \u2014 like pressing for \u201cCanadian health care.\u201d That attitude now appears obsolete, on matters well beyond health policy. Corey Johnson, the progressive speaker of the New York City Council, who supported Mr. Crowley over Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, urged Democrats to recognize the intensity of \u201canger, fear and disappointment from people in our own party,\u201d especially those new to the political process. \u201cThey\u2019re young, and a lot of them are folks that weren\u2019t around or weren\u2019t engaged when Obama ran for the first time,\u201d Mr. Johnson, 36, said. \u201cSo this is their moment of: Let\u2019s take our country back.\u201d In a source of relief to Democratic officials, the millennial-infused left has left a lighter mark in moderate areas where Republicans are defending their congressional majorities, and where bluntly left-wing candidates could struggle to win. In House races, Democrats have mainly picked nominees well to the left of center, but to the right of Mr. Sanders and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez. Across most of the approximately 60 Republican-held districts that Democrats are contesting, primary voters have chosen candidates who seem to embody change \u2014 many of them women and minorities \u2014 but who have not necessarily endorsed positions like single-payer health care and abolishing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency. Some national Democrats remain skeptical that voters are focused on specific policy demands of the kind Mr. El-Sayed and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez have championed. Former Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley of Maryland, a left-of-center Democrat who ran for president in 2016, suggested the party wants \u201cnew leaders and fresh ideas\u201d more than hard-left ideology. \u201cSometimes that may be filled by a leader who calls herself a Democratic socialist, and sometimes it\u2019s not,\u201d said Mr. O\u2019Malley, reflecting on the political convulsion that touched his home state. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s with a young person. Sometimes it\u2019s with a retiree. Sometimes it\u2019s with a vet.\u201d Several crucial Democratic victories since 2016 have also come with avowedly moderate standard-bearers, such as Senator Doug Jones of Alabama and Representative Conor Lamb of Pennsylvania, who won grueling special elections. And unlike hard-liners on the right, Democratic activists have not contested Senate primaries in conservative-leaning states where the majority is at stake, allowing centrists to run unimpeded in Arizona and Tennessee. Yet among Democratic stalwarts, there is a sometimes-rueful recognition that a cultural gulf separates them from the party\u2019s next generation, much of which inhabits a world of freewheeling social media and countercultural podcasts that are wholly unfamiliar to older Democrats. Evan Nowlin, a writer and barista supporting Mr. El-Sayed, said he had been motivated to volunteer by a podcast hosted by The Intercept, a left-leaning news site that has intensively covered challenges to the Democratic establishment. Mr. Nowlin, a soft-spoken 26-year-old who supported Mr. Sanders in 2016, said the traditional Democratic leadership had plainly failed to inspire the country. \u201cI think they\u2019re generally spineless,\u201d he said. In some instances, the party\u2019s rebels may be too brazen even for some of the candidates they have supported. The gradations of Democratic revolution were on display at an event in Brooklyn Tuesday celebrating the Working Families Party: Cynthia Nixon, the actor running in a September primary against Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York, a more moderate Democrat, drew cheers hailing Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and her fellow Democratic socialists. But Mr. Jealous, the Maryland nominee for governor, who is supported by Working Families and addressed the event, was warier of the socialist label. After embracing Ms. Nixon on stage but not quite endorsing her, Mr. Jealous chuckled at a question about the resurrection of Democratic socialism as a political identity. \u201cI\u2019m a venture capitalist,\u201d he said, noting his work as an investor. \u201cI\u2019m kind of like the last person to ask.\u201d In Michigan, however, Mr. El-Sayed is counting on a mood of ideological ambition to decide his primary: He remains an underdog, facing a well-funded rival in Ms. Whitmer, who is backed by powerful labor unions like the United Auto Workers. She has led in recent polls, while a third candidate, Shri Thanedar, a wealthy wild card, has complicated the race. Aiming to build momentum, Mr. El-Sayed will campaign later this month with Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, to whom he linked himself in generation and political outlook. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez also campaigned in Kansas Friday for liberal House candidates and was slated for an event over the weekend for a primary challenger to a Democratic incumbent in Missouri, William Lacy Clay. \u201cThe rise of somebody like Alexandria seems kind of obvious to somebody in our generation,\u201d Mr. El-Sayed said in an interview, casting the moment in grand terms: \u201cThe machine, whether it is on the right or on the left, has assented to this broken system of corporate politics, and I think people are real frustrated about that.\u201d That mind-set unnerves Democratic veterans like Mr. Brewer, the former party chairman, in a state where they have long struggled to overcome a Republican machine aligned with the business community. Mr. Trump\u2019s slim victory there exposed divisions between the national Democratic Party and many of the white union members on whose votes Michigan Democrats rely, underscoring Democrats\u2019 tenuous position in 2018. But within deep-blue precincts where Democratic insurgency appears strongest, talk of accommodating the center is in short supply. In Massachusetts, where several incumbent House Democrats are facing feisty challenges, Michelle Wu, a 33-year-old member of the Boston City Council, said voters are demanding leaders who share their intense alarm about economic and racial inequality. Defying the local machine, she recently endorsed Ayanna Pressley, a fellow council member, in a primary against Representative Michael Capuano, a long-serving liberal. \u201cPeople want to believe we can take our own future into our hands,\u201d Ms. Wu said.",

      "content": "  CHELSEA, Mass. \u2014 It was the day after a Latina community activist in New York toppled an entrenched congressman of her own party in one of the biggest political upsets of the decade. And the shock waves reverberated 200 miles away in Boston, where another woman of color who is challenging an entrenched incumbent was clearly buoyed by the surprising turn of events. Ayanna Pressley, a Boston city councilwoman, appearing at a candidate forum at a senior center Wednesday night, gave a brief, impassioned speech about economic inequality and concluded that she \u2014 \u201cthis woman!\u201d \u2014 could be a disruptive force for change. The audience whooped and hollered in support. In an interview afterward, Ms. Pressley, her voice raspy from pollen in the air, said she was inspired by the stunning success of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Tuesday in a New York Democratic House primary. \u201cWhat her victory has done is reaffirmed for us that there\u2019s a path to victory, that this is winnable and that it\u2019s going to come down to the field,\u201d Ms. Pressley said, referring to how campaign workers get out the vote. Since Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s victory over longtime Queens Democrat Joseph Crowley, several other insurgent candidates have drawn inspiration from the success of her unapologetically progressive campaign \u2014 providing hope that they, too, could upend the Democratic establishment against all odds. This is especially true among women, who are running for Congress in record numbers this year. In Massachusetts, three women who are challenging longtime male House members said the results in New York have provided a jolt of confidence. Every race has its own dynamics, and two of the three women running in Massachusetts remain long shots to win their primaries on Sept. 4. But each also received an uptick in fund-raising and social media interest after Ms. Ocasio-Cortez scored her victory, their campaigns said \u2014 a testament to just how many progressive voters see 2018 as an opportunity to upend the party\u2019s male stalwarts. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s victory instantly raised Ms. Pressley\u2019s national profile in her race against Representative Michael E. Capuano, increasing media attention, visits to her website (pageviews are up 57 percent since Monday, with 43 percent more people signing up to volunteer or donate) and donations to her campaign. She received 205 contributions from Tuesday night through Thursday morning, most of them under $100, for a total of $18,000; that\u2019s three times the number of contributions she received in the same period last week. Brianna Wu, a software engineer running against Representative Stephen Lynch in a district largely comprising communities south of Boston, said her campaign had one of its best fund-raising days in weeks on Wednesday \u2014 all thanks to Ms. Ocasio-Cortez. \u201cSeeing someone in a similar position, and with your positions on the issues, take on the system and win \u2014 it makes your whole team feel unbelievably energized,\u201dMs. Wu said in a telephone interview. She said both she and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez were focused on energizing new voters who are historically less likely to turn out in midterm elections. \u201cWhat really excites me is her energy, that you\u2019re going out and you\u2019re talking to constituents who don\u2019t feel represented,\u201d Ms. Wu said. \u201cIt lights your soul on fire, it makes you want to get out there and knock on twice as many doors.\u201d Tahirah Amatul-Wadud, a lawyer from Springfield, Mass., who is challenging 15-term incumbent Richard Neal in Massachusetts\u2019s 1st district, said Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s victory was particularly inspiring to her as a fellow minority woman. \u201cWe don\u2019t have millions of dollars to buy visibility,\u201d Ms. Amatul-Wadud said. \u201cWe have to go door to door. We have to talk to the grass roots. We have to talk to the masses, not just the elite.\u201d Neither Ms. Amatul-Wadud\u2019s opponent nor Ms. Wu\u2019s responded to requests for comment. Although the insurgent candidates said the intangible benefits of Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s victory were immense, national political analysts warned against drawing too many parallels between her triumph and other races. The overwhelming majority of Democratic incumbents have been successful in defending their seats this election cycle, and while the party frequently has clashes of ideas and strategy, grass-roots activism traditionally has to be coupled with significant monetary investment to be successful, said Anna Sampaio, who specializes in race, gender and politics at Santa Clara University. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say this is a tidal wave,\u201d Ms. Sampaio said. \u201cThe animosity against Trump alone won\u2019t make the difference. You have to invest in registering, connecting and mobilizing voters. And without that investment, that tidal wave? I don\u2019t see it coming.\u201d Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University, said Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s victory required \u201cthe right time, right place, right message and right candidate.\u201d She said this alignment, though inspiring, would be difficult to replicate. \u201cAt most, it\u2019s a wake-up call to Democrats, and it\u2019s a wake-up call for incumbents of either party,\u201d Ms. Walsh said of Tuesday\u2019s results. \u201cNever take a re-election for granted.\u201d But if there is an analogous situation in the Bay State to Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s victory, it may be the campaign of Ms. Pressley, who similarly combines grass-roots support with institutional credibility. Ms. Pressley has been endorsed by Justice Democrats, the progressive organization that was among the first to encourage Ms. Ocasio-Cortez to run. In the interview, Ms. Pressley sought to align herself closely with Ms. Ocasio-Cortez. \u201cNeither of us are accepting corporate PAC money,\u201d Ms. Pressley said. \u201cWe both have taken a position to defund and to abolish ICE. We both support health care and Medicare for all. So there are many similarities \u2014 our convictions, our values, our positions, and the kind of campaigns we\u2019re running and how we hope to govern.\u201d As the primary approaches, Ms. Pressley has mobilized a sizable grass-roots engagement team and hopes to execute the same field strategy that proved so successful for her New York counterpart. \u201cAyanna\u2019s got an opportunity now, she\u2019s got a chance,\u201d said Mary Anne Marsh, a Boston-based Democratic strategist. \u201cThere\u2019s national attention on her because someone like Ocasio-Cortez \u2014 who was outspent, worked like crazy, organized like crazy and has a great message \u2014 won. The question is, can Ayanna make good on this opportunity?\u201d Doug Rubin, another Democratic consultant in Boston, said he believed the environment was so ripe for change that Ms. Pressley had the potential to win. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s victory, he said, would help Ms. Pressley with raising money and her profile \u2014 \u201cand giving more credibility to her victory scenario.\u201d But for all their similarities, Ms. Pressley lacks an advantage that Ms. Ocasio-Cortez had \u2014 she is not catching her opponent off guard. \u201cCapuano was initially in a state of denial, but then he kicked into gear, and he\u2019s putting together a real campaign now,\u201d said Ms. Marsh, the strategist. \u201cHe had a good visit to the border, he\u2019s picking up endorsements left and right, and if he can\u2019t win them, he\u2019s trying to deny them from her.\u201d Mr. Capuano has been endorsed by minority establishment figures such as Representative John Lewis, the civil rights icon, and organizations like the political arm of the Congressional Black Caucus. He also has the crucial backing of Boston\u2019s mayor, Martin J. Walsh. Mr. Capuano was not available for comment Thursday, but his spokeswoman said in a statement: \u201cBecause of Donald Trump, we\u2019re in the fight of our lives, and we believe people here will recognize that we need to keep Mike\u2019s experience, proven skill and strength in that fight.\u201d Money remains a challenge for Ms. Pressley. Mr. Capuano raised $838,000 in the first three months of the year, the most recent figures available, compared with $364,000 for Ms. Pressley. He had more than $1.1 million in cash on hand, while she had $260,000. Another challenge for Ms. Pressley is creating ideological separation, because Mr. Capuano has an established progressive voting record in Congress. Ms. Pressley said she knows she\u2019s the underdog, but she still sees Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s victory as a tipping point. \u201cAt the women\u2019s march, we held signs that said, \u2018Today we march, tomorrow we run,\u2019\u201d Ms. Pressley said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t believe us, but it\u2019s coming to pass.

      "content": " From the moment President Trump began speaking Tuesday night, in an Oval Office address urging the public to support his controversial border wall, Democrats who may run for the White House in 2020 were responding in real time with sharp criticisms and common themes: \u2022 Mr. Trump is holding federal workers \u201chostage\u201d \u2014 a popular word in the responses \u2014 and causing them economic hardship. \u2022 A wall would be ineffective and \u201cmedieval,\u201d another popular word. \u2022 The president\u2019s willingness to shut down the government over his demand for a wall has actually harmed border security by denying pay to Customs and Border Protection officials. \u2022 Mr. Trump, not congressional Democrats, is responsible for the shutdown. The Democrats repeatedly noted that the Senate unanimously passed a bill last month that would have kept the government open. \u2022 There is no immigration crisis at the border, and any crisis that does exist is a humanitarian one caused by the president himself.

      "author": "Emily Cochrane",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Jamaal Bowman, a middle school principal from the Bronx, said Tuesday that he would take on Representative Eliot L. Engel, the 16-term New York Democrat who leads the House Foreign Affairs Committee, joining a rapidly multiplying slate of liberal primary challengers to powerful incumbents in 2020. Mr. Bowman has secured the backing of the liberal insurgent group Justice Democrats, setting up what could be a crucial test of whether such groups can translate their grass-roots activism into electoral victories against the party establishment. But he is also the third candidate to challenge Mr. Engel from the left, illustrating a major question confronting progressives: Could the surge of liberal energy end up smothering itself, drawing an influx of challengers who scrap for the same votes while allowing entrenched incumbents to coast by? That has not dissuaded Mr. Bowman and other candidates from announcing their intent to run early in the election cycle, determined to use a quick entry to woo grass-roots donors and build a campaign infrastructure. \u201cI\u2019m inspired by all of the new lifestyles injected into Congress and the new ideas,\u201d said Mr. Bowman, who helped found the Cornerstone Academy for Social Action in New York. Mr. Bowman said he was also inspired by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and her stunning defeat last year of Joseph Crowley of New York, the No. 4 Democrat in the House at the time. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez was also backed by Justice Democrats. Most such upstart candidates in 2018 were not so fortunate, however. Of those Justice Democrats backed, only about one-third won their primary, and most of those lost the general election. Now, many on the left worry that the unusually high number of primary challengers \u2014 and the fact that many more could still jump in \u2014 could only complicate the situation. \u201cIt\u2019s different when there are two challengers versus 10,\u201d said Andom Ghebreghiorgis, a teacher and another challenger to Mr. Engel who, like Mr. Bowman, has vowed to pursue progressive policies, including \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d the Green New Deal and changes to public education. \u201cThere may come a point where the progressives in the community may have to come together and decide: What are the next steps that we\u2019re looking to do?\u201d Complicating matters further for his challengers, Mr. Engel is likely to be a difficult target to take down. He began his more than 30 years in Congress by unseating a popular incumbent and defeated three primary challengers in 2018, with nearly 74 percent of the vote. \u201cEvery two years I bring my progressive record to the people of the 16th District and ask them for their support,\u201d Mr. Engel said in a statement. \u201cAs always, I will continue to do all I can as a member of Congress to earn their vote.\u201d The campaign arm for House Democrats, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, has vowed to defend incumbents, brushing off the ire of liberal Democrats as it broke ties with pollsters and political consultants who work for primary challengers. And some strategists say that while warding off so many challengers may be costly, having them split the vote is ultimately beneficial for the incumbent. \u201cOnce you have one primary challenger, you would like to have several more,\u201d said Steve Israel, a retired congressman from New York who once led the Democratic campaign arm. \u201cThey dilute the base.\u201d Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, said in an interview that his group had debated having progressive challengers pledge to leave a race if a front-runner was clearly established against the incumbent. Aware of the influx of candidates, several liberal insurgent groups, like Democracy for America and Justice Democrats, are embarking on a more intentional process of endorsing candidates this election cycle. Mr. Bowman is the first New York candidate Justice Democrats has endorsed, and only the second candidate this year. (Last election, the group endorsed 78 candidates and recruited 12 to run for office.) \u201cWe\u2019re always going to take risks,\u201d said Alexandra Rojas, the executive director of Justice Democrats. But, she added, \u201cwe\u2019re going to be a lot more intentional about going into districts and then doing a handful of seats.\u201d About 70 House districts held by Democrats have at least one challenger filed with the Federal Election Commission, months before the primary elections. Many candidates, like Marie Newman, a contender against Representative Daniel Lipinski in Illinois\u2019s Third Congressional District, are trying for a second time after narrowly losing their races in 2018. \u201cEveryone should have the right to run,\u201d said Adem Bunkeddeko, a political organizer who said he was likely to repeat his run against Representative Yvette Clarke, Democrat of New York, after narrowly losing the last primary. \u201cThe question then becomes, do you have the right to be taken seriously? There\u2019s a difference between the two.\u201d \u201cYes, there will be a glut,\u201d he added. \u201cBut you\u2019ll start to see some refining of the process as we go along.\u201d New York, with 15 registered candidates, appears primed to be a likely contender for a widespread effort to rebel against the establishment, pitting longtime incumbents against younger members of the Democratic Party\u2019s left flank. Among the targets in the state are Representatives Carolyn B. Maloney; Kathleen Rice; Jerrold Nadler, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee; and Tom Suozzi. But after Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s upset victory, as well as that of Ayanna S. Pressley, a Boston city councilwoman who toppled Michael Capuano, a 10-term Massachusetts congressman, members are also more aware of the potential potency of a primary challenge. \u201cThere\u2019s been this awakening in the city,\u201d said Monica Klein, the co-founder of Seneca Strategies in New York, adding that a flood of women have reached out to her company for advice on how to jump-start campaigns against Democratic incumbents. \u201cThey\u2019re saying, \u2018Why should I wait?\u2019\u201d",

      "content": " \u201cSpeak truth, sis!\u201d \n\u2014 Rashida Tlaib to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, both newly elected congresswomen, in a message on Instagram It was not terribly surprising this week when yet another one of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s tweets went viral, this time in response to an article about House Speaker Paul Ryan. Every word Ms. Ocasio-Cortez types on social media, it seems, is ripe for scrutiny. What caught my eye, though, was not the criticism she regularly levels at conservatives, but the validation \u2014 a digital fist-bump, almost \u2014 she received from her soon-to-be fellow Democratic congresswoman. \u201cSpeak truth, sis!\u201d proclaimed Rashida Tlaib, of Michigan, responding to her tweet. Some might say it was \u201cShine Theory\u201d in action \u2014 a term coined by the feminist podcasters Ann Friedman and Aminatou Sow to describe women who make a concerted effort to support one another. (In Ms. Sow\u2019s words: \u201cI don\u2019t shine if you don\u2019t shine.\u201d) In fact, in an exchange of mutual admiration on Twitter on Wednesday, Ayanna Pressley, Massachusetts\u2019s first African-American congresswoman, thanked Ms. Ocasio-Cortez for \u201cliving #ShineTheory out loud.\u201d (Ms. Ocasio-Cortez had tweeted that she was \u201cso incredibly proud\u201d of Ms. Pressley, pointing to a Buzzfeed article about her.) It\u2019s a camaraderie that\u2019s been on full display among the Democratic newcomers since November\u2019s election. Their message: We\u2019re cool, we\u2019re transparent and we\u2019ve got each other\u2019s backs. [Sign up here to get future installments of the Gender Letter delivered to your inbox!] In particular, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, of New York \u2014 the youngest woman ever elected to Congress, at 29 \u2014 has been leading the charge to humanize politics and exposed some of the inner workings of Congress in a way that\u2019s never been done, as my colleague Talya Minsberg recently put it. Throughout the midterm primaries, congressional orientation and beyond, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez has posted personal photos and Instagram videos (including live videos, some up to an hour long), effectively bringing her followers along for the ride. And her political cohorts have followed suit, attracting plenty of online attention. A couple of weeks ago, in a lengthy post she titled \u201cCongress Camp,\u201d she outlined, in six steps, how party leadership is formally chosen. She also shared a video of herself with Ilhan Omar, a Minnesotan and one of the first two Muslim women ever elected to Congress. \u201cIlhan and I showed up in the same outfit today,\u201d she said with Ms. Omar\u2019s arm draped around her, a LOL emoji on the screen. In another instance, Ms. Tlaib, the other Muslim woman elected \u2014 standing shoulder to shoulder with Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, Ms. Pressley and Ms. Omar \u2014 declared in a caption: #DreamTeam. The display stands in contrast with the G.O.P.\u2019s Instagram presence, or lack thereof. Senator Ted Cruz, of Texas, who assumed that office in 2013, is a top Instagram user among Republican politicians, but his page consists primarily of posed photo-ops and videos of Fox News appearances. The Democratic freshman class, meanwhile, is seemingly trying to shed all pretense in favor of a personal, unfiltered approach. \u201cWhat she\u2019s saying is: \u2018Hey, develop these skills alongside of me and we will be a community, we\u2019ll be a force,\u2019\u201d said Jennifer Grygiel, an assistant professor at Syracuse University and social media expert, of Ms. Ocasio-Cortez's online presence. \u201cShe\u2019s not just saying, \u2018Hey, support me, support me, support me.\u2019\u201d ______ 24 PERCENT That\u2019s how many congressional seats will be filled by women come January. For all the victories of the \u201cYear of the Woman,\u201d gender parity in American politics is far from realized, motivating activists to keep the momentum up. ______ ______ In 1889, five women biked 100 miles a day for six days straight in New York City \u2014 prompting The New York Times to declare \u201cconclusively that women have strength and endurance often equal to men.\u201d Huzzah! And yet \u2026 the article, titled \u201cWeak Women,\u201d went on to ask why, if that were the case, were women \u201cpale, sallow, troubled with many weaknesses.\u201d The answer was simple: because women \u201cdo not observe the laws of health and keep their bodies as they should\u201d \u2014 whatever that means. But fear not. The Times offered a suggestion on how to remedy this problem, and actually, it may stand the test of time: whiskey. \u201cThe importance of using only pure whiskey cannot be too strongly urged,\u201d the article concluded.

      "author": "Astead W. Herndon",
      "content": " For a two-hour stretch in a packed Times Square hotel ballroom on Friday morning, the full spectrum of the Democratic Party\u2019s stances on racism and racial justice was on display. Kamala Harris, the California senator who is seeking to become the first black woman to be elected president, electrified the crowd by declaring that when \u2014 not if \u2014 she\u2019s elected president she would sign a bill to study reparations for black Americans. \u201cThis is an inflection moment in the history of our country,\u201d Ms. Harris said. \u201cThis is a moment of time where we must restore the significance of truth and justice in this country.\u201d John Hickenlooper, a former governor of Colorado, and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, said they would also support such a bill. Mr. Hickenlooper\u2019s backing showed how even the most moderate members of the Democratic Party have now adopted the explicit language of racial justice activists, and how the issue of reparations continues to roil the 2020 Democratic primary in ways that few could predict. \u201cSlavery is the nagging shame of America,\u201d Mr. Hickenlooper said. \u201cWe must own our past and acknowledge the ongoing consequences of enslaving an entire race of people.\u201d Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts also addressed a group that included civil rights activists and black religious leaders. \u201cWe must take on the disparity within the disparity, the racial disparities which exist in this country, which are growing wider and wider,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. The candidates appeared at the annual conference of the National Action Network, the advocacy group founded by the Rev. Al Sharpton, which has become an essential event for Democrats seeking higher office. For the candidates, it was a prime opportunity to speak directly to an influential segment of the black voting bloc that will be a force in next year\u2019s presidential primaries, particularly in early voting states such as South Carolina. In addition to Ms. Harris, Mr. Hickenlooper, Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren, the early slate of the conference included speeches from Sherrod Brown, the Ohio senator who declined to run for president, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the freshman House member from New York who instantly made an impact on Capitol Hill. \u201cWe can\u2019t sit around for 100 years while the rich and powerful get richer and more powerful and everyone else falls further and further behind,\u201d said Ms. Warren, who used her speech to back another progressive policy idea: the elimination of the Senate filibuster. Ms. Warren has sought to boost a campaign that has struggled with fund-raising by proposing an expansive policy agenda. On Friday she tried to position her ambitious filibuster position as essential, because Republicans would block most progressive legislation aimed at closing the racial wealth gap. \u201cWe can\u2019t sit around for 100 years while climate change destroys our planet, while corruption pervades every nook and cranny of Washington, and while too much of a child\u2019s fate in life still rests on the color of their skin,\u201d Ms. Warren said. \u201cEnough with that.\u201d Ms. Harris, who enjoyed an assumed kinship with the audience because of her identity and historic candidacy, said she would double the size of the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division and focus on white nationalist domestic terrorism. The most liberal candidates, including Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren, focused their speeches on structural injustices, and how a progressive president could use the power of the federal government to improve historically distressed communities. The roster of candidates was a who\u2019s who of prominent Democrats, and similarly powerful figures were scheduled to speak later in the day. Presidential candidates from the Senate, including Cory Booker of New Jersey, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, participated in an afternoon forum with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. Earlier in the week, Stacey Abrams of Georgia and Juli\u00e1n Castro and Beto O\u2019Rourke both of Texas also spoke to the largely black audience. \u201cLet\u2019s call it like it is,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Booker said. \u201cRight now in America, we\u2019ve come to the distraught present that there are more black men under criminal supervision in our country than all the slaves of 1850.\u201d But it was Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, the newly elected representative who has become a leader of the party\u2019s progressive faction and a favorite target of conservatives, who received a hero\u2019s welcome before her remarks. She framed the fight against racism as more than a byproduct of modern political polarization, but a struggle baked into the American story that must be prioritized. She invoked the anniversary on Thursday of the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and the crowd roared in approval. \u201cI find so much of this present moment to be a picking up, a revival, of where King left off,\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said, before being played off to James Brown. \u201cBigotry, sexism, and xenophobia are the easiest ways to distract from substantive discussions of classism.\u201d",

      "author": "Catie Edmondson",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 The House Democratic campaign arm is nearing open warfare with the party\u2019s rising liberal wing as political operatives close to Speaker Nancy Pelosi try to shut down primary challenges before what is likely to be a hard-fought campaign next year to preserve the party\u2019s shaky majority. Progressive Democrats were infuriated last month when Representative Cheri Bustos of Illinois, the chairwoman of the campaign arm, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, moved to protect centrist incumbents by formally breaking committee business ties with political consultants and pollsters who go to work for primary challengers. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York, who owes her seat to a successful primary challenge, went so far as to encourage her 3.8 million Twitter followers to \u201cpause\u201d their donations to the campaign committee in protest. She also started a fund-raising push on her official Twitter account for Representatives Jahana Hayes of Connecticut, Katie Hill of California and Mike Levin of California. That initiative, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said on Twitter, raised $30,000 in roughly two hours. She also helped raise money for Representatives Katie Porter of California and Lauren Underwood of Illinois. The open hostilities are just the latest in the rising tensions between an experienced party establishment focusing on what is possible in the short run and a group of young liberals chafing at such restraint. House Democrats have divided over single-payer \u201cMedicare for all\u201d versus incremental legislation to bolster the Affordable Care Act and over Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Green New Deal versus less ambitious climate change policies. Liberal Democrats and more moderate newcomers from Republican-leaning districts have fought over Republican procedural motions. And divisions on health care, climate change, military spending and tax policy convinced the House Budget Committee chairman, John Yarmuth of Kentucky, last week to give up on drafting a budget that would have laid down a broad legislative agenda for the new Democrat-controlled House. Now that tension has migrated to the mechanics of the 2020 campaign. Ms. Bustos\u2019s rule prohibits Democratic consultants and vendors working for a primary challenger to an incumbent from receiving work from the committee. It comes as ardent liberal organizations like Justice Democrats, emboldened by a pair of high-profile wins in 2018 \u2014 Representative Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez \u2014 are aggressively gearing up to challenge centrist or old-line Democrats with liberal candidates. In the latest swipe in a fight that has erupted into open hostilities, a coalition of progressive groups on Friday introduced an online database of go-to vendors for insurgent candidates emblazoned with the heading, \u201cDespite the D.C.C.C.\u2019s bullying, we\u2019re still going to work on primaries.\u201d One group, the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, said Friday that it was exploring a challenge against Representative Richard E. Neal of Massachusetts, the chairman of the powerful Ways and Means Committee, because he has not committed to holding hearings on the single-payer health care system known as \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d At the helm of that panel, Mr. Neal has been on the front lines of conducting oversight on President Trump\u2019s finances, and last week requested six years of his personal tax returns. \u201cWe reject the D.C.C.C.\u2019s attempt to hoard power, which will only serve to keep that talent pool \u2014 and Congress itself \u2014 disproportionately white and male,\u201d Mar\u00eda Urbina, the national political director for Indivisible, a progressive grass-roots group, said of the campaign committee. \u201cIncumbents who engage fully with their constituents shouldn\u2019t fear primaries and shouldn\u2019t rely on the national institutions like the D.C.C.C. to suppress challenges before voters ever have a say.\u201d Party leaders and the campaign arm have stood by Ms. Bustos\u2019s moves, arguing that the committee\u2019s mandate is to protect the new majority by protecting incumbents \u2014 and that putting a longstanding rule in writing simply increases transparency. Primary challenges, even in solid Democratic districts, harm the mission of holding the majority, they argue, because incumbents fighting a primary challenge cannot raise money and help other Democrats in more marginal districts. \u201cI support the notion that the primary purpose of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is to elect Democrats in tough districts, so we can either win the majority or hold the majority,\u201d said Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the No. 4 Democrat. A spokesman for the committee said that Ms. Bustos, who hails from a Midwestern district that voted for Mr. Trump in 2016, was fulfilling a campaign promise she made to Democrats that as the chairwoman, she would support incumbents. And some at the campaign arm are frustrated that the codification of the longstanding policy has received more attention than the enforcement of a new rule that requires vendors to meet certain diversity standards, including employing more racially diverse, veteran, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or disabled staff. The new policy is unlikely to change. But the ire from the left flank may only grow. \u201cPrimaries are often the only way that underrepresented and working-class people are able to have a shot at pursuing elected office,\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said. \u201cI think that it can reduce the odds of us getting really strong representation. We need to have kind of a farm system for the next generation.\u201d Other House Democrats, such as Representative Mark Pocan of Wisconsin, a leader of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, are taking a cooler tone. But on Thursday, he could not resist a jab at Ms. Bustos on the radio program \u201cThe Bill Press Show.\u201d \u201cWe were trying to keep this in the family, but unfortunately this morning, I saw Cheri Bustos, after she asked us not to do it publicly, came out and decided to talk about it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe progressive caucus doesn\u2019t go out and recruit people to run against incumbents, but I think it looks awful for the Democratic Party to be undemocratic.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the wrong path for us to be taking,\u201d he continued. \u201cThis was a misguided action, and rather than review it, she\u2019s trying to double down on it.\u201d The decision has pleased moderates and veterans in the more centrist New Democrat Coalition, in the Blue Dog Coalition, a fiscally conservative group of Democrats, and in the Congressional Black Caucus, who have been angered by some of the incumbents that outside liberal groups have chosen to target. Many of the candidates wooed in the last campaign cycle by Justice Democrats would have run in districts that lean Republican. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee had to work hard to beat those challenges back, worried that a triumph by Justice Democrats in the primary would have cost the party a possible victory in the general election. Defending the campaign arm\u2019s decision, Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, the majority whip, recalled a past primary against Representative Bennie Thompson, Democrat of Mississippi. \u201cAn African-American got in the race against him running to his right and then he looked up and there was this Democratic pollster working for his opponent,\u201d Mr. Clyburn told National Journal. \u201cHe\u2019s paying dues to the D.C.C.C., who\u2019s giving a contract to that person and then that person ended up working for that opponent. There\u2019s something wrong with that.\u201d",

      "subtitle": "Can the Ocasio-Cortez Playbook Work in the Heartland? Cori Bush Is TryingRunning against an esteemed incumbent in a St. Louis district, Ms. Bush is hoping to parlay the energy of the insurgent left into another surprise victory.By Sydney EmberPRINT EDITIONCourting People, Not Party: Can a Progressive Prevail in the Heartland?|August 6, 2018, Page A13",
      "author": "Sydney Ember",
      "content": " ST. LOUIS \u2014 Cori Bush was running the Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez playbook. A progressive political outsider, Ms. Bush had promised \u201cbig change\u201d for a St. Louis congressional district that has had the same representative for nearly two decades. She had championed Medicare for all, a $15 minimum wage and tuition-free public college. She had vowed to speak for those who felt unheard. \u201cWe should have a voice in our community, and we should be important,\u201d she told a handful of black business owners at a coffee shop here last week. \u201cThat\u2019s something that I want to take to D.C.\u201d Now, just days before Tuesday\u2019s primary against a powerful and long-tenured incumbent, Ms. Bush\u2019s campaign has become a test case for how effectively the insurgent left can convert its energy into upheaval at the ballot box \u2014 and whether Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s success in New York City can be replicated in other regions. In Missouri, the conventional wisdom suggests this: The revolution may not have arrived in St. Louis just yet. Ms. Bush, 42, a community activist, ordained pastor and nurse, is a decided underdog in her race against William Lacy Clay, who is seeking his 10th term in Congress. Strategists and officials here say Mr. Clay \u2014 whose father, Bill Clay, helped found the Congressional Black Caucus \u2014 is simply too respected, and too entrenched in the political fabric of this heavily Democratic district that is roughly 50 percent black. And they say a Midwestern state like Missouri is too steeped in tradition to adopt this new brand of progressivism that looks a lot like socialism. \u201cTrends get to the heartland late,\u201d said Jay Nixon, the former Missouri governor and a Democrat, \u201cand I think this is a trend that\u2019s going to go over us.\u201d [Here\u2019s what\u2019s coming up next on the primary calendar.] Ms. Bush, who made her name in the district as a prominent activist in the aftermath of the 2014 police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, brushed off the idea that Mr. Clay would never lose. \u201cThe theory that people say, \u2018Well, that\u2019s such a machine and we have to be loyal to who was there before\u2019? I heard it a lot at first. I don\u2019t hear it as much anymore,\u201d she said in an interview between campaign events last week. \u201cI\u2019m hearing more people saying that we want change.\u201d Ms. Bush\u2019s campaign, while conveying the passion of the far left, also underscores the growing divisions in the Democratic Party between those who believe the need for new thinking outweighs deference to party stalwarts, and those who defend the value of experience and tradition. Some party leaders have cautioned that the insurgent left is practicing a form of protest politics that is not suited to actual governing. \u201cBeing a progressive is one thing,\u201d Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, a member of the black caucus and the third-ranking Democrat, said in an interview. \u201cBeing practical with your progressiveness is another.\u201d The practicalities of winning races has factored into other primaries involving progressive black candidates. In Massachusetts, for instance, the political arm of the Congressional Black Caucus backed the incumbent, Michael E. Capuano, over Ayanna Pressley, a Boston City Council member who would be the state\u2019s first nonwhite female House member. And Mr. Clyburn said he planned to campaign in Florida for Stephanie Murphy, a blue-dog Democrat facing a challenge from Chardo Richardson, an Air Force veteran who is backed by the progressive group Brand New Congress. \u201cI really don\u2019t believe this thing is as generational as people seem to be wanting to make it,\u201d Mr. Clyburn said. \u201cIt\u2019s about your vision.\u201d Because of Mr. Clay\u2019s stature in his Missouri district, Ms. Bush mostly avoids direct attacks on him \u2014 more often referring to him as \u201cthe incumbent\u201d or \u201cthe other person.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not about him,\u201d she said after a late lunch at a White Castle. She walked gingerly, the result of a back busted by a bad car accident in April. But she is unapologetic about challenging another African-American candidate, and a respected member of the Congressional Black Caucus at that. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect the Democratic Party or anybody to support me,\u201d she said. \u201cI knew that this would just be totally the people.\u201d Mr. Clay, 62, who was first elected to the House in 2000, has dispatched challengers before and insists he will do so again in Tuesday\u2019s primary. In 2016, in the wake of the protests in Ferguson, when the district was perhaps most agitating for change, Mr. Clay beat his main primary opponent with more than 60 percent of the vote. \u201cI smoked her,\u201d Mr. Clay said in an interview after a ribbon-cutting ceremony for a new light rail station. \u201cThis is what I do. I\u2019m used to this.\u201d He has won all of his nine general elections for the House with at least 70 percent of the vote. He acknowledged, however, that while he considers himself a progressive, candidates like Ms. Bush and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez have changed the word\u2019s definition, pushing it to the left. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the new litmus test is,\u201d he said, \u201cand I\u2019m really not sure if I can pass that according to some.\u201d Born in St. Louis, Ms. Bush has campaigned on a compelling back story that she says makes her an ideal leader for her district. She said she is advocating for a $15 minimum wage because she knows what it is like to make $5.35 an hour. She wants to do more to support the homeless because she once lived out of her car, an old Ford Explorer. In the mornings, she said, she would go to a McDonald\u2019s to wash up and mix formula for her infant daughter. But she earned a nursing degree. And she became a pastor. Ms. Bush is viewed as a political newcomer, but this is not her first time running for office. After the Ferguson shooting, she ran for the United States Senate in 2016. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a symbolic run \u2014 I was running to win,\u201d she said. She lost her primary by more than 50 points. But Ms. Bush said she learned a lot from her defeat, including the importance of meeting people face to face. Her run also attracted the attention of Brand New Congress, the progressive group that also backs Ms. Ocasio-Cortez; last year, Ms. Bush was the first 2018 candidate whom Brand New Congress endorsed. [Read more about Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez campaigning in the Midwest.] Buoyed by Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s victory and a visit she made to campaign with Ms. Bush last month, Ms. Bush has picked up some momentum. She got a shout-out recently on \u201cThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert.\u201d On Wednesday, she secured an endorsement from the progressive group Democracy for America. Nina Turner, the head of the Bernie Sanders-aligned advocacy group Our Revolution, campaigned with Ms. Bush this weekend. Even those who back Ms. Bush expect many voters, and older black voters in particular, to support Mr. Clay.That has prompted Ms. Bush at times to tailor her message to a younger audience. When she filmed a radio ad last week, she had the producer underlay it with Cardi B\u2019s \u201cI Like It,\u201d in part because she and her advisers thought it would help her appeal to young voters. She was worried, however, about the optics of using a song with a Latin sound, because she said she had been accused of not caring enough about the black community. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like I should be solely focused on just issues that affect black people directly,\u201d she said later. \u201cWe have to all work together.\u201d Despite the long odds Ms. Bush faces, there may be no better race to assess the actual power of an anti-establishment progressive message than here, where Mr. Clay, and his father before him, have held power for the last half-century. Ms. Bush, for her part, remains undaunted, especially after seeing Ms. Ocasio-Cortez win. \u201cBefore it was kind of like, \u2018It is an uphill battle but you might be able to do it,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cNow, it\u2019s like, \u2018O.K., we think you\u2019re going to do it.\u2019\u201d",

They\u2019re Already Eyeing Their Next Targets.The small grass-roots organization wants to replace more centrist Democrats with liberal candidates \u2014 and that has made some lawmakers uneasy.By Emily CochranePRINT EDITIONLiberal Group Is Seeking Its Next Ocasio-Cortez. (Or Two. Or Five or Ten.)|February 24, 2019, Page A15",
      "author": "Emily Cochrane",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Less than a month into the 116th Congress, Sean McElwee, the liberal co-founder of Data for Progress, rattled off a list of sitting Democratic House members who should face a primary from the left, his exposition punctuated with dismissive expletives. There was Representative Stephen F. Lynch of Massachusetts, a moderate, perennial primary target who voted against the Affordable Care Act in 2010; Representative Henry Cuellar of Texas, who raised money for a Republican House incumbent last year as a popular Democratic challenger was closing in; Representative Daniel Lipinski, an old-school Chicago-area politician who has voted against gay marriage and tried to sink Obamacare; and Representative Eliot L. Engel of New York, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee who has clashed with one of the highest-profile liberal freshmen, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota. Mr. McElwee, a pollster and political adviser, has floated all of those names to Justice Democrats, a small grass-roots organization that burst onto the political scene last year after coordinating Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s stunning primary defeat of Joseph Crowley of New York, the No. 4 Democrat in the House at the time. \u201cThese are a lot of ideological contests for the soul of the Democratic Party,\u201d Mr. McElwee said. So far, Justice Democrats has publicly confirmed its intent on only one primary challenge \u2014 against Mr. Cuellar, who infuriated the left when he raised money for Representative John Carter as the Democratic challenger, M.J. Hegar, was gaining traction. But more are coming, and the organization\u2019s ambitions to replace more centrist Democrats with liberal candidates have inspired other clusters of insurgency \u2014 and pushed progressive policies to the forefront of the liberal agenda. The conflicts \u2014 both generational and ideological \u2014 burst into the open again on Friday when children with the Sunrise Movement, a youth climate-change advocacy group, pressed Senator Dianne Feinstein, a moderate California Democrat, to embrace the so-called Green New Deal in an extended confrontation that instantly went viral. Justice Democrats, built in part by former staff members for Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, has made some lawmakers uneasy \u2014 and invited comparisons to conservative groups that have bedeviled Republican leaders and pulled that party to the right. Democratic lawmakers say their \u201cbig tent\u201d party must embrace varying degrees of liberal ideology to match the House districts they hope to represent. \u201cI support the principle of open competition,\u201d said Representative Ro Khanna, Democrat of California and an ardent liberal whom Justice Democrats claims as one of its own. But, Mr. Khanna added: \u201cI\u2019m not going to be spending any of my efforts recruiting, supporting candidates against my colleagues. I\u2019d rather we build and form a consensus.\u201d Waleed Shahid, Justice Democrats\u2019 communications director, said primaries give the most involved, activist voters in solid blue districts the chance to choose what kind of Democrat they want representing them in Congress. \u201cIt takes movements like ours to push parties to prioritize what the base wants and what the values of the party are,\u201d Mr. Shahid said. \u201cThat is the role of our movement, to give a policy vision for this country to a party that often lacks a clear policy vision.\u201d A spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the campaign arm of House Democrats, said its focus remained on defeating President Trump and expanding the current House majority. (The committee has announced a slate of 32 seats  held by Republicans it intends to challenge.) Mr. Cuellar, asked last month about Justice Democrats\u2019 challenge, reminded reporters that this would not be his first round beating back a primary opponent. \u201cWhat happened to the Democratic Party being a tent?\u201d Mr. Cuellar said as he described a moderate Democratic constituency in his district, which stretches from the Mexican border to the suburbs of San Antonio. \u201cAn outside group that thinks they know southwest Texas politics better than I do are going to find out.\u201d Both supporters and opponents of Justice Democrats say that with the 2018 election barely in the rearview mirror, it is too early to assess how primary challenges might disrupt the Democratic field. But in a presidential year, when turnout in the primaries is often much higher than in midterm election seasons, Justice Democrats has the potential to be far more disruptive than it was in 2018, and the group and its allies are in a fighting mood. \u201cWe should absolutely be allowed to contest what it means to be a Democrat,\u201d Mr. McElwee said in an interview. \u201cYou can\u2019t have a tent that includes both people of color and people who work to undermine the rights and humanity of people of color.\u201d He pointed to Gov. Ralph Northam of Virginia, who defeated a more progressive Democrat, Tom Perriello, in the primary, only to be consumed in scandal for his use of blackface in the 1980s. Liberal primary challengers are not new to the Democratic Party, but they can be costly. Steve Israel, a retired congressman from New York who once led the campaign committee, recalled instances in which lawmakers delayed contributions to the tight races of their colleagues as they fought off primary challengers in their safe districts. Now, the challenges carry more weight. \u201cIt didn\u2019t have the energy and the intensity that it does now,\u201d Mr. Israel said, adding, \u201cEvery challenge has to be taken seriously.\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez caught Mr. Crowley off guard, but this time, Justice Democrats\u2019 targets will see a challenge coming \u2014 although awareness is not necessarily a guarantee for survival. Months after Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s victory, Ayanna S. Pressley, a Boston city councilwoman endorsed by the group, successfully toppled Michael Capuano, a 10-term Massachusetts congressman. Mr. Shahid acknowledged that Justice Democrats, with 12 full-time and part-time staff members, had some missteps to learn from. He said the organization had to learn from \u201cstretching ourselves too thin and not being as laser focused.\u201d He noted that the group would back a smaller group of candidates and focus solely on races in secure Democratic districts. Group members, during a conference call last week, said they had begun reaching out to people to discuss possible campaigns, but had not closed the endorsement window. In 2018, Justice Democrats endorsed 78 candidates and recruited 12 to run for office, serving as a grass-roots political consulting firm and jump-starting campaigns. Out of those 12, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez was the only one who won her general election. Six other endorsed candidates \u2014 three incumbents and three freshmen \u2014 also made it to Congress. All seven are in the House. Many of the group\u2019s candidates challenged races in districts that leaned Republican, and in several cases the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee worked hard to beat them back, worried that a Justice Democrats triumph in the primary would cost the party a potential seat. Lizzie Fletcher, for instance, beat the Justice Democrats candidate, Laura Moser, in a primary in the Houston suburbs, then went on to defeat the Republican incumbent, John Culberson, in a race that may have been far more difficult for her to win as a more liberal candidate. In more Democratic districts, candidates supported by Justice Democrats came up disappointingly short. Marie Newman\u2019s challenge to Mr. Lipinski, backed by some sitting Democratic lawmakers, was seen as a real opportunity to take down a congressman increasingly loathed by his own party. She lost, though Justice Democrats speculates that had her primary been after Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s, the momentum would have lifted her to victory. This time around, the organization intends to spend more on fewer candidates and is working to build a larger infrastructure and a bigger fund-raising arm. During the monthly call last week, members outlined a new fellowship program in which people could learn about staffing a campaign and becoming part of a more permanent foundation for candidates\u2019 races. Candidates are required to pledge not to take any corporate political action committee or lobbying money, and are expected to be aligned with Justice Democrats\u2019 platform, which includes abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement, advocating free public colleges and trade schools, and ending the death penalty. Mr. Shahid frequently raises comparisons to, among other movements, the abolitionists in the Civil War-era Republican Party. Eric Foner, a historian and professor emeritus at Columbia University, said the group could learn from them. \u201cYou have to play the long game if you don\u2019t command a majority right now,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not advocating that they be quiet, but if you don\u2019t have a majority, you\u2019re automatically playing the longer game.\u201d Mr. Shahid, Mr. McElwee and their allies argue that they do not need long-game patience. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, Representative Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ms. Omar, all Justice Democrats candidates, have already pushed strong climate change measures, higher taxes on the wealthy and support for a Palestinian state into the mainstream debate surrounding Democratic ideals. \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d a tenet of the group\u2019s platform, and the Green New Deal have become critical aspects of the Democratic primary race for president in 2020. Even sitting Democrats have felt pressure to endorse the programs \u2014 or, like Ms. Feinstein, have faced viral wrath for appearing to not take the platforms seriously. \u201cWe can\u2019t have a 15-year power-building strategy,\u201d Mr. McElwee said. \u201cWe have to have power now. We have to have it next election.\u201d Some of the group\u2019s potency stems from the viral might of Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and her close ties to the group: Two of her top staff members helped found Justice Democrats, and Mr. Shahid worked on her campaign. And she appeared in an eight-minute video with the organization\u2019s founders that circulated last month, explaining how Justice Democrats propelled her campaign into existence and success. \u201cIt\u2019s an uncomfortable feeling to go against the grain, but that\u2019s what we\u2019re here for,\u201d said Corbin Trent, a spokesman for Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and a founder of the group. \u201cHopefully,\u201d he added, \u201cthings are getting shook up a little bit.\u201d",

      "author": "Sydney Ember",
      "content": " ST. LOUIS, Mo. \u2014 Less than four weeks after she stunned the political establishment with an upset victory in a New York House primary, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez stepped out onto the national campaign stage for the first time this week, an emerging star of the insurgent left bringing her message to the heartland. She campaigned in two conservative Midwestern states at rallies for House candidates who are also delivering a progressive message to their constituents. \u201cChange takes courage,\u201d she told a packed auditorium at a downtown convention center in Wichita on Friday, in the first of two appearances in Kansas before heading to Missouri on Saturday. \u201cChange takes guts.\u201d \u201cWhat you have shown me, and what we will show in the Bronx, is that working people in Kansas share the same values \u2014 the same values \u2014 as working people anywhere else,\u201d she said. It was a message that had carried Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, 28, to victory in New York last month and all but assured her election to Congress in a heavily Democratic district in Queens and the Bronx. And whether establishment politicians like it or not, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, a Democratic socialist, is now rushing to transport her unapologetically left-wing message to other parts of the country. In Wichita, she shared the energy with the white-haired lion of the left, Bernie Sanders, who came on stage after her to deafening cheers, telling the crowd, \u201cWhether you live in Vermont or the Bronx or Kansas, we share common hopes and aspirations that are much greater than the superficial differences that may separate us.\u201d But even those who came primarily to see Mr. Sanders were aware of Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and her message. Many had seen her on social media and television and said they were inspired by her youth and enthusiasm. Nicholas Beddow, 25, a preschool teacher wearing a vintage \u201cBernie for President\u201c T-shirt, said he hadn\u2019t heard of Ms. Ocasio-Cortez until she won her primary, but now was a full-throated supporter. \u201cShe\u2019s very strong,\u201d he said. The fact that she is young, he said, \u201ccarries the progressive message further.\u201d He said he felt that message could resonate, even in an area labeled the Bible Belt. \u201cI\u2019m thinking we can give it a blue buckle right in the middle,\u201d he said. That could be a tough sell in a state that hasn\u2019t sent a Democrat to Congress in a decade. But Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and Mr. Sanders nevertheless were campaigning here and in Kansas City, Kan., on Friday in support of two candidates, Brent Welder and James Thompson, who are running progressive, grass-roots campaigns in districts Democrats consider winnable. In St. Louis on Saturday, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez campaigned with Cori Bush, a community activist and nurse, whom some members of the progressive left hope can become another standard-bearer for their message. After knocking on doors together during the day, they appeared at a rally at night, with Ms. Ocasio-Cortez bounding onto the stage at an eclectic concert venue to raucous cheers. Speaking to a youthful, cocktail-sipping crowd, she called for a different kind of political leader but did not directly attack Ms. Bush\u2019s opponent, William Lacy Clay, a popular nine-term Democrat and a member of the Congressional Black Caucus. \u201dMore than ever, we need a salt-of-the-earth Congress,\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said. And she seemed somewhat uncomfortable with the recent assertion that she was the party\u2019s future. \u201dNo person is the future of the Democratic Party,\u201d she said, later adding, \u201cThe future of the Democratic Party is not in my hands.\u201d The trip to the Midwest was a critical test for whether she and her Bronx-born brand of Democratic socialism resonate in the heartland \u2014 and whether she is overplaying her hand. In the weeks since her primary victory, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez has publicly endorsed a flurry of candidates across the country. On Twitter and in interviews with the media, she has championed a progressive policy agenda that includes Medicare for all, tuition-free public college, ending private prisons and abolishing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. While she has quickly become a political sensation, however, she has also revealed her inexperience. She provoked some outrage by referring to Israel\u2019s \u201coccupation\u201d of Palestine, for instance, saying later that she was \u201cnot the expert on geopolitics on this issue.\u201d She incorrectly said unemployment was low because \u201ceveryone has two jobs.\u201d Still, her appearance in Kansas alongside Mr. Sanders was the clearest indication yet that she views herself as one of progressivism\u2019s next ambassadors \u2014 and that far-left Democrats, at least, see her as a key player in the party\u2019s effort to retake the House. \u201cIf there was a better way to say it\u2019s the highest, the best, the number one event we\u2019ve ever had, I would,\u201d Mr. Thompson said in an interview the day before Friday\u2019s rally. If candidates can show that even Kansas \u201ccan be changed running on progressive principles,\u201d he added, \u201cthen it\u2019s possible anywhere.\u201d Conservatives in the state have taken notice of the support for progressive ideas that Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and Mr. Sanders have championed. Earlier this week Mr. Trump tweeted support for Mr. Welder\u2019s Republican opponent, Kevin Yoder. And Mr. Thompson\u2019s opponent, Ron Estes, the incumbent, sounded the alarm on the Wichita rally even as it was taking place. \u201cAt this very moment self-described socialists Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are hosting a rally in Wichita for Kansas Democrats,\u201d he wrote in an email to supporters. \u201cTheir goal is ambitious, extreme and dangerous.\u201d Despite all the enthusiasm surrounding Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, many establishment Democrats have bristled at the suggestion that the far-left ideas espoused by her and Mr. Sanders represent the party\u2019s position. And they reject the notion that Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s victory last month over Joseph Crowley, the fourth-ranking House Democrat, signaled a fundamental dissatisfaction with the party\u2019s aging leaders. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s swift rise has also exposed divisions in the party over whether the insurgent candidates can capture victories across the country in general elections, against Republicans. In an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal this week, Joe Lieberman, the former Democrat-turned-independent Senator from Connecticut, urged voters to vote for Mr. Crowley on a third-party line instead of Ms. Ocasio-Cortez because, he said, her policies were too far left. \u201cHer election in November would make it harder for Congress to stop fighting and start fixing problems,\u201d he wrote. Some political strategists question whether Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s presence in districts vastly different from hers will turn off, rather than invigorate, voters. \u201cI would hope that she would keep her eye on the critical need to elect a House Democratic majority to stop Donald Trump and allow and trust candidates to run their campaigns in a way that results in the majority that we need,\u201d said Steve Israel, a former chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and longtime New York representative. \u201cThere\u2019s an important role for her to play in progressive districts, and with vitally needed base voters. But a message that resonates in some districts could seem out of tune in others.\u201d But supporters of Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Democratic socialism have primarily exhibited a sense of optimism \u2014 in her, in her star power, in the progressive message generally \u2014 since her victory. They note that Mr. Sanders won the 2016 presidential primaries in both Kansas and Michigan and hope they can build on that energy. They also point to the fact that many Democratic candidates have embraced key pieces of the progressive policy agenda, including Medicare for all and a higher minimum wage. For his part, Mr. Sanders has said he sees Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s success as proof that his progressive message is not only spreading, but winning. (He did not endorse Ms. Ocasio-Cortez.) His swing with Ms. Ocasio-Cortez through Kansas came about organically, according to a person familiar with the decision process, after they realized they were both interested in going to the state to support candidates there. Both were eager to show that a message that works in Burlington, Vt., and New York City can also work in a red state. The same goes for Michigan, where Ms. Ocasio-Cortez will campaign next weekend with Abdul El-Sayed, a former director of Detroit\u2019s health department, who is running for governor. Inspired by her message and campaign style, Dr. El-Sayed first connected with Ms. Ocasio-Cortez on Twitter. He now hopes he can one day tell his young daughter about the night \u201cAuntie Alexandria\u201d won in New York. \u201cAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s win is a validation point,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cShe showed us how it\u2019s done.\u201d",

      "author": "Jennifer Steinhauer",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 A move by House Democratic leaders to thwart party members from mounting primary challenges to incumbents, even in safe Democratic districts, could have the unintended consequence of arresting the party\u2019s shift toward a more female and racially diverse caucus, one of its most striking achievements of the last election. Last week, a Democratic political consultant with longstanding ties to the party\u2019s campaign committees quit a senior-partner position at the firm Deliver Strategies after it, like most dominant campaign outfits, agreed to comply with a Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee policy barring it from conducting business with a primary opponent of a sitting Democrat. Her reason: She feared the policy\u2019s impact on female challengers. \u201cIt is hard enough for challengers, for a lot of reasons,\u201d said the consultant, Amy Pritchard, who worked last year for Representative Ayanna Pressley, Democrat of Massachusetts, in her successful campaign to defeat a 10-term Democratic incumbent. \u201cAnd this policy is a bridge too far. I\u2019d like to see a majority of women in Congress, and it\u2019s not going to happen with this policy.\u201d The D.C.C.C. is ostensibly out to protect sitting Democrats from having to worry about primaries, and instead focus their energy and money on fighting off Republicans. Some female and minority candidates did well in open primaries and beat Republican incumbents last year, even in majority-white districts. They will benefit from the new policy, even as many of them are critical of it. But most insurgent Democrats set their sights on incumbents in safe Democratic seats, making the case that they are fresh faces who represent change. The new policy will most likely block candidates seeking to follow in the footsteps of Ms. Pressley, who is black, and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, who is of Puerto Rican descent, both of whom defeated veteran white male Democrats last year, Michael Capuano and Joseph Crowley. Of the 50 longest-serving House Democrats, two-thirds are white and about the same share are men. Insurgents are often female, often young and often nonwhite, all groups that are part of the Democrats\u2019 base strategy. \u201cI\u2019ve worked in Democratic politics for 30 years, and as long as I have been around, I have never seen the D.C.C.C. engage in a primary as an institution on behalf of an incumbent,\u201d said Ms. Pritchard, whose views are shared by a growing group of Democrats in and outside Congress. \u201cA lot of Democrats are terrified that what happened to Capuano and Crowley will happen to them and are looking for backup,\u201d she said. \u201cI actually thought this policy was a joke until I saw it written up, but they are enforcing it aggressively.\u201d Marie Newman came within two percentage points last year of defeating Representative Daniel Lipinski, an Illinois Democrat who is now in his eighth term and is one of the few in the caucus to oppose abortion rights. She is running again, but two consultants have backed out of her campaign, \u201cboth citing the D.C.C.C. blacklist issue as the reason,\u201d said Ben Hardin, Ms. Newman\u2019s campaign manager. Representative Diana DeGette, a Democrat who has served 12 terms in Colorado, is facing a primary challenge from Crisanta Duran, who was the first Latina speaker of the Colorado House of Representatives. \u201cIt is having a chilling effect on everyone\u2019s capacity to move forward,\u201d said Steve Welchert, a spokesman for Ms. Duran\u2019s campaign and a veteran Democratic consultant. Mr. Welchert said that one firm had rejected their business and that another firm said it was feeling pressure to do the same. \u201cIt certainly harms younger candidates,\u201d he said, calling the policy \u201cbullying.\u201d Suraj Patel, an adjunct professor at New York University and a former Obama administration staff member, got crushed in his campaign last year against  Representative Carolyn Maloney, a longtime incumbent in New York. He wants to try again, hoping for an even larger turnout among young voters than last time, when their numbers soared. But he already feels boxed out. \u201cI have been officially told by three vendors that they could not work with me,\u201d Mr. Patel said. In New Jersey, Zina Spezakis, a clean technology investor, is taking on Bill Pascrell, who was first elected in 1996. While she found that the old-guard firms were not interested in her business, newer firms have popped up to help. \u201cIt is a little maddening,\u201d she said. \u201cBut there are a whole sector of firms willing to work with you. They are reflective of the candidates \u2014 younger, more creative and more efficient with their money.\u201d The argument for electing Democratic challengers is generally built around the notion that new faces and more diverse voices ought to replace old-timers. Most lose \u2014 for every Ms. Ocasio-Cortez who knocks down the House, there are scores of challengers who barely make a dent in the front door. But in a year when women are once again expected to drive many races, an expanding group of Democrats outside Congress is critical of the D.C.C.C.\u2019s decision. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed in the policy and don\u2019t agree with it,\u201d said Stephanie Schriock, the president of Emily\u2019s List, which supports Democrats who favor abortion rights. \u201cWe frequently work closely with the D.C.C.C. and will continue to do so,\u201d she said. \u201cBut our top priority is electing pro-choice Democratic women, and sometimes that means being on a different side than the committees.\u201d Cole Leiter, a spokesman for the committee, defended the policy, pointing to the party\u2019s success in last year\u2019s midterm elections. \u201cThe D.C.C.C. is proud of its historic work, flipping 43 formerly Republican seats and electing the most diverse caucus in American history,\u201d he said. \u201cThe D.C.C.C. is already well into our work to fortify this newly won House majority and expand the battlefield further into districts that haven\u2019t had the opportunity to elect a Democrat in decades.\u201d Primary battles have always vexed both parties, because they are divisive and because they drain incumbents\u2019 coffers ahead of general election fights. But while Republicans have faced a spate of losses among incumbents during the Tea Party waves over the past decade, the committee that helps elect them to the House \u2014 the National Republican Campaign Committee \u2014 remains neutral in primary fights. The D.C.C.C. policy has caused significant tensions among House Democrats. Many incumbents largely welcome the policy, but newer and more liberal members \u2014 especially those who have been shunned by the committee in their own races \u2014 are furious. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez has encouraged donors to put their money elsewhere, and she has done her own online fund-raising for numerous candidates. \u201cMy recommendation, if you\u2019re a small-dollar donor: pause your donations to DCCC & give directly to swing candidates instead,\u201d she tweeted. Representative Jahana Hayes, Democrat of Connecticut, ran for an open seat last year, but she said the policy could inhibit candidates like her, the first African-American woman elected to Congress from her state. \u201cIf I waited my turn, I wouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is a gatekeeper mentality that sometimes can diminish new ideas.\u201d Disenchantment with the policy has moved beyond Washington. A group of college Democrats has organized a boycott of the committee, which has now extended to at least one city council. \u201cAs young Democrats we think this policy will silence our voices,\u201d said Hank Sparks, president of the Harvard College Democrats, which has collected 75 chapters in its boycott, largely symbolic since students are not big donors. Ms. Pritchard said the policy would have long-term implications for people who work in Democratic politics, too. \u201cI am taking a strong position on something that will change my life,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople\u2019s livelihoods are being threatened.\u201d",

      "author": "Sheryl Gay Stolberg",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the liberal freshman Democrat from New York who has made fighting for immigrants\u2019 rights a signature issue, on Tuesday described the Trump administration\u2019s border detention facilities as \u201cconcentration camps,\u201d provoking backlash from Republicans who said she was minimizing the Holocaust. \u201cThis administration has established concentration camps on the southern border of the United States for immigrants, where they are being brutalized with dehumanizing conditions and dying,\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez wrote on Twitter, amplifying comments she had made on her Instagram feed on Monday night. \u201cThis is not hyperbole. It is the conclusion of expert analysis,\u201d she added, citing an article in Esquire magazine that quoted a historian of the Holocaust who lectures at the University of Virginia. In the article, the historian, Waitman Wade Beorn, said, \u201cThings can be concentration camps without being Dachau or Auschwitz.\u201d But the invocation of Nazi imagery to describe the administration\u2019s handling of immigrants and refugees set off a furor in Washington. Although not all Nazi concentration camps were death camps \u2014 some were forced labor camps \u2014 Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s use of the phrase, which she said was intentional, opened the door for attacks from Republicans, led by Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the sharp-tongued chairwoman of the House Republican Conference. \u201cPlease @AOC do us all a favor and spend just a few minutes learning some actual history,\u201d Ms. Cheney wrote on Twitter. \u201c6 million Jews were exterminated in the Holocaust. You demean their memory and disgrace yourself with comments like this.\u201d Representative Lee Zeldin, Republican of New York, who is Jewish, called for Ms. Ocasio-Cortez to \u201cstop trying to draw these crayon parallels between POTUS & Hitler!\u201d But Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York and the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, chimed in to support Ms. Ocasio-Cortez. Mr. Nadler, who is Jewish, tweeted: \u201cOne of the lessons from the Holocaust is \u2018Never Again\u2019 - not only to mass murder, but also to the dehumanization of people, violations of basic rights, and assaults on our common morality. We fail to learn that lesson when we don\u2019t callout such inhumanity right in front of us.\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s comments come as debate over American policy toward Israel and how to respond to anti-Semitism is roiling Congress in general and the Democratic Party in particular. Democrats voted this year to condemn all forms of hatred, including anti-Semitism, after a charged debate over Representative Ilhan Omar, a freshman Democrat from Minnesota, who invoked what many said were anti-Semitic tropes in talking about supporters of Israel. Whether Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s remarks will generate widespread pushback in the Democratic caucus was not immediately clear on Tuesday; many lawmakers were still traveling back to Washington after a long weekend. J Street, the progressive pro-Israel advocacy group, defended the congresswoman. \u201cLike the vast majority of American Jews, J Street is outraged by the Trump administration\u2019s disgraceful, inhumane treatment of migrants and refugees \u2014 and supportive of members of Congress like Representative Ocasio-Cortez who are strongly challenging the president\u2019s hateful policies,\u201d the group said in a statement. \u201cThe legacy of the Holocaust absolutely compels us to act in defense of vulnerable and targeted minorities \u2014 and to stop their mistreatment before it grows even worse,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cInstead of policing terminology, we should be doing everything we can to shut down these camps and to aid the families who are imprisoned in them.\u201d But at least one Democrat, Representative Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey, who lost family members in the Holocaust, criticized Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s remarks. \u201cAs an American, I\u2019m deeply concerned about the treatment of children at our borders,\u201d Mr. Gottheimer said in a text. \u201cBut, make no mistake, the comparison is cruel and disrespectful to the six million who were murdered in the Holocaust, including members of my own family. Concentration camps were places where Jews and others were enslaved, tortured, and then sent to gas chambers to be murdered.\u201d The comments also set off intense debate over the meaning of the words \u201cconcentration camp\u201d and whether the term could be appropriately used to describe anything other than Nazi death camps. Politicians and public officials generally regard invoking Nazi comparisons as the third rail of politics; it is done at one\u2019s own peril. Sean Spicer, who served as Mr. Trump\u2019s first White House press secretary, was excoriated when he suggested that President Bashar al-Assad of Syria was guilty of acts worse than Hitler and referred to Nazi death camps as \u201cHolocaust centers.\u201d But Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, 29, is typically intentional about her word choice, as she herself made clear when she addressed her Instagram followers on Monday evening in one of her regular unscripted videos. \u201cI want to talk to the people that are concerned enough with humanity to say that \u2018Never Again\u2019 means something,\u201d she said, invoking a phrase Jews use when discussing the importance of remembering the Holocaust. \u201cThe fact that concentration camps are now an institutionalized practice in the home of the free is extraordinarily disturbing and we need to do something about it.\u201d She called Mr. Trump\u2019s administration \u201can authoritarian and fascist presidency,\u201d adding: \u201cI don\u2019t use those words lightly. I don\u2019t use those words to just throw bombs. I use that word because that is what an administration that creates concentration camps is. A presidency that creates concentration camps is fascist.\u201d The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines a concentration camp as \u201ca place where large numbers of people (such as prisoners of war, political prisoners, refugees or the members of an ethnic or religious minority) are detained or confined under armed guard \u2014 used especially in reference to camps created by the Nazis in World War II for the internment and persecution of Jews and other prisoners.\u201d",

      "author": "Zolan Kanno-Youngs",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Overcrowded, squalid conditions are more widespread at migrant centers along the southern border than initially revealed, the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s independent watchdog said Tuesday. Its report describes standing-room-only cells, children without showers and hot meals, and detainees clamoring desperately for release. The findings by the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Office of Inspector General were released as House Democrats detailed their own findings at migrant holding centers and pressed the agency to answer for the mistreatment not only of migrants but also of their own colleagues, who have been threatened on social media. [Read the report from inspector general\u2019s office.] In June, inspectors from the department visited five facilities in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas, and found children had few spare clothes and no laundry facilities. Many migrants were given only wet wipes to clean themselves and bologna sandwiches to eat, causing constipation and other health problems, according to the report. Children at two of the five facilities in the area were not given hot meals until inspectors arrived. Overcrowding was so severe that when the agency\u2019s internal inspectors visited some of the facilities, migrants banged on cells and pressed notes to windows begging for help. \u201cAt one facility, some single adults were held in standing-room-only conditions for a week, and at another, some single adults were held more than a month in overcrowded cells,\u201d according to the report, which built off an initial inquiry by the inspector general in May that described similar conditions in facilities in El Paso. The report fueled Democratic lawmakers\u2019 resolve to press for answers from the Customs and Border Protection agency even as they continued to fight among themselves over an emergency spending bill that passed last week without the strict conditions that liberals and Hispanic members had demanded. Their sense of urgency was stoked further after ProPublica unearthed a secret Facebook group for current and former Border Patrol agents that featured jokes about migrant deaths and threats to members of Congress. On Wednesday morning, Kevin K. McAleenan, the acting secretary at the Department of Homeland Security, cited \u201cdisturbing & inexcusable social media activity that allegedly includes active Border Patrol personnel.\u201d In a statement on Tuesday, Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the \u201cinspector general\u2019s report provides a shocking window into the dangerous and dehumanizing conditions that the Trump administration is inflicting on children and families at the border.\u201d \u201cThis report is even more troubling after the discovery of the vile, crude comments made on social media by some of those in C.B.P. responsible for caring for migrant families and children,\u201d she said. \u201cThe inhumanity at the border is a challenge to the conscience of America.\u201d After touring a facility in Clint, Tex., where a group of lawyers had reported that children had gone unfed and unwashed, Democratic lawmakers said they had met migrants who were not given fresh water and were forced to drink from toilets. In a series of tweets on Tuesday, one of the Democrats, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, who was the target of some of the more offensive posts in the Facebook group, described Customs and Border Protection as a \u201crogue agency.\u201d Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, demanded on Tuesday Mr. McAleenan, and the newly appointed acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, Mark Morgan, come to Capitol Hill to discuss the Facebook group and the allegations in the report. \u201cThere seems to be open contempt for the rule of law and for basic human decency,\u201d Mr. Cummings said. \u201cThe committee needs to hear directly from the heads of these agencies as soon as possible in light of the almost daily reports of abuse and defiance.\u201d The House Judiciary and Oversight Committees both announced hearings next week into the conditions at detention centers. According to the report, details of which were first reported by BuzzFeed News, 826 of the 2,669 children detained at the facilities were held longer than 72 hours, in violation of a federal court settlement and Customs and Border Protection policy. Senior managers raised security concerns at the facilities, calling the situation \u201ca ticking time bomb,\u201d according to the report. Images published in the report show crowds of migrants packed into cells pressing their hands onto the windows. One migrant held a cardboard sign up reading, \u201cHelp.\u201d Some migrants clogged their toilets with blankets and socks in order to be released from the crowded cells. When some refused to return, Border Patrol brought in a special operations team \u201cto use force if necessary.\u201d \u201cAdditionally, detainees have attempted to escape while removed from their cells during maintenance,\u201d according to the report. While senior Department of Homeland Security officials have for months sounded the alarm over a record number of Central American families crossing the southwestern border, officials in recent weeks have disputed the descriptions of the conditions of detained migrants. Mr. McAleenan last week described the allegations at the Clint facility as \u201cunsubstantiated\u201d and called it \u201cclean and well managed.\u201d But the government\u2019s own report backed up the Democrats\u2019 descriptions. The facilities were built for the short-term stay of adults expected to be quickly deported. Central American children, who under immigration law cannot be immediately deported back to their origin country, are supposed to be moved to facilities managed by the Department of Health and Human Services within 72 hours. Single adults are supposed to be moved to facilities built for longer-term detention managed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. \u201cThese are not facilities that are designed to hold people for more than three days,\u201d said Representative Will Hurd of Texas, the only Republican representing a border district. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be holding anybody in these facilities for more than that.\u201d But Department of Homeland Security officials have said other facilities are full as well. To deter migration to the border, the department recently threatened to start nationwide raids to deport undocumented families, which President Trump said will begin after July 4. An ICE spokesman also said on Tuesday that the agency was issuing fines of hundreds of thousands of dollars to unauthorized immigrants who refused to comply with deportation orders. The agency began sending out the notices, with fines up to $799 per day, in December. On Tuesday, NPR reported that one woman was sent a fine for nearly $500,000. Among border sectors, the Rio Grande Valley has seen some of the largest surges of migration, according to senior department officials. The agency has built tent camps in the area to hold hundreds of the asylum seekers and this year began flying unprocessed migrants to facilities with more space in San Diego. Last week, Customs and Border Protection gave reporters a rare tour of a detention facility in McAllen, Tex., where migrants of all ages were being held inside chain-link fences, lying on worn gym mats and snacking on sandwiches. Stacked on shelves inside \u201cla hielera,\u201d or the icebox, as migrants commonly call the facility for its frigid temperatures, were diapers, baby wipes, formulas and other materials the authorities use to care for the migrants. Two medical teams operate out of the facility, and screen the migrants when they arrive after being apprehended by Border Patrol agents. \u201cThis is kind of ground zero for us,\u201d said Carmen Qualia, the acting executive officer for law enforcement operational programs of the Border Patrol\u2019s Rio Grande Valley sector. But the inspector general\u2019s report questioned whether the department was doing enough for the children. At a news conference on Tuesday, doctors in Texas who care for children released from the facilities said they were surprised more had not died. At least six migrant children have died in federal custody or shortly after they were released since September. They described children having lifesaving medication taken away, or released with serious ailments but without any medical records from the time they were detained. One doctor related the story of a young mother who described how hard it was to keep her newborn baby warm while in custody. \u201cThis baby had been given a new onesie and given a plastic blanket, and despite her best efforts, her little newborn\u2019s fingers and toes were still blue,\u201d said Dr. Lisa Ayoub-Rodriguez, a pediatrician in El Paso. Robert E. Perez, the deputy commissioner for Customs and Border Protection, said he was \u201cvery confident\u201d his agents were providing fresh water, food and hygiene products to migrants in Border Patrol custody. His agents are overwhelmed, he said, because of a record number of families crossing the border, which has filled facilities built for short-term detention. \u201cWe take any and every allegation of misconduct incredibly seriously,\u201d Mr. Perez said on CNN. \u201cAnd there will be consequences to those who do not adhere to our standards of conduct.\u201d",

Monday\u2019s visit to the border by more than a dozen members of Congress \u2014 including Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and Representative Veronica Escobar of Texas \u2014 was a specific focus of some of the abuse on Facebook, ProPublica reported. One post used vulgar language to encourage agents to \u201churl a \u2018burrito\u2019\u201d at the two women. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez fired back at the group on Monday night in a series of tweets describing the visit. \u201cThese officers felt brazen in there,\u201d she said, pointing out that members of the congressional delegation were asked to surrender their phones before the visit. \u201cWhile mgmt was telling us it was a \u2018secure facility\u2019 where *members of Congress* had to check their phones, we caught officers trying to sneak photos, laughing.\u201d She added, referring to the Border Patrol\u2019s parent agency, Customs and Border Protection: \u201cCBP\u2019s \u2018good\u2019 behavior was toxic. Imagine how they treat the women trapped inside.\u201d The head of the Border Patrol, Carla Provost, said the posts on Facebook were \u201ccompletely inappropriate,\u201d adding that \u201cany employees found to have violated our standards of conduct will be held accountable.\u201d On Monday night, Customs and Border Protection said it was opening an investigation into the Facebook group. The ProPublica report further escalated the tense atmosphere the group of Democratic lawmakers found on their scheduled tour of facilities in Clint and El Paso. \u201cIt feels like a jail,\u201d said Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III of Massachusetts, \u201cand they\u2019re treating them like they\u2019re in jail.\u201d \u201cThis entire system is broken,\u201d he said. \u201cThey deserve better than this, and our country deserves better than this.\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said in a tweet that Customs and Border Protection \u201cdid a lot of \u2018cleaning up\u2019 before we arrived.\u201d She said women told her they had gone 15 days without a shower and were allowed to start bathing only four days ago, after the congressional visit was announced. Some women, she said, told her they were forced to drink out of the toilet when the faucet in their cell broke. A Customs and Border Protection official declined to comment on the accusation. At a news conference on Monday afternoon, the lawmakers\u2019 emotional descriptions were almost completely drowned out by vulgar and racist heckling from a handful of protesters, some carrying Trump 2020 banners and posters calling for tougher border security, deportation and the construction of a wall at the southwestern border. \u201cBunch of knuckleheads,\u201d one man yelled as the lawmakers tried to describe what they had seen at a Border Patrol station in El Paso and a migrant facility in Clint. \u201cBreak out the onions,\u201d a woman cried, mocking how some of the Democrats grew visibly emotional in front of the microphones. \u201cWe don\u2019t want Muslims here,\u201d another yelled, minutes before Representative Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, one of the first Muslim women elected to Congress, vowed to \u201coutlove your hate.\u201d \u201cYou can all scream at me,\u201d she said. \u201cI will never stop speaking truth to power.\u201d Immigration activists added to the tumult as they tried to combat the insults and heckles with support for the lawmakers. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus had organized the day trip to the Texas border after reports of children being held in squalor in the Clint facility, accusations Trump administration officials have vigorously denied. The group also visited a facility affiliated with the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Office of Refugee Resettlement. But lawmakers emerged from the Border Patrol facilities describing living conditions unfit to hold adults or children, with Cuban, Honduran and Guatemalan women \u2014 including grandmothers and a young pregnant woman \u2014 sharing cells, some sobbing from fear of retribution from the guards for sharing their stories. Representative Madeleine Dean of Pennsylvania said in an interview that she was initially scolded by an official for miming an air hug to a migrant child. Lawmakers said they had been told not to speak to the migrants. But ultimately, the group spoke with a number of migrants at the facilities. In images and videos taken by Representative Joaquin Castro of Texas, the head of the Hispanic caucus, on a device smuggled into the facility, a group of women, some with tear-stained cheeks, can be seen huddling in blue sleeping bags. They told lawmakers that they did not have access to medication. Officials denied those accusations. When she asked one woman what brought her to the facility, Ms. Dean recalled in an interview, \u201cThe woman said: \u2018I crossed that damn river. I wanted to come to America. That\u2019s my offense.\u2019\u201d Most of the Democratic lawmakers on the trip to Texas voted against a $4.6 billion humanitarian aid package last month, citing concerns about sending more federal money to the border without strict oversight provisions. The visit appeared to harden their resolve. \u201cAfter I forced myself into a cell w/ women&began speaking to them, one of them described their treatment at the hands of officers as \u2018psychological warfare,\u2019\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez tweeted on Monday. \u201cTell me what about that is due to a \u2018lack of funding?\u2019\u201d President Trump, shortly after the lawmakers wrapped up their news conference, signed the aid package into law. \u201cI don\u2019t know what they\u2019re saying about the members of Congress,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters on Monday. \u201cI know that the Border Patrol is not happy with the Democrats in Congress.\u201d",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Top officials in the agency overseeing border security condemned a secret Facebook group for current and former Border Patrol agents that featured jokes about migrant deaths, obscene images of Hispanic lawmakers and threats to members of Congress as the lawmakers themselves on Tuesday amplified their criticism of the agency. Carla Provost, the chief of the Border Patrol, sent an email to her agents describing the posts in the group as \u201chighly inappropriate and offensive.\u201d The Customs and Border Protection agency\u2019s Office of Professional Responsibility and the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s inspector general began an independent investigation into the posts, Ms. Provost said. \u201cThe men and women of the U.S. Border Patrol are under immense pressure every day as you manage the crisis on our border,\u201d Ms. Provost said in the letter, which the Department of Homeland Security made available on Monday night. \u201cBut let me be clear: There is absolutely no excuse for this kind of inappropriate behavior \u2014 on or off duty, publicly or privately.\u201d [Related: Inside the migrant detention center in Clint, Texas.] She said any agents identified as writing the posts would be held accountable. ProPublica reported the existence of the secret Facebook group just as Democratic lawmakers toured Border Patrol facilities in Clint and El Paso, Tex., on Monday. In a series of tweets on Tuesday, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat who was a target of some of the most offensive posts in the group, described Customs and Border Protection as a \u201crogue agency.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t understate how disturbing it was that CBP officers were openly disrespectful of the Congressional tour,\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez tweeted. \u201cIf officers felt comfortable violating agreements in front of their *own* management & superiors, that tells us the agency has lost all control of their own officers.\u201d She also pointed the finger at members of Congress who signed off on the Senate\u2019s $4.6 billion humanitarian aid package for the border, which exposed division in the Democratic Party. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and other more liberal Democrats wanted the bill to include stronger protections for migrant children. \u201cThey just wrote a multi-billion dollar blank check for misconduct,\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said. That \u201cblank check\u201d is forming the backdrop for the escalating battle on the border. House Democrats had wanted to attach strict conditions on the humanitarian funding being rushed to the Departments of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services. Under a House bill, facilities that housed unaccompanied children would have had a slightly shorter time frame \u2014 12 months instead of 14 \u2014 to meet existing legal standards for healthy, sanitary and humane conditions than under the measure President Trump signed into law. They also would have had to allow oversight visits from members of Congress without warning, and the Department of Health and Human Services would have had to report a child\u2019s death in its custody to Congress within 24 hours. Liberal Democrats in the House also wanted to ban for-profit companies from running migrant shelters and scrap funding for the United States Marshals specifically geared toward referring people who entered or re-entered the country illegally for criminal prosecution. They also wanted stronger prohibitions against sharing the immigration records of people who come forward to take custody of unaccompanied migrant children. But facing divisions within her party, Speaker Nancy Pelosi gave up on those provisions last week and passed the less restrictive Senate measure, infuriating many of the House Democrats who toured the border facilities this week. At a news conference after the tour on Monday, the lawmakers detailed horrid conditions for the migrants, including in a Border Patrol facility in Clint that has become the subject of public backlash in recent weeks after a team of lawyers who spoke to migrants at the facility reported that children had gone unfed and unwashed while detained. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said that she had spoken to one migrant who had been forced to drink water out of a toilet, an assertion backed by two other House Democrats, Judy Chu of California and Joaquin Castro of Texas. Mr. Castro released footage from inside the Clint facility that he said in a tweet \u201ccaptures what it\u2019s like for women in CBP custody to share a cramped cell \u2014 some held for 50 days \u2014 for them to be denied showers for up to 15 days and life-saving medication.\u201d Kellyanne Conway, the counselor to the president, denounced \u201cAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez going down to one of these facilities and making this outrageous claim that a woman\u2019s drinking from a toilet, which everybody who has control over that facility, or control for the Border Patrol has said that\u2019s not true.\u201d Last week the acting secretary of homeland security described allegations that children in the Clint facility had gone unfed and unwashed as \u201cunsubstantiated\u201d and the facility itself as \u201cclean and well managed.\u201d Robert E. Perez, the deputy commissioner for Customs and Border Protection, said he was \u201cvery confident\u201d his agents were providing fresh water, food and hygiene products to migrants in Border Patrol custody. His agents are overwhelmed, he said, because of a record number of families crossing the border, which has filled facilities built for short-term detention. \u201cWe take any and every allegation of misconduct incredibly seriously,\u201d Mr. Perez said on CNN. \u201cAnd there will be consequences to those who do not adhere to our standards of conduct.\u201d",

      "author": "Julie Hirschfeld Davis",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Speaker Nancy Pelosi said they have no following in Congress. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York shot back that she and three of her fellow liberal freshmen, darlings of the left known collectively as \u201cthe squad,\u201d are wielding the real power in the party. Six months into the new House Democratic majority, long-simmering tensions between the speaker and the squad \u2014 Representatives Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ayanna S. Pressley of Massachusetts \u2014 have boiled over in the most public of ways, setting off a flurry of criticism of Ms. Pelosi among liberal activists and reinvigorating a debate within the party about how best to stand up to President Trump. The fire was lit by a $4.6 billion border aid package passed by Congress that the quartet argued had empowered Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown. But the forest already was a tinder box, dried by the monthslong debate over impeachment, earlier dust-ups with Ms. Omar and Ms. Tlaib and over Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Green New Deal, and looming debates over a $15-an-hour minimum wage bill and funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The squabble is all the more notable because it pits Ms. Pelosi, the liberal San Francisco congresswoman who is the most powerful elected woman in American history, against a group of progressive Democratic women of color who have broken barriers of their own as part of the most diverse class ever to serve in the House. \u201cThis is an inevitable tension between a few progressives with one priority, which is their ideology, and a speaker with many priorities, including preserving the majority in the House, electing a Democratic president against Trump, and responding to the consensus of her caucus,\u201d said Steve Israel, a Democrat and former representative of New York. \u201cTo the extent that it distracts from Donald Trump and becomes a circular firing squad among Democrats, it can be lethal.\u201d Others see an old guard defending itself against powerful young voices demanding change. \u201cThose freshman members are breaking through, and they\u2019re building a movement, and the more power that movement gains, the more persuasive they will be to Pelosi,\u201d said Brian Fallon, a former spokesman for Senator Chuck Schumer and Hillary Clinton. The contretemps began when Maureen Dowd, the New York Times columnist, asked Ms. Pelosi about the squad\u2019s fury over the border aid package. The speaker noted that the group had failed to persuade any other Democrats to join them last month in voting against the House\u2019s version of the bill, which placed restrictions on how the administration could spend the money and demanded standards of care at migrant detention centers. \u201cAll these people have their public whatever and their Twitter world,\u201d Ms. Pelosi told Ms. Dowd in an interview published over the weekend by The Times. \u201cBut they didn\u2019t have any following. They\u2019re four people, and that\u2019s how many votes they got.\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, the Queens congresswoman who upset a 20-year Democratic incumbent in a primary and who has carved out a reputation as an outspoken and social-media-savvy firebrand in the halls of Congress, responded tartly in a string of Twitter posts \u2014 a public show of defiance to the leader of her party 50 years her senior. \u201cThat public \u2018whatever\u2019 is called public sentiment,\u201d she wrote to her more than 4.7 million followers in a message that was recirculated more than 10,000 times and \u201cliked\u201d by more than 65,000 accounts. \u201cAnd wielding the power to shift it is how we actually achieve meaningful change in this country.\u201d Ms. Omar chimed in with a tweet of solidarity. \u201cPatetico!\u201d she wrote on her personal Twitter account, with more than one million followers. \u201cYou know they\u2019re just salty about WHO is wielding the power to shift \u2018public sentiment\u2019 these days, sis. Sorry not sorry.\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s chief of staff, Saikat Chakrabarti, went much further, arguing in a series of tweets that his boss and her first-term colleagues were better at leading than Ms. Pelosi was, that Democratic leaders were not willing to fight for their principles, and that the speaker had failed to deliver any Democratic victories while shrinking from impeachment proceedings against Mr. Trump. \u201cPelosi claims we can\u2019t focus on impeachment because it\u2019s a distraction from kitchen table issues,\u201d Mr. Chakrabarti wrote. \u201cBut I\u2019d challenge you to find voters that can name a single thing House Democrats have done for their kitchen table this year. What is this legislative mastermind doing?\u201d The back and forth has less to do with ideological differences between Ms. Pelosi and the young crop of progressives than their divergent styles and agendas. Ms. Pelosi, whose legislative triumphs include muscling the Affordable Care Act through the House in 2010, has focused on using the House Democrats\u2019 power to challenge Mr. Trump by advancing legislation that appeals to the broadest possible swath of Democrats, including the more than two dozen moderate lawmakers elected in districts carried by the president in 2016. She has kept the fractious caucus united on measures addressing health care, gun safety, election reforms and immigration, even as divisions persist over whether to impeach Mr. Trump, a step she has so far refused to endorse. \u201cLook, we wouldn\u2019t have an A.C.A., we wouldn\u2019t have all of the progressive policies that we have if it weren\u2019t for her, and she has molded a caucus that, especially in these last several months, made unbelievable strides in terms of public policy,\u201d said Representative Rosa DeLauro, Democrat of Connecticut, a close ally of the speaker. \u201cWe have these young women who have new and great energy and ideas, and I welcome all of that, but the idea that there is some outcry against the speaker of the House? They speak for themselves, but the caucus is squarely behind Nancy Pelosi.\u201d The speaker is also giving voice to an undercurrent of resentment among Democratic lawmakers toward Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and her group, whom they see as using their megaphones to sow intraparty divisions and burnish their own brands without achieving any results for Democrats. On Tuesday, some senior Democrats were working behind the scenes to try to smooth over those raw feelings, according to one lawmaker involved in the effort, recognizing that Ms. Pelosi\u2019s dismissive comments about the squad\u2019s political celebrity could do lasting damage. But Ms. Pelosi insists she was not trying to take anything away from the group. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t dismissive; it was a statement of fact,\u201d Ms. Pelosi told a reporter in San Francisco on Monday, saying while most House Democrats had \u201cvoted to protect the children\u201d by supporting the House\u2019s humanitarian aid bill, the squad had chosen not to. \u201cThey were four who argued against the bill, and they were the only four who voted against the bill. All I said was nobody followed their lead.\u201d \u201cThey have a following in the public,\u201d Ms. Pelosi added. \u201cI\u2019m just talking about in the Congress.\u201d The foursome has helped to redefine their party\u2019s message, pushing multi-trillion-dollar ideas like the Green New Deal, Medicare for all, and tuition-free college that have drawn broad rhetorical support, including from Democratic presidential candidates. But they have yet to translate their vision into concrete legislative achievement. The squad and its allies argue that they are tapping into the real energy in the Democratic base with their uncompromising and unapologetic stances. \u201cRepresenting the movement that actually helped to put everyone in Congress into office and give Pelosi her gavel is a critical role, and they\u2019ve been at the forefront of pushing the boundaries of what is possible in Congress,\u201d said Leah Greenberg, the executive director of Indivisible, a progressive advocacy group. Liberal activists tried to use the speaker\u2019s comments to stoke outrage \u2014 and to raise money to mount primaries against incumbent Democrats they deem insufficiently liberal. \u201cAOC and The Squad have changed the entire national debate,\u201d said an email rehashing the spat from the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which offered a colorful \u201cI STAND WITH AOC\u201d sticker to anyone who donated to their work \u201celecting more AOC\u2019s to Congress.\u201d Mr. Fallon, now the executive director of the grass-roots progressive group Demand Justice, said Ms. Ocasio-Cortez has demonstrated a unique ability to grab the public spotlight for liberal candidates and causes, as she did last week when she visited a migrant detention center in Texas. But Ms. Pelosi has an entirely different mandate, he argued, one that her recent comments may have been designed to subtly convey. \u201cI think more than anything it\u2019s a challenge to this ascending wing of the party, that if they actually want to move beyond being the protest wing and have leadership follow their strategy, that they need to grow their base of support and leave her with no option,\u201d he said. On Tuesday, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said she was baffled by Ms. Pelosi\u2019s decision to take issue with her and her three young colleagues, adding that the speaker had repeatedly singled them out for criticism. \u201cI would understand why you\u2019d want to put an arm\u2019s distance between more progressive members of the caucus and more moderate members of the caucus \u2014 I think that\u2019s fine \u2014 but it\u2019s explicitly the four of us,\u201d she said. \u201cI was elected here to do a job,\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez added. \u201cBut I also respect the fact that she has to do hers.\u201d",

      "author": "Peter Baker",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump woke up on Sunday morning, gazed out at the nation he leads, saw the dry kindling of race relations and decided to throw a match on it. It was not the first time, nor is it likely to be the last. He has a pretty large carton of matches and a ready supply of kerosene. His Twitter harangue goading Democratic congresswomen of color to \u201cgo back\u201d to the country they came from, even though most of them were actually born in the United States, shocked many. But it should have surprised few who have watched the way he has governed a multicultural, multiracial country the last two and a half years. When it comes to race, Mr. Trump plays with fire like no other president in a century. While others who occupied the White House at times skirted close to or even over the line, finding ways to appeal to the resentments of white Americans with subtle and not-so-subtle appeals, none of them in modern times fanned the flames as overtly, relentlessly and even eagerly as Mr. Trump. His attack on the Democratic congresswomen came on the same day his administration was threatening mass roundups of immigrants living in the country illegally. And it came just days after he hosted some of the most incendiary right-wing voices on the internet at the White House and vowed to find another way to count citizens separately from noncitizens despite a Supreme Court ruling that blocked him from adding a question to the once-a-decade census. [Mr. Trump lashed out again Monday, accusing the women of themselves using \u201cracist hatred.\u201d] His assumption that the House Democrats must have been born in another country \u2014 or that they did not belong here if they were \u2014 fits an us-against-them political strategy that has been at the heart of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency from the start. Heading into next year\u2019s election, he appears to be drawing a deep line between the white, native-born America of his memory and the ethnically diverse, increasingly foreign-born country he is presiding over, challenging voters in 2020 to declare which side of that line they are on. \u201cIn many ways, this is the most insidious kind of racial demagoguery,\u201d said Douglas A. Blackmon, the author of \u201cSlavery by Another Name,\u201d a Pulitzer Prize-winning history of racial servitude in America between the Civil War and World War II. \u201cThe president has moved beyond invoking the obvious racial slanders of 50 years ago \u2014 clich\u00e9s like black neighborhoods \u2018on fire\u2019 \u2014 and is now invoking the white supremacist mentality of the early 1900s, when anyone who looked \u2018not white\u2019 could be labeled as unwelcome in America.\u201d Mr. Trump ritually denies any racial animus or motivations. His fight against illegal immigration, he says, is only about securing the border and protecting the country. He regularly boasts that unemployment among Hispanics and African-Americans has hit record lows. Last week he thanked Robert L. Johnson, the founder of Black Entertainment Television, for crediting his stewardship of the economy. \u201cI am the least racist person you have ever met,\u201d he has said more than once. But he does not go out of his way to avoid looking like he is, and his string of Twitter posts on Sunday left his own advisers unable or unwilling to defend him. None of six spokespeople for the White House or his campaign initially responded to requests for comment. One of the only administration officials who was already booked for the Sunday talk shows, Mark Morgan, the acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, made clear he wanted no part of it. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to ask the president what he means by those specific tweets,\u201d he said on \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on CBS. Republican lawmakers, by and large, did not rush to the president\u2019s side on Sunday either, but neither did they jump forward to denounce him. Deeply uncomfortable as many Republicans are with Mr. Trump\u2019s racially infused politics, they worry about offending the base voters who cheer on the president as a truth-teller taking on the tyranny of political correctness. Only in the evening did Mr. Trump respond to the furor, saying that Democrats were standing up for colleagues who \u201cspeak so badly of our Country\u201d and \u201cwhenever confronted\u201d call adversaries \u201cRACIST.\u201d At that point, Tim Murtaugh, a campaign spokesman for Mr. Trump, responded to a request for comment, saying, \u201cThe president pointed out that many Democrats say terrible things about this country, which in reality is the greatest nation on Earth.\u201d He did not explain why Mr. Trump told American-born lawmakers to \u201cgo back\u201d to countries they were not from. Other presidents have played racial politics or indulged in stereotypes. Secret tapes of Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard M. Nixon show them routinely making virulently racist statements behind closed doors. Mr. Nixon\u2019s Southern strategy was said to be aimed at disenchanted whites. Ronald Reagan was accused of coded racial appeals for talking so much about \u201cwelfare queens.\u201d George Bush and his supporters highlighted the case of a furloughed African-American murderer named Willie Horton. Bill Clinton was accused of a racial play for criticizing a black hip-hop star. But there were limits, even a generation ago, and most modern presidents preached racial unity over division. Mr. Johnson, of course, pushed through the most sweeping civil rights legislation in American history. Mr. Bush signed a civil-rights bill and denounced David Duke, the Ku Klux Klan leader, when he ran for governor of Louisiana as a Republican. His son, George W. Bush, made a point of visiting a mosque just days after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, to emphasize that America was not at war with Muslims. Barack Obama invited an African-American Harvard professor and the white police officer who mistakenly arrested him for a \u201cbeer summit.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s history on race has been well documented, from his days as a developer settling a Justice Department lawsuit over discrimination in renting apartments to his public agitation during the Central Park Five case in New York. Jack O\u2019Donnell, the former president of Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, later wrote that Mr. Trump openly disparaged others based on race, complaining, for example, that he did not want black men managing his money. \u201cTrump has not only always been a racist, but anyone around him who denies it, is lying,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Donnell said on Sunday. \u201cDonald Trump makes racist comments all the time. Once you know him, he speaks his mind about race very openly.\u201d Mr. Trump, he said, regularly trafficked in racial stereotypes \u2014 Jews were good with money, blacks were lazy, Puerto Ricans dressed badly. \u201cWhite people are Americans to Trump; everyone else is from somewhere else,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Donnell said. \u201cHe simply denies the reality of how we all immigrated to the United States.\u201d Mr. Trump propelled his way to the White House in part by promoting the false \u201cbirther\u201d conspiracy theory that Mr. Obama was actually born in Africa, not Hawaii. He opened his presidential bid in 2015 with an attack on Mexican \u201crapists\u201d coming across the border (although \u201csome, I assume, are good people\u201d) and later called for a ban on all Muslims entering the United States. He said an American-born judge of Mexican heritage could not be fair to him because of his ethnic background. As president, he complained during meetings that became public that Haitian immigrants \u201call have AIDS\u201d and said African visitors would never \u201cgo back to their huts.\u201d He disparaged Haiti and some African nations with a vulgarity and said instead of immigrants from there, the United States should accept more from Norway. He said there were \u201cvery fine people on both sides\u201d of a rally to save a Confederate monument that turned deadly in Charlottesville, Va., although he also condemned the neo-Nazis there. He is only saying what others believe but are too afraid to say, he insists. And each time the flames roar and Mr. Trump tosses a little more accelerant on top. The fire may be hot, but that\u2019s the way he likes it.",

      "author": "Julie Hirschfeld Davis",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Speaker Nancy Pelosi, working to restore comity after her dispute with four liberal freshmen burst into the open, made an extraordinary closed-door plea for Democratic unity on Wednesday and sharply rebuked those who have made personal attacks against fellow Democrats. In fiery remarks during the weekly morning meeting of the House Democratic Caucus, Ms. Pelosi defended her decision last month to push through an emergency border aid package that many progressives said lacked sufficient restrictions on the Trump administration. She argued that Democrats should train their ire on Republicans rather than pursuing a family feud that she said only played into the other party\u2019s hands. Without naming her, Ms. Pelosi appeared to single out Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, who has taken to Twitter to criticize the speaker and whose chief of staff has in recent weeks used the social media platform to question the speaker\u2019s leadership and suggest that centrist Democrats were racist. \u201cYou got a complaint? You come and talk to me about it,\u201d she told Democrats, according to two people in the room who described her remarks on the condition of anonymity. \u201cBut do not tweet about our members and expect us to think that that is just O.K.\u201d The speech, which attendees said drew a standing ovation from lawmakers in the room, was a notable moment for Ms. Pelosi and House Democrats who are grappling in real time with how to best use their fractious majority, and whose ties have been tested and strained in debates over impeachment, immigration, climate change and health care policy. As Ms. Pelosi spoke, Democrats were toiling to reach a consensus on an extensive defense policy measure, which has drawn skepticism from liberal lawmakers who want to include additional conditions on the president\u2019s powers to take unilateral military action and limit his power to keep troops at the southwestern border. The divides have been dramatized in recent days after Ms. Pelosi gave an interview questioning the legislative clout of Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and three other first-term lawmakers who make up what has come to be known as \u201cthe squad\u201d \u2014 Representatives Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Ayanna S. Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan. The New York congresswoman then struck back by suggesting that they, not the speaker, were the true leaders in the Democratic Party. Saikat Chakrabarti, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s chief of staff, added fuel to the fire with a series of tweets criticizing the speaker, a remarkable breach of protocol for an unelected congressional aide. Late last month, he deleted a tweet comparing Democratic moderates who backed a less-restrictive humanitarian aid bill to segregationists, calling them the \u201cNew Southern Democrats,\u201d and adding, \u201cThey certainly seem hell bent to do to black and brown people today what the old Southern Democrats did in the 40s.\u201d As Ms. Pelosi emerged from the meeting on Wednesday, she did not back down from the spat or the comments that helped to fuel it. \u201cI have no regrets about anything,\u201d she told reporters. \u201cRegrets is not what I do.\u201d Both Ms. Pelosi and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez have said the argument is not about them individually or any personal animosity that exists between them \u2014 they have not had a one-on-one conversation since January \u2014 but about the constituencies they represent. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez says she took offense at the speaker\u2019s remarks because they implied that her constituents, and members of the broader progressive movement who share her views, are irrelevant. \u201cIt\u2019s not about four people,\u201d she said in an interview on Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s about the millions of people that we were elected to represent. And the idea that we can just dismiss people from the Bronx because they\u2019re from the Bronx is, I think, counter to who we are as a party.\u201d Ms. Pelosi insisted she did not mind being a lightning rod for criticism, but she wanted to protect the more moderate Democrats in the Blue Dog Coalition and the New Democrat Coalition, many of whom represent Republican-leaning districts. Those members are constantly faced with the possibility that a vote they cast could harm their chances, and the party\u2019s chances, of holding the House, she said. \u201cEvery day some of our members have to fight the fight for their re-election,\u201d she said, according to one of the attendees who described her comments. \u201cYou make me the target, but don\u2019t make our Blue Dogs and our New Dems the target in all of this, because we have important fish to fry.\u201d The conflicts are unlikely to dissipate soon. Many Democrats are privately frustrated with Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s tactics, while others concede privately that Ms. Pelosi has made matters worse by appearing to dismiss her and the squad. \u201cIt\u2019s just a strange and bizarre thing, because leadership has never registered any problem with us privately, internally,\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said on Tuesday, before the speaker\u2019s closed-door remarks. \u201cWe\u2019ve never been pulled aside. No one\u2019s ever had a conversation, never really had a one-on-one on any of these kinds of issues.\u201d On Wednesday, Ms. Pelosi changed all that in front of the entire Democratic Caucus. \u201cSome of you are here to make a beautiful p\u00e2t\u00e9,\u201d she told the group. \u201cBut we\u2019re making sausage most of the time.\u201d",

      "content": " Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the popular freshman Democrat from New York who is trying to use her star power to move the Democratic Party to the left, will headline a rally next week in Washington in favor of the Green New Deal, as she seeks to shore up support for the expansive climate legislation that has been met with skepticism by members of both parties. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, a co-sponsor of the Green New Deal, has long aligned herself with Sunrise Movement, the collection of young, hard-charging activists who are pressuring Democrats nationwide to take bolder actions to address climate change after years of what they see as an inadequate response. The May 13 rally at Howard University, the final stop on the group\u2019s nationwide \u201cGreen New Deal Tour,\u201d will make the case for the bill in the backyard of Capitol Hill, where party establishment figures such as Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, and Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, have been more wary of their party\u2019s progressive flank than many in their rank-and-file. \u201cFrom fire-scarred California to areas of the plains devastated by flooding, people are hungry for a big vision to transform our economy in line with science and justice demands,\u201d said Varshini Prakash, a co-founder of Sunrise Movement. \u201cI\u2019m thrilled to be joining Representative Ocasio-Cortez to close out the tour and lay out what\u2019s next in the Green New Deal campaign.\u201d Shortly after Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s election in November, she joined Sunrise Movement protesters in Ms. Pelosi\u2019s office, helping to raise the organization\u2019s national profile. During other stops on the group\u2019s tour, a video has played in which Ms. Ocasio-Cortez describes her vision of the coming decade, which includes a transition to a green economy and other items on the liberal wish list, like \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d a federal jobs guarantee and publicly funded elections. The Green New Deal aims to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to avoid the worst consequences of climate change, but it also seeks to address problems such as economic inequality and racial injustice by prioritizing historically disenfranchised communities. Critics say the legislation is too ambitious and has dim political prospects in a Congress where Republicans control the Senate. \u201cWe\u2019ve been clear since our campaign started \u2014 the Democratic Party needs to lay out a clear and bold vision for America,\u201d said Corbin Trent, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s spokesman. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not only the best path for our planet \u2014 but it\u2019s the best path strategically and electorally to take the Senate and White House.\u201d The rally comes at a critical time for Sunrise Movement and its allied organizations, which are trying to use the current lack of a clear leader in the national Democratic Party as an opportunity to push for progressive causes. The Green New Deal had been a major talking point in the Democratic presidential primary, but the conversation has lurched back toward the center in recent weeks, particularly with the entry of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who remains the race\u2019s pacesetter in terms of early fund-raising and polling. While Mr. Biden has not taken an official stand on the Green New Deal, his surrogates have repeatedly dismissed the idea, and said the better electoral strategy for Democrats would be a clear focus on reversing the presidency of Mr. Trump, not embracing new and controversial policies. But recently in South Carolina, in a sign of the grass-roots pressure Mr. Biden may face, he was asked at a rally if he would pledge not to accept donations from the fossil fuel industry. Mr. Biden said that he would, and that he had long supported the idea of publicly funded elections. Former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke, who is also running for president, recently took the same pledge Mr. Biden said he supported, after repeated pressure from activists including members of Sunrise Movement. Mr. O\u2019Rourke had previously received donations from oil and gas executives. \u201cWe don\u2019t want there to be any real or perceived conflicts of interests,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke said in his video announcing he had signed the pledge. He also singled out youth activists for helping push him on the issue. \u201cThank you for your advocacy and leadership.\u201d",

      "author": "Peter Baker",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 On the night that he conceded defeat in 1992 after the most successful independent presidential campaign of the last century, Ross Perot made it clear that he was not done shaking up the established order. \u201cBelieve me,\u201d he declared, \u201cthe system needs some shocks.\u201d So perhaps it was only fitting that on the same week that Mr. Perot died nearly 27 years later, both of the two major political parties were being rattled by the aftershocks of the earthquake that his campaign represented. President Trump was busy quarreling with former Speaker Paul D. Ryan while the current speaker, Nancy Pelosi, was bickering with first-year House Democrats. In both cases, those who represented the institutional order, Mr. Ryan and Ms. Pelosi, found themselves at odds with rabble-rousers within their own parties agitating for change from outside the traditional system through the power of social media. This was not a week that showcased the competition between the parties but within them. The stress fractures that Mr. Perot identified a generation ago are tearing at the foundations of the Republican and Democratic Parties. \u201cThis really is the crackup,\u201d said Rahm Emanuel, the Democratic former Chicago mayor, congressman and White House chief of staff. \u201cUsually fights are Democrats versus Republicans, one end of Pennsylvania Avenue versus the other, or the left versus the right. Today\u2019s squabbles are internal between the establishment versus the people that are storming the barricades.\u201d Mr. Emanuel saw up close Mr. Perot\u2019s campaign in 1992 (and then again in 1996) as an aide to Bill Clinton, and today he identifies that moment as \u201cthe beginning point of the crackup of the parties.\u201d In the years since, the Bushes and Clintons have given way to Twitter-armed outsiders like Mr. Trump and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and \u201cthe squad\u201d of her fellow Democratic insurgents in Congress. [Ross Perot, a brash Texas billionaire who ran for president, dies at 89.] The difference is that Mr. Trump successfully staged a hostile takeover of the Republican Party in 2016 and has since brought much of its old establishment to heel, driving the likes of Mr. Ryan out the door or into hiding. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and her compatriots have not taken over the Democratic Party, but they are driving the conversation within it to a degree that few first-year House members have ever done, thanks to their online armies of like-minded disrupters tired of what they see as the corrupt status quo. Mr. Trump\u2019s dust-up with Mr. Ryan this week originated with the publication of \u201cAmerican Carnage,\u201d a new book on the Republican civil war by Tim Alberta, the chief political correspondent for Politico Magazine. In the book, Mr. Ryan, who stepped down as speaker in January, described his frustrations trying to deal with Mr. Trump, who, he said, \u201cdidn\u2019t know anything about government.\u201d As Mr. Ryan put it, \u201cI wanted to scold him all the time.\u201d Mr. Trump, the first president in American history who arrived in Washington without a single day of government or military experience but with tens of millions of followers on Twitter eager for him to break up the system, characteristically fired back at Mr. Ryan. In late-night tweets from the White House, Mr. Trump dismissed the former speaker as \u201ca long running lame duck failure\u201d whose \u201crecord of achievement was atrocious.\u201d The flare-up between Ms. Pelosi and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and her allies, Representatives Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ayanna S. Pressley of Massachusetts, in some ways echoed those themes. In an interview with the New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd, Ms. Pelosi complained that the upstarts did not understand how government works, dismissing their digital following as \u201ctheir public whatever.\u201d They in turn complained that Ms. Pelosi\u2019s record of achievement was inadequate because she was too willing to compromise rather than confront Republicans on issues like the migrant crisis at the border. There is, of course, no little irony that Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Ryan are now the beleaguered defenders of the old order, given that both of them were once seen as champions of the ideological extremes of their parties \u2014 she as a radical San Francisco leftist, he as a Medicare-destroying right winger. But they both came up within the system that is now under pressure from impatient newcomers who see no virtue in spending years in the backbenches waiting for their turn when they can be empowered by Twitter to wield influence in ways that would have been unthinkable in the past. \u201cBecause of social media and because people can be their own stars, they don\u2019t need to work through leadership or through hierarchy,\u201d said Representative Josh Gottheimer, Democrat of New Jersey and a leader of the Problem Solvers Caucus, a bipartisan group seeking to find consensus in a House where that is a dirty word. \u201cThey work outside in. That is a huge challenge because technology allows it.\u201d The outsiders are, in their own ways, tapping into the same disenchantment with the two-party system that Mr. Perot did. When he attracted 19 percent of the vote in 1992 against Mr. Clinton and President George Bush, it was the most any independent presidential candidate had generated since Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s unsuccessful comeback bid in 1912 and the most any independent candidate who had not previously served as president had received since the advent of the two current parties just before the Civil War. Since then, even more Americans have chosen to dissociate from the two parties. As recently as July 2004, only 27 percent of Americans called themselves independent in Gallup polling; today, 15 years later, 46 percent do. Most of those still vote reliably for one party or the other, so they are not truly swing voters who bounce back and forth depending on the year and the candidate. But they are sufficiently turned off enough by the parties not to want a D or an R next to their names. In 2003, 56 percent of Americans interviewed by Gallup said the two political parties did an adequate job. By last year, 57 percent said a third major party was needed. Younger Americans feel that even more strongly; 71 percent in an NBC/GenForward poll in 2017 said that they wanted a third party. Representative Justin Amash of Michigan, who supports impeaching Mr. Trump, reflected that when he left the Republican Party on the Fourth of July. \u201cThe two-party system has evolved into an existential threat to American principles and institutions,\u201d he wrote in The Washington Post. But Mr. Perot\u2019s experience offers a cautionary tale. For all his money and easy access to television \u2014 \u201cLarry King Live\u201d was his Twitter \u2014 he still could not crack the duopoly. By the time he ran in 1996, again targeting the two-party system with a vow to \u201ckill that little snake this time,\u201d his share of the popular vote fell to 8 percent. The Reform Party that he created was ultimately taken over by marginal figures \u2014 Mr. Trump ran for that party\u2019s 2000 nomination before dropping out \u2014 and faded from the scene. What Mr. Trump took from Mr. Perot\u2019s experience was that breaking the two-party system from the outside did not work; instead, he had to take over one of the parties from the inside. \u201cThe two-party system has been bankrupt for at least a decade,\u201d said former Representative Carlos Curbelo, Republican of Florida. But \u201cthe barriers to entry in this space are extremely high,\u201d and only Mr. Trump has figured out how to harness Americans\u2019 frustration. \u201cIf the two-party system remains incapable of addressing our nation\u2019s greatest challenges and most controversial issues, younger generations of Americans will find a third way,\u201d Mr. Curbelo said. \u201cUnlike older voters, they will not remain complacent or resign themselves to this political misery.\u201d Nancy Jacobson, founder and chief executive of No Labels, a bipartisan group created in 2010, said the advent of Mr. Trump, combined with what could be a leftward lurch by the Democrats next year, could set the stage for a third party. \u201cThe outsider populists are making it so the problem-solving voters in each party have more in common with each other than with the extremes in their current parties,\u201d she said. \u201cThey could be forced into a new marriage.\u201d Maybe, maybe not. But the threat of divorce within the parties feels palpable.",

      "author": "Annie Karni",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Speaking for over 30 minutes in the hot sun on Friday morning, President Trump lashed out at his critics in no particular order, heaping vitriol on everyone from Democrats running for president to the former Republican House speaker, not to mention a foreign ambassador and the press. The president conducted his impromptu news conference after announcing the resignation of R. Alexander Acosta, the secretary of labor. Mr. Trump spoke over the loud roar of Marine One idling on the South Lawn of the White House, with Mr. Acosta smiling awkwardly at his side. [Read about Mr. Acosta\u2019s resignation over the Jeffrey Epstein plea deal.] The thing that bound Mr. Trump\u2019s disparate group of targets together was their recent public airing \u2014 intended or not \u2014 of something negative about Mr. Trump, or what he viewed as a critical portrayal of his policies. Paul D. Ryan, the former Republican speaker of the House who left Congress in January, recently unloaded on Mr. Trump in a new book by Tim Alberta, describing him as a leader who \u201cdidn\u2019t know anything about government\u201d and saying he \u201cwanted to scold him all the time.\u201d Mr. Ryan described leaving government as an \u201cescape hatch\u201d he used to avoid two more years of working with Mr. Trump. Mr. Ryan\u2019s comments appeared almost to be designed to elicit a rejoinder from a reactive president, and Mr. Trump dutifully engaged, calling Mr. Ryan a politician who was \u201cnot a talent,\u201d \u201cunable to raise money\u201d or get subpoenas, \u201cwhen Nancy Pelosi hands them out like they\u2019re cookies.\u201d Mr. Trump, always sensitive to the idea of former political allies making money off their onetime association with him, also implied that Mr. Ryan was getting paid for talking to Mr. Alberta and said that \u201cthe only success Paul Ryan had was the time he was with me.\u201d Moving on to other targets, Mr. Trump said former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who has been trying to sell himself to Democrats as the levelheaded antidote to Mr. Trump, is \u201cweak and ineffective,\u201d adding, \u201cPresident Xi laughs at guys like that.\u201d He said that Mr. Xi, the president of China, and other foreign leaders \u201cgo to bed at night and they pray that Joe Biden, or somebody like him, becomes president.\u201d Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York, who is also running for president and has coined the term \u201cCon Don\u201d for his onetime constituent, \u201cdoesn\u2019t work very hard,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cNobody knows what the hell he does.\u201d When it came to Kim Darroch, the British ambassador who resigned on Monday after the leak of a confidential email in which he described the Trump administration as \u201cclumsy and inept,\u201d Mr. Trump said he wished him well. That was only after berating him on Twitter as a \u201cvery stupid guy\u201d and a \u201cpompous fool.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s change of tone came, he said, because he was told that Mr. Darroch \u201cactually said very good things about me\u201d and \u201cwas sort of referring to other people\u201d in the leaked cable. \u201cBut they\u2019ve got to stop their leaking problems,\u201d Mr. Trump warned the British embassy. Mr. Trump condemned two freshman congresswomen who are frequent critics of the administration, Representative Ilhan Omar, Democrat of Minnesota, and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York, capitalizing on an intraparty feud that has gripped the House majority. The freshman Democrats have accused Ms. Pelosi of singling them out for criticism because they are women of color. [Read about the tensions between Ms. Pelosi and progressive Democrats.] Ms. Omar \u201cshouldn\u2019t even be in office\u201d Mr. Trump said, noting that the Muslim congresswoman is part of a group of freshman Democrats who \u201cI don\u2019t even know where they come from.\u201d He also dinged Ms. Ocasio-Cortez for her chilly relationship with Ms. Pelosi, the speaker of the House. \u201cI think Cortez is being very disrespectful to somebody that\u2019s been there a long time,\u201d he said. Mr. Trump also offered an unusual defense of Ms. Pelosi, whom in the past he has called \u201cCrazy Nancy,\u201d noting that \u201cshe is not a racist. For them to call her a racist is a disgrace.\u201d But he saved perhaps the greatest ad hominem attack of the morning for his perpetual foil, The New York Times, a newspaper that Mr. Trump singled out for a report on the conditions in  Border Patrol detention centers. \u201cThey have phony sources,\u201d he said. \u201cI almost cried about that phony story,\u201d he said, calling The Times a \u201cvery dishonest newspaper. What they do is a tremendous disservice to this country. They are truly the enemy of the people.\u201d The Times, in a statement last week, said it was \u201cconfident in the accuracy of our reporting on the U.S. Border Patrol\u2019s detention centers.\u201d [Read about conditions inside the detention center in Clint, Tex.] Mr. Trump said that Vice President Mike Pence would be visiting detention centers to view the conditions there firsthand. \u201cAnd that was my idea,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d love to be there.\u201d Then, finally he sent Mr. Acosta off with a handshake and a backslap, sending him back into the White House, before trudging across the lawn and finally boarding his helicopter.",

      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump said on Sunday that a group of four minority congresswomen feuding with Speaker Nancy Pelosi should \u201cgo back\u201d to the countries they came from rather than \u201cloudly and viciously telling the people of the United States\u201d how to run the government. Wrapped inside that insult, which was widely established as a racist trope, was a factually inaccurate claim: Only one of the lawmakers was born outside the country. Even though Mr. Trump has repeatedly refused to back down from stoking racial divisions, his willingness to deploy a lowest-rung slur \u2014 one commonly and crudely used to single out the perceived foreignness of nonwhite, non-Christian people \u2014 was largely regarded as beyond the pale. [Update: Four congresswomen denounce Trump after he says they hate America.] \u201cSo interesting to see \u2018Progressive\u2019 Democrat Congresswomen, who originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe, the worst, most corrupt and inept anywhere in the world,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter, \u201cnow loudly and viciously telling the people of the United States, the greatest and most powerful Nation on earth, how our government is to be run.\u201d Mr. Trump added: \u201cWhy don\u2019t they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came. Then come back and show us how it is done.\u201d Delivered on the day he had promised widespread immigration raids, Mr. Trump\u2019s comments signaled a new low in how far he will go to affect public discourse surrounding the issue. And if his string of tweets was meant to further widen Democratic divisions in an intraparty fight, the strategy appeared quickly to backfire: House Democrats, including Ms. Pelosi, rallied around the women, declaring in blunt terms that Mr. Trump\u2019s words echoed other xenophobic comments he has made about nonwhite immigrants. [When it comes to race, Mr. Trump plays with fire like no other president in a century.] As the president\u2019s remarks reverberated around Twitter, a chorus of Americans took to social media to say that they had heard some version of Mr. Trump\u2019s words throughout their lives, beginning with childhood taunts on the playground. Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey and a presidential candidate, joined scores of people who said it was jarring to hear the phrase from the president. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard this our whole lives,\u201d Mr. Booker said. \u201cNow we hear it from the Oval Office.\u201d Ms. Pelosi may have offered the bluntest take on Mr. Trump\u2019s comments when she said his campaign slogan, \u201cMake America Great Again,\u201d \u201chas always been about making America white again.\u201d Broadly, Mr. Trump\u2019s attack on lawmakers appeared to be meant for members of the so-called squad, a group of liberal Democratic freshmen engaged in an existential and generational war of words with Ms. Pelosi: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ayanna S. Pressley of Massachusetts. But only one of the women, Ms. Omar, who is from Somalia, was born outside the United States. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez was born in the Bronx to parents of Puerto Rican descent. Ms. Pressley, who is black, was born in Cincinnati and raised in Chicago. And Ms. Tlaib was born in Detroit to Palestinian immigrants. \u201cThese places need your help badly, you can\u2019t leave fast enough,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI\u2019m sure that Nancy Pelosi would be very happy to quickly work out free travel arrangements!\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s comments were a crude addition to his continued rhetoric that the United States is too full to take in people from other countries. \u201cSorry, can\u2019t let them into our Country,\u201d Mr. Trump also tweeted on Sunday, referring to the groups of men held in filthy conditions in detention centers at the border. He suggested that those groups were \u201cloaded up with a big percentage of criminals.\u201d His tweets came on the same weekend that Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents began rounding up some 2,000 undocumented immigrants, many of whom had recently crossed the border in groups or families. Mr. Trump\u2019s attack on the congresswomen also followed days of Fox News coverage that centered on Ms. Omar. During her tenure in Congress, Ms. Omar has rattled fellow Democrats and provided ammunition to Republicans for her repeated criticisms of Israel, including a comment that pro-Israel activists were pushing \u201cfor allegiance to a foreign country.\u201d Prompted by an emergency border aid package that liberals felt did not place sufficient restrictions on the Trump administration, the back and forth between the freshmen women, Democratic moderates in the House and Ms. Pelosi has also been bruising. The speaker spent much of the last week trying to return harmony to her restive caucus, and tensions were still raw heading into the weekend. When Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s chief of staff, Saikat Chakrabarti, singled out Representative Sharice Davids, a moderate Democrat and Native American from Kansas, for voting in favor of the aid package, House Democrats used their official Twitter account to slap back. \u201cWho is this guy and why is he explicitly singling out a Native American woman of color?\u201d they wrote. [Mr. Chakrabarti has become a symbol of Democratic division.] On Sunday, Mr. Trump may have provided the impetus for a reconciliation \u2014 however brief \u2014 that Democratic leaders and rank-and-file House members quickly embraced. Ms. Pelosi condemned Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks as \u201cxenophobic\u201d in a pair of tweets of her own, turning them around to criticize Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration policies and project Democratic unity. \u201cOur diversity is our strength and our unity is our power,\u201d she wrote of Democrats. \u201cRather than attack Members of Congress, he should work with us for humane immigration policy that reflects American values,\u201d she wrote in another tweet. \u201cStop the raids.\u201d A spokesman for Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, declined to comment on Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks. Representatives for Republican House leaders did not respond to emails seeking comment. The White House also did not respond to a request for comment. But Democrats began sharing their own stories, pointing out that Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks did not reflect a country whose lawmakers \u2014 and citizens \u2014 are becoming increasingly more diverse. Representative Joaquin Castro, Democrat of Texas and the chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, called Mr. Trump a \u201cbigot.\u201d Representative Justin Amash of Michigan, who left the Republican Party this month over differences with Mr. Trump and is the child of Syrian and Palestinian immigrants, declared the comments \u201cracist and disgusting.\u201d All four lawmakers in \u201cthe squad\u201d eventually weighed in and responded to the president. \u201cYou are stoking white nationalism,\u201d Ms. Omar said, because \u201cyou are angry that people like us are serving in Congress and fighting against your hate-filled agenda.\u201d Ms. Pressley, sharing a screenshot of the president\u2019s tweet, declared, \u201cTHIS is what racism looks like.\u201d Ms. Tlaib said his comments \u201cjust make me work harder,\u201d and that she is \u201cfighting corruption in OUR country.\u201d And Ms. Ocasio-Cortez sent out a series of tweets addressing the president directly. \u201cMr. President,\u201d she said in one, \u201cthe country I \u2018come from\u2019 & the country we all swear to, is the United States.\u201d But by Sunday evening, Mr. Trump again criticized Democrats for defending members of the group. \u201cIf the Democrat Party wants to continue to condone such disgraceful behavior,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Twitter, \u201cthen we look even more forward to seeing you at the ballot box in 2020!\u201d Ms. Omar and Ms. Tlaib are far from the only congressional lawmakers who immigrated to the United States or were born to immigrant parents. In the House, there are currently at least 52 voting members who are immigrants or children of immigrants and 16 in the Senate \u2014 most of them Democrats \u2014 according to a Pew Research Center analysis from this year. Aside from Ms. Omar, four other congresswomen were born outside the United States, but they have largely not involved themselves in entanglements with Ms. Pelosi. Ms. Omar has been vocal about her life as a refugee who fled Somalia and eventually settled in America, only to be disappointed with the country she found. More than any of the others in her freshman group, Ms. Omar \u2014 one of the first two Muslim women in Congress along with Ms. Tlaib \u2014 has forcefully used her personal story to make the argument that loving America does not require an acceptance of its shortcomings. \u201cI grew up in an extremely unjust society, and the only thing that made my family excited about coming to the United States was that the United States was supposed to be the country that guaranteed justice to all,\u201d Ms. Omar recently said. \u201cSo, I feel it necessary for me to speak about that promise that\u2019s not kept.\u201d Comments like these have inflamed Fox News personalities like Tucker Carlson, who used his television program to lash out at Ms. Omar. \u201cOur country rescued Ilhan Omar,\u201d Mr. Carlson said in a broadcast last week. \u201cWe didn\u2019t do it to get rich; in fact, it cost us money. We did it because we are kind people. How did Omar respond to the remarkable gift we gave her? She scolded us, and called us names, she showered us with contempt.\u201d Mr. Trump has repeatedly said that he does not hold racist views, despite his public statements. After a 2017 white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va., Mr. Trump was widely condemned for saying that people on \u201cboth sides\u201d were to blame after one of the nationalists mowed down a group of protesters and killed a woman. And he was one of the most vocal proponents of the conspiracy theory that President Barack Obama was not born in the United States. At other times, he has used vulgar language to describe immigrants and people of color. He has defended himself after calling people crossing into the country illegally \u201canimals\u201d \u2014 he said was referring only to MS-13 gang members. He has assailed players with the National Football League, many of whom are black, for taking a knee during the national anthem. And he has used a vulgar term to disparage immigrants from largely black nations. But, to his critics, Mr. Trump\u2019s comments on Sunday were a low point. \u201cIt is sad to see the occupant of the Oval Office transition from empowering and encouraging racist taunts to actually using them himself,\u201d said Nihad Awad, the national executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. \u201cIf Trump shouted the same thing at a Muslim woman wearing hijab in a Walmart, he might be arrested.\u201d",

Sends Signal for 2020|July 16, 2019, Page A1",
      "author": "Carl Hulse",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 The lack of widespread Republican condemnation of President Trump for his comments about four Democratic congresswomen of color illustrated both the tightening stranglehold Mr. Trump has on his party and the belief of many Republicans that an attack on progressivism should in fact be a central element of the 2020 campaign. While a smattering of Republicans chastised Mr. Trump on Monday, most party leaders in the House and Senate and much of the rank-and-file remained quiet about the president\u2019s weekend tweets directing dissenters to \u201cgo back\u201d where they came from. He followed up on those comments on Monday with harsh language directed at \u201cpeople who hate America\u201d \u2014 an inflammatory accusation to be leveled against elected members of the House. With Mr. Trump far more popular with Republican voters than incumbent Republican members of Congress, most are loath to cross the president and risk reprisals. The case of Representative Justin Amash, the Michigan lawmaker who was forced to leave the party after he dared to suggest Mr. Trump should be impeached, serves as a cautionary tale. At the same time, many Republicans are seeking to label the four congresswomen and their ideas as \u201cfar left,\u201d seeing it as a potential foundation of a sweeping critique of Democrats in 2020. In an appearance on Fox News, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, called the four \u201ca bunch of communists,\u201d a step beyond the president, who said he was at the moment only willing to go so far as calling them \u201csocialists.\u201d [Analysis: No president in modern times has made appeals to the resentments of white Americans as overtly as Mr. Trump.] Both the willingness of Republicans to attach extremist labels to Democrats and the Democratic assault against Mr. Trump as a racist and white supremacist presage a particularly bitter 2020 campaign. Even those lawmakers who took Mr. Trump to task were careful to underscore their differences with the political and policy views of the House Democrats at the center of the storm \u2014 Representatives Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ayanna S. Pressley of Massachusetts and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota. Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, one of the few Republicans who has criticized Mr. Trump since he became president, told a Boston TV station that while the president might have gone too far, \u201cI certainly feel that a number of these new members of Congress have views that are not consistent with my experience and not consistent with building a strong America.\u201d \u201cI couldn\u2019t disagree more with these congresswomen\u2019s views on immigration, socialism, national security and virtually every policy issue,\u201d said Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania. \u201cBut they are entitled to their opinions, however misguided they may be.\u201d Senator Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican who faces a potentially difficult re-election campaign next year, sought to dodge the debate over the president\u2019s comments and focus on the differences between the parties. \u201cThe reality is I want to shift back to the issues and the America they represent versus the America that I want to see,\u201d Mr. Tillis told reporters. The rapid approach of the 2020 campaign has drawn Mr. Trump and Republicans on Capitol Hill closer as the lawmakers see their fate inextricably linked to the president, diminishing any possibility that they would break from Mr. Trump. And the spotlight put on the Democratic presidential candidates and the advocacy by some of them for eliminating private health insurance in favor of a government program, sweeping revisions in the tax code and the institution of liberal immigration policies have galvanized Republicans. They see Mr. Trump, as outrageous and unpredictable as he might be, as far preferable to any of the Democrats. \u201cI\u2019m not going to vote for a socialist,\u201d said Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado, perhaps the most endangered Republican in the Senate, who has made clear he is firmly allied with the president. Republicans may cringe at some of Mr. Trump\u2019s crude comments and insults. They may wince at his easily unmasked falsehoods. They may roll their eyes at his lack of understanding of government fundamentals. To many, his personality itself is off-putting. But he is now their guy. Despite occasional rifts, Republicans have in the main tried to ignore Mr. Trump\u2019s nearly daily Twitter battles. Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican and majority leader, routinely refuses to engage when pressed about remarks by Mr. Trump that have electrified social media. Other Republicans say they do not see it as their job to be political pundits or to join with the news media and Democrats in castigating Mr. Trump. They also believe that, in most cases, the firestorm lasts only so long and will be quickly followed by the next iteration, making it pointless to get caught up in the repeating cycle. Over the course of the administration, most Republicans have grown accustomed to Mr. Trump\u2019s fiery outbursts and practiced in how to avoid commenting on them. They find the president, a man who wields his cellphone like a weapon, to be almost always accessible, cajoling and complimenting lawmakers who appreciate the attention. They have also gained experience in how to diplomatically push back against the president and challenge his views when they differ \u2014 though usually in private to avoid inciting his ire. \u201cMy personal recipe for a productive relationship with the president is to work with him in public all I can,\u201d said Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas. \u201cWhen we have disagreements, as we\u2019ve had on tariffs and things like that, we talk in private, try not to embarrass him or ourselves. I\u2019ve found that\u2019s a good way to handle it.\u201d Recognizing this pattern, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, accused Senate Republicans on Monday of cowardice. \u201cIt\u2019s become frighteningly common for many of my Republican colleagues to let these moments sail by without saying even a word,\u201d Mr. Schumer said. \u201cRepublican leadership \u2014 especially \u2014 rarely criticizes the president directly even in a situation like this that so clearly merits it.\u201d Jeff Flake, the former Arizona Republican senator whose feud with Mr. Trump helped end his congressional career, said he sympathized with the desire of his former colleagues not to address every comment made by Mr. Trump. \u201cBut there are times when the president\u2019s comments are so vile and offensive that it is incumbent on Republicans to respond and condemn,\u201d he said on Twitter. \u201cThis is one of those times.\u201d Those hoping for a wide rupture between the president and the more conventional Republican politicians on Capitol Hill say they have finally come to terms with the reality that no break is in the offing with the economy prospering, the election looming and the Trump administration so far avoiding a cataclysmic foreign policy blunder. \u201cThey have made their bed and are trying to sleep in it and hope they don\u2019t have nightmares,\u201d said William Kristol, the conservative Trump critic. \u201cThey don\u2019t feel like they are paying a huge price.\u201d Mr. Kristol said he once believed that the combination of the 2018 election results, the extended government shutdown and the departure of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis \u2014 a source of comfort for Republicans who feared Trump would do something rash with the military \u2014 might give congressional Republicans pause. But any deep distress that existed seems to have dissipated. \u201cI am more pessimistic about the notion that the Republican Party will throw off Trump than I was a year ago,\u201d he said. Instead, Republicans worry that, even at a moment when the president is stirring division, a perceived slight or unwarranted criticism could lead Mr. Trump to throw them off, an outcome that could be ruinous to their political careers.",

      "author": "Julie Hirschfeld Davis",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump, under fire for comments that even members of his own party called racist, amplified his attacks on four Democratic congresswomen of color on Monday, saying that they hated America and that one of the first two Muslim women elected to Congress sympathized with Al Qaeda. In an extraordinary back and forth from opposite ends of Pennsylvania Avenue, Mr. Trump appeared to revel in the viciousness of his brawl with the four progressive women who have become the young faces of the Democratic Party. He goaded them into a response from Capitol Hill in which they denounced the president\u2019s rhetoric and his policies, charging that he was pressing the agenda of white nationalists from the White House. \u201cHe\u2019s launching a blatantly racist attack on four duly elected members of the United States House of Representatives, all of whom are women of color,\u201d said Representative Ilhan Omar, Democrat of Minnesota and the target of Mr. Trump\u2019s most outrageous charges. \u201cThis is the agenda of white nationalists, whether it is happening in chat rooms, or it is happening on national TV, and now it\u2019s reached the White House garden.\u201d The exchange was the latest episode in a presidency in which Mr. Trump has skittered from condemnations of black athletes kneeling during the national anthem to insults lobbed at developing countries to a defense of protesters at a white supremacist march. But now Mr. Trump is going after members of the majority party in the House, capable of fighting back. The congresswomen vowed not to be baited into a sprint to the bottom with a president they condemned as racist, xenophobic, misogynistic and criminal. Their leader, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, pledged to put a resolution on the floor condemning the president\u2019s language \u2014 putting House Republicans on defense. But Mr. Trump showed no sign of relenting. Even as the four spoke, he was online calling them \u201cradical Democrats\u201d and Twitter-shouting, \u201cIF YOU ARE NOT HAPPY HERE, YOU CAN LEAVE!\u201d It was a message the president appeared determined to amplify throughout the day. \u201cThey\u2019re free to leave if they want,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Monday morning of the congresswomen, referring to Representatives Omar, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ayanna S. Pressley of Massachusetts. On Sunday, he tweeted that the social-media-savvy women known as \u201cthe squad\u201d should \u201cgo back\u201d to the countries they came from, a well-worn racist trope that dates back centuries. [Analysis: No president in modern times has made appeals to the resentments of white Americans as overtly as Mr. Trump.] On Monday, he added that Ms. Omar, a Somali refugee and the only one not born in the United States, was a Qaeda sympathizer \u2014 a false charge that she said she would not \u201cdignify\u201d with an answer. \u201cEvery time there is a white supremacist who attacks or there is a white man who kills in a school or in a movie theater, or in a mosque, or in a synagogue, I don\u2019t expect my white community members to respond on whether they love that person or not,\u201d she said. At their news conference, the four condemned rhetoric that they said was intended to distract from what they called brutal, misguided policies and misconduct in office. \u201cThis is simply a disruption and a distraction from the callous, chaotic and corrupt culture of this administration,\u201d said Ms. Pressley, who made a point of not referring to the president by name, instead calling him \u201cthe occupant of the White House.\u201d In his appearance earlier Monday, Mr. Trump had sought to deflect criticism about his tweets even as he made it clear he stood behind them, saying it was Ms. Pelosi who was the real racist. As evidence, he pointed to a tweet in which Ms. Pelosi said his statements about the congresswomen confirmed that his \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d slogan \u201chas always been about making America white again.\u201d Mr. Trump repeatedly sought refuge, as he often has before, in what he insisted was broad public agreement with his inflammatory comments. \u201cA lot of people love it by the way,\u201d the president said. Asked whether he was concerned that his comments were racist and being embraced by white supremacists, who took to Twitter to cheer them, Mr. Trump shrugged. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t concern me, because many people agree with me,\u201d he said. \u201cAll I\u2019m saying is if they want to leave, they can leave now.\u201d But even as he spoke, a handful of Republicans joined a chorus of Democrats in criticizing his incendiary posts, a rare break that demonstrated the degree to which the latest episode is being regarded as a new low for a president who has repeatedly shown a penchant for diminishing the level of discourse. Representative Michael R. Turner, Republican of Ohio, wrote on Twitter that the president\u2019s tweets \u201cwere racist and he should apologize,\u201d adding, \u201cWe must work as a country to rise above hate, not enable it.\u201d And Representative Will Hurd of Texas, the lone African-American among House Republicans, called the president\u2019s remarks \u201cracist and xenophobic.\u201d Others gently distanced themselves from the tweets \u2014 \u201caim higher,\u201d Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said during an interview on Fox News, the president\u2019s favorite channel \u2014 but grabbed the opportunity to criticize the progressive policies for which the squad has become the most visible advocates. Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, the only African-American Republican in the Senate, called out both the Democrats\u2019 policies and Mr. Trump. \u201cInstead of sharing how the Democratic Party\u2019s far-left, pro-socialist policies \u2014 not to mention the hateful language some of their members have used towards law enforcement and Jews \u2014 are wrong for the future of our nation,\u201d he said, \u201cthe president interjected with unacceptable personal attacks and racially offensive language. No matter our political disagreements, aiming for the lowest common denominator will only divide our nation further.\u201d Mr. Trump appeared to have particular contempt for Ms. Omar, who came to the country as a child and wears a hijab. Mr. Trump falsely accused the Minnesota congresswoman of proclaiming \u201clove\u201d for Al Qaeda, \u201ctalking about how great Al Qaeda is\u201d and saying that \u201cwhen I think of Al Qaeda, I can hold my chest out.\u201d He was distorting remarks she made in a 2013 interview with a local television program on Middle Eastern community issues. In the interview, Ms. Omar repeatedly denounced Al Qaeda and one of its affiliates, Al Shabab, for committing \u201cheinous\u201d and \u201cevil\u201d acts and \u201catrocities.\u201d The \u201chold my chest out\u201d comment, which came during a discussion about why the Arabic names of terrorist groups are left untranslated, referred to her description of how she said a former college professor said \u201cAl Qaeda\u201d with physical intensity to emphasize the weight of the words. The war of words shifted the spotlight, at least for now, away from internal divisions among Democrats that had taken on a racial dimension, after Ms. Pelosi publicly sparred with the congresswomen and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez suggested that they were being targeted because of their race. Instead, Democrats were focused Monday on their fight with Mr. Trump, as the speaker has repeatedly counseled it should be, lest they play into the hands of an opportunistic president. In a letter to colleagues that called the tweets against the congresswomen \u201cdisgusting attacks,\u201d Ms. Pelosi announced that the House would move to officially reject the sentiment in a resolution. \u201cLet me be clear, our caucus will continue to forcefully respond to these disgusting attacks,\u201d Ms. Pelosi wrote. \u201cThe House cannot allow the president\u2019s characterization of immigrants to our country to stand. Our Republican colleagues must join us in condemning the president\u2019s xenophobic tweets.\u201d The resolution, which was introduced on Monday evening by Representative Tom Malinowski of New Jersey, who was born in Poland, cites positive statements by the nation\u2019s founders and past presidents of both parties about the importance of immigrants to the United States, and asserts that the House \u201cstrongly condemns President Trump\u2019s racist comments that have legitimized increased fear and hatred of new Americans and people of color.\u201d It mentions both Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cgo back\u201d tweet and his branding of immigrants and asylum seekers as \u201cinvaders.\u201d Other Democrats pressed to go further. Ms. Omar and Ms. Tlaib argued that the president\u2019s latest behavior was fresh grounds to impeach him. And Representative Steve Cohen of Tennessee introduced a resolution, backed by the four congresswomen, to formally censure Mr. Trump for what he called \u201cthis un-American and unpresidential language.\u201d Mr. Scott and Mr. Hurd said the president\u2019s remarks were particularly detrimental because they appeared to unify Democrats at a time when they had been engaged in an internal dispute about race. For months there has been a rift between Ms. Pelosi and the four lawmakers, and last week tensions grew when Ms. Pelosi pointedly said they had no following in Congress. The four women opposed a $4.6 billion aid package for the border, approved by Congress, because they said it supported Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration policies. The tone of the president\u2019s remarks, however, is something they agree on. \u201cWe\u2019ll stay focused on our agenda and we won\u2019t get caught slipping, because all of this is a distraction,\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said. Mr. Trump clearly sees a political advantage in his targeting of the congresswomen, betting that by focusing attention on them, he will be better able to paint all Democrats with a broad brush of socialism and radical policies. \u201cThe Dems were trying to distance themselves from the four \u2018progressives,\u2019 but now they are forced to embrace them,\u201d Mr. Trump gloated on Twitter on Monday evening. \u201cThat means they are endorsing Socialism, hate of Israel and the USA! Not good for the Democrats!\u201d Cornell Belcher, a Democratic pollster and strategist, said Mr. Trump\u2019s latest remarks reflected a broader strategy to use the same kind of racial animus that helped propel his 2016 presidential bid to bolster his base for his 2020 re-election push. \u201cHe\u2019s crazy like a fox, and it only makes perfectly good sense for him to go back to what got him here in the first place, which is driving this racial angst in the electorate,\u201d Mr. Belcher said. There are risks for Democrats in the strategy, he added, if they accede to Mr. Trump\u2019s wishes. \u201cTo a certain extent, the electorate already gets that Donald Trump is racist and he says racist, offensive things, so of course, you have to condemn what he says as a matter of principle,\u201d Mr. Belcher said. \u201cBut from a strategic standpoint, does it get you anything to fall into where he clearly wants the battle to be fought? It\u2019s almost like he\u2019s picking the battlefield for 2020.\u201d",

      "author": "Julie Hirschfeld Davis",
      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 The House on Wednesday killed an attempt to impeach President Trump for statements that the chamber condemned this week as racist, turning aside an accusation that he had brought \u201cridicule, disgrace and disrepute\u201d to his office. The move split Democrats, underscoring the divisions within the party over whether they should use their majority to charge Mr. Trump and try to remove him from office, with 95 signaling their support for at least considering the question further, and 137 moving to stop the current effort in its tracks. The president brushed off the vote as a victory, and hours later, at a rally in Greenville, N.C., he showed no signs of easing his attacks or toning down the vicious language that led to the impeachment attempt. He charged that the \u201cdangerous, militant hard left\u201d among the Democrats were \u201chate-filled extremists who are constantly trying to tear our country down.\u201d By the end of the rally, Mr. Trump went even further, accusing them of seeking the \u201cdestruction of our country.\u201d \u201cThey don\u2019t love our country,\u201d he told the roaring crowd. \u201cI think, in some cases, they hate our country. You know what? If they don\u2019t love it, tell them to leave it.\u201d Mr. Trump specifically went after the four freshman congresswomen \u2014 all women of color \u2014 whom he urged this week \u201cto go back\u201d to their country of origin. Of the four, only Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, a refugee from Somalia, was born overseas. At the mention of her name, the crowd chanted: \u201cSend her back! Send her back!\u201d The 332-to-95 vote to table the impeachment article drafted by Representative Al Green, Democrat of Texas, constituted the first action by the House since Democrats took control in January on a measure to impeach Mr. Trump, a significant move that Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and other party leaders have toiled to avoid. By agreeing to table the article, Ms. Pelosi and the Democrats put off \u2014 at least for now \u2014 a prolonged and divisive debate over whether Mr. Trump\u2019s conduct warrants his expulsion. But it was hardly the last word on the topic from Democrats torn about how to deal with the president, between progressives who want to challenge him more aggressively and moderates desperate to quash talk of impeachment and stick to a poll-tested agenda that includes improving health coverage and raising wages for working people. Ms. Pelosi has been caught in the middle as she tries to maintain some semblance of control over the party\u2019s agenda while Mr. Trump increasingly dictates the terms of the debate. Those dynamics have already dominated the House\u2019s business this week. For two days, Democrats feuded with the president over his posts on Twitter about four freshman Democratic congresswomen of color. \u201cYou have to give him credit: He\u2019s a great distractor,\u201d Ms. Pelosi, Democrat of California, said of Mr. Trump on Wednesday. She waved off questions about whether the Democrats\u2019 policy priorities were being eclipsed by the president, saying, \u201cWe\u2019re not having him set our agenda; we\u2019re setting our own agenda.\u201d But in recent days, thanks to Mr. Trump\u2019s penchant for stirring up the hottest of political controversies and simmering divisions within their own ranks, House Democrats have not seemed to be able to get out of their own way. This week has been a case in point. Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets prompted a rush by Democratic leaders to press a resolution condemning him. The vote on the measure took place on Tuesday, and the floor debate devolved into an extraordinarily polarizing spectacle as Republicans and Democrats argued about whether it was appropriate for Ms. Pelosi to have branded the president\u2019s tweets \u201cracist.\u201d Then Mr. Green\u2019s decision to force action on his impeachment resolution stretched the narrative into Wednesday, overshadowing marquee Democratic issues, including a vote this week to raise the minimum wage to $15 and one to repeal a tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health plans. \u201cIt\u2019s time for us to deal with his bigotry,\u201d Mr. Green said on Wednesday. \u201cThis president has demonstrated that he\u2019s willing to yell \u2018fire\u2019 in a crowded theater, and we have seen what can happen to people when bigotry is allowed to have a free rein. We all ought to go on record. We all ought to let the world know where we stand when we have a bigot in the White House.\u201d A separate vote on Wednesday evening to hold in contempt William P. Barr, the attorney general, and Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, for their refusal to comply with an investigation into the addition of a citizenship question to the census \u2014 a move the administration has since abandoned \u2014 added to the portrait of a House floor dominated by Mr. Trump and what Democrats consider his misdeeds. \u201cI wonder, when I watch people campaign and they talk about what they want to achieve here, how many said they wanted to have a week of contempt, of impeach and resolution all after one entity, the president of the United States?\u201d said Representative Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California and the minority leader. \u201cI didn\u2019t have anybody on either side of the aisle ever ask me that question.\u201d Privately, House Democratic leaders coached lawmakers to stay focused on policy achievements that they could tout when they return home for a six-week summer recess beginning in 10 days. In a closed-door meeting in the basement of the Capitol, the chiefs of the party\u2019s messaging arm urged lawmakers to use events in their home districts during the recess to spotlight the legislation they have passed to address health care costs, wages and corruption. But just outside the room, reporters swarmed Mr. Green, pressing him for details about his impeachment resolution. At one point, Representative Debbie Dingell of Michigan, one of the party\u2019s messaging leaders, popped out of the meeting, stopped before a bank of television cameras and pleaded to talk about anything but impeachment. \u201cYou know what I think? I wish that all of you would ask me about prescription drugs,\u201d Mrs. Dingell said, before ultimately giving up. Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, the No. 3 House Democrat, conceded on Wednesday that the party was having a hard time focusing voters\u2019 attention on the minimum wage or any other policy they were pushing. \u201cThe American people need to be informed about what it is their legislators are doing,\u201d Mr. Clyburn lamented during an interview on CNN, \u201cand not be so preoccupied with a lawless president who seems not to care much about the law.\u201d The trouble is, House Democrats have been unable to shift the spotlight at crucial moments, particularly given the pent-up desire among some of their members to meet Mr. Trump\u2019s over-the-top behavior with dramatic ripostes of their own. That was the case with his tweets against the four congresswomen, which prompted some Democrats to call for his censure or impeachment. Knowing how problematic such a vote would be for centrist lawmakers in Republican-leaning districts, Ms. Pelosi opted for a mere condemnation of the president\u2019s rhetoric, which she said on Wednesday had been deliberately meant to be as \u201cbenign\u201d as possible. \u201cPart of the feral genius of Trump is that even when he has not fully thought it through, by behaving outrageously, he demands a response,\u201d said David Axelrod, a Democratic strategist who was a senior White House adviser to President Barack Obama. \u201cPelosi tried to thread a needle by choosing the least disruptive response that would give the broadest number of people the opportunity to express themselves.\u201d Mr. Axelrod said the difficulty for Democrats is in striking the right balance between trumpeting their achievements while presenting a vivid alternative to Mr. Trump\u2019s penchant for norm-shattering behavior. \u201cYou need a little jujitsu to turn that against him and make people focus on the sheer opportunism of it and the bankruptcy of it \u2014 and the cost to the country of just being locked in it day after day,\u201d he said. Mr. Green\u2019s resolution on impeachment made no mention of Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s report or other instances of possible abuses of power by the president that are being studied by the House Judiciary Committee as possible grounds for impeachment. Instead, it contained a single article that referred to the vote on Tuesday to condemn Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets as racist, and concluded: \u201cDonald John Trump has, by his statements, brought the high office of the president of the United States in contempt, ridicule, disgrace, and disrepute, has sown seeds of discord among the people of the United States, has demonstrated that he is unfit to be president, and has betrayed his trust as president of the United States to the manifest injury of the people of the United States, and has committed a high misdemeanor in office.\u201d Ms. Pelosi said that she had no quarrel with Mr. Green, but that the House was already taking sufficient steps to hold Mr. Trump accountable for his conduct. \u201cWe have six committees that are working on following the facts in terms of any abuse of power, obstruction of justice and the rest that the president may have engaged in,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is the serious path that we are on.\u201d Mr. McCarthy, who moved to kill the resolution on impeachment, later told a reporter he had done so \u201cbecause I think it\u2019s stupid.\u201d Wednesday\u2019s vote did not necessarily reflect the depth of enthusiasm or opposition for impeachment among Democrats. Some who voted to kill the measure said they had done so not because they were against impeachment, while others who voted to keep it alive said they did not favor impeaching Mr. Trump. Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the Judiciary Committee chairman, said he had voted to kill the measure because it should have been referred to his panel, which has jurisdiction over the matter. \u201cI very much doubt that today will be the last action we must consider to hold President Trump accountable,\u201d he said in a statement. One Democrat, Representative Peter A. DeFazio of Oregon, voted \u201cpresent.\u201d Speaking with reporters on Wednesday morning, Mr. Green acknowledged differences with Democratic leaders, but framed his decision to force the impeachment vote as strictly a matter of conscience. Mr. Green, who first drafted articles of impeachment after Mr. Trump\u2019s comments about the clash between white supremacists and protesters in Charlottesville, Va., has twice before forced similar votes. But in both cases, Republicans controlled the chamber and voted overwhelmingly to table his resolutions.",

      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 When President Trump suggested foreign-born Americans should \u201cgo back\u201d to the countries they were born in if they do not like it here, he may not have realized that his entreaty could have been addressed to 5 percent of Congress. In all, 29 members of the House and Senate were born abroad, about half of them to parents serving in the military or working overseas. They include a doctor born in Mexico (Representative Raul Ruiz, Democrat of California); a lawyer born in Japan (Senator Mazie K. Hirono, Democrat of Hawaii); a women\u2019s rights advocate born in India (Representative Pramila Jayapal, Democrat of Washington); and a real estate developer born in an Army hospital in France (Representative Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina). Republicans like Mr. Meadows and Representative David Rouzer, also of North Carolina and born in an Army hospital in West Germany, have mostly stood by the president, who aimed his remarks at four progressive House Democratic women of color, only one of whom was born outside the United States. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s racist,\u201d Mr. Rouzer said. But to others, Mr. Trump\u2019s words \u2014 which he repeated on Tuesday \u2014 hit home in a deeply personal way, resurfacing painful memories of past racial taunts. Those feelings were reflected in the resolution the House took up Tuesday condemning Mr. Trump. Immigrant Democrats led the effort on the House floor. [Read the latest on the resolution and the turmoil over Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks.] \u201cI first took the oath to support and defend the Constitution when I was 10 years old,\u201d said Representative Tom Malinowski, the resolution\u2019s chief sponsor, who was born in Poland and came here when he was 6, after his mother met an American journalist. \u201cThat\u2019s meant a lot to me all my life.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cgo back\u201d remarks have long been a thread through the fabric of the United States, a nation founded by people who came from somewhere else. In every era, in every generation, and particularly in times of economic anxiety, notions of \u201cthe other\u201d have seeped into the American psyche. But no modern president \u2014 not even Franklin D. Roosevelt, who ordered the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II \u2014 has made such aggressive use of his platform to whip up a fervor about foreigners. That is making even some Republicans uncomfortable. Among them is Representative Daniel Crenshaw, a freshman Republican from Texas. Mr. Crenshaw, a former Navy SEAL, was born to American parents in Scotland, where his father worked in the oil industry, and he spent part of his childhood in Ecuador and Colombia. \u201cI don\u2019t agree with the president\u2019s remarks, but that doesn\u2019t mean I accept the rhetoric we hear repeatedly from this group of lawmakers, either,\u201d he said in an emailed statement, adding, \u201cI find the constantly negative, anti-American comments concerning and tiresome.\u201d There are 14 members of Congress \u2014 all Democrats, 13 in the House and one in the Senate \u2014 who became citizens after emigrating to the United States, either through naturalization or a parent\u2019s citizenship. They come from countries like India, Peru, Mexico, Guatemala, Vietnam and Taiwan. Ms. Hirono is a naturalized citizen; she spent her early childhood on her grandparents\u2019 rice farm in Japan until her mother came to the United States after fleeing an abusive husband. Representative Jes\u00fas \u201cChuy\u201d Garc\u00eda, Democrat of Illinois, is a naturalized citizen from Mexico. Representative Adriano Espaillat, Democrat of New York, is also a naturalized citizen, born in the Dominican Republic. \u201cI dream American. I wake up American. I have dinner as an American,\u201d Mr. Espaillat said. \u201cI am a Yankee fan, and I love this country. It\u2019s given me a great number of opportunities, including to be a member of Congress. For him to downgrade or even not take into consideration the kind of opportunities that this country gives these folks from all over the world, I think is sad and tragic.\u201d Far from making them less American, many foreign-born members of Congress said their experiences as children abroad made them far more appreciative of the freedom and opportunity in the United States than others who have spent little time in countries that lack such gifts. \u201cI grew up in Latin America at a time when most of the countries were under military dictatorship and soldiers were on corners with machine guns,\u201d said Representative Jim Himes, Democrat of Connecticut, who was born in Peru. That experience, he said, \u201chas given me an unbelievable appreciation for the freedoms and liberties that we have here.\u201d Some white lawmakers born abroad saw a distinctly racial tinge to Mr. Trump\u2019s singling out of women of color. \u201cMy father got back from the Vietnam War, went to graduate school, and when he and my mom were young newlyweds, got a job outside of Dublin on a cattle feed lot,\u201d said Representative Sean Casten, Democrat of Illinois. \u201cThey went over there, lived there for four years, I was born halfway through. No one ever called me an anchor baby.\u201d One of the 29, Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, was born in Canada to an American mother and Cuban father, and is considered a \u201cnatural born citizen\u201d \u2014 a status Mr. Trump questioned during the 2016 Republican presidential primaries. At the time, Mr. Cruz said Mr. Trump had \u201cjumped the shark.\u201d On Monday, he zipped toward the senators-only elevator, head down, to avoid questions. Mr. Cruz, of course, was not the first politician to have his citizenship questioned by Mr. Trump. Long before he ran for president, Mr. Trump stoked the so-called birther movement to pressure President Barack Obama to prove that he was born in the United States. This time, Mr. Trump\u2019s comments were directed at the group of Democratic freshmen known on Capitol Hill as \u201cthe Squad\u201d \u2014 Representatives Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Ayanna S. Pressley of Massachusetts. All have been deeply critical of him. Only one of the four, Ms. Omar, was born overseas; she fled war-torn Somalia with her family and spent four years in a refugee camp in Kenya before coming to the United States with her family when she was 12. In an interview in December, Ms. Omar told of how she fended off bullies in school who stuck gum on her head scarf, knocked her down stairs and jumped her when she changed clothes for gym class. On Monday, Ms. Omar fought back. \u201cThis is the agenda of white nationalists,\u201d she said, \u201cwhether it is happening in chat rooms, or it is happening on national TV, and now it\u2019s reached the White House garden.\u201d Mr. Meadows, one of the president\u2019s closest allies on Capitol Hill, pushed back, saying the real fight was over the president\u2019s policies on the border, which Ms. Omar and the others in the Squad vociferously oppose. \u201cI probably talk to him more than anybody else,\u201d Mr. Meadows said, \u201cand he\u2019s certainly not a racist.\u201d But to those lawmakers who have been bullied because of the color of their skin, like Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, Democrat of Illinois, the president\u2019s remarks were especially painful. Mr. Krishnamoorthi came to the United States when he was 3 months old. His father moved to Buffalo to study engineering, and his family lived in public housing and on food stamps before they moved to Peoria, Ill., to start, as Mr. Krishnamoorthi put it, \u201cthe golden period in our lives.\u201d \u201cPeople lifted you up and embraced you, and that\u2019s America, that will always color my image of America,\u201d he said, reflecting on his childhood. But he said racist heckles and taunts grew more prominent as he became an adult, during road rage situations in traffic and the like. \u201cI\u2019m an ethnic, religious and a racial minority, and I\u2019m an immigrant,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the president says what he says, it hits home in a bigger way.\u201d Other immigrant lawmakers \u2014 at least the Democrats \u2014 said Mr. Trump is assailing the very idea of what it means to be an American, among them Mr. Ruiz, who is the first Latino to earn three graduate degrees from Harvard. \u201cBeing American is not defined by color of skin or eyes or hair or any accent,\u201d he said. \u201cBeing American is defined by our ideas, by our diversity and by the land that we call home.\u201d",

Peters, Annie Karni and Maggie HabermanPRINT EDITIONDivisive Words Nod to Strategy For Re-election|July 17, 2019, Page A1",
      "author": "Jeremy W. Peters",
      "content": "   WASHINGTON \u2014 With three days of attacks on four liberal, minority first-term congresswomen, President Trump and the Republicans have sent the clearest signal yet that their approach to 2020 will be a racially divisive reprise of the strategy that helped Mr. Trump narrowly capture the White House in 2016. It is the kind of fight that the president relishes. He has told aides, in fact, that he is pleased with the Democratic reaction to his attacks, boasting that he is \u201cmarrying\u201d the House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the Democratic Party to the four congresswomen known as \u201cthe squad.\u201d His efforts to stoke similar cultural and racial resentments during the 2018 midterm elections with fears of marauding immigrant caravans backfired as his party lost control of the House. But he is undeterred heading into his re-election campaign, betting that he can cast the entire Democratic Party as radical and un-American. \u201cHe\u2019s framing the election as a clash of civilizations,\u201d said Charlie Sykes, a conservative writer who is critical of Mr. Trump. The argument Mr. Trump is making is both strategic and cynical, he said. \u201cThey\u2019re coming for you. They hate you. They despise America. They are not you.\u201d \u201cAnd if you look at the Electoral College map,\u201d Mr. Sykes added, \u201cthe places that will play are the places Donald Trump will need to win the election.\u201d While the Democrats were voting Tuesday to condemn the president\u2019s attacks against the four congresswomen as racist, Trump campaign officials, by contrast, were trying to cast Monday as a landmark day for the Democratic Party \u2014 the day that the progressive \u201csquad\u201d became the de facto leaders of their party. The four lawmakers \u2014 Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Ayanna S. Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan \u2014 hold no formal leadership positions in their party, and none have been on the national political stage for much longer than a year. Yet Republicans, led by Mr. Trump and buttressed by his allies in the conservative media, have spent months seizing on and distorting their more inflammatory statements. Aides to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign conceded that the president\u2019s tweets about the four women on Sunday were not helpful, were difficult to defend and caught them off guard. They would have preferred he had not tweeted that the four women, all racial and ethnic minorities, should \u201cgo back\u201d to their own countries. All four are United States citizens, and only one, Ms. Omar, was born outside the country. But they said that his instincts were what guided his campaign in 2016, when his attacks on immigrants resonated with alienated white voters in key states. They believe there is political value in having the congresswomen as the new face of their political opponents when Mr. Trump is tracing a path to re-election that runs through Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, where the four women are unpopular. Brad Parscale, the Trump campaign manager, has been telling people that it is very hard to persuade voters in the current hyperpartisan political landscape. Mr. Trump\u2019s re-election strategy, instead, is to solidify his base and increase turnout. A major component of that is to portray his opponents as not merely disliking him and his policies, but also disliking America itself. The strategy is reminiscent of how President Richard M. Nixon and the Republican Party tried to frame their fight with Democrats during the 1972 elections around questions of patriotism and loyalty. Nixon supporters took to using the slogan \u201cAmerica: Love It or Leave It\u201d to cast the Democrats and the growing opposition to the Vietnam War as anti-American \u2014 not merely anti-Nixon or anti-Republican. Pat Buchanan, the populist, conservative former presidential candidate who served as an aide to Nixon, said that by elevating the four, Mr. Trump is trying to set the terms of his re-election fight. \u201cRather than let Democrats in the primaries choose his adversary, Trump is seeking to make the selection himself,\u201d Mr. Buchanan said. And if the election is seen as a choice between Democrats like Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and Ms. Omar, Mr. Buchanan added, \u201cTrump wins.\u201d Mr. Buchanan said he envisioned a scenario in which the battle for the Democratic nomination becomes, in part, a referendum on these four women. \u201cThe Democratic candidates will be forced to choose in the coming debates as to whether to back the four,\u201d he said, \u201cor put distance between themselves and the four.\u201d Only four Republicans and one independent broke and voted with the Democrats to condemn the president\u2019s language in the House vote Tuesday, a stark reminder of just how far the party has come from the period when its leaders believed their political future depended on being a big tent, welcoming to Latino and African-American voters. Instead, a range of party leaders were pushing messages of patriotism. Some attempted to sidestep the racial implications, while others seemed less concerned about the potential blowback. \u201cForget these four,\u201d said Kellyanne Conway, the counselor to the president, in an interview with Fox News on Tuesday. \u201cThey represent a dark underbelly of people in this country,\u201d she added. \u201cWe are sick and tired of people denigrating that American flag, the American military, veterans and America.\u201d Others were jumping on the bandwagon, but seeking to reframe and soften the message. Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the third-ranking House Republican, effectively offered Mr. Trump a tutorial in how to go on the offensive without inviting a backlash. \u201cOur opposition to our socialist colleagues has absolutely nothing to do with their gender, with their religion or with their race,\u201d Ms. Cheney told reporters Tuesday. \u201cIt has to do with the content of their policies.\u201d The election is still more than 15 months away, and eventually the Democrats will have a standard-bearer to define the party in opposition to Mr. Trump. Still, some Democrats worry that criticism of the four congresswomen will resonate with a segment of their voters and independents, who may prove just as uneasy with the policies they support, and some of their rhetoric, as they are with Mr. Trump\u2019s own bombast. The Democrats who fared the best in the midterms were those who played down Mr. Trump while highlighting issues like protecting the health insurance of people with pre-existing conditions. And many of the strategists who are rallying behind former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. believe the party can\u2019t count on increasing turnout among young people and minorities, and needs to lure back voters it lost to Mr. Trump. In research published in a journal in February, Carlos Algara and Isaac Hale found that among white voters, high levels of racial resentment \u2014 measured by asking people whether they agree with statements such as \u201cI am angry that racism exists\u201d \u2014 made Democrats more likely to cross party lines when they voted. They found that there was still a sizable number of white Democrats who harbor relatively high levels of racial resentment, and that is helping Republicans across the board. Mr. Algara, a political scientist at the University of California, Davis, said that a forthcoming analysis of the 2018 midterm elections found that even without Mr. Trump on the ballot, white Democrats with high levels of racial resentment were more likely to vote for Republican candidates. \u201cThe president and the Republican National Committee know that if you prime racial resentment attitudes among Democrats, you\u2019re more likely to win their votes,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very effective strategy.\u201d But many Democrats believe that Mr. Trump has repelled so many voters who gave him the benefit of the doubt in 2016 that he is only digging himself into a deeper hole. \u201cHe\u2019s risking everything on a strategy of recreating his exact 2016 coalition, but things have changed,\u201d said Nick Gourevitch, a pollster with the Global Strategy Group, a Democratic firm. There are Trump supporters who agree that the president\u2019s rhetoric could backfire, and wish he hadn\u2019t gone down this road. \u201cI think a more successful strategy would be to focus on the growth in the economy and policies and go after moderates and independents,\u201d Anthony Scaramucci, who briefly served as White House communications director, said on CNN on Tuesday. He added that he found the comments reprehensible and was surprised that more Republicans were not speaking out. He said he found that \u201castonishing.\u201d And some Republicans believe that the president is squandering an opportunity to capitalize on what had been a smoldering fight between Ms. Pelosi and the first-term lawmakers and was simply uniting the party. \u201cIt got in the way of a nice little meltdown the Democrats were enjoying and totally unified them,\u201d said David Kochel, an Iowa-based Republican strategist. \u201cI\u2019m just concerned that he took the focus off a really interesting food fight between Pelosi and the squad.\u201d On Michael Savage\u2019s radio program on Monday, a caller named Susan dialed in to defend the president\u2019s actions. \u201cHe\u2019s said worse things than that, and he\u2019s not a racist,\u201d she said. Mr. Savage, who was one of the earliest hosts in conservative radio to endorse Mr. Trump but has been more skeptical of late, questioned his caller\u2019s blind faith and also expressed concern that the entire episode was unifying the Democrats. \u201cI\u2019m starting to get very worried about the true believers out there,\u201d Mr. Savage said, adding that he thought the president needed to stop being so impulsive. \u201cI think he needs to stop tweeting at 3 in the morning when he\u2019s having a low-blood-sugar attack. He has set our entire cause back.\u201d",

      "author": "Julie Hirschfeld Davis",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 The House voted on Tuesday to condemn as racist President Trump\u2019s attacks against four congresswomen of color, but only after the debate over the president\u2019s language devolved into a bitterly partisan brawl that showcased deep rifts over race, ethnicity and political ideology in the age of Trump. The measure, the first House rebuke of a president in more than 100 years, passed nearly along party lines, 240 to 187, after one of the most polarizing exchanges on the floor in recent times. Only four Republicans and the House\u2019s lone independent, Representative Justin Amash of Michigan, voted with all Democrats to condemn the president. [Update: House votes to kill Trump impeachment resolution.] \u201cI know racism when I see it, I know racism when I feel it, and at the highest level of government, there\u2019s no room for racism,\u201d said Representative John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia, an icon of the civil rights movement. Some Republicans were just as adamant in their defense of Mr. Trump: \u201cWhat has really happened here is that the president and his supporters have been forced to endure months of allegations of racism,\u201d said Representative Dan Meuser, Republican of Pennsylvania. \u201cThis ridiculous slander does a disservice to our nation.\u201d [Read the text of the resolution.] Republicans ground the proceedings to a halt shortly before the House was to vote on the nonbinding resolution, which calls Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets and verbal volleys \u201cracist comments that have legitimized increased fear and hatred of new Americans and people of color.\u201d It was the Democrats\u2019 response to Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks on Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Ayanna S. Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, who he said should \u201cgo back\u201d to their countries, an insult that he has continued to employ in the days since. \u201cThere\u2019s no excuse for any response to those words but a swift and strong, unified condemnation,\u201d Speaker Nancy Pelosi said as the House debated the resolution. \u201cEvery single member of this institution, Democratic and Republican, should join us in condemning the president\u2019s racist tweets.\u201d As Republicans rose to protest, Ms. Pelosi turned toward them on the House floor and picked up her speech, her voice rising as she added, \u201cTo do anything less would be a shocking rejection of our values and a shameful abdication of our oath of office to protect the American people.\u201d Representative Doug Collins of Georgia, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, made a formal objection to the remarks, charging that they had violated the rules of decorum, which call for lawmakers to avoid impugning the motives of their colleagues or the president. It was a stunning turn in a debate about Mr. Trump\u2019s own incendiary language. Mr. Trump on Tuesday denied that his tweets were racist and implored House Republicans to reject the measure. The president raged on Twitter, calling the House resolution a \u201ccon game\u201d as he renewed his harsh criticism of the congresswomen. \u201cThose Tweets were NOT Racist,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote. \u201cI don\u2019t have a Racist bone in my body! The so-called vote to be taken is a Democrat con game. Republicans should not show \u2018weakness\u2019 and fall into their trap.\u201d Late Tuesday, the president praised how the Republicans voted, tweeting, \u201cSo great to see how unified the Republican Party was on today\u2019s vote concerning statements I made about four Democrat Congresswomen.\u201d The vote was a show of unity for Democrats \u2014 who had been squabbling for weeks \u2014 and a test of Republican principles. In the end, the only Republicans to cross party lines were Representative Fred Upton of Michigan, Susan W. Brooks of Indiana, Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania and Will Hurd of Texas, the House\u2019s only black Republican. But as the debate played out, the scene devolved into a spectacle. At one point, Representative Emanuel Cleaver II, Democrat of Missouri, who was presiding in the House when Republicans challenged Ms. Pelosi\u2019s words, banged the gavel, rose from the marble dais and stormed off the floor. \u201cWe aren\u2019t ever, ever going to pass up, it seems, an opportunity to escalate, and that\u2019s what this is,\u201d Mr. Cleaver said, his voice rising in frustration. \u201cWe want to just fight.\u201d For their part, Republicans took to the floor not to defend the president\u2019s remarks but to condemn Democrats for what they called a breach of decorum. Ultimately, it was left to Representative Steny H. Hoyer, the majority leader, to recite the official ruling that Ms. Pelosi had, in fact, violated a House rule against characterizing an action as \u201cracist.\u201d The move by Republicans to have her words stricken from the record then failed along party lines, and Ms. Pelosi was unrepentant. \u201cI stand by my statement,\u201d she said as she strode through the Capitol. \u201cI\u2019m proud of the attention being called to it because what the president said was completely inappropriate.\u201d While Democrats were publicly unanimous in their support of the resolution, some moderate lawmakers from Republican-leaning districts that backed Mr. Trump in 2016 privately voiced their discomfort. They said that while the president\u2019s comments had been racist, the party was playing into his hands by spending so much time condemning his remarks, according to centrist lawmakers and senior aides who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal discussions. They were particularly angry about being asked to vote to condone Ms. Pelosi\u2019s breach of the rules, which two of them described as throwing moderate lawmakers \u201cunder the bus\u201d in order to help the speaker shore up support among progressives who had been alienated by her feud with Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and her allies. One lawmaker described the upshot of the extraordinary episode as \u201canother week burned on his terms instead of ours.\u201d The scene underscored the intensity of feeling prompted by Mr. Trump\u2019s latest comments. Republicans spent the day arguing that Democrats, particularly Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s so-called Squad, were no better. \u201cIn those tweets, I see nothing that references anybody\u2019s race \u2014 not a thing \u2014 I don\u2019t see anyone\u2019s name being referenced in the tweets, but the president\u2019s referring to people, congresswomen, who are anti-American,\u201d said Representative Sean P. Duffy, Republican of Wisconsin. \u201cAnd lo and behold, everybody in this chamber knows who he\u2019s talking about.\u201d Mr. Duffy\u2019s comments prompted an angry response from Representative Pramila Jayapal, Democrat of Washington, who sought to register an official objection. She said the use of the word \u201canti-American\u201d was \u201ccompletely inappropriate\u201d but was not allowed to formally ask to have the words stricken. At a closed-door meeting of House Democrats on Tuesday morning, Ms. Pelosi set the stage for the debate, calling the four freshman congresswomen \u201cour sisters,\u201d and saying Mr. Trump\u2019s insults echoed hurtful and offensive remarks he makes every day. \u201cSo this is a resolution based in who we are as a people, as well as a recognition of the unacceptability of what his goals were,\u201d Ms. Pelosi told Democrats, according to an aide present for the private meeting who described her remarks on condition of anonymity. \u201cThis is, I hope, one where we will get Republican support. If they can\u2019t support condemning the words of the president, well, that\u2019s a message in and of itself.\u201d A smattering of Republicans have denounced Mr. Trump\u2019s performance, including Gov. Charlie Baker of Massachusetts. The president\u2019s comments \u201cwere shameful, they were racist,\u201d he told WBUR in Boston on Monday, \u201cand they bring a tremendous amount of, sort of, disgrace to public policy and public life, and I condemn them all.\u201d But most Republican leaders refrained from criticizing Mr. Trump, at least directly, and top House Republicans lobbied their colleagues to oppose the resolution. Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the House Republican leader and a close ally of the president\u2019s, said he would oppose the measure, and when asked whether Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets were racist, he replied flatly: \u201cNo.\u201d Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, said that all politicians should dial back their rhetoric. But he did not take issue with Mr. Trump, saying that \u201cthe president\u2019s not a racist.\u201d Earlier, Mr. Trump tried to shift the focus to what he called \u201cHORRIBLE\u201d things said by the four liberal freshman congresswomen, who have been among the most outspoken in their criticisms of him. On Monday, they described Mr. Trump as racist, xenophobic, misogynistic and criminal. \u201cThis should be a vote on the filthy language, statements and lies told by the Democrat Congresswomen, who I truly believe, based on their actions, hate our Country,\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted. While some Democrats had pressed for a stronger resolution of censure, House leaders opted instead for a narrower measure based on Mr. Trump\u2019s latest remarks, in an effort to generate a unanimous vote in their party. During the meeting on Tuesday morning, Representative Jim McGovern, Democrat of Massachusetts and the chairman of the Rules Committee, warned members to take care with their language during the debate, including checking with the official in charge of enforcing floor procedures to make sure their speeches would not violate House rules against making personal references to the president on the floor. Ms. Pelosi advised Democrats to focus on how Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cwords were racist,\u201d which would keep them in compliance with the rules. Later, after Mr. Collins objected to her speech, Ms. Pelosi shot back that she had cleared them in advance to ensure they were within bounds. It is virtually unheard-of for Congress to rebuke a sitting president. The last one to be challenged was William Howard Taft, who served from 1909 to 1913. He was accused of having tried to influence a disputed Senate election, but in the end, the Senate passed a watered-down resolution and the phrase \u201cought to be severely condemned\u201d was removed. While the vote on Tuesday was symbolic and nonbinding, the debate dramatized the conflict between Democrats and a president who has organized his agenda and his re-election campaign around stoking racial controversy and casting the group of progressive stars as dangerous extremists to be feared. Among other things, the resolution declares that the House \u201cbelieves that immigrants and their descendants have made America stronger,\u201d that \u201cthose who take the oath of citizenship are every bit as American as those whose families have lived in the United States for many generations,\u201d and that the House \u201cis committed to keeping America open to those lawfully seeking refuge and asylum from violence and oppression, and those who are willing to work hard to live the American Dream, no matter their race, ethnicity, faith, or country of origin.\u201d One after another, Republicans rose to reject the criticism of Mr. Trump, arguing that it was Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and her colleagues \u2014 who have sometimes used coarse language to describe Mr. Trump and his policies \u2014 who should be rebuked and punished for their words and conduct. \u201cWhen we consider the power of this chamber to legislate for the common good,\u201d Mr. Collins said, \u201cI wonder why my colleagues have become so eager to attack the president they are willing to sacrifice the rules, precedent and the integrity of the people\u2019s house for an unprecedented vote that undercuts its very democratic processes.\u201d The Democratic unity on the vote could prove short-lived. Moments after the measure passed, Representative Al Green, Democrat of Texas, went to the House floor to reintroduce his articles of impeachment against the president. If Mr. Green can force a debate, the divisions between liberals and more moderate Democrats will almost certainly re-emerge.",

      "author": "Talya Minsberg",
      "content": " Last Friday, three days after being elected to the House of Representatives, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez invited over 600,000 people to chat as she made loaded macaroni and cheese in an Instant Pot. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat, was streaming on Instagram Live, answering questions submitted through the live chat feature as she grated cheese and sang along to Janelle Mon\u00e1e. It wasn\u2019t too surprising to see her there, as her followers have watched each step of her journey since she announced she would be seeking a congressional seat in April 2017. Over the past week, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez has taken these followers behind the scenes of congressional orientation, as she\u2019s visited monuments, met with other incoming freshmen and looked through the new member directory \u2014 which she joked was like a yearbook. \u201cAt orientation you get a swag bag,\u201d she said in one story, displaying a shopping bag that she explained held her new secure devices. In another, she walked between government buildings, whispering, \u201cGuys, there are secret underground tunnels,\u201d adding in a caption, \u201cJk they\u2019re not secret but it\u2019s cool.\u201d Government officials have always found creative ways to reach their constituents, from President Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s fireside chats to President Trump\u2019s use of Twitter. But Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, who at 29 is the youngest woman ever elected to Congress, is especially good at connecting with her followers on Instagram, which can be a more intimate platform \u2014 especially when a user speaks directly to the camera. The video quality isn\u2019t great, the audio can get muffled and the lighting can be overexposed. But that\u2019s partly the point. Using her cellphone\u2019s forward-facing camera, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez provides civics lessons and discusses her personal highs and lows. The videos seem designed to be accessible to everyone. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez has started using a closed-captioning tool called Clipomatic so that those who are deaf or hard of hearing can follow along. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez is also an active user of Twitter, the preferred clap-back platform. On Thursday, a reporter from the Washington Examiner tweeted a picture of Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s back with the caption, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you something: that jacket and coat don\u2019t look like a girl who struggles.\u201d It was one of several recent attempts by conservative media to portray her as wealthier than she says she is. He later deleted the tweet, but not before Ms. Ocasio-Cortez responded. She replied to her initial tweet with another, tagging the reporter, Eddie Scarry, and including a screenshot of his original tweet. \u201cOh, does @eScarry think he can delete his misogyny without an apology? I don\u2019t think so. You\u2019re a journalist \u2014 readers should know your bias.\u201d And she has company among her fellow incoming freshmen. After Representative-elect Ilhan Omar of Minnesota arrived in Washington this week, she tweeted, \u201cWe did not come to play,\u201d along with a link to a story in The Cut. The headline: \u201cYour Cool New Congresswomen Are Already Hanging Out.\u201d A week earlier, Ms. Omar reacted to Representative-elect Ayanna Pressley\u2019s win in Massachusetts with a Beyonc\u00e9 GIF. Like Snapchat stories, Instagram stories are ephemeral and automatically delete after 24 hours. But users can save stories and pin them to their pages as a \u201chighlight,\u201d allowing followers to watch a story weeks after it was published. Three months ago, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez made an Instagram story in which she spoke about how she was feeling. That story, labeled \u201cPep Talk,\u201d is pinned to the top of her page as a highlight. At one point, she sighed deeply and said, \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be perfect all the time on every issue.\u201d \u201cI think what people forget is if we want everyday, working-class Americans to run for office, and not like these robots, that we have to acknowledge and accept imperfection and growth and humanity in our government,\u201d she added. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez did not respond to requests for an interview. Some have dismissed her Instagram use as merely an example of a young person knowing how to use a platform. But it\u2019s not that simple, said Jennifer Grygiel, an assistant professor at Syracuse University who studies social media. \u201cVery few people can get away with wearing those animated Instagram glasses but also be taken seriously,\u201d Professor Grygiel said. \u201cShe can command both spaces.\u201d In 2018, social media skills are expected of political figures and their teams. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas is a top Instagram user among Republican politicians, with a following of nearly 280,000. But his Instagram presence is distant, filled with professional photography and text cards that do not lend themselves to a sense of authenticity. According to an analysis in The New York Times, the number of interactions on Democrats\u2019 Instagram accounts dwarfed those on Republican accounts within a 30-day period ending Oct. 15. The political tilt of Instagram reflects the demographics of the platform\u2019s users. Instagram users skew younger, as do Democratic voters. One of Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s biggest strengths on Instagram is that she tries to bring her followers into the political process and convince them that they, too, could someday be in her shoes. \u201cWhat she\u2019s saying is, \u2018Hey, develop these skills alongside of me and we will be a community, we\u2019ll be a force,\u2019\u201d Professor Grygiel said. \u201cShe\u2019s not just saying, \u2018Hey, support me, support me, support me.\u2019\u201d",

      "author": "Peter Baker",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 America stinks. At least that\u2019s what Donald J. Trump seemed to be saying before becoming president. He did not believe in \u201cAmerican exceptionalism,\u201d he said, because America was not exceptional. Instead, it was a \u201claughingstock\u201d that was no better than Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s Russia. By promising to make America great again, he made it clear that he believed it was not great anymore. That was then. Now the president who trash-talked America more than any other in modern times says anyone who trash-talks America should leave. The president, who took office with an inaugural address decrying \u201cAmerican carnage,\u201d now says that it is unpatriotic to speak ill of the country. And on Tuesday, he went further, equating attacks on him by his political opponents with attacks on \u201cthe Country, the Flag.\u201d The love-it-or-leave-it argument is hardly new, but in recent years, it has rarely played out at the volume and level it has since Mr. Trump on Sunday told a group of liberal, first-year Democratic congresswomen of color to \u201cgo back\u201d to their home countries, even though three of the four were born in the United States. Assailed for inflaming racial divisions, Mr. Trump this week sought to reframe his attack on the so-called squad of congresswomen into a question of patriotism and loyalty, claiming that they \u201chate our country.\u201d The blistering debate that has followed is all the more remarkable given that Mr. Trump spent much of the last few years essentially disparaging America. It was the high-octane fuel for his campaign, the notion that this was no longer the United States of old because it had succumbed to politically correct, multicultural, open-borders globalism and allowed itself to be taken advantage of by allies and adversaries alike. As president, however, Mr. Trump has wrapped himself in the flag \u2014 at one point hugging it at a conservative political gathering \u2014 and waged a monthslong campaign against African-American football players for protesting racism by kneeling during the national anthem. He effectively co-opted the national celebration of the Fourth of July, making himself the red-white-and-blue star on center stage. He has contended that he has transformed the United States into a beacon of strength again, crediting himself with reversing the national decline he identified as a candidate. \u201cAs president, he now sees America as an avatar for himself \u2014 it must be great because he\u2019s great,\u201d said Nicole Hemmer, a scholar of conservatism who is taking a position at Columbia University to work on its oral history of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency. \u201cFrom this perspective, to allow that America has faults would be to allow that Trump himself has them, something he has never been willing to do.\u201d In a way, this is a struggle over what the United States really stands for. Mr. Trump and his allies argue that the squad and its followers do not share core American values because they are critical of the system and advocate or flirt with socialism, while the president\u2019s critics say it\u2019s the other way around and that he does not subscribe to the core national beliefs in free speech, immigration and the rule of law. At stake is who gets to define what constitutes Americanism. There is no doubt that Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and her allies made provocative, even incendiary statements that have struck even many of their fellow Democrats as radical. Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota in particular has used anti-Semitic tropes to attack supporters of Israel and suggest Jewish lawmakers were loyal to a foreign country while making comments that seemed to minimize the horror of terrorism, even the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. The Republican National Committee on Tuesday issued a list of what it called the \u201cvile, hateful, anti-Israel and anti-American rhetoric\u201d used by Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, Ms. Omar and Representatives Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ayanna S. Pressley of Massachusetts, citing among other things comments attacking the Border Patrol and accusing the administration of running \u201cconcentration camps\u201d on the southeastern border. \u201cHe\u2019s tired, a lot of us are sick and tired of this country \u2014 of America \u2014 coming last to people who swore an oath of office,\u201d Kellyanne Conway, the president\u2019s counselor, told reporters at the White House on Tuesday. The squad\u2019s supporters argue that their comments were not anti-American but policy criticisms of an administration they disagree with, just as Mr. Trump\u2019s backers argue that his past remarks were not rejections of America but expressions of frustration with what he viewed as the damaging leadership of Mr. Obama and other presidents of both parties.

Stone, a First Amendment scholar at the University of Chicago Law School who has studied the era of McCarthyism, said criticism of the government represents one of the greatest strengths of the United States. \u201cNot all criticisms are warranted, of course, but it is through such criticism that we improve over time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was criticism that led to the civil rights movement, the women\u2019s rights movement and the gay rights movement. The president should learn to value criticism, even when he disagrees with its message.\u201d Ben Domenech, a founder and publisher of The Federalist, a conservative online publication, said the debate of recent days reminded him of a \u201cSouth Park\u201d episode where the characters say that America has problems, but anyone who does not root for the home team should get out of the stadium. \u201cThe president is doing the same thing, with an added tinge of xenophobia,\u201d said Mr. Domenech. \u201cIt\u2019s tribal, it ramps up the intensity of everything, but it plays both in his interest and the interests of the congressional members involved from their perspective.\u201d Mr. Trump was less bothered by criticism of the United States in the years leading up to his election. He repeatedly said \u201cour country is a laughingstock\u201d and took issue with the term \u201cAmerican exceptionalism.\u201d In 2013, he praised Mr. Putin for an \u201camazing\u201d Op-Ed in The New York Times that said the United States was not special and criticized Mr. Obama for asserting American exceptionalism. Speaking on CNN, Mr. Trump said, \u201cYou think of the term as being fine, but all of a sudden you say, what if you\u2019re in Germany or Japan or any one of 100 different countries? You\u2019re not going to like that term. It\u2019s very insulting, and Putin really put it to him about that.\u201d As for whether Americans were exceptional, he said, \u201cWhy would we be?\u201d citing the disastrous Iraq war. He likewise rejected the term in 2016 as a presidential candidate when asked about his praise for Mr. Putin\u2019s Op-Ed. \u201cAnd that\u2019s basically what Putin was saying, is that, you know, you use a term like \u2018American exceptionalism,\u2019 and frankly, the way our country is being treated right now by Russia and Syria and lots of other places and with all the mistakes we\u2019ve made over the years, like Iraq and so many others, it\u2019s sort of a hard term to use,\u201d he said on Fox News. During other interviews, he has said the United States was no better than Russia when it came to its moral values on the international front. During a conversation with Bill O\u2019Reilly on Fox shortly after Mr. Trump took office, the host pointed out that \u201cPutin\u2019s a killer.\u201d Mr. Trump replied by saying, \u201cWhat, do you think our country is so innocent?\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s affinity for Russia was so pronounced during the campaign that Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, now the Republican leader in the House, privately told colleagues that \u201cI think Putin pays\u201d Mr. Trump. Last year, Mr. Trump blamed poor relations with Russia on \u201cmany years of U.S. foolishness and stupidity\u201d \u2014 to which the Russian Foreign Ministry then tweeted, \u201cWe agree.\u201d Asked on Sunday to reconcile Mr. Trump\u2019s latest love-America line with his repeated assertions that America needed to be made great again, and therefore was not great, Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for the president\u2019s re-election campaign, offered a variation on the slogan: \u201cKeep America great.\u201d",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 At least 62 current federal border agents have joined private Facebook groups and other social media pages that included obscene images of Hispanic lawmakers and threats to members of Congress, internal investigators said on Monday. In all, 70 current and former Customs and Border Protection employees were identified as members of the groups, officials from the agency\u2019s Office of Professional Responsibility said. Investigators are examining inappropriate images, memes and comments in multiple Facebook groups, said Matthew Klein, a Customs and Border Protection assistant commissioner. Additional agents may be identified later, he said, as investigators continue to gather evidence. \u201cTo be clear, the expectations of professional conduct don\u2019t end at the end of the shift,\u201d Mr. Klein told journalists. \u201cThose are our expectations of our employees.\u201d Border Patrol officials will decide how to discipline current agents \u2014 which could mean losing their vacation days or losing their jobs \u2014 after they receive evidence from the internal investigators. Called \u201cI\u2019m 10-15\u201d \u2014 a law enforcement code for undocumented immigrants in custody \u2014 the first secret Facebook group was revealed two weeks ago by the investigative news site ProPublica as Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and other Democratic lawmakers toured overflowing Border Patrol facilities in Texas. The closed group included posts questioning whether a photograph of a dead migrant father and child was staged and depicting offensively doctored images of Ms. Ocasio-Cortez. Last week, The Intercept reported that Carla Provost, the Border Patrol\u2019s chief, was among the Facebook group\u2019s members. Ms. Provost condemned the posts in the group as \u201cinappropriate\u201d after it was revealed, and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez described Customs and Border Protection as a \u201crogue agency.\u201d The Democratic lawmaker last week told the House Oversight and Reform Committee that an agent tried to take a photograph of her while she toured a facility. Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York and the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, described the Facebook posts as \u201cracist and misogynist\u201d during a Monday hearing on overcrowded Border Patrol facilities. \u201cNot only did C.B.P. leadership know about this group, it now appears that the chief of the Border Patrol herself was a member,\u201d Mr. Nadler said in his opening remarks. \u201cThis is the context in which we must consider the horrific conditions in C.B.P. facilities.\u201d Talking with journalists on Monday, Mr. Klein declined to say if Ms. Provost was one of the 62 current employees identified as a member of the \u201c10-15\u201d group. Initially, the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s inspector general was asked to investigate the Facebook page, but it referred the case to Customs and Border Protection, an agency within the department. The department\u2019s acting inspector general, Jennifer L. Costello, said last week that her office would investigate whether top Customs and Border Protection officials took appropriate action against employees who were members of the social media groups. On Monday, Mr. Klein said 64 of the identified current and former agents were connected to the \u201cI\u2019m 10-15,\u201d group, which had about 9,500 members. Six others were members of at least one other group. \u201cMessages posted on a private page that are discriminatory or harassing are not protected and violate standards of conduct,\u201d Mr. Klein said. Failing to report misconduct is also a violation, he said, but he added that membership of the Facebook group alone would not automatically compel punishment. He said investigators were still examining who was active on the page and who knew about the insulting comments. From January 2016 to last month, 80 Customs and Border Protection employees have been investigated for inappropriate posts on social media websites, Mr. Klein said. Pressed on why they did not investigate the \u201c10-15\u201d group earlier, Mr. Klein said Customs and Border Protection \u201cdidn\u2019t immediately jump to the conclusion that there were other groups.\u201d In cases that were brought to the attention of internal watchdogs, \u201cwe did conduct an investigation,\u201d Mr. Klein said.",

      "author": "Zolan Kanno-Youngs",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Democratic lawmakers accused Kevin K. McAleenan, the acting secretary of homeland security, of leading an agency with an \u201cempathy deficit\u201d during a hearing on Thursday that focused on the separation of migrant children from their parents and reports of poor conditions at holding facilities near the border. \u201cWhat does that mean when a child is sitting in their own feces? Can\u2019t take a shower?\u201d said Representative Elijah E. Cummings, Democrat of Maryland, the chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee. \u201cWhat\u2019s that about? None of us would have our children in that position. They are human beings.\u201d The hearing came a week after the committee released findings of an analysis of the more than 2,600 migrant children separated from their parents last year under the Trump administration\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy, which has since been suspended. Democrats grilled Mr. McAleenan over the rollout of the policy, as well as over the discovery of a secret Facebook group for Border Patrol agents that included offensive messages, including obscene images of members of Congress. \u201cDid you see the images of officers circulating photoshopped images of my violent rape?\u201d said Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York. She also asked if the officers who had made the offensive posts in what she described as the \u201cviolent, racist group\u201d on social media were still caring for migrants at the border. Mr. McAleenan said his agents were working as hard as possible to handle a surge of migrant families, largely from Central America, and he defended the culture of the Customs and Border Protection agency. \u201cWe do not have a dehumanizing culture at C.B.P.,\u201d he said, citing the hundreds of rescues of migrants that agents have conducted  this year in the Rio Grande. \u201cThose posts are unacceptable, they\u2019re being investigated, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to apply them to the entire organization,\u201d Mr. McAleenan added. Customs and Border Protection said this week that 62 active border agents were being investigated for participating in offensive social media groups. Mr. McAleenan said Thursday that some officers had been placed on administrative duty, without specifying where they were based. He said the Department of Homeland Security has also issued cease-and-desist letters to \u201cdozens or more,\u201d but he did not describe those letters in more detail. Mr. McAleenan spent much of the more than three-hour hearing defending the care of children in Border Patrol facilities, following multiple reports that some migrants had gone for days or weeks without soap or showers in overcrowded, disease-filled detention centers. He said his agents have apprehended more than 800,000 migrants trying to enter the country since last October, pushing the agency\u2019s resources beyond capacity. \u201cAs I have testified and warned publicly dozens of times this year and last, we are facing an unprecedented crisis at the border,\u201d Mr. McAleenan said. [Read about conditions inside the migrant detention facility in Clint, Tex.] Mr. McAleenan contended that if Congress would amend immigration laws that prevent the quick deportation of Central American children and alter a federal court settlement that prohibits officials from detaining children in facilities for more than 20 days, it would ease the overcrowding and allow immigrant families to receive due process without being released into the United States. Representative Rashida Tlaib, Democrat of Michigan, said changing the court settlement would only lead to children being held in inhumane conditions for longer periods of time. \u201cJust admit that,\u201d Ms. Tlaib said. \u201cYou want to keep the kids longer.\u201d Republican members of the committee accused Democrats of making the problems at the border worse by blaming the Department of Homeland Security instead of seeking solutions. \u201cMy Democratic colleagues don\u2019t give a damn about national security or the migrants coming here,\u201d said Representative Chip Roy of Texas. \u201cThey prefer to use children as political props.\u201d Democrats also faulted Mr. McAleenan for not quickly reuniting children with their parents after President Trump rescinded the family separation policy last June in response to public backlash. The oversight panel\u2019s report found that more than 50 children were held in shelters for six months to a year, and more than 20 were held for more than a year. The report also found that at least 18 infants and toddlers younger than 2 had been separated from their parents, the youngest being 4 months old. [Read about the youngest child separated from his family at the border.] Republicans on the Oversight Committee issued a report of their own on Thursday after the Department of Health and Human Services, the agency that manages shelters for migrant children, provided them data on 1,619 of the children. The report found that 1,546 children were released to a parent or a sponsor. Even after Mr. Trump rescinded the policy, hundreds more children were separated from parents who had been flagged for fraud, disease or past criminal history, including minor violations from years in the past. Mr. McAleenan said the current separations of children from their parents were rare and \u201cundertaken in the best interest and safety and welfare of the child.\u201d He said fewer than 1,000 families have been separated since last summer. Mr. Cummings and other Democrats faulted Mr. McAleenan for the carrying out of the family separation policy and its aftermath. \u201cTragically, under Mr. McAleenan\u2019s leadership, the Trump administration failed to track separated children and their families so they could be reunited,\u201d Mr. Cummings said. \u201cThe damage the Trump administration has inflicted, and is continuing to inflict, will impact these children for the rest of their lives,\u201d he added. \u201cWhen we\u2019re dealing with children, it\u2019s not the deed, it\u2019s the memory. It is the memory that will haunt them until the day that they die.\u201d",

      "author": "Michael Crowley",
      "content": " GREENVILLE, N.C. \u2014 President Trump road-tested his attacks on four Democratic congresswomen on Wednesday, casting them as avatars of anti-American radicalism and reiterating his call for them to leave the country, as a raucous crowd chanted, \u201cSend her back! Send her back!\u201d The performance here was a preview of a slash-and-burn re-election strategy that depicts Mr. Trump as a bulwark against a \u201cdangerous, militant hard left.\u201d \u201cThese left-wing ideologues see our nation as a force for evil,\u201d Mr. Trump told a packed arena. To roaring applause, he railed against what he called \u201chate-filled extremists who are constantly trying to tear our country down.\u201d \u201cThey don\u2019t love our country,\u201d he said. \u201cI think, in some cases, they hate our country. You know what? If they don\u2019t love it, tell them to leave it.\u201d In recent days, similar comments by Mr. Trump have been met with repugnance across the country. But the capacity crowd in an arena at East Carolina University seemed to savor them. After Mr. Trump reeled off several controversial comments made by one of the four congresswomen, Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, including ones that he depicted as sympathetic to Al Qaeda, the crowd started its \u201cSend her back\u201d chant, which could become the 2020 rejoinder to 2016\u2019s \u201cLock her up!\u201d It was the latest sign that the president\u2019s plan for winning a second term in office involves playing to racial and nationalist themes that shock the consciences of many Americans, but which seem to delight his most ardent supporters. Mr. Trump doubled down with relish on his previous calls for the congresswomen \u2014 Ms. Omar, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ayanna S. Pressley of Massachusetts \u2014  to \u201cgo back\u201d to their countries of origin, even though all but one were born in the United States and all four are citizens. It left no doubt that he was undaunted by furious condemnations of his remarks as racist, including a Tuesday vote by the House. As his raucous audience booed repeatedly at his mentions of the women, the atmosphere had echoes of a pro-wrestling match at which the crowd thrills in its collective disdain for the villain of the moment. Wednesday night\u2019s event was billed as a \u201cKeep America Great\u201d rally \u2014 a boastful variant of Mr. Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign slogan, \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d \u201cBig Rally tonight in Greenville, North Carolina,\u201d the president tweeted early Wednesday, saying he would play up economic growth and the booming stock market in a state that has narrowly tilted right in the past two presidential contests. Many Republicans, including some of Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers, wish he would stick to those themes, saying they think that he is overshadowing an economic success story by engaging in name-calling and divisive cultural clashes. Some feel that his relentless focus on immigration and other nationalist themes before last November\u2019s midterm elections alienated suburban swing voters and helped enable Democrats to win the House. But while the president did devote time to the nation\u2019s recent economic growth, and took credit for data showing that China\u2019s gross domestic product is growing at its slowest rate in 27 years, he was most animated when attacking his Democratic rivals, particularly Ms. Omar, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, Ms. Tlaib and Ms. Pressley, who are collectively known as \u201cthe squad.\u201d Mr. Trump denounced Ms. Ocasio-Cortez for branding federal migrant detention centers along the southwestern border \u201cconcentration camps,\u201d saying she had, in effect, called border agents Nazis. And he recalled the way Ms. Tlaib had used what he called a \u201cvicious\u201d expletive when she vowed in January that Mr. Trump would be impeached. \u201cThat\u2019s not somebody that loves our country,\u201d the president said. Mr. Trump also ridiculed the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates, like mocking the name of Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., and saying that former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. had \u201cchoked\u201d in the last Democratic primary debate after Senator Kamala Harris of California challenged him on the issue of busing. Depicting the 2020 Democrats as a hapless and left-wing lot, Mr. Trump delivered what may have been his core pitch: \u201cTonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country. A vote for any Democrat in 2020 is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and the destruction of the American Dream \u2014 frankly, the destruction of our country.\u201d Mr. Trump also boasted about an afternoon vote in the House on a resolution to impeach him that had been introduced by Representative Al Green, Democrat of Texas. The measure, opposed by House Democratic leaders wary of a potential backlash, failed  332 to 95. \u201cWe just received an overwhelming vote against impeachment, and that is the end of it,\u201d Mr. Trump said after his arrival to the rally. \u201cLet the Democrats now go back to work.\u201d The vote did not preclude the possibility of future impeachment action. Mr. Trump first announced the rally shortly after House Democrats set Wednesday as the date for the former special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, to testify about his report on Russian election interference. That was widely seen as an effort by the president to counterprogram that testimony, which has since been delayed. During his speech on Wednesday, he only briefly mentioned the investigation, denouncing it as \u201ca hoax,\u201d and never mentioned Mr. Mueller. Mr. Trump carried North Carolina in 2016 with 49.8 percent of the vote to Hillary Clinton\u2019s 46.2 percent. The state also voted Republican, for Mitt Romney, in 2012, after Barack Obama won it narrowly in 2008. In his remarks before leaving Washington, the president responded to a question about Ms. Omar, who has faced scrutiny for filing tax records with her first husband while legally married to her second. An investigation of public records and state documents by The Minnesota Star Tribune last month could not substantiate a claim circulated online \u2014 and which Ms. Omar has denied \u2014 that her first husband was her brother, whom she allegedly married for immigration benefits. Mr. Trump accepted the opportunity to weigh in on the subject. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk about the fact that she was married to her brother,\u201d the president said, stating as fact something that is unproved. \u201cI know nothing about it,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cI\u2019m sure that somebody would be looking at that.\u201d Ms. Omar, for one, stood firm in the face of the vitriol the president and his supporters had directed at her. Shortly after Mr. Trump\u2019s rally ended, she retweeted a comment by Jon Favreau, a former speechwriter for President Barack Obama, saying that the crowd\u2019s chant of \u201cSend her back!\u201d was \u201cone of the most chilling and horrifying things I\u2019ve ever seen in politics.\u201d Above that statement, she quoted the poet Maya Angelou, writing in part: \u201cYou may kill me with your hatefulness, But still, like air, I\u2019ll rise.\u201d",

The party leadership has had enough.By Catie EdmondsonPRINT EDITIONFuror Over Ocasio-Cortez Aide Lays Bare a Deep Democratic Divide|July 15, 2019, Page A12",
      "author": "Catie Edmondson",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 House Democratic leaders, their patience clearly fraying, signaled this weekend to Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s outspoken top aide that his seeming efforts to lead an insurrection against more moderate Democrats would no longer be tolerated \u2014 a message also aimed at the freshman congresswoman who employs him. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, a liberal firebrand from the Bronx, has given her chief of staff, Saikat Chakrabarti, remarkable latitude to pursue the divisive politics that made his name when he led Justice Democrats, a group founded to challenge entrenched Democrats through primary campaigns. With that license, Mr. Chakrabarti has become an unelected symbol of the party\u2019s growing disunity, as Democrats try to coalesce as a party before what promises to be a punishing fight next year for the White House. The battle between the Democrats who secured the House majority last year by flipping Republican districts and the smaller, but politically potent, left-wing from secure Democratic districts has found its cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre. Mr. Chakrabarti ignited a firestorm two weeks ago after a bruising intraparty fight over an emergency border aid package that progressives said lacked sufficient restrictions on the Trump administration. Calling out moderate Democrats who sank a more liberal aid package, he compared them to \u201cnew Southern Democrats.\u201d They \u201ccertainly seem hell bent to do to black and brown people today what the old Southern Democrats did in the 40s,\u201d he said on Twitter. He later deleted the tweet. On Friday night, Democratic leaders showed that they had enough. Using the House Democratic Caucus\u2019s official Twitter account, they delivered a rhetorical slap that questioned not only Mr. Chakrabarti\u2019s future but also whether Ms. Ocasio-Cortez wanted to be a lawmaker on the inside or an outsider campaigning to purge the party of centrists and force it to the left. The rebuke shared a tweet by Mr. Chakrabarti that explained that he believed Representative Sharice Davids of Kansas, one of the two first Native American women to serve in Congress, was enabling a \u201cracist system\u201d in voting for a weaker border aid package. \u201cI don\u2019t think people have to be personally racist to enable a racist system,\u201d the aide had written, to which Democratic leaders demanded,\u201cWho is this guy and why is he explicitly singling out a Native American woman of color?\u201d The slap ended with, \u201cKeep her name out of your mouth.\u201d That last phrase was filled with its own meaning. It echoed a blow delivered on Tuesday to the White House adviser Kellyanne Conway by Representative Ayanna S. Pressley of Massachusetts, a member of Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s \u201csquad,\u201d who wrote, \u201cKeep my name out of your lying mouth.\u201d To further make the point, Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s deputy chief of staff, Drew Hammill, retweeted the slap. Mr. Chakrabarti, a former Silicon Valley start-up founder turned left-wing political organizer, has defiantly retained his outsider streak even after becoming a chief of staff at one of the nation\u2019s most establishment institutions, the House. That has riled ranks of Democratic lawmakers and aides. While convention on Capitol Hill holds that aides are to be seen and not heard, he has publicly and repeatedly criticized Ms. Pelosi. Perhaps most galling to lawmakers, he has also encouraged his Twitter followers to support liberal candidates trying to oust sitting Democrats, an uneasy reminder of his work with Justice Democrats. He has cultivated a remarkably high profile for a congressional aide. He \u201cisn\u2019t just running her office,\u201d a Washington Post Magazine profile of him said, \u201che\u2019s guiding a movement.\u201d A headline from Elle magazine crowed, \u201cYou Need to Know Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Chief of Snacks Saikat Chakrabarti.\u201d Mr. Chakrabarti has also remained defiant. He dismissed the rebuke from Democratic leadership Friday night, arguing that \u201cEverything I tweeted 2 weeks ago was to call out the terrible border funding bill that 90+ Dems opposed.\u201d \u201cOur Democracy is literally falling apart,\u201d Mr. Chakrabarti tweeted. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in substance-less Twitter spats.\u201d Justice Democrats, the group he founded, and over a dozen other progressive groups backed him on Saturday, releasing a statement expressing concern that \u201csenior Democratic Party leaders and their aides have been escalating attacks on new leaders in the party\u201d and urging them to focus on \u201cthe real crisis at hand\u201d at the border. The drama may be more reminiscent of a high school student council than the House of Representatives, but it has created a dilemma for Ms. Ocasio-Cortez. The progressive darling has remained silent on her aide\u2019s remarks; her spokesman declined to comment on Saturday. Asked on Thursday to comment on her aide\u2019s earlier tweets, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez replied that she had \u201cnot been paying attention to this.\u201d That is likely to further anger House members, many of whom are people of color representing moderate to conservative districts. It is considered a breach of protocol for unelected congressional aides to criticize lawmakers even in closed-door meetings \u2014 much less publicly blast out their grievances \u2014 and those who step out of line typically face consequences. As the chairman of a powerful conservative caucus, Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the No. 2 Republican, fired a top aide in 2013 after allegations that the aide had allied with conservative advocacy groups to blow up a Republican leadership budget deal. \u201cWe all rely on staff, but we have to have the full trust of our staff,\u201d Mr. Scalise said at the time. But Ms. Ocasio-Cortez prides herself on eschewing convention \u2014 an instinct that guided her ascent to become the youngest-ever elected congresswoman \u2014 and so far has extended that approach to her staff. Shortly after arriving to Capitol Hill, her legislative assistant, Dan Riffle, gave an interview in which he described fellow Democratic congressional aides as Ivy League \u201ccareerists\u201d who \u201cdon\u2019t think big and aren\u2019t here to change the world.\u201d Mr. Chakrabarti also has unloaded his grievances, sparing no one. \u201cPelosi claims we can\u2019t focus on impeachment because it\u2019s a distraction from kitchen table issues. But I\u2019d challenge you to find voters that can name a single thing House Democrats have done for their kitchen table this year,\u201d Mr. Chakrabarti wrote after the divisive vote on border aid. \u201cWhat is this legislative mastermind doing?\u201d \u201cI like to show my cards and see people\u2019s reactions,\u201d Mr. Chakrabarti told The Washington Post Magazine, echoing President Trump. But other controversies have dogged him \u2014 in part because of the outsize attention Ms. Ocasio-Cortez receives from right-wing news outlets \u2014 for a lack of forthrightness. After graduating from Harvard, Mr. Chakrabarti worked for a year as a technology associate at the hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, and then moved to Silicon Valley to help found the technology company Stripe. He is presumed to be rich, but has not filed a financial disclosure form, leadership aides say. Because Ms. Ocasio-Cortez capped her senior aides\u2019 salaries to ensure she could offer an entry-level wage of $52,000, her employees are below the income threshold that mandates public financial disclosure. Instead, a House ethics panel required her to compel at least one of her aides who can \u201cact in the member\u2019s name or with the member\u2019s authority\u201d to file a disclosure form. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez chose Mr. Riffle, the legislative assistant, to submit the disclosure, rather than Mr. Chakrabarti. In March, a conservative group filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission saying that Mr. Chakrabarti improperly disclosed the spending of two political action committees he helped establish that paid more than $1 million in 2016 and 2017 to a company he ran. The company, Brand New Congress L.L.C., was an arm of a group he helped found by the same name that recruited community organizers as candidates who would all adopt the same transformative progressive platform; in turn, the group would contract their staff out to help run the candidates\u2019 campaigns. To do this, Brand New Congress argued, the group had to be set up as a limited liability company \u2014 which is not required to disclose information about its owners or spending. A lawyer for the company has said that Mr. Chakrabarti never received any salary or profit from the company, the political action committees or the campaign, and that the move was legal.",

But what does it mean to be a socialist \u2014 and to what degree do Democrats fit the definition?By Reid J. Epstein and Linda QiuPRINT EDITIONAttaching Democrats to Radical Socialists|July 21, 2019, Page A19",
      "author": "Reid J. Epstein",
      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump has made branding Democrats as out-of-the-mainstream, economy-wrecking socialists one of the centerpieces of his re-election strategy. He has sought to do so partly by making four junior Democratic members of Congress \u2014 all women of color who are on the left side of the party\u2019s ideological spectrum \u2014 the faces of the party, and conflating their views with the Democrats seeking their party\u2019s presidential nomination. It is a message he has repeated with varying degrees of intensity and accuracy for weeks. And while a few of his fellow Republicans have expressed unease about how he has framed his scathing criticism of one of those four Democrats \u2014 Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, who was born in Somalia and immigrated to the United States as a refugee \u2014 as a call for her to \u201cgo back\u201d to her native country, Republicans have embraced the president\u2019s broader efforts to cast Democrats as socialists. How much truth is there to Mr. Trump\u2019s characterization of the Democratic Party? Here is a fact check. First things first: All Democrats are not socialists. Most Democrats are not socialists. Of the 24 candidates for president, only Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont identifies himself as a democratic socialist. (Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, one of the four House members the president has taken to trashing, rose to fame after running on a democratic socialist platform.) The rest of the presidential field has rejected the socialism label. While in many cases their policy positions are well to the left of where the party was just a few years ago, that development has other prominent Democrats concerned. Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado and former Representative John Delaney of Maryland are arguing that the Democratic Party cannot be defined by a candidate who embraces socialism. Even Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who is the most ideologically aligned with Mr. Sanders among the 2020 contenders, says she is not a socialist. When she is asked about the difference between her and Mr. Sanders, her stock answer has been that she is \u201ca capitalist to my bones.\u201d It is true that every Democratic presidential candidate vying to replace Mr. Trump has called for increasing the federal commitment to health care, education and the environment, among other proposals. Those plans would generally require substantially more government spending, higher taxes, an increased public-sector role in private markets and a reversal of the deregulatory push championed by Mr. Trump. While the Democratic agenda is consistent with policies the party has pursued for decades, some proposals from the more left-leaning candidates would be more far-reaching than the party\u2019s platform in the past several election cycles. The proposal supported by some of the 2020 candidates to eliminate private health insurance would be a clear turn to the left, and calls for policies like a wealth tax are unapologetically redistributionist at a time of growing inequality. But Mr. Trump has hardly produced an Ayn Rand meritocracy during his presidency. In May, the Agriculture Department said it would give $16 billion in aid to farmers hurt by Mr. Trump\u2019s trade war with China. Farmers in the Midwest \u2014 particularly in Iowa, home of the nation\u2019s first presidential nominating contest \u2014 have said the funds do not come close to matching income they have lost because of falling commodity prices that followed China\u2019s retaliatory tariffs. And Mr. Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans have long advocated various government giveaways to corporations, which Mr. Sanders and others have deemed \u201ccorporate socialism.\u201d Putting aside the fact that it is called the Democratic Party and stipulating that it is impossible to disprove a rumor that Mr. Trump may or may not have heard, no, the Democrats are not changing their name to the Socialist Party. And there are few similarities between what Democrats are proposing and the types of outcomes Mr. Trump tries to link them to, especially when he invokes Venezuela and its economic and humanitarian crisis as a warning that socialism is a harbinger of catastrophe. There are, of course, very different strains of socialism. To an immigrant from Cuba or Venezuela who fled countries with centrally planned economies and neighborhood spies who inform on dissenters to the government, socialism means a very different thing than to Mr. Sanders, who envisions a northern European-style social safety net that drastically increases public spending on health care, education and environmental protection. On economic issues, Democrats in the United States are far to the right of the governing parties in most other western democracies. Canada and Britain, for instance, have single-payer universal health care systems that are politically sacrosanct, even among their mainstream conservative parties. Northern European governments \u2014 Denmark, Norway and Sweden \u2014 subsidize far more of their citizens\u2019 lives and tax income at far higher rates than have been proposed by Mr. Sanders, the self-described democratic socialist. The Nordic countries \u2014 with their high tax rates and generous social benefits \u2014 are often cited as examples by Mr. Sanders and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez as models to emulate. Tax revenue made up more than 40 percent of the gross domestic product in Denmark, Sweden and Finland, for example, in 2017, compared with 27.1 percent for the United States. That revenue finances child care, basic and advanced education, health care and care for the countries\u2019 older residents. The slew of programs many Democratic candidates have supported \u2014 universal health care, affordable child care, and higher education and a higher minimum wage \u2014 are more accurately labeled proposals of social democrats rather than socialists, said Peter Dreier, a professor at Occidental College and scholar of the left. But \u201cnobody has a plan to take government ownership of the means of production,\u201d he said, referring to the dictionary definition of socialism. \u201cNobody\u2019s talking about the government taking over Microsoft or Walmart or Wells Fargo or Disney.\u201d Some of the Democratic plans \u2014 especially when it comes to health care \u2014 would entail substantial changes in the way the economy operates now. Mr. Sanders, Ms. Warren and Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York, for example, would eliminate private health insurance entirely, putting all Americans in a government-run system. Other proposals would be very expensive. Mr. Sanders wants to eliminate the student debt of nearly 45 million graduates and eliminate tuition and fees at public four-year institutions and community colleges. He estimates the cost at $2.2 trillion, to be paid for with a tax on financial transactions. The big unknown when it comes to cost is health care. The Congressional Budget Office was asked this year to look at the costs of \u201cMedicare for all\u201d programs like the one advocated by Mr. Sanders. \u201cGovernment spending on health care would increase substantially,\u201d the report said, but it declined to provide any specific estimates because of the wide range of options about how such a plan would work. Studies of plans like the one promoted by Mr. Sanders have concluded that patients would spend far less on health care than they do now, and the government would spend far more, presumably requiring higher taxes. For some people, any tax increase might be more than offset by reductions in their spending on premiums, co-payments and other health care costs. But others could end up paying more in new taxes than they save. Mr. Sanders and other Democrats make the point that Americans already pay far more for health care than people in other countries but often get inferior care. There is some evidence that more Americans are open to socialism. A Gallup poll released in May found that 43 percent of Americans believe socialism is a \u201cgood thing\u201d for the country, as opposed to 51 percent who said it was a \u201cbad thing.\u201d In 1942, the split was 25 percent saying it was a good thing compared to 40 percent saying bad thing \u2014 a spread that was twice as large as it is now. Trying to frame policy proposals that expand the social safety net as socialism is a time-honored tradition in Republican politics, one intended more to motivate Republican voters to turn out than to change minds among Democrats. Ronald Reagan began his political career calling Medicare \u201csocialized medicine\u201d that would doom the country. The Republican campaign to block the Affordable Care Act, before and since it was enacted, has consisted largely of suggesting it represents the creep of socialism into the country\u2019s health care system. But Mr. Trump won election in 2016 after promising to maintain the Medicare system and replace the Affordable Care Act with a health care law that would cover all Americans.",

      "content": "  PORT HURON, Mich. \u2014 As President Trump presses his attacks against four women of color in Congress, suggesting they are unpatriotic and should leave the country, many voters in this city on Lake Huron are embracing his \u201cAmerica \u2014 Love It or Leave It\u201d message, saying they do not see it as racist. And though they dismiss Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter broadsides as excessive or juvenile, they voiced strong support for his re-election and expressed their own misgivings about the four women. \u201cThey happen to be black or colored,\u201d Dennis Kovach, 82, said of the women, as he watered the lawn of his home near the lake this weekend. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think that viewpoint is a racist viewpoint. I think it\u2019s \u2014 quit the bitching, if you don\u2019t like it, do something different about it.\u201d Tim Marzolf, 57, sitting on a nearby porch on one of the hottest days of July, had a similar view, saying he had been turned off since Day 1 by Representative Rashida Tlaib, the Palestinian-American lawmaker from Detroit who is one of the women the president has attacked. \u201cSomething struck me wrong,\u201d said Mr. Marzolf, a factory worker, referring to Ms. Tlaib\u2019s call for Mr. Trump\u2019s impeachment. \u201cShe got elected and came out with the F-word on Trump.\u201d As Mr. Trump signaled his intent last week to rely on nationalism and identity politics to propel his re-election campaign \u2014 portraying Democrats as out of sync with American values \u2014 his message did not appear to be backfiring with the conservative voters he hopes to bring out in force in 2020. In this overwhelmingly white district an hour north of Detroit, where his popularity remains high, his comments left people in the familiar position of having to choose a side in the aftermath of another Trump-instigated outrage. And they chose his. Mr. Trump carried St. Clair County, an auto parts manufacturing center on the Canadian border, with 63 percent of the vote in 2016, cementing a narrow statewide victory and Michigan\u2019s crucial 16 electoral votes. The margin of victory \u2014 less than 11,000 votes \u2014 was his slimmest in any state. [Falling trust in government makes it harder to solve problems, Americans say] Michigan is an important piece of Mr. Trump\u2019s path to re-election and is already the focus of some of the Republican Party\u2019s most extensive get-out-the-vote efforts. On Friday, the state party and the Trump campaign kicked off what one party official described in an email to supporters as \u201cthe largest and most robust ground game Michigan has ever seen.\u201d In truth, Michigan could be one of the purest laboratories to test a central paradox of the president\u2019s re-election strategy: To win while he remains widely unpopular \u2014 his approval rating is consistently less than 50 percent in national opinion polls \u2014 voters don\u2019t need to like him as much as they need to dislike the Democratic nominee. And as his actions over the last week have shown, he is trying to ensure that happens, by inflicting as much damage as he possibly can to the Democrats\u2019 brand. In Port Huron, many residents said they were willing to ignore Mr. Trump\u2019s outbursts, pointing to strong hiring in local factories as evidence he was doing a good job. Some raised fears about a move toward socialism within the Democratic Party, and suggested that Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks might even gain him support by showcasing just how far left the Democratic Party has shifted. The racial divisiveness of his attacks seemed to be pushed to the side. Fred Miller, the Democratic clerk of nearby Macomb County, a national bellwether that voted twice for Barack Obama but then flipped to Mr. Trump, attributes the lack of outrage to a cultural disconnect over the way many people define racism. \u201cWhen some people rightfully call out Trump for these offensive, disgusting comments, I think a lot of other people see themselves in Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cThey may not have a college degree, they might not speak about race in P.C. terms, but they don\u2019t think they\u2019re racists.\u201d So when the president \u201cturns around and says, \u2018I\u2019m not racist,\u2019\u201d Mr. Miller added, \u201cI think there are a lot of people who think they don\u2019t have a racist bone in their body either. And Trump gets that.\u201d Democrats are seeing clear signs in their own research that the president is not as weak politically as he might appear. Last week, lawmakers were presented with the findings of a new poll that looked at sentiment in counties like Macomb that switched from Mr. Obama to Mr. Trump. The poll, commissioned by the progressive campaign finance reform organization End Citizens United, found that a generic Democratic presidential candidate beats Mr. Trump by only 2 points in these counties, 48 percent to 46 percent. Even so, Representative Paul Mitchell, the conservative Republican who represents the Port Huron area, struck a note of caution. \u201cI do believe this strategy will be damaging to this election,\u201d Mr. Mitchell said in a telephone interview. He has asked for a meeting with the president, hoping to add his voice to other Republicans who have urged Mr. Trump to restrain himself. All of the women whom Mr. Trump told to \u201cgo back\u201d to their countries \u2014 Ms. Tlaib and Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Ayanna S. Pressley of Massachusetts \u2014 are United States citizens, and only one, Ms. Omar, was born outside the country, in Somalia. [The conservative radio host Michael Savage is skeptical about President Trump. But his audience isn\u2019t.] \u201cI was appalled by the chanting \u2018send her back,\u2019\u201d Mr. Mitchell said of the crowd at Mr. Trump\u2019s rally Wednesday in North Carolina, where the chant was directed at Ms. Omar. For Mr. Mitchell, the message struck close to home. \u201cMy youngest son was born in Russia,\u201d he said. \u201cWe adopted him. He\u2019s an American.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks on the congresswomen \u2014 he renewed them Sunday with a Twitter post saying they were not capable of loving America, and again on Monday when he called them \u201ca very Racist group of troublemakers\u2019\u2019 \u2014 could also hurt him by motivating black voters and increasing their turnout. At Port Huron\u2019s St. Paul African Methodist Episcopal Church, the Rev. Sandra J. Woodard was preparing for the church\u2019s 100th anniversary. \u201cWhat I can say is that the comments are certainly not something that a person who has feelings for others would make, particularly a president who is supposed to be representing all people,\u201d Ms. Woodard said. Mr. Trump\u2019s strength in 2016 was \u2014 and remains \u2014 largely dependent on how he fared against a widely mistrusted opponent. Roughly 75,000 voters in Michigan did not vote for president at all but did vote in races further down ballot, suggesting that there were enough Michiganders who found both candidates so unappealing that their absence helped put Mr. Trump over the edge. There are some cautionary signs for his 2020 campaign, a prognosis reflected anecdotally and in Republicans\u2019 private polling in Michigan. When the president is matched against a Democratic opponent like Joseph R. Biden Jr. or Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, he loses. Crucially, he has not reached 50 percent in any polls taken in Michigan, a perilous position for any incumbent. [Which Democrats are leading the 2020 presidential race this week?] But the version of the Democratic Party that voters here are seeing is also unpopular, as the two dozen presidential candidates debate issues that seem antithetical to their concerns \u2014 like decriminalizing illegal border crossings and offering Medicaid to undocumented immigrants. \u201cI hear it all the time from other people who say: \u2018I\u2019m a Republican. I didn\u2019t vote for him, but I don\u2019t see how I can\u2019t this time,\u2019\u201d said Greg McNeilly, a Republican strategist from Western Michigan, a party stronghold. \u201cPeople have become desensitized to his conduct. And now, given where Democrats are landing on policy, I think that is really frightening people.\u201d The state has some sentimental value for the president as one he was not expected to win, and Republicans on the ground are taking nothing for granted. \u201cOur team is out in the field as we speak conducting trainings, activating volunteers, registering voters and communicating directly with the people of our state,\u201d said a memo circulated to party insiders on Friday, which called the 2020 race \u201cone of the most critical elections of our lifetime.\u201d Representative Debbie Dingell, a Michigan Democrat whose district is a potpourri of partisanship, stretching from the liberal redoubt of Ann Arbor to the industrial communities south of Detroit, said in an interview that her party cannot afford to be lulled into complacency by the president\u2019s low approval ratings. \u201cPeople are engaged earlier than I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d said Ms. Dingell, one of the few Democrats who warned the Clinton campaign in 2016 that Mr. Trump was stronger than he appeared in the state. \u201cAnd if I had to guess, I\u2019d say most people have made up their minds.\u201d Now, she added, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t make a prediction about how the election is going to go.\u201d Saul Anuzis, a former state Republican Party chairman, said that while the president was mostly energizing his base by attacking the four women, the Democrats\u2019 shift to the left could also work to Mr. Trump\u2019s advantage among swing voters in 2020. The congresswomen \u201cvery much represent the loony left, from my perspective,\u201d he said, \u201cand I think mainstream Democrats don\u2019t necessarily agree with these folks.\u201d On Saturday, Port Huron staged its biggest party weekend of the year, with a street festival and an annual boat race to Mackinac Island. Several downtown workers, partygoers and sunbathers said they feared what might happen if Mr. Trump lost. \u201cPeople get upset about what he says, but he\u2019s still doing his job,\u201d said Catherine Plichta, 63, an Air Force veteran, as she ate lunch on Huron Avenue. \u201cI voted for him and I\u2019m going to vote for him again. He supports veterans.\u201d Eric Hayden, a retired food service director, had plastered his Facebook page with criticism of the four freshmen congresswomen. \u201cThose women are a little extreme,\u201d Mr. Hayden, 54, said as he was leaving his home for a cocktail party at the yacht club. \u201cThey\u2019re actually doing Trump a favor every time they open their mouth. Anti-Israel, for starters. That\u2019s not a good thing. The other is, you know, just their programs. I paid back my student debt.\u201d Sitting outside their cottage as a giant ship navigated the lake nearby, Les and Michelle Smith also said they had supported Mr. Trump and would do so again, despite reservations. Ms. Smith, 54, a certified medical assistant, said she was worried about what would happen with immigration if the Democrats take over. \u201cWe\u2019re letting too many people in,\u201d she said. For his part, Mr. Kovach, watering his lawn by the lake, said he did not see a viable presidential option in 2016 so he did not vote for either candidate. Since then, he has come around to Mr. Trump. \u201cI think the economy has done very well since he\u2019s been in office,\u201d Mr. Kovach said. Asked about the Democrats, he said he once worked in a factory in Romania where he had observed the Communist system. \u201cNo thanks,\u201d he said.",

      "content": " CONCORD, N.H. \u2014 Tensions between Joseph R. Biden Jr. and other Democrats over his stance on climate change have escalated this week, after Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez lashed out at \u201cmiddle ground\u201d approaches to the issue in a thinly veiled criticism of the former vice president. Her comments prompted a rebuke on Tuesday from Mr. Biden, who said in response to a question that she should \u201clook at my record\u201d as he once again defended himself against accusations from within his party that he would adopt too moderate a position on an urgent global problem. The dispute represents a striking display of the divisions between the center and the left of the Democratic Party, embodied in the quintessential Beltway veteran, Mr. Biden, and the progressive newcomer, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez. Mr. Biden has been under fire from his party\u2019s left flank, including from Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and several of his presidential rivals, after a Reuters report last week in which Mr. Biden was described as seeking a middle ground to combat climate change. His campaign has said the report mischaracterized his position, and on Tuesday morning he directly answered some of the criticism. \u201cYou\u2019ve never heard me say \u2018middle of the road,\u2019 I\u2019ve never been middle of the road on the environment,\u201d Mr. Biden said when asked to respond to comments Ms. Ocasio-Cortez issued the night before. \u201cAnd, tell her to check, you know, the statement that I made and look at my record, she\u2019ll find that nobody has been more consistent about taking on the environment and the green revolution than I have.\u201d Those remarks came in response to a reporter who read aloud some of Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s comments, which she made Monday night at a rally in support of a sweeping environmental proposal known as the Green New Deal. After listing a series of past abuses related to the environment, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez issued what was widely interpreted as an indictment of Mr. Biden. \u201cI will be damned if the same politicians who refused to act then are going to try to come back today and say we need a middle-of-the-road approach to save our lives,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is too much for me.\u201d In style and on many policy issues, Mr. Biden is campaigning as a centrist in a sprawling field that features a number of candidates from the progressive left, who are advocating substantive change. He said recently that he did not believe the Democratic electorate had moved as far left as many in the party assume. During his New Hampshire swing this week, Mr. Biden pledged to release more details on his environmental proposals by the end of the month, and detailed his record on combating climate change dating to the 1980s. He also spent time, both in conversations with reporters and unprompted on the stump, casting himself as a longtime champion of the environment and defending his record on climate change, a key issue to many progressive voters. Pressed on whether his future policies would be sufficiently bold for progressives, Mr. Biden expressed confidence: \u201cYeah I do, I do,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a long campaign,\u201d he went on. \u201cAnd everybody should, they should calm down a little bit. Take a look at the record. There\u2019s nothing middle-of-the-road about my efforts dealing with the environment. Nothing.\u201d",

      "content": " Two police officers in Gretna, La., were fired on Monday, four days after one of them referred to Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as a \u201cvile idiot\u201d on social media and suggested that she should be shot. Chief Arthur Lawson of the Gretna Police Department announced the terminations, saying that Charles Rispoli, the officer who wrote the Facebook post, and Angelo Varisco, who liked the post online, had violated the department\u2019s social media policy. \u201cThis incident, we feel, has been an embarrassment to our department,\u201d Chief Lawson said at a news conference. \u201cThese officers have certainly acted in a manner which was unprofessional, alluding to a violent act to be conducted against a sitting U.S. congressman, a member of our government. We\u2019re not going to tolerate that.\u201d Mr. Rispoli, a 14-year veteran of the Police Department, said in a Facebook post on Thursday that Ms. Ocasio-Cortez \u201cneeds a round \u2014 and I don\u2019t mean the kind she used to serve,\u201d a reference to her past work as a bartender, according to a screenshot of the comment obtained by The Times-Picayune of New Orleans. Mr. Varisco joined the department in 2016. In the screenshot, his name can be seen as one of four who reacted to the post, either with a laughing face emoji or a thumbs-up. Neither Mr. Rispoli nor Mr. Varisco could be reached for comment on Monday evening. \u201cI applaud the investigation,\u201d Belinda Constant, the mayor of Gretna, said in an interview. \u201cI think it was done appropriately, it was done expeditiously, and it absolutely was the right decision.\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York, is a self-described democratic socialist and has been a strong critic of President Trump. She is one of four first-year female Democrats in the House \u2014 three of whom were born in the United States \u2014 who were told by Mr. Trump to \u201cgo back\u201d to their countries in a Twitter post last week. A representative of Ms. Ocasio-Cortez declined to comment on Monday night. Chief Lawson said he had trouble understanding Mr. Rispoli\u2019s post, especially since the article he shared \u2014 which claimed that Ms. Ocasio-Cortez had said soldiers were paid too much \u2014 was satirical. \u201cI think he just got caught up in the heat of the moment,\u201d Chief Lawson said. \u201cAnd this wasn\u2019t even a real news article.\u201d Neither officer had patrolled the streets, Chief Lawson said. He said Mr. Varisco had provided security for the courts, and Mr. Rispoli had also worked in the courts before he began supervising \u201cindividuals who were in the home incarceration program.\u201d The action against the officers in Louisiana came at a time of increased scrutiny of police officers\u2019 activity on social media. Last month, researchers with the Plain View Project released a compilation of troubling posts made by public safety officers. They examined eight police departments across the country and found that \u2014 of the Facebook profiles they could verify \u2014 about one in five current officers, including many in supervisory roles, and more than two in five former officers used content that was misogynist, racist, Islamophobic or otherwise biased, or that undermined the concept of due process. The project spawned investigations and repercussions in Philadelphia, Phoenix, St. Louis and elsewhere. Chief Lawson said that Gretna police officers had been trained and made aware of other episodes across the country in which officials had gotten into trouble for inappropriate social media posts. \u201cWith all of those efforts, something like this still happens,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s very disturbing. It certainly shows a lack of the officers paying attention to what\u2019s going on in the world around them.\u201d",

PetersPRINT EDITIONNancy Who? The Right Finds New Liberal Foils In 4 Young Firebrands|July 28, 2019, Page A20",
      "author": "Jeremy W. Peters",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 When Mark Sanford was running for a South Carolina House seat in 2013 and wanted to make a point about the brand of liberalism he would fight in Washington, he staged a mock debate with a life-size picture of Nancy Pelosi, which his campaign staff had custom made at a local copy shop. Today, for $64.95, anyone who wants to make a political prop out of Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the Republican Party\u2019s newest antagonist, can buy a 5-foot-6 cardboard cutout of her at Walmart\u2019s online store. After barely eight months in office, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and three other progressive women of color have reached a level of notoriety that is virtually unheard-of for freshman House members, largely thanks to the kind of relentless conservative fire usually trained on far more senior Democrats. Ms. Pelosi, the House speaker whose \u201cSan Francisco values\u201d were the focus of tens of millions of dollars and nearly a decade\u2019s worth of Republican attacks, is Public Enemy No. 1 no more. Even Hillary Clinton, who inspired President Trump\u2019s crowds to thunder \u201cLock her up!\u201d or Barack Obama, whose ethnic background drew false speculation about his citizenship and religion, are no longer inspiring the kind of vitriol the right has leveled at the four women. Led by Mr. Trump, Republicans have used the four congresswomen, known as \u201cthe squad\u201d \u2014 Ms. Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan \u2014 as a visual aid for the nationalist, us-versus-them message he seems eager to pursue for the 2020 election. Their attacks on the congresswomen, with only a handful of dissenters, show how broadly accepted Mr. Trump\u2019s racial and cultural instigations have become in the Republican Party. \u201cPolitics is supposed to be about ideas,\u201d said Mr. Sanford, who won that election with the mock Pelosi debate in 2013 and served in the House until 2019 after losing to a more pro-Trump Republican in a primary. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve now done is to take it to another level, which is to say to some extent it\u2019s about ideas, but it\u2019s about personality more.\u201d \u201cI never said Nancy Pelosi didn\u2019t love America,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s where some of this has been taken to levels that are dangerous.\u201d Mr. Trump has done little to discourage the demonization, and the attacks have metastasized. His Twitter harangue that the women should \u201cgo back\u201d to where they came from \u2014 though all are citizens and all but one, Ms. Omar, were born in the United States \u2014 turned into chants of \u201csend her back\u201d at a recent Trump rally. Those kinds of sentiments have multiplied on social media, which has exploded with memes in recent days calling the four everything from terrorists to harpies to cancer. The president has also had plenty of support from the conservative media. From Fox News, where Tucker Carlson has lent credence to unproven claims that Ms. Omar once married her brother, to the talk show host Rush Limbaugh, who for months has introduced Ms. Ocasio-Cortez by enunciating each syllable of her name with a mimicked Spanish accent, many conservatives depict the four women in a way that recalls how they questioned Mr. Obama\u2019s loyalties and background. Speaking on Mr. Carlson\u2019s show this week, a guest claimed, \u201cWe\u2019re not even sure Omar is her real name.\u201d These portrayals have filtered down to the average pro-Trump, anti-liberal voter and activist. At a party for the Conservative Political Action Conference outside Washington in February, people defaced a cardboard cutout of Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, scribbling \u201cstupid\u201d in vulgar Spanish slang on her face. Recently, the Facebook account of the Illinois Republican County Chairmen\u2019s Association posted a doctored image of the four that called them \u201cThe Jihad Squad.\u201d Ms. Pressley, who is black, was Photoshopped with a pistol in her hand. The association later took down the image and apologized, saying that the posting was not authorized. Public opinion polls show that significantly more Americans view the four women unfavorably than favorably \u2014 a remarkable level of infamy for any House member to reach after less than a year on the job. While it is not unusual for partisans to move on to fresh targets, the four women have less power, fewer achievements and lower national profiles than past Republican targets like Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton. None are seeking the presidency, or even a leadership position in the House. Whether the vilification has damaged the Democratic Party as a whole is unclear, as is whether these attacks will have staying power once the Democrats choose their presidential nominee next year \u2014 and there is an actual face to put on the party. Mr. Trump is convinced it will help him, said people who have spoken to him in recent days. And he rejected those who have told him otherwise, responding with certitude, \u201cYou\u2019re wrong.\u201d Joshua Ulibarri, a partner at the Democratic research firm Lake Research Partners, said that his party would be wise to assess what Mr. Trump is really trying to accomplish \u2014 rally the faithful while also converting nonvoters who are inclined to be sympathetic to his nationalistic appeals. \u201cThey know our side is coming out,\u201d Mr. Ulibarri said. But what Mr. Trump has failed to take into account, he added, is that the squad \u201chas motived our base, especially young women and people of color.\u201d He recommended that Democrats harness that energy to avoid the low turnout of minority voters that hurt them in 2016. \u201cFor us to not promote that means we haven\u2019t learned our lesson,\u201d he said. But Democrats would risk losing voters who are not as progressive if Americans believe that the four House Democrats and their call for sweeping change on issues like immigration and health care \u2014 dismantling the Department of Homeland Security, for instance, as Ms. Ocasio-Cortez recently suggested \u2014 represent the party as a whole. Democratic strategists conceded that their candidates have had a hard time getting traction because of the outsize place Mr. Trump occupies in the media. \u201cThe media attention is driven by whatever Trump is talking about \u2014 and that\u2019s what people hear, that\u2019s what filters down, \u201d said Tresa Undem, a partner with the research firm PerryUndem, who has been surveying likely Democratic primary voters in recent weeks. \u201cOn any given issue they know nothing about it unless Trump has had a take on it at some point, and the media has covered it on a sustained basis,\u201d she added. \u201cAnything else doesn\u2019t break through.\u201d Months before Mr. Trump started tweeting about the four \u2014 telling them to \u201cgo back\u201d if they did not like America and calling them racist, weak, anti-American and \u201cnot very smart\u201d \u2014 conservatives had been watching them closely and covering their public remarks with an intensity that far surpassed the coverage that most of the two dozen Democratic candidates for president were receiving. The congresswomen sometimes did themselves no favors. Ms. Omar, who is Muslim, was heavily criticized after making comments that were widely condemned as anti-Semitic. Her statements and tweets, including one that pro-Israel activists were pushing \u201cfor allegiance to a foreign country,\u201d led the House to pass a resolution in March that condemned \u201chateful expressions of intolerance,\u201d by an overwhelming 407-to-23 vote. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s identification as a democratic socialist, and her huge profile on social media, made her catnip for the right. She became a national media sensation after her stunning upset of a white male Democrat who had represented her district for nearly two decades. But the mentions of her in right-leaning media \u2014 hardly ever presented in a flattering light \u2014 proliferated after she led the public relations efforts behind the Democrats\u2019 Green New Deal, a progressive proposal to fight climate change. No member of Congress in memory had made such a splash so fast. Most Americans had never heard of or had no opinion about senators like Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Elizabeth Warren a year and a half into their first terms, according to Gallup. But after only two months on the job, most Americans said they knew Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, Gallup reported. But by then, more people already had an unfavorable impression than a positive one, polls showed. After Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s office published talking points that contained an aside about getting rid of \u201cfarting cows and airplanes,\u201d conservatives pounced, incorrectly claiming that Democrats would end commercial aviation and stop beef production. But with Mr. Trump and others pushing such sensational claims, the Green New Deal gained in notoriety. One recent poll conducted by the Democratic Global Strategy Group found that 69 percent of Fox News-watching Republicans had heard about the proposal, compared with just 33 percent of Democrats. All of this is reminiscent of the way Republicans started hammering Ms. Pelosi in 2010 because of her role in getting the Affordable Care Act passed. The time and money spent reminding voters of comments she made about the bill \u2014 she once said Congress needed to pass it so that Americans could see what was in it \u2014 helped Republicans put a public face on Democratic leadership. And it belonged to someone who happened to be from the city that inspires some of the most cartoonish portrayals of liberals, San Francisco. Republicans took back the House that year, deposing Ms. Pelosi as speaker. They kept vilifying her with some success in congressional elections for the next eight years, driving her approval rating below 30 percent at times and holding on to their House majority. But by 2018, the attacks were no longer working as well. When Democrats took control of the House in last year\u2019s elections, more voters were galvanized by and preoccupied with another unpopular leader: Mr. Trump.",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Six days after Democrats swept to power in the House, a quartet of newly elected women of color met in Washington for the first time. Somebody snapped a picture, and one of them \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez \u2014 posted it on Instagram with a one-word caption: \u201cSquad.\u201d Today, that foursome \u2014 Representatives Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ayanna S. Pressley of Massachusetts, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan \u2014 may be Washington\u2019s best-known political clique. But their forceful brand of progressive politics and command of the spotlight rankles some fellow Democrats, including the most important Democrat in Washington: Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who on Friday appeared to make peace with Ms. Ocasio-Cortez \u2014 at least for now. \u201cIn a family, you have your differences, but you\u2019re still family,\u201d Ms. Pelosi told reporters after the two met privately for 30 minutes, at Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s request. She acknowledged \u201csome personality issues\u201d in the caucus, but called them \u201cminor.\u201d Lionized by the liberal left and vilified by President Trump \u2014 who is waging a relentless campaign to attack them as anti-American \u2014 Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and the others roared into Washington in January as part of the most diverse freshman class in American history, and quickly emerged as a proxy for the debate over the future of the Democratic Party, exposing its ideological and generational divisions. Tensions between the quartet and Ms. Pelosi erupted into public view this month amid a fight over humanitarian aid to the border. The women blasted the aid package as insufficient and voted against it. Ms. Pelosi dismissed them as \u201cfour people\u201d who \u201cdidn\u2019t have any following.\u201d Then Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and her chief of staff, Saikat Chakrabarti, took shots at the speaker on Twitter \u2014 a stunning breach of protocol for a young lawmaker and an unelected aide. Ms. Omar infuriated many veteran Democrats this year with remarks many deemed anti-Semitic. Ms. Tlaib took the party off course on Day 1 with her off-color promise to impeach Mr. Trump. But fences are being mended. Ms. Omar is joining Ms. Pelosi on an official trip next week to Ghana. Ms. Tlaib appeared at a fund-raiser with Ms. Pelosi over the weekend; when the speaker was in Detroit on Monday, she was greeted by protesters chanting, \u201cSupport the squad!\u201d They do not always vote the same way. Ms. Pressley broke with the others this week to vote for a resolution condemning the boycott Israel movement. Just two of them \u2014 Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and Ms. Tlaib \u2014 voted for a two-year spending package that passed on Thursday. But people close to the women say they have forged genuine friendships and a close bond. They communicate regularly via a private text chain, as do their chiefs of staff and their communications directors. On occasion, their offices plot strategy together and coordinate media appearances, including a joint news conference last week and an interview with Gayle King of CBS News to push back against Mr. Trump. All declined interviews for this article. \u201cWhat we are, are four women who have an alignment of values, shared policy priorities, who have repeatedly happened to land in the same place on the issue of immigration,\u201d Ms. Pressley, who keeps the lowest profile of the four, told Ms. King. \u201cThat is it. There is no insurgency here. There\u2019s nothing conspiratorial.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks \u2014 in a tweet this month he told the women to \u201cgo back\u201d to their home countries, even though only one of them, Ms. Omar, a Somali refugee, was born outside the United States \u2014 prompted Democrats to rally around them. The House voted to condemn the president\u2019s comments as racist, and even moderates like Representative C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger, a centrist from Maryland who had trouble remembering Ms. Omar\u2019s name, stood behind them. \u201cI said, \u2018Look, you don\u2019t know me; we\u2019ve only met once or twice,\u201d Mr. Ruppersberger said, recounting a conversation with Ms. Omar after Mr. Trump\u2019s tweet. \u201cBut I can tell you this: \u2018I\u2019m behind you 100 percent.\u2019\u201d Still, Mr. Ruppersberger said he and other moderates were wary of the women, fearing they would push primary challengers to run against them. And while progressives view the four as some of the most exciting figures in the Democratic Party, they did not make a good impression with some of their more senior colleagues when they showed up for work in January. \u201cI think when the new generation comes in, sometimes they don\u2019t understand what it is to be in the majority,\u201d Mr. Ruppersberger said. All four landed in Washington as firsts. Ms. Pressley, 45, a former member of the Boston City Council, is the first black woman to represent Massachusetts; Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, 29, a former bartender and onetime organizer for Senator Bernie Sanders, is the youngest woman ever elected to Congress and the first Latina to represent her district. Ms. Omar, 36, is a former state legislator and the first woman to wear a hijab on the House floor. She and Ms. Tlaib, 43, a lawyer and former state legislator who is of Palestinian descent, are the first two Muslim women in Congress. Both have been the subject of fierce criticism for their views on Israel. The four are the only freshmen elected with the backing of Justice Democrats, a grass-roots organizing group that burst onto the scene last year after helping Ms. Ocasio-Cortez with her stunning primary defeat of Joe Crowley, the No. 4 Democratic leader. During the campaign, some of them connected through social media, and after Ms. Ocasio-Cortez won her primary, she helped the others. \u201cThese are four women of color who speak truth to power, who do not want to maintain the status quo and are going to fight like hell, like they have nothing to lose, for the biggest solutions to some of our biggest problems,\u201d Alexandra Rojas, Justice Democrats\u2019s executive director, said in an interview. \u201cThey are all doing exactly what they said they were going to be doing on the campaign trail.\u201d Although the four women share political ideology, they also came together in part because of happenstance. A bipartisan group called VoteRunLead, which trains women to run for office and was meeting in New York, asked the women to sit for a joint Facebook Live interview when they were in Washington after the 2018 midterm elections, when the photo posted on Instagram of them was taken. VoteRunLead\u2019s founder, Erin Vilardi, said she would have included another progressive woman of color \u2014 Representative Lauren Underwood of Illinois \u2014 in the interview, had Ms. Underwood been available at that hour. \u201cThe four of them are unique, and I would include Lauren Underwood in that,\u201d Ms. Vilardi said. \u201cThey\u2019re challenging norms on leadership and what it means to be a strong leader.\u201d Moderates are not the only Democrats who bristle at the women \u2014 or at least the group that backs them. Some veteran members of the Congressional Black Caucus railed against Justice Democrats \u2014 and by implication, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and her chief of staff, Mr. Chakrabarti, who founded it \u2014 in an article in The Hill newspaper. Two senior Democratic aides, both speaking on the condition of anonymity, said several Democratic lawmakers have urged Ms. Ocasio-Cortez to dismiss Mr. Chakrabarti, arguing that his outspokenness is undermining her. Mr. Chakrabarti, who is on paternity leave, did not respond to a request for comment; nor did a spokesman for Ms. Ocasio-Cortez. Waleed Shahid, the Justice Democrats\u2019s communications director, showed no signs of tempering his criticism. On Friday afternoon, as Capitol Hill talked of rapprochement, he used Twitter to talk up conflict: \u201cI don\u2019t understand the aversion to conflict and vague calls for \u2018unity\u2019 on the Hill. Of course, there will be conflict between someone who primaried the 4th ranking House Democrat, participated in a sit-in at @SpeakerPelosi\u2019s office, & encouraged more people to run in primaries.\u201d The foursome\u2019s one unquestionable good for the party is fund-raising; Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, for instance, has already raised $2 million this cycle. But with Mr. Trump determined to make the women the face of the party, some Democrats say they need to tone it down \u2014 or at least be more careful with their words. \u201cThey have been thrust into the middle of a debate about the heart and soul of this country, and that does carry with it a unique set of responsibilities,\u201d said Representative Tom Malinowski, a centrist Democrat from New Jersey. \u201cHe has now put them in a very special position. It would be my hope that all of us, wherever we fall on the ideological spectrum, will advance our agenda while embracing in every possible way the patriotism that we share with all of our fellow Americans.\u201d",

      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Two of Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s top aides who were instrumental in forging her unexpected path to victory last year are leaving Capitol Hill, less than a month after one of them ignited a firestorm by challenging Speaker Nancy Pelosi and comparing moderate House Democrats to segregationists. House Democrats had been privately calling for the ouster of Saikat Chakrabarti, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s embattled chief of staff. He and Corbin Trent, her communications director, had gone to Capitol Hill determined to wage their confrontational brand of progressive politics forged as leaders of Justice Democrats, a group dedicated to unseating entrenched Democratic lawmakers through primary campaigns. Justice Democrats helped Ms. Ocasio-Cortez sweep to power with the defeat of a veteran House Democrat, Joseph Crowley. But less than a year later, after a bruising skirmish this summer with Democratic leadership, both are calling it quits, they told The Intercept on Friday. Their departures will be seen as Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s most tangible peace offering since her private meeting last week with Ms. Pelosi. Mr. Chakrabarti \u201chas decided to leave the office of Representative Ocasio-Cortez to work with New Consensus to further develop plans for a Green New Deal,\u201d Mr. Trent told The Intercept, referring to the congresswoman\u2019s ambitious climate change program. \u201cWe are extraordinarily grateful for his service to advance a bold agenda and improve the lives of the people in\u201d New York\u2019s 14th District. The New Consensus is a liberal nonprofit organization dedicated to developing and promoting the Green New Deal. Mr. Trent will return to working on Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s campaign. Mr. Chakrabarti, intent on continuing his anti-establishment movement from inside the halls of power, had rankled lawmakers and aides on Capitol Hill after he posted on Twitter his support for liberal candidates trying to topple sitting Democrats and his disdain for Ms. Pelosi\u2019s legislative prowess. His challenges to elected leaders were considered in Congress to be remarkable breaches of protocol from an unelected aide. His position became untenable last month after he compared moderate Democrats who sank a liberal emergency border aid package to \u201cnew Southern Democrats.\u201d They \u201ccertainly seem hell bent to do to black and brown people today what the old Southern Democrats did in the 40s,\u201d he tweeted. He later deleted the post, but the damage was done. In an extraordinary effort to crack down on the chief of staff, Democratic leaders leveraged the House Democratic Caucus\u2019s official Twitter account to resurrect a tweet by Mr. Chakrabarti that said that he believed Representative Sharice Davids of Kansas, one of the first two Native American women to serve in Congress, was enabling a \u201cracist system\u201d in voting for a weaker border aid package. \u201cWho is this guy and why is he explicitly singling out a Native American woman of color?\u201d House Democratic leaders asked on Twitter. Democratic lawmakers, meanwhile, privately implored Ms. Ocasio-Cortez to fire Mr. Chakrabarti to wipe the slate clean.",

      "author": "Matt Stevens",
      "content": " Senator Mitch McConnell\u2019s re-election campaign regained access to its Twitter account on Friday, days after getting locked out for posting a tweet that Twitter had flagged as inappropriate. The tweet, which the campaign sent Tuesday out of its @Team_Mitch account, included a video of people making violent threats against the majority leader in front of his Louisville, Ky., home. In text accompanying the video, the campaign labeled the protesters as an \u201cangry left-wing mob.\u201d Twitter hid the tweet and locked the campaign out of the account on the basis that the tweet \u2014 with the video embedded \u2014 contained a threat and had violated the platform\u2019s \u201cabusive behavior policy.\u201d That left Mr. McConnell\u2019s team in the unusual position of being locked out of its account for posting a video of a threat that had been made against Mr. McConnell. The campaign appealed largely on those grounds, arguing that its intent had been \u201cto highlight the threats for public discussion,\u201d Twitter said in a statement on Friday. \u201cWe have reviewed this case more closely,\u201d the Twitter statement said. \u201cGoing forward, the video will be visible on the service with a sensitive media interstitial and only in cases where the Tweet content does not otherwise violate the Twitter Rules.\u201d As of Friday afternoon, the tweet in question was visible once again. \u201cVictory!!!\u201d the account tweeted. \u201cThank you to EVERYONE for helping #FreeMitch.\u201d The dispute over the account was first reported by The Louisville Courier-Journal. The Twitter lockout added to a turbulent week for Mr. McConnell\u2019s campaign, which drew criticism after two separate episodes involving social media, and for Mr. McConnell himself. The majority leader is recovering from a fractured shoulder and has been under pressure from Democrats and some Republicans to bring up gun control legislation in the Senate in the wake of two mass shootings that killed more than 30 people and injured dozens more. In the radio interview on Thursday, Mr. McConnell expressed a new willingness to allow the Senate to consider a measure expanding background checks for gun purchasers when lawmakers returned in September. Critics of Mr. McConnell\u2019s longtime inaction on gun control pilloried him on Twitter this week using the hashtag #MassacreMitch. That was a twist on the #MoscowMitch moniker his adversaries had developed a week earlier to chastise him for blocking election security legislation. In the video that prompted the Twitter lockout, a protester can be heard using expletives to describe the senator and suggesting that rather than injure his shoulder, Mr. McConnell \u201cshould have broken\u201d his neck. She also muses that someone or something should be stabbed in the heart. After it was shut out of its account, Mr. McConnell\u2019s campaign and some of his supporters complained vigorously that Twitter\u2019s move had set a double standard on what kind of speech was allowed. By Thursday afternoon, officials from the Republican National Committee and the National Republican Senatorial Committee entered the fray, saying they would forgo buying new ads on Twitter until it unfroze the Team Mitch account. And by late Thursday, Mr. McConnell declared to WHAS radio in Louisville that he and his team were \u201cin a major war\u201d with Twitter and had not given up their fight. Having apparently won that fight, Kevin Golden, Mr. McConnell\u2019s campaign manager, said Friday that he and his team were pleased that Twitter had \u201creversed their decision.\u201d \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t have taken an avalanche of outrage from across the country to stop Silicon Valley from launching an effort to silence conservatives like the majority leader of the United States Senate in the first place,\u201d Mr. Golden said in a statement. The other Twitter turmoil involving Mr. McConnell began over the weekend when the Team Mitch account posted a photo of a mock graveyard filled with faux tombs marked with the names of people and policies Mr. McConnell has opposed. (Mr. McConnell, who is running for re-election in 2020, has sometimes cast himself as the \u201cgrim reaper\u201d for liberal legislation.) One of the tombstones was labeled \u201cAmy McGrath\u201d and dated Nov. 3, 2020, which is Election Day. Ms. McGrath, a Democrat and retired Marine, is challenging Mr. McConnell for his Senate seat. She criticized him for posting the photo soon after the shooting in El Paso on Saturday, and said she found it \u201ctroubling that our politics have become so nasty and personal that the Senate majority leader thinks it\u2019s appropriate to use imagery of the death of a political opponent (me) as messaging.\u201d Then on Monday, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York, reposted a photo of a group of young men wearing \u201cTeam Mitch\u201d T-shirts clustered around a cardboard cutout of her. One of the young men had his hand at the cutout\u2019s neck, while another appeared to be going in for a kiss. \u201cAre you paying for young men to practice groping & choking members of Congress w/ your payroll, or is this just the standard culture of #TeamMitch?\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez wrote in her tweet to Mr. McConnell. In a series of statements, Mr. Golden said the young men were high school students and not campaign staff members, and added that \u201cTeam Mitch in no way condones any aggressive, suggestive or demeaning act toward life-size cardboard cutouts of any gender.\u201d As for the faux graveyard, he said supporters had \u201cbuilt a homage\u201d to an editorial cartoon that appeared in The Lexington Herald-Leader earlier this year. \u201cThis is the problem with the speech police in America today,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Lexington Herald can attack Mitch with cartoon tombstones of his opponents, but we can\u2019t mock it.\u201d",

      "content": " A Facebook post by a Louisiana police officer suggesting that Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez \u201cneeds a round\u201d drew criticism on Sunday from officials in the city where he works. The officer, Charlie Rispoli, a 14-year veteran of the police department in Gretna, La., referred to Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York, in a post on Thursday as \u201cthis vile idiot.\u201d The post continued, saying she \u201cneeds a round \u2014 and I don\u2019t mean the kind she used to serve,\u201d a reference to her past work as a bartender, according to a screenshot of his comment obtained by The Times-Picayune of New Orleans. He was responding to a post by the satirical website tatersgonnatate.com with the headline \u201cOcasio-Cortez on the Budget: \u2018We Pay Soldiers Too Much.\u2019\u201d Wayne Rau, a city councilman and the mayor pro tem of Gretna, a city of about 18,000 people across the Mississippi River from New Orleans, condemned Officer Rispoli\u2019s post in an interview on Sunday. \u201cI\u2019m pretty appalled by it,\u201d Mr. Rau said. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is a representation of the police department of the city of Gretna.\u201d Asked whether Officer Rispoli\u2019s Facebook post was a threat, he said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure how to take that post.\u201d He said it should be up to the city\u2019s police chief, Arthur Lawson, to decide on any disciplinary or criminal action. In addition to Mr. Rau, there are four other members on the Gretna City Council. Three were not immediately available for comment on Sunday. The fourth, Jackie Berthelot, directed questions to the Police Department. Efforts on Sunday to reach Officer Rispoli, who appeared to have deactivated his Facebook account, were unsuccessful. Corbin Trent, a spokesman for Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, declined to comment. Chief Lawson, who is an elected official, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Sunday. The chief told The Times-Picayune that he was disturbed by the post. \u201cI will tell you this: This will not go unchecked,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to take this lightly and this will be dealt with on our end. It\u2019s not something we want someone that\u2019s affiliated with our department to make these types of statements. That\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d The chief said that the post appeared to violate the department\u2019s social media policy but that he did not think it rose to the level of being a threat. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez is part of a quartet of first-year Democrats in the House known as \u201cthe squad\u201d who have received death threats and were told by President Trump to \u201cgo back where you came from\u201d in a racially charged post on Twitter. Belinda Constant, the mayor of Gretna, said on Sunday that she had been out of the state and was not immediately prepared to comment. \u201cI will be looking into the situation,\u201d Ms. Constant, a Democrat, said. Eva Malecki, a spokeswoman for the United States Capitol Police, declined to say whether the agency was investigating. \u201cThe mission of the United States Capitol Police is to protect and serve Congress,\u201d she said. \u201cHowever, we do not discuss how we carry out our protective responsibilities.\u201d The four congresswomen were also the subject of a recent Facebook post by the Republican County Chairmen\u2019s Association of Illinois, which depicted them in a mock movie poster that referred to them as the \u201cjihad squad.\u201d \u201cPolitical Jihad is their game,\u201d said the post, which was published on Friday and later deleted. \u201cIf you don\u2019t agree with their socialist ideology you\u2019re racist.\u201d It showed Representatives Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Ayanna S. Pressley of Massachusetts brandishing guns. On Sunday night, the state\u2019s Republican Party chairman, Tim Schneider, issued a statement disavowing the post, which he said did not reflect the party\u2019s values. \u201cBigoted rhetoric greatly distracts from legitimate and important policy debates and further divides our nation,\u201d Mr. Schneider said, adding, \u201cI urge everyone who opposes them to keep the rhetoric focused on policy and ideology.\u201d",

      "author": "Lisa Friedman",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Senator Kamala Harris of California and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York on Monday unveiled legislation aimed at ensuring that climate change plans benefit low-income communities. They described the measure as a key element of the Democrats\u2019 Green New Deal. The effort comes as Ms. Harris, who is running for president, and other Democratic candidates prepare for a set of debates in Detroit this week. Racial and economic disparities on issues ranging from housing to education are expected to take center stage. [Follow our coverage of the next Democratic primary debates.] Ms. Harris, who has yet to release a comprehensive climate change plan of her own, has focused much of her economic agenda on providing tax credits and other assistance to low- and middle-income Americans. This month, she and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez introduced a bill designed to help people with criminal records obtain housing. The new proposal, titled the Climate Equity Act, provides a view of Ms. Harris\u2019s environmental priorities. Under the plan, any environmental regulation or legislation would be rated based on its impact on low-income communities, which are disproportionately affected by climate change because they are often in flood zones, near highways or power plants, or adjacent to polluted lands known as brownfields. The rating system would be modeled after the Congressional Budget Office score, which measures the costs of every major piece of legislation. \u201cWe can\u2019t do anything without a C.B.O. score, but we never actually consider if it\u2019s disastrous to communities as long as it\u2019s revenue-neutral,\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said in an interview. The bill would also establish an independent Office of Climate and Environmental Justice Accountability to represent vulnerable communities, and create a position of senior adviser on climate justice at \u201call relevant agencies.\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez was the primary House sponsor of the Green New Deal, a nonbinding resolution that set out a broad vision for significantly reducing planet-warming pollution by 2030 while also guaranteeing millions of new jobs. She said low-income workers were often ignored in the climate discussion. \u201cOne of the tenets of the Green New Deal is prioritizing vulnerable communities,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to talk about Flint. We have to talk about West Virginia. We have to talk about the Bronx and we have to talk about the ways climate change manifests in our lives.\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said that she had not endorsed anyone in the presidential race and noted that she had worked with various candidates on different aspects of the climate challenge. Climate change analysts said they were encouraged by the bill, and by the fact that several presidential candidates had recently made issues of equity more central to their discussions of the environment. Many of the candidates\u2019 early plans for tackling global warming focused almost entirely on methods of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, including by establishing a price on carbon dioxide, eliminating coal-fired power plants and investing billions of dollars in clean energy technologies. But in another example of the growing focus on economic and racial disparities, Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington released the final plank of a five-part global warming plan on Monday, aimed at new federal policies to prioritize low-income areas and communities of color. Mr. Inslee, who has made climate change the top issue of his presidential campaign, also called for a way to score, or screen, federal environmental decisions and proposed a new office dedicated to environmental justice. Tom Steyer, the billionaire former hedge fund investor who also is running for president, last week released his own \u201cjustice-centered\u201d five-pillar plan for tackling climate change focused on protecting low-income communities. The new plans \u201csend an important signal,\u201d said Mustafa Ali, who ran the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s environmental justice office under the Obama administration. \u201cThey are timely and they are needed,\u201d he said, \u201cand they help us to begin to think critically about the steps that are going to be necessary to protect people\u2019s lives in the moment, and in these challenges that are rushing at us at a very quick pace.\u201d The candidates are making equity a top issue in other arenas. This month Ms. Harris has introduced a $100 billion housing plan to help black families and individuals buy homes in historically redlined communities, and a $75 billion initiative to invest in minority-owned businesses and historically black colleges. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts has called for an executive order requiring recipients of federal contracts to diversify their workforces. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey has proposed creating savings accounts for every child born in the United States. Ms. Harris also released her health care plan on Monday, proposing a system that would provide Medicare for all Americans but allow people to choose private plans modeled on Medicare Advantage. Ms. Harris\u2019s campaign said her full climate plan was forthcoming. But in a statement, Ms. Harris said she believed it was important to address equity even before nailing down the specifics of how to curb carbon emissions. \u201cWe cannot accept a status quo where children of color are drinking toxic water in Flint or breathing toxic air in Louisiana\u2019s Cancer Alley,\u201d she said. \u201cThis systemic environmental injustice will only get worse and become more ingrained if climate and environmental policies like the Green New Deal do not specifically focus on lifting up these communities.\u201d",

      "author": "Emily Cochrane",
      "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 On the first day of the 116th Congress, the strident cry of a first-term lawmaker encapsulated the fervor of the progressive left for impeaching President Trump. In a late-night speech to activists in early January, Representative Rashida Tlaib, Democrat of Michigan, promised, \u201cWe\u2019re going to impeach the\u201d president, referring to Mr. Trump with an expletive. More than eight months later, a cascade of carefully worded statements from moderate freshmen in Republican-leaning districts proved a crucial pivot point that helped drive House Democrats to officially begin an impeachment inquiry. Sixty-four Democrats were elected last year \u2014 the most ideologically and culturally diverse class in history \u2014 and since coming to Washington in January, the freshmen have personified the two poles of a divided caucus in the impeachment debate. Now the progressives who have long clamored for Mr. Trump\u2019s removal and the moderates who stubbornly resisted it have come together around the idea that it is time to pursue an impeachment inquiry. The rare bit of unity has given leverage to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has privately advised some of the freshmen about the most effective way to make their voices heard, as she undertakes a process that could bring down a president. And balancing their competing interests as the House moves ahead could prove a steep challenge. Top Democrats say it is no accident that Ms. Pelosi\u2019s head-spinning turn from opposing an impeachment inquiry to calling for one came less than 24 hours after seven first-term moderates, including military veterans and two former C.I.A. officers, embraced the idea in the opinion pages of The Washington Post on Monday night. Other moderate freshmen followed with their own carefully drafted statements. Most had strongly resisted impeachment and some have tough re-election races. \u201cIt caused other colleagues to change their minds and it signaled the gravity of the moment,\u201d said Representative David Cicilline, of Rhode Island, a member of the Democratic leadership. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a coincidence that all these events happened together. As they began to call for it, it created, really, a dam breaking in our caucus.\u201d That has created a new atmosphere in the Capitol, where the moderates have spent months ducking reporter\u2019s impeachment questions, often refusing to mention the word. Eclipsed in the media by liberals like Ms. Tlaib and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, they are now taking their turn in the spotlight, forthright about their views on and off camera. \u201cI support the inquiry, and I think the transcript that came out, it\u2019s plain for anyone to see, it shows the president of the United States, both explicitly and implicitly asking a foreign leader to dig up dirt on a political opponent,\u201d declared Representative Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, a former C.I.A. analyst and one of the authors of the op-ed. \u201cThat can\u2019t be O.K.\u201d Ms. Slotkin was referring to a transcript released on Wednesday of Mr. Trump\u2019s call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, which has been at the center of the impeachment discussion. It showed that Mr. Trump repeatedly asked Mr. Zelensky to investigate one of the American president\u2019s rivals, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. Constituting roughly a quarter of the Democratic caucus, the freshmen are a microcosm of the broader group. They span the philosophical spectrum, including Ms. Tlaib of Michigan on the left, and Representative Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey \u2014 who on Wednesday echoed some of the arguments Republican leaders are making against impeachment \u2014 on the right. \u201cWe\u2019re fundamentally different folks, right, we\u2019re generally not career politicians, we\u2019re generally people that haven\u2019t been spending our lives within political systems trying to get here to Washington,\u201d said Representative Jason Crow, Democrat of Colorado and one of the seven writers behind the op-ed. \u201cBecause we come from different backgrounds, we have a unique ability right now to change culture and approach things in a very different way.\u201d Ms. Pelosi is paying especially close attention to the more than 40 freshmen who flipped Republican seats \u2014 many, but not all, in districts won by Mr. Trump. The House Republican campaign arm has reveled in the new enthusiasm for impeachment, flooding the airwaves with statements claiming that because the moderates have \u201ccaved to the impeachment-obsessed base,\u201d their political careers are over. The few Democrats who oppose impeachment, like Mr. Van Drew, can ill afford to take a vote on the House floor on whether to open an impeachment inquiry, and Ms. Pelosi does not plan to hold one, according to lawmakers and senior party officials, even though that is what Republicans did in 1998 when they opened an inquiry into President Bill Clinton. Mr. Van Drew said he has been raising that issue in calls to the speaker\u2019s office. \u201cI asked, \u2018Do you absolutely need a vote for the impeachment inquiry, for the inquiry alone?\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cAnd nobody has gotten me that information.\u201d Instead, the House voted Wednesday on a resolution demanding access to a whistle-blower complaint about Ukraine, and condemning Mr. Trump and his administration for refusing to turn it over to Congress. Hours before the vote, they did. Others, like Ms. Slotkin, are urging Ms. Pelosi to narrow the impeachment inquiry to Ukraine, and focus it tightly on national security \u2014 a message that would presumably go over well in their Trump-friendly districts. Were she to do so, the speaker might anger powerful committee chairmen who are investigating other aspects of the Trump administration. \u201cThe speaker has given each of us the freedom to come to whatever conclusion we have on our own, based on our own beliefs and our own districts,\u201d said Representative Angie Craig, who flipped a Republican seat in Minnesota. \u201cThis is one of the toughest decisions that any member of Congress will have to make \u2014 and it\u2019s not something I ever wanted to have to do.\u201d For centrists like Ms. Craig, there is clearly political peril in coming out in favor of impeachment. Only a few, including Representative Antonio Delgado, Democrat of New York, directly called for articles of impeachment over the allegations surrounding the call. Many did so with statements aimed at their constituents. Representative Haley Stevens of Michigan, one of two presidents of the freshman class, was among those who wrestled with the decision. \u201cIt\u2019s not political,\u201d she said. \u201cMy goal wasn\u2019t to move the narrative, but to speak to the gravity of the situation.\u201d At the same time, the tables have flipped for Ms. Pelosi when it comes to the liberal wing of her caucus. For months, progressive freshmen like Ms. Tlaib \u2014 a member of the foursome of freshmen women who dub themselves \u201cthe squad\u201d \u2014 have been pressuring the speaker to move on impeachment. Now, she has done what they wanted. \u201cTime\u2019s up,\u201d Ms. Tlaib declared happily on Tuesday, after Ms. Pelosi\u2019s announcement, adding, \u201cI guess it took this major action, a criminal action by the president, for a lot of my colleagues to understand. We\u2019re moving forward and I\u2019m very pleased.\u201d Veteran Democrats agree that, as a class, the freshmen have outsized power \u2014 in part because there are so many of them. Representative Jim McGovern of Massachusetts, chairman of the House Rules Committee, said that when he was a freshman, nobody paid attention to him. \u201cWhen they speak,\u201d Mr. McGovern said, \u201ceverybody listens.\u201d Ms. Pelosi meets monthly with the freshmen as a class, and meets with smaller groups as various issues crop up. She spoke with the seven national security lawmakers on Monday at about 5 p.m., several hours before their opinion piece posted. Representative Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, one of the authors, said Ms. Pelosi was not told about the op-ed until it was \u201calready in the hands\u201d of editors at The Post. But the speaker was pleased to have it, those close to her say, and she was spotted reading it Tuesday morning on a plane from New York to Washington. The freshmen were short, and to the point, and hinted at their past reluctance, declaring, \u201cWe do not arrive at this conclusion lightly.\u201d The op-ed, coupled with the other statements, caught other, more veteran Democrats by surprise. Representative Mark Takano of California, chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, said he was especially caught off guard when he saw that Representative Elaine Luria, a low-profile Democrat from Virginia, was one of the authors. \u201cElaine\u2019s from a very tough district,\u201d Mr. Takano said. \u201cMy reaction when I heard Elaine had done that was, \u2018Oh my god, wow, this is really a watershed moment.\u2019 \u201d",

      "author": "Emily Cochrane",
      "content": " RHINEBECK, N.Y. \u2014 Even before Peter Plavchan Sr. asked about \u201cthe exact crimes\u201d President Trump had committed to prompt his congressman to reverse course and embrace an impeachment inquiry, Representative Antonio Delgado was ready with a detailed answer. \u201cWe are literally about to embark on something that has not happened all that often in our country\u2019s history,\u201d Mr. Delgado, Democrat of New York, told Mr. Plavchan and other constituents last week in his opening remarks at a town hall-style meeting in his district. Pressed further, his voice began growing hoarse as he explained, at length, the allegations about Mr. Trump\u2019s pressure campaign on Ukraine. \u201cI\u2019m endeavoring, in this space, to the best of my ability, to do whatever I can to not just fan the flame, but to figure out how to bring us through this process in a way that can very least help us emerge better for it,\u201d Mr. Delgado said. It is a difficult balance to strike, with Washington in a partisan frenzy over an impeachment inquiry that expands by the day as new revelations about Mr. Trump\u2019s conduct pour out, but much of the nation is still divided over \u2014 or simply uninterested in \u2014 a process that could result in the removal of the president. Here in this politically competitive district in the Hudson Valley, which Mr. Delgado flipped last year to Democrat from Republican as part of his party\u2019s sweep to power in the House of Representatives, voters have yet to be consumed with the impeachment fever gripping the capital, and some are downright sick of the topic already. \u201cAntonio, I can\u2019t quite say you represent me,\u201d declared Mr. Plavchan, who wore a red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat and an American flag earring, from the front row of Mr. Delgado\u2019s town hall-style meeting. More than 100 miles south on Staten Island, Representative Max Rose, another Democrat representing a conservative-leaning district, used a gathering last week with his constituents at a Jewish community center to declare his support for the impeachment inquiry. He was greeted with a hearty round of applause as he surrendered his status as one of his party\u2019s last holdouts. Across the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge in Queens the following evening, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez \u2014 the progressive star who was one of her party\u2019s first and most zealous champions of impeaching Mr. Trump \u2014 elicited chuckles last week when she informed her constituents gathered in a public library that, with a formal inquiry finally underway, \u201cI\u2019m over it.\u201d The conversations that unfolded in these Democratic town hall-style meetings, with a diverse group of three freshman lawmakers in three distinct enclaves of New York, reflected the broader dialogue happening across the country. Lawmakers, who are home in their districts for a two-week congressional recess, are confronting the delicate job of explaining their stances on the impeachment process, while still addressing voters\u2019 more immediate concerns about issues like health care, climate change and infrastructure. From Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s liberal urban stronghold to Mr. Delgado\u2019s rural district, many voters appeared to be more interested in talking about regional issues than about high crimes and misdemeanors. And the lawmakers worked to make it clear that they, too, had more on their minds than the potential removal of Mr. Trump. \u201cImpeachment of this president is the short-term action that we need to take to preserve our democracy,\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said, preparing to show her audience a PowerPoint presentation on her latest policy initiative. \u201cBut if we are really going to thrive as a country, we need to make long-term investments and keep our eyes on the prize of social, economic and racial justice in America.\u201d When a New Jersey woman interrupted the event to question Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s reasoning on impeachment, the freshman lawmaker calmly observed that \u201cyou and I clearly have different takeaways,\u201d and encouraged attendees to read the documents released by the White House and draw their own conclusions. But pressed on her public disagreements with other Democrats, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez assured those present that, \u201cin this moment, there is nothing that is going to shake the unity of the Democratic Party in impeaching the president of the United States.\u201d Party leaders had rebuffed calls to postpone congressional recess, arguing that even amid an avalanche of support for the inquiry, it was important for lawmakers to return home and explain their positions. The House Republican campaign arm heralded each event in moderate or conservative-leaning districts with an \u201cimpeachment advisory,\u201d a warning sign for Democrats who were already well aware of the risk of an impeachment backlash from their constituents. After Mr. Rose\u2019s announcement on Wednesday, a spokesman for the National Republican Campaign Committee deemed his backing for an impeachment investigation \u201cpolitical suicide.\u201d Voters at each lawmaker\u2019s event last week professed some knowledge of the impeachment obsession that has gripped Washington in recent days, and particularly at Mr. Rose\u2019s town hall-style meeting, there was widespread curiosity about what had prompted a turnabout in favor of opening the inquiry. But the three lawmakers each faced more questions about their policy platforms and how they were going to maneuver legislation through a gridlocked Congress. Carol A. Oliva, a retired elementary schoolteacher who had been keeping track of which lawmakers had endorsed an impeachment inquiry, said it was no mystery to her why her congressman, Mr. Rose, had stayed silent for so long. \u201cI kind of understand why \u2014 politically, it may not be good for them,\u201d she said before his public event last week. But when Mr. Rose stood onstage minutes later to offer a fiery endorsement of the inquiry, Ms. Oliva\u2019s tufts of sprayed pink hair could be visible among the dozen or so voters who leapt to their feet to show their appreciation. For Mr. Rose, there was only one critical outburst during his impeachment announcement \u2014 from a New Jersey community organizer, who brought pamphlets from the pro-Trump LaRouche PAC \u2014 that was quickly hushed by the majority of the crowd. None of the questions selected and read aloud by the moderator addressed the impeachment inquiry, though Mr. Rose ended the event by noting that the reporters present were likely readying to ask about \u201cthe big \u2018i\u2019 word.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m glad he said it, and that we were able to hear it in person, rather than read it tomorrow in the newspaper \u2014 it\u2019s just, you feel like you\u2019re part of something,\u201d said Sharon Weerth, 70, a retired school secretary, standing outside Mr. Rose\u2019s town hall-style meeting. But most of the questions, Ms. Weerth noted, were about \u201cquality-of-life issues\" about their \"forgotten borough,\u201d stymied by tolls and a lengthy commute into the city. That was also the case for Mr. Delgado, who fielded only one impeachment question \u2014 from Mr. Plavchan \u2014 during his 70-minute town hall-style meeting in New York last week. \u201cThere are so many issues besides the Trump issue \u2014 which is certainly a major issue \u2014 but there are so many other issues that I want to get his feelings about,\u201d Roberta Brodie, who attended, said of Mr. Delgado, her congressman. \u201cI want to see Congress \u2014 the House and the Senate \u2014 do their jobs.\u201d",

      "author": "Neil Vigdor",
      "content": " Jane Fonda was arrested outside the United States Capitol on Friday as part of a climate change protest, a high-profile act of civil disobedience by the Oscar-winning actress and Vietnam War objector, who said that she planned to reprise her role every Friday for the rest of the year. Ms. Fonda, 81, was among 16 people charged with unlawfully demonstrating on the East Front of the Capitol, a misdemeanor under a Washington law prohibiting protesters from obstructing public building entrances, Capitol Police said. She had just finished speaking as part of a Fire Drill Fridays protest, the first of a weekly series of planned climate change demonstrations, when she was taken into custody at 11:50 a.m. local time. Ms. Fonda was later released on her own recognizance. With the Capitol Dome as a backdrop, Ms. Fonda said she wanted to show solidarity with young climate change strikers such as Greta Thunberg, the Swedish teenager who sailed across the Atlantic Ocean in an emissions-free yacht to draw attention to global warming. She said she had became inspired after reading the best-selling book \u201cOn Fire: The (Burning) Case for a Green New Deal\u201d by Naomi Klein about climate change over the Labor Day weekend. \u201cWe have to ensure that the climate crisis remains front and center,\u201d Ms. Fonda said. \u201cI\u2019ve been feeling that I wasn\u2019t doing enough.\u201d Ms. Fonda vowed to return to the Capitol, saying that she was moving to Washington for the next four months out of a sense of urgency and moral outrage. \u201cThe same toxic ideology that took this land from people who already lived here, that kidnapped people from Africa, turning them into slaves to work that stolen land, justified it by saying that those kidnapped and displaced people were not human beings, cut down the forests and exhausted the natural world just as it did the people \u2014 this foundational ideology is the same one that has brought us the human-driven climate change that we\u2019re facing today,\u201d she said. The arrest of Ms. Fonda, a two-time Academy Award best actress winner and fitness video siren, recalled her rebellious liberal activism during the 1960s and 1970s, for which she has received both acclaim and criticism over the decades. She had been active in the Black Panthers and started a vaudeville troupe with the fellow actor Donald Sutherland as an alternative to the U.S.O.-sponsored shows of Bob Hope for entertaining soldiers. Ms. Fonda\u2019s 1972 visit to North Vietnam, where she had urged American pilots to stop the bombings during the war, earned her the pejorative nickname \u201cHanoi Jane.\u201d Ms. Fonda, who used a microphone on Friday to address the demonstrators, said the group was trying to persuade lawmakers to support the Green New Deal, the environmental initiative proposed by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York, that calls for a net-zero carbon United States economy by 2050. The demonstrators also wanted to press Congress to put an end to fossil fuel exploration and to \u201cphase out\u201d fossil fuel infrastructure, said Ms. Fonda, who added that it was feasible to find fossil fuel industry workers comparable paying jobs in the renewable energy sector. Ms. Fonda faces a fine of up to $250 and up to 90 days in jail if convicted of unlawful demonstration. Her agent did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.",

      "author": "Catie Edmondson",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez plans on Tuesday to announce her endorsement of Marie Newman, a progressive candidate seeking to oust Representative Daniel Lipinski, a conservative-leaning Illinois Democrat, marking her first move of the 2020 campaign cycle to back a primary challenger to an incumbent. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s high-profile support amounts to a powerful seal of approval, telegraphed to her legions of ardent liberal fans, on behalf of Ms. Newman, and a reflection of the zeal of the party\u2019s progressive left to leverage its nascent power to continue targeting sitting Democrats. Ms. Newman is backed by Justice Democrats, the group that propelled Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s insurgent campaign and upset victory last year over a veteran Democratic congressman who she argued was out of step with his constituents. A businesswoman who has described herself as \u201ca real Democrat,\u201d Ms. Newman also ran in 2018 against Mr. Lipinski and lost by about 2,000 votes. \u201cMarie Newman is a textbook example of one of the ways that we could be better as a party \u2014 to come from a deep blue seat and to be championing all the issues we need to be championing,\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said in an interview. Of Mr. Lipinski, she said: \u201cThe fact that a deep blue seat is advocating for many parts of the Republican agenda is extremely problematic. We\u2019re not talking about a swing state that is being forced to take tough votes.\u201d Mr. Lipinski, 53, bills himself in his campaign ads as \u201ca workhorse, not a show horse,\u201d and the eight-term congressman, who opposes abortion rights and voted against the Affordable Care Act, has repeatedly expressed his concerns that it is \u201cdetrimental\u201d for the party to push out conservative lawmakers. He succeeded his father, William O. Lipinski, who held the seat for more than two decades before the younger Mr. Lipinski was elected in 2004. The incumbent shot back in a statement Tuesday that Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s endorsement \u201cmakes crystal clear that Ms. Newman is an extreme candidate,\u201d and added that his constituents \u201cdo not want to be represented by a fifth member of \u2018the squad,\u2019\u201d a nickname for the quartet of progressive female lawmakers in the House that includes Ms. Ocasio-Cortez. Ms. Newman, 55, a supporter of abortion rights who founded a consulting business, argues that the incumbent congressman is far more conservative than the district, a swath that includes the southwestern suburbs of Chicago. \u201cThis campaign is about putting someone in place that is in alignment directly with the district on issues like affordability for the middle class and working families, the Green New Deal,\u201d Ms. Newman said in an interview on Monday, adding that she and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez \u201cshare some very similar values.\u201d But the move also reflects a careful political calculus by Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, a Bronx Democrat. She came to Congress vowing to take down any Democrat she considered insufficiently progressive, but has, until now, refrained from taking on any of her fellow incumbents directly. In challenging Mr. Lipinski, she is targeting an incumbent Democrat, but one who has broken sharply with party orthodoxy, and has already lost the support of some of his other Democratic colleagues. The House Democrats\u2019 campaign arm in April formally broke committee business ties with political consultants and pollsters who sign on to work for primary challengers, infuriating progressive Democrats. The blacklist, Ms. Newman said, \u201cwas a very expensive issue for a while on my campaign.\u201d Progressive groups and lawmakers, however, have still flocked to support Ms. Newman. Representative Ro Khanna of California, and two Illinois lawmakers, Representative Jan Schakowsky and then-Representative Luis V. Guti\u00e9rrez, broke with party leadership in 2018 to endorse Ms. Newman, and Mr. Khanna renewed his endorsement this year. Representative Cheri Bustos of Illinois, the chairwoman of House Democrats\u2019 campaign arm, canceled a fund-raiser in support of Mr. Lipinski in May after facing a backlash from the left. Ms. Newman has also won the support of two candidates in the Democratic presidential primary, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. Ms. Warren last week announced twin endorsements of Justice Democrats candidates, backing both Ms. Newman and Jessica Cisneros, who is challenging Representative Henry Cuellar of Texas. Ms. Cisneros, who was recruited to run against Mr. Cuellar by Justice Democrats and is described by some as the next Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, has yet to win the endorsement of any sitting House Democrat. \u201cWe are so proud that Marie Newman is the first Justice Democrat of this cycle to receive an endorsement from Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,\u201d said Alexandra Rojas, the executive director of Justice Democrats. \u201cThe momentum is growing in our movement to make the Democratic Party fight for solutions as big as the problems we face and create a party that fights for its voters, not corporate donors.\u201d Until this week, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez had largely focused on helping incumbent freshmen lawmakers, like Representative Joe Neguse of Colorado, a well-liked freshman and member of Democratic leadership whom she will support at a fund-raiser in Boulder this week. In April, she rallied around some of her colleagues who flipped districts President Trump won in 2016, encouraging her Twitter followers to donate to their campaigns. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said that she would continue to assess whether she would weigh in on other primary challenges, but that she had no interest in intervening in competitive races that could tip the balance of power in the House. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to make these changes, they need to come from safe blue seats,\u201d she said.",

      "author": "Catie Edmondson",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Less than two weeks after being sworn in last year, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a young progressive star fresh off an upset of one of the top Democratic leaders in the House, put her fellow Democrats on notice that she would soon be coming for them, too. Appearing in a promotional video for Justice Democrats \u2014 the insurgent liberal group dedicated to unseating entrenched Democratic lawmakers that helped sweep her to power \u2014 Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, a Bronx firebrand, urged her supporters to recruit candidates to run against her new colleagues. She was flanked by the group\u2019s three founders, two of whom had just taken top jobs in her office. There were even whispers that she might try to oust Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, a rising star regarded by many Democrats as a future speaker. But after nearly nine months, with her eyes now wide open to the downsides of her revolutionary reputation and social media fame, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez has tempered her brash, institution-be-damned style with something different: a careful political calculus that adheres more closely to the unwritten rules of Washington she once disdained. \u201cI think I have more of a context of what it takes to do this job and survive on a day-to-day basis in a culture that is inherently hostile to people like me,\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said in an interview. Gone from her Washington office are her original chief of staff and her communications director, two Justice Democrats founders who were intent on waging their divisive brand of politics from their offices on Capitol Hill. No longer an unabashed ambassador of the combative group, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez has carefully managed her involvement with it. And she never did go after Mr. Jeffries, now the chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, the same position held last year by Representative Joseph Crowley when Ms. Ocasio-Cortez set her sights on ousting him. Instead,  she announced on Tuesday that her first endorsement of a primary challenger to an incumbent Democrat would be Marie Newman, who is making a second run at ousting Representative Daniel Lipinski of Illinois, a conservative-leaning Democrat who is regarded by many of his colleagues as something of an outlier because of his opposition to abortion rights and his vote against the Affordable Care Act. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez is not the only Democrat to break with Mr. Lipinski and support Ms. Newman, nor is she the first. Deciding on the endorsement, she said, was in part a product of having learned to balance her twin roles as a dissident and a member of Congress. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about being an activist,\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said. \u201cIt forces you to grow. So it doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t endorse activists, but it also requires an assessment for a capacity of growth and how you navigate a space like this.\u201d When she first arrived on Capitol Hill, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and her team made it clear they planned to use their perch inside Congress as a platform for their divisive, outsider brand of politics. On her first day of orientation, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez joined protesters camped outside Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s office agitating for the Green New Deal. \u201cIt could have made people mad; they could have put me on the dog walking committee,\u201d she joked later that week on a Justice Democrats conference call promoting the organization\u2019s candidate recruitment campaign. \u201cThey still might.\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez may have meant it as an offhand quip, but her comment underscored a reality on Capitol Hill that she and her team were slow to fully appreciate: the extent to which power and the ability to get things done in the House were dependent on personal relationships and respect for the hierarchy. The first-term congresswoman enjoys rich public support outside Congress, particularly on the social media platforms where progressive activism thrives. But the approach that she and her cohorts champion \u2014 pulling the institution to the left in part by threatening the careers of any Democrats who fail to embrace their ideas \u2014 quickly alienated many of her colleagues, and has made it difficult for her to get anything done. In private conversations, many of Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Democratic colleagues routinely complain that in her zeal to build her social media celebrity and political brand, she is too quick to cast aspersions on her fellow lawmakers, painting them as apologists for the status quo. \u201cIn many ways, I feel like I walk around with a scarlet letter because many members who just have any primary, whether I know about it or not, tend to project that onto me,\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said in an interview. \u201cIn many ways, I feel like I walk through that body as a symbol of someone who should not be there and a threat to the way power is organized.\u201d She said she has gone through a \u201closs of innocence and na\u00efvet\u00e9,\u201d realizing that it was impossible to separate the legislative work of serving in Congress with the politics of re-election campaigns. \u201cThey are frankly much closer in that dynamic and much closer in overlapping than a lot of people tend to realize,\u201d she said. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez has cut back on her appearances on behalf of Justice Democrats and has begun bolstering her fellow incumbent freshman lawmakers, like Representative Joe Neguse of Colorado, a member of Democratic leadership whom she is joining at a fund-raiser this week for the Boulder County Democratic Party. In April, she rallied around some of her colleagues who flipped districts President Trump won in 2016, encouraging her Twitter followers to donate to their campaigns. She diligently reached out to the so-called majority-makers on her committees \u2014 the centrist freshmen who flipped Republican-leaning seats \u2014 to win them over. Her aides, however, continued to carry the Justice Democrats\u2019 flag without restraint, tweeting out their support when the group challenged incumbents, to the dismay of Democratic aides and lawmakers. In July, Saikat Chakrabarti, then her chief of staff, ignited a firestorm by accusing centrist Democrats of enabling \u201ca racist system\u201d after they blocked an effort to defund immigration enforcement as part of an emergency border aid package. In a tweet, now deleted, he compared them to \u201cnew Southern Democrats,\u201d a reference to segregationists. It was a remarkable breach of protocol for an unelected aide. Mr. Jeffries used the House Democrats\u2019 official Twitter account to deliver a biting warning shot in a tweet, also now deleted, that singled out Mr. Chakrabarti. Two weeks later, Mr. Chakrabarti announced he would leave the office. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s new chief of staff, Ariel Eckblad, a former aide to Senator Kamala Harris of California, is well versed in the workings of Capitol Hill and is widely seen as a sober-minded replacement. Corbin Trent, who had been handling communications for both Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s campaign and her congressional office, a highly unusual arrangement, has returned to the political side. The rift was an escalation of a feud that began days earlier when Maureen Dowd, a columnist for The New York Times, asked Ms. Pelosi about the fury from Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and three other progressive freshmen over the border aid package. The speaker noted that the group had failed to persuade any other Democrats to join them in voting against the House\u2019s version of the bill. \u201cAll these people have their public whatever and their Twitter world,\u201d Ms. Pelosi said then. \u201cBut they didn\u2019t have any following. They\u2019re four people, and that\u2019s how many votes they got.\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez fired back by saying that it was she and the progressive activists who revere her, not Ms. Pelosi, who wielded the real power in the party, and later complained about  the speaker\u2019s \u201csingling out of newly elected women of color.\u201d Mr. Chakrabarti followed up with a tweet questioning the speaker\u2019s leadership. The break ultimately led to a private, one-on-one meeting last month with Ms. Pelosi in the speaker\u2019s office, where Ms. Ocasio-Cortez appeared ready to call a truce, telling reporters, \u201cI think the speaker respects the fact that we\u2019re coming together as a party and a community.\u201d \u201cVery rarely does a member enter the House and exit the House as the same person,\u201d said former Representative Steve Israel, Democrat of New York. In freshman orientation, Mr. Israel said, representatives are asked what kind of member they want to be: an activist, a policy wonk, a political leader. \u201cYou have to grapple with choosing a lane,\u201d he said, \u201cand very often, you end up shifting lanes.\u201d But Waleed Shahid, a spokesman for Justice Democrats, said Ms. Ocasio-Cortez has never been interested in staying in just one lane. \u201cNavigating her role as a legislator and a movement builder is basically what her career is about,\u201d Mr. Shahid said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to have that theory of change with one foot in D.C. and one foot in the movement. It\u2019s really hard to do that.\u201d For Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, the process continues to be bumpy. Even with Ms. Eckblad at the helm, her office still operates in some ways more like an upstart campaign on a shoestring budget than like a congressional office. A replacement for Mr. Trent has yet to be hired, and another aide who routinely irritates rank-and-file aides and lawmakers with combative comments \u2014 like when he claimed his fellow congressional aides were elitist \u201ccareerists\u201d \u2014 is still in place. And while it is not clear how many more Justice Democrats Ms. Ocasio-Cortez will endorse, she said she was still \u201cvery wedded\u201d to the insurgent theory of change that propelled her to Congress. \u201cChange by nature takes friction,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a question of how we move through it.\u201d",

      "author": "Jennifer Medina",
      "content": " The advertisement began with a photo of Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez bursting into flames, followed by a black-and-white image of skulls lined up on the ground. The provocative advertisement, which warned about socialism by invoking the murderous Khmer Rouge movement in Cambodia, was paid for by a Republican political action committee and aired during the Democratic primary debate on Thursday night. The televised commercial came weeks after the shooting in El Paso, where a white nationalist killed 22 people in the deadliest massacre targeting Latinos in modern American history. Since El Paso, many Latinos have said they fear for their safety, worried about future attacks by white supremacists. The group that paid for the ad, New Faces GOP, states on its website that its mission is to \u201chelp elevate the next generation of Republicans\u201d and recruit more diverse candidates. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, a New York lawmaker who is one of about 40 Latinos in Congress, has previously spoken about receiving death threats and was one of four first-term congresswoman President Trump told to \u201cgo back where you came from.\u201d Shortly after the advertisement aired, she called it \u201ca love letter to the G.O.P.\u2019s white supremacist case.\u201d By Friday morning, many critics on Twitter were calling for a boycott of ABC. Some defended the network by noting that the ad ran only on certain stations, including those owned by Sinclair Broadcast Group, which owns 193 local affiliates across the country. National groups also criticized ABC for running the advertisement, saying it promoted violence and calling it \u201ccompletely irresponsible.\u201d A spokeswoman for ABC declined to comment on Friday. On the debate stage, the Democratic candidates discussed the shooting in somber and urgent terms. Many of the candidates praised Beto O\u2019Rourke, an El Paso native, for his aggressive response to the attack. During the debate, his campaign unveiled a new website labeling Mr. Trump a white supremacist. The advertisement features Elizabeth Heng, a Republican from California\u2019s Central Valley who lost her 2018 challenge to Jim Costa, a Democrat, by 15 percentage points. \u201cThis is the face of socialism,\u201d Ms. Heng says, as a picture of Ms. Ocasio-Cortez burns. \u201cDoes Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez know the horror of socialism?\u201d Ms. Heng adds as a photo of skulls in a Khmer Rouge death camp is displayed. \u201cMy father was minutes from death in Cambodia before a forced marriage saved his life,\u201d Ms. Heng says. \u201cThat\u2019s socialism: Forced obedience. Starvation.\u201d \u201cMine is a face of freedom \u2014 my skin is not white; I\u2019m not outrageous, racist, nor socialist,\u201d she adds. \u201cI\u2019m a Republican.\u201d Republicans have made a significant effort to recruit young candidates of color in recent years, and have stepped up such attempts in California since their 2018 losses. During the midterm elections, Republicans targeted some Democrats with ties to the Middle East by portraying them as terrorist sympathizers. Ms. Heng appeared to take full credit for the advertisement Thursday night. \u201cAre you really calling me a racist,\u201d she wrote on Twitter. \u201cI\u2019m calling all Democrats out for supporting an evil ideology.\u201d",

      "author": "Sydney Ember",
      "content": " Senator Bernie Sanders wanted a show of force to convince voters he was back from his heart attack, and he produced one on Saturday: At his first rally since the episode just two and a half weeks ago, he reveled in one of the most coveted endorsements in the Democratic Party, from Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. Drawing loud cheers from a large, enthusiastic and diverse crowd that had packed into a park in Queens next to a public housing complex, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez offered resounding words of support, for both Mr. Sanders and his influence in shaping the Democratic primary. \u201cNo one wanted to question the system, and in 2016, he fundamentally changed politics in America,\u201d she said, minutes before Mr. Sanders joined her on the stage. \u201cWe right now have one of the best Democratic presidential primary fields in a generation and much of that is thanks to the work that Bernie Sanders has done in his entire life.\u201d Mr. Sanders declared himself \u201cso delighted\u201d that Ms. Ocasio-Cortez had thrown her support behind his campaign, hailing her as \u201can inspiration to millions of young people not just here in New York but across this country who now understand the importance of political participation and standing up for justice.\u201d Mr. Sanders said the crowd exceeded the 20,000 people the campaign had secured a permit for. Campaign officials, keen to affirm Mr. Sanders\u2019s resilience and mindful of the big crowd Senator Elizabeth Warren attracted to her rally last month in Washington Square Park, said more than 25,000 people turned out. During his remarks, Mr. Sanders also briefly and somewhat indirectly, addressed his health. \u201cI am happy to report to you that I am more than ready, more ready than ever, to carry on with you the epic struggle that we face today,\u201d he said. \u201cI am more than ready to assume the office of president of the United States.\u201d \u201cTo put it bluntly,\u201d he added, \u201cI am back.\u201d It was a theme that dominated the afternoon, as progressive activists and leaders paraded onto the stage to extend their own words of encouragement. There was his wife, Jane Sanders, who declared him \u201chealthy\u201d and \u201cmore than ready to continue his lifelong struggle to fight for the working people of America.\u201d There was Michael Moore, the filmmaker, who said he was \u201cglad\u201d Mr. Sanders was 78. \u201cWe will benefit from his wisdom.\u201d And there was Tiffany Cab\u00e1n, who nearly won the Queens district attorney race earlier this year; Carmen Yulin Cruz, the mayor of San Juan, and Nina Turner, a vocal supporter at his rallies on the campaign trail. Beyond serving as a show of strength, their presence aligned with a more unifying, inclusive message his campaign is aggressively trying to project. At the end of his address, he urged audience members to look around and find someone they didn\u2019t know. Then he asked a series of questions designed to promote a sense of unity. \u201cAre you willing to fight for that person who you don\u2019t even know as much as you\u2019re willing to fight for yourself?\u201d he asked. \u201cAre you willing to fight for young people drowning in student debt even if you are not? Are you willing to fight to ensure that every American has health care as a human right even if you have good health care? Are you willing to fight for frightened immigrant neighbors even if you are native born?\u201d Last week, the Sanders campaign announced that Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, who along with Ms. Ocasio-Cortez is one of the most prominent left-wing women in Congress, had also endorsed him. The pair of endorsements jolted the primary race, signaling that Mr. Sanders was still a formidable contender just as it had increasingly seemed like a contest between Ms. Warren and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. They also shifted the conversation away from his health issues and his age, infusing his campaign with a renewed sense of vitality. \u201cThere\u2019s been some degree of criticism over all \u2014 Bernie Sanders can\u2019t win because his movement is tapped out,\u201d Faiz Shakir, Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign manager, said. \u201cThis discounted that.\u201d But if the endorsements were an obvious indication that Mr. Sanders was not ready to surrender the party\u2019s left flank to Ms. Warren, it is not clear how much they will ultimately change the race \u2014 in part because there are signs that voters are not taking their cues from endorsements. Ms. Warren, for instance, has attracted huge crowds, posted some of the biggest fund-raising numbers, and surged to the top of national and early-state polls despite lacking endorsements from a single governor, big-city mayor or senator outside her home state. At the same time, Senator Kamala Harris of California is struggling to gain momentum even though she has the backing of politicians across the country, including her state\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom. Mr. Sanders\u2019s endorsements could inject fresh energy into a campaign that in some respects needed it badly. Consistently trailing Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren in recent polls and struggling to expand his base, he spent the last two weeks facing a barrage of questions about his health. His campaign made a show of financial strength this month when it reported it had collected $25.3 million between July and September \u2014 the most of any candidate in that period \u2014 but the announcement was quickly eclipsed by the news of his heart attack. Mr. Sanders\u2019s aides are also confident that the women will motivate young people, a group that was critical to his success in 2016 and that his allies know he must win over again, both in term of perception and for actual votes. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone would question or doubt that they, more than a lot of people, have the ability to inspire young people,\u201d Mr. Shakir said, referring to Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and Ms. Omar. \u201cThat in itself is going to be tremendous.\u201d The endorsements underscore how Mr. Sanders is striving to portray himself as the candidate furthest to the left. In recent months, as support for Ms. Warren has swelled, Mr. Sanders has unveiled policy proposals that have gone beyond hers \u2014 including plans to completely eliminate student debt and medical debt, and to impose a wealth tax that would apply to more households and is steeper for rich people than the one Ms. Warren has proposed. Several Democratic officials and strategists said the endorsements of Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and Ms. Omar \u2014 and possibly Representative Rashida Tlaib of Michigan \u2014 could stoke enthusiasm among the far left and perhaps prompt some of Ms. Warren\u2019s supporters to take a second look at Mr. Sanders. But some said the endorsements might not do much to grow his existing coalition, pointing out that the two women carry a similar anti-establishment, populist message that already appeals to Mr. Sanders\u2019s voter base. Some suggested the endorsements could even help Ms. Warren by making her appear more moderate and pragmatic in comparison with Mr. Sanders. Though Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and Ms. Omar have a big following nationally, and have become preferred targets of President Trump\u2019s, their support may not help woo voters, particularly in critical early states. Jess Morales Rocketto, a Democratic strategist who worked on Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign, said that the endorsements could give Mr. Sanders a fund-raising bump and more news media attention. But she was skeptical that the new support would sway undecided voters. \u201cI don\u2019t know that a congresswoman from New York, one from Minnesota, one from Michigan are super influential to voters in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina,\u201d she said. Mr. Sanders\u2019s allies said the visual imagery alone \u2014 an older man standing with younger women of color \u2014 could be enough of a benefit, especially as he continues to fight the perception that his voter base is skewed white and male. Cori Bush, who was endorsed by Ms. Ocasio-Cortez in her unsuccessful bid for Congress last year in St. Louis, said the endorsements from the two women \u201cknocks away that whole Bernie Bro idea.\u201d She also said their support \u201cwipes away the idea that maybe he\u2019s not the progressive champion anymore.\u201d Last month, the Working Families Party, an influential liberal group that backed Mr. Sanders in 2016, endorsed Ms. Warren. The announcement infuriated his supporters. But it also sent a message: It was time for progressives to pick a side and start organizing. Maurice Mitchell, the Working Families Party\u2019s national director, dismissed the notion that the dueling endorsements would splinter the left. \u201cWe\u2019ve said from the beginning that progressives need to get involved, and that\u2019s exactly what they did,\u201d he said, referring to Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and Ms. Omar. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing for our movement that folks choose one of these candidates.\u201d Mr. Mitchell said his group \u2014 which endorsed Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s opponent, then-Representative Joseph Crowley, in the 2018 primary \u2014 planned to marshal its network of volunteers across the country to work with voters to nominate Ms. Warren. What is less obvious is the role Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and Ms. Omar will play for the Sanders campaign. Waleed Shahid, the communications director for the progressive group Justice Democrats, which helped propel Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s congressional campaign, said the two women could mobilize their own networks of volunteers and donors. He pointed to Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s influence this year in the Democratic primary for district attorney in Queens, where her support for Ms. Cab\u00e1n helped to nearly lift her to victory. And because the two congresswomen represent the activist base of the party, he said, they could galvanize progressive activists around the country. But perhaps above all, the endorsements will help dispel questions about Mr. Sanders\u2019s viability post-heart attack, he said. Already, there are some indications the strategy could be working. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it makes him seem less old,\u201d Rashaun Durden, 29, said on Saturday as he waited for Mr. Sanders\u2019s rally to begin. \u201cBut I think it shows that the young generation still wants to support him regardless of his age.\u201d ",

      "author": "Lola Fadulu",
      "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 For a House freshman and political neophyte, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York has proved to be remarkably adept at shaping the debate on her Democratic Party\u2019s left flank, boosting the visibility of single-payer health care through her support of \u201cMedicare for all\u201d and elevating climate change with her Green New Deal. On Wednesday, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez hopes to do for the nation\u2019s poor what she has done with health care and climate politics with the unveiling of an ambitious anti-poverty package that, among other things, would cap annual rent increases, ensure full access to social welfare programs for people with convictions and undocumented immigrants, pressure federal contractors to offer better wages and benefits, and update official poverty measurements by taking into account geographic cost-of-living variations and access to health insurance, child care, and \u201cnew necessities\u201d such as internet access. \u201cI think this really starts to approach, head on, economic injustice in America,\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said in an interview. \u201cWe are at our richest point that we\u2019ve ever been, but we\u2019ve also been our most unequal.\u201d She added, \u201cit\u2019s something that we have to talk about.\u201d Since defeating Representative Joe Crowley, a senior member of the Democratic leadership, during the 2018 primaries, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, 29, has used her social-media following \u2014 4 million followers on Instagram and more than 5 million on Twitter \u2014 and strong ties to the party\u2019s progressive wing to shift the party leftward. Her Green New Deal would move the nation\u2019s energy economy rapidly away from fossil fuels, with vague promises of guaranteed job security. Medicare for all would replace all private insurance with one government-run health care system like Britain\u2019s or Canada\u2019s. Such ideas would have once been dismissed as fringe initiatives on the far left, but many members of Congress and Democratic presidential candidates have rushed to embrace them, seeking the approval of Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and her supporters. \u201cShe\u2019s a lightning rod,\u201d said Dianne Enriquez, a director at the Center for Popular Democracy, a liberal advocacy group. \u201cI think the boldness, the ability to be innovative, the willingness to go out on a limb for what she believes is right is really what makes her an ideal champion for a lot of the issues that have gone largely ignored at the federal level.\u201d Establishment Democrats have worried that Ms. Ocasio-Cortez have moved the conversation too far to the left too fast, becoming the policy face of the party and jeopardizing the political futures of more moderate members elected last year in Republican-leaning districts. But in recent weeks, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez has pushed out her chief of staff, who had picked fights with moderate Democrats, and moved her combative communications director to her campaign. Unlike the Green New Deal, which is a gauzy congressional resolution, her anti-poverty initiative, \u201cA Just Society,\u201d is six fully formed bills, written in legislative language \u2014 another sign of serious legislative intent. She had good reason to make overtures to fellow House Democrats, who had grown weary of her staff\u2019s antagonism. Matt Bennett, the executive vice president of Third Way, a centrist Democratic organization, said Ms. Ocasio-Cortez is \u201cvastly more influential\u201d than most freshman House members. But, he added: \u201cLegislating is an inherently group activity. The question is, if she wants to move this legislation, or any that she\u2019s sponsoring, can she attract co-sponsors and votes? We\u2019ll see if she has the ability to do that as well.\u201d As the Green New Deal looked to Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s signature initiative, \u201cA Just Society\u201d echoes Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s Great Society. \u201cWith the Green New Deal, we weren\u2019t just talking about climate change; we\u2019re talking about the systems that got us to climate change,\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said. \u201cWe\u2019re addressing root causes.\u201d \u201cAnd similarly,\u201d she added, \u201cwith our Just Society package, we\u2019re not simply addressing poverty or wages. We\u2019re addressing some of the basic structural reasons that are resulting in those outcomes.\u201d Nearly 40 million people in the United States live in poverty. Even middle-class workers face a shortage of affordable housing and stagnant wages. The problems are worse for both people of color, including immigrants, and people who were formerly incarcerated. The Trump administration\u2019s response has been to tighten access to some federally funded low-income programs. The bills in Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s package seek to change the federal response. She conceded that because Democrats do not control the Senate or the White House, her intention is to lay \u201cdown a vision for when we take back both of those bodies.\u201d The Recognizing Real Poverty Act requires the secretary of health and human services, in collaboration with the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, to work with the National Academy of Sciences to change the poverty line, adjusting for family size and geographic differences in the cost of goods and services. The poverty threshold would be raised to account for health insurance costs, work expenses, child care, and consideration of new necessities such as internet access. Poverty has been \u201ca taboo word in our politics for so long,\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said. Even if they are officially above the poverty line, there are \u201cpeople who are living a quality of life on par\u201d with the impoverished, she added, \u201cbut you wouldn\u2019t see that based on our numbers because we choose not to measure it.\u201d Ms. Enriquez said housing has not been a central topic of the Democratic presidential debates, even though several contenders have released full-fledged affordable housing plans. She said she hopes that Ms. Ocasio-Cortez can help elevate the issue with one of the bills in her package, the Place to Prosper Act, which would provide tenant protections and regulate corporate landlords. That bill would cap rent increases at 3 percent a year and restrict the reasons that landlords could evict tenants. For instance, a tenant could only be evicted if they have not paid rent for two or more consecutive months, have wrecked a property, or if the landlord needs a unit to house an immediate relative. The bill would prohibit discrimination because of the source of a tenant\u2019s income and would provide funding for tenant legal representatives. The act would also mandate that landlords keep rental units in good repair. It would allocate $10 billion for fiscal years 2020 through 2029 for removing toxins. Housing in America \u201cis a crisis,\u201d she said, \u201cand it\u2019s not one that we are discussing enough at the level that we need to be discussing it.\u201d Two other bills, The Embrace Act and The Mercy in Re-Entry Act, would outlaw the denial of any federal benefit because of immigration status or a past criminal conviction. The Uplift Our Workers Act would create a \u201cworker-friendliness score\u201d for federal contractors which would consider, for example, whether the contractor offers paid overtime for those who work more than 40 hours per week, or provides predictable scheduling, paid sick leave and paid parental and family leave. None of this will be enacted in the foreseeable future. \u201cNo one questions her ability to raise awareness around an issue,\u201d Mr. Bennett said, \u201cjust because she wields her social media and mainstream media platforms very effectively. But that\u2019s not the same as getting votes on a bill.\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez acknowledged the package\u2019s ambitions. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any shortage of obstacles that we have ahead of us, but I don\u2019t think that we not do things just because they\u2019re hard,\u201d she said. \u201cIn fact, sometimes the hard things to do are the most worthwhile.\u201d",

      "content": " CORALVILLE, Iowa \u2014 Bernie Sanders on Saturday unleashed his most forceful rebuke yet of Michael R. Bloomberg\u2019s potential presidential bid, warning the former mayor of New York that he would not be able to \u201cbuy this election\u201d and chastising his plan to skip campaigning in the early states. Speaking at a rally in Coralville, near the liberal home of the University of Iowa, Mr. Sanders, the senator from Vermont, repeatedly addressed Mr. Bloomberg by name, almost daring him to enter a Democratic primary race that has already been in progress for months. \u201cOur campaign is going to end the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality which exists in America today,\u201d said Mr. Sanders, who was joined by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a standard-bearer of the progressive left. \u201cSo tonight we say to Michael Bloomberg and other billionaires: Sorry, you ain\u2019t going to buy this election.\u201d He also derided Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s intended strategy of bypassing the key early voting states where so many of the current candidates are devoting time, money and resources. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to get elected president by avoiding Iowa, by avoiding New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to buy this election by spending hundreds of millions of dollars on media in California. Those days are gone.\u201d Mr. Bloomberg on Friday took the first step toward a candidacy, filing paperwork to qualify for the ballot in Alabama. His looming entry into the race has underscored its fluidity while presenting the threat of a centrist competitor to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. As a leading progressive, Mr. Sanders could potentially benefit from a Bloomberg candidacy that siphoned voters from Mr. Biden. But Mr. Sanders displayed no eagerness to see Mr. Bloomberg in the race, and was quick to draw a direct contrast between their efforts, saying his campaign had the grass-roots support to win rather than billions of dollars in the bank. \u201cBloomberg can have his billions,\u201d he said, \u201cbut that is why we are going to win this election.\u201d The rally was Mr. Sanders\u2019s second public event of the day with Ms. Ocasio-Cortez of New York, who joined him on Friday for a two-day swing through the first-in-the-nation caucus state. During a rally in Council Bluffs on Friday, both progressive politicians largely avoided making any references to Mr. Bloomberg. Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s early moves, and his suggestion that he would follow the unconventional campaign strategy of skipping all four traditional early-state contests and instead stake his candidacy on delegate-rich primary states like California and Texas, has supplied fresh fodder for candidates like Mr. Sanders and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who are both campaigning on anti-elitist, progressive messages. Earlier in the day on Saturday, at a climate change forum in Des Moines, Mr. Sanders directed a more glancing blow at Mr. Bloomberg, saying the country needed \u201ca dynamic democracy \u2014 a democracy where all of us play a role in shaping public policy, not some billionaire who decides that he wants to run for president of the United States because he\u2019s a billionaire.\u201d Mr. Sanders also took a shot at Mr. Biden, who recently said he would be willing to accept support from a super PAC; his campaign, Mr. Sanders said, had no such financial vehicle.",

      "content": " CORALVILLE, Iowa \u2014 It was her first visit to Iowa, but Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez bounded onstage like she was speaking to a hometown crowd in Queens. \u201cAre you all ready for a revolution?\u201d she said, as rap lyrics in Spanish rang through the crowd. \u201cI sure am.\u201d Her question was a fitting prelude for the man Ms. Ocasio-Cortez was there to introduce: Bernie Sanders, who has been pushing a similarly insurgent message for decades. Like Mr. Sanders, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, the congresswoman from New York, spoke of solidarity. Like him, she name-dropped Franklin D. Roosevelt. \u201cWhen people try to accuse us of going too far left \u2014 we\u2019re not pushing the party left,\u201d she said, to raucous applause, \u201cWe are bringing the party home.\u201d On a two-day swing through Iowa this weekend Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and Mr. Sanders, the senator from Vermont, traversed the state in tandem, an unlikely duo separated in age by nearly half a century, spreading their ideology in an unlikely place. They held rallies in Council Bluffs on the state\u2019s conservative western edge and in Coralville, near the liberal home of the University of Iowa. They hosted a climate change forum in Des Moines. The trip was their first together since Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, 30, endorsed Mr. Sanders, 78, last month, a decision that immediately jolted the Democratic primary and injected fresh energy into his campaign. Less than three weeks after he suffered his heart attack, they held an enormous rally in New York City that both demonstrated his political strength and deflected attention away from his health and age. Now, as Mr. Sanders reboots his campaign and prepares for an all-out push in Iowa, he is on a quest to lure the progressive left to him and away from Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and to convince the country that they need a wholesale revolution rather than \u201cbig, structural change.\u201d In Iowa, having Ms. Ocasio-Cortez by his side could prove a powerful weapon, as he and Ms. Warren remain locked in an intense battle to win over progressive caucusgoers with political appeals and policy plans. Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign is confident that Ms. Ocasio-Cortez will help motivate young people, a group that was critical to his success in 2016 but is now also excited by Ms. Warren, as well as the entrepreneur Andrew Yang. His advisers are also betting that her support, and the endorsements of Representatives Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, will help counter the criticism that he is running a campaign that appeals only to white, young men. Indeed, Mr. Sanders and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez cut a striking image: An older Jewish man from Brooklyn alongside a young woman of color from the Bronx \u2014 the standard-bearer of the American left and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 \u2014 together in the Midwest to share their message of democratic socialism. Even Mr. Sanders, who takes politics more seriously than most, couldn\u2019t resist cracking a joke about their partnership. \u201cPeople sometimes say that Alexandria and I are an odd couple, that she is so old and I am so young,\u201d he said in Council Bluffs on Friday night. \u201cBut that\u2019s okay. I\u2019m not an ageist.\u201d At all of three of their public events in Iowa, the atmosphere was festive, with little of the paternal scolding that can sometimes characterize Mr. Sanders\u2019s speeches. There were no homemade signs \u2014 the campaign does not allow them, fearing they could block the view for TV cameras \u2014 but there was a silhouette of Mr. Sanders\u2019s head projected onto a wall in Coralville. Onstage, Mr. Sanders and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez clasped hands, raising them together \u2014 him beaming like a proud professor, albeit one who seemed to understand he might soon be eclipsed by his student; her commanding an audience that was at once rapt and ebullient. \u201cI cannot think of any member of Congress who has done more within one year to fundamentally transform American politics,\u201d Mr. Sanders said in Council Bluffs. Yet what remains unclear, even after her positive reception this weekend, is whether Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and the political ideology that she and Mr. Sanders embrace resonates beyond Iowa\u2019s more liberal pockets. Mr. Sanders is still running third in most polls, faces formidable competition from Ms. Warren for progressive voters and is likely to endure nagging doubts about his fitness right up until the first Iowans caucus on Feb. 3. \u201cIt plays moderately well in blue areas, but far less well in areas that voted Republican in 2016,\u201d said Steven Drahozal, the Democratic chair in Dubuque County, Iowa, which narrowly voted for Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton. \u201cThey have been painted as socialists, and that turns off many moderate and Republican voters.\u201d But if Iowans are used to seeing Mr. Sanders, they are less used to seeing Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, and several attendees expressed particular enthusiasm for catching their first in-person glimpse of her. \u201cEveryone loves Bernie and especially A.O.C.,\u201d said George Holtz, 18, as he waited for the rally in Coralville to begin. \u201cI\u2019m excited to see him but I\u2019m really mostly here for her.\u201d A student at the University of Iowa, Mr. Holtz said he was still trying to decide whether to caucus for Mr. Sanders or Ms. Warren. But he said that Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s support for Mr. Sanders was swaying him, particularly because of what it signaled about her appreciation for his policies to combat climate change. \u201cIf Alexandria is supporting him, then I feel like I should too,\u201d he said. His friend, Isabella O\u2019Connor, 19, was equally enthused about Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, even though she was an intern on Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign. \u201cI loooove A.O.C.,\u201d she said. \u201cA.O.C. is my role model. She inspires me in a way that I haven\u2019t seen. And that\u2019s because she is young and she is unapologetic and she is unafraid. I respect her so much.\u201d Before the climate change forum in Des Moines, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez canvassed for Mr. Sanders, going door-to-door to speak directly with caucusgoers. During her public appearances with him, she at times seemed to dazzle the audience with her stage presence and her elegant political phrasing. \u201cThis is not about something that we allow to happen to us,\u201d she said at the rally in Council Bluffs, which drew a significant number of people from more liberal Omaha. \u201cWe don\u2019t let this race happen to us. We don\u2019t watch the presidential race. This is not a movie. This is a movement.\u201d She also subtly hinted at her own political ambitions. \u201cI\u2019m here today in Iowa because I want to grow, because I want to learn,\u201d she said at one point. \u201cBecause I want to learn about your fight so that I can take that and stitch it together with the Bronx and stitch it together with Baltimore and stitch it together with rural upstate New York and stitch it together with our black brothers and sisters in the South.\u201d It was a message that left an impression with audience members like Vivian Banderas, a 27-year-old from Omaha, who said after the rally that she had \u201cstarted crying when Alexandria was talking about her story and her struggle.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s just amazing to see someone with that background up onstage,\u201d she said, calling the partnership between Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and Mr. Sanders a \u201cdream team.\u201d Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign boasted repeatedly about their crowds this weekend, saying he and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez spoke to thousands of people in their two days in Iowa. But nowhere was it more apparent than in Coralville on Saturday night which of the speakers many of them had come to see: As soon as Ms. Ocasio-Cortez finished speaking, people began to head out the door.",

      "content": " WESTERVILLE, Ohio \u2014 Representative Ilhan Omar endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont for the Democratic presidential nomination on Tuesday, and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez will endorse Mr. Sanders at a rally this weekend, according to his campaign. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York and a star of the progressive left, will join Mr. Sanders at his \u201cBernie\u2019s Back\u201d rally in Queens on Saturday. Earlier Tuesday, his campaign had teased that Mr. Sanders would have a \u201cspecial guest\u201d at the event. News of the endorsements came as the Democratic presidential candidates were wrapping up their appearances in the fourth debate of the primary season. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s planned endorsement was first reported by The Washington Post. The endorsements, which come just two weeks after Mr. Sanders suffered a heart attack in Las Vegas, are likely to provide a much-needed boost to Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign. They could also serve to quell some concerns about his health and his age. \u201cBernie is leading a working-class movement to defeat Donald Trump that transcends generation, ethnicity and geography,\u201d Ms. Omar, Democrat of Minnesota, said in a statement. She cited the bill she and Mr. Sanders introduced in June to cancel all of the country\u2019s student debt, worth about $1.6 trillion, and praised him for working to end foreign wars. \u201cI believe Bernie Sanders is the best candidate to take on Donald Trump in 2020,\u201d she said. In his own statement, Mr. Sanders called Ms. Omar \u201ca leader of strength and courage.\u201d Mr. Sanders, 78, has been recovering since his heart attack, first at a hospital and then at his home in Burlington, Vt. The debate on Tuesday night in Westerville, Ohio, just outside of Columbus, was his first appearance before a national audience since the episode. Mr. Sanders\u2019s health issues have cast a degree of uncertainty over his campaign and left his aides rushing to reassure voters about his age and health, just as he was trying to improve his standing in a race that in recent weeks has become more of a two-person contest between Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. Asked about his health directly at the debate on Tuesday night, Mr. Sanders nodded to the rally and to the \u201cspecial guest.\u201d \u201cLet me invite you all to a major rally we\u2019re having in Queens,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a special guest at that event, and we are going to be mounting a vigorous campaign all over this country.\u201d He also said, \u201cI\u2019m feeling great.\u201d Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign is billing the New York rally as his official return to the campaign trail. It had toyed with holding the rally in Prospect Park in Brooklyn, according to an aide, but settled on a park in Queens, with a backdrop of the Manhattan skyline. Presidential endorsements from the congresswomen, both members of the group of first-term Democratic women of color known as \u201cthe squad,\u201d were highly coveted. In addition to being among the country\u2019s most prominent progressives, the members of the group \u2014 Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, Ms. Omar, Representative Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Representative Ayanna S. Pressley of Massachusetts \u2014  have also become some of President Trump\u2019s favorite foils. Assorted news reports said that Ms. Tlaib planned to endorse Mr. Sanders as well, and early Wednesday Ms. Omar tweeted that Ms. Tlaib was backing him. Ms. Tlaib\u2019s team did not respond to requests for comment, and Mr. Sanders\u2019s aides did not confirm that Ms. Tlaib had endorsed him. In a statement, an aide to Ms. Pressley said: \u201cAyanna has tremendous respect for her sisters-in-service. Ultimately, these political decisions are made as individuals. Ayanna knows that taking back the White House in 2020 is a top priority, and she is working everyday to hold this Administration accountable.\u201d Last month, Ms. Warren won the endorsement of the Working Families Party, a progressive group that endorsed Mr. Sanders during the last presidential cycle. The endorsement was a boon to Ms. Warren\u2019s candidacy as she aimed to position herself as Mr. Biden\u2019s main rival and the standard-bearer for the progressive left. But it also unnerved supporters of Mr. Sanders, who criticized the endorsement process.",
