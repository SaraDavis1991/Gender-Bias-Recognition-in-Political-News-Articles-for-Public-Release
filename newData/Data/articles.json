            "content": " The Justice Democrats helped Ocasio-Cortez oust veteran Rep. Joe Crowley (D-NY) in a primary in New York\u2019s 14th congressional district earlier this year. In a tweet, she supported the Justice Democrats\u2019 new \u201c#OurTime\u201d campaign:  Since winning her election Nov. 6, Ocasio-Cortez has continued to challenge the Democratic Party leadership, joining a sit-in protest in the office of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) over climate change policy. Though she has not yet taken office, Ocasio-Cortez is already committing to replacing many of her colleagues \u2014 apparently on the basis of race and ideology. A press release from the Justice Democrats declared (original emphasis): After participating in sit-ins at Nancy Pelosi\u2019s office on Tuesday, Justice Democrats\u00a0officially launched the #OurTime project to repeat the organization\u2019s success in recruiting and electing Congresswoman-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The progressive grassroots organization will recruit the next generation of primary challengers to Democratic incumbents who are demographically and ideologically out-of-touch with their districts. The online conference call where the project was announced was\u00a0joined by Ocasio-Cortez, who voiced her support for the project. \u201cWe recruited and supported Ocasio-Cortez all the way to a historic victory and now we\u2019re going to repeat the playbook,\u201d said Justice Democrats Executive Director Alexandra Rojas. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of blue districts in this country where communities want to support a new generation of diverse working-class leaders who fight tirelessly for their voters and build a movement around big solutions to our country\u2019s biggest problems. We\u2019re creating an alternative pathway to Congress for grassroots candidates to become leaders in the Democratic Party.\u201d The #OurTime project is a grassroots candidate recruitment effort asking Democrats and progressives around the country to submit nominees for both potential candidates and districts where an Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez-style campaign might succeed. The organization will prioritize candidates who are women, represent the diversity of communities in their district, and support the major tenets of Justice Democrats platform: rejecting corporate PAC donations, Medicare For All, free college, dismantling mass incarceration and deportations, and a Green New Deal. Others backing the campaign include Palestinian American Representative-elect Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), whose views are so hostile to Israel that even the left-wing J Street organization withdrew its support for her campaign.

(Zimbabwe\u2019s ruling party and its recently-ousted dictator, Robert Mugabe, defined themselves as socialist.) Socialist @AOC discusses Venezuela.

Used by scholars,\u00a0activists and an increasing number of journalists, Latinx is quickly gaining popularity among the general public. It\u2019s part of a \u201clinguistic revolution\u201d\u00a0that aims to move beyond gender binaries and is inclusive of the intersecting identities of\u00a0Latin American descendants. In addition to men and women from all racial backgrounds, Latinx also makes room for people who are trans, queer, agender, non-binary, gender non-conforming or gender fluid. According to Google Trends data cited by HuffPost, the term was virtually unknown in Internet searches before 2016. Ocasio-Cortez is a big fan of the term, judging from her Twitter feed:       It is not clear whether Ocasio-Cortez herself identifies as gender-neutral. If so, she could become the first gender-neutral member of Congress, should she win the general election in November.",

With Kavanaugh sworn\u00a0into the Supreme Court as of Saturday evening, he is the fourth justice to be nominated by a president who did not win the popular vote. President Donald Trump, who beat his Democrat rival Hillary Clinton\u00a0by 77 electoral\u00a0votes (304-227) in the 2016 presidential election, has placed Neil\u00a0Gorsuch\u00a0and\u00a0now\u00a0Kavanaugh\u00a0on the\u00a0court.

Ocasio-Cortez claimed, without evidence, that \u201cRepublicans\u201d and \u201cconservative outlets\u201d had circulated the image. The relevant section of the interview is as follows: The Post: How did you feel when that hit yesterday? Ocasio-Cortez: I was surprised and I was annoyed because it was a new tack. They\u2019ve been for a very long time focusing on taking quotes out of context or manipulating them or making it seem as though I said things that I didn\u2019t say. This was different in that it was an outright fraudulent thing. You can tell that they\u2019re getting into hysterics because now you\u2019re getting into my actual body, which is definitely crossing a level, definitely crossing a line. I also think it\u2019s encouraging because this is my sixth day in Congress and they\u2019re out of all their artillery. The nude is supposed to be like the bazooka. You know, like, \u201cWe\u2019re going to take her down.\u201d Dude, you\u2019re all out of bullets, you\u2019re all out of bombs, you\u2019re all out of all this stuff. What have you got left?

The freshman Democratic lawmaker from New York refused to back down from that comparison, and in her conversation with Yahoo News, Ocasio-Cortez argued that many things about President Trump echo that dark period in history. Read the full Yahoo! News article here. Also on Monday evening, National Border Patrol Council president Brandon Judd told\u00a0Breitbart News Tonight that Ocasio-Cortez had lied about conditions at facilities where illegal aliens are being held near the border, as well as about the behavior of officers at the facilities. \u201cHow can you have the moral high ground if you are going to throw facts out the window and spew falsehoods?\u201d he commented. Ocasio-Cortez was elected in November as part of a Democratic Party victory in the U.S. House of Representatives, matching a pattern throughout recent U.S. history in which the opposition fares well in the midterm elections. Since taking office, Ocasio-Cortez has proposed ambitious new policies that grant sweeping powers to the government over the U.S. economy, envisioning a highly controlled system in which the state controls private industry and steers it toward overarching utopian goals, such as a shift to 100% renewable energy and the elimination of fossil fuels.

On Monday, Ocasio-Crazy, probably from that luxury apartment of hers, filmed a video that compared American migrant camps to \u201cconcentration camps.\u201d Nevermind that our migrant camps have been in use long before President Trump took office. Nevermind that these illegal migrants enjoy free food, healthcare, and sanitary conditions. Nevermind that if these illegal migrants simply agreed to return home where they belong, we would provide free transportation (translation: they are NOT prisoners). Nevermind that what was perfectly okay under Obama is a concentration camp because Orange Man Bad. Ocasio-Crazy\u2019s comparison is, of course, not only outrageous, it is yet another way to deliberately smear Trump as a Nazi, which is a sure way to embolden violence or an assassination attempt against him. The good news is that Ocasio-Crazy got some well-deserved blowback. Because on top of her mindless stupidity and dangerous rhetoric, there is the not-unimportant matter of her trivializing the Holocaust. Naturally, though, as soon as the backlash began, Ocasio-Crazy did what she usually does in these matters\u2026 She played dumb and lied. \u201cAnd for the shrieking Republicans,\u201d she tweeted on Tuesday, \u201cwho don\u2019t know the difference: concentration camps are not the same as death camps.\u201d In other words: My \u201cconcentration camp\u201d rhetoric had not-a-thang to do with the Holocaust. In fact, I wasn\u2019t even thinking about Nazi Germany and Auschwitz, you deplorable racists. Yeah, no. That\u2019s not only a lie, it\u2019s provable lie, because in her video, Ocasio-Crazy says, \u201c\u2018Never Again\u2019 means something.\u201d The phrase \u201cNever Again\u201d refers directly to the Holocaust, so the fact that she was comparing our migrant camps to the Holocaust is not even debatable, nor is the fact that she is now lying about it. But guess who do see it as debatable, who are making excuses for Ocasio-Crazy\u2019s inexcusable Holocaust comparison and\u00a0 just as inexcusable lies to cover\u00a0 it up? Yep, you guessed it: our useless, dishonest, fake newsers in the establishment media. Here\u2019s CNN\u2019s Manu Raju helping Ocasio-Crazy clean up this mess by allowing her to lie to his stupid face:  Weird how he never asks her to explain that \u201cNever Again\u201d remark, no? Oh, and here\u2019s CNN\u2019s favorite crybully, Andrew Kaczynski, breaking the fake news that Auschwitz wasn\u2019t all that bad: Aushwitz was a mixture of work and extermination camps. \u2014 andrew kaczynski (@KFILE) June 18, 2019  Hey, Kaczynski: Auschwitz also had roads, its own train station, offices, and kitchens\u2026 So Auschwitz was kinda like Six Flags, amiright? Not to be outdone, Dave Weigel, the far-left Washington Post\u2019s lead Democrat fluffer, is pretty sure that a world-class dingbat who just a few weeks ago found herself awed by the miracle of a garbage disposal, must have been referring to the Boer War:  And then there\u2019s MSNBC\u2019s Chris Hayes, who also chose to ignore the \u201cNever Again\u201d remark so he could yell at Liz Cheney: \u201cIf you spend a few minutes learning some actual history,\u201d Hayes harrumphed, \u201cyou will find out that concentration camps are different from death camps and have a history that both predates and extends far past the Nazis.\u201d  Now explain \u201cNever Again,\u201d pajama boy. So what we have here are three national news outlets so desperate to protect Ocasio-Crazy they are ignoring her \u201cNever Again\u201d reference, and we even have one CNN \u201creporter\u201d breaking the bombshell news that Auschwitz was nowhere near as bad as advertised. Is it just me or does this all qualify as \u201cenemy-of-the-people\u201d type behavior? Anyway, this has been today\u2019s episode of Democrats Sure Got It Good.",

            "author": "John Nolte",
            "content": " To begin with, there is college tuition. I graduated high school in 1984 (barely), and even during those saner times, when tuition was much more reasonable, I had no desire to go to college, primarily due to the cost. The idea of enslaving myself to a monthly payment before I even had the chance to be young and free was intolerable. Nowadays, though, tuition costs are not only insane, a number of degrees that once required four years of study, now require five. Talk about a scam. How sad to be in your early to mid-20s and already saddled with a six-figure debt. \u00a0It is even sadder if you hold a degree that will do you no good in the real world. And the entire American establishment is engineered to convince teenagers to jump into this financial abyss, but only because the entire American establishment benefits. In college, kids are politically brainwashed, which is why post-college, they are more likely than not to vote Democrat \u2014 to vote for a bigger and more intrusive government, to relish the idea of centralized control. As far as the insatiable tuition train, this is what funds these greedy left-wing universities and their staff. And then it all comes together when the crushing debt combined with the brainwashing radicalizes young people into believing government-subsidized anything (tuition, healthcare) has to be better than this. Obviously, though, that crushing misery is not enough for far-leftists like incoming Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), who is pressuring her fellow millennials to sign up for the con game that is Obamacare. In a tweet Monday, Ocasio-Cortez wrote: \u201cReminder to my fellow millennials to get your act together & buy insurance before tonight\u2019s deadline.\u201d \u201cIs open enrollment a pain? Yes. Is it expensive? Yes. But it\u2019s WAY better than being uninsured (been there) & reason enough to fight for #MedicareForAll.\u201d  At least she doesn\u2019t hide the true agenda behind Obamacare \u2014 t0 make health insurance so expensive people beg to put centralized government in charge of our health. Regardless, shame on her. Obamacare is nothing less than a con job that sucks young people dry for no valid reason. The young and healthy do need health insurance, much less the utterly useless insurance that is Obamacare. Not only are Obamacare\u2019s monthly premiums obnoxiously expensive (upwards of $1,000), so are the deductibles. The chances a young person will meet the deductible are extremely low, which means that on top of paying that crippling Obamacare premium, young people are paying for their own healthcare. Obamacare is only about wealth redistribution, to saddle the young and healthy with massive monthly premiums as a means to lower premiums for the old and sick. Originally, through the fascist mandate, the government forced you to buy health insurance. With the repeal of the mandate, you now have con artists like Ocasio-Cortez guilting and misleading young people into paying for a product they do not need. \u201c[I]t\u2019s WAY better than being uninsured.\u201d No, no, it is actually not \u201cWAY better than being uninsured.\u201d Being uninsured is WAY better because you are almost certainly going to waste thousands of dollars a year on a product you do not need. And it is worth repeating that on top of that, thanks to the deductible, you will also end up paying for whatever health care you do get. Of course there is always the unlikely (especially for the young) catastrophic situation \u2014 a cancer, heart attack, or car accident. If that is a concern, you can either look into a catastrophic health insurance plan (low monthly premium with a very high deductible) or take the risk. Me? I\u2019d take the risk, and I have taken the risk. After Obamacare outlawed my health insurance, as a grown man in my 40s, I took the risk for years. \u00a0These days, I have this as a catastrophic backup, but I still pay for all of my own healthcare out of pocket, which is a helluva lot cheaper than Obamacare. Sorry, but there is just no way I\u2019m going to allow the government to con or pressure me into paying for a lousy product I don\u2019t need. Wise up, millennails, you\u2019re not only being hoodwinked, you\u2019re being stripped of the joy and freedom that is supposed to come with being young. This country would be a lot better off if millennials stopped paying their Obamacare premiums and used that money instead to fund a wild, drunken toga party \u2014 complete with a live band and strippers. In fact, we should all do that.",

Al Green (D-TX) have insisted that Trump \u201cdoes not have to commit a crime to be impeached.\u201d In fact, Green has argued that Trump could be impeached simply for \u201charming society.\u201d \u201cIn fact, the president is not likely to be indicted, which means he\u2019s not likely to be found guilty of a crime while he\u2019s sitting, which means that if this comes before the House, it won\u2019t come before the House as a president who has been found guilty, but rather as a president who is alleged to have committed certain offenses that are onerous to the Constitution and that harm society,\u201d Green said during an August Democracy Now interview. \u201cAnd what this president is doing is harming society.\u201d Top Democrats like House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), aware that impeachment is not a popular issue among Americans, has previously said that talk of impeachment before the midterms would be a \u201cgift\u201d to Republicans. But left-wing Democrats like Ocasio-Cortez, egged on by the party\u2019s left-wing base that may not settle for anything less than impeachment if Democrats take back the House, have been ignoring Pelosi\u2019s warnings to be disciplined and not talk about impeachment before Special Counsel Robert Mueller concludes his investigation.",

Although Ocasio-Cortez and other Democrats have strongly condemned the Trump administration for going after people who stay in the country illegally, their rhetoric did not match up to the reality of Trump\u2019s plan on border enforcement. Trump announced later on Saturday that he would be delaying the administration\u2019s effort to deport more illegal aliens until both political parties can work out a bipartisan solution to solve the problems at the southern border.",

            "author": "Hannah Bleau",
            "content": " The New York lawmaker has been under fire for describing migrant detention centers as concentration camps and using phrases \u2013 like \u201cNever Again\u201d \u2013 commonly associated with the Holocaust. Despite the political backlash, she is not backing down. On Sunday, she wrote: Remember when the Bush administration bullied media into using their devised term \u201cenhanced interrogation\u201d instead of the accurate term \u201ctorture?\u201d Well, waterboarding was torture. And these are concentration camps. Journalism should be about the truth. And this is the truth. The tweet was in reference to an ABC News report featuring a physician,\u00a0Dolly Lucio Sevier, who witnessed a migrant detention center in person. She compared the conditions to \u201ctorture facilities\u201d and described it as \u201cworse than jail.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez seemed to agree with the general assessment. Sevier had access to the Ursula facility in McAllen and wrote, \u201cThe conditions within which they are held could be compared to torture facilities,\u201d ABC News reported. ABC News added:  After assessing 39 children under the age of 18, she described conditions for unaccompanied minors at the\u00a0McAllen facility\u00a0as including \u201cextreme cold temperatures, lights on 24 hours a day, no adequate access to medical care, basic sanitation, water, or adequate food.\u201d All the children who were seen showed evidence of trauma, Lucio Sevier reported, and the teens spoke of having no access to hand washing during their entire time in custody. She compared it to being \u201ctantamount to intentionally causing the spread of disease.\u201d In an interview with ABC News, Lucio Sevier said the facility \u201cfelt worse than jail.\u201d The report did not address the trauma that children experienced on their journey to the U.S.-Mexico border. Many enter facilities with existing physical and emotional issues \u2013 issues not created by the facility itself. More than 5,000 migrants were quarantined due to exposure to mumps and chicken pox in June alone. As Breitbart News reported:  And the immigrants are not the only ones affected \u2014 border officials are suffering too. \u201cTheir morale is impacted. They\u2019re tired. A lot of them have gotten sick. They\u2019ve been exposed to flu, chicken pox, measles, mumps \u2014 all kinds of challenges in terms of the medical care,\u201d Acting Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kevin McAleenan said. \u201cThey\u2019re spending time overnight in hospitals instead of patrolling the border.\u201d Overcrowding is a massive issue. In May, the Department of Homeland Security inspector general found\u00a0\u201cdangerous overcrowding\u201d at the\u00a0El Paso Del Norte Processing Center, particularly. \u201cBorder Patrol agents told us some of the detainees had been held in standing-room-only conditions for days or weeks,\u201d\u00a0the office of inspector general concluded. Breitbart News also\u00a0reported\u00a0that \u201can inspection of the facility revealed that a cell with a maximum capacity of 12 people held 76, one with a maximum capacity of eight held 41 and one with a maximum capacity of 35 held 155 people.\u201d Additionally, Breitbart News\u00a0highlighted\u00a0that facilities in the Rio Grande Valley Sector of South Texas were holding an average of 8,000 migrants per day. The overflow was so massive that Border Patrol requested\u00a0the construction of temporary shelters and began flying migrants to other processing centers in Del Rio, Texas. The GOP is placing much of the blame squarely on Democrats in Congress, who refuse to provide funding for additional bed space and other essential resources that would improve conditions. \u201cWe\u2019re doing a lot with what the Congress has given us, but again Congress refused to increase the bed space in the last appropriations bill,\u201d Vice President Mike Pence told\u00a0Face the Nation Sunday. \u201cThey continue to delay efforts on additional humanitarian support,\u201d he continued. On Saturday, Ocasio-Cortez accused the GOP of supporting the construction of \u201cmass concentration camps on the southern border.\u201d \u201cReminder this admin is CHOOSING to round up refugees seeking asylum, fighting to not give children toothpaste or soap & making people sleep on dirt floors,\u201d she tweeted, confirming the left\u2019s position on withholding money that could improve conditions of the overcrowded facilities. \u201cThey say it\u2019s bc of a lack of money,\u201d she wrote. \u201cYou know what saves money?

She similarly told the Washington Post: \u201cI wasn\u2019t born to a wealthy or powerful family \u2014 mother from Puerto Rico, dad from the South Bronx. I was born in a place where your Zip code determines your destiny.\u201d The congressional candidate, who pulled off an upset win against high-ranking establishment Rep. Joe Crowley (D-NY), was indeed born in New York City\u2019s Bronx borough. She currently lives there, too. So what\u2019s the issue? Ocasio-Cortez omits that for most of her formative years, she was actually raised in one of the United States\u2019 wealthiest counties. Around the age of five, Alexandria\u2019s architect father\u00a0Sergio Ocasio moved the family from the \u201cplanned community\u201d of Parkchester in the Bronx to a home in Yorktown Heights, a wealthy suburb in\u00a0Westchester County. The New York Times describes her childhood home as \u201ca modest two-bedroom house on a quiet street.\u201d In a 1999\u00a0profile of the area, when Ocasio-Cortez would have been ten years old, the Times\u00a0lauded Yorktown Heights\u2019 \u201cdiversity of housing in a scenic setting\u201d \u2013 complete with two golf courses. The paper quoted\u00a0Linda Cooper, the town supervisor, describing Yorktown as \u201da folksy area where people can come, kick off their shoes, wander around, sit in a cafe, listen to a concert in the park, or go to the theater.\u201d In a fun coincidence, Yorktown, which contains Yorktown Heights, is also home to a 436-acre state park named after \u2013 yes, one Donald J. Trump. After high school,\u00a0Ocasio-Cortez studied international relations and economics at\u00a0Boston University and worked for Sen.\u00a0Edward M. Kennedy (D-MA). Only after college did\u00a0Ocasio-Cortez return to the Parkchester complex, where she launched\u00a0Brook Avenue Press, a publishing\u00a0group aimed at improving the public image of the Bronx. Westchester County \u2013 which the\u00a0Washington Post,\u00a0in a glowing profile on Ocasio-Cortez, describes as only \u201cmiddle class\u201d \u2013\u00a0ranks #8 in the nation for the counties with the \u201chighest average incomes among the wealthiest one percent of residents.\u201d According to the\u00a0Economic Policy Institute, the county\u2019s average annual income of the top one percent is a staggering $4,326,049. Yorktown Heights, specifically, offers a sharp contrast from Bronx living. According to USA.com, the town\u2019s population is 81 percent white, and\u00a0median household income is $96,413 \u2013 nearly double the average for both New York state and the nation, according to data from 2010-2014. The 28-year-old\u2019s far-left platform includes abolishing ICE, universal guaranteed employment, and Medicare for all. In an interview with CNN,\u00a0Ocasio-Cortez said she supports impeaching President Trump, despite warnings from Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) to avoid the issue.",

            "author": "John Binder",
            "content": " Last week,\u00a0Ocasio delivered an upset to establishment Democratic power player\u00a0Rep. Joe Crowley (D-NY) in the district\u2019s primary election, running on a platform that\u00a0promises\u00a0to abolish all immigration and border enforcement. Now, in an interview with AJ+, owned by the Al Jazeera Media Network, Ocasio says that not only should the U.S. abolish the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency \u2014 which is tasked with enforcing interior immigration laws \u2014 but that foreign nationals, border crossers, and illegal aliens\u00a0are entitled to enter the U.S. Ocasio said: I think that immigration should be safe. I think that we should grant people a safe and documented right of passage. Republicans try all these scare tactics. And they go \u2018Oh, open borders.\u2019 Because they\u2019re trying to incite fear. But what we really need to do is demilitarize a lot of what\u2019s going on in terms of the detention of people, which has been happening for a very long time by the way. [Emphasis added] So I think that when we talk about replacing it with a system, we talk about having a system that is safe, that documents people effectively, that is also not rooted in the discrimination that our immigration system was initially built on. [Emphasis added] The first immigration law in the United States was the Chinese Exclusion Act. The first law about immigration in the United States was about how do we exclude a specific type of people. And our immigration system has really kind of evolved from that initial root and I don\u2019t think it necessarily has to be that way. [Emphasis added]  Ocasio is increasingly shaping the Democratic Party\u2019s open borders platform ahead of the 2018 midterm elections. Since her beating of Crowley in the Bronx,\u00a0Democrats\u00a0in the House and Senate, along with progressive liberals like\u00a0Cynthia Nixon\u00a0in New York, have been demanding ICE be abolished and all immigration enforcement be ended. House Democrats are now\u00a0crafting\u00a0legislation that would officially abolish ICE, while Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) has been purged from the Democratic party for failing to endorse the \u201cabolish ICE\u201d campaign like his fellow left-wingers such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). The latest Harvard/Harris\u00a0Poll, though, reveals that swing voters are overwhelmingly opposed to the Democrats\u2019 plan to end all immigration enforcement across the U.S. Nearly 3-in-4 swing voters, about 73 percent, said they do not want ICE to be disbanded, as Breitbart News reported. Less than 30 percent of swing voters said they support the abolishment of ICE. Even Democrat voters are opposed to the abolishment of ICE.\u00a0Nearly 60 percent of Democrats said they do not want ICE to be disbanded. Abolishing the deportation agency, as\u00a0Breitbart News\u00a0reported, would have allowed more than 1.6 million illegal aliens to have gone free throughout the U.S. in the last five years. ",

But she kept doubling down and digging in, first insisting the detention camps met the definition of \u201cconcentration camps\u201d; then trying to draw a distinction between \u201cconcentration camps\u201d and \u201cdeath camps\u201d; then arguing that the U.S. had also used \u201cconcentration camps\u201d when President Franklin Delano Roosevelt (a Democrat) interned Japanese-Americans during the Second World War. She also spent hours retweeting supportive messages from those on the left who attempted to defend her use of the \u201cconcentration camp\u201d analogy.

It\u2019s unacceptable.\u201d House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (D-CA) likewise said that she should apologize. Ocasio-Cortez tweeted, apparently in response, that she would never apologize:  Ocasio-Cortez also thanked House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) for arguing that the phrase \u201cnever again\u201d could be interpreted more broadly. (Nadler told Breitbart News in 2016 that Democrats who used antisemitism to attack Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) should be fired.) On Wednesday morning, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) refused to condemn Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s statement. It was the second time in recent weeks that she has had to defend a member of her caucus accused of antisemitism: she also protected Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) after repeated antisemitic remarks. ",

Joe Crowley (D-NY), a member of the party\u2019s leadership team under Pelosi, in last year\u2019s primary race. The latest spat began on Saturday, when columnist Maureen Dowd of the\u00a0New York Times reported that Pelosi had disparaged AOC and her allies on the left (original links): I asked Pelosi whether, after being the subject of so many you-go-girl memes for literally clapping back at Trump, it was jarring to get a bad headline like the one in HuffPost that day \u2014 \u201cWhat The Hell Is Nancy Pelosi Doing?\u201d The article described the outrage of the Squad, as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts are known. Pelosi feels that the four made themselves irrelevant to the process by voting against \u201cour bill,\u201d as she put it, which she felt was the strongest one she could get. \u201cAll these people have their public whatever and their Twitter world,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they didn\u2019t have any following. They\u2019re four people and that\u2019s how many votes they got.\u201d AOC responded on Twitter by calling out Pelosi for her past efforts to disparage the party\u2019s \u201cdemocratic socialist\u201d wing:  On Wednesday, Pelosi held a meeting with her caucus in which she reportedly insisted on party unity, and discouraged House members from tweeting criticisms of each other or the leadership. Asked by reporters whether she regretted criticizing AOC in public, Pelosi said: \u201cRegrets is [sic] not what I do.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez did not tweet. But she did talk to the\u00a0Washington Post, the newspaper of record in the capital city: \u201cWhen these comments first started, I kind of thought that she was keeping the progressive flank at more of an arm\u2019s distance in order to protect more moderate members, which I understood,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez told The Washington Post. \u201cBut the persistent singling out .\u2009.\u2009.\u00a0it got to a point where it was just outright disrespectful .\u2009.\u2009. the explicit singling out of newly elected women of color.\u201d The\u00a0Post noted that even though Pelosi had posed with AOC and other \u201cJustice Democrats\u201d on the cover of Rolling Stone earlier this year, the two have not spoken \u201cone-on-one\u201d since February.  Pelosi was apparently upset that Ocasio-Cortez had declined to serve on a select committee on climate change, preferring to launch her own \u201cGreen New Deal.",

            "author": "Robert Kraychik",
            "content": " Obama said: We did not adapt quickly enough to the fact that there were people being left behind [by globalization] and that frustrations were going to flare up and that all these changes were happening really quickly, and you had to address them and speak to them. In those environments, you then start getting a different kind of politics. You start getting politics that\u2019s based on, \u201cThat person\u2019s not like me, and it must be their fault,\u201d and you start getting a politics based on a nationalism that\u2019s not pride in country, but hatred for somebody on the other side of the border, and you start getting the kind of politics that does not allow for compromise because it\u2019s based on passions and emotions and identities. When I hear people say they don\u2019t like identity politics, I think it\u2019s important to remember that identity politics doesn\u2019t just apply when it\u2019s black people or gay people or women. The folks who really originated identity politics were the folks who sad three-fifths clause and all that stuff. That was identity politics. That\u2019s still out there. Jim Crow was identity politics. That\u2019s where it started. WATCH:  Obama lamented the news media diversification following the rise of the Internet. He said a \u201ccommon set of facts\u201d \u2014 previously delivered by consensus via the Associated Press, Washington Post, New York Times, ABC, CBS, and NBC \u2014 was lost following the arrival of Rush Limbaugh and Fox News on the news media landscape. He said: There are a range of reasons why [\u201cthe overlapping ideological spectrum in each party\u201d] changed. Some of it had to do with, frankly, the shift in the media because in 1981, your news cycle was still governed by the stories that were going to be filed by AP, the Washington Post, maybe the New York Times, and the three broadcast stations. Whether it was Cronkite or Brinkley, or what have you, there was a common set of facts, a baseline around which both parties had to adapt and respond to, and by the time I take office, what you increasingly have is a media environment in which if you are a Fox News viewer, you have an entirely different reality than if you are a New York Times reader. It means the basis of each respective party [has] become more ideological. WATCH:  Obama also said Trump lacks \u201creverence\u201d for the Oval Office: When I walked into the Oval Office, there\u2019s a reverence there for that office that is independent of you, and if you don\u2019t feel that, then you shouldn\u2019t be there because a lot of fights, a lot of sacrifices, a lot of bloodshed is represented in that office \u2014 not just soldiers in Iwo Jima. It\u2019s maids in Selma, workers in a coal mine. It\u2019s farmers in the Dust Bowl. You\u2019re carrying that vessel, and I never lost that reverence for that office, and every day I would come, and I would say, \u201cI\u2019m going to make mistakes. There are going to be decisions that are compromises.\u201d \u2026 Through all those ups and downs, you had to have a part of you \u2014 and the Bushes had that, and Ronald Reagan had that, and Bill Clinton had that \u2014 that sense of, \u201cThis is sacred. This is important.\u201d And there\u2019s a civic religion and a set of ideals and principles that we won\u2019t get perfect, but we should strive to perfect, and that is something I never lost throughout the time I was there. Both Meacham and Obama refused to say Trump\u2019s name, despite both referring to him implicitly. \u201cHe\u2019s Voldemort. I\u2019m not going to say his name,\u201d Meacham said of Trump while asking Obama a question about Trump\u2019s presidency. Neither Baker nor Meacham challenged Obama\u2019s comments. ",

During an appearance on Huntsville, AL radio\u2019s WVNN on Thursday, Rogers speculated that if former President Barack Obama were one of the candidates in the 2020 Democratic presidential field, he would not win the party nomination for not being \u201csocialist enough.\u201d \u201cI hear it everywhere I go in my district \u2013 people do see them as the face of the future Democrat Party, and they see these presidential debates, and they see how far left they\u2019re going with their rhetoric,\u201d Rogers said on \u201cThe Jeff Poor Show.\u201d \u201cI just spoke to a civic group in Alex City today at lunch, and I told them \u2013 and I really mean this \u2013 Barack Obama could not win the nomination in this year\u2019s Democrat field. He is not socialist enough to win. That\u2019s how far left they\u2019ve moved. So yeah, when I hear Omar and AOC and Tlaib all talking, I want them to keep it up because it is turning off Americans from coast to coast.\u201d Rogers was still optimistic about Republicans chances of picking up the House in 2020 and warned not to read too much into the recent wave of Republican retirements. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have any effect on it,\u201d he added. \u201cOne of the things that drives me nuts about the national news media is they spin these things to support a narrative they\u2019re promoting. The fact that is we\u2019re not having a larger retirement than we usually have.\u00a0 If you take the last three-and-a-half years and you compare it to the previous three-and-a-half years, it\u2019s the same percentage. Every August recess, we have a lot of people announce they\u2019re retiring in part because they get back home in August and realize \u2018I like being home. I don\u2019t want to do this anymore.\u2019 It\u2019s a tough way of life. There\u2019s a lot of time away from your family. A lot of time spent fundraising. Social media has made it just a nightmare to have to be in these jobs because people just beat the crap out of you constantly, cable news. A lot of folks just don\u2019t want to do this for a long time.\u201d \u201cBut this is nothing out of the ordinary,\u201d he continued. \u201cOne of the things I would urge your audience to look at in the future because I\u2019ve been doing this 17 years now, and I\u2019ve seen this pattern: Every August, especially right at the end of August you get a lot of people announce they\u2019re retiring because they\u2019ve been home for a month and they like being out of Washington and back home. And then after every Christmas break, we have a wave of announcements for the same reason \u2013 people are back home with their family. They realize they like the private life and they want to go back to it. So there is nothing unusual about what\u2019s happening right now.",

But more than what we did, I\u2019m proud of how they\u2019re continuing to fight for an America that\u2019s better,\u201d Obama, who has largely remained silent about the Trump presidency, wrote on Twitter.  In a\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0op-ed published Friday, the ex-Obama administration members wrote they \u201cwitnessed firsthand the relentless attacks on the legitimacy of President Barack Obama and his family\u201d from their \u201cfront-row seats to America\u2019s first black presidency.\u201d The op-ed reads: Witnessing racism surge in our country, both during and after Obama\u2019s service and ours, has been a shattering reality, to say the least. But it has also provided jet-fuel for our activism, especially in moments such as these. We\u2019ve heard this before. Go back where you came from. Go back to Africa. And now, \u2018send her back.\u2019\u00a0Black and brown people in America don\u2019t hear these chants in a vacuum; for many of us,\u00a0we\u2019ve felt\u00a0their full force being shouted in our faces, whispered behind our backs, scrawled across lockers, or hurled at us online. They are part of a pattern in our country designed to denigrate us as well as keep us separate and afraid. The Obama-era officials then expressed support for the four progressive lawmakers, accusing President Trump of being\u00a0\u201ccomplicit in the poisoning of our democracy.\u201d \u201cWe stand with congresswomen Ilhan Omar, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ayanna Pressley and Rashida Tlaib, as well as all those currently under attack by President Trump. There is truly nothing more un-American than calling on fellow citizens to leave our country,\u201d the wrote. Earlier this month, President Trump challenged the \u201cSquad\u201d to leave the U.S., citing their frequent verbal attacks on the country, writing on Twitter: \u201cWhy don\u2019t they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came. Then come back and show us how it is done.\u201d During a recent campaign rally in Greenville, North Carolina, President Trump\u2019s supporters broke out into a \u201csend her back\u201d chant about Omar, sending Democrats and the establishment media into a tizzy. The president later said he was \u201cnot happy\u201d about the chants, and Vice President Mike Pence suggested the president may stop them in the future. Absent from the op-ed was any mention of various inflammatory and antisemitic comments made by the \u201cSquad.\u201d Omar has repeatedly sparked political firestorms for her anti-Israel comments and pushing anti-Jewish tropes. The Minnesota Democrat has suggested pro-Israel advocacy groups bribe members of Congress to support the Jewish state. In a 2012 tweet, Omar claimed\u00a0Israel\u00a0had \u201chypnotized the world.\u201d Tlaib has attacked opponents of the anti-Israel BDS movement by claiming, \u201cthey forgot what country they represent,\u201d inferring they hold foreign allegiances. In May, the Michigan Democrat\u00a0said\u00a0Palestinians provided \u201csafe haven\u201d for Jews following the Holocaust. However, it is widely known\u00a0Palestinian leaders, including former Grand Mufti of Jerusalem Hajj Muhammad Amin Al-Husseini, collaborated openly with Adolf Hitler. She has also met with Abbas Hamideh, a Hezbollah supporter who has described Israel as a \u201cterrorist entity.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez has come under fire for trivializing the Holocaust by comparing immigrant detention centers to concentration camps. Senior White House advisor Stephen Miller, who is Jewish, recently criticized the New York Democrat for likening the two, saying they\u00a0minimized the \u201cdeath of six million of my Jewish brothers and sisters.\u201d",

            "content": " Obama offered his thoughts during a May 30, 2019, speech while participating in\u00a0VTEX DAY in San Paulo, Brazil. The Daily Mail quoted Obama saying, \u201cGun laws in the United States don\u2019t make much sense. Anybody can buy any weapon, anytime without, you know, without much if any regulation. They can buy over the Internet. They can buy machine guns.\u201d There are\u00a0 number of problems with Obama\u2019s claims. The first is the assertion anybody \u201ccan buy any weapon, anytime\u2026without much if any regulation.\u201d This is simply untrue. Firearms are highly regulated in the U.S. via background checks for retail point of sales, registration requirements in states like California and New York, and mandated waiting periods for gun purchases in numerous states as well. Down Range with AWR Hawkins.  Sign up today! Moreover, possession of a firearm is highly regulated requiring Firearm Owners Identication (FOID) cards or other licensing schemes in various states. One cannot even possess a gun in his home without such a card in states like Illinois or without first getting a certificate from the government in states like California. Obama\u2019s claim that guns can be purchased over the internet is spurious as well as it is legal for retailers to advertise and accept payment for a gun over the internet but they cannot ship a gun directly to a buyer. Rather, the gun has to be shipped to a Federal Firearm License holder (FFL) near the buyer so a background check can be performed before the buyer is allowed to take possession of the gun. Lastly, Obama suggested it is easy to buy machine guns in the U.S. He made this statement in the context of talking about the December 14, 2012, attack on Sandy Hook Elementary School, in which machine guns were not used. Nevertheless, Obama broached the subject but did not mention that machine guns are regulated under the National Firearms Act (1934), which means the purchase of one requires a background check, the submission of fingerprints and photographs, the payment of a $200 federal tax, and registering with the weapon with the federal bureaucracy. This process takes eight to nine months to complete. Moreover, the only machine guns that legally be purchased are those built prior to May 1986, therefore there is a limited number of them available. This means the cost of such a weapon often runs in the tens of thousands. Obama did not mention any of these things when suggesting machine guns are too easy to buy in America.",

Seriously, think about it: the Washington Post \u201cbombshell\u201d on President Trump updating Obama\u2019s golf simulator, and doing so with his own money, just proves once again how useless and corrupt the establishment media are. Gee, what a crack team of inspiring investigative journalists America is blessed with. At long last, even though he has been out of office for two years, we have finally been told Barry had a golf simulator installed in the White House. And this is real news, because it is a first. Before Barry, there had never been a golf simulator in the White House. So it was Bill Ayers\u2019 Friend who set a national precedent, and thanks to a dogged and persistent Washington Post, we now know this truth, we finally have all the facts, because democracy dies in darkness n\u2019 stuff. But with its stupid bombshell about Trump\u2019s golf simulator, all the far-left Post is doing is admitting it did not report on Obama\u2019s golf simulator, is admitting that were it not for the Post\u2019s obsessive hatred of Trump, the public never would have learned about Obama\u2019s golf simulator. Jimmy Carter made a point of posing as a workaholic and look at the job he did, so as someone who only cares about results and could not care less about how much time a Obama or Trump play golf or vacation or enjoy \u201cexecutive time,\u201d my only takeaway from the from the Post bombshell was: Look at what it takes to force the corrupt media to report on something they did not want us to know about Obama. If the installation of golf simulators at the White House is such a big deal \u2014 and anyone looking at today\u2019s media coverage can only assume it is a Watergate-level Big Deal \u2014 why are we just finding out now that Obama not only enjoyed a golf simulator but was the first president in history to install one? We all know the answer: the Washington Post, along with the rest of the unethical and inept corporate media, had no curiosity when it comes to Obama; and when the media did accidently discover something out about Obama they did not want the public to know, the media covered it up \u2014 like this photo of Obama hanging out with anti-Semitic hate preacher Louis Farrakhan. My guess, and it is a safe one, is that almost everyone in the national political media knew about Obama\u2019s golf simulator but chose to not report because they knew his critics would have a field day with it. And so, if you read between the lines. all the Washington Post reported on yesterday, all the Washington Post revealed with its big scoop about Trump\u2019s golf simulator, is just how awful, unreliable, biased, lazy, and worthless the media have always been.

            "content": " David Axelrod, former adviser to President Barack Obama, tweeted: \u201cWith his deliberate, racist outburst, @realDonaldTrump wants to raise the profile of his targets, drive Dems to defend them and make them emblematic of the entire party. It\u2019s a cold, hard strategy.\u201d That is debatable \u2014 but if so, Axelrod should know; Obama did it first. By 2011, Obama knew that re-election would be difficult. The Tea Party had just led the Republicans to a historic victory in the 2010 midterm elections, winning the House and nearly taking the Senate. The economy was only growing sluggishly, and Obama\u2019s stimulus had failed to keep unemployment below eight percent, as projected. Moreover, the passage of Obamacare had provoked a backlash against Obama\u2019s state-centered model of American society. Facing a similar situation in the mid-1990s, President Bill Clinton had \u201ctriangulated,\u201d moving back toward the middle, frustrating the GOP by taking up their issues, such as welfare reform. But Obama rejected that approach. Having watched his icon, Chicago mayor Harold Washington, settle for an incremental approach when faced with opposition in the 1980s, only to die of a sudden heart attack before fulfilling his potential, Obama chose the path of hard-left policy \u2014 and divide-and-rule politics. The first hint of his strategy emerged during the debt ceiling negotiations in the summer of August 2011. As Bob Woodward recounted in his book about the crisis,\u00a0The Price of Politics, then-Speaker of the House John Boehner (R-OH) had wanted to reach a \u201cgrand bargain\u201d with the president on long-term spending cuts. But Obama blew up that agreement by demanding $400 billion in new taxes, to his aides\u2019 surprise. Obama wanted an opponent, not a deal. (Last week, Boehner told\u00a0Breitbart News Tonight that Obama\u2019s decision was his worst disappointment in 35 years of politics.) In the fall of 2011, a new left-wing movement, Occupy Wall Street, was launched. A mix of communists, anarchists, and digital pranksters, the Occupy movement\u00a0cast American society as a struggle between the \u201c99 percent\u201d and the \u201cone percent.\u201d Obama and then-House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) embraced the movement \u2014 and failed to distance themselves from it even as it collapsed into violence, sexual assault, and confrontations with police. Instead, Obama picked up on Occupy\u2019s themes and used them to shape his campaign. In December 2011, Obama gave a speech at Osawatomie, Kansas \u2014 a place steeped in radical symbolism \u2014 at which he doubled down on his left-wing policies. He focused on the issue of economic inequality, and attacked the idea that the free market could lift the middle class to prosperity. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about class warfare. This is about the nation\u2019s welfare,\u201d he insisted. Then, in the spring of 2012, Obama made a controversial play on race. When a black teen, Trayvon Martin, was killed in Florida during a scuffle with neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman, Al Sharprton \u2014 who was serving as an informal adviser to Obama at the time \u2014 made the local crime story into a national racial controversy. Obama, following Sharpton\u2019s lead, weighed in:\u00a0\u201cIf I had a son, he\u2019d look like Trayvon,\u201d Obama said at the time. Poll numbers suggest that race relations, which had been improving, dropped precipitously after that. But to Obama, it was worth it: the campaign needed to find a way to motivate minority voters. (Vice President Joe Biden did his part, telling black voters that GOP nominee Mitt Romney was \u201cgonna put y\u2019all in chains.\u201d) Trump is pushing a non-racial, nationalist message. But if he actually wanted to divide America for political gain, he could learn from the master.",

            "content": " History is already revealing him to be one of the worst presidents in history, certainly in my lifetime (and I lived through the Carter years), but that he was a brilliant politician is not in doubt. I\u2019ll never forget the moment I knew Obama would be president. It was right after his Republican rival, Sen. John McCain, lost his ever-loving mind and quit the presidential campaign to go and save the economy. Immediately after McCain jumped on his white horse with nowhere to go, Obama called a press conference. But Obama was cool, you see. In his remarks, he said nothing about McCain. Then he opened things up for questions knowing McCain\u2019s madness would be the first question, and it was, and this is when Obama dropped the nuke: \u201cI think it is going to be part of the president\u2019s job to be able to deal with more than one thing at once.\u2019\u2019 That\u2019s how you win presidential elections. Obama did the same thing to Romney; time and again and again, Obama and his campaign emasculated the former Massachusetts governor. Romney almost constantly allowed himself to be on defense, to look weak and in a crouch. And whenever Romney tried to launch an offensive, he sounded shrill and desperate. Obama was a godawful president, but he played the role of president brilliantly. No question. Now watch the fake Hispanic Beto O\u2019Rourke launch his presidential campaign. The guy\u2019s a spaz, and how awkward is it watching his heiress wife count Beto\u2019s ear hairs:  More spaz-o-rama:  Forget about the drivel coming out of his mouth and watch him: watch Beto\u2019s body language, listen to the world salad\u2026 Obama always came off as calm, collected, No Drama Obama. O\u2019Rourke behaves like a male cheerleader at a college game. He\u2019s the ultimate beta male. And just so no one can accuse me of political bias, Marco Rubio had much of the same problem in 2016. Believe it or not, becoming president has nothing to do with policy, experience, or character or any of that stuff\u2026 Those things are addressed in the primaries. Sure, there are partisans on both sides who will vote for their guy no matter what, but it is still the 15 to 25 percent of the unaffiliated who choose our president \u2014 and going back to John F. Kennedy, to 1960 when television took over the messaging of political campaigns, it is the alpha male who has always won the presidency. By the way, this doesn\u2019t mean a woman can\u2019t become president. \u201cAlpha male\u201d is a figure of speech, shorthand for the poise, command, unflappable, and in charge. Hillary probably would have stomped all over Rubio or John Kasich. Her problem was that Donald Trump beat her soundly in that facet of the campaign. Don\u2019t confuse this observation with a 2020 prediction, an election that will almost certainly be decided in the same way all presidential re-election campaigns are decided \u2014 on the state of the economy. If we hit a recession next year, Boy George could probably beat Trump. What\u2019s more, O\u2019Rourke could toughen up during the primary, work on his presentation\u2026 My only point is that this worshipful comparing O\u2019Rourke to Obama is a more than a tad delusional right now. Yes, they share some of the same qualities, but the key one, the one that wins all the marbles is, to say the least, lacking. Obama was many things, but he was no spaz. Beto is a total spaz. ",

Obama commented on his understanding of the founding of the United States during the\u00a0VTEXDAY 2019 conference in Sao Paulo, Brazil on Wednesday. Obama said that the Constitution gave America the means of inclusion through Democracy. \u201cThe more people we included, the more successful we became,\u201d he said. Obama used a basketball analogy to illustrate his point, pointing out that the NBA was better than ever by including more international players like Giannis Antetokounmpo, a Nigerian from Greece who plays for the Milwaukee Bucks. \u201cNow he\u2019s one of the best players in the world,\u201d Obama said, pointing out that if the NBA did not include international players, they were leaving talent on the field. \u201cIf you don\u2019t include women, you are leaving talent on the field,\u201d Obama said, saying it was in every country\u2019s interest to \u201cinclude everyone.\u201d He admitted that \u201cperfect equality\u201d was difficult to achieve, because of natural talent and work ethic. \u201cThe issue is not perfect equality, the issue is, are those of us who are successful willing to give back enough to provide a ladder of opportunity for others that are coming behind us,\u201d he said. Obama continued with a discussion about the wealthy, asserting after a family obtained enough money to eat, buy a house, send their kids to college, and take a vacation once in a while, additional financial wealth would not make people happy. He acknowledged that he now had more money than he ever had in his life, and claimed he could not spend it all if he tried. \u201cIt\u2019s not money that is making me happy, but we teach ourselves that our measure of success is the more we have, the harder we hang onto it, the better we must be, the higher our status is,\u201d he said. Obama said that the concept of wealth and status in the United States was what made societies less equal. \u201cWe have to redesign our minds to say that we\u2019re at our most powerful and influential when we\u2019re able to help others,\u201d he concluded. Obama clarified that he still supported the concept of capitalism but called for a \u201crevolution of values\u201d to create a better, more equal society that was more environmentally stable. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to do us much good to have really wonderful apps and great virtual reality when the actual reality of the planet is getting hotter, and the oceans are rising, and the forests are getting cut down, and we can\u2019t breathe,\u201d he said.",

Obama\u2019s former secretary for the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Julian Castro criticized Obama\u2019s former Department of Homeland Secretary, saying that his concern about decriminalizing crossing the border illegally was merely a \u201cright-wing talking point.\u201d He also criticized the Obama administration for high rates of deportation of illegal immigrants, challenging Joe Biden for failing to intervene. De Blasio also pressed Biden on why he did not advise Obama to slow deportation during the administration. \u201cDid you say those deportations were a good idea or did you go to the president and say, \u2018this is a mistake, we shouldn\u2019t do it,'\u201d he said. \u201cWhich one?\u201d Biden defended Obama for trying to pass comprehensive immigration reform but vowed that he would \u201cabsolutely not\u201d resume similar deportation rates as the Obama administration.

Biden reminded Castro that he also served in the Obama administration. \u201cI never heard him talk about any of this when he was the secretary,\u201d he said pointedly. But even Biden found himself implicitly criticizing Obama\u2019s proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) deal, which Trump killed, when asked if he would rejoin the proposed trade agreement with Asian nations. \u201cI would not rejoin the TPP as it was initially put forward,\u201d he said. Biden also criticized the surge of troops in Afghanistan, which took place in 2009 under President Obama. \u201cI opposed the surge in Afghanistan,\u201d he said, adding that he felt going into Afghanistan was a mistake. Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard also criticized both parties for allowing the war in Afghanistan to continue. \u201cFor too long, we\u2019ve had leaders who have been arbitrating foreign policy from ivory towers in Washington without any idea about the cost and the consequence, the toll that it takes on our service members, on their families,\u201d she said. Ultimately, Biden reminded his political rivals that Obama was the one that chose him as the vice president. \u201cEverybody is talking about how terrible I am on these issues. Barack Obama knew exactly who I was,\u201d he said, noting that he was fully vetted as vice president. \u201cHe chose me, and he said it was the best decision he made. I\u2019ll take his judgment.\u201d After the debate, Obama\u2019s former Attorney General Eric Holder cautioned Democrats for their attacks against the Obama administration. \u201cTo my fellow Democrats. Be wary of attacking the Obama record,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cBuild on it. Expand it.

A couple of points: 1. Straw purchases are already banned. ATF background check form 4473 makes clear the person trying to buy a gun must, in fact, be the actual purchaser in order for the purchase to be approved. 2. California has had universal background checks for over two decades, yet the state continues to catch national attention for high profile shooting after high profile shooting. 3. There is no gun show loophole. Never has been. The majority of sales at gun shows go through an FFL (Federal Firearms License holder).

We do this by a tax on Wall Street speculation,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think 11 years ago we bailed out the crooks on Wall Street, it\u2019s appropriate for Wall Street now to help all the working families in this country,\u201d he said. Sanders in July said he would cancel all of the nearly $1.6 trillion of existing student loan debt owed by roughly 45 million Americans as a bailout for millennials and the working class, according to Politico. Sanders\u2019 higher education plan \u2014 canceling debt and free college \u2014 would cost $2.2 trillion. His campaign said the tax on Wall Street speculation would generate more than $2.4 trillion over the next decade. Some moderate Democrats have criticized that proposal, arguing that it would burden the wealthy and middle-class to help the working class, or that it would raise the national debt, which is currently $23 trillion. Before the debate, President Trump\u2019s reelection campaign flew a plane with a banner that read: \u201cSocialism Will Kill Houston\u2019s Economy.

Instead, he claimed that the socialism he supported was \u201cwhat goes on in Canada and Scandinavia, guaranteeing healthcare to all people as a human right.\u201d Under Maduro, Venezuela\u2019s constitution refers to healthcare as a \u201cfundamental social right, an obligation of the state [to provide], as part of the right to life.\u201d Late dictator Hugo Ch\u00e1vez nationalized all hospitals in 2013, the year he died and Maduro took over. Since then, Venezuelan hospitals have suffered enormous shortages in medicine and key medical equipment. As many as 85 percent of pharmacies in Venezuela have no medicine and the country faces chronic shortages of nearly every medicine on the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) list of drugs necessary to run a functional healthcare system. Maduro has repeatedly blocked humanitarian aid shipments from entering the country. In February, the same month Maduro arrested Jorge Ramos for asking about the status of political prisoners under his regime, Sanders told CNN that Venezuela still enjoyed \u201cdemocratic operations,\u201d refusing to call Maduro a dictator. \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say that the last election was undemocratic, but there are still democratic operations taking place in that country,\u201d Sanders said during a town hall discussion. Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz, a Sanders campaign co-chair and mayor of San Juan, Puerto Rico, refused to condemn the human rights situation in Venezuela during an interview with Jorge Ramos in July. She also attempted to distance Sanders from the \u201csocialist\u201d moniker, saying she did not use it herself because, \u201cespecially for Latinos,\u201d socialism is often equated to \u201cauthoritarianism.\u201d While Sanders called Maduro a \u201ctyrant\u201d on Thursday, Maduro has had kind words for Sanders. In 2016, Maduro condemned the United States as a dictatorship, claiming that the fact that \u201cour revolutionary friend\u201d Sanders did not win the Democratic primary that year was proof that \u201cin the United States, the people do not have social rights.",

Barack Obama (D-IL) a few days before the 2008 election, when he declared that his goal was \u201cfundamentally transforming the United States of America.\u201d The socialist senator from neighboring Vermont told the enthusiastic crowd that while many of his ideas would be labeled as radical, many of them were now being adopted across the country. He cited his proposal, four years ago, to provide free tuition for community college, which he noted many cities and states were now considering.

One woman asked Sanders about the Trump administration\u2019s recent overhaul of the Endangered Species Act. He replied: \u201cMy God, we are losing specie after specie [sic], it\u2019s a terrible thing.\u201d A left-wing Jewish supporter from Vermont asked Sanders what he would do to end the Israeli \u201coccupation.\u201d He said that the U.S. should use its financial leverage over Israel to oppose its \u201cracism,\u201d though he also said Palestinian leaders were \u201ccorrupt.\u201d He said the U.S. should \u201cuse our clout to bring people together\u201d for peace in the region. Asked what he would do about jobs in the private health insurance industry, Sanders acknowledged there would need to be a \u201ctransition,\u201d and that the focus would be on training people to deliver actual health care, rather than administrative functions: \u201cWe don\u2019t need more people sitting around a desk\u201d evaluating insurance claims, he said. One supporter asked why Sanders had supported Hillary Clinton after a corrupt Democratic nomination process \u2014 what he called \u201cone of the biggest stolen elections in our political history.\u201d Sanders said that he did not see it that way: while the superdelegate system was corrupt, he said, there was a binary choice between Clinton and Trump.

Sanders did not elaborate on what he meant by \u201cracism.\u201d To many anti-Israel activists and Arab states, the very existence of Israel, and the Zionist ideology of Jewish national self-determination, is by definition racist. Previously, Sanders has referred to the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as \u201cracist.\u201d Sanders has also suggested that he would move the U.S. embassy in Israel back from Jerusalem to Tel Aviv.",

CNN reported Monday evening that the Twitter account had supported Sanders and it had expressed \u201cextreme\u201d left-wing views. In a statement released Tuesday evening, veteran Sanders campaign aide Jeff Weaver said: Anyone who thinks that political change should come from the barrel of a gun is anathema to what Bernie has advocated for decades \u2014 non-violent mass political action. Senator Sanders and our entire campaign are repulsed by the despicable massacres we have witnessed. We asked Donald Trump to condemn white nationalism and anti immigrant [sic] demonization. We are not holding our breath.  President Trump\u2019s statement on Monday from the White House in fact included an explicit denunciation of white supremacy: \u201d In one voice, our nation must condemn racism, bigotry, and white supremacy.\u00a0 These sinister ideologies must be defeated.\u00a0 Hate has no place in America.\u201d In August 2017, after the Charlottesville riots, President Trump made a similar statement: \u201cRacism is evil. \u00a0And those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans.\u201d He has been critical of illegal aliens, but not immigrants in general. There is no evidence to suggest that Trump inspired the El Paso shooter in any way. In a manifesto posted online that is widely attributed to the shooter, he stated: \u201cMy ideology has not changed for several years.

            "author": "Hannah Bleau",
            "content": " Sanders calls climate change the\u00a0\u201csingle greatest challenge facing our country,\u201d citing\u00a0\u201cextreme\u201d weather phenomena like floods, droughts, wildfires, and hurricanes, despite the fact that those occurrences have existed since the beginning of time. Sanders even suggests that climate change has a racial element to it, arguing the effects of climate change affect \u201ccommunities of color,\u201d particularly. He warns \u201cimmediate\u201d action is necessary, likening the \u201ccrisis\u201d to the challenges former President Franklin D. Roosevelt faced in the 1940s, leading to the creation of the New Deal. Sanders\u2019 plan promises to effectively reverse the \u201ccrisis\u201d while simultaneously creating 20 million jobs and reaching\u00a0\u201c100 percent renewable energy for electricity and transportation by no later than 2030 and complete decarbonization by at least 2050,\u201d per the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s guidelines. A $16.3 trillion public investment is necessary to make those goals a reality, which falls in line with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), who said any viable climate change plan needed to come with a $10 trillion price tag \u2013 at least\u2013 in order to \u201chave a shot.\u201d Sanders says we must \u201cdirectly invest a historic $16.3 trillion public investment toward these efforts, in line with the mobilization of resources made during the New Deal and WWII, but with an explicit choice to include black, indigenous and other minority communities who were systematically excluded in the past.\u201d However, he claims the investment will effectively \u201cpay for itself\u201d over 15 years and that the price of inaction will cost far more, citing experts who say that doing nothing will cost the U.S.\u00a0\u201c$34.5 trillion in economic activity\u201d by 2100. He plans to pay for the $16.3 trillion plan with additional taxes on the fossil\u00a0fuel industry, and he plans to \u201cprosecute and sue\u201d them for the damage ravaged on the planet. Sanders\u2019 exhaustive plan covers virtually every angle of the climate change \u201ccrisis,\u201d from promising to \u201cfully electrify and decarbonize\u201d the transportation sector, to investing $1.12 billion in \u201ctribal land access and extension programs,\u201d to providing \u201coral translation assistance to USDA, FDA, and DOJ offices for non-English speaking farmers,\u201d to pouring $200 billion in the Green Climate Fund: Despite the major shortcomings of the Paris Climate Agreement, one primary reason why the globe was able to come together to sign the Paris Climate Agreement was that major developed nations like the United States finally recognized that they had an outsized role in the creation of the climate crisis, and an outsized obligation to less industrialized nations to help them achieve the same kind of carbon pollution emissions reductions while improving the quality of life in those countries. In order to help countries of the global south with climate adaptation efforts, the U .S . will invest $ 200 billion in the Green Climate Fund for the equitable transfer of renewable technologies, climate adaptation, and assistance in adopting sustainable energies. U.S. leadership can ensure that the developing world secures reliable electricity, reduces poverty and pollution-related fatalities, creates greater net employment, and improves living standards all while reducing greenhouse- gas emissions. Sanders also uses his plan as a pitch to drastically expand existing entitlement programs, like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the\u00a0Low -Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). The plan states in part: Energy assistance. While we do not expect energy prices to spike because the federal government is going to weatherize homes, electrify heating, and keep electricity prices stable, we still want to ensure that families are protected during the transition. We will expand the Low -Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) by $ 25 billion to help low-income families pay their heating and cooling bills. Additionally, the program will be expanded to provide 10 percent of program costs for maintenance of new efficient heating and cooling systems and technical assistance for the installation and use of new furnaces, heat pumps, boilers, and other upgrades for the duration of the 10-year transition. Ensure a hunger- free transition. Because the cost of energy and food are so intertwined, we will provide $ 215 . 8 billion for free, universal school meals, including breakfast, lunch and snacks. We will expand the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) by $311billion to increase the benefits from the \u201d thrifty plan which provides inadequate benefits to the more generous low-cost food plan, include those with incomes up to 200 percent of the federal poverty line, remove punitive work requirements, remove barriers for college students to access SNAP , and ensure are not denied benefits due to past interaction with the criminal justice system . We will also expand the SNAP program and benefits to the people of Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa so they are on par with the benefits in the continental United States. \u201cWe need a president who has the courage, the vision, and the record to face down the greed of fossil fuel executives and the billionaire class who stand in the way of climate action,\u201d his plan states. \u201cWe need a president who welcomes their hatred. Bernie will lead our country to enact the Green New Deal and bring the world together to defeat the existential threat of climate change,\u201d it continues. The release of Sanders\u2019 plan comes on the heels of Gov. Jay Inslee\u2019s (D) departure from the presidential race. Inslee was the only candidate to build his entire campaign on the sole issue of climate change. \u201cI have seven grandchildren, and I\u2019m going to be damned if I\u2019m going to leave them a planet that is unhealthy and uninhabitable,\u201d Sanders told the New York Times.",

This type of corporate sponsorship is a corrupting influence and must end if politicians are going to represent the American people,\u201d it adds. The bulk of Sanders\u2019 proposal targets the \u201cinfluence of corporations\u201d at the Democratic National Committee. He pledges a lifetime ban on lobbying for National Party Chairs and Co-Chairs and aims to diminish their influence by banning chairs and co-chairs from working for entities: The presidential hopeful also vows to ban\u00a0donations from both corporations and lobbyists, and calls to \u201cinstitute a lifetime lobbying ban for former members of Congress and senior staffers.\u201d Another facet of Sanders\u2019 plan is to \u201cban advertising during presidential primary debates\u201d due to the \u201coutrageous sums of money\u201d media outlets charge to run ads during debates. Sanders uses CNN as an example: This year\u00a0CNN reportedly required a commitment of $300,000 before a sponsor could buy ad time during the presidential debates, and 30 seconds of air time can cost around $110,000,\u201d Private media outlets are making enormous sums of money during events that are meant to inform the public about their candidates. Furthermore, many of their advertisers have vested interest in who is elected. This type of influence must end. He also calls to end corporate influence on presidential inaugurations, arguing that it is \u201cabsolutely absurd that these entities are allowed to spend enormous sums of money in an attempt to garner favor with the President and Vice President of the United States.\u201d \u201cOur grassroots-funded campaign is proving every single day that you don\u2019t need billionaires and private fundraisers to run for president,\u201d Sanders said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019ve received more contributions from more individual contributors than any campaign in the history of American politics because we understand the basic reality that you can\u2019t take on a corrupt system if you take its money,\u201d he added. Sanders has raised more than any other Democrat presidential candidate in the third quarter, reporting $25.3 million from 1.4 million individual donations. The average donation was $18.07, according to the Sanders campaign.",

Politico reported: Dozens of state representatives, party leaders, operatives and volunteers said they weren\u2019t planning to vote for the former vice president in the nomination contest \u2014 and many publicly aired concerns about his age, energy and gender. \u2026 The complaints about Biden from party soldiers often centered on his campaigning skills, and a desire for more diversity in Democratic leadership.

That is why, Sanders said, his administration will erase $81 billion in existing medical debt across the board. Via The Hill: Sanders\u2019s plan would cancel $81 billion in existing past-due medical debt, repeal parts of the 2005 Bankruptcy reform bill and ensure that unpaid medical bills do not impact one\u2019s credit score. Sanders has hit the 2005 bill for eliminating \u201cfundamental consumer protections,\u201d accusing the bill of making it difficult for Americans to pay back medical debt by imposing stringent means tests. \u201cIt is nothing less than barbaric that the leading cause of bankruptcy in America is medical debt,\u201d Sanders echoed in a tweet. \u201cThese people didn\u2019t spend all their money on luxury items. Their crime was that they got sick. We are going to cancel all $81 billion in existing past-due medical debt,\u201d he promised.  This is not the first time Sanders has promised to erase debt across the board. He also proposed to cancel $1.6 trillion in student debt via the College For All Act, which would cost roughly $2 trillion. That is in addition to his $16 trillion Green New Deal proposal and his plans to implement Medicare for All, which could cost\u00a0 the U.S. anywhere from $32 trillion to $60 trillion over the next decade alone.",

Ocasio-Cortez\u00a0worked as a\u00a0volunteer\u00a0organizer for\u00a0Sanders\u2019s\u00a02016 campaign. The development comes after Sanders said that he \u201cmisspoke\u201d when he told reporters he may slow his frenetic campaigning pace after a recent heart attack. The Vermont senator backtracked in an interview with NBC News\u00a0just a day after\u00a0indicating that health concerns would force him to change \u201cthe nature\u201d of his campaign, in the short term, at least. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get back into the groove of a very vigorous campaign,\u201d Sanders told NBC, downplaying the impact of the heat attack, which required him to be rushed to the hospital where he received two stents to clear a clogged artery in his heart. \u201cPeople should think that I had a procedure which hundreds of thousands of people a year have,\u201d Sanders continued. \u201cPeople should think that according to the doctors I\u2019m on the way to a full recovery.\u201d The 78-year-old self-described democratic socialist was hospitalized after experiencing chest discomfort while campaigning in Las Vegas last week. His staff initially said the stents were inserted for a blocked artery, revealing only two days later that he had had a heart attack. Sanders told NBC it was \u201cnonsense\u201d to suggest his staff hadn\u2019t been forthright about his condition. He said he was still talking to doctors and trying to understand what was going on.

Both states, NBC argues, are at the \u201cheart of Democrats\u2019 geography problem.\u201d NBC News adds: Both behemoths are growing more diverse at a much faster rate than the nation \u2014 owing to booming Asian and Latino populations \u2014 and are trending toward Democrats. Yet neither blue California nor red Texas would play a pivotal role in a close 2020 election, potentially rendering millions of additional Democratic votes useless. A presidential candidate must reach 270 Electoral College votes to win. Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in 2016 with 306 Electoral College votes to Clinton\u2019s 232. Following the election results, Clinton\u2019s supporters argued for the abolishment of the Electoral College and pointed to the popular vote, which Clinton \u201cwon\u201d by nearly 2.9 million voters. Proponents of the Electoral College system, however, note that the Founding Fathers set up the Electoral College system as a safeguard against mob rule, preventing densely populated areas \u2013 particularly on the coasts \u2013 from determining the results of presidential elections. The Electoral College essentially gives communities in less populous states a fair, proportional voice in determining the direction of the country. Trump won in 2016, in part, for winning over voters in Rust Belt states, including Wisconsin, Ohio, Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. This is not the first time Sanders has voiced support for abolishing the current system. During an appearance at a town hall hosted by League of United Latin American Citizens last week, Sanders expressed support for abolishing the Electoral College. \u201cIt is hard to defend a system in which we have a president who lost the popular vote by 3 million votes, so the answer is yes,\u201d Sanders said. Other 2020 candidates, such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Beto O\u2019Rourke (D), and Pete Buttigieg (D), have expressed support for abolishing the Electoral College as well.",

The claims are based on the celebrated leaked emails and memos from the \u201cGuccifer 2.0\u201d hacks last June. The leaks appear to show direct assistance of Secretary Clinton to the detriment of Senator Sanders. The novel legal theory is based on the donors having been duped by the DNC\u2019s claims of impartiality. Attorney Jared Beck of Beck & Lee Trial Lawyers, the firm representing the class of Bernie supporters, spoke with Breitbart News about the developing case and the surrounding controversies. The entire case\u00a0shot into the public eye when, according to a notice Beck & Lee filed with the court, their office received a call asking for information about the case from a person using a voice-altering device. A quick lookup of the number revealed it was from a number associated with the congressional office of DNC Chairwoman Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz (D-FL). The DNC\u2019s attorney\u2019s quickly denied any knowledge of the incident, claim the number is from an unused office and is possibly the result of number \u201cspoofing\u201d by an outside source. Asked about the call, Beck told Breitbart News: The incident was startling at the time it happened and we are still very puzzled and concerned by it. \u00a0The caller had altered his or her voice to be unrecognizable, and refused to identify themselves.\u00a0 But please understand that this is just one \u00a0in a number of disturbing events that have occurred \u00a0throughout the case \u2026 I have no idea who was behind the call, but according to the Defendants, the matter has been referred to the Capitol Police. As for the case itself, Beck was confident that general common law principles of fraud and misrepresentation could sustain the Bernie-donors\u2019 claim. \u201cIf there is anything \u201cnew,\u201d it is the application of these principles to the sphere of political campaigns,\u201d he said. Beck went on to describe that application as follows: One might view this application as a natural consequence of Citizens United \u2013 an opinion that crystallizes campaign contributions as the quintessential form of American political participation.\u00a0 By equating political participation with financial contribution, Citizens United, by inference, incorporates all of the common-law principles of fraud, negligent misrepresentation, etc. that typically govern in the economic sphere. Americans have a cognizable interest in the transparent and fair conduct of primary campaigns precisely because they, through their campaign contributions, are also financiers of the campaign. Asked to make an analogy to a more traditional case of fraud outside the political realm, Beck compared the DNC\u2019s actions with a \u201cPonzi-scheme,\u201d in which investors buy in based on fraudulent returns that are really just earlier investors: I would think of this as a case against the ultimate political Ponzi scheme. We are used to the concept of Ponzi schemes in the investment world. In my view, the DNC is really no different: it was purporting to be \u201cselling\u201d a fair primary process but in reality was serving as a front for the Hillary Clinton campaign. People lost well over $200 million as a result. Beck told Breitbart News that there bringing the facts of the DNC\u2019s conduct to light: There are two main goals to the litigation: obtaining justice for our clients through whatever legal remedies are available; and having a trial on the issues, so that the public may know the truth of what happened with respect to the 2016 Democratic nominating process. The circumstances by which the DNC leaks came to light, allegedly by hacks by Russian government agents, has been a major public controversy for nearly a year. If the case survives the motion to dismiss, discovery will begin, potentially bringing a trove of new information to light about the DNC\u2019s internal operations and how they came to be the apparent victim of Russian hacking. Beck was optimistic about the prospects for discovery: If we do get to the discovery phase, I think it is safe to say that we expect to find much more evidence of the DNC\u2019s misconduct, with the publicly released material being only the tip of the iceberg.\u00a0 Also, we will be able to place all of the material witnesses under oath and take their depositions.\u00a0 In addition, we will be able to conduct discovery on the question of how the DNC\u2019s internal documents came to be placed into the public domain by Guccifer 2.0 and WikiLeaks, which may ultimately be the most important question of all. It is unclear when the court will rule on the motion to dismiss but Judge\u00a0William Zloch told the parties in April it would \u201ctake some time.\u201d",

Despite all of that, he will be a very formidable opponent,\u201d Sanders proclaimed. \u201cWe can beat him and we will beat him. But we cannot take anything for granted,\u201d he continued, stressing the importance of voter turnout. \u201cTo win, we have got to create the largest voter turnout in the history of the country,\u201d he added:  Sanders\u2019 call for the \u201clargest voter turnout in the history of the country\u201d follows the emergence of three election models used by Moody\u2019s Analytics, two of which show the president winning by greater margins than 2016. As Breitbart News reported: \u201cUnder the average of the three models, Trump would hold on to key industrial Midwest states and pick up New Hampshire, Virginia and Minnesota,\u201d Moody\u2019s\u00a0said\u00a0in a report detailing the results of its models. Moody\u2019s election forecasts have been very reliable in the past, correctly predicting every election result except 2016. The model undercounted support for Trump because it did not anticipate the increase in voter turnout that shifted the majority vote in crucial states. Importantly, Moody\u2019s models all predict Trump wins even if the economy dips to multiyear lows by the end of 2020 and the stock market crashes 9 percent. In other words, Trump is expected to win despite a falling stock market and a sagging economy. Nonetheless, voter turnout could also play a huge role in the election results. As Breitbart News detailed: If turnout by Democrats and independents voting against Trump is low to average, Trump easily wins under the models. If it climbs to the historical maximum, Trump would lose under the stock market and unemployment models but still win in the pocketbook model.\u201d Sanders will appear at a highly anticipated \u201cBernie\u2019s Back Rally\u201d in New York Saturday afternoon alongside Rep.

            "subtitle": "Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush is praising President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s choice of Betsy DeVos\u00a0to run the Department of Education.",
            "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
            "content": " Bush described DeVos, who is a major contributor to the Republican Party, as an \u201coutstanding pick\u201d for the cabinet position, reports The Hill. Bush said he looked forward to DeVos\u2019 \u201cbold leadership.\u201d \u201cI cannot think of a more effective and passionate change agent to press for a new education vision, one in which students, rather than adults and bureaucracies, become the priority in our nation\u2019s classrooms,\u201d he said. DeVos, who supports school vouchers for charter schools as a means to bring about school choice, is chairwoman of the American Federation for Children (AFC), a charter school promotion group, and is also a board member of Bush\u2019s Foundation for Excellence in Education (FEE). Bush and his foundation have served as champions for the Common Core standards. Dick and Betsy DeVos are also major donors to FEE. In 2015, they donated between $50,000 and $100,000. Bush was severely criticized by Trump during the primary for the former governor\u2019s support for Common Core, which Trump described as a \u201cdisaster.\u201d Trump vowed to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education to get Washington, D.C. out of education. \u201cThe last thing we need is another Bush,\u201d Trump said in January. \u201cHe\u2019s totally in favor of Common Core \u2013 that\u2019s a disaster \u2013 it\u2019s bad. It should be local and all of that.\u201d In announcing his nominee, Trump said, \u201cBetsy DeVos is a brilliant and passionate education advocate.\u201d \u201cUnder her leadership we will reform the U.S. education system and break the bureaucracy that is holding our children back so that we can deliver world-class education and school choice to all families,\u201d he added. Trump did not mention in his announcement the two things he vowed repeatedly to parents he would work to eliminate: the federally coerced program known as Common Core, and the U.S. education department. No mention was made that DeVos shared his vision of Common Core being a \u201cdisaster\u201d and that the days of the U.S. Education Department were now numbered. Trump transition team spokesman Jason Miller, however, said in a statement, \u201cThe President-elect has been consistent and very clear in his opposition to Common Core. Anybody joining the Administration is signing on to the President-elect\u2019s platform and vision for moving America forward.\u201d Trump\u2019s transition team\u00a0said Saturday, however, the discussion between the president-elect and DeVos when they met \u201cwas focused on the Common Core mission, and setting higher national standards and promoting the growth of school choice across the nation.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s an education establishment euphemism for Common Core,\u201d writes The Federalist\u2019s Joy Pullmann at Conservative Review. \u201cNational standards are what Common Core was designed to be. Pursuing them is how we got Common Core.\u201d Pullmann continues, explaining how the use of taxpayer-funded vouchers to bring about school choice brings about more regulation into the private and charter schools that accept them: Setting \u201chigh standards\u201d is the job of parents and local communities, not the U.S. education nanny. Tying \u201chigh standards\u201d to school choice is also troubling, because this is again bureaucrat-speak for \u201crequiring all private schools to teach Common Core using the control mechanism of tests.\u201d When DeVos touts \u201cschool choice,\u201d she\u2019s pushing an education agenda that includes\u00a0requiring all the schools that take voucher money to use state-determined curriculum, like Common Core. This is how she has used her millions of dollars in the past. If she\u2019s education secretary, we have every reason to believe it\u2019s how she\u2019d use even more power. On what appears to be a new website, DeVos answers a question about whether she can \u201cprovide some straight talk\u201d on the topic of Common Core. She responds: Certainly. I am not a supporter\u2014period. I do support high standards, strong accountability, and local control. When Governors such as\u00a0John Engler, Mike Huckabee, and Mike Pence were driving the conversation on voluntary high standards driven by local voices, it all made sense. Have organizations that I have been a part of supported Common Core? Of course. But that\u2019s not my position. Sometimes it\u2019s not just students who need to do their homework. However, along the way, it got turned into a federalized boondoggle.  Gov. Mike Huckabee and now Vice President-elect Mike Pence both got into hot water with anti-Common Core activists as well. Huckabee became known for recommending that the Common Core standards simply be \u201crebranded\u201d with a different name since the reform had grown so politically \u201ctoxic.\u201d Gov. Pence apparently heeded Huckabee\u2019s advice and then drew the ire of parents in his state of Indiana when he turned around and approved a \u201crebrand\u201d of Common Core soon after achieving a repeal of the standards. It\u2019s not clear how DeVos can respond \u201ccertainly\u201d and with a definitive \u201cperiod\u201d that she does not support Common Core when she never articulated such views against it in the past, or came to the aid of parents fighting the \u201cboondoggle\u201d in her state of Michigan. Though DeVos minimizes her associations with pro-Common Core organizations, they are readily visible and most would assume if she gives considerable financial and time and talent support to a group of people, she probably believes what they believe. As a member of the board of Jeb Bush\u2019s national education foundation, DeVos was likely aware that the \u201creform agenda\u201d of the organization she has been helping to guide includes college and career readiness; digital learning; utilizing student standardized assessment to determine teacher performance ratings; outcome-based funding; and standards and accountability \u2013 which include \u201chigh academic standards with their progress measured.\u201d This agenda is nearly identical to that of the Common Core \u201creform\u201d and is what Bush\u2019s foundation has sought to thrust upon the nation. And Bush has been an ardent supporter of the Core in other ways. Another of his education groups \u2013 Chiefs for Change \u2013 a bipartisan coalition of state education chiefs \u2013 consisted of some members who were also members of the PARCC Common Core test consortium \u2013 one of the two federally funded interstate groups that developed tests aligned with the Common Core standards. A report at the Detroit News in July states that DeVos was also an at-large delegate for pro-Common Core Ohio Gov. John Kasich. Kasich \u2013 like Jeb Bush \u2013 received a grade of \u201cF\u201d at The Pulse 2016 for his support of the controversial standards. The Ohio governor referred to parent activists in his state fighting against the Core as a \u201crunaway internet campaign,\u201d just as Bush said Republicans didn\u2019t need anti-Common Core conservatives to win the White House. Buzzfeed also reported DeVos has \u201cclose ties to many on Capitol Hill\u201d and \u201cis closely aligned to Republican education officials like Sen. Lamar Alexander,\u201d an association that is not likely to endear her to grassroots parent activists. Alexander rammed through a massive \u201cbipartisan\u201d bill to replace No Child Left Behind that gives the U.S. Education Secretary significant control over standards and testing. President Barack Obama took such a liking to Alexander\u2019s legislation that he signed it immediately into law last December, praising it as a \u201cChristmas miracle.\u201d Pullmann observes about DeVos\u2019 claim she is \u201ccertainly\u201d not a Common Core supporter: That\u2019s sure news to all the grassroots folks she\u00a0pit her big money against\u00a0during their legislative battles to reject Common Core. Grassroots folks report to me that DeVos\u2019 husband personally called state senators in Michigan to get them to vote against a Common Core repeal bill. DeVos\u2019 American Federation for Children also contributed\u00a0huge sums of money\u00a0for state school board races in Alabama on the side of Common Core supporters trying to oust Common Core opponents.  Michigan parent activist Karen Braun tells Breitbart News DeVos never used any of her time or wealth to assist parents in her state in their efforts to repeal Common Core. \u201cDeVos prefers to be out of the limelight and let others like the Great Lakes Education Project (GLEP) do the heavy lifting,\u201d Braun says. \u201cBut activists and lawmakers in Michigan know her pro-Common Core position very well.\u201d She continues: I had a discussion with former Michigan State Representative Tom McMillin about the DeVos appointment.\u00a0He and I worked closely to try and get Common Core out of Michigan.\u00a0He said he had a terse conversation with her in 2013 in the heat of our efforts to repeal Common Core \u2026 she was very clear she loved Common Core and all the high-stakes testing and central planning.\u00a0Her recent statement claiming to be against it is disingenuous. She never did anything to help the efforts to get rid of Common Core and did many things behind the scenes to hinder us.\u00a0We have a repeal and replace bill in Michigan that GLEP opposes and have worked over lawmakers to make sure it doesn\u2019t pass.\u00a0We\u2019ve done our homework and we know that DeVos is pro-Common Core despite any statement she puts out today. Shane Vander Hart at Truth in American Education confirms, \u201cFormer Michigan State Representative Tom McMillin said to me, \u2018[DeVos] and GLEP were one of the main leaders defending Common Core when I was fighting it in the legislature. In 2013 I know she was strongly supportive of Common Core and high stakes testing.\u201d Perhaps parent activists can take heart that DeVos has suddenly turned over a new leaf and is now against Common Core and the federal control of education it represents since her new boss says he is committed to its demise. In that case, talk of \u201cnationalized high standards\u201d will need to disappear, and instead take a turn toward Trump\u2019s plan to finally dismantle the U.S. Department of Education and return education policy to the states and local school districts where the Constitution says it belongs.

            "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
            "content": " DeVos met with leaders from the Home School Legal Defense Association\u00a0(HSLDA) Monday, who conveyed to the secretary their concerns about regulation of homeschooling tied to school vouchers and discrimination against homeschoolers by higher education programs that refuse to accept homeschool diplomas. HSLDA president Mike Smith, vice presidents Jim Mason and Chuck Hurst, and director of federal relations William Estrada met with DeVos, along with Tricia Powell, a homeschooling parent. Estrada posted on Facebook Tuesday about the meeting: We discussed the successes of homeschooling, the work that HSLDA is doing to support homeschoolers and state and local homeschool support groups, and how homeschoolers just want to be left alone by the federal government (homeschoolers don\u2019t want to be included in any federal k-12 voucher programs due to the threat of government regulations down the road.) We discussed how homeschool graduates still face discrimination, usually in the form of federally funded higher education programs that refuse to accept their homeschool high school diploma. Estrada noted the homeschooling leaders also \u201cdiscussed how the Common Core and other federal overreach in public education has driven more families to choose homeschooling.\u201d \u201cSecretary DeVos strongly agreed with us that the federal government does not have the authority to dictate curriculum decisions to states and local schools,\u201d he said. Estrada observed, nevertheless, the seeming paradox between his praise of DeVos as a \u201ctrue friend and ally\u201d to homeschoolers and his own view that there is no place for the federal government in education issues. He wrote: Some may find this post to be interesting as my personal position is well known that I believe the federal department of education is nowhere found in the Constitution, and should be closed, and all education decisions returned to the states and local school boards. That hasn\u2019t changed. However, Congress created the federal Department of Education lawfully, and only Congress can close it down. And until that happens, I want someone as Secretary of Education who understands the limited federal role in education, and who respects family freedom in education. And Betsy DeVos does. In February, Iowa Rep. Steve King created a firestorm when he introduced H.R. 610, the Choices in Education Act of 2017, a bill that Estrada asserted \u201cwould be a slippery slope toward more federal involvement and control in homeschooling.\u201d Estrada explained the bill would essentially create a \u201cfederal right to homeschool\u201d: While this sounds good, HSLDA has fought \u2014 successfully\u2014for decades to make sure that there is no \u201cfederal right to homeschool\u201d because what could be created by a favorable Congress could be regulated by a future, hostile Congress. It is far better (and far more constitutionally sound) for education decisions\u2014and homeschool freedom\u2014to be protected at the state level. We ask our friends at the federal level to simply leave homeschooling families alone. After a fierce backlash from homeschoolers throughout the country, Estrada wrote last month that the Choices in Education Act \u201cis dead for all practical purposes.\u201d \u201cThe high level of attention this bill received from\u00a0homeschoolers across the country\u00a0proved how strong opposition to federal money is in the homeschooling community,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has served as a \u2018shot across the bow\u2019 of our friends (and opponents) in Washington, D.C., reminding them that homeschoolers do not want education vouchers from the federal government.",

            "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
            "content": " Within days of Donald Trump\u2019s election victory, Betsy DeVos\u2019s good friend Jeb Bush asked her if she would be interested in the top federal education post, and then asked Vice President-elect Mike Pence to recommend her for the job, the report says. \u201cHe was really the only person I knew in the transition,\u201d Bush told Tim Alberta, writing for Politico Magazine. \u201cHe was the best person, because he was running it.\u201d Bush added it turned out both he and Pence \u2013 two former GOP governors \u2013 had the same thought since both had worked with DeVos to advance their education agendas in their home states of Florida and Indiana, respectively. \u201cHe made it clear that he was already thinking about Betsy, too,\u201d Bush said of Pence. Once DeVos was formally nominated by Trump, Bush announced publicly he was \u201cexcited.\u201d DeVos has been widely criticized by the conservative base of the Republican Party \u2013 a fact often left out when the focus is simply on condemnation of her school choice policies by teachers\u2019 unions. Though once nominated by Trump, DeVos announced she was \u201ccertainly \u2026 not a supporter\u201d of Common Core, she made\u00a0contributions\u00a0of both her time and personal wealth to support pro-Common Core organizations that fought repeal of the controversial standards, including the Great Lakes Education Project in her home state of Michigan and Bush\u2019s Foundation for Excellence in Education. As Indiana governor, Pence signed a bill repealing Common Core in his state but then drew the ire of anti-Common Core parent groups when he approved a \u201crebrand\u201d of the unpopular reform \u2013 basically Common Core with a few tweaks. In addition to supporting Bush and his foundation, DeVos ultimately became an at-large delegate at the Republican National Convention last year for Ohio Gov. John Kasich, another supporter of Common Core. DeVos has since angered conservative parents further by her statements that because of the new massive federal education law known as the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) \u201cthere isn\u2019t any Common Core anymore\u201d in the country\u2019s schools. Most states, however, have continued to use the controversial standards, including those that have changed the name or \u201crebranded\u201d them. Jane Robbins, senior fellow at American Principles Project, observes at Truth in American Education, that Bush has given DeVos every reason to be proud: DeVos \u2026 populated USED with bureaucrats from the Bush wing of education policy, including Democrat and Black Lives Matter supporter Jason Botel (since departed, after angering DeVos\u2019s Michigan friends over that state\u2019s ESSA plan). Conservative activists were disappointed and mystified by these choices, especially since there\u2019s no shortage of solid, highly qualified Common Core opponents who were available. Despite the support of Bush and Pence, DeVos\u2019s Senate confirmation was far from smooth sailing, and ultimately required Pence as vice president to break a tie vote. According to Alberta, DeVos says she was taken aback by the intensity of the confirmation process: Teachers unions remain the most organized cell of the Democratic coalition, but much of the outcry over her performance was organic and owed to self-inflicted wounds: showing no understanding of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act; fumbling straightforward questions about accountability, proficiency and growth; citing grizzly bears in Wyoming as the reason some schools should be free to keep guns on premises. \u201cI think I was undercoached,\u201d DeVos said, referring to the Trump transition team as the source of her difficulties with the Senate. She reportedly added: The transition group was very circumspect about how much information they gave me about then-current policy and \u2026 it was in their view a balance between being prepared for a confirmation hearing and not having well-formed opinions on what should or shouldn\u2019t change, so as not to get caught in a confirmation hearing making commitments that then I wouldn\u2019t want to or be able to keep. And in hindsight, I wish I had a whole lot more information. DeVos further expressed \u201cirritation,\u201d as Alberta notes, about being banned by the transition team from doing interviews. \u201cDuring the confirmation process, I wasn\u2019t able to talk with the media at all. I wasn\u2019t able to express anything from my perspective,\u201d she says. \u201cSo it gave weeks and weeks of open shots for my opponents to take.\u201d While discussing various education policy changes since DeVos has assumed her post, Alberta observes the secretary has been blamed by some for the Trump administration\u2019s reversal of former President Barack Obama\u2019s public school transgender bathroom policy: But that decision was made by Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2014who had jurisdiction on the matter\u2014and one, according to people close to DeVos, she vehemently disagreed with. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel the timing was appropriate,\u201d she tells me, measuring her words, in her first public break with the administration. Immediately following a New York Times report in February suggesting that DeVos was at odds with Trump and Sessions over changing the transgender bathroom policy, DeVos released a statement that her department was \u201ccommitted\u201d to protecting LGBT students. \u201cI have dedicated my career to advocating for and fighting on behalf of students, and as Secretary of Education, I consider protecting all students, including LGBTQ students, not only a key priority for the Department, but for every school in America,\u201d DeVos said. According to the report, DeVos may be disappointed that her budget request for school choice funding was not honored by Congress, but says, \u201c\u201cWell, let\u2019s keep in mind that this is only the first budget cycle. There are other budget cycles.\u201d",

            "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
            "content": " The Washington Examiner\u2019s Jason Russell reports GOP megadonor DeVos endorsed Rubio in the primary and that her family \u2013 heirs of the Amway fortune \u2013 backed Mitt Romney in 2012. Russell adds the DeVos family\u2019s financial support \u201cmay have been crucial for [Romney] as he squeaked past Rick Santorum by three points to notch a crucial win before Super Tuesday.\u201d During an interview in March, DeVos told Russell, \u201cI don\u2019t think Donald Trump represents the Republican Party.\u201d She continued with comments on the GOP primary race: We as a family decided to, as many did, see how things unfolded nationally. There were a number of candidates that we felt would be very capable, that we could easily embrace and support. As the field has continued to narrow, after Gov. [Jeb] Bush exited the race, we felt it appropriate and an important time to lend our voice, whatever impact that might have, particularly with Michigan\u2019s primary coming up. That was our impetus to embrace and publicly support Sen. Rubio. Describing Trump as \u201can interloper\u201d who is \u201cnot winning the support of traditional Republicans,\u201d DeVos said: I continue to be very optimistic that as we get further along into the process, the more voters know about him, and the more informed they are, the more they\u2019re going to continue to break away. That\u2019s even held true in the primaries held to date. I think he has underperformed compared to public polls just days before the Super Tuesday contests. I think more and more people are going to realize that they really don\u2019t trust him. The more they learn about his record, they\u2019re going to break away and go to an alternate. I continue to think that Rubio is a very strong and viable candidate that will represent our party and the future for our country very, very well. Asked about whether she would support Trump if he eventually won the GOP nomination, DeVos responded: I\u2019m still confident that he is not going to be the nominee. We have a long way to go. As you noted, he has a quarter of the necessary delegates, but that\u2019s a long way from 100 percent of the delegates needed. As we start to get into winner-take-all primaries, Florida is going to be a strong place for Marco Rubio. I think the dynamics will continue to evolve and change. The more people understand the totality of Donald Trump and what he stands for, I am confident and convinced they are going to look to an alternative to support. Several months later, during the Republican National Convention \u2013 where DeVos was an at-large delegate for Ohio Gov. John Kasich \u2013 Russell wrote the proponent of charter schools and school choice was waiting to hear Trump talk about school choice before she would back him. Up until that point, Trump\u2019s talk about education had been fairly limited to pronouncing Common Core a \u201cdisaster\u201d and recommending that Washington, D.C. get out of education, leaving it to the states instead. \u201cI\u2019ve been happily surprised to hear [school choice] mentioned as many times as it has been, because it hasn\u2019t been part of the conversation nationally to date,\u201d DeVos said, according to Russell. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty understandable because on the other side, Hillary is clearly in the camp of the status quo and the teachers\u2019 unions. But I\u2019m very hopeful Mr. Trump will begin talking about this as part of his campaign rhetoric going into the fall.\u201d DeVos added that she would be \u201ccontinuing to watch and listen and observe\u201d whether Trump began to speak of school choice. Her decision to support him, however, would require \u201ca greater focus on the issues that are of import to all of the American people. \u2026 I need to see more of a refinement on that. And to see a more presidential demeanor.\u201d According to Russell, the billionaire added that Trump\u2019s rhetoric also would need to be refined. Author Jane Mayer reports that, in a column at Roll Call in 1997, DeVos wrote about the power of \u201csoft money\u201d and its influence on politicians. DeVos said: I know something about soft money, as my family is the largest single contributor of soft money to the national Republican Party.\u00a0I have decided, however, to stop taking offense at the suggestion that we are buying influence. Now I simply concede the point. They are right. We do expect some things in return. Trump officially won DeVos\u2019 state of Michigan last\u00a0week, the first Republican to do so since George H.W. Bush in 1988.",

            "subtitle": "President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s education secretary nominee Betsy DeVos has contributed both her wealth and influence to the creation of more charter schools in her home state of Michigan, but national test scores show the state has not fared well as a result, says a report in Politico.",
            "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
            "content": " The report, published Friday, says, \u201cDespite two decades of charter-school growth, the state\u2019s overall academic progress has failed to keep pace with other states.\u201d It continues: Michigan ranks near the bottom for fourth- and eighth-grade math and fourth-grade reading on a nationally representative test, nicknamed the \u201cNation\u2019s Report Card.\u201d Notably, the state\u2019s charter schools scored worse on that test than their traditional public-school counterparts, according to an analysis of federal data. MI NAEP by Breitbart News on Scribd  From 2009 to 2015, for example, Michigan\u2019s state average score on the NAEP mathematics assessment was below the national public school average, and from 2003 to 2007, the state\u2019s average score was \u201cnot significantly different from the national public school average.\u201d Michigan fared better in math on the Nation\u2019s Report Card from 1996 to 2000. DeVos\u2019 supporters, however, point to research from Stanford University\u2019s CREDO, which scrutinizes education reform and student performance: Compared to the educational gains that charter students would have had in a traditional public school (TPS), the analysis shows that, on average, students in Michigan charter schools make larger learning gains in both reading and mathematics. Thirty-five percent of the charter schools have significantly more positive learning gains than their TPS counterparts in reading, while two percent of charter schools have significantly lower learning gains. In math, forty-two percent of the charter schools studied outperform their TPS peers and six percent perform worse. These findings position Michigan among the highest performing charter school states CREDO has studied to date. Charter students in the city of Detroit (27% of the state\u2019s charter students), are performing even better than their peers in the rest of the state, on average gaining nearly three months achievement for each year they attend charter schools. Despite the \u201cthree months achievement\u201d progress in Michigan, it is noteworthy to look at CREDO\u2019s assessment of charter schools in Massachusetts, which rate the highest in the nation: Compared to the educational gains that charter students would have had in a traditional public school (TPS), the analysis shows on average that students in Massachusetts charter schools make larger learning gains in both reading and mathematics. At the school level, 44 percent of the charter schools have significantly more positive learning gains than their TPS counterparts in reading, while 13 percent of charter schools have significantly lower learning gains. In math, 56 percent of the charter schools studied outperform their TPS peers and 17 percent perform worse. The impact of charter schools in Boston are also analyzed separately. Compared to the educational gains that charter students would have had in TPS, the analysis shows on average that students in Boston charter schools have significantly larger learning gains in both reading and mathematics. In fact, the average growth rate of Boston charter students in math and reading is the largest CREDO has seen in any city or state thus far. At the school level, 83 percent of the charter schools have significantly more positive learning gains than their TPS counterparts in reading and math, while no Boston charter schools have significantly lower learning gains. What we can learn from this is that there are good charter schools and bad charter schools, just as there are good public schools and bad ones. States should be able\u00a0to make a difference in the quality of their schools. The Politico report then moves to the issue of school vouchers, which is a totally different issue. School vouchers are the transfer of taxpayer funds from a public school to a private or religious school. Most on the left who oppose DeVos \u2013 particularly teachers\u2019 unions \u2013 do so for several reasons, not the least of which is the claim that vouchers will suck taxpayer funds from traditional public schools and destroy them. Some on the other side say public schools are already destroyed, despite billions of taxpayer dollars poured into them over the past several decades in the name of \u201ceducation reform\u201d and \u201cclosing the achievement gap.\u201d Additionally, however, the left takes significant issue with public money going to religious schools. Grassroots constitutionalists, who have been fighting against establishment Republicans and Democrats over federal intrusion into education through Common Core, know that school vouchers, as a means to bring about \u201cschool choice,\u201d are associated with the greatest amount of regulation for the private and religious schools that agree to accept them. In some states with hefty voucher systems, private and religious schools that accept vouchers have been forced to use the same Common Core standards and have their students take the same Common Core-aligned tests as their counterparts in the public schools. This is done in the name of \u201caccountability\u201d for use of public money. This situation, however, begs the question, \u201cWhy bother, then, to move a child from a public school to a private school?\u201d Neal McCluskey, education director at Cato Institute, says his concern about DeVos is that she will attempt to direct \u201cschool choice\u201d from Washington, D.C. At a time when most grassroots parents groups across the country had hoped to find a Trump administration finally getting rid of the U.S. Department of Education, DeVos could still be running the show from D.C. \u2013 though from a different angle. \u201cEven though choice is great, it is not something people should want Washington providing,\u201d McCluskey, said in an interview with Caffeinated Thoughts. He added: Nor\u2014outside of the DC voucher program, military families, and maybe Native American reservations\u2014is it something that the feds can constitutionally provide. My fear is that DeVos and Trump might not recognize the myriad problems with taking private school choice national. More concerning, the American Federation for Children, which DeVos chairs, has tended to favor more rules and regulations on choice than I would prefer. That could become a much bigger concern were rules and regs attached to national-level vouchers. Writing at the American Spectator, Robert Holland of the Heartland Institute echoes that same concern: Although the Constitution empowers the judiciary to determine the constitutionality of laws, it does not provide for Congress, the White House, or federal agencies to control education by statute or regulation. Under the Tenth Amendment, sway over education is left to the states and to the people. The strongest step the Trump Administration could take on behalf of real choice in education would be to devise a plan for dismantling or phasing out the U.S. Education Department (USED), which came into being in 1980 as President Jimmy Carter\u2019s payoff to the largest teacher union, the National Education Association, for supporting his election campaign. USED has done nothing but impede educational progress with senseless No Child Left Behind edicts and costly Race to the Top boondoggles. Finally, Oklahoma parent activist Jenni White writes about DeVos\u2019 nomination that school vouchers are only part of the problem. \u201cPart of the reason we fought so hard against Common Core was the seepage of its tentacles into every nook and cranny of the education world \u2013 including source materials,\u201d she says. \u201cThere is no such thing as \u201cschool choice\u201d \u2013including those using traditional education methods such as homeschool \u2013 when federal policy is allowed to dictate state education function.\u201d",

            "content": "  \u201cThis agreement will build upon ongoing collaboration between the United States and Switzerland to encourage businesses and stakeholders to promote the value of apprenticeship programs and develop effective strategies to increase awareness of and access to work-based learning,\u201d the Education Department\u00a0wrote\u00a0at its website blog. The agreement comes after DeVos\u2019s announcement earlier this year about her desire to merge\u00a0the U.S. Departments of Education and Labor. After a subsequent European tour, DeVos wrote\u00a0in an op-ed at\u00a0Education Week\u00a0that during her international tour, she found the centralized approach to education and workforce development in European countries similar to what she envisioned with a merger of the U.S. Departments of Education and Labor. \u201cSwitzerland is known for its robust apprenticeship program, with more than two-thirds of high school students engaged in one of the roughly 300\u00a0government-recognized apprenticeships,\u201d DeVos wrote:  DeVos, Labor secretary Alexander Acosta, Commerce secretary Wilbur Ross, and Ivanka Trump, the president\u2019s daughter and adviser,\u00a0represented the United States at the \u201csigning ceremony\u201d with Swiss officials. \u201cThe Swiss approach is one from which we can all learn a great deal,\u201d DeVos said\u00a0in remarks at the signing event, reports Education Week. \u201cOne important take-away\u00a0from my visit to Switzerland is that Swiss business leaders\u00a0didn\u2019t ask for a\u00a0permission slip from government to partner with educators.\u201d Since her tour of European countries earlier this year, DeVos has expressed\u00a0admiration for the type of education and workforce development practices countries such as Switzerland, the Netherlands, and the U.K embrace. In June, DeVos said it was her hope that adopting some of the education policies of these nations would \u201chelp catch us up\u201d to students from other countries:  In its blog post, the Education Department lists 15 facts about the Swiss Apprenticeship Program, including that \u201cnearly 2/3 of young people in Switzerland choose to pursue a vocational program.\u201d \u201cA defining feature of the Swiss vocational education system is its close correlation with the labor market,\u201d the department continues. \u201cTraining is geared to actual demand for vocational qualifications and to available jobs.\u201d The department writes that Swiss companies spend nearly one percent of GDP annually on apprenticeships and that 50 to 80 percent of apprentices are retained in the reported companies. \u201cCompanies start recruiting students in the 7thgrade with apprenticeships starting in 10the grade,\u201d the blog post states. \u201cEven at a cost of $50K-$150K over 3-4 years, the businesses get a full return on their investment\u201d:  Some education policy analysts, however, assert federal promotion of a workforce development model of education encourages a view of children as prospective laborers who can fulfill the needs of big business for inexpensive, local workers. While some students may opt for apprenticeships on their own, these analysts are concerned about students being pigeon-holed in middle school for a particular industry favored by the government when they might develop other interests later in their education. \u201cIt\u2019s troubling that so many education policy-makers, including Secretary DeVos, are drawn to the European system of the school-to-work pipeline,\u201d Jane Robbins, senior fellow at American Principles Project, told Breitbart News. \u201cRevamping our entire system to create cogs for politically connected companies isn\u2019t the way to \u2018catch up.\u2019\u201d Similarly, Eunie Smith, president of the Eagle Forum, told Breitbart News she was concerned the type of education a child receives \u201cwould be influenced by crony corporations dictating to schools the skills needed for future workers.\u201d \u201cCentralized, government-planned economies do not work, and that\u2019s not the free market system under which America and our economy have prospered,\u201d Smith explained.",

            "content": "  \u201cParents deserve to know what is happening in their child\u2019s school,\u201d DeVos said in a statement announcing the new guide. She added: They should not have to parse through a 500-page legal document to understand how a law or policy affects their children\u2019s education. This guide demonstrates our ongoing commitment to providing parents with user-friendly tools and the information necessary to make informed decisions. Informed parents become empowered and engaged parents\u00a0who are able to better advocate on behalf of their children. Ironically, the federal \u201cguide\u201d is titled \u201cA Parent Guide to State and Local Report Cards.\u201d DeVos is advertising the guide as a means to achieve \u201ctransparency\u201d about the accountability requirements of the federal law known as the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA). In the guide, the education department explains that ESSA requires student report cards to display information about how much money from federal, state, and local sources is spent per student for each school. The law also mandates that report cards provide results of annual statewide tests in reading, English language arts, math, and science, and results of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). According to the department, ESSA states report cards must also provide parents with information about school disciplinary measures such as number of suspensions, expulsions, arrests, and incidents of violence in schools. Additionally, the federal education law requires all parents to receive information about English-language learners, children with disabilities, and foster and homeless children in their schools on their children\u2019s report cards. DeVos has touted ESSA as the means to bring about more state flexibility in control of education, though state education plans must still be approved by the federal government. The secretary has also said on several occasions that ESSA has done away with the Common Core standards, though some 42 states are still\u00a0using\u00a0the Common Core standards or its \u201crebrands.\u201d In a recent article at the Federalist, Utah parent organizer Autumn Foster Cook wrote\u00a0about ESSA: Contrary to lawmakers\u2019 promises, ESSA did not free states to pursue independent educational goals, nor reduce reliance on testing. DeVos\u2019s administration seems inclined to enforce the constraints as rigidly as possible, with little deference to state law and parental rights, despite precisely opposite rhetoric from DeVos, the Trump administration, and Republican congressional leadership that rushed ESSA into passage shortly before Barack Obama left office. Shane Vander Hart also\u00a0wrote\u00a0at Truth in American Education that ESSA essentially\u00a0cemented\u00a0Common Core \u2013 and its standardized tests \u2013 into every state in the country. \u201cSure, the U.S. Department of Education is not actively pushing Common Core, they don\u2019t need to,\u201d Vander Hart explained. \u201cThe standards and assessment consortiums don\u2019t need to be funded anymore. The damage is done. They don\u2019t need to publicly push it because ESSA essentially codified Common Core.\u201d  The education department is hosting a \u201cdesign challenge\u201d contest for the new report cards.",

            "content": " \u201cI\u2019m so excited,\u201d Bush said last week at the National Summit on Education Reform, sponsored by the\u00a0Foundation for Excellence in Education, which Bush founded and chairs and on which DeVos serves as a board member. \u201cPresident-elect Trump made an extraordinary choice with Betsy DeVos,\u201d he added, reports the SunSentinel. In his address at the summit, Bush, a strong proponent of Common Core and school vouchers, discussed the importance of taking a moral stand on school choice. The former GOP candidate did the same for amnesty for illegal immigrants when he described crossing the U.S. border illegally as an \u201cact of love.\u201d \u201cPolitically, the challenge in this really kind of crude environment is to go beyond being against what\u2019s not working and being for things that will work, that will lift people up,\u201d Bush said. \u201cAnd I tried that and totally failed, miserably. I mean, like, belly flop \u2014 bam.\u201d Upon DeVos\u2019 nomination, Bush said, \u201cI cannot think of a more effective and passionate change agent to press for a new education vision, one in which students, rather than adults and bureaucracies, become the priority in our nation\u2019s classrooms.\u201d At Townhall, American Principles Project senior fellow Jane Robbins writes that Trump\u2019s choice of DeVos to run the federal education department could even be viewed as \u201cJeb\u2019s revenge.\u201d Robbins continues: Jeb Bush and his ideological compatriots, including DeVos, advance what could be called a \u201cgovernment-foundation cartel\u201d model of educational policy-making. Private foundations funded by wealthy individuals (who themselves may be dilettantes with no real experience in education) contribute ideas, and frequently personnel, to the government to achieve their policy goals. The government relies on \u201cresearch\u201d funded by these foundations to support the preferred policies, and if Congress or state legislatures are involved, their members are assured these ideas are terrific because of all this research. Even the new \u201cbipartisan\u201d education law \u2013 the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) \u2013 pushed through Congress by Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-TN), will provide DeVos, if confirmed, with continued power to manage the nation\u2019s schools and students. Robbins notes ESSA \u201censhrines the progressive-education agenda of national standards, workforce development, competency-based education (the modern term for discredited outcome-based education), digital training, government preschool, and non-academic \u2018social emotional learning.\u2019\u201d Though, upon her nomination, DeVos quickly dismissed any notion that she has been supportive of Common Core, her statement that she calls for \u201chigh standards\u201d and \u201caccountability\u201d are \u201csleight of hand\u201d words that describe the unpopular nationalized standards, says Robbins. Grassroots Common Core opponents in DeVos\u2019 home state of Michigan also noted\u00a0the philanthropist had never contacted them to ask how she might assist them in their efforts to repeal Common Core in their state. Trump vowed to eliminate Common Core while on the campaign trail, referring to it as a \u201cdisaster.\u201d He also said he would work to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education. Trump transition team spokesman Jason Miller said in a statement following the announcement of DeVos\u2019 nomination, \u201cThe President-elect has been consistent and very clear in his opposition to Common Core. Anybody joining the Administration is signing on to the President-elect\u2019s platform and vision for moving America forward.\u201d",

            "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
            "content": " DeVos\u2019 nomination moved to the full Senate after the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee voted 12-11 along party lines to confirm her. Two liberal Republican senators, Susan Collins (R-ME) and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), however, said they could not support her and would vote only to advance her nomination to the floor of the Senate. \u201cI will not, I cannot vote to confirm her as our nation\u2019s next secretary of education,\u201d Collins said. \u201cI was trying to get to yes,\u201d said Murkowski. \u201cI couldn\u2019t.\u201d As Roll Call reports, since the GOP has a 52-48 advantage in the Senate, Vice President Mike Pence would likely break a tie if only Collins and Murkowski vote against DeVos. However, if Sessions is confirmed by the Senate next, the GOP would be left with one less senator, leaving DeVos with a failing vote of 49-50. According to the report, Senate leadership has scheduled the DeVos nomination to precede that of Sessions since she might need his vote in order to pave the way for Pence to break a tie. White House press secretary Sean Spicer, however, said he is still encouraged, says the New York Times. \u201cI am 100 percent confident she will be the next secretary of education,\u201d he said. DeVos has been one of the most controversial picks of President Donald Trump. Democrats \u2013 largely ignoring national test scores showing the continued downturn of performance by the nation\u2019s public school students \u2013 have portrayed DeVos as unqualified to run a department that oversees the nation\u2019s public schools, since she has largely been an advocate for charter schools and school vouchers. Democrat senators also spent considerable time during committee debate discussing concerns that DeVos would not continue President Barack Obama\u2019s expansion of the department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights. Teachers\u2019 unions have strongly opposed DeVos\u2019 nomination. \u201cIf confirmed, DeVos would become the first secretary of education with zero experience with public schools,\u201d National Education Association (NEA) president Lily Eskelsen Garcia said. \u201cShe\u2019s never worked in a public school. She\u2019s never been a teacher, a school administrator, nor served on any public board of education.\u201d Republicans, however, portray DeVos as a generous devotee of school choice and of giving parents the opportunity to remove their children from failing public schools through voucher systems. Senators such as Tim Scott (R-SC) say DeVos\u2019 skills in developing school choice programs would offer low-income, disadvantaged students an opportunity to get out of failing public schools that leave them without the opportunity to advance into higher education and meaningful careers. Anti-Common Core grassroots groups, however \u2013 largely the base of the GOP \u2013 have been critical of DeVos\u2019 nomination because she has financed and served on the boards of many organizations that promote Common Core. Additionally, one of DeVos\u2019 main supporters is Jeb Bush, a prominent promoter of Common Core. Among the U.S. Department of Education staffers who have already been sworn in are supporters of Common Core and individuals with\u00a0connections to both Bush and Bill Gates, the Microsoft founder who served as the primary source of private funding for Common Core. Dr. Karen Effrem, a Florida-based education activist and president of Education Liberty Watch, tells Breitbart News the staffers already on board in the Trump administration\u2019s education department are a concern. \u201cThis list of Bush, Clinton, and Obama cronies is just another kick in the gut to parents who voted for Donald Trump in droves in the great hope that he would do as he promised,\u201d she says. \u201cInstead of a smaller Department of Education, fewer Common Core and testing mandates, and protection of student privacy,\u201d she states, \u201cwe will have more regulated private and home schools with their autonomy sacrificed to Common Core on the altar of \u2018choice,\u2019 data collected on our children without consent, expanded preschool, and the continued wasteful ineffectiveness and harm of the U.S. Education Department.\u201d",

            "content": " \u201cThe rumors are just that \u2026 rumors,\u201d DeVos\u2019s press secretary Elizabeth Hill reportedly said in an email statement, reports\u00a0USA Today. \u201cThe Secretary has no plans of stepping down.\u201d DeVos has critics on both the left and the right, but Democrats who will soon control the House say they plan to call the secretary before key committees for questioning. Democrats have long supported a strong federal education department that heavily funds public schools, holds them accountable to carry out the Party\u2019s social justice agenda, and keeps the teacher union base content. In a recent interview with the New American, Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie (R) noted, \u201cThe left understands that this is where you win or lose \u2013 in the schools and in the teaching of the children.\u201d While DeVos has changed the focus of the department to school choice, she has not, however, fulfilled what the conservative/libertarian base of the Republican Party had viewed as Donald Trump\u2019s plan to gradually dismantle the department. The Constitution does not give the federal government authority to decide education policy. Additionally, DeVos has hired\u00a0many education staffers with ties to her longstanding colleague, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who lost in the 2016 GOP primary race, in part, because of his advocacy for the Common Core standards. The secretary also recently appointed\u00a0former Democrat Gov. Beverly Perdue of North Carolina, to head the National Assessment Governing Board. Like Bush, Perdue is a longtime champion of Common Core. Among the issues Politico reported\u00a0House Democrats will aggressively address with DeVos is the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cmoves to stop state-led scrutiny of federal student loan servicers.\u201d The report observed that Rep. Rosa DeLauro, a Democrat from Connecticut, \u201cis expected to lead the House Appropriations subcommittee overseeing education funding.\u201d DeLauro had \u201cclashed with Education Secretary Betsy DeVos over the issue earlier this year,\u201d noted Politico. Teachers\u2019 unions are eager to have their newly elevated Democrat representatives interrogate DeVos. The National Education Association (NEA) said in a statement after the midterm elections that Democrats are now \u201cpositioned to shift the balance of power in state capitals and the U.S. Congress, where victories will add a critical check on policies that have hurt students, their families and communities.\u201d \u201cLawmakers learned an important lesson \u2026 You can either work with educators to address the needs of students and public education, or they will work to elect someone who will,\u201d said NEA president Lily Eskelsen Garc\u00eda. \u201cCandidates across the country witnessed unprecedented activism by educators in their races. Standing up for students and supporting public education were deciding factors for voters, and educators will hold lawmakers to their promises.\u201d Education Week\u00a0also noted\u00a0that, with Virginia Rep. Bobby Scott now about to take the helm of the House education committee, \u201cincreased oversight of U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos\u201d is a given. ",

            "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
            "content": " Anti-Common Core grassroots groups of parents and teachers urged Trump to abandon DeVos as his choice, citing her support for the education reform policies of pro-Common Core Jeb Bush and her influence through the Great Lakes Education Project (GLEP) in favor of Common Core. Karen Braun who writes at\u00a0Stop Common Core in Michigan noted: GLEP is a strong supporter of the Common Core and its continued implementation in Michigan. They are part of the\u00a0Michigan Coalition for High Student Standards\u00a0which opposes SB 826 to Repeal and Replace Common Core, science, social studies, and aligned assessments with pre-common core Massachusetts standards.\u00a0Stop Common Core in Michigan believes there is a high correlation between candidates who accept the GLEP endorsement and their future votes on legislation. GLEP claims NOT to have a litmus test on Common Core.\u00a0This allows candidates to say they are against common core and still gain the endorsement of GLEP.\u00a0\u00a0But DeVos\u00a0is a champion for \u201cschool choice\u201d while at the same time continuing the implementation of common national standards.\u00a0The DeVos definition of \u201cschool choice\u201d is the freedom to choose which common core school will track your child from cradle-to-career (P20).\u00a0All Michigan charters must use common national standards. That\u2019s NOT true choice. Like Bill Gates, Betsy DeVos has some money and has some things she\u2019d like to see different.\u00a0Like all good investors, DeVos likely expects a return on her investment. And if you don\u2019t play the game under their rules and vote the way you want her to vote, you may find yourself challenged the next time you run for office. DeVos, whose family founded Amway, was\u00a0an at-large delegate for pro-Common Core Ohio Gov. John Kasich. Kasich received a\u00a0grade\u00a0of \u201cF\u201d at The Pulse 2016 for his support of the controversial standards. The former presidential candidate referred to parent activists in his state fighting against the Core as a \u201crunaway internet campaign.\u201d Trump likely chose DeVos because of her support for public/private partnership charter schools. While on the campaign trail, Trump said Common Core was a \u201cdisaster,\u201d and criticized Jeb Bush for his support for the standards. Trump also said he would get Washington, D.C. out of education, and said he favored local control of education and the dismantling of the U.S. Department of Education. Frank Cannon, president of American Principles Project, said in a statement prior to the announcement of DeVos\u2019 nomination: President-elect Trump rightly slammed Governor Jeb Bush for his support of Common Core on the campaign trail. Betsy DeVos would be a very Jeb-like pick, and the idea that Trump would appoint a Common Core apologist as Secretary of Education seems unlikely. https://twitter.com/transition2017/status/801489495338188800 In a news release, the campaign says: \u201cBetsy DeVos is a brilliant and passionate education advocate,\u201d said President-elect Donald J. Trump. \u201cUnder her leadership we will reform the U.S. education system and break the bureaucracy that is holding our children back so that we can deliver world-class education and school choice to all families. I am pleased to nominate Betsy as Secretary of the Department of Education. I am honored to accept this responsibility to work with the President-elect on his vision to make American education great again,\u201d said Ms. DeVos. \u201cThe status quo in education is not acceptable. Together, we can work to make transformational change that ensures every student in America has the opportunity to fulfill his or her highest potential.\u201d",

Ought we not to have a no-buy list for students who are obviously troubled, have been expelled, are in mental health programs and who post YouTube videos of the sort that this kid did? Don\u2019t we need a superintendent to be able to go to a police chief and say this kid can\u2019t have a gun? The secretary responded: [T]here have, apparently were lots of signs. And I think it\u2019s critically important that we have a much more robust conversation around tracking and tackling mental health issues, and really bringing this all together, because it\u2019s clear that, it seems to be clear that this young man put up lots and lots of signals and warning signs. Hewitt asked whether the department of education should use its \u201cspending authority\u201d to incentivize school districts to develop systems in which they work with local law enforcement to observe someone who is believed to be a threat. DeVos replied that while such an idea \u201cwould be a very important part of the conversation,\u201d she would ultimately like to see Congress hold hearings on the issues. She continued: And we\u2019ve seen lots of discussion about this every time we\u2019ve had another incident, we\u2019ve seen you know, lots of finger pointing back and forth. But we need to have a conversation at the level where lawmakers can actually impact the future, because going back to and putting myself in the seat of one of those families impacted, you know, one of these shootings is one too many. And we have got to have an honest conversation, and Congress has to lead on this. It\u2019s their job. Asked by Hewitt if the education department would consider withholding funding from school districts that do not hire military officers \u201cwho are credentialed at the federal level,\u201d DeVos replied the question \u201clends itself to a broader conversation around the notion that too many kids today are really stuck in schools that are not working for them.\u201d The secretary, who has made school choice a primary goal, said, \u201c[W]e need the kind of freedom in education that is going to allow parents to find schools that fit their child\u2019s learning styles, their personality, and bring about a lot more creativity in how we actually help kids learn and get educated.\u201d Alleged shooter Nikolas Cruz, 19, was a former student at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, who had been expelled.

            "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
            "content": " DeVos\u2019s statement\u00a0follows a report in the New York Times which suggests she was at odds with the president and Attorney General Jeff Sessions over changing Obama\u2019s pro-transgender policy. The education secretary, whose confirmation was the subject of unprecedented controversy, released the following statement Wednesday evening: We have a responsibility to protect every student in America and ensure that they have the freedom to learn and thrive in a safe and trusted environment. This is not merely a federal mandate, but a moral obligation no individual, school, district or state can abdicate. At my direction, the Department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights remains committed to investigating all claims of discrimination, bullying and harassment against those who are most vulnerable in our schools. The statement continues that \u201cno immediate impact\u201d will be experienced by students due to the reform of the Obama era pro-transgender guidance since a federal court issued a nationwide injunction against the policy last August. In her statement, DeVos echoes the comments of White House spokesman Sean Spicer earlier in the day regarding the Trump administration\u2019s decision to leave the issue of transgender students\u2019 bathroom and locker room use to the states. The secretary said: This is an issue best solved at the state and local level. Schools, communities, and families can find \u2013 and in many cases have found \u2013 solutions that protect all students. I have dedicated my career to advocating for and fighting on behalf of students, and as Secretary of Education, I consider protecting all students, including LGBTQ students, not only a key priority for the Department, but for every school in America. We owe all students a commitment to ensure they have access to a learning environment that is free of discrimination, bullying and harassment. As Breitbart News reported, Trump is planning to reform the Obama directive which declares children can change their gender simply by announcing they have the \u201cgender identity\u201d of the opposite sex and, therefore, should be permitted to use the bathrooms and shower rooms of whichever sex they identify with at any given time. The Times reports an apparent dispute between DeVos and Trump and Sessions over the transgender bathroom issue: The question of how to address the \u201cbathroom debate,\u201d as it has become known, opened a rift inside the Trump administration, pitting the education secretary, Betsy DeVos, against Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Mr. Sessions, who had been expected to move quickly to roll back the civil rights expansions put in place under his Democratic predecessors, wanted to act decisively because of two pending court cases that could have upheld the protections and pushed the government into further litigation. But Ms. DeVos initially resisted signing off and told Mr. Trump that she was uncomfortable because of the potential harm that rescinding the protections could cause transgender students, according to three Republicans with direct knowledge of the internal discussions. According to Breitbart News, however, Spicer minimized the dispute between DeVos and the president\u00a0and Sessions. \u201cThere\u2019s no daylight between anybody \u2014 between the president, between any of the secretaries,\u201d Spicer said during a press conference, adding: I think there\u2019s been some discussion between the timing of the issuance and recommendations \u2014 or between the exact wording. But as far as the conclusions go, I\u2019ve made this clear and the president\u2019s made it clear throughout the campaign that he is a firm believer of states\u2019 rights and that certain issues like this are not best dealt with at the federal level. Heritage Foundation senior research fellow Ryan Anderson\u00a0applauded the Trump administration\u2019s decision to reverse the Obama era transgender bathroom directive. \u201cThe Trump administration today corrected Obama\u2019s unlawful directives that violated the rights of students\u2013particularly girls,\u201d Anderson said in a statement.\u00a0\u201cThis move returns authority over the issue to parents and teachers in the states, allowing them to work through to find a win-win solution for all students.\u201d Anderson further urged Congress to clarify that \u201csex\u201d does not mean \u201cgender identity\u201d with regard to interpretation of civil rights statutes. \u201cThis would ensure that unelected bureaucrats and judges would not be allowed to reshape policy that affects women and girls,\u201d he added. A very small proportion of Americans attempts\u00a0to live as members of the opposite sex. Only\u00a0about 1-in-2,400 Americans, for example, have changed their names from one sex to the other, according to a study of the 2010 census. The American College of Pediatricians\u00a0maintains that gender ideology is harmful to children and that transgendered children are psychologically confused and at risk for mental health disorders. The College states: No one is born with a gender. Everyone is born with a biological sex. Gender (an awareness and sense of oneself as male or female) is a sociological and psychological concept; not an objective biological one\u2026 A person\u2019s belief that he or she is something they are not is, at best, a sign of confused thinking. When an otherwise healthy biological boy believes he is a girl, or an otherwise healthy biological girl believes she is a boy, an objective psychological problem exists that lies in the mind not the body, and it should be treated as such. These children suffer from gender dysphoria. Gender dysphoria (GD), formerly listed as Gender Identity Disorder (GID), is a recognized mental disorder in the most recent edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association (DSM-V)\u2026 \u201cAccording to the DSM-V, as many as 98% of gender confused boys and 88% of gender confused girls eventually accept their biological sex after naturally passing through puberty,\u201d the College asserts. \u201cConditioning children into believing that a lifetime of chemical and surgical impersonation of the opposite sex is normal and healthful is child abuse.\u201d Youth Trans Critical Professionals\u00a0\u2014 a group of self-described \u201cleft-leaning, open-minded, and pro-gay rights\u201d professionals, says it is risky to affirm young people who claim to be transgender and provide them with hormonal and surgical treatments to change their bodies. \u201cOur concern is with medical transition for children and youth,\u201d say Youth Trans Critical Professionals on their website. \u201cWe feel that unnecessary surgeries and/or hormonal treatments which have not been proven safe in the long-term represent significant risks for young people.\u201d \u201cPolicies that encourage \u2014 either directly or indirectly \u2014 such medical treatment for young people who may not be able to evaluate the risks and benefits are highly suspect, in our opinion,\u201d says\u00a0the organization, which is composed of psychologists, social workers, doctors, and other professionals. The professionals express \u201calarm\u201d that, because of the current trendiness of being transgendered, many young people have decided they are a member of the opposite sex simply as a result of \u201cbinges\u201d on social media sites. They describe a process of transgender activists recruiting these young people for their \u201ccult.\u201d \u201cThere is evidence that vulnerable young people are being actively recruited and coached on such sites to believe that they are trans,\u201d the professionals say. Despite such potential mental health problems associated with gender confusion, children who claim to be the opposite sex are no longer legally permitted to see a therapist to receive\u00a0\u201cconversion therapy\u201d in some states. Youth Trans Critical Professionals sees such state prohibitions as dangerous since they may block the process of critical thinking and evaluation of the young person regarding the reasons why he or she desires to become a transgender member of the opposite sex. \u201cWhile the sentiment behind this legislation is laudable, in some cases, it is being interpreted to mean that therapists cannot explore gender identity with a youth who is professing to be trans,\u201d argue the professionals. \u201cThis would mean we can\u2019t ask why; we can\u2019t explore underlying mental health issues; we can\u2019t consider the symbolic nature of the gender dysphoria; and we can\u2019t look at possible confounding issues such as social media use or social contagion.\u201d",

            "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
            "content": " DeVos addressed students and faculty at George Mason University Thursday in long-awaited remarks on the enforcement of Title IX and the need to establish a regulatory framework that serves the needs of all students. The secretary criticized the Obama administration\u2019s 2011 Dear Colleague letter, in which it sought to end cross-examination of alleged victims by students accused of sexual assault in campus courts and rejected the traditional clear-and-convincing evidence standard of proof in school disciplinary procedures. DeVos said: The era of \u201crule by letter\u201d is over. Through intimidation and coercion, the failed system has clearly pushed schools to overreach. With the heavy hand of Washington tipping the balance of her scale, the sad reality is that Lady Justice is not blind on campuses today. This unraveling of justice is shameful, it is wholly un-American, and it is anathema to the system of self-governance to which our Founders pledged their lives over 240 years ago. DeVos made herself clear at the start of her address that \u201cacts of sexual misconduct are reprehensible, disgusting, and unacceptable. They are acts of cowardice and personal weakness, often thinly disguised as strength and power.\u201d Unlike her predecessors in the Obama administration, however, she gave significant attention to the problem of those students who are accused of sexual assault and denied their due process. \u201cWe need to remember that we\u2019re not just talking about faceless \u2018cases,\u2019\u201d the secretary said.\u00a0\u201cWe are talking about people\u2019s lives. Everything we do must recognize this before anything else.\u201d She said the system put into place by the Obama administration has failed both alleged sexual assault victims and the accused. \u201cSurvivors, victims of a lack of due process and campus administrators have all told me that the current approach does a disservice to everyone involved,\u201d DeVos said, describing the Obama administration\u2019s approach: Here is what it looks like: a student says he or she was sexually assaulted by another student on campus. If he or she isn\u2019t urged to keep quiet or discouraged from reporting it to local law enforcement, the case goes to a school administrator who will act as the judge and jury. The accused may or may not be told of the allegations before a decision is rendered. If there is a hearing, both the survivor and the accused may or may not be allowed legal representation. Whatever evidence is presented may or may not be shown to all parties. Whatever witnesses\u2014if allowed to be called\u2014may or may not be cross-examined. And Washington dictated that schools must use the lowest standard of proof. And now this campus official\u2014who may or may not have any legal training in adjudicating sexual misconduct\u2014is expected to render a judgment. A judgment that changes the direction of both students\u2019 lives. The right to appeal may or may not be available to either party. And no one is permitted to talk about what went on behind closed doors. It\u2019s no wonder so many call these proceedings \u201ckangaroo courts.\u201d DeVos said \u201ceveryone loses\u201d in the current system which some say \u201cprotects survivors and thus must remain untouched.\u201d \u201cBut the reality is it doesn\u2019t even do that,\u201d she added. \u201cSurvivors aren\u2019t well-served when they are re-traumatized with appeal after appeal because the failed system failed the accused. And no student should be forced to sue their way to due process.\u201d The secretary addressed the trend the intimidating Obama-era guidance has promoted in which \u201cany perceived offense can become a full-blown Title IX investigation.\u201d She said: Schools have been compelled by Washington to enforce ambiguous and incredibly broad definitions of assault and harassment. Too many cases involve students and faculty who have faced investigation and punishment simply for speaking their minds or teaching their classes. Any perceived offense can become a full-blown Title IX investigation. But if everything is harassment, then nothing is. Punishing speech protected by the First Amendment trivializes actual harassment. It teaches students the wrong lesson about the importance of free speech in our democracy. Harassment codes which trample speech rights derail the primary mission of a school to pursue truth. DeVos said her department will launch \u201ca transparent notice-and-comment process to incorporate the insights of all parties in developing a better way.\u201d \u201cWe will seek public feedback and combine institutional knowledge, professional expertise, and the experiences of students to replace the current approach with a workable, effective, and fair system,\u201d she said.\u00a0\u201cTo implement sustainable solutions, institutions must be mindful of the rights of every student. No one benefits from a system that does not have the public\u2019s trust\u2014not survivors, not accused students, not institutions and not the public.\u201d DeVos was condemned by feminists and LGBT activists in July for inviting students who have been falsely accused of and disciplined for sexual assault under the Obama-era Title IX guidance. Under the guidance, the Obama administration instructed schools to use the \u201cpreponderance of the evidence standard to resolve complaints of sex discrimination,\u201d which is used in most civil actions. To promote its policy, Obama\u2019s deputies in the federal education department engaged the media by consistently pushing the myth that \u201cone in five\u201d college-age women in the U.S. will be sexually assaulted before they leave college. \u201cThe agency\u2019s figures are wildly at odds with the official crime statistics,\u201d nevertheless, began a fact-check video with AEI resident scholar and former philosophy\u00a0professor Christina Hoff Sommers, who studies the politics of gender and feminism. According to the Bureau of Justice, the real rate of rape on college campuses is actually closer to 1 in 500. However, armed with the false \u201cone in five\u201d statistic, the Obama administration threatened to cut funding to colleges and universities who did not implement the guidance in its Dear Colleague letter.",

            "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
            "content": " \u201cParents, educators, and grassroots activists across the state of Michigan know exactly who DeVos is and her position on Common Core,\u201d Karen Braun tells Breitbart News the day after DeVos joined Trump in Grand Rapids at a \u201cThank You\u201d tour stop in her state. \u201cWe\u2019re not fooled by a single, carefully parsed statement on a webpage that she is \u2018not a supporter \u2013 period,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cWe know the truth.\u00a0We experienced it first hand.\u00a0So have many Michigan lawmakers; but for some reason they continue to stay silent and give DeVos a complete pass. Loyalty to DeVos trumps loyalty to the truth, apparently.\u201d DeVos told the crowd at the rally that \u201cmaking education great again\u201d means \u201cfinally putting an end to the federalized Common Core.\u201d But Michigan Common Core opponents want to know when she will come to the aid of parents and educators who have been trying to repeal the standards in her own state. An advocate primarily of school choice and school vouchers, DeVos said that putting \u201ckids first\u201d means \u201cexpanding choices and options to give every child the opportunity for a quality education regardless of their zip code or their family circumstances.\u201d \u201cThis means letting states set their own high standards and finally putting an end to the federalized Common Core,\u201d she added. Braun responds: DeVos\u2019 parsing on Common Core is going to become harder to maintain the more she speaks on education\u2026[Her] use of the qualifier \u201cfederalized\u201d is telling.\u00a0DeVos likely believes Common Core is a high standard and a quality choice for states; otherwise she would be with us at Stop Common Core in Michigan, fighting it to get it out, and replacing it with the pre-Common Core Massachusetts standards.\u00a0She\u2019s not. Neither is GLEP [Great Lakes Education Project.]\u00a0GLEP opposes SB 826 through their partnership with the Michigan Coalition for High Student Standards. DeVos has funded and served on the board of GLEP, an organization that promotes school choice and is a supporter of Common Core. \u201cWe appreciate the work of the State Senate in supporting the Common Core State Standards, which we believe will make our students more competitive in a global economy,\u201d said Gary Naeyaert, executive director at GLEP, in October of 2013. DeVos\u2019 website says she was chairman of the GLEP board from 2001-2008, and has remained a board member since then. Yet, upon her nomination as education secretary, DeVos launched a new website, and noted immediately, \u201cCertainly. I am not a supporter\u201d of Common Core. \u201cPeriod.\u201d Braun explains to Breitbart News how DeVos\u2019 vision of education reform intersects \u201cschool choice\u201d with \u201cCommon Core.\u201d \u201cIn a DeVos system of \u2018choice,\u2019 parents will choose WHERE their child is educated but WHAT they are taught is not up to them,\u201d Braun continues, quoting from a report from the American Federation for Children,\u00a0on which DeVos has served as a board member since 2008 and has been its chairman since 2009. \u201cThrough educational choice, parents are empowered with the ability to choose the environment\u2014whether it is a traditional public school, charter school, private school, virtual school, home school or blended learning\u2014that best suits their children\u2019s needs,\u201d the report read. \u201cThat\u2019s not true choice and will result in the destruction of educational freedom for all parents,\u201d Braun states. Braun\u2019s assertion is shared by many homeschoolers as well. In May of 2015, Breitbart News featured comments from homeschooling parents across the country who reject the idea of school vouchers, the transfer of taxpayer funds from public schools to private, religious, or even homeschools. In January of 2015, the Wisconsin Parents\u2019 Association, a grassroots homeschooling organization, expressed its adamant opposition to school vouchers for homeschoolers in an open letter: Programs that give public moneys to homeschoolers would undermine our freedom to homeschool, as would legislation that attempts to guarantee our rights and freedoms. Government \u201cfavors\u201d would require that homeschools be accountable to the government, which would make homeschools more like public schools. Our goal is to make your job as easy as possible and our homeschooling as successful as possible. No new homeschooling legislation is needed, and essentially any legislation would have drawbacks and risks. \u201cParents already have rights and responsibilities,\u201d continued WPA. \u201cThey come from God or nature, not the government. Proposals that supposedly guarantee parental rights backfire because they give the government a way to define and control fundamental rights.\u201d Tina Hollenbeck, a homeschooling parent in Wisconsin, underscores that sentiment for Breitbart News: It\u2019s really imperative that homeschoolers remember there is never, ever, ever a \u201cfree lunch.\u201d In other words, the offer of vouchers for homeschoolers is a Trojan horse and will \u2013 at some point by someone \u2013 undoubtedly result in increased regulation that will steal parents\u2019 academic freedom. This already happens in private religious schools that take voucher students \u2013 i.e., bureaucrats require that \u201cparochial\u201d content in such schools be removed from instruction \u2013 and there is no reason to believe that similar restrictions would not be strongly enforced on homeschoolers, too. We should not be fooled. Our parental freedom to educate our children according to our own convictions is worth far more than the bowl of pottage represented by voucher dollars. Braun says that she has been in touch with parent activists in Missouri, Texas, Oklahoma, Indiana, and other states, who know well how influential and wealthy special interests like the DeVos family and their funded organizations have\u00a0blocked efforts to repeal Common Core. \u201cThey all have the same sentiment, that DeVos is not against Common Core and has done nothing to help our state remove it,\u201d she says, and adds: SB 826, I\u2019m told,\u00a0is dead. No one wants to touch it.\u00a0State Senate Majority Leader Meekhof will not move it. DeVos through GLEP will make sure of it.\u00a0Or it will be so watered down so we have a bill that pro-Common Core Gov. Rick Snyder will sign.\u00a0A bill that he will sign is a bad bill and does nothing. Braun notes the companion bill in the state House \u2013 HB 5444 \u2013 could be reintroduced in January. \u201cBut unless there are a few more people willing to cross DeVos, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s going anywhere,\u201d she explains.\u00a0\u201cHB 5444 is sponsored by Rep. Gary Glenn who I believe is principled and against Common Core. But will he be able to break through the loyalty so many in Lansing have for the DeVos machine?\u00a0I\u2019m not so sure.\u201d \u201cThe fact that so many lawmakers in Lansing know the truth about DeVos and are giving her a pass tells me it is an uphill battle,\u201d she concludes.",

            "content": " Sunday night\u2019s installment of 60 Minutes found the struggling education secretary responding to a question by Stahl as to why she has become \u201cthe most hated Cabinet secretary,\u201d and agreeing that, yes, \u201cMaybe I should\u201d visit underperforming schools in the United States, after admitting she has not. On the issue of arming qualified teachers who want such a duty as a means of keeping schools safer, DeVos responded such an option should be available, but then volunteered, \u201cI hesitate to think of, like, my first-grade teacher, Mrs. Zorhoff, I couldn\u2019t ever imagine her having a gun and being trained in that way.\u201d \u201cThe problem with the interview was that Secretary DeVos accepted the slanted premises of every question and simply tried to apologize or answer within them,\u201d Manhattan Institute senior fellow Max Eden tells Breitbart News. During one portion of the interview, Stahl questions DeVos about the state of schools in her home state of Michigan, where DeVos was actively involved in promoting school choice and charter schools: Lesley Stahl: Now, has that happened in Michigan? We\u2019re in Michigan. This is your home state. Betsy DeVos: Michi\u2013Yes, well, there\u2019s lots of great options and choices for students here. Lesley Stahl: Have the public schools in Michigan gotten better? Betsy DeVos: I don\u2019t know. Overall, I\u2013 I can\u2019t say overall that they have all gotten better. Lesley Stahl: The whole state is not doing well. Betsy DeVos: Well, there are certainly lots of pockets where this\u2013 the students are doing well and\u2014 Lesley Stahl: No, but your argument that if you take funds away that the schools will get better, is not working in Michigan where you had a huge impact and influence over the direction of the school system here. Betsy DeVos: I hesitate to talk about all schools in general because schools are made up of individual students attending them. Lesley Stahl: The public schools here are doing worse than they did. Betsy DeVos: Michigan schools need to do better. There is no doubt about it. Lesley Stahl: Have you seen the really bad schools? Maybe try to figure out what they\u2019re doing? Betsy DeVos: I have not\u2013 I have not\u2013 I have not intentionally visited schools that are underperforming. Lesley Stahl: Maybe you should. Betsy DeVos: Maybe I should. Yes. Eden explains to Breitbart News how DeVos should have responded to these questions. \u201cWhen Lesley Stahl says, \u2018What about your awful record in Michigan with school choice?\u2019 the answer should be, \u2018Actually, Michigan charters performed substantially better than traditional public schools there,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201c\u2019And we\u2019ve seen great successes there. And there are obviously problems in Detroit \u2013 huge problems in Detroit \u2013 but the charter schools are doing so much better than the pubic schools there, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to blame the problems we see in public schools on these other schools that are doing better.\u2019\u201d  Eden and the Cato Institute\u2019s Jason Bedrick wrote at EducationNext in January 2017 about the data from Stanford University\u2019s Center for Research on Education Outcomes (CREDO), which shows that Michigan\u2019s charter schools performed better than public schools. CREDO states: Compared to the educational gains that charter students would have had in a traditional public school (TPS), the analysis shows that, on average,\u00a0students in Michigan charter schools make larger learning gains in both reading and mathematics. Thirty-five percent of the charter schools have significantly more positive learning gains than their TPS counterparts in reading, while two percent of charter schools have significantly lower learning gains. In math, forty-two percent of the charter schools studied outperform their TPS peers and six percent perform worse. These findings position Michigan among the highest performing charter school states CREDO has studied to date. Regarding charter schools in Detroit, CREDO says: \u201cCharter students in the city of Detroit (27% of the state\u2019s charter students), are performing even better than their peers in the rest of the state, on average gaining nearly three months achievement for each year they attend charter schools.\u201d \u201cSo, there\u2019s a clear answer to that question,\u201d Eden continues. \u201cIt\u2019s to deny the premise and to put forward an alternative interpretation, to put forward her own philosophy. Unfortunately, DeVos answered the questions as they were asked, rather than articulating her own philosophy and beliefs.\u201d On the issue of the Obama-era school discipline policy of incentivizing school districts to reduce suspensions, expulsions, and arrests for minority students based on the premise that teachers engage in \u201cinstitutional racism,\u201d Stahl asked DeVos, \u201cDo you see this disproportion in discipline for the same infraction as institutional racism?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re studying it carefully,\u201d responded DeVos. \u201cAnd are committed to making sure students have opportunity to learn in safe and nurturing environments.\u201d \u201cSo Stahl said to DeVos,\u201d explains Eden, \u201c\u2019Don\u2019t you think that when white and black students do the same thing, and black students are punished more severely, that that\u2019s institutional racism?\u2019 On the one hand, obviously, even when that happens, that\u2019s racist, and that was illegal before the Obama-era \u2018guidance.\u2019 But, the guidance is not about disparate treatment. It\u2019s about disparate impact. The guidance is not about providing supports. It\u2019s about forcing school districts to adopt loose discipline policies. But, DeVos simply accepted the false premise of the question, and then you can\u2019t provide a good response.\u201d Erin Tuttle, a parent activist from Indiana and a co-author of the book Deconstructing the Administrative State: The Fight for Liberty, notes to Breitbart News, \u201cAs Secretary of Education,\u00a0it\u2019s DeVos\u2019s job to make the case to the American people on the need to reverse the Obama-era guidance on school discipline policies referenced by Stahl.\u201d \u201cDespite the numerous legal and practical arguments for reversing such guidance, which, according to Sen. Marco Rubio allowed the Florida shooter to go undetected by law enforcement, DeVos offered none,\u201d she adds. \u201cHer lack of answers isn\u2019t doing this Administration any favors.\u201d Eden observes the Trump presidency and his administration have had a major theme of not accepting premises set by the media. \u201cTo not just answer the question as asked, but try to tell the public what you think is true, what you believe, and how you believe it,\u201d he adds. \u201cSecretary DeVos has not been able to draw the connection between her beliefs in choice and deregulation. She believes in choice, not because it\u2019s a market thing, but because teachers should have freedom. And that\u2019s what deregulation is, too. It\u2019s about that the best way to go is to give teachers the freedom to do what they think is right. And that\u2019s the missing link in her philosophy in which she believes, but has not articulated forcefully enough.\u201d \u201cShe needs to deny the premise,\u201d Eden asserts, stating the media at this point is very hostile toward her. \u201cThey want to paint her into a corner and she is insisting on coloring within the lines.\u201d The left-wing media has largely ignored conservatives\u2019 issues with DeVos from the announcement of her nomination to her post, including her avid support for organizations that have promoted the Common Core standards, her insistence that the massive federal Every Student Succeeds Act has ended Common Core \u2013 when most states are still using the standards even if under a different name, and her decision to surround herself with advisors who have also worked for her close friend, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.",

            "content": " HuffPost\u00a0reported that DeVos\u2019s \u201cBack-to-School tour\u201d included a visit Thursday to Harrisburg Catholic Elementary School in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Harrisburg. The headline read, \u201cBetsy DeVos To Promote School That Bans Transgender Students And Staff.\u201d Other media reported in a similar vein. CNN reported, \u201cDeVos to Visit School that Refuses to Accommodate Trans Students.\u201d CBS News reported, \u201cSecretary of Education Betsy DeVos Visits School with Anti-Transgender Policy.\u201d The Olean Times Herald\u00a0reported, \u201cPA: Secy DeVos Visits Anti-Trans School in Harrisburg.\u201d The Catholic Diocese of Harrisburg has a specific stated policy, adopted in 2015, for its own students regarding \u201cGender Identity Questions.\u201d The policy was adopted as gender ideology began to be mandated and inserted into public school education throughout the country. The policy distinguishes between situations in which children are born with \u201csexually ambiguous genitalia\u201d and those in which \u201cthe gender identity question is psychological in origin.\u201d \u201cCatholic educators as well as all other members of the school staff and community are called to be witnesses to Jesus Christ and His Church,\u201d the Harrisburg Roman Catholic diocese states, and continues: In the first instance, where the sex of a child may be indeterminate at birth, one requiring time and medical testing before establishing an existing or dominant sex, it is common pastoral practice to collaborate with parents and medical professionals as they try to make a prudential determination on their child\u2019s actual biological sex. This policy addresses the circumstances where there is a clear biological determination of a person\u2019s sex and subsequent efforts to chemically and/or surgically alter the given biology. This is understood in Catholic moral terms as self-mutilation and therefore immoral. To attempt to make accommodations for such persons would be to cooperate in the immoral action and impose an unacceptable burden on others in the school community. In a recent interview with The College Fix, noted Johns Hopkins psychiatrist Dr. Paul McHugh warned\u00a0that many in the medical and psychiatric industries \u201cwill come to regret\u201d the ease with which they are now experimenting on children who claim to be transgender. McHugh said treating young people with hormones and surgeries to change their appearance to be more in keeping with the opposite sex is \u201cexperimental\u201d and \u201ccomparable to doing frontal lobotomies.\u201d He agrees that gender identity dysphoria and confusions \u201care mostly driven by psychological and psychosocial problems these people have.\u201d The Harrisburg Catholic school policy continues that parents who choose to enroll their children in a Catholic school understand that they will not act in opposition to Catholic teaching. \u201cNotification of a student\u2019s determination to undergo a sex change procedure or that a student has undergone the procedure (condition #2 as described above) would violate that agreement,\u201d the policy adds. \u201cThe student would be ineligible to attend or remain in attendance in a Catholic school.\u201d CNN described DeVos\u2019s visit to the Catholic school \u2013 part of her annual tour promoting school choice \u2013 as another \u201cbrush with controversy over transgender rights.\u201d Another member of the Trump administration, Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Ben Carson, also angered\u00a0the left when he expressed concern about biological men claiming to be women inserting themselves into homeless women\u2019s shelters. The Washington Post\u00a0based its report on the matter on the comments of \u201cthree [anonymous] people present who interpreted the remarks as an attack on transgender women.\u201d The report continued: While visiting HUD\u2019s San Francisco office this week, Carson also lamented that society no longer seemed to know the difference between men and women, two of the agency staffers said. Carson\u2019s remarks visibly shocked and upset many of the roughly 50 HUD staffers who attended Tuesday\u2019s meeting, and prompted at least one woman to walk out in protest, the staffers said. Carson has a history of making dismissive comments about transgender people. While running for president, he referred to transgender people as \u201cabnormal\u201d and said they should not be in the military. As HUD Secretary, he weakened Obama-era protections for transgender people, saying he believes in equal rights, not \u201cspecial rights.\u201d According to the Post, one of the anonymous HUD staffers said Carson conveyed the sentiment that biological men claiming to be women \u201cwere not women.\u201d \u201cLike we shouldn\u2019t force people to accept transgender people in this context because it makes other people uncomfortable,\u201d the staffer reportedly said.",

            "content": "  The summit will take place November 29-December 1 in Nashville, Tennessee. DeVos and Bush are old friends since DeVos was both a donor and a board member of Bush\u2019s foundation prior to being confirmed to her current post. Common Core advocate Bush championed DeVos\u2019s nomination as federal education secretary with the Trump administration within days of Donald Trump\u2019s election victory. Bush asked DeVos if she would be interested in the top federal education post and then asked Vice President-elect Mike Pence to recommend her for the job. \u201cHe was really the only person I knew in the transition,\u201d Bush told Tim Alberta, writing for Politico magazine. \u201cHe was the best person, because he was running it.\u201d Bush added that it turned out that both he and Pence \u2013 two former GOP governors \u2013 had the same thought since both had worked with DeVos to advance their education agendas in their home states of Florida and Indiana, respectively. \u201cHe made it clear that he was already thinking about Betsy, too,\u201d Bush said of Pence. Once Trump formally nominated DeVos, Bush announced publicly he was \u201cexcited.\u201d The foundation will feature a session titled \u201cReal Faces of Education Choice.\u201d DeVos has been an ardent advocate of school choice and charter schools. In announcing DeVos\u2019s address at the summit, Bush\u2019s foundation described the secretary as an \u201cadvocate for children and a voice for parents.\u201d \u201cAs secretary, DeVos continues to advocate for returning control of education to states and localities, giving parents greater power to choose the educational settings that are best for their children, and ensuring that higher education puts students on the path to successful careers,\u201d the announcement continued. In the new federal budget, DeVos\u2019s department had requested an additional $1.4 billion into school choice programs by increasing funding for charter schools by $168 million, instituting a new $250 million private school voucher program, and boosting the Title I program by $1 billion for states and school districts that allow students to use the funding at the public school of their choice, Breitbart News reported. The House, however, did not include DeVos\u2019s requests in its budget. According to her interview with Politico, DeVos said, \u201cWell, let\u2019s keep in mind that this is only the first budget cycle. There are other budget cycles.\u201d Bush\u2019s foundation\u2019s summit is convening in a state that has consistently rejected school vouchers to enable students in low-performing public schools to attend school elsewhere, reports Chalkbeat: Even as money has increasingly flowed into Tennessee to promote vouchers and voucher candidates,\u00a0including cash\u00a0from DeVos\u2019s American Federation for Children, the proposal to provide students with state-funded tuition to attend private schools\u00a0failed again\u00a0this year to clear the state\u2019s House of Representatives. (The Senate has passed the legislation three times. Lawmakers will take up the matter again in January.) Sponsors of the Bush foundation summit include\u00a0the College Board, whose president is Common Core \u201carchitect\u201d David Coleman; the Walton Family Foundation; ExxonMobil; textbook publishers Pearson and McGraw Hill; digital learning corporation Amplify; Charter Schools USA; and State Farm.",

Several big-name universities were included in the department\u2019s report, included the University of Southern California, Georgetown University, Yale University, Wake Forest University, the University of Texas at Austin, and Stanford University. \u201cThe allegations made and evidence cited by the Department of Justice raise questions about whether your institution is fully meeting its obligations,\u201d an education department official wrote in a statement. The Education Department has demanded that the named schools turn over various documents related to their admissions process. Some of the requested documents, such as marketing materials, are available to the public. Other requested information, such as internal policies and procedures, are private to the universities. The Department of Justice reported earlier this month that dozens of parents had allegedly used bribes and other tactics to deceitfully earn admission for their children to some of the nation\u2019s top universities. Celebrities Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman were two of the parents named in the report. Loughlin was accused of fabricating an athletic profile for her daughter, Olivia Jade. Jade was ultimately admitted to USC as a crew recruit. The scheme was allegedly organized by William \u201cRick\u201d Singer, who ran a college preparatory business that appeared to help students with the college admissions process. In reality, Singer funneled money from parents to various university contacts in exchange for help in the admissions process. In some instances, Singer helped students cheat on exams by placing them in controlled testing facilities in which hired proctors would correct the student\u2019s incorrect answers before the exam was submitted. Stay tuned to Breitbart News for more updates on this story.",

The consortium was established to combine the resources of each university\u2019s Middle East Studies departments. The Department of Education received a complaint from Rep. George Holding (R-NC) over alleged antisemitic rhetoric at a federally-funded conference hosted by the consortium on Gaza. In a letter to Rep. Holding, Betsy DeVos stated that the UNC-Duke Consortium risks losing its federal funding if it cannot present a fair and unbiased perspective on the information that it presents. \u201cThis includes a requirement under Section 602 (e)(1) of the HEA that grantees must use funds to support activities that \u201creflect diverse perspectives and a wide range of views and generate debate on world regions and international affairs,'\u201d DeVos wrote. DeVos went on to argue in the letter that she will move to pull the funding from the UNC-Duke Consortium if it cannot comply with the law. I am troubled by the concerns outlined in your letter. In order for the Department to learn more about this matter, I have directed the Office of Postsecondary Education to examine the use of funds under this program to determine if the Consortium violated the terms and conditions of its grant, Department regulations, or the HEA. It is critical that recipients of grants use funds in accordance with statutory and regulatory requirements, as well as for purposes of the program for which they are funded. Rep. Holding thanked Secretary DeVos for her action on the issue. \u201cI\u2019d like to thank Secretary DeVos for treating this matter with the seriousness and attention it deserves,\u201d Representative Holding said on the investigation. \u201cI hope we can all agree that it is irresponsible and immoral for taxpayer dollars to fund overtly biased advocacy under the guise of constructive academic discourse.\u201d ",

Ruddock\u2019s name appears on a ProPublica list of Trump administration officials who do not require scrutiny by the U.S. Senate. Chalkbeat reports: Before joining Bush\u2019s\u00a0foundation (where DeVos served on the board) in 2012, Ruddock headed school choice programs in Indiana\u2019s education department policy and research office for three years. During his tenure, the state launched and then expanded a school voucher program that could be a model as DeVos seeks to expand school choice across the country. On his LinkedIn page, Ruddock describes his work at Bush\u2019s FEE: Connected Foundation policy experts to state legislators, executive branch staff and local education advocacy groups; While serving as director of school choice programs in the Indiana Department of Education, Ruddock says he: Ruddock also served as a policy analyst for Educational Testing Service (ETS) from 2005 to 2008, where he \u201cserved as a liaison between ETS executives in Princeton and its lobbyists in key state capitols,\u201d and \u201canalyzed state policy trends in assessment.\u201d Other U.S. education department staffers who worked for Bush\u2019s pro-Common Core foundation and for the Indiana education department include Andrew Kossack, who is listed as a \u201cspecial assistant to the secretary.\u201d Kossack is an attorney who was appointed as Indiana Department of Revenue commissioner under former Gov. Mike Pence. Prior to that position, he served as general counsel to Indiana\u2019s ousted\u00a0superintendent of education, Tony Bennett, who championed the adoption of the Common Core standards in the state. Bennett then became the Florida commissioner of education and was\u00a0later investigated for fraud and resigned\u00a0after allegations\u00a0that he intervened in the grading system in Indiana to favor\u00a0a charter school run by a prominent Republican Party donor. Rob Goad, an aide to Indiana Rep. Luke Messer, served as the main advisor to the Trump administration on education policy during the transition, reports Politico. Messer, a supporter of school choice, backed\u00a0Bush in the GOP primary, as reported by The Hill. \u201cI\u2019ve watched this primary carefully and believe Jeb Bush is uniquely qualified to lead our nation out of the morass created by the current administration,\u201d Messer said November 2015. \u201cJeb\u2019s record in Florida proves he\u2019s a man of his word, a true conservative reformer who can change Washington and fix the big things that are broken with our federal government. I\u2019m all in for Jeb, and think he would make a terrific Commander-in-Chief.\u201d Another current U.S. education department staff member who worked with Bush at his foundation is Josh Venable, listed now as \u201csenior advisor to the secretary.\u201d",

            "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
            "content": " But parent activists are suggesting Trump is getting the wrong advice from his transition team. Writing at Townhall, Indiana activist and researcher Erin Tuttle and American Principles Project education fellow Jane Robbins assert Trump\u2019s transition team \u201cmay be ignoring the concerns of the most populist movement American politics has seen since Reagan: the parents and teachers fighting Common Core.\u201d Citing many of the reported potential candidates\u2019 associations with ardent Common Core supporter Jeb Bush, Tuttle and Robbins note: DeVos has served on [Jeb Bush\u2019s] foundation\u2019s board of directors. Among these \u201cexperts\u201d from Jebworld are alumni of Bush\u2019s Chiefs for Change (Gerard Robinson and Tony Bennett) and former members of Bush\u2019s gubernatorial education team (Hanna Skandera). All of these candidates predictably support progressive education in general and Common Core in particular. Indeed, Bennett was booted out of his position as Indiana State School Superintendent for that very reason. Why would Trump even consider someone coming out of the environment on which he heaped such scorn during the campaign? West Michigan Politics reported that, like Donald Trump himself, the DeVos family has donated to the Clinton Foundation: According to a WMP analysis of Clinton Foundation records, the DeVos family donated between $60,000-$130,000. The Doug and Maria DeVos Family Foundation donated between $50,000-$100,000. The Dick and Betsy DeVos Family Foundation donated between $10,000-$25,000 Dave DeVos donated between $1,000-$5,000. Bloomberg also reported in July of 2015 that former President Bill Clinton \u201coften earned higher speech fees, especially abroad. Amway paid him $700,000 for a February 2013 speech in Japan.\u201d A report at the Detroit News in July states that DeVos, a former Michigan Republican Party chair, was an at-large delegate for pro-Common Core Ohio Gov. John Kasich. Kasich received a grade of \u201cF\u201d at The Pulse 2016 for his support of the controversial standards. The former presidential candidate referred to parent activists in his state fighting against the Core as a \u201crunaway internet campaign.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s just say that I will be a more than interested bystander at the convention,\u201d DeVos said. The Detroit News continued: DeVos is attending the Republican National Convention as an at-large delegate for Ohio Gov. John Kasich while her wealthy and influential West Michigan family backed Florida Sen. Marco Rubio during the primaries. \u2026 DeVos acknowledged she has some misgivings with Trump but did not elaborate on why she\u2019s withholding her support for the party\u2019s presumptive nominee. Meanwhile, a Buzzfeed report states \u201cRepublican mega donor\u201d Betsy DeVos has \u201cdeclared herself an opponent of the Common Core education initiative.\u201d Buzzfeed continues: DeVos is in most ways a conventional choice for the position: a longtime advocate of alternatives to the public school system, with close ties to many on Capitol Hill, she is closely aligned to Republican education officials like Sen. Lamar Alexander and serves on the board of Jeb Bush\u2019s education foundation. She has also proclaimed herself an opponent of the Common Core education initiative, which Trump often denounced at his rallies with promises of a \u201crepeal,\u201d though she initially supported the standards. Shane Vander Hart, however, writes at Truth in American Education that Molly Hensley-Clancey\u2019s report at Buzzfeed that DeVos is an opponent of Common Core is less than accurate. \u201cYes she is very much part of the Republican education establishment, but where Hensley-Clancey got the idea that she proclaimed herself an opponent of the Common Core education initiative is beyond me,\u201d Vander Hart writes. \u201cBetsy DeVos through the Great Lakes Education Project (GLEP) and Michigan Freedom Fund tried to influence Michigan\u2019s Republican primaries.\u201d Karen Braun who heads up Stop Common Core in Michigan wrote: GLEP is a strong supporter of the Common Core and its continued implementation in Michigan. They are part of the\u00a0Michigan Coalition for High Student Standards\u00a0which opposes SB 826 to Repeal and Replace Common Core, science, social studies, and aligned assessments with pre-common core Massachusetts standards.\u00a0Stop Common Core in Michigan believes there is a high correlation between candidates who accept the GLEP endorsement and their future votes on legislation. GLEP claims NOT to have a litmus test on Common Core.\u00a0This allows candidates to say they are against common core and still gain the endorsement of GLEP.\u00a0\u00a0But DeVos\u00a0is a champion for \u201cschool choice\u201d while at the same time continuing the implementation of common national standards.\u00a0The DeVos definition of \u201cschool choice\u201d is the freedom to choose which common core school will track your child from cradle-to-career (P20).\u00a0All Michigan charters must use common national standards. That\u2019s NOT true choice. Like Bill Gates, Betsy DeVos has some money and has some things she\u2019d like to see different.\u00a0Like all good investors, DeVos likely expects a return on her investment. And if you don\u2019t play the game under their rules and vote the way you want her to vote, you may find yourself challenged the next time you run for office. \u201cDeVos\u2019 involvement with GLEP which supports Common Core and with the Foundation for Excellence in Education should make any denunciation of Common Core from DeVos\u2019 lips suspect,\u201d Vander Hart concludes. Braun also tells Breitbart News because DeVos refused to support Trump at the Republican National Convention, she is skeptical of whether she would commit to Trump\u2019s stated goal of removing the federal government from education. \u201cDisloyalty should not be rewarded with a cabinet post,\u201d Braun asserts. \u201cHer lobby group, GLEP, supports common core and P-20 competency based education or so called \u201cschool choice. I hope President-Elect Trump and the rest of the transition team think long and hard about this appointment.\u201d Frank Cannon, president of American Principles Project, also released the following statement: From the very beginning of his campaign, President-elect Donald Trump promised an end to the failed Common Core standards. He repeatedly assured parents across the heartland that he intended to return power over education to local schools. It is puzzling, then, to see reports that the Trump transition team is considering an establishment, pro-Common Core Secretary of Education \u2013 this would not qualify as \u2018draining the swamp\u2019 \u2013 and it seems to fly in the face of what Trump has stated on education policy up to this point. President-elect Trump rightly slammed Governor Jeb Bush for his support of Common Core on the campaign trail. Betsy DeVos would be a very Jeb-like pick, and the idea that Trump would appoint a Common Core apologist as Secretary of Education seems unlikely. We remain hopeful that Trump will pick a Secretary of Education who will return control over education to parents and local school districts \u2013 someone like Bill Evers, Sandra Stotsky, or Larry Arnn \u2013 and not someone who will simply rebrand and repackage the failed Common Core standards that were so thoroughly rejected by voters in both the GOP primary and in the November election. Similarly, Tuttle and Robbins conclude, \u201cConservatives in the anti-Common Core movement are beginning to fear that the transition team\u2019s agenda has replaced Trump\u2019s, and that the grassroots activists will once again be sold out to the education establishment.\u201d",

            "content": " The House Education and the Workforce Committee heard complaints for more than two hours Tuesday from state education officials about the DeVos department\u2019s criticism of their state education plans \u2013 still required to be submitted under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), a bill that was passed in December of 2015 as a replacement for No Child Left Behind. As Education Week reports, for example, federal officials told Delaware it could not use Advanced Placement courses as a measure of \u201ccollege- and career-readiness,\u201d although the same plan was accepted for Louisiana and Tennessee. Delaware was also told its stated long-term academic goals were not \u201cambitious\u201d enough, though that term is not defined in ESSA, and that its plan to use science and social studies test scores for accountability purposes would violate the federal law. A Nevada education official said his state was told to revise its education plan by removing its science tests as indicators of core academic achievement, school quality, and student success. Federal education officials told New Mexico the state should specify its plan to ensure low-income and minority students do not have disproportionately higher rates of less experienced or ineffective teachers. Additionally, DeVos\u2019s department said the state should more clearly describe its plan to ensure all students are prepared for advanced math in 8th\u00a0grade, as ESSA requires. Similarly, Connecticut, Louisiana, and Tennessee were told they could not use their science test scores to prove accountability in the same way as their reading and math scores, and federal officials informed New Jersey it must be more specific about the criteria for removing schools from the \u201clowest performing\u201d list. At one point, as Education Week reports, the federal education department released what was considered a clarifying statement, that its review feedback to states \u201cis not an approval or denial of a state plan; however, a state is still required to submit a plan that complies with all statutory requirements.\u201d To date, 16 states and the District of Columbia have filed their education plans, seeking approval from the federal government under ESSA. In a statement about her department\u2019s review of state plans, DeVos said: I am committed to returning decision-making power back to states and setting the Department up to serve the support and monitoring roles intended by Congress. The Department worked with states to ensure their plans included all statutorily required components laid out in the Department\u2019s revised template. I commend officials from these states for their efforts to ensure their plans were ready for the peer-review process, and for their continued work to improve education for all students. The New York Times noted irritation with the DeVos department\u2019s actions on the education plans, particularly on the matter with Delaware: In the department\u2019s letter to Delaware\u2014which incited the most outrage from conservative observers\u2014[Acting Assistant Secretary for Elementary and Secondary Education Jason] Botel took aim at the state\u2019s plan to halve the number of students not meeting proficiency rates in the next decade. Such a goal would have resulted in only one-half to two thirds of some groups of students achieving proficiency, he noted. The department deemed those long-term goals, as well as those for English-language learners, not ambitious, and directed the state to revise its plans to make them more so. Cato\u2019s education policy director Neal McCluskey writes he would have thought the Trump administration would have been more deferential to states with ESSA. He concludes: And so we remain pretty much where we were\u00a0under the Obama administration\u00a0in education, and where we are with every law that leaves it to regulatory agencies to fill in the meaning of crucial terms: with states, localities, and the people at the mercy of bureaucrats and secretaries. Government increasingly of men and not laws. Like many Republican lawmakers who voted in favor of ESSA, DeVos has been promoting the law as a vehicle to eliminate the federalized Common Core standards and return education policy back to the states and local governments. However, under ESSA \u2013 as it was passed by Congress \u2013 states are required to seek approval from the federal government for their accountability systems and plans for how they will show they are meeting criteria for accepting\u00a0the federal government\u2019s taxpayer funds. These plans must include an expansive array of activities, such as how states will assess the success of teachers, students, schools, and school districts, and what they propose to do if they are not successful in achieving their goals. ESSA tasks the education department with reviews of these state plans as well as the power to approve or deny them. Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-TN), chairman of the Senate\u2019s education committee, proudly boasted ESSA was passed in \u201cbipartisan\u201d fashion, and that former President Barack Obama signed Alexander\u2019s bill\u00a0almost immediately into law. \u201cWe have reversed the trend toward a national school board, repealed the federal Common Core mandate, and enacted what the\u00a0Wall Street Journal\u00a0called \u2018the largest devolution of federal control to states in a quarter century,\u201d Alexander\u00a0announced upon the passage of the bill. In April, citing ESSA, DeVos\u00a0said, \u201cThere really isn\u2019t any Common Core anymore,\u201d adding the federal law \u201cdoes away with the whole argument about Common Core.\u201d According to\u00a0Education Week, however, \u201cat least 37 states\u201d were\u00a0still using\u00a0the Common Core standards or its rebrands as of the end of last year. Senior fellow at American Principles Project Emmett McGroarty\u00a0at The National Pulse, following the approval of ESSA,\u00a0wrote: Anti-Common Core activists tried for months to warn Congress that the new federal education bill \u2026 was a disaster that would cement, not overturn, the odious progressive-education philosophies of the Obama Administration. Now comes confirmation that the activists were dead on \u2014 and that Republican leadership, including Sen. Lamar Alexander, Rep. John Kline, and House Speaker Paul Ryan, carried out a cynical scheme to betray their constituents and give the Administration everything it wanted. Parent activists and education scholars who studied ESSA prior to its passage sounded the alarm that the federal law neither repeals the Common Core mandate nor prohibits the education secretary from coercing states into adopting the standards. \u201cWithin the other 1,060 pages of ESSA lurk the provisions that will keep states in Common Core, or something that looks very much like Common Core,\u201d American Principles Project senior fellow Jane Robbins and Indiana parent activist Erin Tuttle also\u00a0wrote\u00a0at The National Pulse. \u201cThe Secretary won\u2019t have to mandate anything, because the other parts of the bill contain the requirements for \u2026 \u2018high standards,\u2019\u201d a phrase that has come to refer to Common Core. Robbins and Tuttle quote the ESSA law and translate the Common Core rhetoric: \u201cEach State shall demonstrate that the challenging academic standards are aligned with entrance requirements for credit-bearing coursework in the system of public higher education in the State and relevant State career and technical education standards.\u201d This is simply another way of saying states must have \u201ccollege- and career-ready\u201d standards. And as made clear by the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s own\u00a0materials, \u201ccollege- and career-ready\u201d means Common Core. To help states with their ESSA plans, DeVos\u2019s department released in March a \u201crevised consolidated State plan template\u201d and a guide that refers states to two private organizations, the Council of Chief State School Officers and the National Governors Association \u2013 both of which are the sole owners of the Common Core State Standards \u2013 for assistance \u201cto support the plan submission process.\u201d When President Donald Trump signed an executive order earlier this year to roll back Obama-era education department regulations, DeVos said about ESSA, \u201cWe\u2019re going to implement this law as Congress intended, not how the previous administration dictated. When we give decision-making power back to states and communities, students benefit.\u201d The key phrase, however, is \u201cas Congress intended.\u201d [TWEET]  Establishment Republicans have attempted a narrative that, with ESSA, they have turned education policy back to the states and negotiated a darn good \u201cbipartisan\u201d deal with their Democrat colleagues. The problem is that, as with Obamacare, continued federal overreach into education is exactly what \u201cCongress intended.\u201d These same Republican lawmakers are now hearing a multitude of complaints and are distancing themselves from DeVos\u2019s department. \u201cI think we have a case of an assistant secretary [Jason Botel] who hasn\u2019t read the law carefully,\u201d Alexander\u00a0told Education Week regarding the complaints. \u201cThe heart of the entire law \u2026 was that it\u2019s the state\u2019s decision to set goals, to decide what \u2018ambitious\u2019\u00a0means, to make decisions to help schools that aren\u2019t performing well.\u201d The report continues: So why is Alexander speaking out now?\u00a0He opened the\u00a0New York Times recently and saw that Botel had been quoted\u00a0saying that, because ESSA doesn\u2019t explain exactly what \u201cambitious\u201d means with respect to state student achievement goals, it\u2019s up to the secretary to define it for states. That doesn\u2019t jibe with Alexander\u2019s understanding of the law. \u201cNot only did we not authorize the Department of Education to define the word ambition, we specifically prohibited it,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cThat\u2019s what the law says, in plain terms.\u201d And the education chairman is also unhappy that DeVos has told some states that they may not be able to use Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, and honors courses to measure college-and-career readiness. Botel\u00a0served\u00a0as executive director of the Maryland education advocacy group\u00a0MarylandCAN\u00a0\u2013 which was\u00a0financed\u00a0by Bill Gates \u2013 and has a history of support for Common Core. DeVos will be testifying to the House Education and the Workforce Committee about the state ESSA plans, among other issues. Following a hearing in which she heard the testimony of state education officials on the ESSA plans, current committee chairwoman Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-NC), who also supported ESSA, said, according to U.S. News & World Report: Part of [the education law\u2019s] goals for state and school district autonomy was to force Washington to remain at arm\u2019s length from states and school districts when it comes to education, and rest assured that this committee will be watching to ensure Washington keeps its distance. \u201cI think that a lot of what it boils down to is a subject we deal with a lot in this committee \u2026 and that is the role of the federal government in education,\u201d she added. Joy Pullmann, author of The Education Invasion: How Common Core Fights Parents for Control of American Kids, tells Breitbart News the core problem \u201cis the fact that we have a federal Education Department at all, which Congress has charged with executing a swamp full of counterproductive and fanciful mandates that nobody, not angels themselves, could improve student achievement by carrying out.\u201d The managing editor at The Federalist explains: The simple truth is that Congress is ill-suited to tell the nation\u2019s 35 million schoolkids and 3.2 million teachers what they should all be doing. Nobody except God knows that, and Congress isn\u2019t God. It needs to get a big dose of humility and strip federal law of ineffective trillion-dollar unicorn-land education programs, and send it all back to the states. Congress can\u2019t pass hopes into law and expect bureaucrats to fill in the blanks without becoming a major pain in the petunias. Pullmann recommends the Trump education department simply stop enforcing \u201cCongress\u2019s vague mandates.\u201d \u201cIt should also compile a list of the unenforceable and counterproductive programs it has overseen now for nearly sixty years to no measurable benefit to Americans, and send the whole lot to Congress for repeal,\u201d she adds. \u201cThey can start with the work of the Independence Institute\u2019s Vicki Alger, whose latest book will give them a rock-solid roadmap for precisely that endeavor.\u201d Robbins also observes to Breitbart News that, thus far, there is not much difference between the Obama and Trump education departments: There have been a few hopeful signs of policy changes under DeVos, but even those have been tentative. Overall, the new sheriff looks a lot like the old sheriff. It\u2019s baffling to the conservative grassroots that DeVos and many of her appointees seem to be completely disregarding what President Trump repeated again and again during the campaign \u2014 no to Common Core, yes to restoring local control over education. \u201cIt\u2019s beginning to look a little insulting,\u201d she adds.",

            "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
            "content": " \u201cThe Every Student Succeeds Act [ESSA], which is in the process of being implemented now, essentially does away with the whole argument about Common Core,\u201d DeVos said, adding: Each state can set the standards for their state. They may elect to adopt very high standards for their students to aspire to and work toward. That will be up to each state to be able to ascertain what is right for that state. We hope that all of them will have very high expectations.\u201d The secretary\u2019s comments come in sharp contrast with President Donald Trump\u2019s statement at a CEO Business Town Hall several weeks ago. During that meeting, Trump returned to his campaign promise to end the Common Core standards and once again make education policy the domain of state and local governments. \u201cCommon Core, I mean, we have to bring education more local,\u201d Trump said at the White House. \u201cWe can\u2019t be managing education from Washington.\u201d The president continued: When I go out to Iowa, when I go out to the different states and I talk, they want to run their school programs locally and they\u2019ll do a much better job\u2026 And I like the fact of getting rid of Common Core. You know, Common Core, to me, we have to end it. We have to bring education local, to me. I\u2019ve always said it, I\u2019ve been saying it during the campaign, and we\u2019re doing it. DeVos\u2019s statement is similar to that of other establishment Republicans in Congress. In December of 2015, Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-TN), chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, touted that he and Democrat Sen. Patty Murray (WA) had facilitated the \u201cbipartisan\u201d passage of the ESSA measure that would replace the George W. Bush-era No Child Left Behind (NCLB). President Barack Obama signed the bill into law almost immediately, referring to it as a \u201cChristmas miracle.\u201d \u201cWe have reversed the trend toward a national school board, repealed the federal Common Core mandate, and enacted what the\u00a0Wall Street Journal\u00a0called \u2018the largest devolution of federal control to states in a quarter century,\u201d Alexander\u00a0said. A\u00a0statement\u00a0on Sen. Richard Burr\u2019s (R-NC) website following the signing of ESSA into law also said the measure had succeeded in \u201crepealing the common core mandate.\u201d \u201cThis is a big deal,\u201d Burr said about the new law. \u201cIt will bring an additional $24 million per year in funding to poorest children in North Carolina and put a stop to the Common Core mandate.\u201d Establishment Republicans based their pronouncements on the portion of ESSA that\u00a0states, \u201cThe federal government is prohibited from \u2026 Mandating, directing, controlling, coercing, or exercising any direction or supervision over academic standards that states develop or adopt, including Common Core State Standards.\u201d Parent activists and education scholars who have studied the law, however, assert ESSA neither repeals the Common Core mandate, nor prohibits the education secretary from coercing states into adopting the standards. In fact, those who have been battling against Common Core in the states say ESSA actually does the opposite: it keeps states anchored to the controversial education reform. \u201cWithin the other 1,060 pages of ESSA lurk the provisions that will keep states in Common Core, or something that looks very much like Common Core,\u201d American Principles Project (APP) education fellow Jane Robbins and Indiana parent activist Erin Tuttle\u00a0wrote\u00a0at The Pulse 2016. \u201cThe Secretary won\u2019t have to mandate anything, because the other parts of the bill contain the requirements for \u2026 \u2018high standards,\u2019\u201d a phrase that has come to refer to Common Core. ESSA also requires every state to submit its education plan for approval to the U.S. Department of Education. Robbins and Tuttle assert: That plan must be \u201ccoordinated\u201d with 11 federal statutes, including the Soviet-style\u00a0Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act\u00a0passed a year ago; the\u00a0Education Sciences Reform Act,\u00a0which is all about collecting student data for research; the\u00a0Child Care and Development Block Grant Act, which adds to the Head Start requirements on preschool standards; and the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) Authorization Act, which governs the\u00a0NAEP test\u00a0that will almost certainly be\u00a0aligned to Common Core\u00a0to hide the fact that Common Core-trained students perform poorly on NAEP. Requiring state plans and therefore state standards to coordinate with all these federal statutes means, as a practical matter, states will keep Common Core. The\u00a0ESSA law also says,\u00a0\u201cEach State shall demonstrate that the challenging academic standards are aligned with entrance requirements for credit-bearing coursework in the system of public higher education in the State and relevant State career and technical education standards.\u201d \u201cThis is simply another way of saying states must have \u2018college- and career-ready\u2019 standards,\u201d say Robbins and Tuttle. \u201cAnd as made clear by the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s own\u00a0materials, \u2018college- and career-ready\u2019 means Common Core.\u201d Upon Trump\u2019s comments earlier this month that \u201cwe have to end Common Core,\u201d American Principles Project senior fellow Emmett McGroarty said, \u201cToday\u2019s comments show that President Trump has not forgotten his promise to end Common Core and return to local control of education.\u201d McGroarty added that Trump\u2019s leadership on the elimination of Common Core in the states is vital from this point forward. \u201cEvery Swamp creature will unite to fight against the president on this, so his leadership will be critical,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe look forward to seeing what steps the Trump Administration will take in the coming months to take power away from Washington D.C. and return it to parents.\u201d",

            "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
            "content": " DeVos is taking her federalized school choice plan to Congress where it will be introduced in legislation in the Senate by Texas Sen. Ted Cruz (R) and in the House by Rep. Bradley Byrne, a Republican from Alabama. Many who have been urging the Trump administration to dismantle the federal education department, however, warn\u00a0another federalized program will further expand overreach into education. The U.S. Constitution provides for no federal role in education, except in the nation\u2019s capital, in the military, and among Native American tribes. \u201cWhile school choice is\u00a0critical\u00a0and often undervalued, a federal school choice program reaches beyond the constitutional mandate of the federal government, and presents a real danger to private education in the future,\u201d wrote\u00a0Inez Feltscher Stepman at the Federalist Thursday. \u201cIf it passes, this latest example of federal overreach could be the Trump administration\u2019s equivalent to the Common Core debacle, and worse, could taint one of the most important reforms advanced by conservatives in the states.\u201d As U.S. News & World Report\u00a0observed, under DeVos\u2019s proposal, individuals and companies would obtain a federal tax credit if they donate to organizations offering scholarships to students to attend the schools of their choice. Individuals and companies would be allowed to donate up to ten percent of their adjusted gross income. Many of the details of the federalized program, such as who is eligible, education providers permitted to participate, and accountability for the federal taxpayer funds would be given to the states \u2013 although, as with Common Core, the incentive to create such programs would come from the federal government. \u201cThis is an opportunity for states to take advantage of money that would be available to them, for programs that they design,\u201d said\u00a0an unnamed education department official, according to Education Week. In her prepared remarks announcing the Education Freedom Scholarships and Opportunity Act, DeVos said her plan was not a \u201cmandate,\u201d but then focused\u00a0on her vision of how the federal government would incentivize states to sign onto her new plan: The key element of the proposal is freedom. Freedom for everyone involved. Students, families, teachers, schools, states can choose to participate in the program. Or they can elect not to participate. That\u2019s what freedom is all about. Let me be clear: I firmly believe every state should embrace education freedom. But those are decisions families and communities must make. This is not another mandate. We know gaining this freedom will require more work in some states than others. But as more states offer more options to families, demand will rise and pressure will mount on those who have not yet embraced the opportunity. While conservatives and constitutionalists heartily support parental choice of education options, they draw a bold line where the federal government takes over the project or incentivizes states to enact it through federal taxpayer funds. Neal McCluskey, Cato Institute\u2019s director of the Center for Educational Freedom, tweeted the title of his blog post that spells out his concerns about the new federalized plan:  \u201cSchool choice is about individualization and freedom, and almost certainly that is what DeVos, Cruz, and Byrne want,\u201d McCluskey wrote. \u201cBut federal initiatives are a terrible way to deliver that. The reality is that what the feds fund, even indirectly, they inevitably want to control.\u201d He continued: DeVos, Cruz, and Byrne are looking to skirt the control problem, sticking with tax credits instead of vouchers, and letting states opt in. But not only is this unconstitutional\u2014taxes are authorized to execute specific, enumerated powers, not to lightly engineer state policy\u2014it won\u2019t, ultimately, prevent encroaching federal control. If enacted, the credit would spur people to demand their states participate, and as more schools benefited from federally connected scholarships all schools would be financially pressured to use them. But the federal government will have the power to decide which state programs are or are not eligible, and on what grounds. Wisconsin homeschooling parent Tina Hollenbeck told Breitbart News the proposal is \u201cwell-meaning, but misguided.\u201d \u201cDeVos even alluded to the fact that the federal government would use pressure to \u2018encourage\u2019 every state to take these \u2018scholarships,\u2019 which means she\u2019d also \u2018encourage\u2019 eventual collection of data on all homeschoolers, not just the ones taking the credit,\u201d Hollenbeck said. \u201cThat should chill every homeschooler to the bone! I do not believe such a consequence is part of Sen. Cruz\u2019s motivation, but that doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t happen. \u201d Lindsey Burke, director of the Heritage Foundation\u2019s Center for Education Policy, and\u00a0Adam Michel, a senior policy analyst in the Grover M. Hermann Center for the Federal Budget, warned such an effort could actually reverse the school choice gains already made as well as recent tax policy reforms. \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful that the Administration wants to advance school choice but a nationwide federal tax-credit scholarship program is the wrong way to do it,\u201d they said\u00a0in a statement. \u201cThis could open the door for further education regulations down the road that neutralize the advantages of private education as well as impede future tax reform efforts.\u201d Burke and Michel highlighted the concerns voiced often by the conservative base of Trump\u2019s Party, including that such a proposal \u201cwould grow, rather than reduce, federal intervention in education.\u201d \u201cFuture administrations could use a federal tax-credit scholarship to require that schools adhere to certain admissions and accountability policies,\u201d they added. \u201cThat would mean the federal government could further dictate testing, reporting, academic content, and even bathroom policies for all schools involved.\u201d Stepman also warned that because parental choice of education options is so important, \u201cwe should be loathe to expose it to the heavy hands of federal regulators.\u201d \u201cEven if Republicans get a perfectly clean version of the tax credit through Congress\u2014a tall order given the composition of the House\u2014the door would be open for future Democratic administrations to extend a regulatory toehold into every private school that accepted students on scholarship,\u201d she asserted.

DeVos asserts that in these countries, \u201cfreedom in education isn\u2019t controversial \u2013 it\u2019s common sense.\u201d The secretary is a proponent of school choice \u2013 the provision of federal funds for both public and private schools \u2013 as well as personalized and social and emotional learning (SEL), in which personality, psychological, and attitudinal data are collected on students to improve education outcomes.    DeVos highlights some of the key features she observed on her tour: In the countries I visited, education is oriented around the distinct needs of each student. In the Netherlands, freedom in education is enshrined in the constitution, which requires that the state provide equal funding for both publicly run and private schools. Two-thirds of students in the Netherlands attend schools that are privately run and taxpayer funded. \u2026 In England, greater autonomy at the school level has been encouraged with the creation of \u201cacademies,\u201d similar to charter schools in the United States, and \u201cfree schools,\u201d both of which are granted significantly more flexibility for educators. Under Prime Minister David Cameron, the number of academies greatly increased, and free schools were created to serve as incubators of innovation and improve student achievement. Today, more than 70 percent of secondary schools in England have adopted the academy or free school model. \u2026 Switzerland is known for its robust apprenticeship program, with more than two-thirds of high school students engaged in one of the roughly 300 government-recognized apprenticeships.  The secretary bemoans the fact that U.S. students have been falling behind on international standardized tests. \u201cIn science and math, students in Switzerland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom outperformed U.S. students on the most recent Program for International Student Assessment,\u201d she explains. \u201cThe United States ranked 23rd in reading, 25th in science, and 40th in math. If we finished 40th in the Olympics there\u2019d be a national outcry!\u201d While DeVos\u2019s comments are directed principally toward those public school advocates who continually want more federal funding funneled into a public education system that appears to be failing, the conservative and constitutionalist base of the Republican Party maintains a federal role in education and workforce development not only does not exist in the Constitution, but its continued presence means greater regulation and more data collection of students in order to meet the workforce needs of big corporations. Additionally, though DeVos has stated publicly that the Common Core standards are \u201cdead,\u201d education policy watcher Shane Vander Hart of Truth in American Education wrote earlier this year that the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), \u201cengineered by Sens. Lamar Alexander (R-TN) and Patty Murray (D-WA) \u2013 essentially cemented\u00a0Common Core into every state in the country.\u201d \u201cSure, the U.S. Department of Education is not actively pushing Common Core, they don\u2019t need to,\u201d he observed. \u201cThe standards and assessment consortiums don\u2019t need to be funded anymore. The damage is done.\u00a0They don\u2019t need to publicly push it because ESSA essentially codified Common Core.\u201d Jane Robbins, senior fellow at American Principles Project, told Breitbart News: It\u2019s troubling that so many education policy-makers, including Secretary DeVos, are drawn to the European system of the school-to-work pipeline. Revamping our entire system to create cogs for politically connected companies isn\u2019t the way to \u201ccatch up.\u201d If she\u2019s really concerned about math scores on international tests, it would be more effective to assure states they won\u2019t be penalized for replacing the deficient Common Core math standards with good standards. Similarly, during a Breitbart News interview, Eunie Smith, president of the Eagle Forum, expressed her concerns about a merger of the Departments of Education and Labor. \u201cThe type of education the individual receives would be influenced by crony corporations dictating to schools the skills needed for future workers,\u201d she warned. \u201cAnd the preferences of big business are already disproportionately represented in \u2018the swamp.\u2019 Officially blending the education and labor systems would raise cronyism to new levels.\u201d Smith also observed the concerns about the privacy of student data.\u00a0She said her own state of Alabama has a longitudinal data system that combines the data from at least ten different agencies of state government into one centralized state data base. \u201cThat\u2019s a minefield for anybody who gets into that data base,\u201d she said, adding that the economy President Donald Trump says he wants will not happen with a merger of the two departments. \u201cCentralized, government-planned economies do not work, and that\u2019s not the free market system under which America and our economy have prospered,\u201d Smith explained. \u201cOur president knows that. But this is contrary to that. And even though the proposed merger of the Departments of Education and Labor is going to be presented as a downsizing of the federal government, it\u2019s not going to play out that way, and we will have a move toward government-planned economy.\u201d",

            "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
            "content": "  The declaration, which was produced at this first gathering of the \u201cEducation Working Group\u201d of the G-20 governments and dictatorships, was titled \u201cBuilding Consensus for Fair and Sustainable Development,\u201d and calls for globalization of education, inclusiveness, social and emotional learning, and increasing data collection on students throughout their educations and well into their careers. In her prepared remarks\u00a0to the G-20 education ministers in Argentina, DeVos brought forward her goal for workforce development, or government management of the workforce, which the Trump administration has recently stressed in its proposal\u00a0to merge the U.S. Departments of Education and Labor. \u201cIndeed, education and the economy are indivisible, especially given the interconnectedness of the world today,\u201d DeVos said, emphasizing that while each child is \u201can individual,\u201d governments should approach education by acknowledging \u201cthe realities of today\u2019s economy, with an eye toward tomorrow\u2019s opportunities.\u201d \u201cSo, students must be prepared to anticipate and adapt,\u201d she said. \u201cThey need to acquire and master broadly transferrable and versatile educational competencies like critical thinking, collaboration, communication, creativity and cultural intelligence.\u201d The secretary also stressed her signature issues of school choice and vocational apprenticeships in her remarks. The declaration specifically states the G-20 education ministers are \u201cin line with the United Nations 2030 Agenda,\u201d and continues: It is important that education keeps pace with societal and technological innovations such as Artificial Intelligence, Big Data and Internet of Things. We recognise that changes in the economy and labour markets have profound implications for education and training systems even though many of them remain unpredictable. Acknowledging the autonomy and diversity of national, regional and local governments and contexts, emerging knowledge and 21st century skills should be considered in curriculum development and pedagogical approaches at all levels of education. The curricula should be highly responsive to evidence-based practices, future employment trends, and design in collaboration with key stakeholders. The education ministers note that while \u201cincreased investments in education above certain thresholds do not necessarily entail better outcomes,\u201d the way to achieve their goals is through \u201cstrengthening governance, management, monitoring and accountability,\u201d methods that involve greater government control of education. The G-20 education ministers continue: We commit to facilitating the internationalisation of education, including the cross-border recognition of qualifications and skills, and the mobility of students, teachers, academic and non-academic staff, trainers and researchers, with a view to improving quality education and research, and in accordance with the respective national laws, rules and policies. We support the promotion of exchange and scholarships programmes among G20 members and other countries, in particular with developing countries around the globe. \u201cUnderstanding and appreciating other parts of the world, different religions, cultures, languages and points of view are essential elements of global and cultural competence,\u201d the education leaders say. In addition to urging \u201cdigital literacy,\u201d the education ministers say they will \u201cfoster the inclusion of non-cognitive skills such as socio-emotional skills across the curriculum [\u00a0SEL].\u201d Following the summit, DeVos told reporters the declaration is \u201cvery consistent with all of the themes that we\u2019ve been talking about,\u201d\u00a0reported\u00a0Education Week. \u201cUltimately, the meeting resulted in a declaration that calls for putting education \u2018at the center of the global agenda,\u2019\u201d the report added. \u201cIt says the G-20 nations will work to \u2018ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all.\u2019\u201d DeVos said the United States can learn from other G-20 countries, who are making more progress in the area of developing the 21st\u00a0Century skills. \u201cThere are too many other countries that are\u00a0further down the path of adopting some of these themes and embracing some of these opportunities,\u201d she said. U.S. Parents Involved in Education (USPIE) \u2013 an organization of parents, taxpayers, and educators who are committed to ending the U.S. Department of Education, has called for the dismissal of DeVos. On Tuesday, USPIE sent a letter\u00a0to President Donald Trump in which the group called for the elimination of the U.S. Department of Education, per the Constitution, and the end to federal education programs. In its letter, USPIE reminded Trump of his campaign promises to eliminate Common Core and begin dismantling of the federal education department. \u201cSince her appointment, Secretary DeVos has used the hammer of the Federal government to broaden its authority and disregard the rights of states and parents,\u201d USPIE wrote, adding: Three actions in particular demonstrate this disregard: \u201cWe do not believe these actions are consistent with your \u2018America First\u2019 philosophy nor your campaign promises that generated so much enthusiasm,\u201d the grassroots education group told Trump. \u201cGiven these concerns, we call for the immediate dismissal of Secretary DeVos and for the appointment of an American education leader who will prioritize the fulfillment of your campaign promises.\u201d",

            "subtitle": "In interim guidance released Friday, U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos ended the campus sexual misconduct policies put forward by former President Barack Obama, stating\u00a0that, while colleges must continue to combat sexual misconduct on campus, the process must be \u201cfair and impartial,\u201d and inspiring \u201cconfidence in its outcomes.\u201d",
            "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
            "content": " Following up on her announcement earlier this month that she is scrapping the Obama administration\u2019s policies regarding cases of sexual misconduct on college campuses, DeVos stressed in a new \u201cinterim Q & A\u201d that all students must be protected from discrimination in school proceedings to investigate sexual assault allegations. A statement from the department says it is withdrawing both Obama-era documents concerning campus sexual misconduct: the Dear Colleague Letter on Sexual Violence of April 4, 2011, and the Questions and Answers on Title IX Sexual Violence of April 29, 2014. \u201cThe withdrawn documents ignored notice and comment requirements, created a system that lacked basic elements of due process and failed to ensure fundamental fairness,\u201d the education department states. Moving forward, DeVos\u2019s department plans to solicit comments from stakeholders and members of the public as it prepares new rules for the handling of sexual misconduct cases in schools. The secretary said: In the coming months, hearing from survivors, campus administrators, parents, students and experts on sexual misconduct will be vital as we work to create a thoughtful rule that will benefit students for years to come. We also will continue to work with schools and community leaders to better address preventing sexual misconduct through education and early intervention. \u201cAs I said earlier this month, the era of rule by letter is over,\u201d DeVos added. \u201cThe Department of Education will follow the proper legal procedures to craft a new Title IX regulation that better serves students and schools.\u201d As Breitbart News reported, in a strong address on September 7, DeVos asserted\u00a0the Obama administration\u2019s heavy-handed policy \u2013 that forced colleges and universities to conduct \u201ckangaroo courts\u201d in dealing with accusations of sexual assault \u2013 \u00a0has \u201cfailed.\u201d The secretary criticized the Obama administration\u2019s 2011 Dear Colleague letter, in which it sought to end cross-examination of alleged victims by students accused of sexual assault in campus courts and rejected the traditional clear-and-convincing evidence standard of proof in school disciplinary procedures. DeVos said: The era of \u201crule by letter\u201d is over. Through intimidation and coercion, the failed system has clearly pushed schools to overreach. With the heavy hand of Washington tipping the balance of her scale, the sad reality is that Lady Justice is not blind on campuses today. This unraveling of justice is shameful, it is wholly un-American, and it is anathema to the system of self-governance to which our Founders pledged their lives over 240 years ago. DeVos made herself clear at the start of her address that \u201cacts of sexual misconduct are reprehensible, disgusting, and unacceptable. They are acts of cowardice and personal weakness, often thinly disguised as strength and power.\u201d Unlike her predecessors in the Obama administration, however, she gave significant attention to the problem of those students who are accused of sexual assault and denied their due process. \u201cWe need to remember that we\u2019re not just talking about faceless \u2018cases,\u2019\u201d the secretary said.\u00a0\u201cWe are talking about people\u2019s lives. Everything we do must recognize this before anything else.\u201d She said the system put into place by the Obama administration has failed both alleged sexual assault victims and the accused. The secretary addressed the trend the intimidating Obama-era guidance has promoted in which \u201cany perceived offense can become a full-blown Title IX investigation.\u201d DeVos was condemned by feminists and LGBT activists in July for inviting students to \u201clistening sessions\u201d who have been falsely accused of and disciplined for sexual assault under the Obama-era Title IX guidance. Under the guidance, the Obama administration instructed schools to use the \u201cpreponderance of the evidence standard to resolve complaints of sex discrimination,\u201d which is used in most civil actions. To promote its policy, Obama\u2019s deputies in the federal education department engaged the media by consistently pushing the myth that \u201cone in five\u201d college-age women in the U.S. will be sexually assaulted before they leave college. \u201cThe agency\u2019s figures are wildly at odds with the official crime statistics,\u201d nevertheless, began a fact-check video with AEI resident scholar and former philosophy\u00a0professor Christina Hoff Sommers, who studies the politics of gender and feminism. According to the Bureau of Justice, the real rate of rape on college campuses is actually closer to 1 in 500. However, armed with the false \u201cone in five\u201d statistic, the Obama administration threatened to cut funding to colleges and universities who did not implement the guidance in its Dear Colleague letter.",

            "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
            "content": " DeVos may be at odds with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) when it comes to defining sex as either male or female under Title IX, which prohibits sex discrimination. Transgender ideology, promoted during the Obama administration, however, demands the federal government enforce rules that help people easily switch their legal sex, regardless of biology. In a piece Wednesday, the Washington Post suggested\u00a0divisiveness within the Trump administration over a potential decision to dismiss gender ideology when it comes to identifying individuals. \u201c[T]he Education Department, which implements civil rights law regarding sex discrimination in the nation\u2019s schools and colleges, is not eager to follow HHS\u2019s lead, and the Justice Department is deferring to HHS, according to administration officials,\u201d reported the Post. The report continued: The Health and Human Services Department has been pushing for the change, a fresh and direct aim at transgender rights, hoping other departments embrace that approach for sweeping impact. But it is unclear whether there is support for the broader effort or whether the regulation would be issued at all, as some in the administration are pushing back. \u2026 It\u2019s unclear what the Education Department\u2019s specific concerns are, but for many years, Secretary Betsy DeVos has privately supported lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights and has been reluctant to dial back their protections. According to the Post\u00a0report, President Donald Trump said his administration is \u201clooking at\u201d the issue. \u201cWe have a lot of different concepts right now,\u201d Trump reportedly said. \u201cThey have a lot of different things happening with respect to transgender right now. And we\u2019re looking at it very seriously.\u201d When asked about protecting LGBT individuals, the president said, \u201cYou know what I\u2019m doing? I\u2019m protecting everybody.\u201d The report comes in the wake of a story published\u00a0at the New York Times Sunday that stated\u00a0the newspaper had obtained a memo indicating HHS is \u201cspearheading an effort to establish a legal definition of sex under Title IX.\u201d The Times\u00a0continued: The department argued in its memo that key government agencies needed to adopt an explicit and uniform definition of gender as determined \u2018on a biological basis that is clear, grounded in science, objective and administrable.\u201d The agency\u2019s proposed definition would define sex as either male or female, unchangeable, and determined by the genitals that a person is born with, according to a draft reviewed by [t]he Times. Any dispute about one\u2019s sex would have to be clarified using genetic testing. Supposedly, a proposed rule reflecting the definition would be presented to Attorney General Jeff Sessions by the end of the year. Caitlin Oakley, national spokesperson and senior advisor to the office of the assistant secretary for public affairs at HHS, noted in a statement that the Obama administration\u2019s \u201cbroad definition of \u2018sex\u2019 was enjoined by a federal court on a nationwide basis in December 2016 and the Obama administration did not appeal.\u201d Oakley added: That court found that the Obama administration regulation was overbroad and inconsistent with the text of the 1972 Title IX law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sex. The court order remains in full force and effect today and HHS is bound by it as we continue to review the issue. In February 2017, DeVos released\u00a0a statement asserting her department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights \u201cremains committed to investigating claims of discrimination, bullying, and harassment\u201d against \u201cvulnerable\u201d LGBT students. The statement followed a report in the Times\u00a0that suggested\u00a0the education secretary was at odds with Trump and Sessions over a change in former President Barack Obama\u2019s transgender policy. The change would affect\u00a0individuals\u2019 ability to use whichever public bathrooms and other facilities they wish based on whichever gender identity they were adopting at any given time. The Times\u00a0reported: The question of how to address the \u201cbathroom debate,\u201d as it has become known, opened a rift inside the Trump administration, pitting the education secretary, Betsy DeVos, against Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Mr. Sessions, who had been expected to move quickly to roll back the civil rights expansions put in place under his Democratic predecessors, wanted to act decisively because of two pending court cases that could have upheld the protections and pushed the government into further litigation. But Ms. DeVos initially resisted signing off and told Mr. Trump that she was uncomfortable because of the potential harm that rescinding the protections could cause transgender students, according to three Republicans with direct knowledge of the internal discussions. \u201cEveryone deserves to be treated with respect and HHS\u2019s Office for Civil Rights will continue to vigorously enforce all laws as written and passed by Congress, prohibiting discrimination in healthcare on the basis of\u00a0race, color, religion, national origin, sex, age, and disability,\u201d Oakley said. Addressing privacy and safety concerns, Heritage Foundation senior research fellow\u00a0Ryan Anderson\u00a0has urged\u00a0Congress to clarify that \u201csex\u201d does not mean \u201cgender identity\u201d with regard to interpretation of civil rights statutes. \u201cThis would ensure that unelected bureaucrats and judges would not be allowed to reshape policy that affects women and girls,\u201d he said in a statement. Breitbart News reached out to the Education Department for comment but did not receive a reply. ",

            "author": "Hannah Bleau",
            "content": " TPUSA founder Charlie Kirk facilitated the discussion with DeVos in a Q&A format. The conversation pivoted to a discussion of the failure of the education system\u2013 subpar public schools specifically\u2013 to properly teach students basic civics. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how few students are exposed to the brilliance of these documents and our Founding Fathers,\u201d Kirk said. \u201cHow are you planning to continue to address this problem as we move forward?\u201d \u201cWell, it is a huge problem,\u201d DeVos said before citing a recent statistic demonstrating the severity of the issue. \u201cThe latest statistic that I saw suggested that only about 18 percent of high school seniors had a reasonable understanding of civics and U.S. history,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s a frightening figure when you think about it.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate for the federal government to mandate a specific curriculum nationally to address this,\u201d she added. \u201cI do think it\u2019s appropriate to talk very widely and loudly about the need to have robust civics and American history courses taught in every school across the country and for states, frankly, to adopt the requirement in their state to do so\u201d:  Civics is not the only issue, DeVos said. According to an international assessment cited by DeVos, American schools are falling behind in many other areas as well. \u201cJust to put it in a little bit more in context as well, there\u2019s an international assessment that\u2019s done every three years and countries around the world\u2013 developed and developing countries. Results are compared for academic achievement,\u201d DeVos said earlier in the conversation. \u201cAnd in the latest one, the United States was 24th in reading, 25th in science, and 40th in math,\u201d she continued. \u201cNow, if we had results like that in the Olympics, do you think anyone in our country would stand for that?\u201d she asked. DeVos believes \u201cschool choice\u201d is part of the answer, which she plans to pursue with the establishment of a federal tax credit. \u201cIndividuals and companies could voluntarily donate to 501(c) charitable organizations that would be designated by the states that chose to participate in this tax credit,\u201d DeVos explained. She said: If a state chose to participate and individuals and companies gave voluntarily to that fund, the state would then be able to take a portion of that federal pot and develop or augment programs that they already have in their state to extend scholarship opportunities to families and students in the state. That way, parents would have the opportunity to \u201cchoose a better fit\u201d for their child\u2019s K-12 education, DeVos explained. ",

Indeed, despite the dumbed-down national standards still being in place in almost every state, DeVos falsely claimed that Common Core was \u201cdead\u201d at the Department of Education. In yet another address that at least superficially put forward sound statements reflecting the Constitution\u2019s lack of mention of any federal role in education, DeVos has again failed to convince the base of her party that she actually believes this fact.  Indeed, the education secretary gave a good conservative run-down of the George W. Bush and Obama administrations\u2019 contributions to entrenching the federal government further into education policy via No Child Left Behind (NCLB) and Common Core: Where the Bush administration emphasized NCLB\u2019s stick, the Obama administration focused on carrots. They recognized that states would not be able to legitimately meet the NCLB\u2019s strict standards. Secretary Duncan testified that 82 percent of the nation\u2019s schools would likely\u00a0fail\u00a0to meet the law\u2019s requirements \u2014 thus subjecting them to crippling sanctions. The Obama administration dangled billions of dollars through the \u201cRace to the Top\u201d competition, and the grant-making process not so subtly encouraged states to adopt the Common Core State Standards. With a price tag of nearly four and a half billion dollars, it was billed as the \u201clargest-ever federal investment in school reform.\u201d Later, the Department would give states a waiver from NCLB\u2019s requirements so long as they adopted the Obama administration\u2019s preferred policies \u2014 essentially making law while Congress negotiated the reauthorization of ESEA. However, as Shane Vander Hart writes at Truth in American Education, the \u201creauthorization of ESEA,\u201d i.e., the \u201cbipartisan\u201d Every Student Succeeds Act \u2013 engineered by Sens. Lamar Alexander (R-TN) and Patty Murray (D-WA) \u2013 essentially cemented Common Core into every state in the country: Sure, the U.S. Department of Education is not actively pushing Common Core, they don\u2019t need to. The standards and assessment consortiums don\u2019t need to be funded anymore. The damage is done. They don\u2019t need to publicly push it because ESSA essentially codified Common Core. At best, DeVos\u2019s views on Common Core are murky, and conservatives have never been sold on her statement that she has \u201calways agreed\u201d with Trump that Common Core is a \u201cdisaster.\u201d In fact, DeVos never was a fan of Trump and actually served as an at-large delegate of Common Core supporter John Kasich at the GOP convention in 2016. American Principles Project senior fellows Jane Robbins and Emmett McGroarty write at Townhall: Especially in her home state of Michigan, conservatives were\u00a0discouraged\u00a0by DeVos\u2019s nomination because of her past support of Common Core and her\u00a0efforts\u00a0(through organizations she founded and/or funded) to thwart the parents who opposed them. She\u00a0disavowed\u00a0her previous support and then sought to put the issue to bed by simply\u00a0declaring,\u00a0mistakenly, that \u201cthe Every Student Succeeds Act [ESSA] . . . essentially does away with the whole argument about Common Core.\u201d As Robbins and McGroarty note, in April 2017, the secretary actually said during a Fox News interview, \u201cThere really isn\u2019t any Common Core anymore.\u201d \u201cThe Every Student Succeeds Act, which is in the process of being implemented now, essentially does away with the whole argument about Common Core,\u201d she added. DeVos\u2019s pronouncements that Common Core is \u201cdead\u201d seem disconnected from reality to parents across the country. Education Week\u00a0reported, \u201cat least 37 states\u201d are\u00a0still using\u00a0the Common Core standards or its \u201crebrands\u201d \u2013 renaming the Core with a state-friendly title \u2013 as of the end of 2016. Meanwhile, Education Dive notes Timothy Shanahan, a professor emeritus at the University of Illinois at Chicago \u2013 and one of the authors of the Core, says the standards are still in effect in 42 states. \u201cEven if Common Core were ripped out from the roots, the federally controlled government \u2018education\u2019 system in America would continue to dumb down and indoctrinate students on an industrial scale\u2014literally threatening the future of the nation,\u201d Newman writes. In dulcet conservative tones, DeVos also announced during her AEI address that federal mandates are not working to improve education. The thousands of parents fighting against Common Core in their states for years now have been saying that to establishment Republican and Democratic lawmakers \u2013 but to no avail. DeVos herself, however, continues to plug ESSA \u2013 a federal mandate. \u201cUnder ESSA, school leaders, educators and parents have the latitude and freedom to try new approaches to serve individual students,\u201d she said. \u201cMy message to them is simple: do it!\u201d Vander Hart asserts DeVos should heed her own advice. \u201cThat\u2019s a nice sentiment, but what is Secretary DeVos going to do about it?\u201d he asks. \u201cIf this is something she truly believed she would support the repeal of ESEA instead of touting it in its current form as the Every Student Succeeds Act.\u201d A big part of conservatives\u2019 problem with DeVos\u00a0is the fact that she has invited many followers of her close friend Jeb Bush to advise her. Bush has been a primary supporter of Common Core and school choice. Robbins and McGroarty observe that while DeVos has declared Common Core \u201cdead,\u201d she has followed Bush\u2019s lead in the areas of school choice \u2013 without detailing the mechanisms for bringing about the \u201cchoice,\u201d and \u201cdigital\u201d or \u201cpersonalized\u201d learning \u2013 which is a major platform for student data collection. \u201cShe didn\u2019t mention the central problem with [school choice],\u201d the authors write. \u201c[T]he danger that when the money follows the child, government regulations will be close behind to strip private schools of the characteristics that made them appealing to parents in the first place.\u201d The authors add: [S]o-called personalized learning is actually depersonalized, computerized training rather than genuine education. It replaces a liberal arts education with pared-down workforce-development training that concentrates on \u201cskills\u201d corporations deem necessary for the (current) job market. It props children in front of computer screens that feed them curricula (probably not available for parental review) that children can click through without really learning anything. It indoctrinates children with government-approved attitudes, mindsets, and beliefs. It collects literally millions of data points on children that will allow the government and vendors to create profiles and algorithms that may control each child\u2019s future life path. It minimizes human interaction, converting professional educators into data clerks. Of course, ESSA is fully on board with digital learning and DeVos is fully on board with ESSA. Constitutionalists note that until DeVos can put into action the words she apparently believes make sense to Trump\u2019s constituents, she will continue to have battles with both the left and the conservative wing of her own party. \u201cIf DeVos is sincere about her philosophical rhetoric, she will devote her efforts to three things: freeing the states from all federal mandates to the extent she can under the law; working with Congress to revise ESSA to eliminate all mandates; and creating a workable plan to shut down her department,\u201d Robbins and McGroarty write. \u201cThat would be something conservatives can cheer.\u201d Newman warns, however: \u201cT]he fact that DeVos continues to dishonestly try to mislead Americans into believing Common Core is \u2018dead\u2019 should alarm everyone. It\u2019s way past time to shut down the whole unconstitutional Education Department.\u201d",

            "author": "Matthew Boyle",
            "content": " With zero legislative accomplishments since retaking the House majority in the 2018 midterm elections,\u00a0 after nearly a year filled with contentious investigations, hearings, and the coming opening of a formal impeachment inquiry, Democrats are betting it all on a quixotic mission to try to take out Trump with impeachment. A problem they face is that they need 218 votes to pass articles of impeachment out of the House, and an even-steeper 67-vote threshold in the U.S. Senate to convict and remove the president from office. At this stage, Democrats do not even have 218 votes despite their 235-seat majority\u2013they are somewhere, at best for the pro-impeachment crowd, somewhere around 175 pro-impeachment votes but with growing momentum. In the Senate, there is next to zero chance that 20 Republicans would join all 47 Democrats to vote to convict Trump on impeachment charges. But Democrats, after failing to take on major legislative issues like infrastructure, healthcare, paid family leave, or anything else for that matter, are now pushing forward with opening official impeachment proceedings against Trump.  Down Range with AWR Hawkins.  Sign up today!  The Democrats spent all year conducting hearings and investigations related to Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, only to fail\u2013as the Special Counsel Robert Mueller probe also failed\u2013to find any evidence of collusion or conspiracy between Trump and his campaign and the Russians. Mueller\u2019s investigation and the Democrat-led investigations also failed to uncover evidence of obstruction of justice by Trump, leaving Democrats empty-handed heading into the August recess back in July. But now, after the emergence of complaints by a supposed \u201cwhistleblower\u201d against Trump with regard to a conversation he had with Ukraine\u2019s newly-elected leader about former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings in the Eastern European NATO ally nation, Democrats have reinvigorated their push for impeachment. They are buoyed by a swelling of support from members in key battleground House districts and renewed energy from top Democrats in leadership, including in particular House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has reportedly told her friends that she views impeachment as inevitable now. It remains unclear exactly what the Democrats would be impeaching Trump for. The content of the supposed \u201cwhistleblower\u201d complaint about Trump\u2019s call with Ukraine\u2019s new president Volodymyr Zelensky remains private, as does the transcript of the call. The president has said he is considering releasing the call transcript, but has not done so yet\u2013and he expressed concerns that releasing a call transcript could produce a chilling effect among world leaders who wish to have honest and frank conversations with the president of the United States. But on Tuesday afternoon, after news broke that Pelosi was moving forward with impeachment, Trump announced via Twitter he has ordered the release of the call transcript in full:   What\u2019s more, the supposed \u201cwhistleblower\u201d technically does not qualify as a whistleblower under the federal law that provides protection to such individuals, despite the media and leftists referring to the person as such, and the person apparently did not even bear witness to the call itself. Even if Trump did what was alleged, it is unclear how that would amount to an illegal act worthy of impeachment and conviction of a U.S. president, as several Republicans like Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) have said. Nonetheless, impeachment is less of a legal question and more of a political matter. Polling shows impeaching Trump remains very unpopular nationwide, and with 31 Democrats sitting in districts in which Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton in 2016\u201313 of which he won by more than six percent\u2013with even more than that filling out a broader ring of vulnerable members nearing 50, Democrats could imperil their chances of holding their majority if they go through with this process. To hit the threshold necessary to impeach Trump\u2013218 votes\u2013Pelosi would need to force several self-portrayed \u201cmoderate\u201d Democrats in these approximately 50 battleground districts to support impeachment by voting for it. That prospect, getting these Democrats who go home to the district and campaign on doing things to help their constituents\u2013to actually vote for anti-Trump craze mania has Republicans nationally salivating. Pelosi has held off the left side of her conference all year on impeachment, arguing it would be a perilous political mission that would endanger Democrats and embolden Trump. But with the rise of the so-called \u201cSquad\u201d led by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), a New York socialist, Pelosi has allowed the growth of these rising leftist forces in her conference all year, to the point where Ocasi0-Cortez has taken the driver\u2019s seat in pushing the party\u2019s agenda, the other side of the Democrat conference be damned. Over the weekend, Ocasio-Cortez ripped Democrats for holding back on impeachment\u2013ginning up the left side of the conference, firing up the Democrat base, and forcing Pelosi into action:   Now that Pelosi has jumped at the behest of the 29-year-old socialist freshman from New York and her fellow \u201cSquad\u201d members Reps. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), Ilhan Omar (D-MN), and Ayanna Pressley (D-MA), Ocasio-Cortez is ripping Pelosi for only doing a committee\u2013saying she wants instead a straight-up impeachment vote.  The complexity of how to structure impeachment proceedings is meaningless in the broader scheme of things politically, Republicans argue, because now in the GOP\u2019s view the Democrat Party\u2013and all of its members\u2013have officially jumped the shark by going for broke on Trump impeachment, facts be damned. Two supposedly \u201cmoderate\u201d New York Democrats who joined the impeachment brigade this week, Reps. Antonio Delgado (D-NY) and Sean Patrick Maloney (D-NY), are already under fire back home in their district as Empire State Republicans hammer away at them for siding with the lunacy of Ocasio-Cortez. New York GOP chairman Nick Langworthy said in a statement: By joining the impeachment mob, Antonio Delgado and Sean Patrick Maloney just abandoned their constituents in favor of AOC and the Squad. The radical left\u2019s endless obsession with trying to take out President Trump and derail his agenda will be rejected by the voters who want their representatives to focus on making their lives better, not their own power. This reckless decision will rightfully go down as the one that cost them their seats. They are hardly alone. Two Virginia Democrat freshman women, Reps. Abigail Spanberger (D-VA) and Elaine Luria (D-VA)\u2013both freshman Democrats representing battleground House districts who co-signed an op-ed with five others nationwide in the Washington Post on Monday evening signaling their openness to impeaching Trump\u2013are under fire in Virginia now for abandoning their constituents in favor of impeachment. \u201cBoth Elaine Luria and Abigail Spanberger were already critically endangered heading into 2020, by publicly joining the left-wing impeachment jihad they are clearly angling for post-Elected office job opportunities,\u201d John Findlay, the executive director of the Virginia Republican Party, told Breitbart News on Tuesday. \u201cThe Republican Party of Virginia already has field staff on the ground this year in preparation for 2020 and will only be expanding our presence as next November approaches.\u201d Another co-signer of their op-ed, Rep. Chrissy Houlahan (D-PA)\u2013a freshman Democrat who represents Pennsylvania\u2019s sixth congressional district, another battleground\u2013is facing criticism already for siding with the radical efforts to impeach Trump while not delivering on substantive policy matters. \u201cRepresentative Chrissy Houlahan has gone Washington as she continues to prove that she cares more about partisan politics than finding solutions to the challenges we face here in Pennsylvania,\u201d John Emmons, a conservative businessman running for the GOP nomination in Pennsylvania\u2019s sixth district for the shot to take on Houlahan next November, told Breitbart News on Tuesday. \u201cShe\u2019d rather go after the President and try to get onto CNN than get to work for the people of her district. The voters of PA-06 deserve so much better out of their Member of Congress.\u201d Rep. Jason Crow (D-CO), a freshman who co-signed the op-ed and represents a battleground district in Colorado after defeating a GOP incumbent in 2018, took a hit in Colorado for signing onto impeachment. \u201cFrom his call for impeachment to his extreme voting record, Jason Crow has put his constituents on the backburner and placed his personal ambitions ahead of the interests of working people,\u201d Colorado GOP spokesman Kyle Kohli told Breitbart News. \u201cColorado\u2019s 6th district won\u2019t forget how Crow sided with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Nancy Pelosi over them.\u201d In Michigan, one of the op-ed\u2019s cosigners, Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-MI), and another fellow freshman Democrat, Rep. Haley Stevens (D-MI),\u00a0 joined the impeachment charade this week as well\u2013and also are paying for it. Michigan GOP chairwoman Laura Cox said in a statement: Today, Elissa Slotkin and Haley Stevens decided to join with Rashida Tlaib, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the most radical members of their party by jumping on the impeachment bandwagon. For nearly three years, Democrats and their allies in the media have conducted a witch-hunt against President Trump in an attempt to undo the results of the 2016 election. Time and time again their accusations have been proven false, and I find it shameful that Slotkin and Stevens have chosen to put their political ambitions ahead of the real issues facing their constituents. These are just a taste of the lines of attack Republicans have ready for the Democrats if they continue wallowing deeper into this mess. The extent to which the impeachment fight, along with other national trends heading into next year\u2019s presidential and congressional elections, could affect the outcome of the 2020 elections could be monstrous. \u201cBy pushing for impeachment, Democrats and their allies in the media are making a major strategic mistake,\u201d Andy Surabian, a GOP strategist and former White House official who advises the president\u2019s son Donald Trump, Jr., told Breitbart News. \u201cThey\u2019re literally walking directly into a buzz saw and don\u2019t even seem to realize it.\u201d What\u2019s more, while they draw attention to the Biden-Ukraine corruption questions, Biden continues slipping in the polls in the Democrat primary. Biden\u2019s team has attempted to frame this battle as a sign that Trump is worried about facing the former Vice President head-to-head, while avoiding answering questions about what he did as Vice President in Ukraine in connection with getting a prosecutor investigating a company on whose board his son served fired in exchange for releasing U.S. taxpayer-funded aid and then bragging about it at a public event. But in reality, the intense scrutiny is waking the country\u2013including many Democrat voters who may not have known much about Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealing in Ukraine or in China or elsewhere and how much of a liability they could be to his father politically. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA)\u2013a leftist socialist rising star on the hard edge of her party far outside the mainstream\u2013has surged past Biden in polling in several states including Iowa, New Hampshire, and California. She is virtually or statistically tied with Biden in a number of national polls as well and has seen her numbers increase even in Biden strongholds like Nevada\u2013leaving South Carolina as basically the only early state refuge for the one-time Democrat frontrunner. If Warren is able to sustain this surge into winning the nomination, while Biden keeps slipping and falling away\u2013all while Trump powers his way through this mess as he has done several times before with other Democrat-driven scandals\u2013the 2020 election could end up becoming a Warren-versus-Trump referendum of socialism-versus-capitalism where the Democrat Party\u2019s new extremist wing takes center stage with no accomplishments to point to since they won the House majority back\u2013all part of why they are going for impeachment in the first place, because they have no other path to beat Trump, some Republicans argue, so they are going for broke with this strategy. \u201cDespite an all-out assault on President Trump, he still has a higher approval rating than Obama did at this point in time,\u201d Steve Guest of the Republican National Committee said. \u201cThis round of baseless calls for impeachment is the Democrats\u2019 acknowledgment of their inability to beat President Trump at the ballot box so they\u2019ll try impeachment instead.\u201d",

Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), is a first-generation American whose parents immigrated from the West Bank, in an area administered by the Palestinian Authority. She represents a district that includes part of Detroit. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) represents parts of Queens and the South Bronx, and traces her roots to Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory. Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) is African-American, and was born to a single mother in Cincinnati and raised in Chicago. The \u201cSquad\u201d is the nickname Pelosi has given the group, which is loosely organized around an organization called the \u201cJustice Democrats,\u201d which seeks to back primary challenges against moderate and white incumbents. Ocasio-Cortez and her chief of staff, Saikat Chakrabarti, have feuded with Pelosi and the Congressional Black Caucus recently. After Ocasio-Cortez suggested Pelosi was racist, President Trump defended the Speaker \u2014 often his nemesis \u2014 on Friday. Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

            "author": "Alexander Marlow, Matthew Boyle, Amanda House, and Charlie Spiering",
            "content": " Trump told Breitbart News in an exclusive lengthy Oval Office interview that Ryan blocked issuance of subpoenas to people he thinks should have been investigated on the political left, and now that the Republicans no longer have the majority in the House, people Trump says Ryan protected may have gotten away with whatever they did that warranted investigation. Trump said that House Freedom Caucus Chairman Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC) and his predecessor and fellow conservative Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) wanted to be tougher with the left, but that Ryan would not let them. \u201cPaul Ryan wouldn\u2019t give the right to have any subpoenas,\u201d Trump told Breitbart News. \u201cOkay? Now in all fairness, Meadows and Jordan and all these guys, they wanted to go tougher, but they weren\u2019t allowed to by leadership.\u201d Trump\u2019s comments came in a wider part of the conversation about how the left is more \u201cvicious\u201d than the right\u2014and that the left in American politics plays \u201ccuter and tougher.\u201d \u201cSo here\u2019s the thing\u2014it\u2019s so terrible what\u2019s happening,\u201d Trump said when asked by Breitbart News Deputy Political Editor Amanda House about his anticipated executive order on campus free speech. \u201cYou know, the left plays a tougher game, it\u2019s very funny. I actually think that the people on the right are tougher, but they don\u2019t play it tougher. Okay? I can tell you I have the support of the police, the support of the military, the support of the Bikers for Trump \u2013 I have the tough people, but they don\u2019t play it tough \u2014 until they go to a certain point, and then it would be very bad, very bad. But the left plays it cuter and tougher. Like with all the nonsense that they do in Congress \u2026 with all this invest[igations]\u2014that\u2019s all they want to do is \u2013you know, they do things that are nasty. Republicans never played this.\u201d Trump\u2019s relationship with Ryan during Ryan\u2019s tenure was fraught with peril from the get-go. Ryan only hesitantly backed Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign in 2016 once Trump won the GOP nomination, but then backed off from supporting Trump after the release of the infamous Access Hollywood tape. Ryan ditched on a campaign event he had scheduled with Trump that weekend, and the following week held a conference call with House GOP members in early October 2016 in which he told members it would be acceptable to him if they abandoned the GOP nominee for president just weeks before the 2016 election. \u201cI am not going to defend Donald Trump\u2014not now, not in the future,\u201d Ryan said on the private call, audio of which was obtained by Breitbart News and published in early 2017. Ryan followed through on that and never campaigned with Trump. When Breitbart News published this audio in the spring of 2017, his then-spokesman Brendan Buck claimed that \u201ca lot has happened since then\u201d and argued that Ryan was working with Trump on the president\u2019s agenda in the first couple years of his administration. With the exception of tax cuts, however, which the president led the way on, Ryan did not deliver much in the way of helping Trump achieve any of his agenda during the time Ryan served as Speaker while Trump served as president. Ryan became speaker in 2015, when then-Speaker John Boehner\u2014facing a revolt from within his own GOP ranks\u2014was forced to step aside. Others had sought the job and failed before Ryan eventually ended up running for the position. Prior to being Speaker, Ryan was the failed 2012 vice presidential nominee for the GOP presidential ticket of former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney. With Ryan at his side, Romney, who has since left Massachusetts behind to move to Utah and now represents Utah in the U.S. Senate, lost the 2012 presidential election to then-President Barack Obama. Then in early 2018, Ryan announced he would not be seeking re-election in the midterms. Critics argued that his not stepping aside hurt the GOP in the midterm elections. Now that Ryan is gone from public life, he took a sharp shot at Trump earlier this week. \u201cThe person who defines that race is going to win the race,\u201d Ryan said about the 2020 presidential race at a lecture in Florida per a local news account. \u201cIf this is about Donald Trump and his personality, he isn\u2019t going to win it.\u201d Trump\u2019s eldest son, Donald Trump, Jr., fired back at Ryan on Twitter earlier in the week, saying the former speaker \u201cfailed\u201d in 2012, \u201clied to us,\u201d did not deliver border wall funding he promised previously, and then went on to lose the House GOP its majority in the midterms.  Ryan has since walked back his criticisms of Trump\u2019s 2020 prospects, saying that he meant to blame the media.   ",

Cook also serves\u00a0as an adviser on the Trump administration\u2019s workforce development initiative. Trump happily discusses his relationship with Cook, which includes phone calls and meetings on tech issues.

As Breitbart News noted: The footage, which ABC News purported was of an attack on the border town of Tal Abyad, was aired Sunday on World News Tonight\u00a0and Good Morning America on Monday morning. However, a\u00a0comparison by Gizmodo shows the video was captured at\u00a0Knob Creek Gun Range in West Point, Kentucky back in 2017. The\u00a0Washington Examiner reported that the video footage had been tweeted by a Turkish politician from Erdogan\u2019s party, in celebration of Turkey\u2019s offensive. That footage remains on Twitter:  However, the footage turn out to be from Kentucky:  The\u00a0Examiner noted that ABC News had taken down its video stories, and issued a correction and apology, but that it had not done so on the air as of Tuesday. At the press conference, Karl \u2014 the network\u2019s chief White House correspondent \u2014 continued, without acknowledging the president\u2019s criticism: \u201c[Senator] Lindsey Graham just said of your remarks that you made in the Oval Office that if you keep talking like that, \u201cthis will be disaster worse than Obama\u2019s decision to leave Iraq.\u201d Trump retorted that \u201cLindsey Graham would like to stay in the Middle East for the next thousand years. \u2026 I want to get out of the Middle East.\u201d He said that Graham should focus on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which he chairs, and ought to focus on the effort by the FBI and the intelligence agencies to monitor his campaign during the 2016 election. \u201cThe people of South Carolina don\u2019t want us to get into a war with Turkey \u2014 a NATO member \u2014 or with Syria. Let them fight their own wars.\u201d He added: \u201cYou should get your accounts correct.

Trump spoke about protecting the First Amendment of free speech, the\u00a0Second Amendment, and rebuilding a strong military and the right to free speech. He criticized Democrats running for president for pursuing radical leftist policies without consideration for the right to religious freedom. \u201cSocialism is obsessed with the pursuit of power because it has replaced religion in their lives,\u201d he said. The president received a standing ovation when he reminded them that America stood for freedom of religion and the right to life. \u201cWe\u2019re under assault, very simple,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIn America, we don\u2019t worship government, we worship God,\u201d Without naming him, Trump referred to former Rep.

Dick Durbin (D-IL). Trump has denied using that term, and Sens. Tom Cotton (R-AR) and Frank Purdue (R-GA) have denied hearing it, as has Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, who was also present. The White House said that President Trump was arguing for a merit-based system of immigration policy, as opposed to the existing policies\u00a0of \u201cchain migration\u201d and the \u201cdiversity visa\u201d lottery. The president\u00a0was also\u00a0reportedly defending his administration\u2019s decision to send some El Salvadorans and Haitians, who are in the U.S. due to earthquake disasters, back to their countries of origin after their temporary protected status expires. Democrats have also used the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday to attack Trump, based on the recent controversy and on past claims that he is a racist. Speculation has mounted whether Romney would be a friend or foe of President Trump if elected to the Senate. Romney has a rocky relationship with President Trump. In March 2016, he\u00a0viciously attacked Trump in a speech in Salt Lake City, Utah \u2014 but stopped short of endorsing a rival candidate in the Republican primary. He mended fences with Trump when he aspired to become Secretary of State in the new administration, but has since re-emerged as one of the president\u2019s leading GOP\u00a0critics, appealing to the remnant of the \u201cNeverTrump\u201d movement. Last summer, Romney criticized President Trump\u2019s response to violence in Charlottesville, accusing him of moral equivalence between neo-Nazis and those opposing \u201cracism and bigotry\u201d \u2014 but without noting that the latter had disrupted a lawful, permitted protest. Democrats accused Romney himself of racism when he ran for president in 2012, particularly when he accused Barack Obama\u00a0supporters of voting for \u201cfree stuff,\u201d and when he joked that \u201cno one\u2019s ever asked to see my birth certificate",

However, Warren did not mention that nearly two-thirds of those deaths were due to suicide, not \u201cgun violence.\u201d In fact, the surge in the gun deaths was the result of a surge in suicides.

            "content": " It was widely\u00a0reported\u00a0Clinton met with several potential 2020 candidates at the beginning of the year, including former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper (D), Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ), and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). However, the failed presidential candidate has been speaking to Warren in recent months,\u00a0according to sources who spoke to NBC News. Sources are not sure how many conversations Warren has had with Clinton, and neither has made obvious attempts to make their conversations nor the nature of them known to the general public. NBC News reports: One source was aware of just one additional call between Warren and Clinton since then. But a person who is close to Clinton said the contact has been substantial enough to merit attention, describing a conversation between the two as seemingly recent because it was \u201cfront of mind\u201d for her. \u201cThat has clearly not gone unnoticed, and I think she really appreciates that,\u201d the person close to Clinton said. It is established both women want President Trump out of the White House, though it is possible that Warren has failed to make her points of contact explicitly known due to the optics, as Clinton \u2013 another female who attempted to break the glass ceiling \u2013 lost handily to Trump in 2016. \u201cTo the extent that Democratic primary voters fear a repeat scenario in 2020 \u2014 and to the extent that she\u2019s competing with Sanders for the votes of progressives \u2014 there may be good reason for Warren to keep her distance from Clinton publicly,\u201d NBC News reports. It notes Clinton could be a valuable asset in the event Warren \u201cfinds herself battling for delegates and superdelegates\u201d at next year\u2019s Democratic National Convention in\u00a0Milwaukee, Wisconsin\u2013 the same state Clinton lost in 2016. \u201cHillary Clinton would absolutely have influence over a number of delegates to this convention,\u201d Deb Kozikowski, the vice chair of the Massachusetts Democratic Party, told NBC News. \u201cIt would be counterproductive for the first woman nominee of the party to not be supportive of a woman who may go over that threshold,\u201d Kozikowski added. According to a Democrat strategist who spoke to NBC News on the condition of anonymity, Clinton admires Warren\u2019s campaign. \u201cShe has applauded her about being serious and disciplined and loves that she is sticking to her guns,\u201d the strategist said. Warren\u2019s team would not provide NBC News with details on Clinton and Warren\u2019s relationship or their conversations, but the outlet admits that the\u00a0duo\u2019s contact \u201cappears to have been more than a courtesy call or a trip to the principal\u2019s office.\u201d",

            "author": "Matthew Boyle",
            "content": " The tracking survey of 4,050 respondents, conducted by Capitol Weekly, has Warren at 24.8 percent in California, while Harris is at 20.3 percent and Biden is at 19.6 percent. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont is at 15.6 percent and South Bend, Indiana, mayor Pete Buttigieg is down at 7.7 percent. The only other candidate to break the 2 percent threshold, at 2.4 percent, is former Rep. Robert Francis \u201cBeto\u201d O\u2019Rourke (D-TX).  The fact that Warren is leading Harris and Biden in California, one of the biggest states in the union and an important early battleground state should the race last longer than just Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina, is particularly important and interesting. It suggests that Harris, who led a different survey out this week in California by one point over Warren, is having difficulty locking up her home state. It also suggests Biden is on the decline in a big way in key Democrat states, and will need to lock in some solid victories ahead of California in states like Iowa or South Carolina if he is to win the nomination. South Carolina polling has had Biden with consistent strong leads over the rest of the field. The previous California survey, from Change Research, had Biden down in fourth place in California at 17 percent, with Harris out in front at 23 percent and Warren right behind her at 22 percent. Sanders came in third in that survey at 20 percent. While Warren is out in front in the new Capitol Weekly poll, there are also some interesting data points when it comes to survey respondents\u2019 second choice\u2013with regard to both Harris and Warren. \u201cWhile the initial vote is the most watched metric, there are underlying measures that can also be extremely valuable to track over time.\u00a0 One of these is the \u2018second choice\u2019 of voters \u2013 those candidates who are consistently viewed as a backup option for voters as their primary choice might falter later in the process,\u201d Capitol Weekly wrote in a piece about the survey data. \u201cOn this metric, we see Harris and Warren consistently at the top of the rankings. Within the CA120 tracking infographic you can actually select any candidate to identify whose voters are likely to support as a second choice. Harris is the second choice of backers of every single candidate in the poll (including the recently exited Congressman Eric Swalwell) except for those who prefer Sanders, whose support goes to Warren as a second choice.\u201d",

            "content": " As Trump suggested Tuesday, Warren appears to have exaggerated the size of her rally crowd in Washington Square on Monday night \u2014 apparently the third time she has done so in recent weeks. Warren\u2019s campaign claimed that 20,000 people had shown up for the event. However, as Breitbart News reported, New York City Parks said that the park did not hold more than 10,000 \u2014 the maximum permitted for the event. Last month, in Minnesota, the Warren campaign claimed that she had drawn a crowd of 12,000 to the campus of\u00a0Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota. But college officials told Breitbart News that the field only had capacity for 3,000, with some \u201cspillover.\u201d Given that the event had been moved outdoors out of concern that the largest indoor hall, at a capacity of 4,000, would be too small, a generous estimate would have put the crowd at 6,000. Nevertheless, many media outlets reported the 12,000 figure, though the only source for that claim was the Warren campaign, and there was no official count from local police, campus officials, or fire marshals. In New Hampshire, the Warren campaign claimed that a crowd of 700 people attended an outdoor town hall event on a farm in Franconia. But Breitbart News \u2014 which was there \u2014 judged the crowd at \u201cover 300,\u201d based on a visual estimate. The pattern appears to be that the Warren campaign claims twice the attendance that can actually be confirmed. There is no doubt that Warren is drawing the largest crowd of any Democratic candidate right now \u2014 certainly larger than frontrunner Joe Biden. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) is also filling halls but has shied away from larger arenas. Warren\u2019s aim appears to be to compare her crowd sizes not with those of her Democratic rivals, but with those of President Donald Trump, who regularly draws numbers in the tens of thousands. The message Warren is sending to Democratic voters is that she will be the most competitive general election candidate against Trump. It is an indirect attack on the \u201celectability\u201d argument that Biden has made to the Democratic Party primary electorate. The media seem eager to oblige her claims \u2014 and they have been caught underestimating Trump\u2019s crowd sizes. Last month, he broke an attendance record at the SNHU Arena in Manchester, New Hampshire, but mainstream outlets ran inaccurate stories about empty seats. But Trump has been known to exaggerate crowd size in the past. In this case, Warren is learning from the master. ",

Should she win the Democrat nomination for president, the last thing she wants is the spectacle of American Indians protesting the fact that for decades, and as a means to advance her academic and political fortunes, The Whitest Woman In The World falsely identified herself as a Cherokee Indian. And this fraud extend through last year, until Warren was 69-years-old. Because it was just last year, in a cynical and audaciously dishonest effort to prove she was indeed a member of Cherokee Nation, Warren lied about the results of her DNA test; a DNA test that actually proved she has no more Native blood than any other white person. In fact, because her genome could range from 1/64 to 1/1024 \u201cNative,\u201d she probably has less. So now, in order to buy off the American Indian, she\u2019s offering billions of our tax dollars for something called the Honoring Promises to Native Nations Act. Worse, in keeping with her tradition of speaking with forked tongue, while appearing before an American Indian advocacy group in Iowa this week, she offered up 1/1024th of an apology for decades and decades of identity fraud and lies. Like anyone who\u2019s been honest with themselves, I know that I have made mistakes. I am sorry for harm I have caused. I have listened and I have learned a lot, and I am grateful for the many conversations we have had together. What is she talking about\u2026? What is she apologizing for\u2026? Does anyone know? I don\u2019t understand the words that are coming out her mouth because she has never once admitted to doing anything wrong\u2026 I this an apology for littering? For filling up her gas tank and taking off? Did she engage in some underage drinking? Did she cheat on her husband, kick a puppy, run with scissors, cheat at Monopoly, shoot a man in Reno just to watch him die? What the hell is she apologizing for\u2026? And how can she apologize when she refuses to admit there has been no wrongdoing? Elizabeth Warren has admitted to NO mistakes, but she thinks she can apologize without admitting to those mistakes, without telling us what those mistakes were. Sorry, no, it doesn\u2019t work that way. Here she is in front of a group of American Indians looking to buy their support, silence, and souls with the apology-equivalent of glass beads. Listen, I am all in favor of second chances, of accepting apologies, of moving on, and if Warren had half a brain in that shrill, neurotic head of hers, she would have used that DNA test as an out, as a way to say, \u201cYou know what, I was wrong. I should not have depended on family lore. I apologize.\u201d But no, instead she counted on the fake news media to shove the lie through, to make it stick, but made the mistake of doing so in an era when that is no longer possible. Hey, 50 years ago the fake news media could convince the public that Ted Kennedy leaving a woman to die was just another \u201cKennedy family tragedy,\u201d but in the reality of today\u2019s New Media, those days are long gone. And now she\u2019s doubling down, obfuscating, dissembling, apologizing while not apologizing, which means nothing has changed. Until last year \u2014 keep that in mind \u2014 until just last year, this whiter than white woman sought to exploit the identity of the American Indian for her own personal gain, and she is still doing it \u2014 still exploiting the Indian; looking to buy them off with empty promises, with a non-apology-apology, with rhetorical trinkets.",

            "subtitle": "Democrat presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has positioned herself as a critic of Silicon Valley and even criticized tech censorship in the recent past \u2014 but now she\u2019s reversed her stance, calling for more policing of lawful speech by the unaccountable Masters of the Universe in Silicon Valley.",
            "author": "Allum Bokhari",
            "content": " In March, Warren called out Facebook for its \u201cability to shut down a debate.\u201d The context was Facebook\u2019s decision to temporarily take down several of her posts that called for the breakup of\u00a0 the tech giant.  The text of her proposal to break up big tech calls for the designation of major tech platforms as \u201cplatform utilities,\u201d that would be required to \u201cmeet a standard of fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory dealing with users\u201d \u2014 if this was meant in good faith, it would mean that users couldn\u2019t be discriminated against on the basis of their political viewpoints or opinions. But Warren doesn\u2019t actually believe that. Far from opposing big tech\u2019s ability to, in her words, \u201cshut down a debate,\u201d she fully supports it \u2014 when the debate has been started by someone she disagrees with. Warren recently called on big tech to crack down on speech she disagrees with, after black Twitter user Ali Alexander questioned whether Kamala Harris, a second-generation Jamaican-Indian, could fully lay claim to the American black identity. Warren today took to Twitter called the insinuation \u201cracist and ugly\u201d and reminded tech companies that they could \u201cstop these vile lies dead in their tracks.\u201d Instead of simply challenging or denouncing the claim in an open marketplace of ideas, Warren went further \u2014 she wants tech companies to exercise greater control over that marketplace, so that rogue ideas can never spread in the first place.  In other words, Warren doesn\u2019t really oppose corporate censorship. Like many of her Democrat colleagues, she simply wants the\u00a0right kind\u00a0of corporate censorship. Are you a source at a Big Tech company or any other corporation who wants to confidentially blow the whistle on wrongdoing or political bias at your company?",

            "subtitle": "FRANCONIA, Grafton County, New Hampshire \u2014 Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) on Wednesday defended her false claim last week that 18-year-old Michael Brown had been \u201cmurdered\u201d by police in Ferguson, Missouri in 2014.",
            "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
            "content": " Speaking to reporters after a town hall event in Franconia, New Hampshire, Warren said that Brown had been unarmed when he was shot \u201cin the middle of the street, by police officers, and left to die.\u201d The 18-year-old Brown, who was unarmed at the time, was shot and killed by police officer Darren Wilson on August 9, 2014. That much is true. However, left-wing activists falsely claimed at the time that Brown was innocent of any crime; had been shot in the back; and had put his hands over his head and said, \u201cDon\u2019t shoot!\u201d (hence the slogan, \u201cHands up, don\u2019t shoot!\u201d). None of those claims turned out to be true \u2014 though they were circulated by Democrats and mainstream journalists. Screenshot / CNN via The Right Scoop The incident revitalized the\u00a0\u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d movement, bringing focus to claims of police brutality \u2014 but also bringing unrest to many American cities, and prompting police to pull back from fighting crime in black neighborhoods. Race relations, according to Gallup polls, suffered a decline from which they have not recovered. The U.S. Department of Justice under President Barack Obama, after an extensive investigation, found evidence that Brown had not been murdered, and that he had probably attacked Wilson first, reaching for his gun (and shooting his own thumb during the scuffle). Brown had also been charging Wilson later when the shots were fired. The Department of Justice concluded that Officer Wilson\u2019s use of force could not be described as \u201cobjectively unreasonable.\u201d It added: \u201cAccordingly \u2026 it is not appropriate to present this matter to a federal grand jury for indictment, and it should therefore be closed without prosecution. \u201d When a local grand jury likewise declined to induct Wilson, a riot ensued, damaging many minority-owned businesses in Ferguson. The neighborhood has struggled ever since. Warren tweeted last Friday:  Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), also running for president, made a similar claim in a tweet of her own on Friday.\u00a0The\u00a0Washington Post\u2018s left-leaning fact-checker awarded Warren and Harris\u2019s claim that Brown was murdered \u201cFour Pinnochios.\u201d In addition, in response to Warren\u2019s tweet, the\u00a0Massachusetts Chiefs of Police Association wrote\u00a0a sharply critical letter, arguing, \u201cYour reckless tweet will only serve to create hatred towards Police Officers and place them in danger of more assaults and perhaps death.\u201d Asked by a reporter for ABC News at a press gaggle after the town hall if she still thought Brown was \u201cmurdered,\u201d Warren refused to retract her claim or to apologize: What happened is that a man was shot \u2014 an unarmed man, in the middle of the street, by police officers, and left to die. And I think that\u2019s where our focus should be. It is the fifth anniversary of that occurring, and we need to talk about how to make real change in this country. I have a more comprehensive plan coming out just a little bit later. Warren, who spoke to a crowd of over 300 in Franconia, is scheduled to continue campaigning in New Hampshire through Wednesday evening.",

Of those surveyed, 31 percent named Warren as their Democrat nominee of choice. Joe Biden (D) came in second place with 25 percent support, followed by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) with 17 percent support. The results demonstrate a five-point gain for Warren, who had 26 percent to Biden\u2019s 25 percent in the YouGovUS/CBS News poll taken August 28 \u2013 September 4, 2019. The remaining candidates fell below the well-established top tier. The survey shows Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) down by double digits, with seven percent support. Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) came in fifth place with five percent support, and former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (D) came in right behind with four percent support. The remaining candidates saw one percent support or less. The margin of error is +/-\u00a01.6 percent:   Warren also saw a boost in individual states. YouGov surveyed 506 registered Democrats in New Hampshire. Thirty-two percent of those respondents chose Warren as their first choice, followed by Biden with 24 percent and Sanders with 17 percent. The margin of error is +/- 5.4 percent:  The survey showed a tighter race in the early caucus state, Iowa. Of the 729 registered Democrats surveyed, 22 percent chose both Warren and Biden. Sanders came in a close third with 21 percent support, followed by Buttigieg with 14 percent support. The margin of error for the Hawkeye State results is +/- 4.6 percent:  Biden, however, continues to hold a strong lead in South Carolina, with 43 percent of the 915 registered Democrats surveyed choosing the former vice president. He topped his closest competitor, Warren, by 25 percent. She garnered 18 percent, followed by Sanders with 16 percent. The margin of error is +/-3.9 percent:  While Biden still holds the greatest electability, he has experienced a ten-point drop in the last month, falling from 77 percent to 67 percent. Warren\u2019s electability, however, has slightly grown, jumping from 55 percent in September to 56 percent in October. Biden and Warren will face each other on the debate stage alongside ten other candidates at\u00a0Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio, on Tuesday evening.",

            "content": " As hard as the media worked to cover and lie for her for over those first 24 hours, the unassailable facts have forced them to throw in the towel. The science is settled: Elizabeth Warren is a fake Indian. Here\u2019s a quick list of the headlines Warren is dealing with today: Washington Post: \u201cElizabeth Warren angers prominent Native Americans with politically fraught DNA test\u201d CNN: \u201cElizabeth Warren might have actually made things worse with her DNA gambit\u201d CBS News: \u201cElizabeth Warren criticized for releasing DNA report\u201d Politico (Politico!): \u201cWarren stumbles with \u2018Native American\u2019 rollout\u201d HuffPost: \u201cWhy White Americans Love To Claim Native Ancestry\u201d The Hill: \u201cDem strategist says Warren taking DNA test was \u2018tone deaf'\u201d New York Times: Elizabeth Warren\u2019s DNA Results Draw Rebuke from Trump and Raise Questions USA Today: \u201cCherokee Nation slams Sen. Elizabeth Warren DNA test as \u2018inappropriate and wrong'\u201d Boston Globe: Elizabeth Warren Defends Decision to Release DNA Test Compare those headlines to the headlines Monday morning when Warren rolled out her carefully planned assault on Trump using her DNA results. Keep in mind that part of Team Warren\u2019s careful planning involved alerting the media beforehand. This allowed every establishment media outlet to coordinate and execute a plan that would spin this into vindication and a big victory for Warren over Trump. Remember, our establishment media is the communication arm of the Democrat Party, so all of them got the talking points ahead of time and tried diligently to stick to them. All of this is painfully obvious in these Monday morning headlines: ABC News: \u201cElizabeth Warren reveals proof of Native American ancestry\u201d AP: \u201cWarren DNA shows Native American heritage\u201d CNN: \u201cElizabeth Warren releases DNA test with \u2018strong evidence\u2019 of Native American ancestry\u201d BBC: \u201cElizabeth Warren: DNA test finds \u2018strong evidence\u2019 of Native American blood\u201d USA Today: \u201cWarren DNA shows Native American heritage\u201d NBC News: \u201cElizabeth Warren releases DNA results indicating she has Native American heritage\u201d Boston Globe: \u201cWarren Reveals test Confirming Ancestry\u201d Here is my favorite flip-flop\u2026 The far-left Daily Beast on Monday: \u201cBREAKING: Elizabeth Warren releases her DNA test: Yes, she is Native American\u201d The far-left Daily Beast on Wednesday: \u201cElizabeth Warren\u2019s DNA Stunt Alienates Native Americans\u201d Try to imagine Warren on Sunday night. Picture her so excited she cannot sleep, excited because she has planned this out like the invasion of Normandy. She\u2019s got the DNA test proving she might only be 1023/1024 white. She has a slick video that will own Drumpf. She has the establishment media all lined up to do her bidding. The Boston Globe has even agreed to botch the math in her favor. So there she is, lying in the dark grinning, rubbing her hands together, because she can see 2020 from her wigwam. Better still, in her mind\u2019s eye she can see President Trump on defense for days as the media pummel him as an Indian giver over his $1 million bet. Oh, yes, at long last someone will get the best of Drumpf, and it will be me! Me, I tell you! ME! And I will leap to the top of the presidential polls, and destroy Trump in 2020, and be the first woman president and the first Cherokee president and redistribute the wampum and, and, and\u2026 In the immortal words of Bugs Bunny: \u201cSheesh, what a maroon.\u201d Let me tell you the mistake Warren made. Oh, yes, she made quite a few, but here is the Big One \u2013the only one that mattered\u2026 Warren believes she still lives in a world where the establishment media can set the narrative. There is no other explanation for this fiasco. She actually thought that if she lined up the dinosaurs \u2014 the\u00a0Boston Globe, CNN, the New York Times, the Washington Post and the rest \u2014 that she could magically get away with passing her junk science off as proof she is not a godless liar. Ten years ago, she probably would have gotten away with it. Today? No way. New Media is just too good at what we do. And it certainly helps when we have the facts on our side, and in the case of Warren\u2019s DNA test, the facts are not only devastating to Warren, they are fatal to her 2020 presidential aspirations. The truth is that Warren\u2019s DNA test \u2014 just like all the documentary evidence of the past \u2014 only proved Warren a liar, a liar with no more Native blood in her than the average white American. She might even have less. And even that is not exactly true because \u2014 get this \u2014 her DNA test did not even use American Indian samples. The samples came from Peru, Mexico, and Colombia. Sure, back in \u201908, just as the media was able to shoot down Barack Obama known associations with racists and domestic terrorists, just as they were able to wrist flick his illegal drug use, they might have been able to put this controversy to bed for Warren \u2014 to declare it old and settled news. But it is not 2008 anymore, and if Warren is incapable of grasping that simple fact, she has no business running for president.sssss",

Warren is not the first 2020 presidential candidate to call for reparations. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) announced in a Monday radio interview with New York City\u2019s Power 105.1\u2019s \u201cThe Breakfast Club\u201d that \u201csome type of\u201d reparations should be provided to black Americans impacted by slavery.

Bernie Sanders (I-VT), former 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, have not expressed support for this policy. Warren has received a lot of pushback on the campaign trail for her exaggerated claims of Native American ancestry. One heckler at Warren\u2019s campaign rally in Georgia on Saturday yelled, \u201cWhy did you lie?\u201d and held up a \u201c1/2020th\u201d sign before being escorted out of the campaign event. The Massachusetts Democrat released results of a 2018 DNA test which\u00a0revealed\u00a0that she had between 1/64th and 1/1,1024th Native American ancestry after President Donald Trump and other Republicans criticized her for falsely claiming Native American ancestry. Trump has frequently called Warren \u201cPocahontas,\u201d most recently\u00a0using\u00a0the term to refer to Warren after she launched her bid for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination this month. The Massachusetts Democrat\u00a0issued\u00a0an apology in January to the Cherokee Nation for taking the DNA test shortly after the results of the DNA test went public because Cherokee leaders thought modern DNA tests undermined centuries-old laws and traditions defining tribal heritage.",

            "content": "  The painful exchange began with\u00a0Charlamagne tha God asking Warren if she regretted taking the DNA test which revealed her genes only show evidence of 1/64 to 1/1024 Native American heritage. \u201cOh, I can\u2019t go back,\u201d Warren began. \u201cI grew up in Oklahoma, I learned about my family the same way most people learn about there family, from there my momma, from my daddy, aunts and my uncles. And it\u2019s what I believed.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not a person of color,\u201d she then conceded. \u201cI\u2019m not a citizen of a tribe and I shouldn\u2019t have done it.\u201d Charlamagne, interrupting Warren, then asked if she would claim Native American heritage again if she could do it again. \u201cI can\u2019t go back,\u201d Warren repeated. \u201cBut, I shouldn\u2019t. But what I do is try to be a good partner. And that\u2019s what I do every day.\u201d Warren went on to name drop issues such as health care, student loan debt, and the housing crisis. However, the Breakfast Club hosts were unfazed by Warren\u2019s attempt to pivot away from the controversial subject and continued to press her. \u201cSo what? Your family told you were Native American,\u201d\u00a0DJ Envy asked. \u201cYeah!\u201d Warren exclaimed. \u201cHow long did you hold on to that?\u201d\u00a0Charlamagne asked. \u201cBecause there were some reports that said you were Native American on your Texas Bar license and that you said you were Native American, also documents when you were a professor at Harvard\u2013like, why did you do that?\u201d Warren repeated her initiation response, claiming that she learned of her now-debunked lineage from her family. She failed to provide any date and time on when exactly she found out about her true heritage. Charlamagne\u2019s next, key question went entirely unanswered: \u201cWhen did you find out you weren\u2019t?\u201d Warren sputtered, then replied: \u201cI\u2019m not a person of color. I\u2019m not a citizen of a tribe and tribal citizenship is an important distinction, and not something I am. So\u2026\u201d She left that final sentence unfinished, waiting for another question. \u201cWas there any benefits to that?\u201d\u00a0Charlamagne tha God shot back. \u201cNo,\u201d she said, finding her footing again in a prepared line. \u201cBoston Globe did a full investigation, it never affected anything about my family. It never affected any job I ever got.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like the original Rachel\u00a0Dolezal a little bit,\u201d\u00a0Charlamagne quipped. \u201cRachel\u00a0Dolezal is a white woman pretending to be black.\u201d \u201cWell, this is what I learned from my family,\u201d Warren replied, throwing her hands up.",

She wants to raise that tax to 30 percent while increasing the tax on ammunition to 50 percent. Because excise taxes are paid directly by the consumer\u2013the taxes are added to the price of the goods\u2013this means a $500 gun would immediately cost $650 and the price for a $20 box of ammo would immediately rise to $30. Warren claims this taxation policy would \u201cbring in new federal revenue\u201d that can used for \u201cgun violence prevention.\u201d And she simultaneously suggests the tax would raise the price on guns and ammo to a level sufficient to stifle sales. She does not explain how reducing sales via tax policy can bring in new revenue. Rather, she cites\u201dfederal excise tax on cigarettes, domestic wine, or even airline tickets,\u201d to try to bolster justify pushing for more taxes on firearms and bullets. Down Range with AWR Hawkins.  Sign up today! Ironically, Warren also wants government-imposed limits on the number of guns Americans can purchase. This would cut sales as well, further reducing tax revenue. ",

It\u2019s a danger to the air we breathe. It causes earthquakes. It\u2019s highly explosive. Safe fracking is, like clean coal, pure fiction,\u201d Sanders said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cBut, most importantly, methane from natural gas contributes to climate change and is setting us on a path to disaster,\u201d he added. \u201cWhen we are in the White House, we will end the era of fossil fuels, and that includes fracking\u201d:  Ten Democrat candidates participated in CNN\u2019s seven-hour climate change town hall Wednesday, and many\u00a0signaled support for the implementation of a carbon tax as well as plastic straw bans, actions on meat consumption, and the end of fracking. \u201cThere\u2019s no question I\u2019m in favor of banning fracking,\u201d Sen.

This is something I\u2019ve taken on in California, I have a history of working on this issue,\u201d she added. Sen.

            "author": "Hannah Bleau",
            "content": " While the presidential candidate hit a number of issues during the broad discussion, Section 1325 of the immigration code, which makes it a criminal offense for people to cross the border illegally, became a highlight. \u201cAre you in favor of repealing that?\u201d she was asked. \u201cI am,\u201d Warren said, arguing that \u201ccriminalizing\u201d illegal entry does not make people safer. \u201cI think that the whole notion of criminalizing the approach to coming across the border without documentation is not making anybody any safer. We just need to be in a different position on this,\u201d she said, downplaying the number of criminals and drug traffickers who take advantage of the porous border. \u201cIt\u2019s really important on immigration that we concentrate our resources on the people who pose threats to us, and that\u2019s not children,\u201d she continued. \u201cIt\u2019s not mamas fleeing terror from gangs down in Central America. It\u2019s not people trying to build a life who have family here,\u201d she added:  Recent\u00a0U.S. Customs and Border Protection data revealed that two caravans that arrived at the U.S.-Mexico border, in October 2018 and January 2019,\u00a0included \u201c1,520 previously deported illegal aliens who had been convicted of crimes in the U.S.,\u201d Breitbart News reported. Of those: That data only reflects the illegal aliens from those two caravans alone. There are countless stories of illegal alien crime, although many of the stories are largely ignored by the establishment media. In January,\u00a0U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrested more than 100 immigration violators in New York. The vast majority of the illegal aliens were convicted criminals. Breitbart News reported:  U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) made 188 arrests from January 14-18. Of those arrested, 107 were convicted criminals or facing charges, and 55 failed to leave the country after a final order of removal or were previously removed and returned to the U.S. The following month, a story emerged of an illegal alien mother of nine, Celia Ruiz-Ochoa, who ran a massive drug trafficking ring after settling in the states and passed it down to her son in 2016. She is serving 17 years in federal prison: Federal authorities say Ruiz-Ochoa often trafficked the\u00a0drugs into the U.S. by air and by land. She was so successful that\u00a0she rose to the top of an international drug trafficking ring which contributed to the opioid crisis in Ohio, WCPO\u00a0reported\u00a0Thursday. Additionally, the majority of\u00a0working-class Americans say current immigration policies are driving up crime in the U.S. Breitbart News reported:  The latest Gallup survey finds that among Americans with less than a college degree, more than one-in-two, or 51 percent, said immigration to the U.S. has made crime across the country worse. About 41 percent said immigration has not had much impact on crime, and only seven percent said immigration has decreased crime. Overall, more Americans say immigration is driving up crime than those who say immigration is decreasing crime. About 42 percent of Americans said immigration makes crime worse, while about 50 percent said immigration has no impact on crime. Only seven percent of Americans believe immigration decreases crime. The \u201ccriminal offense\u201d topic bubbled up during the recent Democrat debate, with former HUD Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro (D) hitting Beto O\u2019Rourke (D) over his purported support of\u00a0Section 1325. \u201cLet\u2019s be very clear. The reason that they\u2019re separating these little children from their families is that they\u2019re using Section 1325 of that act, which criminalizes coming across the border to incarcerate the parents and then separate them,\u201d Castro said on the debate stage. \u201cSome of us on this stage have called to end that section, to terminate it. Some, like Congressman O\u2019Rourke, have not,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd I want to challenge all of the candidates to do that.\u201d Voters can add Warren \u2013 a top tier Democrat candidate \u2013 to the list of candidates who support decriminalizing illegal entry into the United States.

            "author": "Hannah Bleau",
            "content": " Warren argues that \u201cjustice\u201d plays a massive role in properly addressing the climate change \u201ccrisis,\u201d citing studies that suggest that black and Hispanic families are disproportionately affected by air pollution caused by white people: A more recent study found that while whites largely cause air pollution, Blacks and Latinxs are more likely to breathe it in. Unsurprisingly, these groups also experience higher rates of childhood asthma. And many more low-income and minority communities are exposed to toxins in their water \u2013 including lead and chemicals from industrial and agricultural run-off. Warren calls this phenomenon \u201cenvironmental racism\u201d and concludes that \u201cenvironmental injustice is the result of decades of discrimination and environmental racism compounding in communities that have been overlooked for too long.\u201d She previewed her plan in a video clip featuring far-left \u201cSquad\u201d member Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI). \u201cWe need a government that\u2019s on the side of families\u2014not giant corporations polluting our communities. @RashidaTlaib and I walked through 48217, the most polluted zip code in Michigan, and talked with the families living every day with the effects of pollution,\u201d Warren tweeted alongside the clip:  Like Warren\u2019s other proposals, her environmental injustice plan weaves in aspects of her other campaign promises. For instance, Warren says her housing plan will provide an assistance program, aimed to get impoverished families out of poor, pollution-ridden neighborhoods and into the \u201cneighborhood of their choice.\u201d She also pledges to invest one-third \u2013 or $1 trillion\u00a0\u2013 of her climate change investment \u201cinto the most vulnerable communities,\u201d although she does not specify what the $1 trillion will be spent on, specifically. Like most of Warren\u2019s plans, her environmental injustice proposal involves the implementation of another tax. In this instance, it is the \u201cSuperfund Waste Tax.\u201d Her plan states: There are over 1300 remaining Superfund sites across the country, many located in or adjacent to frontline communities. So-called \u201corphan\u201d toxic waste clean-ups were originally funded by a series of excise taxes on the petroleum and chemical industries. But thanks to Big Oil and other industry lobbyists, when that tax authority expired in 1995 it was not renewed. Polluters must pay for the consequences of their actions \u2013 not leave them for the communities to clean up. I\u2019ll work with Congress to reinstate and then triple the Superfund tax, generating needed revenue to clean up the mess. The presidential hopeful even weaves in Medicare for All as part of her broader proposal, arguing such a system will \u201cmake it easier for the federal government to quickly tailor health care responses to specific environmental disasters in affected communities when they occur.\u201d Warren also reiterates her pledge to \u201censure that employers and our government honor the promises they made to workers in fossil fuel industries.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve fought for years to protect pensions and health benefits for retired coal workers, and I\u2019ll continue fighting to maintain the solvency of multi-employer pension plans,\u201d she said. \u201cAs president, I\u2019ll protect those benefits that fossil fuel workers have earned.\u201d However, Warren\u2019s role in crafting a petition to the Supreme Court on behalf of LTV Steel \u2013 which helped the company\u2019s \u201cfight against a congressional requirement\u00a0 that it pay millions of dollars into a fund for its retired coal miners\u2019 health care\u201d \u2013\u00a0calls her promise into question. \u201cAs I\u2019ve traveled this country, I\u2019ve heard the human stories from frontline communities. Families where many people have cancer. Coastal communities facing the threat of rising sea levels. Ruined land and poisoned water,\u201d Warren tweeted. \u201cThese communities need justice\u2014and I will stand with them,\u201d she added:    ",

She boycotted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s address to Congress in 2015, and accused Netanyahu of corruption and \u201cembracing right-wing extremism\u201d earlier this year. An activist from the radical left-wing group IfNotNow named Becca Lubow approached Warren in New Hampshire on Monday after a town hall and asked Warren if she would commit to pushing \u201cthe Israeli government to end Occupation.\u201d Warren answered, \u201cYes. Yes. So I\u2019m there.\u201d  In a statement, IfNotNow described, and applauded, what it described as Warren\u2019s increasingly \u201cprogressive\u201d stance on Israel:  The word \u201coccupation\u201d was not defined. Some anti-Israel activists consider the very existence of Israel to be an \u201coccupation.\u201d IfNotNow is a fringe group that began in the midst of Israel\u2019s war against the Palestinian terror group Hamas in 2014 \u2014 a war for which Hamas was almost universally blamed, and in which Hamas fired rockets at civilian population centers. As Breitbart News noted earlier this year (original links): IfNotNow seeks to disrupt the connections that many American Jewish organizations have with Israel. It blames American Jewish support for Israel for the persistence of the Israeli occupation of Judea and Samaria (the West Bank), though most Palestinians in that territory live under the administration of the Palestinian Authority. In addition to staging sit-ins and protests, members of IfNotNow attempt to infiltrate Jewish summer camps and tours of Israel, where they launch demonstrations or expose the mainstream Jewish community to anti-Israel propaganda. In one episode in 2018, members of IfNotNow were arrested while reciting the Kaddish \u2014 the traditional Jewish prayer for the dead \u2014 near the offices of the Jewish Federation of Greater Los Angeles, memorializing Palestinians killed in \u201cprotests\u201d at the Gaza border. (The vast majority of Palestinians killed were members of Hamas, and they were trying to infiltrate Israel to carry out attacks, not stage a non-violent protest against Israeli policies.) Recently, IfNotNow supported Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) after she repeatedly used antisemitic rhetoric.",

            "content": " The DC Council approved of the \u201cIndigenous Peoples\u2019 Day Emergency Declaration Act of 2019\u201d last week, which temporarily replaces Columbus Day with \u201cIndigenous Peoples\u2019 Day\u201d in the city this year. However, it is not a permanent measure:  Council member David Grosso said last week: \u201cColumbus Day was officially designated as a federal holiday in 1937, despite the fact Columbus did not discover North America, despite the fact millions of people were already living in North America upon his arrival to the Americas, and despite the fact Columbus never set foot on the shores of the current United States. \u2026 Columbus enslaved, colonized, mutilated, and massacred thousands of Indigenous People in the Americas. Warren, who falsely claimed Native American heritage throughout her academic career, embraced the temporary replacement. \u201cThe story of America\u2019s mistreatment of indigenous peoples is long and painful. And yet, Native communities have proven resilient,\u201d Warren wrote. \u201cWe owe them our respect\u2014and we must honor our government\u2019s commitments and promises to them,\u201d she added with the hashtag, \u201c#IndigenousPeoplesDay\u201d:  Warren also\u00a0provided a link to her extensive plan focused on \u201chonoring and empowering tribal nations and Indigenous peoples\u201d:  The presidential hopeful unveiled her comprehensive plan to \u201cempower\u201d tribal nations in August, which included key pieces from her other plans. She promised to expand federally protected land, sign a \u201cset of executive orders to hold private contractors accountable for pay equity,\u201d and provide Medicare for All. Warren has faced scrutiny for falsely claiming Native American heritage in the past. The results of her DNA test made public last year showed that she possessed between 1/64th and 1/1,024 Native American ancestry (or between 0.1 percent to 1.56 percent). The results called her past claims of Native American heritage \u2013 Cherokee heritage, specifically \u2013 into question. Not only had Warren identified as a minority professor for years, she also claimed Native American\u00a0heritage on her\u00a0Texas Bar registration card and once cited her high cheekbones as proof of her native roots. A clip of an interview from 2012 shows the presidential hopeful telling a reporter that she had pictures proving her Native American family history, but she refused to show them. \u201cI have plenty of pictures. They\u2019re not for you,\u201d Warren told the reporter:  As Breitbart News reported, Warren\u2019s DNA results did not show a direct association with Native American tribes in the U.S., further debunking her claims of Cherokee heritage. Warren has failed to explain why she went so many years claiming minority status without checking her family history, but she has since admitted that she is \u201cnot a citizen of a tribe\u201d and issued a general\u00a0apology for making what she described as a \u201cmistake.\u201d \u201cLike anyone who\u2019s been honest with themselves, I know that I have made mistakes,\u201d Warren\u00a0said\u00a0at the Native American Presidential Forum in Sioux City, Iowa, in August. \u201cI am sorry for harm I have caused.\u201d Warren will join 11 other candidates on the debate stage at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio, on Tuesday evening. The Massachusetts senator\u2019s false claims of Native American heritage have yet to become a topic of conversation at any of the primary debates.",

            "content": " As Breitbart News noted Sunday, Warren\u2019s campaign tale was called into question by a 2007 interview in which she suggested she left for lack of qualifications and interest. County records published by the Washington Free Beacon on Monday confirm that Warren resigned and was never fired. The Free Beacon\u2019s Collin Anderson reported: RIVERDALE, N.J.\u2014The Riverdale Board of Education approved a\u00a0second-year teaching contract\u00a0for a young Elizabeth Warren, documents show, contradicting the Democratic presidential candidate\u2019s repeated claims that she was asked not to return to teaching\u00a0after a\u00a0single\u00a0year because she was \u201cvisibly pregnant.\u201d Minutes of an April 21, 1971, Riverdale Board of Education meeting obtained by the Washington Free Beacon show that\u00a0the board voted unanimously on a motion to extend Warren a \u201c2nd year\u201d contract for a two-days-per-week teaching job. That job is similar to the one she held the previous year, her first year of teaching. Minutes from a board meeting held two months later, on June 16, 1971, indicate that Warren\u2019s resignation was \u201caccepted with regret.\u201d In fact, the minutes show that far from being fired, Warren had been unanimously approved for a second year:  The minutes also confirm a key detail from the 2007 interview: namely, that Warren was hired on an \u201cemergency\u201d basis because she lacked the necessary education qualifications, despite graduating from George Washington University with a degree in speech pathology, and supposedly pursuing a lifelong dream of being a public school teacher. In the course of her presidential campaign, Warren has repeatedly told the nation a very different story \u2014 one in which an old-fashioned male principal discriminated against her because of her pregnancy. In the second presidential debate in Detroit, for example, Warren said: \u201c[A]t the end of that first year, I was visibly pregnant. And back in the day, that meant that the principal said to me \u2014 wished me luck and hired someone else for the job.",

Hate has no place in America\u201d:  While it is true that the El Paso gunman allegedly posted an anti-immigration manifesto filled with bigoted vitriol, the writer said his twisted thoughts predated Trump. The Dayton shooter, on the other hand, was an avowed leftist who seemingly supported Antifa and held anti-ICE, anti-police, and anti-Second Amendment views, according to a Twitter account linked to the gunman. He also had a liking for Warren herself, writing in one tweet that he would \u201chappily\u201d vote for the Massachusetts senator. Warren has not delved into the Dayton shooter\u2019s purported support for her.\u00a0Rather, the mainstream media have rallied behind her, urging critics to refrain from implicating Warren. Warren is not the only candidate to dismiss Trump\u2019s swift condemnation. Fellow 2020 candidates pounced following his remarks, continuing to accuse him of fostering a negative environment conducive to white supremacy:    ",

And yes, a famous geneticist analyzed my DNA and concluded that it contains Native American ancestry.\u00a0pic.twitter.com/r3SNzP22f8 \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren)\u00a0October 15, 2018    The DNA results did not bode well for Warren, despite her initial victory lap. The results showed that she possessed between\u00a01/64th and 1/1024th Native American ancestry, or\u00a0between 0.1 percent to 1.56 percent. Additionally, the results indicated that Warren\u2019s minuscule Native American links were not associated with tribes in the United States, further casting doubt on her claims of Cherokee heritage. President Trump pounced on the results. \u201cPocahontas (the bad version), sometimes referred to as Elizabeth Warren, is getting slammed,\u201d he wrote on October 16, 2018. \u201cShe took a bogus DNA test and it showed that she may be 1/1024, far less than the average American. Now Cherokee Nation denies her, \u2018DNA test is useless.\u2019 Even they don\u2019t want her. Phony!\u201d he added:  \u201cA DNA test is useless to determine tribal citizenship,\u201d Cherokee Nation Secretary of State Chuck Hoskin Jr. said. \u201cCurrent DNA tests do not even distinguish whether a person\u2019s ancestors were indigenous to North or South America\u201d: Using a DNA test to lay claim to any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any tribal nation, even vaguely, is inappropriate and wrong. It makes a mockery out of DNA tests and its legitimate uses while also dishonoring legitimate tribal governments and their citizens, whose ancestors are well documented and whose heritage is prove. Senator Warren is undermining tribal interests with her continued claims of tribal heritage. The results followed Warren\u2019s years of false Native American claims. She listed herself as a minority professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School and Harvard Law School and claimed Native American\u00a0heritage on her\u00a0Texas Bar registration card. She continued to tout false claims of Native American heritage into her 2012 senatorial bid, telling a reporter that she had pictures that reflected her Native American heritage but added, \u201cI have plenty of pictures. They\u2019re not for you,\u201d leaving the purported evidence shrouded in mystery:  That same year, Warren told the story of her parents, claiming that her father\u2019s parent\u2019s disapproved of her mother because she \u2013 as Warren claimed \u2013 was part Cherokee and Delaware. \u201cIf your family heritage had an African American like you have, the grandfather or great grandparent who was a Cherokee, would you call yourself a black, and expect African Americans to accept that?\u201d New England Cable News\u2019s Jim Braude asked Warren. \u201cIf that same ancestor was black and not Cherokee,\u201d he added. \u201cIf my Father\u2019s parents had said, \u2018You can\u2019t marry her because she\u2019s black, and that had been part of our family growing up, that we had two different families?\u201d Warren said. \u201cYou would be comfortable with saying you\u2019re black?\u201d Braude asked. \u201cIt would be part of identification,\u201d Warren quipped:  While Warren has failed to offer an explicit and thorough explanation for her years of misleading claims, she has vaguely apologized for making a \u201cmistake\u201d and admitted that she is \u201cnot a person of color\u201d and \u201cnot a citizen of a tribe.\u201d \u201cLike anyone who\u2019s been honest with themselves, I know that I have made mistakes,\u201d Warren said at the Native American Presidential Forum in Sioux City, Iowa, in August. \u201cI am sorry for harm I have caused\u201d:  Warren\u2019s campaign deleted the results of her DNA test from her campaign website in August.",

This figure is made even more embarrassing by the fact that as the date of the event neared, the venue was not able to give tickets away at just $6.55 each. Ticket prices started between $200 and $53 Canadian. On top of that, in the middle of the event, Hillary had one of her famous coughing fits, which was caught on video.  While the aging Clintons spent much of the night bashing President Trump, they did so in front of a nearly empty room that proves just how out of touch they have both become. The belief they could fill a hockey arena is the worst kind of vanity. Had the event taken place at a smaller venue, the Clintons\u2019 diminishing appeal would not have been quite so obvious. Meanwhile, Hillary\u2019s nemesis, one Donald Trump, continues to draw crowds who wait in line all day and then fill arenas up to the rafters. The Clinton tour is promoted by Live Nation and promoted as a one-of-a-kind conversation with a former president and secretary of state.

You seem like a very nice person,\u201d do people really want to leave their homes and spend good money to watch what appears to be just another cable news segment? As the American Thinker points out, \u201cWhile 3300 tickets sold at prices ranging from $53 to over $200 still yields a healthy payday, even after expenses, the optics are terrible,\u201d which is something even the far-left CNN is pointing out. \u201cI just think the optics of going to an event where people are paying to see them, and they are financially gaining from this, I am not sure that is the right way to reingratiate them back into the public sphere,\u201d said a former Clinton aide. \u201cThey haven\u2019t gone away, and I don\u2019t want them to go away, but I am not sure this is the right venue from an optics standpoint.\u201d The Toronto Star\u2019s review of the night earned the headline, \u201cHillary and Bill Just Won\u2019t Go Away.\u201d If this were a free tour, or a tour where all the profits went to charity, the optics would be much better. As it is, especially when you remember the Clintons are already worth hundreds of millions of dollars, it looks like just another cynical cash grab for two people who already have more money than they could ever hope to spend.

            "content": " One key to stopping this long international nightmare of Islamic terrorism will be reminding American voters every single day between now and November that the foreign policy decisions of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton caused the rise of ISIS. The history is very clear. When Barack Obama took office in 2008 with Hillary Clinton as his Secretary of State, one of his first moves on foreign policy was his New Beginning speech in Cairo, Egypt. With members of the Muslim Brotherhood in attendance, Pres. Obama claimed a new era had begun in America\u2019s attitude toward Islam. What followed was the \u201cArab Spring\u201d uprisings throughout the region. Even though people initially hailed these as bold moves by people desperate for freedom, the \u201cArab Spring\u201d was, in fact, a way for Islamists to dethrone the region\u2019s more secular military dictators. Cairo itself made this clear: just months after Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton declared a new beginning, rebels removed Hosni Mubarak from office, and the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood came to power and installed brutal sharia law. The single biggest factor that led to the rise of ISIS was the failed attempt to overthrow Syrian Pres. Bashar al-Assad. The United States openly called for the overthrow of Assad, even though it was clear that the result of that overthrow would be Islamist groups taking over. Syria proved to be resistant to the Obama/Clinton calls for regime change. Instead of the quick overthrow that happened in Egypt, Assad, aided by the Russians and opposed by the U.S., held on \u2013 even as the United States was giving weapons to the so-called \u201crebels\u201d that would eventually find their way into the hands of Islamist groups. This power vacuum in Syria created the conditions for ISIS to rise. In Iraq, the continued withdrawals that happened under Hillary Clinton\u2019s watch created another power vacuum that led to ISIS gaining more land and resources. This interview, which I did with Clare Lopez from the Center for Security Policy,\u00a0gives even more detail \u2014\u00a0in just five minutes. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1eziEBvzbOU The mainstream media has done nothing to explain this to the American people. However, simply complaining about the mainstream media is not enough. The stakes are too high to let mere grumbling suffice. No, what needs to happen is that the Donald Trump campaign and the Republican Party need to realize that the ball is in their court when it comes to bringing Americans the truth. Trump, his surrogates, his supporters, and every single Republican politician needs to take this responsibility seriously and lay out a factual case for the American people, as often as possible. The real danger here is that Republicans are so used to losing the public relations battle that they give it up before it even starts. After years of being battered by the institutional left media complex, Republicans are too used to cowering and surrendering. There needs to be an immediate commitment to clear-eyed truth-telling by the GOP\u2026 otherwise, America is in for four years of Clinton once again setting foreign policy.",

            "content": " The former Secretary of State spoke at an event at Georgetown University and said she had spoken to \u201cmany\u201d of the 2020 Democrat presidential candidates and left each of them with an ominous warning. \u201cYou can run the best campaign, you can have the best plans, you can get the nomination, you can win the popular vote, and you can lose the electoral college and therefore the election,\u201d she warned. Clinton said she told every candidate that they would get their emails hacked, referring to her campaign manager John Podesta who fell for a phishing attempt to get access to his private Gmail address. \u201cIf you have not had your personal and campaign emails hacked, they will be,\u201d she warned, adding that the information would be \u201cstolen and weaponized against you in the most pernicious ways.\u201d \u201cRemember Pizzagate? WikiLeaks?\u201d she added wryly, referring to the \u201chorrible kinds of outcomes we saw before when people believed pizzagate.\u201d She demanded the press and the public immediately discredit weaponized hacked information in future elections. Clinton also warned of \u201cphony false online news stories\u201d that migrated to the \u201cso-called mainstream media.\u201d She pointed to the \u201cso-called deep-fake\u201d videos online such as the one of Nancy Pelosi appearing drunk in a video that Facebook declined to take down, as they believed social media users could decide for themselves whether it was true or not. \u201cHow can you decide for yourself when what is presented is blatantly false and manufactured?\u201d she asked with exasperation. Trump and some online media outlets, she insisted, were creating a crisis in the United States. \u201cRacist and white supremacist views are lifted up in the media and in the White House,\u201d she said. She warned of \u201cdisturbing\u201d efforts by the president\u2019s campaign to distribute \u201cpropaganda\u201d on social media. \u201cThe Trump campaign is already spending hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars on Facebook each week to spread fake endorsements and outright lies about the Democrats,\u201d she said. Clinton cited \u201cvoter suppression\u201d in the 2018 midterm elections where Stacy Abrams \u201cshould be the governor\u201d of Georgia and Andrew Gillum lost his race for Florida Governor because the election \u201cneither free nor fair, and certainly not transparent.\u201d She cited a study from 2016, noting that anywhere between 27,000 to 200,000 Wisconsin voters were turned away from the polls on election day for having incorrect voting information, suggesting that\u2019s why she lost in 2016. Clinton also claimed that the suppression of the black vote was also part of the reason she lost. \u201cI was the first person who ran for president in more than 50 years without the protection of the Voting Rights act and let me tell you, it makes a difference.\u201d She also brought up a case where Russians had accessed two online voting systems in Florida, as evidence that foreign powers could directly change voting tallies in the state. \u201cThink about that. A direct assault by a foreign advisory on a state\u2019s election system and citizens of that state and our country can\u2019t know about it?\u201d she asked. Clinton said the reports she mentioned were only the \u201cbare minimum\u201d of what really happened in the election, citing the Mueller report as evidence of widespread Russian interference in the election. She theorized that her support for \u201cfree and fair elections\u201d when she was Secretary of State was part of the reason that Vladimir Putin hated her so much. Clinton also alluded that authorities leaders like Putin, Mussolini, and Hitler \u201cchanged the rules\u201d of elections to keep themselves in power, hinting that Republicans were doing the same things. \u201cThey believed in elections all right, they believed \u2018one and you\u2019re done,\u2019 get in, change the rules to perpetuate your own power to grow your own authoritarian rule,\u201d she said.",

            "author": "Dr. Susan Berry",
            "content": " Freeman, the assistant editor of the WSJ\u2019s editorial page, noted\u00a0that Republican Sens. Chuck Grassley (IA) and Ron Johnson (WI) wrote\u00a0Monday morning to Attorney General William Barr, asking if he has come up with any answers to the question of whether the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and the Hillary Clinton 2016 presidential campaign used the government of Ukraine \u201cfor the express purpose of finding negative information on then-candidate Trump in order to undermine his campaign.\u201d Grassley originally wrote in July 2017 regarding whether the DNC and the Clinton campaign had used the Ukraine government in order to sabotage the Trump campaign. The senators continued: That letter also highlighted news reports that, during the 2016 presidential election, \u201cUkrainian government officials tried to help Hillary Clinton and undermine Trump\u201d and did so by \u201cdisseminat[ing] documents implicating a top Trump aide in corruption and suggest[ing] they were investigating the matter[.]\u201d Ukrainian officials also reportedly \u201chelped Clinton\u2019s allies research damaging information on Trump and his advisers.\u201d The plan involved\u00a0Alexandra Chalupa, reportedly a \u201cUkrainian-American operative\u201d consulting for the DNC. Chalupa \u201creportedly met with Ukrainian officials during the presidential election for the express purpose of exposing alleged ties between then-candidate Donald Trump, Paul Manafort, and Russia,\u201d Grassley and Johnson wrote to Barr. \u201cThe quotations come from a 2017 story in Politico, hardly a pro-Trump outfit,\u201d Freeman, co-author of Borrowed Time, observed, noting the headline, \u201cUkrainian efforts to sabotage Trump backfire.\u201d \u201cKiev officials are scrambling to make amends with the president-elect after quietly working to boost Clinton,\u201d was the subheading, he pointed out. Politico\u00a0authors Kenneth Vogel and David Stern wrote in that article: Ukrainian government officials tried to help Hillary Clinton and undermine Trump by publicly questioning his fitness for office. They also disseminated documents implicating a top Trump aide in corruption and suggested they were investigating the matter, only to back away after the election. And they helped Clinton\u2019s allies research damaging information on Trump and his advisers, a Politico\u00a0investigation found. The goal of Ukraine\u2019s reported aid to Clinton was to advance \u201cthe narrative that Trump\u2019s campaign was deeply connected to Ukraine\u2019s foe to the east, Russia.\u201d Freeman noted: With the benefit of hindsight and the results of the Mueller investigation, it\u2019s now clear that there was no evidence of Trump campaign collusion with Russia. What is not clear and what demands further investigation is how this baseless claim managed to consume the first two years of an American presidency. Though the idea of such an effort by Ukraine appeared unlikely to some, Vogel and Stern insisted: Politico\u2019s investigation found evidence of Ukrainian government involvement in the race that appears to strain diplomatic protocol dictating that governments refrain from engaging in one another\u2019s elections. Freeman concluded the Politico\u00a0investigation \u201cmay be helpful in figuring out exactly how the surveillance tools of America\u2019s national security apparatus were turned against the party out of power in 2016.\u201d",

So, don\u2019t tell me about words,\u201d Trump said. Fact-Check: TRUE In the mid-1980s, journalist Roy Reed interviewed Hillary Clinton, and\u00a0a tape of that interview has been uploaded to YouTube and is available in the Special Collections Department of the University of Arkansas libraries. \u201cHe took a lie detector test! I had him take a polygraph, which he passed, which forever destroyed my faith in polygraphs,\u201d Clinton said about her client Thomas Alfred Taylor, who raped Shelton in 1975, laughing. Clinton\u00a0also laughed in the video about saving the child rapist from a \u201cmiscarriage of justice.\u201d He served one year in county jail, with two months shaved off his sentence for the time he already served. Shelton\u2019s injuries were so traumatic, she could never have children. WATCH:  Clinton also argued in court that the 12-year-old rape victim sought out older men. Shelton came forward after 40 years of silence, as reported by the Daily Mail: A child rape victim says she cannot forgive Hillary Clinton for defending her rapist in court 40 years ago, saying the Democratic presidential candidate attacked her credibility despite knowing that her assailant was guilty \u2013 and later laughed about it in a taped interview. Kathy Shelton was just 12 years old when a 41-year-old drifter raped her on the side of a desolate Arkansas road in 1975. Now, four decades later, she has agreed to be named and pictured for the first time in this Daily Mail Online exclusive because she is furious that her rapist\u2019s defense attorney \u2013 Hillary Clinton \u2013 has been portraying herself as a lifelong advocate of women and girls on the campaign trail. \u2018It\u2019s put a lot of anger back in me,\u2019 said Shelton, now 54, in an exclusive interview at her Springdale, Arkansas, home in August. \u2018Every time I see [Clinton] on TV I just want to reach in there and grab her, but I can\u2019t do that.\u2019 In 1975, Clinton served as the defense lawyer for Thomas Alfred Taylor, a 41-year-old factory worker accused of raping Shelton after luring her to his car. Taylor pleaded down to \u2018unlawful fondling of a minor\u2019 and served less than a year in prison after Clinton was able to block the admission of forensic evidence that linked her client to the crime. Shelton also tweeted about her suffering at Hillary\u2019s hands.      ",

Clinton stated at the event:\u00a0\u201cI think it\u2019s also critical to understand that, as I\u2019ve been telling candidates who have come to see me, you can run the best campaign, you can even become the nominee, and you can have the election stolen from you.\u201d One huge scandal that appeared to negatively affect Clinton during the 2016 presidential race was cybersecurity-related; the investigation into Clinton\u2019s private email servers by the former FBI Director James Comey. Clinton denied any wrongdoing in the matter but it was discovered that while acting as Secretary of State, Clinton sent classified material from an unsecured server located in her basement. After the server was wiped of all data, Clinton and her team faced suspicions of concealing evidence. Clinton attempted to defend herself from accusations by claiming incompetence in tech matters; when asked if her team had wiped the server she replied:\u00a0\u201cWhat, like with a cloth or something?\u201d She added:\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know how it works digitally at all.\u201d Clinton will be the keynote speaker at the Cyber Defense Summit 2019 which takes place starting October 9.",

So, maybe there does need to be a rematch. I mean, obviously, I can beat him again. But, just seriously, I don\u2019t understand, I don\u2019t think anybody understands what motivates him, other than personal grievance, other than seeking adulation. Clinton is expected to host \u201cDinner and a Conversation\u201d in her Washington, DC, home this month in partnership with the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and Women\u2019s Leadership Forum, adding to the speculation of another presidential bid on the horizon.",

And not only that, China, if you\u2019re listening, why\u00a0don\u2019t you get Trump\u2019s tax returns.\u00a0 I\u2019m sure our media would richly reward\u00a0you. Now according to the Mueller report, that is not conspiracy because it\u2019s\u00a0done right out in the open. So, if after this hypothetical Democratic candidate says this on your show,\u00a0within hours, all of a sudden, the IRS offices are bombarded with\u00a0incredibly sophisticated cyber tools looking for Trump\u2019s tax returns, and\u00a0then extracts and them and then passes them to whatever the new WikiLeaks\u00a0happens to be and they start being unraveled and disclosed \u2013 nothing wrong\u00a0with that. I mean, if you`re going let Russia get away with what they did and are\u00a0still doing according to Christopher Wray, the current FBI director, who\u00a0said that last week, they\u2019re in our election systems.\u00a0 We\u2019re worried about\u00a02020, he said. So, hey, let`s have a great power contest, and let\u2019s get the Chinese in on\u00a0the side of somebody else.\u00a0 Just saying that shows how absurd the situation\u00a0we find ourselves in. No one called for Clinton to be investigated, much less prosecuted. This week, however, Democrats and journalists alike declared that Trump deserved to be impeached for calling, openly, for China and Ukraine to investigate alleged corruption tied to former Vice President Joe Biden, a 2020 candidate for the Democratic Party nomination. Democrats have been searching for Trump\u2019s old tax returns for years, convinced that they contain incriminating or at least politically embarrassing information. In 2017, Maddow produced his 2005 tax return \u2014 which showed he paid a significant amount in taxes. ",

Using the help of foreign governments to interfere in our election and to undermine people who have been in the public eye for a long time and I hope the American people reject this, as they should. In recent days, President Donald Trump has suggested China and Ukraine investigate alleged corruption committed by the Biden family.\u00a0As Breitbart News extensively reported, Hunter Biden\u2019s investment company scored a\u00a0$1.5 billion investment deal\u00a0with the Bank of China after traveling with his father on Air Force Two to the country in 2013. Further,\u00a0then-vice president\u00a0Biden forced out former Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin as he was investigating the gas giant Burisma Holdings, which was paying Hunter Biden $83,000 monthly as a member of its board, despite his lack of expertise in the energy sector. Biden later\u00a0boasted\u00a0before the Council of Foreign Relations last year that he had threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid unless the prosecutor was fired. Clinton may have a personal dog in this fight, as the Biden allegations first came from a book by Peter Schweizer \u2014 investigative journalist, president of the Government Accountability Institute, and senior contributor to Breitbart News \u2014 called Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends. The book functions as a spiritual sequel to Schweizer\u2019s\u00a0Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich. That book\u2019s findings, confirmed even by Democrat-friendly corporate media, became a major problem for her campaign and may have helped in the decline of The Clinton Foundation.",

On foreign inference in the 2016 presidential election, Clinton said, \u201cSince it worked for them, why would they quit.\u201d She continued, \u201cThere is this bizarre adulation Trump has for dictators and authoritarians. He dreams of being able to order people to do things and make them do it. He has no democratic instincts, really. I saw that when I was secretary of state and traveled to 112 countries. One of our big problems were people who got themselves elected and then became\u00a0authoritarian. And then did\u00a0everything they could to rig the elections, everything they could to make sure they could never be forced out of power. That is his game plan. That is what he is trying to achieve.\u201d Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN",

She did not mention Clinton. But on Friday, Gabbard let loose:    Gabbard, who supported Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) in the 2016 presidential election, resigned a leadership post in the Democratic National Committee (DNC) in protest at its favoritism toward Clinton. The left has long resented Clinton for voting to authorize the Iraq War. She also took credit for the war in Libya \u2014 a war that had disastrous results, as it allowed terrorist groups to take root across northern Africa. Clinton was widely blamed by conservatives for lax security around the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, which was attacked on Sep. 11, 2012. The Obama administration originally characterized the attack as a protest against an anti-Islamic video posted by an obscure American filmmaker on YouTube. Hillary Clinton has continued to blame Russia for her loss to Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election. She also criticized the Obama administration \u2014 after leaving it \u2014 for not intervening in Syria sooner. Gabbard is a critic of U.S. involvement in Syria. ",

You have to side with them.\u201d The person said one of those activists alerted Clinton to Nielsen\u2019s slot on the schedule earlier this week, after which Clinton\u2019s team notified Fortune that she would no longer be attending the event. Friday evening, Clinton\u2019s name and headshot were removed from the summit\u2019s website.

The incident came back into the spotlight over the weekend when footage of Biden\u2019s remarks began circulating social media.",
            "author": "Haris Alic",
            "content": " The former vice president, who has come under scrutiny in recent weeks for embellishing portions of his personal and\u00a0political\u00a0life, told the story when being honored with having a community pool named after him in a Wilmington, Delaware, historically black neighborhood. Biden had reportedly been the only white lifeguard at the pool during the early 1960s when segregation was still in effect. The event started with Biden discussing how his time as a lifeguard had opened his eyes about racial injustice and privilege. It, however, quickly took a strange turn when Biden, flanked by children from the local community,\u00a0decided to recount a nearly violent altercation he had at the pool with a misbehaving swimmer. \u201cCorn Pop was a bad dude, and he ran a bunch of bad boys. Back in those days, to show how things have changed \u2026 if you used pomade in your hair, you had to wear a bathing cap,\u201d Biden said. \u201cHe was up on the board and wouldn\u2019t listen to me, so I said \u2018Hey, Esther, you, off the board or I\u2019ll come up and drag you off.'\u201d Corn Pop, according to the former vice president, did not take kindly to being called \u201cEsther\u201d \u2014 an \u201cemasculating\u201d reference to the 1950s swimmer Esther Williams,\u00a0as the Washington Post noted \u2014 and promised to \u201cmeet\u201d him outside. Biden realized he had to take Corn Pop seriously when he purportedly saw the gang leader waiting around for him with three other guys carrying straight razors.  In his 2007 autobiography,\u00a0Promises to Keep: On Life and Politics, Biden\u00a0admitted that he specifically signaled out Corn Pop for violating the pool\u2019s rules to show he \u201cwasn\u2019t an easy mark.\u201d The former vice president also wrote that his first instinct was to call the police, but he was convinced by the pool\u2019s mechanic, a white former Navy sailor named Bill Wright, that doing so would ensure he would never be trusted by the neighborhood\u2019s black community. Instead, Wright suggested Biden confront Corn Pop and the others with \u201ca six-foot length of chain.\u201d Biden, as he described in his autobiography, took the advice, walked outside, and said, \u201cYou might cut me, Corn Pop, but I\u2019m going to wrap this chain around your head before you do.\u201d \u201cI looked at him, but I was smart then,\u201d Biden told the audience in 2017. He said he told Corn Pop, \u201cfirst of all, when I tell you to get off the board, you get off the board, and I\u2019ll kick you out again, but I shouldn\u2019t have called you Esther Williams. I apologize for that. \u2026 I apologize for what I said.\u201d The apology seemed to diffuse the situation, much to Biden\u2019s relief. \u201cHe said \u2018okay,\u2019 closed his straight razor, and my heart began to beat again,\u201d the former vice president said. The story came back into the spotlight on Saturday after numerous individuals shared clips from the 2017 pool dedication on social media. Many of those seeing the clip for the first time immediately accused the former vice president of fabricating the story. Most notably, Michael Harriot, a senior writer for The Root, took to social media to blast the story as \u201calien-like.\u201d     Although Biden\u2019s retelling of the altercation was corroborated at the dedication ceremony by a former chairman of the Delaware NAACP, those unaware of the fact agreed with Harriot that the story seemed comically embellished if not totally concocted. Biden, himself, has not done his credibility any favors in recent weeks by downplaying his fabrication of an emotional story about the war in Afghanistan, even after the Post\u00a0debunked nearly every detail.",

CNN\u2019s town hall, titled Equality in America,\u00a0is set to air Thursday evening, from\u00a07:30 p.m. to 12 a.m. ET, and will feature nine Democratic presidential candidates. The event is co-organized by the\u00a0Human Rights Campaign Foundation, a non-profit focused on LGBTQ issues. The town hall comes amidst increased U.S.-China tensions \u2014 a subject that hits close to home in the entertainment industry, \u00a0which depends heavily on Chinese consumers to buy movie tickets and visit theme parks. Hollywood executives have remained conspicuously quiet about U.S.-China relations in the wake of democracy protests in Hong Kong that have put global businesses including the NBA to Apple in a difficult spot. President Donald Trump has publicly hammered Biden over his close ties with China, accusing the former Vice President and his son, Hunter,\u00a0\u00a0of being \u201cpaid off\u201d by foreign interests. Moderators of Thursday\u2019s town hall include CNN\u2019s Dana Bash, Anderson Cooper, Chris Cuomo, Don Lemon and Nia-Malika Henderson. Sen. Harris (D-CA) reportedly attended a reception at The Abbey in West Hollywood on Wednesday, while\u00a0Buttigieg is set to attend a fundraiser at the Belasco Theater in downtown L.A. Deadline reported earlier this week that Buttigieg\u00a0attended a separate L.A. fundraiser on Tuesday at the home of former CAA agent Michael Kives, who is now head of the investment advisory firm K5 Global.

            "author": "Robert Kraychik",
            "content": " Schweizer joined Tuesday\u2019s edition of SiriusXM\u2019s Breitbart News Tonight with hosts Rebecca Mansour and Joel Pollak. Schweizer said, \u201cI think a deeper problem that [Joe Biden] faces is \u2014 as has been reported on Breitbart and reported at the Hill, today \u2014 which I think is far deeper is the fact that his family, particularly his son, cashed in while he was vice president of the United States.\u201d LISTEN:  John Solomon reported on Hunter Biden\u2019s receiving millions of dollars from Burisma Holdings after being installed on the company\u2019s board during his father\u2019s vice presidential tenure: U.S. banking records show Hunter Biden\u2019s American-based firm, Rosemont Seneca Partners LLC, received regular transfers into one of its accounts \u2013 usually more than $166,000 a month \u2013 from Burisma from spring 2014 through fall 2015, during a period when Vice President Biden was the main U.S. official dealing with Ukraine and its tense relations with Russia.\u201d The general prosecutor\u2019s official file for the Burisma probe \u2013 shared with me by senior Ukrainian officials \u2013 shows prosecutors identified Hunter Biden, business partner Devon Archer and their firm, Rosemont Seneca, as potential recipients of money. Shokin told me in written answers to questions that, before he was fired as general prosecutor, he had made \u201cspecific plans\u201d for the investigation that \u201cincluded interrogations and other crime-investigation procedures into all members of the executive board, including Hunter Biden.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve talked before about the deals he procured with the government for China,\u201d remembered Schweizer. \u201cThe other place [Joe Biden\u2019s] son, Hunter Biden, procured a big deal was in Ukraine. In Ukraine, it involved an energy company called Burisma, which is a very corrupt organization headed by an oligarch named Mykola Zlochevsky who is very close to ViktorYanukovich, the pro-Russian leader.\u201d Schweizer asked, \u201cThere\u2019s all kinds of questions and implications. Is there a Russian component to this, because Burisma is such a corrupt company?\u201d \u201cThe bottom line is Joe Biden was the Obama administration\u2019s point-person on policy towards Ukraine,\u201d noted Schweizer. \u201cHe steered $1.8 billion in aid to that government and while he was doing so, his son got a sweetheart deal with this energy company \u2013 that we\u2019ve been able to trace over just a 14-month period \u2013 paid $3.1 million into an account where Hunter Biden was getting paid.\u201d Schweizer highlighted Hunter Biden\u2019s lack of professional or experiential bona fides in terms of his board position at Burisma Holdings. \u201cSuffice to say, Hunter Biden has no background in Ukraine,\u201d stated Schweizer. \u201cHe has no background in energy policy. There\u2019s really no legitimate explanation as to why he got this deal with this energy company, other than the fact his father was responsible for doling out money in Ukraine itself.\u201d Schweizer went on, \u201cIt\u2019s a huge problem, and it goes to this question of corruption and potential payoffs and bribes that these foreign entities were making to the Bidens in exchange for hopefully getting favorable treatment.\u201d Despite the Robert Mueller-led operation\u2019s ostensible pursuit of \u201ccollusion\u201d between President Donald Trump and the Russian state, Schweizer noted actual financial dealings between the Biden family and foreign interests. Schweizer said, \u201cOne of the phrases that has been tossed around as it relates to the Russian collusion hoax was \u2018obstruction of justice\u2019 by Trump, and there\u2019s been no \u2014 at least in my mind \u2014 evidence that that ever happened, and it doesn\u2019t seem that Mueller felt any charges should be brought on that count. But in this case, you would have a pretty clear-cut case of obstruction of justice, where Joe Biden is saying to Ukrainian officials, \u2018We are not going to give you this billion-dollar loan guarantee unless you fire this guy.'\u201d Schweizer added, \u201cThere is far more evidence of collusion involving Joe Biden \u2014 or even involving the Clintons \u2014 of collusion with these foreign powers than there was with Donald Trump, because you actually have the transaction of money, you have very favorable policies that were carried out. I think \u2018collusion\u2019 is not too strong a word. I think it\u2019s a pretty accurate word.\u201d Schweizer added, \u201cThere\u2019s no question. The Bidens got a lot of money \u2014 millions of dollars \u2014 from these foreign powers. Hunter Biden had no legitimate reasons to get the deal. He simply wasn\u2019t qualified.\u201d Schweizer warned of politicians and officials monetizing their political influence. \u201cSo what [Joe Biden] is doing is using U.S. taxpayer government resources for the personal benefit of his family, and by the way, all of this absolutely rings true,\u201d remarked Schweizer. \u201cJoe Biden was the Obama administration\u2019s person on Ukraine, he traveled to that country something like 17 times during his tenure as vice president, which is pretty amazing.\u201d Schweizer went on, \u201cWhat\u2019s remarkable is when, a couple of days before Donald Trump was inaugurated in Washington, D.C., Joe Biden was actually in Ukraine. It\u2019s pretty remarkable for a vice president of the United States to be overseas that late in the game, but he was in Ukraine. [Joe Biden\u2019s] sway and influence there was enormous, and it raises all kinds of questions about the way that he used or abused government power, and of course it raises questions about what potentially did Ukrainians have on Hunter Biden.\u201d \u201cWhat kind of evidence and information do we have?\u201d asked Schweizer of corruption concerns regarding Joe Biden. \u201cWe know that millions of dollars flowed into Hunter Biden\u2019s accounts. We know that he was not qualified for the job, and the question is, what did he get for Ukrainians in return? I think that\u2019s all the sort of thing that needs to be investigated and looked into by a grand jury.\u201d Schweizer added, \u201cYou have a pattern with Hunter Biden. Of a couple of cases that we know of and others that are lingering out there. We know in the case of China he flies with his dad on Air Force Two in December of 2013 and ten days later, his firm gets a $1 billion private equity deal with the Chinese government.\u201d Schweizer continued, \u201cAgain, [Hunter Biden\u2019s] firm has no background in China. Hunter Biden has no background in China. It\u2019s just odd. About four months later, he gets this deal with the Ukrainians, particularly with Burisma. What we also know is, based on financial account records that came out [from] Morgan Stanley that was managed by Hunter Biden\u2019s business partner, a guy named Devon Archer, he handled an account for Morgan Stanley and that account sent huge sums of money to Hunter Biden.\u201d Schweizer went on, \u201cNot only does that account show money coming in from the Chinese and Ukrainians. There\u2019s also $1.2 million that comes from this LLC that we can\u2019t trace. it comes from a boutique Swiss bank account that\u2019s been implicated in money-laundering in ten countries. There\u2019s $145,000 from the son of the former prime minister of Kazakhstan, which is of course a highly corrupt country with all sorts of interesting implications. The point is, Ukraine is not an isolated case. China is not an isolated case.\u201d Joe Biden seems to have monetized his vice presidential powers, speculated Schweizer. Schweizer stated, \u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear you have a pattern that the for-sale sign was open with the Biden family, and that a lot of foreign powers \u2014 including foreign governments \u2014 basically took them up on the offer and gave money to Hunter Biden. That, in and of itself, I think demands investigation in the United States.\u201d \u201cThese financial records by Morgan Stanley [are] very, very clear,\u201d declared Schweizer. \u201cIt shows line after line after line of money going into an account that is marked \u2018Robert H. Biden,\u2019 which is Hunter Biden\u2019s legal name, and it shows huge sums of money coming in from Ukrainians, Chinese, Kazakhs, and anonymous LLCs. It\u2019s all there in black and white.\u201d Hunter Biden sat on the board of Bohai Harvest RST \u2014 an obscure private equity firm \u2014 which\u00a0secured a $1.5 billion investment from the Chinese government, noted Schweizer. \u201cThe deal with China that he had was the first financial deal with the Chinese government that allowed moving assets to the Shanghai Free Trade Zone. So, J.P. Morgan didn\u2019t have this kind of deal, Goldman Sachs didn\u2019t have this kind of deal, Bank of America, Deutsche Bank, the only firm that had this deal was this small boutique firm that had been started a couple of years ago by the vice president\u2019s son.\u201d In March 2018, an aide of Joe Biden\u2019s\u00a0dismissed Schweizer\u2019s investigations and research given Schweizer\u2019s relationship with Breitbart News:\u00a0\u201cWe aren\u2019t going to engage on a politically motivated hit pieces based on a series of demonstrable, factual errors from a Breitbart-affiliated author and his financial backers.\u201d Schweizer said, \u201cSo he can huff and puff and attack me personally all he wants. In part, he attacked me because of my role as an editor at Breitbart, but that doesn\u2019t erase the facts.\u201d On March 12, Joe Biden said he could not \u201cthink of any reason\u201d he would not run for president.\u00a0In December 2018,\u00a0 he said \u201canybody can beat\u201d Donald Trump in 2020\u2019s forthcoming presidential election.

            "subtitle": "Former Vice President Joe Biden added to his long list of gaffes at Wednesday evening\u2019s Democrat presidential primary debate in Detroit, botching everything from the price tag of his opponents\u2019 health care plans to his own closing statement.",
            "author": "Joshua Caplan",
            "content": " Here are seven moments where Biden\u00a0\u2014 now 76-years-old \u2014 misspoke, lost his train of thought, or blurted out actual nonsense during the late-night debate. 1.) Biden tells Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) ahead of the debate: \u201cGo easy on me, kid.\u201d While it may have been his intended word choice, the disrespect to a sitting senator started his debate performance on the wrong foot and distracted from whatever positive message he may have offered. The hot-mic moment was further undermined when Biden went negative on Harris without provocation. 2.) Biden misstates the cost of Harris\u2019s health care plan. On the topic of health care, Biden stated the California Democrat\u2019s \u201cMedicare for All\u201d proposal would cost a staggering $30 trillion \u2014 but he first mistakenly pegged its price tag at only $3 trillion.\u00a0The 2020 frontrunner later repeated the $30 trillion figure, claiming Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT)\u00a0\u201cacknowledges it,\u201d asserting \u201cThirty trillion dollars has to ultimately be paid.\u201d An analysis estimates Sanders\u2019 \u201cMedicare for all\u201d plan would cost the federal government $32.6 trillion over a decade, rendering Biden\u2019s $3 trillion wildly inaccurate. Biden also grossly understated the\u00a0Obama administration\u2019s\u00a010-year\u00a0stimulus\u00a0package of roughly $800\u00a0billion, saying it was $87 billion. 3.) Biden loses his train of thought on health care. \u201cWe immediately are able to cover everybody who wants to get off of their insurance plan they don\u2019t like, no matter what one it is, and buy into a Medicare option,\u201d Biden said. \u201cAnd they can buy the gold plan, and they\u2019re not going to have to pay.\u201d At this moment, rather than complete his explanation of his plan, he offered a verbal pause\u00a0\u2014 \u201canyway\u201d\u00a0\u2014 and trailed off. 4.) Calls Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) \u201cthe future president.\u201d During a contentious exchange on crime legislation, Biden inadvertently predicted a Booker victory in 2020 before correcting himself, saying: \u201cThe fact is that the bills that the president, excuse me, the future president, that the senator is talking about are bills that were passed years ago and they were passed overwhelmingly.\u201d Biden still appeared to have trouble with his words coming out of the gaffe, which drew a big laugh. His continued statement had several awkward phrases: \u201c[The bills] that the senator is talking about are bills that were passed years ago and they were passed overwhelmingly. Since 2007, I, for example, tried to get the crack-powder-cocaine totally\u00a0\u2014 disparity totally eliminated\u201d (emphasis added). 5.) Appears to have misunderstood question about coal. CNN debate moderator Dana Bash asked Biden to clarify his comments on coal, fossil fuels, and fracking. She asks him about the continued existence of those industries, and he appears to agree \u2013but then limits the scope of his answer to subsidies. DANA BASH:\u00a0thank you, vice president.\u00a0just to clarify, would there be\u00a0any place for fossil fuels\u00a0including coal and fracking in a\u00a0biden administration? JOE BIDEN:\u00a0No. We would work it out. We would make sure it\u2019s\u00a0eliminated, and no more subsidies\u00a0for either one of those, any fossil fuel. Biden\u2019s climate change policy makes no mention of eliminating coal as a resource, though it calls for helping coal industry-dependent communities transition to other jobs. 6.) Calls the\u00a0Trans-Pacific Partnership\u00a0(TPP) the \u201cTTP.\u201d Biden said he opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a 12-nation trade agreement headed up by Obama administration, saying:\u00a0\u201cI would not rejoin the TTP [sic] as it was initially put forward. I would insist that we renegotiate pieces of that with the Pacific nations\u2026 so that we could bring them together to hold China accountable.\u201d 7.) Joe\u2019s botched closing statement goes viral. Biden made the debate\u2019s biggest gaffe by screwing up the contact information for his campaign\u2019s text message service. \u201cIf you agree with me, Go to Joe 3-0-3-3-0, thank you very much,\u201d\u00a0Biden said. A cyber-squatter quickly purchased\u00a0\u201cjoe30330.com\u201d after the flub, directing the URL to an unrelated page.\u00a0Biden also messed by arguing that the United States can not handle another \u201ceight years\u201d of a Trump presidency. Trump can only serve for five more years after 2019. ",

            "content": " The Post\u2019s editors highlight comments the former vice president and 2020 Democratic contender made at a campaign rally in Iowa last week dismissing the notion that \u201cChina is going to eat out lunch.\u201d \u201cCome on, man,\u201d Biden scoffed, adding that \u201cthey\u2019re not bad people\u201d and \u201cthey\u2019re not competition for us.\u201d The Post op-ed counters Biden\u2019s assertion with the fact that China is the world\u2019s second-largest economy, and its mercantilist state-run economic system seeks to \u201cdominate global markets\u201d by \u201cstealing intellectual property wherever it can and bribing and bullying other nations with its Belt and Road program to lock up markets across the globe, among other cheats.\u201d As for Biden\u2019s \u201cnot bad people\u201d claim, the Post points to the Beijing regime\u2019s\u00a0flagrant and ruthless oppression of its own people, including the forced internment of one million Uighur Muslims\u00a0into re-education camps. The Post then notes the close financial ties that the private equity firm of Biden\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, has with China\u2019s regime, as documented in Peter Schweizer\u2019s bestselling book, Secret Empires. Beijing is also busy making Big Brother a 21st century reality. Biden should know that, since his son Hunter is an investor in a firm, Bohai Harvest RST, that\u2019s deeply involved in Face++ \u2014 a mobile phone app that Beijing built to spy on its own public. Indeed, the younger Biden has long been in deep with China\u2019s \u201cnot bad\u201d elite, as Peter Schweizer revealed in his book \u201cSecret Empires.\u201d Notably, Hunter\u2019s private equity firm, Rosemont Seneca Partners LLC, swung a $1.5 billion investment deal with the state-owned Bank of China even as his then-vice president dad was engaged in high-end diplomacy with Beijing. Hmm. Maybe Joe Biden just doesn\u2019t dare think about just what \u201cbad folks\u201d China\u2019s rulers really are. Hunter Biden\u2019s Chinese investment firm, Bohai Harvest RST, obtains its financing from a subsidiary of the Communist government-owned Bank of China. As Breitbart\u2019s John Hayward reported, Face++, the tech company Bohai Harvest RST invested in, \u201cprovided the facial-recognition software integrated into the smartphone app used by Chinese security forces to monitor the Uighur Muslims of Xinjiang province. The app plugs into a massive central database that collects an incredible amount of information about Xinjiang citizens, ranging from how much electricity they use to their DNA.\u201d In a March interview with Fox News Channel\u2019s Laura Ingraham, Schweizer explained\u00a0the troubling circumstances surrounding Hunter Biden\u2019s lucrative bank deal with the Chinese government at a time when his father was negotiating U.S. policy with the regime. \u201cIn December of 2013, Hunter Biden flies on Air Force 2 to Beijing, China, with his father,\u201d Schweizer said. \u201cHis father meets with Chinese officials, he\u2019s very soft on Beijing. The most important thing that happens [is] ten days after they return. And that\u2019s when Hunter Biden\u2019s small, private equity firm called Rosemont Seneca Partners gets a $1 billion private equity deal with the Chinese government, not with the Chinese corporation, with the government. And what people need to realize is Hunter Biden has no background in China. He has no background in private equity. The deal he got in the Shanghai free-trade zone, nobody else had \u2014 Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Blackstone, nobody had this deal.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no question when you chart what Joe Biden is doing with China \u2014 the meetings he\u2019s having and the deals that his son is procuring at the same time \u2014 that they are buying off Biden through his son. I think it\u2019s crystal clear,\u201d Schweizer added. In an interview last year with SiriusXM\u2019s Breitbart News Tonight, Schweizer explained China\u2019s foreign influence peddling tactic to get favorable treatment from American politicians. \u201cThe Chinese government has figured out that the way to get favorable treatment from policymakers in Washington, DC, is by, basically, signing sweetheart deals with the children of politicians because they think by doing so, they\u2019ll get better policy positions from our government,\u201d Schweizer said. \u201cAnd the history indicates in the Obama administration that that\u2019s exactly what happens.\u201d Schweizer, the president of the nonpartisan Government Accountability Institute and a senior editor-at-large for Breitbart News, wrote the bestselling 2015 expos\u00e9\u00a0Clinton Cash, which is widely\u00a0credited\u00a0for its instrumental impact on Hillary Clinton\u2019s failed 2016 presidential campaign due to Schweizer\u2019s\u00a0copious\u00a0documentation\u00a0of the former secretary of state\u2019s history of amassing wealth from donors seeking favorable actions from her State Department. Schweizer\u2019s research on Hunter Biden has already\u00a0triggered\u00a0Democratic strategists worried that Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 campaign could suffer the same fate as Clinton\u2019s. The similarities between the two candidates are hard to dismiss: both are\u00a0establishment favorites, both are Obama administration\u00a0alums, and both are tainted by accusations that they used their authority as government officials to benefit their family to the potential detriment of U.S. foreign policy. Biden currently leads in the polls among the Democratic 2020 contenders. A Hill-HarrisX poll released Monday shows Biden with a commanding 32-point lead over his closest competitor, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. The former vice president led the poll at 46 percent, followed by Sanders at 17 percent; South Bend, Indiana, mayor Peter Buttigieg at 8 percent; and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren at 7 percent.  ",

While you often fat check his statements in real time during your discussions, that is no longer enough. By giving him your air time, you are allowing him to introduce increasingly unhinged, unfounded and desperate lies into the national conversation. We write to demand that in service to the fact, you no longer book Rudy Giuliani, a surrogate for Donald Trump who has demonstrated that he will knowingly and willingly lie in order to advance his own narrative. (The Biden campaign itself has been known to lie: the former vice president continues to repeat the Charlottesville \u201cvery fine people\u201d hoax after being confronted about it at the Iowa State Fair by Breitbart News, for example.) The statement goes on to claim that Giuliani\u2019s claims about potential corruption by Hunter Biden in Ukraine are \u201ccompletely baseless.\u201d Giuliani serves as a personal lawyer for President Donald Trump, and has been involved in investigating Hunter Biden\u2019s overseas business interests, which he developed while his father was in office. The former vice president pressured Ukraine to fire a prosecutor who was investigating Burma Holdings, an oil and gas company on whose board Hunter Biden sat at the time \u2014 a clear conflict of interest that Joe Biden has never explained.

Biden favors a \u201cliving Constitution\u201d approach that interprets the Constitution and the law through a \u201cpenumbra\u201d of rights beyond those actually provided in the text. Biden was addressing an audience of about 400 in a local gymnasium to close out his two-day swing through the Palmetto State. He began with his usual stump speech, claiming that President Trump had called neo-Nazis \u201cvery fine people\u201d in \u201cCharlotte\u201d (he meant Charlottesville). In reality, Trump said the neo-Nazis should be \u201ccondemned totally.\u201d Biden added that there was a \u201cdirect line\u201d between Trump\u2019s rhetoric on immigration and the mass shooting in El Paso, Texas, earlier this month. He cited the shooter\u2019s manifesto \u2014 without noting that the shooter said he was\u00a0not inspired by Trump. Among other attacks, Biden also claimed that President Trump was abusing executive power, and pledged to restore constitutional checks and balances. Biden did not mention that all of President Barack Obama\u2019s major achievements after Obamacare were undertaken through executive actions \u2014 such as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), the Iran deal, and the Paris Climate Accords \u2014 often circumventing Congress and directly contravening congressional will.

One Biden supporter tore off the heckler\u2019s hat, though he later retrieved it from the floor. Reporters later shouted questions at Biden about a\u00a0Washington Post story Thursday that accused him of telling a \u201cmoving but false war story\u201d on the campaign trail. He ignored the media and left the venue. The former vice president is leading the state polls by a wide margin, thanks partly to his overwhelming support in the African-American community. He focused his attention on the Upstate area, speaking in Greenville, Spartanburg, Rock Hill, and Gaffney.",

The story, which Biden told to more than 400 voters in Hanover, New Hampshire, quickly made an impact upon everyone in the room. \u201cA four-star general had asked the then-vice president to travel to Kunar province in Afghanistan, a dangerous foray into \u2018godforsaken country\u2019 to recognize the remarkable heroism of a Navy captain,\u201d the Washington\u00a0Post reported on Thursday. \u201cSome told him it was too risky, but Biden said he brushed off their concerns.\u201d \u201cWe can lose a vice president,\u201d Biden claimed to have said when asked to make the trip. \u201cWe can\u2019t lose many more of these kids. Not a joke.\u201d As Biden recollected, the Navy captain \u201crappelled down a 60-foot ravine under fire and retrieved the body of an American comrade, carrying him on his back.\u201d When the captain\u2019s superiors wanted to honor his bravery with a \u201cSilver Star,\u201d the officer refused as it \u201cfelt like a failure\u201d because his comrade had died. \u201cHe said, \u2018Sir, I don\u2019t want the damn thing!\u2019\u201d said Biden, his \u201cjaw clenched\u201d and \u201cvoice rising to a shout,\u201d according to the Post.\u00a0\u201c\u2019Do not pin it on me, Sir! Please, Sir. Do not do that! He died. He died!\u2019\u201d The raw emotion Biden exhibited when telling the harrowing story of bravery and loss left those in attendance \u201csilent.\u201d \u201cThis is the God\u2019s truth,\u201d the former vice president added. \u201cMy word as a Biden.\u201d The only problem, as the Post reported, was that \u201calmost every detail in the story appears to be incorrect.\u201d: Biden visited Kunar province in 2008 as a U.S. senator, not as vice president. The service member who performed the celebrated rescue that Biden described was a 20-year-old Army specialist, not a much older Navy captain. And that soldier, Kyle J. White, never had a Silver Star, or any other medal, pinned on him by Biden. At a White House ceremony six years after Biden\u2019s visit, White stood at attention as President Barack Obama placed a Medal of Honor, the nation\u2019s highest award for valor, around his neck. Upon further investigation, the paper concluded that Biden had conflated three separate stories, including one in which he actually \u201cdid pin a medal on a heartbroken soldier, Army Staff Sgt. Chad Workman, who didn\u2019t believe he deserved the award.\u201d \u201cIn the space of three minutes, Biden got the time period, the location, the heroic act, the type of medal, the military branch and the rank of the recipient wrong, as well as his own role in the ceremony,\u201d the Post elaborated. The story and its inaccuracies come to light as Biden\u2019s campaign is besieged by doubts over his fitness for the presidency after a string of perplexing gaffes. In particular, the former vice president has shown difficulty remembering specific events, locations, and individuals during public appearances. When campaigning in South Carolina on Wednesday, Biden appeared to forget the name of his former runningmate, President Barack Obama. \u201cThey invaded a significant portion of another country and annexed a significant portion of it called Crimea,\u201d Biden said when discussing Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. \u201cHe\u2019s saying it was President \u2014 my boss \u2014 it was his fault.\u201d Such lapses have become more frequent in recent weeks, with Biden at one point even claiming he was vice president during the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland Florida. \u201cThose kids in Parkland came up to see me when I was vice president,\u201d Biden said earlier this month, before claiming that when the survivors visited Congress, lawmakers were \u201cbasically cowering, not wanting to see them. They did not want to face it on camera.\u201d Many were quick to point out that the tragic shooting, which resulted in 17 fatalities and over a dozen injuries, actually occurred on February 14, 2018 \u2014 more than a year after Biden left office. In response to such questionable conduct, an increasing number of individuals on the left have begun raising concerns over Biden\u2019s capacity to serve as commander in chief. \u201cBiden and his team owe it to voters to put him on a real, rigorous public campaign schedule, like everyone else,\u201d Adam Jentleson, a one time top aide to former Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV), said recently. \u201cIf he can hack it, great. If not, better to know sooner rather than later,\u201d Jentleson added. \u201cKeeping him under wraps except for big events while trying to skate by is just sketchy.\u201d",

            "author": "Haris Alic",
            "content": " Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), a former chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, announced her endorsement of the former vice president on Tuesday,\u00a0claiming to have witnessed Biden\u2019s \u201cfortitude\u201d and leadership during their overlapping tenures in Congress. Feinstein said in a statement: I\u2019ve worked closely with Vice President Biden and I\u2019ve seen firsthand his legislative ability, his statesmanship, and most importantly his moral fortitud. During his time in Congress and in the White House, Joe Biden has been a tireless fighter for hard working American families. The endorsement comes as Biden\u2019s presidential campaign is besieged by scandal regarding the lucrative business dealings his youngest son, Hunter, had with foreign governments. Only hours before Feinstein\u2019s endorsement,\u00a0the Chinese government announced it would not investigate how Hunter Biden ended up at the center of one its top private equity firms. The Chinese foreign ministry made the decision after President Donald Trump publicly called for a probe of Hunter Biden\u2019s dealings with Bohai Harvest RST (BHR). In particular, Trump has noted that the circumstances surrounding BHR\u2019s creation could have posed a conflict of interest for Joe Biden. As Peter Schweizer, senior contributor at Breitbart News, revealed in his bestselling\u00a0book\u00a0Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends,\u00a0Hunter Biden inked the multibillion-dollar deal that created BHR with a subsidiary of the state-owned Bank of China in 2013. The timing of the lucrative deal has been brought into question as it came only 12 days after Hunter visited China with his father aboard Air Force Two.\u00a0Officially, the then-vice president was visiting the country amid escalating tensions over islands in the South China Sea and decided to bring his granddaughter and son along. In a March 2018\u00a0interview\u00a0with\u00a0Breitbart News Tonight, however, Schweizer detailed the political machinations that preceded Hunter Biden\u2019s $1.5 billion venture with China: In December of 2013, Vice President Joe Biden flies to Asia for a trip, and the centerpiece for that trip is a visit to Beijing, China. To put this into context, in 2013, the Chinese have just exerted air rights over the South Pacific, the South China Sea. They basically have said, \u2018If you want to fly in this area, you have to get Chinese approval. We are claiming sovereignty over this territory.\u2019 Highly controversial in Japan, in the Philippines, and in other countries. Joe Biden is supposed to be going there to confront the Chinese. Well, he gets widely criticized on that trip for going soft on China. For basically not challenging them, and Japan and other countries are quite upset about this. Since its creation, BHR has invested heavily in energy and defense projects across the globe. As of June,\u00a0Hunter Biden was still\u00a0involved\u00a0with BHR, sitting on its board of directors and owning a minority stake of the fund estimated to be worth more than $430,000. Such dealings at the center of politics and business, while perhaps not illegal, are not exclusive to the Biden family alone. As a few noted at the time of Feinstein\u2019s endorsement, the senator and her husband have their own close ties to the communist country. During her tenure as mayor of San Francisco in the late-1970s and early-1980s, Feinstein took advantage of the newly normalized diplomatic relations between the U.S. and China by establishing one of the first sister city partnership between San Francisco and Shanghai. Through that partnership, Feinstein led trade delegations to China in which she and her husband, Richard Blum, became acquainted with some of the country\u2019s most prominent political leaders. As the Federalist noted in August 2018, Feinstein and her husband leveraged those relationships to boost their own wealth. In 1986, Feinstein and Jiang Zemin \u2014 the then-mayor of Shanghai, who would later ascend to the presidency of the People\u2019s Republic of China \u2014 \u201cdesignated several corporate entities for fostering commercial relations.\u201d One of those firms was Shanghai Pacific Partners, which employed Blum as a director. Blum reportedly had an interest of upwards of $500,000 in a project backed by Shanghai Pacific Partners. After Feinstein was elected to the Senate in 1992, Blum continued profiting off their ties to China. A the same time, the freshman lawmaker was pitching herself as a \u201cChina hand\u201d to colleagues, even once claiming \u201cthat in my last life maybe I was Chinese.\u201d Through her seat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Feinstein led the fight on a number of initiatives seen as being favorable to China, including granting the country\u00a0permanent most-favored-nation trading status in 2000. Despite Feinstein and her husband having a close relationship with Jiang, the Chinese government targeted the senator as part of its espionage operations. In the early 2000s, the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS) recruited a longtime employee of the senator to gather information about the inner workings of her congressional and district offices. Feinstein only learned of the staffer\u2019s duplicity in 2013, after he\u2019d already been on her payroll for more than 20 years. \u201cWhile this person, who was a liaison to the local Chinese community, was fired, charges were never filed against him,\u201d Politico reported in 2018, speculating that because \u201cthe staffer was providing political intelligence and not classified information\u2014making prosecution far more difficult.\u201d Apart from the convoluted history of the senator\u2019s ties to China, the political timing of Feinstein\u2019s endorsement also caught many off guard.\u00a0The California Democrat, who hosted a fundraiser on Biden\u2019s behalf last week\u00a0alongside House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s (D-CA) daughter, is only the most recent figure from the Democrat establishment to openly pledge support for the former vice president. Feinstein\u2019s endorsement, however, was not totally expected, especially since her seamate, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), is mounting a bid of her own for the Democrat nomination. In fact, earlier this year, Feinsten flirted with the notion of remaining neutral in the 2020 contest out of respect for Harris. Compounding the political picture is that most polls show Biden no longer the favorite to win California, having fallen behind Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). Feinstein, however, did not address any of that when endorsing the former vice president on Tuesday. Instead, the senator offered platitudes about Biden\u2019s work to enhance gun control and how his campaign was a \u201cfight to restore the soul of the nation.\u201d",

            "content": " In a speech to the Asian and Latino Coalition PAC, Biden promised to increase the level of legal immigration to the country beyond the roughly 1.2 million legal immigrants that are admitted every year, booming the foreign-born population to an unprecedented 45 million \u2014 a 108-year record high. Specifically, Biden said the U.S. can \u201cin a heartbeat\u201d import another two million immigrants today. Biden said: We could afford to take in a heartbeat another two million people. The idea that a country of 330 million people is cannot absorb people who are in desperate need \u2026 is absolutely bizarre \u2026\u00a0I would also move to increase the total number of immigrants able to come to the United States. [Emphasis added] In addition to an increase in legal immigration levels, Biden said his national immigration plan would ensure that all 11 to 22 million illegal aliens living across the U.S. receive amnesty and a pathway to American citizenship. Likewise, Biden said it is \u201cimmigration\u201d that has \u201cbuilt this country,\u201d reiterating the claim that the U.S. is a \u201cnation of immigrants,\u201d calling it \u201ca fact.\u201d Biden\u2019s comments come after the latest Harvard/Harris Poll finds that swing voters by a majority, as well as nearly every other demographic group, say they are less likely to support a 2020 presidential candidate who wants more illegal and legal immigration to the U.S. Currently, the nation\u2019s\u00a0Washington, DC-imposed\u00a0mass legal and illegal immigration policy \u2014 whereby at least 1.5 million unskilled foreign nationals are admitted to the U.S. every year \u2014 is a boon to corporate executives, Wall Street, big business, and multinational corporations, as\u00a0America\u2019s working and middle class have their\u00a0wealth redistributed\u00a0to the country\u2019s\u00a0top earners\u00a0through wage stagnation. Research by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine has discovered that immigration to the country shifts about $500 billion in wages away from working and middle-class Americans toward new arrivals and economic elites. Similarly, research by Steven Camarotta has found that every one percent increase in the immigrant composition of an occupation\u2019s labor force\u00a0reduces\u00a0Americans\u2019 hourly wages by 0.4 percent. Every one percent increase in the immigrant workforce reduces Americans\u2019 overall wages by 0.8 percent. In the last decade alone, the U.S. has\u00a0admitted\u00a0ten million legal immigrants, forcing American workers to compete against a growing population of low-wage foreign workers. Meanwhile, if legal immigration continues, there will be\u00a069 million foreign-born\u00a0residents living in the U.S. by 2060 and a total population of more than 404 million residents. ",

            "author": "Haris Alic",
            "content": " The tense altercation occurred during a campaign stop in Los Angeles, California, where the former vice president was asked if Hunter Biden\u2019s service on the board of directors of Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian oil and gas giant, had posed a conflict of interest during his time in the White House. Biden, who in the past had refused to discuss his son\u2019s business dealings with foreign governments, appeared perturbed by the question. \u201cIt\u2019s not a conflict of interest,\u201d the former vice president said. \u201cThere\u2019s been no indication of any conflict of interest, from Ukraine or anywhere else, period. I\u2019m not going to respond to that.\u201d  The question regarding the potential conflict of interest came only hours after the newly appointed Ukrainian Prosecutor General\u00a0 announced he was reviewing allegations of criminal conduct against Burisma. Hunter\u00a0Biden joined the company\u2019s board of directors in April 2014, despitehaving no prior background in either the energy industry or Ukraine. As Peter Schweizer, senior contributor at Breitbart News, detailed in his\u00a0book\u00a0\u00a0Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friend,\u00a0Hunter Biden secured the position, which paid as much as\u00a0$83,000 per month, around the same time his father was tapped to lead the Obama administration\u2019s policy in Ukraine. The timing of Hunter Biden\u2019s ascension to Burisma\u2019s board\u00a0immediately raised questions from ethics watchdogs in both the U.S. and Europe concerning conflicts of interest. Adding to the ethical cloud over that appointment was that Mykola Zlochevsky, Burisma\u2019s founder,\u00a0had his assets\u00a0seized\u00a0in the United Kingdom for suspicion of money laundering. Many have speculated Hunter Biden\u2019s position on Burisma\u2019s board was an attempt by Zlochevsky to curry favor with western leaders to prevent further scrutiny of his business dealings. Such a brazen attempt would not be totally ill-suited for Zlochevsky. The Burisma founder is rumored to be one of eastern Europe\u2019s top oligarchs, a position obtained while serving in the Ukrainian government under former President\u00a0Viktor\u00a0Yanukovych \u2014 a staunch ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin. It was during his tenure in government as Ukraine\u2019s minister of natural resources that Burisma\u00a0received\u00a0its oil and gas licenses. It is in the context of Burisma and Zlochevsky\u2019s legal troubles that Joe Biden\u2019s political influence has raised the most red flags. The former vice president has particularly drawn questions over his conduct in demanding the Ukrainian government fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, in 2016. Biden, who has publicly\u00a0bragged\u00a0about the firing, reportedly threatened to withhold more than one billion dollars in U.S. aid if the Ukrainian government did not remove Shokin. He has claimed the demand came from then-President Barack Obama, who had allegedly lost faith in the prosecutor\u2019s ability to tackle corruption. Unofficially, though, it was well known Shokin was investigating both Burisma and Zlochevsky for public corruption. It is uncertain if the probe extended to Hunter Biden, although Shokin has recently admitted that prior to his ouster, he was warned to\u00a0back off\u00a0of the matter. Regardless of what occurred, Shokin\u2019s successor dropped the investigation into Burisma and Zlochevsky Since President Donald Trump suggested the matter be looked into by Ukraine, an action that\u00a0launched\u00a0an impeachment inquiry by the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives, Biden has worked to minimize his role in the entire proceeding. Part of that strategy has been to pivot the conversation away from Hunter Biden and Burisma by accusing Trump of abusing his power in suggesting Ukraine probe the issue. \u201cLet\u2019s focus on the problem, focus on this man, what he\u2019s doing, that no president has ever done,\u201d Biden told the media on Friday.",

Specifically, they\u2019re trying to get access to something called the AP-1000 nuclear reactor that is very similar to the ones that we put on U.S. submarines,\u201d Schweizer wrote. \u201cSo again, you have the son of the vice president, a close aide to the secretary of state who are investing in a company that is trying to steal nuclear secrets in the United States. It\u2019s a stunning story, and here\u2019s the thing: none of this is required to be disclosed because they\u2019ve figured out a way to get around these disclosure laws,\u201d Schweizer continued.",

But the reality is no agents want to go on his detail because Biden makes agents\u2019 lives so tough.\u201d Kessler elaborated further in a television interview. \u201cBiden likes to swim nude both at his Vice President\u2019s residence in Washington and also at his home in Wilmington which he goes back to several times a week \u2026 and this offends female Secret Service agents,\u201d he told Fox News\u2019s Sean Hannity. \u201cThey signed up to take a bullet for the President as you said but they didn\u2019t sign up to \u2014 they certainly didn\u2019t sign up to see Biden naked.

There is nothing wrong with skinny-dipping \u2026 in private, and I can sympathize with those who lose their privacy when security is necessary. But no one forced Joe Biden to accept the role of vice president. He knew the deal going in, and to expose his naked body to female Secret Service agents is not only disrespectful and arrogant, it reeks of a perverse exploitation and abuse of power. Naturally, the fake establishment media ignored the story at the time, just as they are now ignoring and even excusing Biden\u2019s well-documented and very creepy predilection for inappropriately touching young women and children. Two women have already come forward to accuse Biden of inappropriately touching them, and there are countless photos and video clips of Biden creeping out women and children with unwanted touching, nuzzling, and kissing. But media elitists\u00a0such as Meghan McCain, Mika Brzezinski, and Alyssa Milano still defend him. But this has nothing to do with principle on their part.

Biden also claimed that President Trump\u2019s withdrawing most U.S. forces in Syria in the advance of a Turkish offensive is \u201cthe most shameful thing that any president has done in modern history\u201d in terms of foreign policy \u2014 glossing over the 2003 Iraq War and his own support for it. The Iraq War led to more than 4,500 U.S. forces dead and tens of thousands more wounded. Also, it was executed by President George W. Bush and supported by Biden. Biden later claimed he was immediately against the Iraq War after voting to authorize it in 2002, but FactCheck.org showed that it was three years before he began opposing it. While he was vice president in 2011, the Obama administration also withdrew all U.S. forces from Iraq, which created a vacuum for the rise of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). The Obama administration also did not support moderate Syrian protesters before the Syrian civil war began, which prompted some to turn to Islamist groups for help, fueling the civil war and ISIS\u2019s numbers in Syria. The Syrian civil war has led to hundreds of thousands of Syrians killed, about eight million Syrians displaced from their homes, a refugee crisis, and terrorist attacks in Europe. Despite this, Biden touted his foreign policy record, stating that \u201cour commanders across the board, former and present, are ashamed.\u201d Actually, only retired commanders \u2014 some of whom worked for the Obama administration \u2014 have expressed shame. He said, \u201cAnd the fact of the matter is, I\u2019ve never seen a time \u2014 and I\u2019ve spent thousands of hours in the Situation Room, I\u2019ve spent many hours on the ground in those very places, in Syria and in Iraq, and guess what? Our commanders across the board, former and present, are ashamed of what\u2019s happening here.\u201d Furthermore, he stated that he would make it clear to Assad that \u201che\u2019s going to have a problem\u201d with Turkey and tell Turkey it will pay a \u201cheavy price\u201d for invading Syria. (Trump has already threatened to tank Turkey\u2019s economy and imposed sanctions.)

            "author": "Haris Alic",
            "content": " The New York Times\u00a0was first to report the meeting on Sunday, noting the financiers were treated to a behind-the-scenes view of the campaign\u2019s headquarters and strategy, including a private address by the former vice president. \u201cIn a sign of the attendees\u2019 significant financial firepower, Mr. Biden himself addressed the several dozen donors who came to the retreat on Saturday, rallying them for 45 minutes about the months ahead, people there said,\u201d the Times reported. \u201cThe campaign kept the session with Mr. Biden behind closed doors, despite pledging to open them to the press.\u201d The meeting comes as the campaign is besieged by questions over Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings in Ukraine as well as polls showing the former vice president is no longer the frontrunner among 2020 Democrats. Biden, who once led the field by\u00a0as much 26 percentage points, now trails Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) in the early states of Iowa and New Hampshire. Adding to the campaign\u2019s trouble is the fact that their fundraising numbers were eclipsed this quarter not only by Warren but also Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-VT) and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg \u2014 who polled significantly below the former vice president. Biden\u2019s mounting problems and the emergence of Warren as the most direct threat was not far from the minds of those gathered in attendance in Philadelphia. \u201cWe need him to get the nomination because he\u2019s the one who can win,\u201d Denise Bauer, a Biden bundler and former ambassador to Belgium, told the Times. To stress the point, she added that the former vice president\u2019s donors were \u201cgoing to try to raise every single dollar we can.\u201d It is unclear if such efforts will be successful enough to\u00a0save the 76-year-old Biden\u2019s third White House bid. Unlike Warren or Sanders, the former vice president\u2019s fundraising has failed to diversify past the top-dollar level.\u00a0According to the Center for Responsive Politics, more than\u00a02,800 donors\u00a0have already maxed out to Biden\u2019s campaign since his announcement in late April. Top-dollar donors make up a far higher percentage of Biden\u2019s campaign\u2019s coffers than those of his competitors. In comparison, only 38 percent of the campaign\u2019s funds to date have come from individuals donating less than $200. Such a ratio poses an issue for the former vice president, especially now that his top contributors are prohibited by law from donating again until after he\u2019s secured the nomination.\u00a0David Kochel, the former chief strategist for Jeb Bush\u2019s failed 2016 presidential bid, explained the problem to Politico on Friday. If you don\u2019t have that perpetual, low-dollar fundraising machine, you can\u2019t compete,\u201d Kochel said. \u201cBiden looks like he can\u2019t compete with Warren, Bernie and Buttigieg. How\u2019s he going to compete with Trump?\u201d Despite Biden\u2019s money woes, the former vice president is also facing scrutiny over his son\u2019s shadowy ties to foreign governments, which\u00a0have taken center stage in the battle to impeach President Donald Trump. The controversy started last month when Trump\u00a0suggested\u00a0the Ukrainian government probe Hunter Biden\u2019s role with Burisma Holdings. The younger Biden joined the Ukrainian oil and gas giant in 2014 around the same time his father was appointed to oversee Obama administration policy in the region. As Peter Schweizer, senior contributor at Breitbart News, detailed in his book\u00a0Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends, Hunter Biden secured the position, which paid as much as\u00a0$83,000 per month despite having no background in the energy industry or Ukraine. Hunter Biden\u2019s lack of experience, coupled with his father\u2019s influence over Ukraine,\u00a0immediately raised questions from ethics watchdogs in both the U.S. and Europe about a conflict of interest. Furthering the ethical cloud over the appointment is that it came during the same month that\u00a0Mykola Zlochevsky, Burisma\u2019s founder,\u00a0had his assets\u00a0seized\u00a0in the United Kingdom for suspicion of money laundering. Some have speculated Hunter Biden\u2019s ascension to Burisma\u2019s board was an attempt by Zlochevsky to curry favor with western leaders to prevent further scrutiny of his business dealings. A brazen attempt would not be totally ill-suited for Zlochevsky. The Burisma founder is rumored to be one of eastern Europe\u2019s top oligarchs, a position obtained while serving in the Ukrainian government under former President\u00a0Viktor\u00a0Yanukovych \u2014 a staunch ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin. It was during his tenure in government as Ukraine\u2019s minister of natural resources that Burisma\u00a0received\u00a0its oil and gas licenses. It is in the context of Burisma and Zlochevsky\u2019s legal troubles that Joe Biden\u2019s political influence has raised the most red flags. The former vice president has particularly drawn questions over his conduct in demanding the Ukrainian government fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, in 2016. Biden, who has publicly\u00a0bragged\u00a0about the firing, reportedly threatened to withhold more than one billion dollars in U.S. aid if the Ukrainian government did not remove Shokin. He has claimed the demand came from then-President Barack Obama, who had allegedly lost faith in the prosecutor\u2019s ability to tackle corruption. Unofficially, though, it was known that Shokin was investigating both Burisma and Zlochevsky for public corruption. It is uncertain if the probe extended to Hunter Biden, although Shokin has recently admitted that prior to his ouster he was warned to back off the matter. Regardless of what occurred, Shokin\u2019s successor dropped the investigation into Burisma and Zlochevsky, allowing the oligarch to return to the country after having\u00a0fled\u00a0in 2014. Biden, for his part, has refused to discuss the matter, even lashing out at the media for asking if his son\u2019s work with Burisma posed a conflict of interest during his tenure in the vice presidency. The tactic, however, does not seem to be doing Biden or his campaign any favors. A new poll released on Friday indicates that 57 percent of Americans support the Department of Justice opening an investigation into Hunter Biden\u2019s work abroad. Some of the donors gathered in Philadelphia this weekend, though, saw the issues surrounding Hunter Biden and Ukraine in a different light. Sheila Nix, who once served as chief of staff to Dr. Jill Biden, told the Times\u00a0the former vice president\u2019s struggles were the result of him having to run two campaigns at once. \u201cHe\u2019s running a primary campaign and a general at the same time and I think he\u2019s doing a great job,\u201d Nix said. \u201cIt\u2019s a little unprecedented having to do both at the same time.\u201d",

            "content": " Naturally, the outlet also attacks President Trump over his own Vietnam-era deferment, but comparing Trump to Biden in this regard, as you will see, is like comparing a gun to a tomato. According the report, after he graduated college in 1968, Biden became eligible for the draft, which could have landed him in combat in Vietnam. What saved him, what earned him a 1-Y draft deferment, was asthma\u2026 Asthma, y\u2019all. Asthma. Don\u2019t get me wrong, asthma can be debilitating. Chronic asthma is the worst; it can disable a person. If Biden legitimately suffered a serious asthma problem, his draft deferment is perfectly legitimate. Here\u2019s the problem, though\u2026 While Biden was scoring a deferment for \u201casthma as a teenager,\u201d he was \u2014 get this \u2014 also scoring touchdowns as a teenager. Biden played football in high school and once went so far as to lie about playing football for the University of Delaware \u2014 even though he didn\u2019t, but Biden is the kind of liar who lies about such things. What\u2019s more, InsideSources points out that in his autobiography, Biden makes no mention of asthma, but brags about being \u201cactive in intramural sports\u201d while in college, and \u201crecounts an active childhood [and] football exploits in high school.\u201d Worse still, during one summer home from college, as Biden himself has admitted, he worked as a lifeguard, which requires vigorous health in order to pass that test, including a very healthy set of lungs. And then there\u2019s this: One incident from that summer stands out: How Biden had to wrap a six-foot length of metal chain around his arm to face off against a knife-wielding local tough who went by the name \u201cCorn Pop.\u201d \u201cYou might cut me, Corn Pop, but I\u2019m going to wrap this chain around your head before you do,\u201d Biden told him. Strong words, but he was a healthy, high school football player who could back them up. Biden and Corn Pop resolved their differences without violence and, according to Biden, became poolside friends. Just six years later, at the height of the fighting in Vietnam, that same poolside athlete avoided mandatory military service due to \u201casthma as a teenager.\u201d \u2026\u201dasthma as a teenager.\u201d Yep, healthy enough to play football and qualify as a lifeguard, which is no easy task, but still 1-Y when swimming is one of the most strenuous exercises around. Trump haters can laugh all they want at Trump\u2019s \u201cbone spurs,\u201d the reason behind his 1-Y classification, but snickers and cheap shots don\u2019t contradict a bone spur diagnosis. It\u2019s not like Trump was out running marathons at the time. But there was Slow Joe playing football in high school, playing even more sports in college, and qualifying as a lifeguard, all while claiming to suffer the debilitating asthma that meant someone else would have to take his place in Vietnam. Back in 2008, while he was running for vice president, it was reported that Biden received a total of\u00a0five deferments for asthma. Naturally, the same media that crucified then-Vice President Dick Cheney for his five deferments didn\u2019t care about Biden\u2019s deferments. And we all know why: The media were desperate to make Obama president. After all, why would a media that didn\u2019t care about Obama\u2019s 20 years in a racist church, his associations with domestic terrorists and Louis Farrakhan, care about Biden\u2019s asthma? This time will be different. Biden is running for president, the establishment media see a whole bunch of extreme left-wingers they would like to see beat Biden, and since the dark days of 2008 when the fake news media still held all the levers of information, a whole new media infrastructure has been erected. In other words, we have not heard the last of this, not by a long shot.",

That little girl was me. So I will tell you that on this subject, it cannot be an intellectual debate. \u2026 We have to take it seriously.\u201d",

This president on three occasions, three occasions, has invited foreign governments and heads of government to get engaged in trying to alter our elections. The fact is that it is outrageous.

            "author": "John Nolte",
            "content": " So, uhm, what happened to the badass who took on Corn Pop? What happened to the tough guy who was going to beat President Trump like a drum? What happened to the sunglasses and swagger? I\u2019ll tell you what happened\u2026 Joe Biden got old. And I don\u2019t mean number-wise. While Clint Eastwood is still knocking them out of the park at age 89, Joe Biden\u2019s eye is exploding, his dentures are falling out, and now he\u2019s ranting and raving at the refs because he\u2019s losing the game. On Thursday, the far-left New York Times published an op-ed written by Breitbart\u2019s own Peter Schweizer, author of the recent bestseller Secret Empires. In the piece, Schweizer uses Biden and Sen. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) as an example of why Congress must pass reforms closing the \u201cglaring loophole [that] provide political families with an opportunity to effectively \u2018offshore\u2019 corruption and cronyism.\u201d About Biden, Schweizer lays out the devastating facts: As vice president, Joe Biden served as point person on American policy toward China and Ukraine. In both instances, his son Hunter, a businessman, landed deals\u00a0he\u00a0was apparently\u00a0unqualified to\u00a0score save for one thing: his father. In December 2013, Joe and Hunter Biden\u00a0flew aboard Air Force Two to China; less than two weeks after the trip, Hunter\u2019s firm, Rosemont Seneca Partners, which he founded with two other businessmen in June 2013, finalized a deal to open a\u00a0fund, BHR Partners,\u00a0whose largest shareholder is the\u00a0government-run Bank of China, even though\u00a0he had scant background\u00a0in private equity.\u00a0(Representatives of the fund claim that the timing of the deal and the Bidens\u2019 trip to China was coincidental.)\u00a0Thus far, the firm\u00a0has invested about $2.1 billion,\u00a0according to its website. \u2026 With the Russian invasion of Crimea in 2014, Joe Biden became point person in Ukraine as well. That same year, Hunter Biden\u00a0landed a board position\u00a0with the Ukrainian energy giant Burisma Holdings. Despite having no background in energy or Ukraine, the vice president\u2019s son was paid\u00a0as much as\u00a0$50,000 a month, according to financial records. (He left the board in early 2019.) Why would someone with so little experience be able to command such enormous payments? Joe Biden recently claimed, \u201cI have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.\u201d But Hunter Biden admitted to The New Yorker\u00a0that on one occasion, they had in fact discussed his work for Burisma[.] Biden\u2019s response\u2026? He ran out on his front lawn, shook his fist at the sky, and started yelling at the Times. In a letter addressed to Times executive editor Dean Baquet, Biden\u2019s deputy campaign manager and comms director Kate Bedingfield freaked out. Here\u2019s a taste: What was especially troubling about the Times\u2019s active participation in this smear campaign is that prior to its reporting on the subject by Ken Vogel, this conspiracy had been relegated to the likes of Breitbart, Russian propaganda, and another conspiracy theorist, regular Hannity guest John Solomon. \u2026 Despite voluminous work done by the independent press and fact-checkers \u2014 including some by The Times \u2014 to refute the heinous conspiracy theory that Donald Trump attempted to bully Ukraine into propping-up for him, the paper ran an op-ed by none other than Peter Schweizer, making more malicious claims about the Biden family. This leaves us with a critical question: are you truly blind to what you got wrong in 2016, or are you deliberately continuing policies that distort reality for the sake of controversy and the clicks that accompany it? How sad is that? Biden tried to do the same with Facebook and Twitter after the Trump campaign started running ads about Biden and Ukraine. Twitter has so far said nothing. Facebook told Biden to go pound sand, as did the Times, which released a statement defending the Schweizer op-ed. But is this the behavior of a tough guy? Is this the behavior of a man or a mouse \u2014 a mouse with something to hide? If Biden was an actual tough guy, if he still had The Stuff to be president, he wouldn\u2019t be crybabying to the refs to stop the fight and declare him the winner. \u00a0If Biden were the swaggering badass he claims to be, he would be out there fighting, he\u2019d be sticking it right back to Trump. Most importantly, he would come out of hiding to address this scandal head on \u2014 you know, like a man. Nothing proves this Ukraine scandal is the real deal more than Biden\u2019s cowardice when it comes to addressing it. Even if a reporter is able to ask him a question about the ridiculous amount of money his son was paid by a Ukrainian energy company, Biden just freaks out. Instead of answering the question, he acts like the reporter just skipped in front of him in line at the Blue Plate Special \u2014 he starts screaming and crybabying about how the question isn\u2019t fair. Listen, if there were a legitimate reason Hunter Biden was paid $50,000 a month \u2014a month! \u2014 by this company, Biden would have already sat down for an extensive interview to lay it all out, or he would have called a press conference to answer all questions. Instead, he is hiding his son in some undisclosed location, when he should have Hunter doing the interview rounds in defense of his own business practices and honor. But Biden can\u2019t do that because there are no good answers, so the old man has been reduced to a big whiner, and like a spoiled child caught red-handed, he only has one option: temper tantrums where he screams, \u201cNo, you shut up!",

            "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
            "content": " In a three-and-a-half minute YouTube video, Biden cited the August 2017 riots as his primary motivation for running against Trump, presenting a version of events that even a CNN contributor has declared to be fraudulent. After referring to the town\u2019s historic role \u2014 including Thomas Jefferson, a slave owner \u2014 he added,\u00a0\u201cCharlottesville is also home to a defining moment for this nation in the last few years,\u201d followed by footage of a neo-Nazi procession.  Biden noted that the neo-Nazis in Charlottesville were \u201cchanting the same antisemitic bile heard in the \u201930s.\u201d He then added that they were \u201cmet by a courageous group of Americans, and a violent clash ensured.\u201d (Among that \u201ccourageous group of Americans\u201d were left-wing Antifa extremists who specifically came to Charlottesville to cause violence, and whom even Nancy Pelosi later\u00a0condemned after they caused another riot.) Biden then cited the debunked \u201cvery fine people\u201d claim: And that\u2019s when we heard the words of the President of the United States that stunned the world and shocked the conscience of this nation. He said there were, quote, some \u201cvery fine people on both sides.\u201d Very fine people on both sides? With those words, the president of the United States assigned a moral equivalence between those spreading hate, and those with the courage to stand against it. And in that moment, I knew that the threat to this nation was unlike any I had every seen in my lifetime. What Biden said is completely untrue, as the transcript of Trump\u2019s press conference about Charlottesville shows. Trump was referring to protesters against the removal of a statue of Confederate general Robert E. Lee, as well as to non-violent left-wing protesters against racism, and specifically excluded the neo-Nazis from \u201cvery fine people\u201d (emphasis added): REPORTER: The neo-Nazis started this thing. They showed up in Charlottesville. TRUMP: Excuse me, they didn\u2019t put themselves down as neo-Nazis, and you had some very bad people in that group. But you also had people that were very fine people on both sides. You had people in that group \u2013 excuse me, excuse me. I saw the same pictures as you did. You had people in that group that were there to protest the taking down, of to them, a very, very important statue and the renaming of a park from Robert E. Lee to another name. REPORTER: George Washington and Robert E. Lee are not the same. TRUMP: Oh no, George Washington was a slave owner. Was George Washington a slave owner? So will George Washington now lose his status? Are we going to take down \u2013 excuse me. Are we going to take down, are we going to take down statues to George Washington? How about Thomas Jefferson? What do you think of Thomas Jefferson? You like him? Okay, good. Are we going to take down his statue? He was a major slave owner. Are we going to take down his statue? You know what? It\u2019s fine, you\u2019re changing history, you\u2019re changing culture, and you had people \u2013 and I\u2019m not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists, because they should be condemned totally \u2013 but you had many people in that group other than neo-Nazis and white nationalists, okay? And the press has treated them absolutely unfairly. Now, in the other group also, you had some fine people, but you also had troublemakers and you see them come with the black outfits and with the helmets and with the baseball bats \u2013 you had a lot of bad people in the other group too. Ironically, Biden has his own record of racism to confront. CNN recently exposed how Biden courted the support of segregationists in the 1970s in a campaign to resist \u201cbusing,\u201d the mandatory radical integration of schools. In 2007, Biden infamously called Barack Obama \u201cthe first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy\u201d when commenting on his candidacy (long before being invited to join the ticket). In 2012, on the campaign trail, he told a largely black audience that Republicans wanted \u201cto put y\u2019all back in chains.\u201d And since then, Biden has joined other Democrats in courting the support of racist and antisemite Al Sharpton. Biden continued his video by declaring: \u201cIf we give Donald Trump eight years in the White House, he will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation, who we are, and I cannot stand by and watch that happen.\u201d He also said Trump threatened \u201cour very democracy,\u201d an apparent reference to another recently-debunked hoax \u2014 namely, the false claim that Trump colluded with Russian efforts to interfere with the 2016 presidential election. The former vice president apparently planned to launch his campaign directly in Charlottesville this week, but local leaders objected because \u201csome residents [were] unhappy about the scene a tragedy the city would prefer to forget being used as a campaign launch backdrop,\u201d the\u00a0Washington Examiner reported. Some also \u201cviewed the move as disrespectful and capitalizing on the death of activist Heather Heyer, 32,\u201d who was murdered by a neo-Nazi there. It is unclear why Biden chose to run on a divisive racial hoax, even one that remains dogma among many on the left. Biden may feel vulnerable in a Democratic Party now dominated by identity politics. Indeed, the Associated Press reported Thursday that some \u201cwomen of color\u201d were \u201cfrustrated\u201d by his candidacy. Nevertheless, the fact that Biden is running on an inflammatory, fearful hoax invites questions about who is really trying to divide Americans. ",

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Bernie Sanders (D-VT), traded barbs about who was best prepared to be commander in chief and what sort of vision was required to defeat President Donald Trump. Warren, in particular, cited her tenure, pushing for creation of the CFPB as proof she knew how to use \u201cexecutive authority\u201d to further her political agenda. Biden, who earlier in the debate claimed to be the \u201conly\u00a0one on this stage that has gotten anything really big done,\u201d attempted to counter the argument by highlighting his own role in the creation of the CFPB. \u201cI agreed with the great job she did, and I went on the floor and got you votes. I got votes for that bill. I convinced people to vote for it,\u201d the former vice president said. \u201cSo let\u2019s get those things straight, too.\u201d Despite the rhetoric, however, official scheduling records from the Obama-era White House dispute Biden\u2019s claims of having rallied support for the legislation.\u00a0In fact, as the Intercept has\u00a0reported,\u00a0on the day of the passage of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act\u2014which created the CFPB\u2014the former vice president\u2019s schedule notes he was not on the floor of the U.S. Senate. Records show that on the day the bill passed by a vote of 60-39, Biden only had one meeting with a member of Congress\u2019s upper chamber, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC). It is unlikely, though, that Biden was attempting to sway Graham\u2019s vote on the bill because, at the time, the senator was one of the bill\u2019s leading opponents. Biden\u2019s schedule for the rest of the day shows meetings regarding issues such as Iraq and the then-stimulus spending program, but nothing about Dodd-Frank:  As the Intercept noted, not only is there scant evidence to back up Biden\u2019s claim of going to the \u201cfloor,\u201d but several of those involved in Dodd-Frank\u2019s passage also have no recollection of the former vice president playing a role. Former Rep. Brad Miller (D-NC), who helped author the bill, even went so far as to say he \u201ccannot recall ever hearing\u201d Biden\u2019s name mentioned as Dodd-Frank moved through Congress:  This is not the first time the former vice president has inflated his role in a particular event for political gain. As Breitbart News reported in August, Biden has repeatedly inflated his role in the civil rights movement of the 1960s.",

It\u2019s very swampy. My question is this: Al Franken had to go away for the Democrats. Because they said, well, we have to be like Caesar\u2019s wife on the #MeToo issue. We can\u2019t have any tainting on that, so that the Republicans can\u2019t say, oh, you guys are bad on that too. Doesn\u2019t the same apply to Ukraine and Joe Biden?\u201d Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter\u00a0@IanHanchett",

Biden defended his son Hunter Biden serving on the board of a Ukrainian energy company but failed to differentiate him from his deceased son Beau Biden, who was the Attorney General of Delaware. \u201cEven when my son was the attorney general of the state of Delaware, we never discussed anything so that there would be no potential conflict,\u201d he said, without naming Beau. 4.

Biden vague on the issue of being vague Biden criticized his Democrat rival Elizabeth Warren for being vague, but ended up sounding more vague in the process. \u201cPart of that requires you not being vague,\u201d Biden said. When asked to explain what he meant, he meandered on for several seconds talking about the different costs of healthcare. 7. Age is wisdom When asked about his age, Biden said that his advanced age gave him \u201cwisdom\u201d to be president. \u201cOne of the reasons I\u2019m running is because of my age and my experience,\u201d he said. \u201cWith it comes wisdom.

Biden first used the phrase in late September when he snapped at a reporter who asked about President Donald Trump suggesting Ukraine look into allegations of corruption against him and his son, Hunter Biden. \u201cI know Trump deserves to be investigated. He\u2019s violating every basic norm of a president,\u201d Biden told Fox News Channel correspondent Peter Doocy. \u201cYou should be asking him the question, why is he on the phone with a foreign leader trying to intimidate a foreign leader,\u201d the former vice president continued. \u201cTrump is doing this because he knows I will beat him like a drum. He\u2019s using abuse of power and every element of the presidency to try to do something to smear me.\u201d \u201cAsk the right questions,\u201d he then demanded of Doocy. During Tuesday evening\u2019s Democrat presidential debate, Biden once again made the pledge to beat President Trump \u201clike a drum\u201d while defending Hunter against accusations of\u00a0nepotism and corruption related to his son\u2019s work in Ukraine and China. \u201cMy son did nothing wrong.

He doesn\u2019t want me to be the candidate. If I\u2019m the candidate, he knows I will beat him like a drum.\u201d While the t-shirt demonstrates the Biden campaign is confident it will win the Democrat party, it still has to fend off the insurgent campaign of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), who is leading the former vice president in several statewide polls. Although the Biden has latched onto the phrase, it appears Sen.\u00a0Lindsey Graham (R-SC) used it in 2016 when (erroneously) predicting what then-Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton would do to then-candidate Trump in the general election. \u201cI\u2019d hold my nose and vote for him but we\u2019d get killed.

The damage inflicted by President Trump\u2019s naivet\u00e9, egotism, false equivalence, and sympathy for autocrats is difficult to calculate. But it is clear that the summit in Helsinki was a tragic mistake,\u201d Sen. McCain\u2019s statement begins.\u00a0\u201cPresident Trump proved not only unable, but unwilling to stand up to Putin. He and Putin seemed to be speaking from the same script as the president made a conscious choice to defend a tyrant against the fair questions of a free press, and to grant Putin an uncontested platform to spew propaganda and lies to the world.\u201d It is tempting to describe the press conference as a pathetic rout \u2013 as an illustration of the perils of under-preparation and inexperience. But these were not the errant tweets of a novice politician. These were the deliberate choices of a president who seems determined to realize his delusions of a warm relationship with Putin\u2019s regime without any regard for the true nature of his rule, his violent disregard for the sovereignty of his neighbors, his complicity in the slaughter of the Syrian people, his violation of international treaties, and his assault on democratic institutions throughout the world. McCain highlighted the coziness between President Trump and his Russian counterpoint in contrast to his tough talk towards the United States\u2019 European allies. Last Wednesday, President Trump scolded Germany during a breakfast with NATO officials in Brussel over Berlin\u2019s support\u00a0of a Baltic Sea gas pipeline deal with the Kremlin, describing Europe\u2019s largest economy as a \u201ccaptive of Russians.\u201d In an interview with British tabloid The Sun,\u00a0President\u00a0 Trump predicted the British government\u2019s proposed watered down Brexit strategy \u201cwill probably kill\u201d hopes of a bilateral trade agreement with the United States. Ahead of his high-stakes meeting with Putin, President Trump branded the European Union a \u201cfoe\u201d in respect to trade. \u201cComing close on the heels of President Trump\u2019s bombastic and erratic conduct towards our closest friends and allies in Brussels and Britain, today\u2019s press conference marks a recent low point in the history of the American Presidency,\u201d the statement continues.\u201d That the president was attended in Helsinki by a team of competent and patriotic advisors makes his blunders and capitulations all the more painful and inexplicable.\u201d McCain concluded his blistering statement by accusing Trump of failing to uphold American values abroad, something he claims the president has failed to do since winning the White House. \u201cNo prior president has ever abased himself more abjectly before a tyrant. Not only did President Trump fail to speak the truth about an adversary; but speaking for America to the world, our president failed to defend all that makes us who we are\u2014a republic of free people dedicated to the cause of liberty at home and abroad. American presidents must be the champions of that cause if it is to succeed,\u201d McCain said. \u201cAmericans are waiting and hoping for President Trump to embrace that sacred responsibility. One can only hope they are not waiting totally in vain.\u201d Presidents Trump and Putin vowed a fresh start to troubled relations between the world\u2019s greatest nuclear powers at their summit, as the American leader rejected a chance to condemn Moscow\u2019s alleged manipulation of U.S. elections. Standing alongside Putin at a joint news conference, President Trump said he had \u201cspent a great deal of time talking about\u201d election meddling, without going into detail or explicitly condemning any interference\u00a0after 12 Russian agents were indicted in the United States. When pressed about alleged meddling, President Trump stressed that Putin had delivered a \u201cpowerful\u201d denial of any Russian vote meddling and said the investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller had been a \u201cdisaster\u201d for the United States. President Trump again denied any collusion between his campaign and the Kremlin, while Putin insisted: \u201cThe Russian state has never interfered and is not planning to interfere in the USA\u2019s internal affairs.\u201d The\u00a0Agence France-Presse contributed to this report.",

            "content": " The Health Care Freedom Act failed 49-51. Sens. John McCain (R-AZ), Susan Collins (R-ME), and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) voted against the bill. Sens. McCain and Murkowski pledged repeatedly to repeal Obamacare, whereas Sen. Collins consistently voted against any Obamacare repeal proposed by the Senate. Not only have these Sens. McCain and Murkowski\u00a0voted to repeal Obamacare, they publicly pledged to do so on the campaign trail and in the halls of the Senate. Here are two instances when\u00a0these senators promised to repeal Obamacare: The Health Care Freedom Act would have repealed Obamacare\u2019s individual and employer mandate, provided states flexibility on\u00a0Obamacare insurance regulations through waivers, increased Health Savings Account (HSA) contribution limits, repealed Obamacare\u2019s medical device tax, and defunded Planned Parenthood for one year. The Senate healthcare reform process already traversed a rocky path. The Senate\u2019s motion to start debating healthcare legislation barely passed through the upper chamber at 51-50. Vice President Mike Pence had to break the tie after Sens. Susan Collins (R-ME) and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK)\u00a0voted\u00a0against starting the debate in Congress. The Senate leadership failed to pass its healthcare bill, the Better Care Reconciliation Act (BCRA), and Senator Rand Paul\u2019s (R-KY) clean repeal bill failed in the Senate after moderate Republicans\u00a0shot down\u00a0the legislation. Vice President Mike Pence arrived shortly before the Senate voted on the Health Care Freedom Act.  Vice President Mike Pence was present at the Senate for the vote. The Senate shot down Sen. Patty Murray\u2019s (D-WA) motion to recommit the bill to the Senate Health, Labor, Education, and Pensions (HELP) committee, where Democrats argue that they can negotiate a bipartisan deal on health care with Republicans. The Senate failed to pass the Health Care Freedom Act. Senate Republicans needed at least 50 votes and Vice President Mike Pence to pass the bill through the upper chamber. Congressional leaders sought to send the Health Care Freedom Act to the House and the Senate, where both chambers could\u00a0compromise\u00a0on a unified bill through a conference committee. After which, both houses would have to pass the unified bill and then send the bill to President Donald Trump to sign. President Donald Trump cheered on the Senate Republicans before the vote, urging them to finally pass a health care reform bill after seven years.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell addressed the Senate Friday morning. McConnell regretfully said: Mr. President this is clearly a disappointing moment. From skyrocketing costs, to plummeting choices, and collapsing markets, our constituents have suffered an awful lot under Obamacare. We thought they deserved better, it\u2019s why I and many of my colleagues did as we promised and voted to repeal this failed law. We told our constituents we would vote that way, but when the moment came most of us did. We kept our commitments, we worked hard, and everyone on this side can attest to the fact that we worked really hard. We tried to develop a consensus for a way forward and I want to thank everyone in our conference for the endless amount of time that they spent trying to achieve a consensus to go forward. I also want to thank the President and the Vice President, both of them could not have been more involved and more helpful. So yes, this is a disappointment. A disappointment indeed. McConnell then challenged the Democrats to come up with a solution to the nation\u2019s health care crisis brought on\u00a0by Obamacare. McConnell asked, \u201cNow I think it is appropriate to ask what are their ideas?\u201d \u201cNow it\u2019s time for the other side to put their ideas forward and we\u2019ll see how the American people feel about their ideas,\u201d the Majority Leader added. McConnell concluded, \u201cMy only regret, our only regret tonight, that we didn\u2019t achieve what we had hoped to accomplish. I think the American people are going to regret that we couldn\u2019t find a better way forward.\u201d  ",

            "content": " The amendment proposed by New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen \u2014 and supported by McCain \u2014 will increase the number of Afghan Special Immigrant Visas for people who have aided U.S. soldiers as interpreters or translators. The number of visas will rise from 7,000 to 11,000, and each visa holder can bring spouses and their children to the United States. \u201cIt is time for the Senate to stop treating U.S. immigration policy like a Christmas tree that they can simply add more baubles to on a whim,\u201d a press release from NumbersUSA sent to Senate offices Monday read. \u201cAmericans have to pay for each of those baubles \u2014 through higher taxes, fewer jobs, lower wages, and, tragically, higher health care costs for soldiers and their families.\u201d McCain\u2019s office declined to respond to queries from Breitbart News. Congress cut healthcare benefits to veterans in the 2016 budget by increasing pharmacy co-pays \u2014 using some of those savings to fund an expansion of the Afghan Special Immigrant Visas program, according to The Daily Caller News Foundation. The money could have been taken from other spending accounts, such as programs at the State Department. Backers of the amendment plan to do more of the same, says NumbersUSA: \u201cOnce again, shamefully, the proposed pay-for apparently will be on the backs of our soldiers and their families in higher-priced health care.\u201d The\u00a0war in violent, tribal, Third World Afghanistan has cost American taxpayers $1.6 trillion\u00a0since 9/11, according to a 2014 Congressional Research Office estimate. It has taken the lives of over 2,300 U.S. soldiers, on top of over\u00a020,000 U.S.\u00a0soldiers wounded or maimed. But Republicans and Democrats have united to pile more costs onto taxpayers and military families. NumbersUSA explained the wide range of taxpayer-funded programs the Afghanis are eligible to receive. \u201cRecipients are entitled to every benefit to which refugees are entitled, including travel loans, eight months of refugee cash and medical assistance, social services, up to five years of job training, job placement, and English classes,\u201d along with employment authorization and a Social Security number. The SSN allows them to claim\u00a0Earned Income Tax Credits and Additional Child Tax Credits. Every child born on U.S. soil is\u00a0automatically awarded U.S. citizenship, thanks to liberal Supreme Court Justice William Brennan\u2019s 1982 footnote in Plyler v. Doe.\u00a0They, in turn, can sponsor \u201crelatives\u201d\u00a0to join them in the U.S., whether or not American communities prefer to have impoverished, tribal, devout Muslims resettled en-masse into their neighborhoods. This is\u00a0thanks to the 51-year long\u00a0chain migration\u00a0tradition of giving migrants control over U.S. immigration policy, successfully advocated by Democratic Sen. Ted Kennedy and his\u00a0Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965. In addition, they are eligible for federal entitlement programs and other benefits, including but not limited to: It\u2019s a remarkable bargain for interpreters who aided the U.S. in their native country. The\u00a0Afghan Special Immigrant Visas program was created in 2009 and continued to grow as modifications were made. Despite its expansion, thousands of visas still remain unclaimed, NumbersUSA says: As of April 7 of this year, the Department of State still had 3,635 visas available to issue. Notably, the visa cap applies only to principal alien applicants \u2014 with an uncapped number going to each applicant\u2019s spouse and unmarried children under the age of 21. So in FY 2014, while 3,441 visas were issued to principal aliens, 5,666 were issued to their dependents. In FY 2015, 2,301 were issued to principals, and 4,411 to dependents. As of December 31 of 2015, 1,367 had been issued to principals and 2,942 to their dependents. But there\u2019s still years left to apply: The McCain-backed amendment requires a report \u201cdetailing a strategy for bringing the program to a responsible end\u201d should be written by December 31, 2019 \u2014 or \u201csoon thereafter,\u201d depending on continued U.S. military involvement. President Obama announced in\u00a0October 2015\u00a0that he would keep U.S. troops in Afghanistan until the end of his term in 2017. ",

McCain has been one of President Donald Trump\u2019s most vocal Republican critics, given Trump\u2019s infamous campaign-trail insult of his Vietnam War captivity. The senator wrote in his book Restless Wave that today\u2019s GOP is on the wrong side of the immigration debate. \u201cRight now, Republicans are on the wrong side of that progress,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnd if we want to retain our competitiveness in the fastest-growing communities in the country we\u2019ll stop letting the zealots drive the debate, and fix the problems that [give] them their soapbox.\u201d McCain, who has said America-First conservatives make up a mere sliver of the Party, also wrote the faction must be \u201cconfronted before their noxious views spread further and damage for generations the reputation of the Republican Party.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re still a small fraction in the Republican Party. But they\u2019re the ones getting all the attention right now. They need to be confronted, not ignored or winked at or quietly dismissed as kooks,\u201d the former presidential candidate wrote. \u201cThey need to be confronted before their noxious views spread further and damage for generations the reputation of the Republican Party.\u201d McCain infamously voted twice to protect the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, commonly referred to as Obamacare. Last July, he helped defeat a \u201cskinny\u201d repeal bill 49 to 51 in a dramatic, late-night vote. McCain then went on to vote against the Graham-Cassidy Obamacare repeal bill in September. The ailing Senator\u2019s daughter, Meghan McCain, thanked supporters for their \u201clove and generosity,\u201d over the course of the year.\u00a0\u201cMy family is deeply appreciative of all the love and generosity you have shown us during this past year McCain tweeted. Thank you for all your continued support and prayers. We could not have made it this far without you \u2013 you\u2019ve given us strength to carry on.\u201d",

Russia employed the same tactics it has used to influence elections around the world, from France and Germany to Ukraine, Montenegro, and beyond. Putin\u2019s regime launched cyberattacks and spread disinformation with the goal of sowing chaos and weakening faith in our institutions. And while we have no evidence that these efforts affected the outcome of our election, I fear they succeeded in fueling political discord and dividing us from one another. The latest attacks on the FBI and Department of Justice serve no American interests \u2013 no party\u2019s, no president\u2019s, only Putin\u2019s. The American people deserve to know all of the facts surrounding Russia\u2019s ongoing efforts to subvert our democracy, which is why Special Counsel Mueller\u2019s investigation must proceed unimpeded. Our nation\u2019s elected officials, including the president, must stop looking at this investigation through the warped lens of politics and manufacturing partisan sideshows. If we continue to undermine our own rule of law, we are doing Putin\u2019s job for him. The White House and the House Intelligence Committee\u00a0released the FISA memo on Friday. Last December it was revealed that it McCain who passed the Steele dossier to former FBI Director James Comey. McCain met with Andrew Wood in Halifax, Canada at the Halifax Security Forum in Canada in November 2016, and they discussed the dossier. McCain had his associate David Kramer travel to London to meet with Steele and get briefed on the dossier. They arranged to get a hard copy of the dossier to McCain, and he gave it to Comey. The memo describes how senior Department of Justice (DOJ) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) officials used the unverified Trump dossier to obtain a surveillance warrant\u00a0on Trump campaign staffer Carter Page. The memo also details how those senior officials in the DOJ and the FBI misled the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court on how the Trump dossier was actually opposition research funded by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee\u00a0(DNC).",

            "author": "Matthew Boyle",
            "content": "  Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) has endured brutal criticism\u2013media fact checkers, reporters, and political figures have shredded him\u2013for questioning just who McCain posed with. But a closer look at the situation tells perhaps a different story than McCain\u2019s office or the mainstream media have pushed. The criticism of McCain centers around how the Arizona senator met with Syrian rebel leaders in May 2013 when he visited the country. McCain posed for photographs with those people, and since then rumors have sprouted up across the Internet that he met with ISIS or some other terrorist kidnappers or nefarious forces. \u201cThe people in the pictures with Senator McCain in Syria included General Salim Idris, then-Chief of Staff of the Supreme Military Command of the Free Syrian Army (FSA), Mouaz Moustafa, the Executive Director of the DC-based Syrian Emergency Task Force (which supports the moderate opposition and helped arrange some of the trip), and fighters and commanders from the Northern Storm Brigade, a FSA-aligned group,\u201d McCain\u2019s spokesman Brian Rogers told Breitbart News. Rogers said that the senator and his team aren\u2019t naming the \u201cfighters and commanders from the Northern Storm Brigade, a FSA-aligned group,\u201d because \u201cISIS actually threatened to kill them all, and we don\u2019t want to put their lives at risk.\u201d Rogers provided Breitbart News with a link to the ISIS threat to those fighters. \u201cISIS targeted the Northern Storm because ISIS considers them apostates and because Northern Storm met with Sen. McCain,\u201d Rogers said. \u201cISIS actually wrote out a statement that accused Northern Storm of treachery for reasons including: \u2018Meeting with U.S. Senator John McCain in the hangar and making a contract with him against the Islamists.\u2019 The statement goes on to demand that Northern Storm surrender and repent to ISIS or be killed.\u201d \u201cISIS actually killed many Northern Storm members, and we\u2019re not going to put them at any further risk by naming them,\u201d Rogers added. But there\u2019s just one problem with McCain\u2019s office\u2019s story. Now, McCain\u2019s team says the senator didn\u2019t meet with any bad figures but declines to name them, for what seems to be a legitimate reason\u2013although those who are publicly leading combat against ISIS and against Bashar Al-Assad\u2019s regime are probably publicly known figures there. Just last year, however, McCain\u2019s office had no clue who the senator met. When allegations surfaced that the senator may have met with terrorists who kidnapped someone, Rogers\u2013McCain\u2019s communications director\u2013went on the record to multiple media outlets to say he didn\u2019t know who he was meeting with, and if he did meet with kidnapper terrorists, that would be regrettable. \u201cNone of the individuals the senator planned to meet with was named Mohamad Nour or Abu Ibrahim,\u201d Rogers told CNN in late May 2013, right after the trip. \u201cA number of other Syrian commanders joined the meeting, but none of them identified himself as Mohamad Nour or Abu Ibrahim.\u201d Rogers added later in his statement to CNN that he and the senator did not know who he was meeting with. \u201cA number of the Syrians who greeted Senator McCain upon his arrival in Syria asked to take pictures with him, and, as always, the senator complied,\u201d Rogers said. \u201cIf the individual photographed with Senator McCain is in fact Mohamed Nour, that is regrettable. But it would be ludicrous to suggest that the Senator in any way condones the kidnapping of Lebanese Shia pilgrims or has any communication with those responsible. Senator McCain condemns such heinous actions in the strongest possible terms.\u201d Of course it\u2019s ludicrous to suggest that McCain would condone the act of kidnapping, and nobody serious is suggesting that. The point many critics of McCain\u2019s policies\u2013including Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY)\u2013are making is that Americans have no way of knowing which team any one of these figures is on. \u201cHere\u2019s the problem,\u201d Paul said in an interview with The Daily Beast this week. \u201cHe [McCain] did meet with ISIS, and had his picture taken, and didn\u2019t know it was happening at the time. That really shows you the quandary of determining who are the moderates and who aren\u2019t. If you don\u2019t speak Arabic, and you don\u2019t understand that some people will lie to you\u2013I really think that we don\u2019t have a good handle on who are the moderates and who aren\u2019t, and I think the objective evidence is that the ones doing most of the fighting and most of the battles among the rebels in Syria are the radical Islamists.\u201d Paul has been roundly criticized for the remarks, starting with the publication he made them to. The Daily Beast\u2019s Olivia Nuzzi wrote that Paul\u2019s statement means he \u201crepeated a thoroughly debunked rumor.\u201d The Washington Post\u2019s fact-checker Glenn Kessler gave Paul \u201cFour Pinocchios,\u201d its highest rating of dishonesty, for the statement. Kessler wrote that this story is one where he regrets \u201cwe are limited to just Four Pinocchios,\u201d because there is \u201czero evidence that any of the men that McCain met with in Syria are linked to the Islamic State.\u201d Despite this pile-on by the media and political establishment, Paul has a serious point here, though. McCain really didn\u2019t know who he was meeting with, and even if they were the supposedly \u201cmoderate\u201d Free Syrian Army, who\u2019s to know that they aren\u2019t elements of the Free Syrian Army working alongside ISIS? Patrick Poole, an esteemed national security reporter and expert on radical Islam for PJ Media, has reported that the Free Syrian Army\u2019s commanders have admitted in public to working alongside ISIS. \u201cAs President Obama laid out his \u2018strategy\u2019 last night for dealing with the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), and as bipartisan leadership in Congress pushes to approve as much as $4 billion to arm Syrian \u2018rebels,\u2019 it should be noted that the keystone to his anti-Assad policy \u2014 the \u2018vetted moderate\u2019 Free Syrian Army (FSA) \u2014 is now admitting that they, too, are working with the Islamic State,\u201d Poole wrote on Sept. 10. Poole cites the Lebanese newspaper Daily Star, which quotes a Free Syrian Army brigade commander as saying he is working with the \u201cIslamic State and Jabhat al-Nusra, al-Qaeda\u2019s official Syrian affiliate \u2014 both U.S.-designated terrorist organizations.\u201d Specifically, the quotes Poole pulls are: \u201cWe are collaborating with the Islamic State and the Nusra Front by attacking the Syrian Army\u2019s gatherings in\u2026 Qalamoun,\u201d said Bassel Idriss, the commander of an FSA-aligned rebel brigade. \u201cWe have reached a point where we have to collaborate with anyone against unfairness and injustice,\u201d confirmed Abu Khaled, another FSA commander who lives in Arsal. \u201cLet\u2019s face it: The Nusra Front is the biggest power present right now in Qalamoun and we as FSA would collaborate on any mission they launch as long as it coincides with our values,\u201d he added. In a lengthy floor speech on Thursday, Paul ripped the foreign policy establishment in Washington for assuming that FSA and ISIS are really distinct entities. \u201cAccording to a New York Times report, over a year ago, the CIA began training Syrian rebels in nearby Jordan, thousands of them, along with delivering arms and ammunition,\u201d Paul said, according to a transcript of the speech provided to Breitbart News by his office. \u201cNew York Times reports also detailed the huge arms and financial transfers from Quatar to the Syrian rebels, beginning as early as 2011. No one really knows where that all ended up: Jane\u2019s Terrorism Center noted, the transfer of Quatari arms to targeted groups has the same practical effect as shipping them to Al Nusra, a violent jihadist force. The New York Times further detailed that Sudan has provided anti-tank missiles and other arms.\u201d Shortly after those comments, Paul said that America can\u2019t be sure\u2013since supposedly \u201cvetted moderates\u201d are working alongside ISIS\u2013who any of them are. He added that even if some might be loyal now, they could change their allegiances in a heartbeat\u2013saying that some officials estimate that more than half of FSA forces have defected to ISIS. \u201cSo the idea that these rebels haven\u2019t been armed before is ludicrous on it\u2019s face. It is also ludicrous to believe that we know where all of the money, arms and ammunition will end up, or who will end up benefiting from these shipments. Why? Because we don\u2019t know for sure who the groups all are,\u201d Paul said. \u201cEven when we think we do, loyalties shift and groups become amorphous, with alleged moderates lining up with jihadists. And finally, moderate groups have often sold their weapons or had them seized by the jihadist elements led by ISIS.\u201d McCain\u2019s office, however, fiercely defends the notion that FSA is not working alongside ISIS. \u201cAlso, these reports of some kind of \u2018truce\u2019 between the FSA and ISIS have also been debunked,\u201d Rogers, McCain\u2019s spokesman, told Breitbart News\u2013citing a piece from the Daily Beast to back up his claims. \u201cWhile there have been brief cease-fires between the groups to collect bodies of those killed during fighting, as this Josh Rogin article makes clear, there\u2019s no \u2018truce\u2019 between FSA and ISIS.\u201d And maybe there is no formal \u201ctruce\u201d between FSA and ISIS, but the reports of mass defections and quotes from FSA leaders and brigade commanders on record saying they are working with ISIS makes this much more complicated than the clear cut-and-dry issue the mainstream media have made it so as to rip Paul. When McCain\u2019s office won\u2019t name who exactly he met with, who exactly he\u2019s photographed with\u2013after last year admitting in public they didn\u2019t know who he greeted in Syria\u2013are we supposed to just take his word for it that\u00a0some of those FSA leaders aren\u2019t now working with ISIS\u2013or maybe have outright joined ISIS, like that other FSA commander Poole and the\u00a0Daily Star quote?

The comments are the harshest yet from the GOP side of the aisle and come as some Democrats are openly calling for President Donald Trump impeachment over the \u201cComey Memo.\u201d Rep. Al Green (D-TX) did so on the House floor Tuesday morning. McCain\u2019s comments add to rumblings among certain other Republicans on Capitol Hill who have signaled their willingness to abandon Trump over the allegations in Comey\u2019s memo and reports of discussion of classified information with Russian diplomats. The Hill reported Wednesday that the Comey Memo was causing more GOPers to try and detach their legislative agenda from the president. McCain has been a proponent of the Russian election-influence narrative, and a central figure in Senate hearings on the issue. He expressed his dismay\u00a0over President Trump\u2019s decision to dismiss Comey last week. The six-term senator and 2008 GOP nominee for president has been a pillar of anti-Trump Republicans since shortly after Trump\u2019s announcement in 2015 when the two became embroiled in a controversy over Trump\u2019s comment on McCain\u2019s time as a Vietnam POW. \u201cNever Trump\u201d commentator Bill Kristol even called for McCain to intervene as an independent candidate on the eve of the 2016 Republican National Convention. McCain\u2019s opposition to Russia\u2019s foreign policy ambitions, dating back to the Cold War era, has played a central role in his political career. In his 2008 bid for the presidency, McCain famously wrote that \u201cwe are all Georgians\u201d in advocating a stronger American response to the contemporaneous Russian military intervention in the small Caucasian state. He similarly called for the United States to provide military aid to Ukraine in 2014. Although he stopped well short of calling for impeachment or resignation, the ultimate fate of President Richard Nixon in the 1970s scandal he referenced, McCain\u2019s appraisal of the situation fits neatly into an emerging mainstream media narrative that Trump\u2019s actions rise to an equivalent level.",

            "author": "John Hayward",
            "content": " Sworn Donald Trump enemy John McCain admitted Wednesday that he passed the dossier of claims of a Russian blackmail plot against the president-elect. The Arizona senator issued a public statement amid mounting questions of his exact role in the affair \u2013 and how a document riddled with errors and unverifiable claims came to be published. \u2018Late last year, I received sensitive information that has since been made public,\u2019 he said. \u2018Upon examination of the contents, and unable to make a judgment about their accuracy, I delivered the information to the Director of the FBI. \u2018That has been the extent of my contact with the FBI or any other government agency regarding this issue.\u2019 But the Daily Mail \u2013 which, it should be noted, seems to like McCain about as much as McCain likes Trump \u2013 argues that the \u201c2008 Republican loser\u201d might have been \u201cfar more intimately involved than that.\u201d Watergate legend Carl Bernstein is quoted telling CNN that McCain got the dossier from the former British ambassador to Moscow, who in turn got it from that mysterious \u201cformer British MI6 agent who was hired from a political opposition research firm in Washington\u201d that we\u2019ve been hearing so much about lately. Isn\u2019t this precisely the kind of political influence operation our media spent the past few weeks freaking out about, when they thought Russia ran one against Hillary Clinton? It\u2019s also a perfect example of what the establishment media really means when it complains about \u201cfake news.\u201d They\u2019re very protective of their ability to shut down stories. They hate it when people who aren\u2019t credentialed journalists use the Internet and talk radio to generate interest in something the media earlier deemed a non-story. If that interest grows intense enough, establishment media can find itself dragged back into covering something it didn\u2019t want to cover. That\u2019s what happened here: against its political interests, the establishment media didn\u2019t think this bundle of opposition research was solid enough to merit coverage, but now it\u2019s been pushed into the spotlight and they\u2019re all talking about it. The new White House Chief of Staff, Reince Priebus, denigrated the source of what he called \u201cphony-baloney garbage\u201d perfectly on Wednesday morning: \u201cI\u2019ve read most of it. But what I can tell you is that even the New York Times last night refused to publish this document, which is not an intelligence document. Keep in mind, this is some retired guy somewhere out in the world acting like Ian Fleming, apparently trying to maybe write a fiction novel.\u201d On Wednesday morning, we learned that a key figure in the dirty dossier, Trump counsel Michael Cohen, has produced convincing documentary evidence that he did not travel to Prague to meet with Kremlin officials, as the anti-Trump oppo dump alleges. We\u2019re now told that it was some other Michael Cohen in Prague. It\u2019s all starting to sound like a script written by the Coen Brothers. Also on Wednesday, NBC News revealed that the dossier, which contains \u201cobvious errors,\u201d was not actually presented to Trump by the intelligence community, as early reporting breathlessly asserted. Instead, Trump was given an oral briefing based on a two-page summary\u2026 as an example of what \u201cdisinformation\u201d looks like. \u201cIntel and law enforcement officials agree that none of the investigations have found any conclusive or direct link between Trump and the Russian government period,\u201d the senior official said. According to the official, the two-page summary about the unsubstantiated material made available to the briefers was to provide context, should they need it, to draw the distinction for Trump between analyzed intelligence and unvetted \u201cdisinformation.\u201d The briefers also had available to them unvetted \u201cdisinformation\u201d about the Clinton Foundation, although that was not shared with Trump. (Emphasis mine, but NBC really should have emphasized it, or made it the lede for their story.) But Buzzfeed threw the full contents of that dossier out the public and said, Top media organizations and intelligence agencies couldn\u2019t verify any of this stuff after months of hard work, but you folks can decide for yourselves! No doubt local Rotary clubs are putting together top-shelf intelligence bureaus and developing contacts in Moscow at this very moment. In his press conference on Wednesday morning, Trump thanked news organizations which refused to publish the salacious material when it was shopped to them during the campaign. \u201cI do have to say that, and I must say that I want to thank a lot of the news organizations here today because they looked at that nonsense that was released by maybe the intelligence agencies, who knows, but maybe the intelligence agencies, which would be a tremendous blot on their record if they in fact did that, a tremendous blot. Because a thing like that should have never been written, and it should certainly never have been released,\u201d he said. Senator McCain has absolutely no excuse for pushing this tripe to the FBI. He\u2019s a senior senator with intelligence experience. He knew the sources for the most explosive \u201crevelations\u201d were extremely dodgy. He has always been\u00a0very chummy with the press, so he would have known they didn\u2019t think this material was solid enough to even allude to it during the election, no matter how badly they wanted Hillary Clinton to win \u2013 not even when they believed the FBI investigation of Clinton was severely damaging her image. To borrow a phrase from President-elect Trump, there are plenty of tremendous blots to go around today.",

            "author": "Tony Lee",
            "content": " \u201cRight now, Republicans are on the wrong side of that progress,\u201d McCain reportedly writes in his new book, Restless Wave, according to a Wednesday report in the Guardian. \u201cAnd if we want to retain our competitiveness in the fastest-growing communities in the country we\u2019ll stop letting the zealots drive the debate, and fix the problems that [give] them their soapbox.\u201d McCain also urges Republicans to reject those who think America is being \u201ccontaminated by the customs of non-European immigrants.\u201d With the help of his establishment collaborator Mark Salter, McCain repeats the same GOP establishment talking points about how Republicans cannot win elections, minorities, and swing voters without supporting amnesty for nearly all illegal immigrants in a comprehensive immigration package. After the 2012 election, the Republican National Committee produced its infamous and incompetent \u201cautopsy\u201d report in which the only policy solution was amnesty for illegal immigrants. In 2016, though, Trump made illegal immigration a centerpiece of his economic nationalist campaign. Trump not only won the presidency, but he did so while getting more support among people of color than establishment darling Willard \u201cMitt\u201d Romney received four years before. McCain also claimed that America-first Republicans only make up a \u201csmall fraction in the Republican Party.\u201d Perhaps McCain was confusing establishment Republicans in the permanent political class with actual voters that they have shown to have absolutely nothing but contempt and disdain for, especially when it comes to immigration and strong borders. \u201cThey\u2019re still a small fraction in the Republican Party. But they\u2019re the ones getting all the attention right now. They need to be confronted, not ignored or winked at or quietly dismissed as kooks,\u201d McCain writes. \u201cThey need to be confronted before their noxious views spread further and damage for generations the reputation of the Republican Party.\u201d As Breitbart\u2019s John Binder has noted, polling has shown that immigration is one of the most important issue for GOP primary voters, a vast majority of whom also want to also cut legal immigration. Immigration has always been one of the most powerful issues for the GOP base. McCain found that out during his 2008 presidential run when his primary campaign nearly went bankrupt after he teamed up with the late Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-MA) to push comprehensive amnesty legislation, which then-President George W. Bush also backed. At one point, McCain had to carry his own bags and fly in coach class to New Hampshire. His campaign\u2019s dire financial situation ultimately resulted in McCain being burdened with incompetent advisers who were in over their heads\u2014like Nicolle Wallace and Steve Schmidt\u2014managing his campaign, which was unable to rebut the barrage of ads the Obama campaign unleashed on McCain in key swing states like Virginia. McCain, though, has been insistent that Congress try again to pass a \u201cGang of Eight\u201d amnesty bill, telling the Arizona Republic last year it is one of the main issues he would like to see resolved.",

            "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
            "content": " McCain was born on a U.S. Navy base in Panama in 1936, the son and grandson of career Navy officers. He graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy and served as a Navy pilot in the Vietnam War. He was shot down over Hanoi in 1967\u00a0and was\u00a0a prisoner of war for five and a half years. McCain was tortured by the North Vietnamese, leaving him permanently disabled. He famously refused to be released ahead of POWs\u00a0who had been captured first \u2014 denying the enemy\u00a0a propaganda coup, since his father was then the commander of all U.S. forces in Vietnam. Upon his release in 1973, McCain studied at the Naval War College in Washington, DC, where he puzzled over the question of America\u2019s struggles in Vietnam, ultimately concluding that lack of political commitment to victory had led to defeat. It was a lesson that would guide his later approach, in Congress, to America\u2019s foreign interventions. McCain was assigned to be\u00a0the Navy\u2019s liaison to the Senate in 1977, which served as his introduction to politics. He retired in 1981 and ran for Congress in Arizona\u2019s first congressional district in 1982, and won. He opposed U.S. intervention in Lebanon, defying\u00a0President Ronald Reagan, warning that there was no\u00a0clear strategy for victory. He was proved correct, tragically, when a terrorist\u00a0drove a truck bomb into the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut later that year, killing hundreds of American and French peacekeeping troops and leading to an American withdrawal. In 1986, McCain won his first term in the U.S. Senate. He soon found himself embroiled in scandal as one of the Keating Five, accused of intervening in a federal investigation of the Lincoln Savings and Loan, run by McCain donor Charles H. Keating, Jr. McCain\u00a0was cleared of any wrongdoing beyond poor judgment, but the experience had\u00a0scarred him deeply, and he committed the rest of his Senate career to fighting against corruption and waste. McCain soon developed a reputation as a \u201cmaverick,\u201d defying his party whenever he thought it was veering too far to the right (or, critics said, whenever it suited his own\u00a0ambitions). In 2000, McCain ran for President, mounting a strong primary campaign against Texas governor George W. Bush and winning New Hampshire, where his brand of centrist politics found traction. He lost\u00a0a bitter South Carolina primary race, however, and soon ran out of steam. In the Senate, McCain continued to build a profile as a reformer.\u00a0His major achievement was the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform law, officially known as the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA), which passed in 2002. Many Republicans were deeply critical of BCRA, which they saw as a form of unilateral disarmament and a limit on free speech. Parts of the law were ruled\u00a0unconstitutional in the controversial\u00a0Citizens United case in 2010. McCain also joined\u00a0the \u201cGang of 14,\u201d a bipartisan group of Senators that fought to preserve the filibuster after the Republicans threatened to end it\u00a0in response to\u00a0Democrats repeatedly blocking\u00a0President Bush\u2019s judicial nominees. And McCain continued to work with Democrats, notably Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-MA), in proposing\u00a0immigration reform bills that were backed by the administration but ultimately\u00a0collapsed due to opposition\u00a0within both parties. In 2003, McCain joined a bipartisan majority in the Senate in supporting the Iraq War. But unlike many others, who abandoned the war as a terrorist insurgency grew, McCain remained committed to victory. Drawing from his ideas on Vietnam, he argued that the U.S. needed additional troops to secure Iraqi cities, defeat local Al-Qaeda cells, and prevent new terrorists from infiltrating. As the war grew more unpopular, he was virtually alone in his position. However, President George W. Bush agreed with him, and launched the \u201csurge\u201d in 2007, in defiance of the opinions of the top military brass and the Iraq Study Group, a bipartisan panel that recommended reducing U.S. commitment to the war. McCain put aside his old rivalry with Bush and became the best surrogate for the White House\u2019s policy. In 2007, McCain launched a second presidential campaign. He was seen as a long-shot candidate, especially after his campaign lost several key staff members in mid-2007. But his steadfast commitment to the surge helped him to stand out among the other candidates on the debate stage, and voters were\u00a0moved\u00a0by the force of his convictions. In addition, it was clear that the electorate was ready for change, and McCain made the case that he alone among Republicans had a record of fighting for reforms. He won New Hampshire again, and eventually the nomination. In the general election, McCain faced\u00a0then-Sen. Barack Obama (D-IL), who had\u00a0just won a spectacular, if brutal, victory over then-Sen. Hillary Clinton (D-NY) in the Democratic primary. McCain made the controversial\u00a0decision not to attack Obama for his deep ties to the racist Chicago preacher Jeremiah Wright \u2014 perhaps out of a sense of guilt for his own early opposition to naming a pubic holiday for Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., which he regretted. McCain trailed Obama for most of the summer of 2008. But\u00a0he bested Obama at a religious forum hosted by pastor Rick Warren, and then upended the entire race by naming Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his running mate, the first time a woman had been named to a Republican presidential ticket. Palin, a corruption-busting fellow \u201cmaverick,\u201d captured the public imagination and briefly attracted the interest of women voters disappointed by Clinton\u2019s loss. But the McCain-Palin lead was short-lived. The media targeted Palin with hostile, even condescending, coverage. And then, in mid-September, the global financial crisis struck as Wall Street giant Lehman Brothers collapsed. Obama, who had criticized the Bush administration\u2019s economic performance for months, seemed prescient. McCain decided to show leadership by suspending his campaign and returning to Washington, DC, where he\u00a0backed a $700 billion bailout\u00a0in the form of the Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP), which was decried by conservatives and liberals alike. Obama, too, voted for TARP, but by the time they arrived at the first presidential debate a few days later, there was no longer any real difference between the candidates. Obama\u00a0went on to win the election easily. Conventional wisdom in party establishment circles partly blamed Palin for McCain\u2019s loss, but she helped turn out the conservative vote in areas where the moderate McCain had struggled to connect. Recently, McCain said that he regretted choosing Palin instead of Democrat-turned-independent Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, a fellow foreign policy hawk and the man who nearly became vice president on the Democratic ticket with Al Gore in 2000. Back in the Senate, McCain remained deeply critical of Obama\u2019s foreign policies, as the new administration backed away from the country\u2019s previous commitments to Iraq, creating a vacuum for the Iranian regime and new terrorist groups like the so-called Islamic State. But McCain remained a maverick, and joined the bipartisan \u201cGang of Eight\u201d in proposing a new immigration reform bill \u2014 despite having run for re-election in 2010 on a promise to \u201cbuild the danged fence\u201d along the U.S.-Mexico border. The bill ultimately died due to conservative opposition in the House. In 2015, McCain was deeply critical of\u00a0Donald Trump, who had entered the race for president on a platform of strong opposition to illegal immigration. In response, Trump aimed a pointed insult at McCain\u2019s war record: \u201cI like people who weren\u2019t captured.\u201d That ignited a feud that never ended. McCain\u2019s decisive, dramatic \u201cthumbs-down\u201d vote to defeat an effort to repeal Obamacare in July 2017 was widely perceived\u00a0as motivated by personal revenge. McCain announced that he had brain cancer last July, but continued to work in the Senate as he received treatment. His condition worsened in recent months, and he returned to Arizona to convalesce at home, surrounded by friends and family. His family announced on Aug. 24 that he was ending medical treatment. He is survived by his wife, Cindy McCain (n\u00e9e Hensley), his first wife,\u00a0Carol Shepp McCain; seven children, many grandchildren, and his redoubtable mother, Roberta, still alive at the ripe old age of 106. Associates of the ailing Senator made it clear in the closing days of his life that he did not want President Trump to attend his funeral. John McCain will be remembered for many things \u2014 his heroic endurance in Vietnam, his passion for reform, his battles with his own party, and his\u00a0support for the military. But perhaps the most memorable\u00a0tribute came from the conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer, who wrote after McCain\u2019s tough loss in the 2008 election: \u201cHe will be \u2014 he should be \u2014 remembered as the most worthy presidential nominee ever to be denied the prize.",

Maria Cantwell (D-WA) issued a press release stating she will be the latest Democrat to join the effort to block Gorsuch from receiving a vote on the Senate Floor. By Breitbart\u2019s count, the majority of the Senate Democratic Caucus have now pledged their support for a filibuster, called for initially by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY). At most, twelve remain undecided. An NBC News/SurveyMonkey poll released Thursday put the American public at 54% for giving Gorsuch an up-or-down vote, while 37% are opposed. A growing number of Republican senators, in light the increasing indication Democrats will reach the fourty-one votes needed for a successful filibuster, have expressed their willingness to invoke the \u201cConstitutional Option\u201d and extend the Democrats\u2019 elimination of filibusters to Supreme Court nominees once and for all. McCain, one of the longest-serving Republicans in the Senate, is attempting to reach some kind of deal to put Gorsuch on the Supreme Court and yet save the traditional sixty-vote cloture rule. For any such deal, he would need six additional Democrats to join the upper chamber\u2019s fifty-two Republicans and two Democrats, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND), who each issued statements Thursday indicating they would support Gorsuch\u2019s confirmation. \u201cThere\u2019s always hope, because maybe we\u2019ll recognize the damage that\u2019s been done to the institution and the American people,\u201d McCain told Bloomberg Politics. \u201cI\u2019ll have conversations, but I\u2019m not optimistic.\u201d Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) engaged in negotiations across the aisle of his own. \u201cWhile he has been urging Democratic colleagues not to filibuster, he has been clear that he will do whatever is necessary to confirm Judge Gorsuch to the Supreme Court,\u201d his spokesman Jason Samuels told Breitbart. Neither Flake nor McCain expressed a great deal of hope the looming showdown between the two rapidly entrenching blocs over the future of Senate rules could be averted before the vote on Gorsuch\u2019s nomination, now set for April 7.",

            "author": "Aaron Klein",
            "content": " Yet McCain maintains he had an \u201cobligation\u201d to pass the wild charges against Donald Trump to FBI Director James Comey and he would even do it again. \u201cAnyone who doesn\u2019t like it can go to hell,\u201d McCain exclaimed. In the book\u00a0The Restless Wave, McCain provides an inside account of how he says he came across the dossier. He writes that he was told about the claims in the document at a security conference in Canada in November 2016, where he was approached by Sir Andrew Wood, a former British ambassador to Moscow and friend of ex-British spy Christopher Steele, the author of the dossier. McCain wrote that Wood told him Steele \u201chad been commissioned to investigate connections between the Trump campaign and Russian agents as well as potentially compromising information about the President-elect that Putin allegedly possessed.\u201d McCain, however, did not address the obvious question of whether he was told exactly who \u201ccommissioned\u201d Steele to \u201cinvestigate\u201d the alleged Russian ties. The dossier was commissioned by the controversial Fusion GPS opposition research firm, which was paid for its anti-Trump work by Trump\u2019s primary political opponents, namely Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) via the Perkins Coie law firm. McCain goes on to describe Wood as telling him Steele\u2019s work \u201cwas mostly raw, unverified intelligence, but that the author strongly believed merited a thorough examination by counterintelligence experts.\u201d The politician says the dossier claims described to him were \u201ctoo strange a scenario to believe, something out of a le Carr\u00e9 novel, not the kind of thing anyone has ever actually had to worry about with a new President, no matter what other concerns.\u201d Still, McCain says he reasoned that \u201ceven a remote risk that the President of the United States might be vulnerable to Russian extortion had to be investigated.\u201d McCain concedes Wood told him he had not actually read the dossier himself, and writes that he wasn\u2019t sure if he ever met Wood before and couldn\u2019t recall previously having a conversation with Wood. Still, McCain took Wood\u2019s word for it when Wood vouched for Steele\u2019s credibility. \u201cSteele was a respected professional, Wood assured us, who had good Russian contacts and long experience collecting and analyzing intelligence on the Kremlin,\u201d McCain wrote. Present at the meeting with Wood and McCain was David J. Kramer, a former State Department official and longtime McCain associate who agreed to \u201cgo to London to meet Steele, confirm his credibility and report back to me.\u201d McCain doesn\u2019t detail Kramer\u2019s visit to London beyond simply writing, \u201cWhen David returned, and shared his impression that the former spy was, as Sir Andrew had vouched, a respected professional, and not to outward appearances given to hyperbole or hysteria, I agreed to receive a copy of what is now referred to as \u2018the dossier.\u2019\u2019\u2019 McCain leaves out exactly where Kramer obtained his dossier copy. The\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0reported\u00a0in February that Kramer received the dossier directly from Fusion GPS after McCain expressed interest in it. Those details marked the clearest indication that McCain may have known that the dossier originated with Fusion GPS, meaning that he may have knowingly passed on political material to the FBI. Also, in a\u00a0New York Times\u00a0oped\u00a0in January, GPS co-founders Glenn Simpson and Peter Fritch wrote that they helped McCain share their anti-Trump dossier with the Obama-era intelligence community via an unnamed \u201cemissary.\u201d Without mentioning Fusion GPS, McCain goes on to briefly describe turning over the dossier to Comey: The allegations were disturbing, but I had no idea which if any were true. I could not independently verify any of it, and so I did what any American who cares about our nation\u2019s security should have done. I put the dossier in my office safe, called the office of the Director of the FBI Jim Comey and asked for a meeting. I went to see him at his earliest convenience, handed him the dossier, explained how it had come into my possession. I said I didn\u2019t know what to make of it, and I trusted the FBI would examine it carefully and investigate its claims. With that, I thanked the director and left. The entire meeting had probably not lasted longer than ten minutes. I did what duty demanded I do. I don\u2019t know what is true, partially true or not true in the dossier. I gave it to the people best equipped to answer those questions. Had I done any more, I would have exceeded my capability. Had I done any less I would be ashamed of myself. And if any of my colleagues in Congress had been in my situation and not done what I did, I would be ashamed of them. McCain implies he was essentially targeted as an appropriate venue to deliver the dossier to the FBI due to his hawkish views on Putin and Russia: Why had I been given the dossier? That\u2019s the first accusatory question in every budding conspiracy theory about my minor role in the controversy. The answer is too obvious for the paranoid to credit. I am known internationally to be a persistent critic of Vladimir Putin\u2019s regime, and I have been for a long while. Wood and Steele likely assumed that my animosity toward Putin, which I unapologetically acknowledge, ensured that I would take their concerns seriously. They assumed correctly. A few weeks after McCain gave Steele\u2019s dossier to Comey on Dec. 9, 2016, the FBI chief updated then President-Elect Trump and President Obama on the dossier in a classified briefing. As Breitbart News\u00a0documented, Comey\u2019s dossier briefing to Trump was subsequently leaked to the news media, setting in motion a flurry of news media attention on the dossier, including the release of the document to the public. The briefing also may have provided the veneer of respectability to a document that had been circulating for months within the news media but widely considered too unverified to publicize. ",

            "author": "Joel B. Pollak",
            "content": " The\u00a0Times\u2018 editorial, \u201cAmerica\u2019s Lethal Politics,\u201d\u00a0will appear in the print edition of Thursday\u2019s newspaper. It argues that political violence will continue unless President Donald Trump and the Republicans stop opposing gun control. Along the way, the\u00a0Times claims [original link]: Was this attack evidence of how vicious American politics has become? Probably. In 2011, when Jared Lee Loughner opened fire in a supermarket parking lot, grievously wounding Representative Gabby Giffords and killing six people, including a 9-year-old girl, the link to political incitement was clear. Before the shooting, Sarah Palin\u2019s political action committee circulated\u00a0a map of targeted electoral districts that put Ms. Giffords and 19 other Democrats under stylized cross hairs. However, there was no evidence of\u00a0political \u201cincitement.\u201d First of all, the Tucson killer, Jared Loughner, was mentally disturbed and had no political motivations. As even the left-wing HuffPost reiterated\u00a0Wednesday: \u201cPeople said Jared Lee Loughner was motivated by politics. Reporting proved them wrong.\u201d Second, Sarah Palin\u2019s map was virtually identical to those used by Democrats for years, depicting targets atop contested congressional districts. At the time, Palin called the false accusations against her a \u201cblood libel,\u201d and for good reason: it was a slander imputing responsibility to her for the deaths of innocents, with the sole purpose of punishing her for her beliefs. The\u00a0Times goes on to argue that \u201cthere\u2019s no sign of incitement as direct as in the Giffords attack\u201d in Wednesday\u2019s shooting. That statement is so completely false that it calls to mind George Orwell\u2019s\u00a0observation about journalism during the Spanish Civil War: \u201cI saw newspaper reports which did not bear any relation to the facts, not even the relationship which is implied in an ordinary lie.\u201d There is no evidence whatsoever\u00a0of political incitement in the Giffords case, while there is overwhelming evidence that James T. Hodgkinson, the now-deceased attacker\u00a0at the baseball diamond, nurtured a vicious hatred of Trump and Republicans\u00a0and was a fan of left-wing media. And according to eyewitnesses, he asked whether the players were Republicans or Democrats before attacking. That is not conclusive evidence of incitement \u2014 at least, not yet \u2014 but it is more persuasive than in any other recent case. The\u00a0Times\u2018 false equivalence between the\u00a0two shootings provides a sick excuse\u00a0for what Hodgkinson did by\u00a0making it appear to be partially Republicans\u2019 fault.

            "content": " A week after Palin called for Obama to be impeached over his lawlessness on immigration on the pages of Breitbart News, two-thirds of Republicans believed that impeachment is justified while a majority of independents felt that Obama has overstepped his Constitutional authority.\u00a0Speaking at the Western Conservative Summit in Colorado, Palin said \u201cconsidering articles of impeachment is the check\u201d against a lawless executive branch. Citing Obama\u2019s \u201cdereliction of duty\u201d in enforcing the country\u2019s immigration laws and securing the border, Palin said, \u201cif that\u2019s not impeachable, then nothing is. And if he\u2019s not impeachable, no one is.\u201d \u201cIt takes guts to hold them accountable,\u201d she said. \u201cIt takes political will.\u201d Palin told Republicans to \u201cdon\u2019t be afraid to raise\u201d the impeachment issue because Obama is making \u201chimself a ruler and not a president.\u201d Palin said America had a revolution because \u201cwe don\u2019t do kings.\u201d She observed that \u201cthese days you hear a lot of politicians denouncing Barack Obama,\u201d saying he\u2019s a lawless and imperial president who ignores court orders, changes laws by executive fiat, and refuses to enforce laws that he just doesn\u2019t like. Palin asked the politicians who are complaining, \u201cwhat are ya gonna do about it? \u201cLet\u2019s call their bluff,\u201d Palin said. \u201cI\u2019m calling their bluff because we need a little less talk and a lot more action.\u201d Declaring that Obama\u2019s lawlessness is \u201crocking us to our core,\u201d Palin said that \u201cno\u00a0serious person can deny that team Obama has not violated and abused the public trust and the Constitution.\u201d Palin listed Benghazi, Fast and Furious, NSA spying scandals, Obamacare lies, the IRS\u2019s targeting of conservatives, the administration\u2019s violation of religious rights, and the Department of Justice\u2019s wiretapping of reporters. \u201cThe\u00a0list of abuses goes on and on,\u201d she said. Palin also mentioned that \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d does not refer to today\u2019s ordinary criminal charges. She reiterated that the Framers referred to \u201ca dereliction of duty,\u201d and \u201cthe first duty of the president is to enforce\u00a0our laws and preserve and protect and defend our Constitution.\u201d She said\u00a0Alexander Hamilton said impeachable offenses refer to \u201cthe abuse or violation of some public trust.\u201d Hamilton called them \u201cpolitical offenses\u201d because they relate \u201cchiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself,\u201d Palin said, noting that impeachment is a check against a lawless executive. Palin announced in an op-ed on\u00a0Breitbart.com\u00a0that Obama\u2019s \u201cmany impeachable offenses\u201d can no longer be ignored. \u201cIt\u2019s time to impeach; and on behalf of American workers and legal immigrants of all backgrounds, we should vehemently oppose any politician on the left or right who would hesitate in voting for articles of impeachment,\u201d\u00a0Palin wrote. As Breitbart News noted, \u201cPalin specifically said Obama\u2019s lawlessness on illegal immigration was the tipping point because it impacted Americans \u2014 native-born and legal immigrants \u2014 of all backgrounds\u201d: The federal government is trillions of dollars in debt; many cities are on the verge of insolvency; our overrun healthcare system, police forces, social services, schools, and our unsustainably generous welfare-state programs are stretched to the max. We average Americans know that. So why has this issue been allowed to be turned upside down with our \u201cleader\u201d creating such unsafe conditions while at the same time obstructing any economic recovery by creating more dependents than he allows producers? His friendly wealthy bipartisan elite, who want cheap foreign labor and can afford for themselves the best \u201cborder security\u201d money can buy in their own exclusive communities, do not care that Obama tapped us out. Have faith that average American workers \u2013 native-born and wonderful legal immigrants of all races, backgrounds, and political parties \u2013 do care because we\u2019re the ones getting screwed as we\u2019re forced to follow all our government\u2019s rules while others are not required to do so. Many now feel like strangers in their own land. It\u2019s the American worker who is forced to deal with Obama\u2019s latest crisis with our hard-earned tax dollars while middle class wages decrease, sustainable jobs get more scarce, and communities become unrecognizable and bankrupted due to Obama\u2019s flood of illegal immigration. Who\u2019s looking out for the American workers? Who has their backs? Who fights for them? We should. Obama has also been reportedly concerned that his executive actions on immigration can lead to impeachment. He reportedly, in a half-joking manner, told pro-amnesty activists at the White House, \u201cYou\u2019re not going to get me impeached, are you?\u201d",

We desperately need new conservative leaders in the U.S. Senate who will serve with passion, intelligence, and integrity.\u201d UPDATE: McDaniel told Breitbart News that Palin\u2019s endorsement will help him and his campaign \u201cend the rule of the permanent political class in Washington, D.C.\u201d: \u201cGovernor Sarah Palin\u2019s endorsement is very important in the state of Mississippi. We Mississippians are conservatives, and we share Sarah Palin\u2019s passion for limited government, lower taxes, traditional values, and constitutional liberties. This is a grassroots movement driven by the people of Mississippi, so there\u2019s no question Gov. Palin\u2019s endorsement will help motivate people to get behind this campaign to end the rule of the permanent political class in Washington, D.C.\u201d Palin wrote that McDaniel was \u201cjust such a leader\u201d who is\u00a0\u201cin this race not for career, but for conservative change.\u201d\u00a0She said he \u201chas a proven record of fighting for conservative principles in the Mississippi State Senate\u201d and \u201cbeen a champion of limited government, free enterprise, civic participation, reduced tax rates, a strong national defense, and a return to the original checks and balances of the Constitution.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s a proven fighter for the rights of We the People. For example, he\u2019s taken on special interests in defense of our private property rights against the abuse of eminent domain, and he\u2019s introduced legislation to protect our 2nd Amendment rights against federal government overreach,\u201d Palin wrote. McDaniel said that he was \u201ctruly humbled that Governor Palin has honored my request for her to join my campaign in this fight for liberty in Mississippi.\u201d \u201cGovernor Palin is a true champion of conservative self-reliance that so many Americans and Mississippians identify with and admire,\u201d he said. \u201cWe knew we\u2019d need help in this uphill battle against entrenched incumbency in Washington, D.C. and we could not be more thrilled to have the governor\u2019s support.\u201d Cochran has said he was\u00a0unfamiliar\u00a0with the Tea Party movement, and he may now realize what that movement is about as Palin, considered the North Star for the conservative grassroots, can galvanize and boost candidates like no other, especially in what is expected to be a low-turnout primary on June 3. \u201cThe Tea Party is something I don\u2019t really know a lot about,\u201d Cochran recently told Mississippi television stations. \u201cIt\u2019s a free country. We have open opportunities for people to participate in the election process.\u201d Former South Carolina Senator and Heritage Foundation President Jim DeMint has said that Palin\u2019s endorsement has the\u00a0most impact\u00a0in GOP primaries. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) has said that\u00a0he would not be in the Senate were it not for Palin\u2019s endorsement, for instance. Palin urged conservatives to learn more about McDaniel on his website,\u00a0www.mcdaniel2014.com, and her endorsement is likely to rally conservatives against Cochran, who has been assailed as an appropriator who has not stood up Washington\u2019s fiscal irresponsibility. As Breitbart News has reported, Cochran \u201chas voted on at least 11 occasions to raise the debt ceiling by at least $7.7 trillion over the past 24 years.\u201d Cochran, who has been described by mainstream outlets as a \u201cseasoned appropriator\u201d who is a \u201cspitting image of the Republican establishment,\u201d\u00a0reportedly planned on retiring after his term but was convinced to run for another because he would gain control of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee should the GOP pick up six seats in the fall to take back control of the Senate. Even before an establishment PAC\u00a0associated\u00a0with former Mississippi Governor and lobbyist Haley Barbour had formed to try to save Cochran\u2019s candidacy by running attack ads against McDaniel statewide,\u00a0Palin\u00a0had indicated that she would be looking closely at the Mississippi GOP Senate primary. McDaniel has also been\u00a0endorsed by Heritage Action, the Senate Conservative Fund, the Club for Growth, and Freedomworks. Palin, after promising to start rolling out endorsements for candidates this week who would go to Washington to fight for conservative values, has\u00a0endorsed T.W. Shannon for Senate in Oklahoma and Ben Sasse\u00a0for Senate in Nebraska in addition to McDaniel.",

China\u2019s predatory pricing of steel and aluminum exports is designed to destroy the financial viability of America\u2019s domestic manufacturers of the metals, said Mansour: What China is doing, they are willing to take a loss on steel and dump steel below the price of what it costs them to make it simply because they want to destroy our industry for a strategic reason. They want the world to be dependent on them. They want to take the market; that\u2019s why they\u2019re dumping steel. This is an act of war. This is economic warfare. \u201cPOTUS isn\u2019t starting any trade war\u2026 it\u2019s been raging for decades and we keep losing,\u201d wrote Palin. \u201cPeople MUST understand our nation\u2019s solvency and sovereignty are at stake here.\u201d  The \u201cTrump Doctrine\u201d illustrates the president\u2019s wisdom via his \u201cprivate sector experience,\u201d wrote Palin: President Trump inherited this trade war, and he\u2019s an atypical politician determined to actually do something to fix the problem. The Trump Doctrine involves finally enforcing rules and standards to level the playing field \u2014 which proves the wisdom of private sector perspective brought to the White House.

We never ever, ever intended it to be gun sights,\u201d SarahPac spokeswoman Rebecca Mansour, now senior West Coast editor at Breitbart News, told ABC News at the time.

I saw it first-hand. I was there on the campaign trail. I saw how things were changing. I saw more and more people\u2019s eyes open, and I think so much of that was based on the church in general, those people of faith who were praying to God that people would wake up.\u201d LISTEN:  \u201cRemember, our Founders dedicated this land, this new country that would be America, this idea of America, dedicated it to God,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cIf I were President, I\u2019d re-dedicate us to God. When I was governor I proclaimed that, the state of Alaska, this is yours, Lord. May your will be done here. We need to do that again in America.\u201d \u201cPrayer warriors across the country, people who perhaps had never expressed their faith in a higher being before, knew that Jeez, we got to\u00a0be on our knees asking for a change here, because we\u2019re going down the wrong road. I was so grateful to see so many people step up in that realm,\u201d Palin said. She added a personal note, something she said she\u2019s never talked about in public before: \u201cI was very grateful to see that the church stepped up, because eight years ago, I felt that they didn\u2019t. Besides the attacks on my family and supporters, the most hurtful thing about the election, the vilification, the marginalization, the ridicule that hit us \u2013 my family and me, eight years ago \u2013 was that I didn\u2019t feel that the church did circle the wagons and step up boldly and say, \u2018What? No, that\u2019s not what she\u2019s saying,\u2019 or \u2018That\u2019s not what she represents.\u2019 Because some of them knew me.\u201d \u201cA lot of these famous pastors, and people all over the country, right after the election were sending me their secret confidential little love notes about, \u2018Oh, you know, my heart was with ya, and you know if there\u2019s ever anything I can do for you, just let me know, because I believe in you, and I believed in you during the election, I\u2019m so sorry what you went through.\u2019 And would sit there reading this stuff, saying, \u2018Well, where were you? Why didn\u2019t you step up? You\u2019re going to\u00a0have to step up next time, or that next person is going to\u00a0go down too,\u201d she remembered sadly. \u201cSo yes, thank God. Literally, I\u2019m thanking God that this go-around, enough pastors, enough congregations, enough people who don\u2019t even ever get in the four walls of a church, but know there is greater purpose in our lives and there is a greater being who has everything in His hands \u2014 more of the Church stepped up, prayed about this very hard (and they need to keep praying about it). They did their job,\u201d Palin concluded. She thought it was fair to ask if there should be career consequences for pundits and analysts who got everything wrong in the long prelude to the 2016 election, especially given their enthusiasm to \u201ccrucify those who get it right.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s just accept that it\u2019s going to go on, and allow then our strength to be made manifest when we realize, okay, they\u2019re going to\u00a0keep getting it wrong, and they\u2019re going to keep trying to crucify us,\u201d she recommended. \u201cSo what? Life\u2019s not fair. There are more of us than there are of them. There really are.\u201d \u201cThey are very vocal, those who want to transform America and take away your freedom of speech. They\u2019re not the majority. The majority of Americans are right on target in where we want to go with liberty and all of our freedoms. So let\u2019s hang on to that, knowing that good, that\u2019s a tool for empowerment right there, is knowing what the numbers are,\u201d she urged.",

Law enforcement called 39 times in the last number of years at his family\u2019s home. There were so many red flags. I\u2019m embarrassed for the FBI. The rank and file guys and gals, they work so hard. It\u2019s the top brass. It\u2019s a matter of priorities in the FBI, and that\u2019s where I think the discussion needs to go.\u201d Since 2010, local law enforcement\u00a0had been called to the family home of shooter Nikolas Cruz, according to CNN: Broward sheriff\u2019s deputies were called to the Cruz family home 39 times since 2010, according to documents obtained by CNN. The sheriff\u2019s office received a range of emergency calls that included reports of a mentally ill person, child/elderly abuse, a domestic disturbance and a missing person. Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel said Friday there were 20 calls for service over the past \u201cfew years\u201d pertaining to Nikolas Cruz. Cruz regularly expressed his interest in violence and mass murder, both online and in person. One acquaintance who knew Cruz from elementary school spoke with Miami\u2019s CBS affiliate: \u201cHe recalled Cruz stealing peoples\u2019 [sic] mail, throwing rocks at cars and tormenting animals. He described one incident in which he said Cruz \u201ccornered a squirrel and was trying to throw rocks at it and kill it.\u201d Cruz also regularly introduced himself to people as \u201ca school shooter.\u201d His online comments include,\u00a0\u201cI wanna shoot people with my AR-15\u201d and \u201cIm going to be a professional school shooter.\u201d Florida Gov. Rick Scott called on FBI Director Christopher Wray to resign for \u201cfailure to take action\u201d to prevent Cruz\u2019s mass murder, issuing\u00a0a\u00a0statement: The FBI\u2019s failure to take action against this killer is unacceptable. The FBI has admitted that they were contacted last month by a person who called to inform them of Cruz\u2019s \u201cdesire to kill people,\u201d and \u201cthe potential of him conducting a school shooting.\u201d Seventeen innocent people are dead and acknowledging a mistake isn\u2019t going to cut it. An apology will never bring these 17 Floridians back to life or comfort the families who are in pain. The families will spend a lifetime wondering how this could happen, and an apology will never give them the answers they desperately need. We constantly promote \u201csee something, say something,\u201d and a courageous person did just that to the FBI. And the FBI failed to act. \u201cSee something, say something\u201d is an incredibly important tool and people must have confidence in the follow through from law enforcement. The FBI director needs to resign. \u201cThis is such a failure. There are\u00a017 people dead, and it could have been prevented,\u201d said Mansour.",

            "subtitle": "The late Andrew Breitbart helped\u00a0Sarah Palin defend herself when Fox News Channel\u2019s former\u00a0Chairman Roger Ailes denied\u00a0her the opportunity to\u00a0respond\u00a0on air\u00a0to the\u00a0media\u2019s false accusations framing her for inciting the attempted assassination\u00a0of former Congresswoman Gabrielle \u201cGabby\u201d Giffords (D-AZ) in the days immediately following the 2011 Tucson mass shooting incident.",
            "author": "Robert Kraychik",
            "content": " \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for Breitbart, so much of our commonsense defense wouldn\u2019t have gotten out there, because I was working for Fox News at the time, and I was not allowed to go on the air to defend myself for days,\u201d Palin said, speaking publicly about this for the first time, during a Friday interview on SiriusXM\u2019s Breitbart News Tonight with Breitbart\u2019s Senior Editor-at-Large Rebecca Mansour. The media firestorm surrounding the 2011 Giffords shooting actually began during the 2010 midterm elections, when Democrats accused Palin of inciting violence\u00a0because her political action committee (PAC), SarahPAC, circulated a map with crosshairs over congressional districts that the\u00a0Republican Party\u00a0hoped to win\u00a0that year. Palin\u2019s graphic highlighted 20 specific swing districts\u00a0that she\u00a0and Sen. John McCain (R-AZ)\u00a0carried in the 2008 presidential race but were represented by a Democrat in Congress. With Palin\u2019s help, Republican candidates successfully won 19 of those 20 districts in the 2010 midterms. The one seat that did not swing to Republicans was held by\u00a0Gabby Giffords, who was shot on January 8, 2011, a few months after winning her re-election bid, when a mentally ill gunman, Jared Loughner, opened fire at a Tucson, Arizona, constituent gathering, wounding Giffords and killing six others. Democrats and their establishment\u00a0media allies cast blame on Palin for the mass shooting. However, as Breitbart Senior Editor-at-Large Joel Pollak reported, the public eventually learned that Giffords\u2019 shooter \u201cwas mentally disturbed and had no political motivations,\u201d and Palin\u2019s map graphic \u201cwas virtually identical to those used by Democrats for years, depicting targets atop contested congressional districts.\u201d \u201cThere is\u00a0no evidence whatsoever\u00a0of political incitement in the Giffords case,\u201d concluded Pollak. Fox News\u2019s\u00a0management denied Palin\u2019s requests to defend herself on the cable\u00a0network\u00a0against the aforementioned slander. And Palin, a Fox News contributor at the time, was also prevented by her strictly enforced employment contract from doing any rival media appearances without prior authorization from Fox management. \u201cI think that that time was our toughest time in this last decade of being out there on a public platform, [with] false accusations that we were to blame for the Gabby Giffords shooting,\u201d said Palin. \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for Breitbart, so much of our commonsense defense wouldn\u2019t have gotten out there, because I was working for Fox News at the time, and I was not allowed to go on the air to defend myself for days, and finally I bucked management of Fox News\u2014I never even talked about this publicly\u2014I bucked management and said, \u2018I\u2019ll do my own video, and I\u2019ll post it, and I\u2019ll explain to people that, no, we are not to blame.\u2019 My relationship with Fox was never the same after that.\u201d Palin noted Ailes\u2019 repeated refusal to allow\u00a0her a platform to defend herself from a barrage of media attacks falsely accusing her of inciting mass murder. \u201cI had asked [Roger Ailes], \u2018How many days do we have to go listening to this with no defense articulated at all? May I please go on the air?\u2019 And he wouldn\u2019t let me,\u201d said Palin. \u201cSo that was a tough time.\u201d Mansour, who worked as a senior aide and speechwriter for Palin at the time, reflected on how Democrats and their news media allies sought to lay blame for the mass murder and attempted assassination of Giffords at the feet of Palin and her staff. \u201cThat whole Gabby Giffords thing,\u201d said Mansour. \u201cIt was one of the worst moments, and we felt like we were besieged by people accusing us falsely, and your heart was just broken, too, because you\u2019re a mom, and you\u2019re watching the people suffering. I know this hits you really hard at home, because you have a big heart. What was interesting, when you look back, is that you have had instances like this again and again with the media, with a vicious media that just targets you and your family and just goes after you for these things.\u201d \u201cAnd I look at President Trump, right now, and the stuff that he faces\u2014and believe me, it\u2019s just awful, the fake news crap\u2014but\u00a0here is my take,\u201d Mansour continued. \u201c[Trump] always had connections with other media figures, he had a lot of money, and an organization defending him. But when you came on the scene, you were just an ordinary American, your family was very middle-class, just ordinary folks, you had risen up from the grassroots as a corruption-buster who was elected governor of Alaska, and you did not have a giant megaphone of people in the establishment media back east [defending you]. So when these people just came at you, it was really very scary, it was like being surrounded. Till this day, I still hear people repeat lies about you, and I\u2019m like, \u2018You have no idea that that\u2019s completely bogus.\u2019 How do feel about this now and what were the lessons learned?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t live by the praise of man so I know I\u2019m not going to die by their criticisms,\u201d said Palin. \u201cSo whatever they say, I don\u2019t care what the critics say.\u201d Palin described the period as trying for her and her family, noting that the intensity and hostility of biased media attacks\u00a0take a toll on even the strongest family. \u201c[I wish] people understood what it does to a family, how it potentially could rip apart a family because everybody has a different idea of how to react to the circumstances around you, and that causes some stress,\u201d said Palin. \u201cI thank God every day that I have a strong family, and we\u2019re doing great. Hopefully our story could inspire people to know that whatever they\u2019re facing, the sun will come out tomorrow and things can get better. It\u2019s just a matter of how you react to sometimes horrible circumstances around you.\u201d \u201cStill to this day, the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0has still alluded to\u00a0[the Giffords shoot] and placed blame,\u201d Palin noted, alluding to a\u00a0New York Times\u00a0op-ed in June of 2017 that again blamed Palin for the 2011 mass shooting in Arizona.\u00a0Palin then\u00a0filed a defamation lawsuit against the Times for\u00a0falsely accusing her of inciting Loughner to shoot Giffords. Mansour recounted how she met Andrew Breitbart and a person the Breitbart News founder described as \u201cone of his really smart friends\u201d for the first time in 2011 when they offered to help Palin and her team. \u201cThat was the first time I met Andrew Breitbart,\u201d said Mansour. \u201cIt was during that time. It was a very troubled time. Our PAC was being falsely implicated in something that had absolutely nothing to do with us \u2026 and it was Andrew Breitbart who offered to help us. He basically came to me and said, \u2018Hey, how can I help? And I want to introduce you to one of my really smart friends who\u2019s going to help you, too, and by the way, his name is Joel Pollak.\u2019 And that was how I first met Joel Pollak.\u201d",

            "subtitle": "On Tuesday evening, former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin hired Hulk Hogan\u2019s lawyers and sued the New York Times for defamation for falsely accusing her in a June 14 editorial of inciting Jared Lee Loughner to shoot Rep. Gabby Giffords (D-AZ). The Times\u2019 editorial was published on the day that James Hodgkinson shot House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA) while he was practicing for the Congressional Baseball Game with his GOP teammates.",
            "author": "Tony Lee",
            "content": " \u201cToday, Sarah Palin took a stand against The New York Times Company by filing a lawsuit which seeks to hold The Times accountable for stating that Governor Palin is part of a \u2018sickeningly familiar pattern\u2019 of politically motivated violence and that she incited the horrific 2011 shooting of Representative Gabby Giffords, a tragedy where the gunman seriously wounded numerous people and killed 6, including a federal judge and a 9-year-old girl,\u201d Palin\u2019s lawyers\u2014Ken Turkel, Shane Vogt, and S. Preston Ricardo\u2014said in a statement. The complaint, filed in Manhattan federal court in the Southern District of New York, states that \u201cat the time of publication, The Times knew and had published pieces acknowledging that there was no connection between Mrs. Palin and Loughner\u2019s 2011 shooting.\u201d \u201cIn doing so, The Times violated the law and its own policies,\u201d it reads. Messrs. Turkel, Vogt, and Ricardo said Palin \u201cseeks to hold The Times to its November 13, 2016, pledge [\u2018to rededicate itself to reporting facts honestly and holding power to account\u2019], and to face both journalistic and financial accountability for the false statements that it published about Mrs. Palin.\u201d As Breitbart News previously noted, Palin indicated on Twitter that she was \u201cconsidering suing the New York Times for libel\u201d the day after the Times published its editorial even though \u201cit has long been established that there has never been any evidence whatsoever linking Palin to the attempted assassination.\u201d   Here is what the Times originally wrote in its editorial: Was this attack evidence of how vicious American politics has become? Probably. In 2011, when Jared Lee Loughner opened fire in a supermarket parking lot, grievously wounding Representative Gabby Giffords and killing six people, including a 9-year-old girl, the link to political incitement was clear. Before the shooting, Sarah Palin\u2019s political action committee circulated a map of targeted electoral districts that put Ms. Giffords and 19 other Democrats under stylized cross hairs. The Times, after much public backlash from even Palin\u2019s harshest\u00a0critics on the left and right, then issued two subsequent corrections. After adding that \u201cno connection to the shooting was ever established\u201d to its original editorial, the Times issued this correction on June 15: An earlier version of this editorial incorrectly stated that a link existed between political incitement and the 2011 shooting of Representative Gabby Giffords. In fact, no such link was established. But the Times never corrected that it had falsely stated that Palin had put \u201cGiffords and 19 other Democrats under stylized cross hairs\u201d when Palin did no such thing. Later in the day on June 15, the Times edited its editorial again to note that Palin\u2019s map \u201cshowed the targeted electoral districts of Ms. Giffords and 19 other Democrats under stylized cross hairs.\u201d It then issued its second correction: The editorial also incorrectly described a map distributed by a political action committee before that shooting. It depicted electoral districts, not individual Democratic lawmakers, beneath stylized cross hairs. Yet, in a statement to CNN, the Times insisted that their errors did not \u201cundercut or weaken the argument of the piece.\u201d Palin\u2019s lawyers pointed out that \u201cdespite recognizing that its statements about Mrs. Palin in the June 14, 2017 column \u2018America\u2019s Lethal Politics\u2019 are not true, The Times repeatedly failed to meaningfully retract or correct its column and apologize to Mrs. Palin for publishing it. Rather, The Times issued a statement affirming that its \u2018error doesn\u2019t undercut or weaken the argument of the piece.\u2019\u201d To prove that the Times had \u201cample facts available that established that there was no connection between Mrs. Palin and Loughner\u2019s crime,\u201d the lawyers point to an article the Times published on January 15, 2011, that \u201crecognized that no direct or clear link between political rhetoric and Loughner\u2019s actions could be claimed.\u201d In addition, the lawyers point out that New York Times columnist Charles Blow once wrote that \u201cthe only problem is that there was no evidence then, and even now, that overheated rhetoric from the right had anything to do with the shooting\u201d of Giffords. The lawyers also refer to Blow\u2019s column, \u201cShe Who Must Not Be Named,\u201d\u00a0that was critical of the left\u2019s and the establishment press\u2019s continued coverage of Palin. In Blow\u2019s column, he asks, \u201cWhat purpose does it serve other than inflaming passions to drive viewership and Web clicks?\u201d The complaint points out that Blow\u2019s \u201ccolumn acknowledges that there is existing hostility held toward\u00a0Mrs. Palin, and also recognizes that her name and attacks upon her inflame passions and thereby drive viewership and Web clicks to media companies.\u201d \u201cThe Times published the Palin Article with actual knowledge that stories attacking Mrs. Palin inflame passions, which drives viewership and Web clicks,\u201d the complaint further reads. \u201cThus, The Times knowingly and voluntarily exploited and retained a benefit conferred by Mrs. Palin, in special circumstances particular to this case in which it would be inequitable for The Times to retain that benefit without paying the value thereof to Mrs. Palin.\u201d Palin\u2019s attorneys argue that the Times\u2019\u00a0\u201cconduct was committed knowingly, intentionally, willfully, wantonly and maliciously, with the intent to harm Mrs. Palin, or in blatant disregard of the substantial likelihood of causing her harm, thereby entitling Mrs. Palin to an award of punitive damages.\u201d Two of Palin\u2019s lawyers\u2013Messrs. Turkel and Vogt\u2013successfully represented Hulk Hogan in his $140 million invasion of privacy suit against Gawker after Gawker published Hogan\u2019s sex tape. As noted on the firm\u2019s website, they \u201cconvinced a Pinellas County jury to award Terry Bollea, professionally known as Hulk Hogan, $55 million in economic damages and another $60 million in damages for emotional distress. The jury awarded an additional $25.1 million in punitive damages, making the verdict one of the largest contested verdicts in Pinellas County history.\u201d 01 \u2013 Complaint W-o Exhibits (00125593xBEB76) by Breitbart News on Scribd ",

            "content": " A former Republican congressman tells Breitbart News that top Wisconsin Republican power brokers, including Scott Walker and Reince Preibus, are using Cruz to beat Trump here so that they can broker the convention to pick Wisconsin\u2019s own Paul Ryan as the nominee. With 72 hours to go until Tuesday\u2019s primary, Trump and Palin braved the April snow to speak with urgency about their mission to defeat Cruz, who is backed by conservative movement activists as well as out-of-state Establishment types.\u00a0The Cruz campaign says that they\u2019ve seen no visible evidence of a Trump ground game or volunteer operation in the state. So Trump is relying on big rallies in front of packed crowds in auditorium halls. \u201cPeople say, I like Trump and I like Cruz. It\u2019s not even a fair comparison. I\u2019m so much better,\u201d Trump said at a rally in Wausau, mocking Washington lobbyists with \u201cCruz\u201d tattoos on their foreheads as he stood in front of a group of teenage guys in faux-Pink Floyd T-shirts bearing\u00a0the slogan \u201cTrump\u2019s Wall.\u201d \u201cBelieve me, they have him. They have him, folks,\u201d Trump said of Cruz\u2019s lobbyists. Both Trump and Palin made a fair share of Green Bay Packers references, telling anecdotes about Packers legends Jerry Kramer and Vince Lombardi (and reminding this reporter of Hunter S. Thompson\u2019s classic assessment upon meeting popular Silent Majority president Richard Nixon:\u00a0\u201cIt wasn\u2019t his factual knowledge of football that stunned me; it was his genuine interest in the game.\u201d) Trump also made kids in the audience raise their hands and promise never to do drugs. \u201cI won\u2019t say no alcohol, but take it easy on the alcohol,\u201d he added. \u201cOnce you get hooked on the alcohol or the drugs, it makes your life very hard. And if you never start taking it, you won\u2019t get hooked.\u201d  \u201cI hope I have some good years left, and I want to give back to the country. I just want to give something back. That\u2019s all it is\u2026This is an opportunity that is so awe-inspiring, to be president of the United States \u2026 If we don\u2019t make the country rich again, you\u2019re going to have your Social Security cut by Cruz and Kasich.\u201d \u201cWe have some areas that look like it\u2019s just uniform Trump, and we have others that we\u2019re actually campaigning in a little bit to see if we can get them over,\u201d Trump said. In Racine, Trump stood on stage, reading off numbers from a page of Wisconsin budget and job statistics, and said of himself, rather tellingly, \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s self-funded really since Ross Perot.\u201d \u201cWisconsin has to keep wages very depressed, if you don\u2019t keep wages depressed you\u2019re not going to hold your jobs. Which tells you, you have the wrong kinds of jobs, folks, I hate to tell you. We\u2019ll bring the jobs back that you\u2019re going to want to make a little money with.\u201d \u201cThe people get it. The people, the people, the people, really understand. The people really understand.\u201d Palin, meanwhile, took dead aim at Cruz. \u201cThese paid political hacks and consultants running these other guys\u2019 campaigns who have a track record of losing and losing and losing. But somebody\u2019s such a sucker, they keep hiring the guys and paying them hundreds of thousands of dollars to advise them on campaigns. Well, it\u2019s not going to do him any good.\u201d Will these rallies help Trump gain on Cruz, who is leading by ten points? Only time will tell. But other signs around the state are pointing to very positive things for Cruz: The Establishment Is Teaming Up With Cruz \u2014 At Least For Now Trump is fighting against Wisconsin\u2019s governor Scott Walker, who endorsed Cruz, but the problem for Trump is bigger than Walker. \u201cI think this is a three-corner bank shot. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s that much of a lovefest for Ted Cruz, but they\u2019re just using him to keep Trump below 1,237 delegates so they can broker the convention for Paul Ryan,\u201d former congressman Scott Klug told Breitbart News. \u201cReince is very close to Ryan, and Walker is very close to Ryan, so I think it starts there. I know Wisconsin politics well and I know the players well and I think this is well orchestrated,\u201d Klug said. \u201cThey had the opportunity to volunteer for the Cruz campaign for a long time, but it\u2019s only happened in the last couple days.\u201d The Washington-based Club for Growth PAC is running a TV ad in the state that makes perfectly clear why Ted Cruz is all of a sudden getting the support of Mitt Romney, Lindsey Graham, Jeb Bush, and other people who never would have endorsed him in a million years had Trump not gotten into the race. If people vote for Ted Cruz, then the party can stop Trump from getting 1,237 delegates, and then the Republicans can broker the convention in Cleveland, where Cruz will be on his own on the second ballot. Cruz is already racing to win a second-ballot majority among delegates in order to stave off an Establishment power play that could see Paul Ryan or another candidate step in to take the nomination. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVNOu00vYpM Trump attacked the Club for Growth\u2019s numbers-minded antics. Trump challenged the group\u2019s math.   Cruz Has A Highly Organized Ground Game \u201cCruz is doing well in the Milwaukee suburbs, where about 40 percent of the raw numbers in Wisconsin come out of,\u201d former Republican congressman Scott Klug told Breitbart News. \u201cThe northern towns, the rural part of the state, that\u2019s where Trump\u2019s strength is \u2026 I\u2019d be stunned if Cruz doesn\u2019t win the First, which is Ryan\u2019s district.\u201d Milwaukee-area conservative radio hosts like Charlie Sykes are hammering away at Trump, and activists are hitting the ground. Heidi Cruz and Carly Fiorina have teamed up to barnstorm around the state, riling up volunteers at the campaign\u2019s more than thirty makeshift offices in the state. On a snowy day this week in Wausau, Heidi and Carly showed up to greet about fifty people in a crowded rental unit on the outskirts of town. Heidi was professional to a tee, doggedly going from handshake to handshake with the predominately elderly and older middle-aged group. \u201cTed is so great at standing up for what we believe in,\u201d Heidi said when asked casually if she was getting tired of the campaign trail, adding that Ted\u2019s passion keeps them both energized. Another woman told Heidi that she was praying for Ted. Heidi thanked her. \u201cAnd thank you for putting action to all these prayers too, because we have packed offices all over the state,\u201d Heidi added, concluding that she believes her husband will win Wisconsin. The people there were perfectly friendly but also symptomatic of the Midwestern distaste for coastal outsiders, mocking among themselves Donald Trump\u2019s orange face. A particularly entrepreneurial 17-year-old volunteer named Bethany Torstenson said that she aspires to one day be a \u201clittle like\u201d each of the more constitutionally-inclined Republican candidates, \u201cexcept for Trump.\u201d She says, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be part of the circus.\u201d Trump\u2019s East Coast Style\u00a0Does Not Adapt Easily Here Let\u2019s say you\u2019re a reporter from the East Coast (a fiscally conservative one) and you show up to a bar in Madison, Wisconsin wearing a suit sans tie. A guy might look at you and say \u201cI hear the [stock] market is up!\u201d while other people in the bar look away from you. The bartender might not come over to serve you right away. And then you take the hint and leave. No, Wisconsin is not filled to the brim with such mean-spirited hipsters, but people throughout the state \u2014 like in Iowa \u2014 do\u00a0have a fundamental distrust for people from the East Coast. Who from the deep Midwest can try to deny it? Fast-talking New Yorkers are viewed with suspicion at best. A candidate talking about his \u201cwinning\u201d poll numbers all the time is considered tacky. A lot of people in Wisconsin \u2014 from the well-represented Bernie Sanders Left to the pro-Cruz Religious Right \u2014 really, really, really don\u2019t like Donald Trump. Consider the states where Trump has won his most significant victories. Trump, the redheaded Scots-Irish candidate, won New Hampshire as well as Alabama, Massachusetts alongside South Carolina. These are East Coast people, and whether they\u2019re in New England or the Deep South, many of them are Catholics or at least rooted in the fiery Scotch-Irish tradition. Trump has consistently led the Republican field among Catholics. Trump\u00a0leads Hillary Clinton among Catholics,\u00a0even though a substantial plurality of Catholics are Democrats. The Germanic Protestants of Wisconsin, raised in a modest culture like in Iowa (where Trump only got 24 percent in a loss), are wary of Trump. They don\u2019t like the bombast. They don\u2019t like the ego. They don\u2019t like the circus. And they really don\u2019t like New York. How about Lutherans, whose presence in Wisconsin makes it one of the top Lutheran states alongside Minnesota and North and South Dakota? Forget it. Trump draws Lutheran peace protesters. It\u2019s not his personality type. Also,\u00a0Wisconsin is a predominately white state that has very few Mexicans in it (as of 2008, Hispanics made up only five percent of the state and were mostly found in clusters). Therefore, the idea of a border wall with Mexico is removed from the experience and concerns of most of these people. Don\u2019t expect immigration to have anywhere near the impact in Wisconsin that it had in Arizona, where Trump won in a landslide.",

            "author": "Ken Klukowski",
            "content": " \u201cThis case is ultimately about the First Amendment, but the subject matter implicated in this appeal is far less dramatic: rules of procedure and pleading standards,\u201d began the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Judge Jed Rakoff of the Southern District of New York, appointed by Bill Clinton, had dismissed Palin\u2019s complaint for failing to state a plausible claim. A three-judge panel of the Second Circuit disagreed, reinstating the lawsuit. The lawsuit arose in the aftermath of depraved Tucson shooter Jared Loughner\u2019s murderous rampage in Tucson in 2011 \u2013 killing six people, including a federal judge, John Roll \u2013 and seriously wounding Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-AZ). Palin\u2019s political committee, SarahPAC, had run ads surrounding Congress\u2019s voting on the Affordable Care Act (aka, \u201cObamacare\u201d), with \u201ca map that superimposed the image of a crosshairs target over certain Democratic congressional districts.\u201d \u201cIn the wake of the Loughner shooting, some speculated that the shooting was connected to the crosshairs map,\u201d the Second Circuit continued. \u201cNo evidence ever emerged to establish the link,\u201d Judge John Walker wrote for the panel. \u201cIn fact, the criminal investigation of Loughner indicated that his animosity toward Representative Giffords had arisen before SarahPAC published the map.\u201d When left-wing fanatic James Hodgkinson opened fire in 2017 in an effort to assassinate Republican congressmen, severely wounding conservative Steve Scalise (R-LA), the New York Times\u00a0ran an editorial citing SarahPAC\u2019s ad from 2011, commented that the \u201clink to political incitement was clear\u201d to the Loughner shooting, then went on to discuss Hodgkinson\u2019s act of domestic terrorism. \u201cThe Times\u00a0faced an immediate backlash for publishing the editorial,\u201d Walker continued, noting that the paper later published a correction which admitted that in fact, \u201cno such link was established.\u201d Palin sued the Times\u00a0for defamation in federal court 12 days after the editorial ran, and the Times\u00a0filed a motion to dismiss the case. The case then \u201ctook an unusual procedural turn,\u201d the New York City-based appeals court observed, when the judge \u201cheld an evidentiary hearing on the motion to dismiss.\u201d Under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a district court must generally accept the facts alleged by a plaintiff as true, and cannot dismiss a case for failing to make a claim unless, even if all the claimed facts are true, the law would still be on the side of the defendant. \u201cOn August 29, 2017, the district court, relying on evidence adduced at the hearing, granted the Times\u2019 motion to dismiss,\u201d the panel recounted. The appellate court noted that a district court cannot consider evidence outside a plaintiff\u2019s complaint in a motion to dismiss, and instead must convert that motion to one for summary judgment if the judge wants to decide the case at that stage. However, once a court moves into summary-judgment territory, both sides must have the opportunity to present their evidence and argument. \u201cEven if the plaintiff had been given notice and the court had explicitly converted the motion to one for summary judgment,\u201d the Second Circuit reasoned, \u201cwe would still have to vacate because the district court\u2019s opinion relied on credibility determinations not permissible at any stage before trial.\u201d The Second Circuit concluded that Palin stated a plausible claim of defamation, and must now be given an opportunity to present evidence to make her case. The panel in question was comprised of two Republican-appointed judges and one judge appointed by Barack Obama. The decision in Palin\u2019s favor was unanimous. \u201cThis is \u2013 and always has been \u2013 a case about media accountability,\u201d Palin\u2019s lawyer Libby Locke told Breitbart News. \u201cWe are pleased with the court\u2019s decision, and look forward to starting discovery and ultimately proceeding to trial.\u201d The case is Palin v. New York Times Co., No. 17-3801-cv in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, and No. 17-cv-4853 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.

            "content": " Breitbart News has independently confirmed an earlier report in\u00a0People magazine, which reported that Palin was not sent an invitation and was told through intermediaries to stay away from the ceremony. McCain fundraiser\u00a0Carla Eudy confirmed to\u00a0People that Palin had not been invited \u2014 possibly,\u00a0People speculated, at the behest of the McCain family. The news comes on the tenth anniversary of the date in 2008 when Palin was announced as McCain\u2019s pick for vice president. Palin now joins President Donald Trump on the list of those barred from the funeral. But unlike Trump, Palin never feuded with McCain and never criticized him. When news broke on Saturday of McCain\u2019s passing, Palin said, \u201cToday we lost an American original. Sen. John McCain was a maverick and a fighter, never afraid to stand for his beliefs. John never took the easy path in life \u2014 and through sacrifice and suffering he inspired others to serve something greater than self. \u201cJohn McCain was my friend. I will remember the good times. My family and I send prayers for Cindy and the McCain family.\u201d Last year, when McCain was reported to have\u00a0said that he regretted choosing Palin instead of Sen. Joe Lieberman (I-CT), Palin described the news as a \u201cgut punch\u201d but refused to blame McCain personally, telling the UK\u00a0Daily Mail that she blamed his \u201cghostwriters\u201d for such reports. When McCain selected Palin as his running mate, the two had both built reputations as corruption-busting \u201cmaverick\u201d leaders who were not afraid to buck their own parties. After the 2008 election, they moved in separate political directions. Palin became an inspirational figure for the Tea Party and for grassroots conservatives in general. McCain campaigned as a conservative border hawk in his 2010 re-election race but became a harsh critic of the Tea Party, calling Sens. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Rand Paul (R-KY) \u201cwacko birds.\u201d Many in the Beltway blamed Palin for McCain\u2019s loss in 2008 \u2014 even though Barack Obama had benefited from a sudden financial crisis and a biased press corps. That view seemed to have seeped into McCain\u2019s own thinking. Still, Palin never took offense and always honored McCain. Even after being excluded from the funeral, she declined to criticize him. People quoted a source close to the Palin family: \u201c[O]ut of respect for Sen. McCain and his family we have nothing to add at this point. The Palin family will always cherish their friendship with the McCains and hold those memories dear.\u201d McCain will be laid to rest on Sunday in Annapolis, following several days of memorial events and ceremonies.

Those of us who stuck it out, and actually live here, care about our future, and need representation.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez used her deceased father\u2019s Bronx condo on her voter registration since 2012, but has since denied reports that she doesn\u2019t live in the Manhattan borough. Meanwhile, Papazian \u2013 the daughter of Egyptian immigrants\u00a0who currently lives with her widowed mother \u2013 has accused the headline-making\u00a0freshman representative of never responding to concerned people in the district \u201cwho have serious questions about her unrealistic and unworkable policies,\u201d and claims\u00a0that she \u201chas a mostly unstaffed office in Queens, and when constituents call her office in DC to ask for help, they get phone recordings with full message boxes.\u201d WHAT CHINESE SPIES WANT FROM AMERICANS But for this Bronx Republican, it is\u00a0the incumbent\u2019s economic policies that are the driving force behind her own political aspirations. \u201cIt has been galling listening to Ocasio-Cortez push really hackneyed big government ideas that have failed around the world. These include her Green New Deal and Medicare for all,\u201d Papazian said. \u201cThis district is home to first and second-generation immigrants. It is a middle-class district, because our families came here, worked hard, bought houses, and flourished. Many of us come from families that escaped socialism. No one wants it here.\u201d And as\u00a0Papazian fears, some U.S. businesses also view the Ocasio-Cortez-led socialist economic plug as a possibility rather than\u00a0a delusional fantasy. Independent retailer Metals.com last month surveyed more than 100,000 of its members across the country to gather insights on the attitudes and behaviors of U.S. retirees aged 60 and over, with some 91.5 percent labeling the Democrat party \u201cas more socialist\u201d since the 2018 election. \u201cAs Democrats control the House, they are becoming openly bold about socialist programs \u2013 like Medicare for All, confiscatory tax rates for top earners and a Green New Deal, their hard-left turn is no longer a matter for discernment,\u201d said Metals Vice President Deric Scott. A\u00a0Gallup poll last year found that more Democrats \u2013 some 57 percent \u2013 now have a more \u201cpositive\u201d view of the word socialism than they did ten years ago amid the financial collapse.

She also noted that the issues she intends to run on are centered on \u201cpro-growth tax policies for economic diversity, affordable private health insurance, border control as a national security issue, less government intrusion and regulation, strong defense and fewer wars\u201d and the local matter of fixing the \u201ccrumbling roads and subway system\u201d rather than bolstering the cost for vehicles heading into Manhattan as part of the Democratic Gov.

A spokesperson for Ocasio-Cortez did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but her representatives have previously stated that they \u201cwelcome\u201d competition and Democratic values.",

            "content": "Donald Trump has announced his team of economic advisers, a group that includes many of the people already helping his campaign. It includes John Paulson, a hedge fund billionaire who made his fortune betting against subprime mortgages as the American economy headed toward collapse in 2007; Tom Barrack, a real estate investor and close friend of Trump who has been raising money for a super PAC supporting the billionaire candidate, and Steven Mnuchin, a New York investor who is Trump's national finance chairman. The team is being led by Trump's national policy director, Stephen Miller, along with Dan Kowalski, a former staffer on the Senate Budget Committee. But the list is as notable for who is not on it as who is: It is comprised solely of men, with no women -- just like the campaign's public list of foreign policy advisers. It also excludes many prominent Republican economists who have advised past candidates. Trump's announcement Friday came as the government reported that U.S. employers added a healthy 255,000 jobs last month. That could bolster Democrat Hillary Clinton's claim that the state of the U.S. economy under President Barack Obama is not nearly as dire as described by Trump. On Monday, Trump will deliver an economic speech in Detroit focusing on \"empowering Americans by freeing up the necessary tools for everyone to gain economically,\" the campaign said. Trump has faced criticism from Clinton over his reluctance to provide detailed policy proposals. He released a tax plan in September that proposed cutting rates across the board and reducing the amount paid by the wealthiest Americans and corporations. Analysts, however, said it would disproportionately benefit the wealthy and dramatically boost America's debt, despite Trump's assurances to the contrary.",

A Parliament committee agreed last month to support amending Canada's sanctions rules to include rights violators, acting in honor of the Russian whistleblower Sergei Magnitsky, who died in a Moscow prison in 2009 after accusing officials of a $230 million tax fraud. Russia's presidential council on human rights said the 37-year-old Magnitsky, who was a lawyer for Browder's Hermitage Capital firm, was beaten and denied medical treatment while in jail. The government's decision is bound to further strain relations with Russia, which has reacted strongly to the imposition of Magnitsky-style legislation elsewhere. After U.S. President Barrack Obama signed such legislation into law in 2012, Russia responded by banning American citizens from adopting Russian children. The U.S. Magnitsky Act sanctioned five Russian officials involved in alleged human rights violations in the Magnitsky case. Ottawa and Moscow have their own differences, which includes a Russian travel ban on Freeland.",

            "content": "This weekend, Dr. Julie Gerberding resigned as director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and will be replaced by an interim deputy director. I hope that President-elect Barrack Obama's replacement will be made on the basis of merit rather than politics. The CDC is one of the major branches of the Department of Health and Human Services. One of its major roles is to make sure America is prepared for new health threats. One of its major focuses has been on disease prevention and therefore it is my opinion that its new director should have strong roots in clinical medicine as well as research. The CDC has turned into a very large bureaucracy with offices in 54 countries around the world, and even though it is one of the best run government agencies in the country, it must reengineer itself to meet the health challenges of the new Century. As we look at where America is in terms of disease prevention, these are the areas where we need to do a better job_ heart disease, diabetes, pregnancy care and bioterrorism. I've never truly understood how scientific government positions are chosen. I wish that we would have more transparency so that we can understand on what merit some of our top scientists are chosen. I have recently read some of the top names that are circulating as a possible director of the CDC, which include the health directors of many of our cities, including Dr. Thomas Friedman, the health commissioner of New York City. However, I would suggest that if we really want change to occur in the CDC, the new director should have a strong clinical research background. So here's my list of some candidates that I hope will be considered: Dr. Charles Lockwood - Chairman of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Yale University. Dr. David R. Bickers - Chairman of Dermatology at Columbia University. Dr. William C. Wood - Chief of Surgery at Emory Dr. Michael Lincoff - Director of Clinical Research at Cleveland Clinic These are a few great scientists I hope the Obama transition team will look at. And, as I said, politics should not play a role in choosing our top scientists - and I hope it doesn't.",

They want to hear something from him that says to them, you know what, it's going to be OK. But instead we are hearing from the combative Donald Trump. TOM BARRACK, COLONY CAPITAL CEO: And I understand that the feeling is that the president-elect himself is fueling this because he continues to be adversarial on issues he's concerned with. But at the same time. (CROSSTALK) COSTELLO: He is entrenching Americans in their camp. (END VIDEO CLIP) Oh my God! She is the only Costello less serious than Lou. Now I get it. Trump sounds mean and Obama is so soothing he is like a cup of chamomile tea that drones people. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: We have traveled the world together. We did a few singles, a few doubles together. I have offered advice that I thought was pretty sound, like don't do stupid stuff. And even when you complained about my long answers, I just want you to know that the only reason they were long was because you asked six-part questions. (END VIDEO CLIP) Ha-ha-ha. Now, to that Dr. Jekyll, Trump is Mr. Hyde. He is loud, impulsive, a pissed off Creamsicle. The media says he is dividing America. Yet, few minded when Hillary called half of America irredeemable. Republicans are always demonized. Now, for once, we demonize back. Here is \"Joyless\" Behar from the knitting circle in hell. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, \"THE VIEW\"/ABC) JOY BEHAR, CO- HOST: Let's talk about what's going on right now because the inauguration of a certain person is happening on January 20th. (LAUGHTER) SUNNY HOSTIN, CO-HOST: He who shall not be named. BEHAR: Right. It's happening January 20th. And there are millions of people who did not vote for him and who feel frightened. I run into people all the time. \"Joy, keep talking, we are scared, we don't know what to do.\" (END VIDEO CLIP) No one says \"keep talking\" to Joy. Oh, the good old days when only liberals scared us -- the Weather Underground, the Black Panthers, FALN. The FALN killed many, they maimed cops, they terrorized cities. And now, President Obama just releases one. And you thought Bill Ayers was just a fluke. The lesson: When the left kills, it's romantic. A Republican is rude? Now that's evil. So as young leftists threaten campus security to a point where right-wing events are canceled and anti-Trump leftists plan to attack inaugural events, the media keep saying, \"People, beware of Trump.\" Perhaps projecting panic masks their bias. What the media does to Trump is what they did the cops -- say the police are really harmful, then later ask why people are so scared of the police. So they treat a Trump White House like a zombie apocalypse, hoping the mentality spreads. But one thing is clear: Judging from the last presser, the press adores President Obama. They still do. Yet they fear Trump. Change is good.",

I work with him.\" Reid also said the president-elect should have told lawmakers about the selection of CIA director-designate Leon Panetta ahead of time. He said incoming White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel \"would be the first to admit that he didn't tell enough people on this.\" Meanwhile, a day after what many analysts called the \"Roland Burris circus\" rolled up to Capitol Hill \u2014 embarrassing Democratic leaders after they refused to seat Burris \u2014 Reid is proclaiming that Tuesday was a great day for his party. He says in a news release: \"Yesterday was a terrific day to be a Democrat... a true testament to all the hard work you put in to ensure a Democratic victory last November.\" Hot Seat As congressional Democrats deal with simmering tensions on Capitol Hill, New York Democrats are fighting a battle of their own. The New York Times reports a top aide to State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo is urging officials not to embrace Caroline Kennedy as a replacement for Senator Hillary Clinton, even though Cuomo said he was staying out of the competition. Clinton will vacate her Senate seat if she is confirmed as secretary of state. Sources \u2014 who spoke on the condition of anonymity \u2013\u2014 tell The Times that Joseph Percoco said, \"Don't you think it should be someone who understands upstate? Shouldn\u2019t it be somebody who knows New York better?\" A top union official says Percoco suggested to him that Cuomo wanted the job saying, \"You should, wink-wink, nudge-nudge, know that he kind of wants it.\" A Cuomo spokesman denies any effort to undermine Kennedy\u2019s Senate ambitions. Similar Taste We told you Tuesday that Pepsi\u2019s new logo is causing a stir because it closely resembles President-elect Obama's campaign artwork. But the soft drink company is not the only business that appears to try piggyback on the Obama success. Ice-cream maker Ben & Jerry's is renaming its butter pecan ice cream \"Yes Pecan!\u201d \u2014 which sounds a lot like Mr. Obama's campaign slogan \"Yes We Can.\" The company's founders endorsed the senator in February. The Ben & Jerry's Web site describes the renamed flavor as \"amber waves of buttery ice cream with roasted non-partisan pecans.\" Call Off the Dogs And finally, an annual sled dog race in Frazee, Minnesota has been canceled. It\u2019s been called off twice before because of a lack of snow. But this time, the race has been abandoned because there is too much snow. There are reports of record snowfall from across the country this winter \u2014 a blow to global warming theorists. And Frazee is no different. Organizers say there is so much snow that they cannot prepare the tracks. The cancellation is a blow to the town since the event attracted up to 3,000 visitors last year. \u2014 FOX News Channel's Zachary Kenworthy contributed to this report.",

He might have two faces, but we know all too well who the true Mitt Romney is.\" Best Pix of the Week In the lead-up to the Florida GOP primary, the two groups also released an ad in Orlando and Tampa attacking Romney.\u00a0Romney decisively won the primary Tuesday night. Romney supported strict immigration laws approved in Arizona and Alabama, yet in Florida played up his Mexican-American roots. \u201cMitt Romney is willing to do and say anything in whatever language and in whatever forum to get elected,\" Eliseo Medina, SEIU Secretary Treasurer, said during a conference call Wednesday. Airing in the Las Vegas and Reno areas, the ads will focus more on economic issues important to Latinos, rather than immigration. \"Keep in mind that we are looking at general election voters,\" said Brandon Davis, SEIU National Political Director. Jobless Mexicana Flight Attendants Pose for Calendar The struggling economy is a key issue Nevada because the state, once the fastest growing economy in the country, now has the highest unemployment rate in the nation. \"On the one hand, Romney is a multimillionaire who pays an unfairly low tax rate,\" the ad says. \"But, on the other hand, he accuses hard working immigrants of being opportunistic, declaring that they're just here looking for handouts.\" Romney's spokeswoman, Amanda Henneberg, told the Wall Street Journal that the ads were \"a dishonest smear from President Obama\u2019s liberal allies and a desperate attempt to distract from his abysmal record.

            "content": " President Trump invoked on Sunday past pro-border security comments by two unlikely political adversaries -- Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton -- as the ongoing partial federal government shutdown over border wall funding enters its third week. In a pair of early-morning posts on Twitter, Trump,\u00a0who later headed to a meeting with advisers at Camp David to discuss border security,\u00a0also seemingly addressed reports that the prolonged shutdown will end up costing the government more than the $5 billion he has requested for the wall, writing that in the end, a \"properly planned and constructed Wall will pay for itself many times a year!\" Trump's remarks underscored his apparent\u00a0unwillingnesss to compromise on securing at least some of the border wall funding he has demanded, despite the insistence of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that Democrats will never pay for a wall. However, in an interview\u00a0broadcast Sunday on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney told host Chuck Todd that Trump \"was willing to agree, and he mentioned this at the Rose Garden press conference, to take a concrete wall off the table.\" Mulvaney had met with senior congressional officials on Saturday to try to make progress on a compromise, although he suggested the encounter had been mostly unproductive. IN SITUATION ROOM MEETING, SCHUMER, PELOSI INTERRUPT DHS SECRETARY WITHIN 5 SECONDS \"Again, what's driving this is the president's desire to change the conditions at the border,\" Mulvaney said. \"And if he has to give up a concrete wall, replace it with a steel fence in order to do that so that Democrats can say, 'See? He's not building a wall anymore' that should help us move in the right direction.\" On Twitter, the president intimated that\u00a0cynical political considerations were motivating Democrats' rejection of wall funding. Pelosi and other Democrats have suggested they would be willing to fund general border security efforts, but not a wall. (The president has told Democrats the shutdown could last more than a year.) \u201c'We simply cannot allow people to pour into the United States undetected, undocumented, unchecked...'\u201d Barrack Obama, 2005,\" Trump wrote on Sunday, quoting the former president in 2005. Then-Sen. Obama made the remarks at a press conference with then-Florida GOP\u00a0Sen.\u00a0Mel Martinez, as part of a bipartisan effort to address illegal immigration. PELOSI TO DHS SECRETARY: 'I REJECT\u00a0YOUR FACTS' Obama's full quote at the time: \"We simply cannot allow people to pour into the United States, undetected, undocumented, unchecked and circumventing the line of people who are waiting patiently, diligently and lawfully to become immigrants in this country.\" \"We all agree on the need to better secure the border and to punish employers who choose to hire illegal immigrants,\" Obama added.\u00a0\"We are a generous and welcoming people, here in the United States, but those who enter the country illegally, and those who employ them, disrespect the rule of law and they are showing disregard for those who are following the law.\" Obama went on to advocate for imposing a \"hefty fine\" on those already in the country illegally, as well as tighter border security measures. In his post, Trump also provided a partial quote from former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, emphasizing her support for the\u00a0Secure Fence Act of 2006. That legislation passed by an overwhelming 80-19 majority, and was backed by Obama, as well. \"I voted, when I was a Senator, to build a barrier to try to prevent illegal immigrants from coming in...\u201d Hillary Clinton, 2015,\" Trump wrote. At a campaign stop in November 2015, Clinton told a crowd: \"I voted numerous times when I was a senator to spend money to build a barrier to try to prevent illegal immigrants from coming in. And I do think you have to control your borders.\" Trump continued: \"The only reason they do not want to build a Wall is that Walls Work! 99% of our illegal Border crossings will end, crime in our Country will go way down and we will save billions of dollars a year! A properly planned and constructed Wall will pay for itself many times a year!\" Last week, former White House Chief of Staff John Kelly flatly asserted\u00a0in an interview with The Los Angeles Times that the president's proposed border project \"is not a wall\" and that all plans for a concrete wall were abandoned long ago -- directly contradicting the White House's repeated claims. In a series of Twitter posts last month, Trump insisted that \"we are not building a Concrete Wall, we are building artistically designed steel slats, so that you can easily see through it.\" But Kelly's comments were seemingly at odds with the president's multiple tweets calling for \"money to finish the Wall,\" as well as his promises during and after the 2016 presidential campaign. \"To be honest, it\u2019s not a wall,\u201d Kelly said\u00a0in\u00a0an interview with The Los Angeles Times. \u201cThe president still says \u2018wall\u2019 \u2014 oftentimes frankly he\u2019ll say \u2018barrier\u2019 or \u2018fencing,\u2019 now he\u2019s tended toward steel slats. But we left a solid concrete wall early on in the administration, when we asked people what they needed and where they needed it.\" Pelosi, after regaining the speakership this week, made clear that no wall of any kind was on the table. \"We\u2019re not doing a wall,\" Pelosi told reporters. \"Does anybody have any doubt about that? We are not doing a wall. So that\u2019s that.\u00a0It has nothing to do with politics. It has to do with: The wall is an immorality between countries. It\u2019s an old way of thinking [and] it isn\u2019t cost-effective.\u201d At one point during a meeting at the White House on Wednesday, according to the\u00a0Wall Street Journal, Pelosi interrupted\u00a0Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen while she was citing statistics related to the border, including how many criminal illegal immigrants attempted to enter the U.S. last year. \u201cI reject your facts,\u201d Pelosi told Nielsen.",

            "content": " Presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders has pledged to American workers that he would institute a $15-per-hour minimum wage if he wins the White House in 2020. But unionized workers on Sanders\u2019 own campaign say they wish he would start now -- by paying a higher wage to them. According to a report, members of Sanders\u2019 staff have been using the senator's\u00a0own campaign rhetoric against him as they try to wrestle more pay from the self-described democratic socialist. BERNIE SANDERS SAYS HIS $40 TRILLION MEDICARE-FOR-ALL PLAN WOULD HELP US SAVE MONEY In a letter to Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir, the campaign staffers claim they \u201ccannot be expected to build the largest grassroots organizing program in American history while making poverty wages,\u201d the Washington Post reported. \u201cGiven our campaign\u2019s commitment to fighting for a living wage of at least $15.00 an hour,\u201d the letter continues, \u201cwe believe it is only fair that the campaign would carry through this commitment to its own field team.\u201d According to the Post, field organizers claim that their long hours working on behalf of Sanders drop their actual pay to about $13 per hour. \u201cMany field staffers are barely managing to survive financially,\u201d the union letter says, \u201cwhich is severely impacting our team\u2019s productivity and morale. Some field organizers have already left the campaign as a result.\u201d But when contacted by the Post on Thursday, Shakir seemed to paint a different picture. \u201cWe know our campaign offers wages and benefits competitive with other campaigns, as is shown by the latest fundraising reports,\u201d Shakir said in a statement, according to the Post. \u201cEvery member of the campaign, from the candidate on down, joined this movement in order to defeat Donald Trump and transform America. Bernie Sanders is the most pro-worker and pro-labor candidate running for president.\u201d As for Sanders himself, the Post said it was unclear whether the candidate was aware of the grievances among his campaign staff. The Post report surfaced on the same day that the Democrat-controlled House voted in favor of a bill to gradually raise the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour. The current federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour, unchanged since 2009. The situation in the Sanders campaign seems a far cry from March, when Sanders\u2019 campaign proudly announced that its employees had chosen to be represented by the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 400. In May, the campaign ratified a union contract with the workers, making it the first presidential campaign in history to do so. At the time, the campaign touted \"unprecedented standards for campaign workers,\" including pay transparency, a defined wage scale, access to mental health care coverage, an anti-discrimination policy that protects immigrant and transgender staff members, and a \"pro-worker grievance and arbitration process.\u201d Meanwhile, President Trump has offered a different perspective on conditions facing U.S. workers. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP During a campaign rally in Greenville, N.C., earlier this week, the president said 6 million new jobs had been created in the U.S. since he was elected and the nation\u2019s unemployment rate of 3.7 percent was at its lowest point in decades. Republican leaders have said a minimum wage hike would be \u201cdevastating\u201d for middle-class families, citing research from the Congressional Budget Office. The CBO report found that the Democrats\u2019 bill would boost wages for about 17 million people \u2013 but it would also reduce business income, raise consumer prices and reduce the nation\u2019s output. Overall, the CBO said the move would reduce real family income by about $9 billion in 2025 \u2013 or 0.1 percent.

            "content": " Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., proudly announced this year that his presidential campaign would be the first in history to have a unionized workforce. Well, he just became the first presidential candidate in history to face a labor revolt from his unionized workforce. The Sanders campaign workers union, United Food & Commercial Workers Local 400, complained that field organizers are \"making poverty wages\" and that \"many field staffers are barely managing to survive financially.\" Because field organizers are working 60 hours a week, according to the union, their annual salary of $36,000 works out to $13 an hour -- well below the $15-an-hour federal minimum wage Sanders has called for. BERNIE SANDERS' UNIONIZED 2020 STAFFERS TO RECEIVE PAY RAISE It gets worse. When the Sanders campaign offered to raise salaries to that level, the union rejected the offer. Why? Because \"the raise would have elevated field staff to a pay level responsible for paying more of their own health-care costs.\" It turns out that Sanders pays only 85 percent of health care premiums for campaign staff making more than $36,000 \u2013 despite campaigning on a promise of free health care for all with \"no premiums, no deductibles, no co-payments, no out-of-pocket expenses.\" So, what was Sanders's solution? First, he cut the hours of his field staffers from 60 to about 43 a week -- which meant the campaign could say it was paying $15 an hour without actually increasing field organizers' pay. Then on Monday, his campaign finally gave in and agreed to raise salaries to $42,000, preserve full health premium coverage and limit workers' hours to 50 per week. During the dispute, Sanders's campaign defended its policies, declaring: \"We know our campaign offers wages and benefits competitive with other campaigns.\" Well, McDonald's offers wages competitive with other fast-food chains, but that has not been good enough for Sanders. He has\u00a0marched with McDonald's workers, and attended Walmart shareholder meetings, to demand they be more generous with their workforces. How could he demand those companies provide pay and benefits that he was resisting giving his own employees? Now the union has forced Sanders to capitulate on wages and health care. But why stop there? The Sanders union seems to be suffering from a lack of imagination. If union organizers really want to hold Sanders to his own standards, then a $15 minimum wage and premium-free health care should be only the beginning. Sanders has promised to cover the cost of prescription drugs and make sure \"no one in America pays over $200 a year for the medicine they need.\" He has promised to pay for \"universal childcare and pre-kindergarten.\" He has promised free college, because \"you are not truly free when the vast majority of good-paying jobs require a degree that requires taking out tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt to obtain.\" Sanders has promised to \"free generations of Americans from the outrageous burden of student loans by canceling all existing student debt.\" Is he setting an example by providing all these benefits to workers on his campaign? Of course not. Because if he did, his campaign would quickly run out of cash. Ah, but there's the rub. As former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher famously put it, \"the trouble with socialism is that eventually you run out of other people's money.\" A political campaign literally runs on other people's money. It is bare-bones operation, in which staffers choose to work ridiculous hours for low pay, and rely on donations from supporters to get the candidate's message out. In Sanders's case, the majority of his donations come from small donors \u2013 ordinary Americans who are sacrificing their hard-earned money to help get him elected, not to fund social welfare for political operatives. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Every dollar his campaign spends on higher pay and free stuff for campaign workers is a dollar not spent on campaign ads in Iowa and New Hampshire. And if his campaign can't get those ads on the air, then Sanders will lose \u2013 and his entire team will lose their jobs, their benefits and their chances of a cushy White House job. Then they won't ever get access to the United States Treasury and the chance to really\u00a0spend other people's money. So, we should all be grateful to the UFCW Local 400 for pulling more Sanders campaign money off the airwaves and into the pockets of Sanders's field workers, while limiting the hours they can work to spread his socialist message. They've done the country a great service. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY MARC THIESSEN",

Kamala Harris and Cory Booker expressed strong reservations about the technology's potential ability to fuel racial bias in a letter to the Federal Trade Commission last September. WARREN WON'T SUPPORT SANDERS WASHINGTON POST-BIAS CLAIMS \"Banning facial recognition is not a radical idea. It's common sense. Allowing government agencies to build a face-scanning panopticon with no oversight or accountability is reckless and puts people in danger,\" Greer said. ",

Bernie Sanders\u2019 2020 presidential campaign comes word that the candidate\u2019s Iowa political director has departed as well. According to reports, a Sanders aide on Wednesday confirmed that Jess Mazour, who was named Sanders\u2019 Iowa director in March, was let go from the campaign in recent weeks. The aide confirmed the departure on condition of anonymity because the aide wasn\u2019t authorized to discuss personnel matters, The Associated Press reported. SANDERS SHAKES UP CAMPAIGN LEADERSHIP IN NEW HAMPSHIRE Prior to joining the sanders campaign, Mazour was an organizer for the progressive group Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement. The Washington Post was first to report that she had left the campaign. On Sunday, the Sanders campaign announced changes to its New Hampshire leadership after backers of the campaign expressed concern that the independent U.S. senator from neighboring Vermont could lose the first-in-the-nation New Hampshire primary early next year. The campaign announced that Shannon Jackson, who ran Sanders\u2019 Senate reelection campaign in Vermont in 2018, would take over New Hampshire leadersip duties from Joe Caiazzo, who was transferred to Sanders\u2019 operation in Massachusetts, according to the Washington Times. The Caiazzo-Jackson switch came one day after the Sanders campaign parted ways with senior New Hampshire adviser Kurt Ehrenberg. The changes in the Sanders campaign coincide with the loss of a key endorsement for Sanders to rival 2020 progressive candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who this week attracted the backing of the Working Families Party -- a group that had supported Sanders in 2016. \u201cSeeing the campaign not be able to outshine Warren with WFP progressives doesn\u2019t have me questioning WFP\u2019s process,\u201d Rafael Shimunov, a 2016 Sanders volunteer and past national creative director for WFP told Politico. \u201cIt has me questioning where the Bernie campaign could have done better, because I want to make sure the strongest candidate unmasks Biden and unseats Trump.\u201d CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP A Fox News Poll released Wednesday shows that Warren has pulled virtually even with Sanders in second place behind former Vice President Joe Biden, with Sanders attracting support from 18 percent of respondents, Warren 16 percent, and Biden leading with 29 percent.

But Betsy DeVos isn\u2019t just any Education Secretary.\u00a0 And her speech on Thursday at George Mason University\u2019s Antonin Scalia Law School wasn\u2019t just any speech. Because DeVos was saying President Obama got it wrong, and it\u2019s time to change how sexual assault is dealt with on campus.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cInstead of working with schools\u201d as she put it, \u201cthe prior administration weaponized the Office for Civil Rights.\u201d Critics claim she\u2019ll be turning her back on rape victims if she overturns the system now in place.\u00a0 But in reality, what she\u2019d be doing is setting it right. On April 4, 2011, the Department of Education\u2019s Office for Civil Rights sent a \u201cDear Colleague\u201d letter to campuses setting up new requirements for sexual assault policy.\u00a0 From now on, the standard of evidence for campus tribunals would be the lowest possible\u2014a \u201cpreponderance of the evidence.\u201d This was a unilateral move on the part of the Obama administration, not backed by any legislation recently passed by Congress, but based on their new interpretation of decades-old Title IX, which forbids sexual discrimination in education. The Dear Colleague letter was a \u201csignificant guidance document,\u201d and did not have the force of law. But it couldn\u2019t be ignored\u2014any college that defied the administration could find its funding cut. What followed, under the Department of Education guidelines, was a lack of due process norms that are the foundation of our legal system. At various campuses, the accused were not allowed legal representation, had no right to see the evidence against them, had no right to introduce certain exculpatory evidence, had no power to cross-examine witnesses, had no protection against self-incrimination. And all the while these cases were often being tried by people with little expertise in the area, though some were activists with strong political views on the matter.\u00a0 Sexual crimes are tricky enough for the regular court system to handle\u2014colleges seemed overwhelmed with the task. Many of the accused were found responsible\u2014though they didn\u2019t feel they got a fair chance to defend themselves\u2014and were expelled, a black mark against them in any future endeavor.\u00a0 Numerous students accused of sexual assault have sued their colleges. Schools have paid out millions in settlements, and in some cases were forced to reinstate expelled students. It\u2019s results like these that helped convince DeVos of the need for change. \u00a0But that didn\u2019t stop those who defend the present regime from claiming DeVos is on the side of rape deniers. However, the Secretary of Education is simply trying to establish a proper balance. In recent months, she\u2019s met with both victims of assault, and with the wrongly accused, stating \u201cAll their stories are important.\u201d And in her speech, she made it clear both sides must be listened to.\u00a0 \u201cEvery survivor of sexual misconduct must be taken seriously.\u00a0 Every student accused of sexual misconduct must know that guilt is not predetermined. These are non-negotiable principles.\u201d There\u2019s no simple way to deal with the complex issue of sexual assault on campus, but any solution should look at the problem honestly and impartially, without putting a thumb on the scales of justice.\u00a0 Reform will be tricky, but the speech DeVos just gave is a good first step.",

            "content": "Harvard University students staged a protest as Education Secretary Betsy DeVos delivered a speech Thursday on school choice. Some held up fists. One held up a sign reading in red ink: \u2018White supremacist.\u201d Others called for protections for victims of campus sexual assault. DeVos last week revoked Obama administration guidance that instructed colleges on how to investigate sexual assault cases on college campuses. DeVos said policy was skewed against those accused of assault and had \u201cweaponized\u201d the Education Department to \u201cwork against schools and against students.\u201d DeVos did not stop her speech to address the protesters but later took some questions from the audience. The Associated Press reported the protest was mostly silent, though some students snapped their fingers or cheered in support of some questions. HHS SECRETARY TOM PRICE RESIGNS OVER PRIVATE PLANE TRIPS Asked about protections for transgender students, DeVos said she is committed to making sure all students are safe. Earlier this year, she rescinded guidance that allowed transgender students to use bathrooms that matched their gender identity. \"With respect to any student that feels unsafe or discriminated against in their school, that is the last thing we want and the Office for Civil Rights at the Department of Education continues to hear and work with the schools that have any of those issues to deal with,\" DeVos said. \"And we are committed to doing that on behalf of the students.\" DeVos said she wanted new rules on campus sexual assault to be fair to both the victims and the accused. She was asked by a student how much her net worth was expected to increase due to school choice. Devos responded: \"I have written lots of checks to support giving parents and kids options to choose a school of their choice. The balance on my income has gone very much the other way and will continue to do so.\" School choice referred to efforts that give students options other than their local public schools, such as charter or private schools. Charter schools were funded by public money but usually operated by entities that were independent of school districts. DeVos was a supporter of school choice efforts in Michigan before becoming President Trump\u2019s education chief. Before she spoke, she announced $253 million in grants to expand charter schools across the country. The awards went to nine states, two state agencies and over 20 nonprofit charter management organizations. The grants were awarded as part of the Every Student Succeeds Act. TILLERSON IN CHINA TO TALK ABOUT NORTH KOREA, TRADE Tony DelaRosa, 27, a student at Harvard's Graduate School of Education, held a sign reading \"Our Students Are Not 4 Sale.\" \"We need public schools not to lose our funding and be given to charter schools,\" DelaRosa told the AP. \"Administering more charters anywhere, it's going to take funding from somewhere.\" Samantha White, a 19-year-old neurobiology major, said she came to the speech to ask DeVos why she rescinded the guidance on campus sexual assault. \"I am very upset and angry about it,\" White said. \"Sexual assault is such a huge problem on college campus already and if you are rolling this back, it makes survivors of sexual assault more vulnerable and it's more difficult for them to seek justice when there aren't these regulations.\" The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

            "content": " DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. \u2013 Boos, catcalls and the turning of backs welcomed the commencement speaker at Wednesday\u2019s Bethune-Cookman University graduation ceremony. For 20 minutes, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, President Trump\u2019s most opposed cabinet secretary nominee during confirmation hearings, endured jeers from the graduates and interruptions from the university president to calm down the crowd. At one point, President Edison Jackson even threatened to \u201csend your diplomas in the mail\u201d if the noise didn\u2019t stop. DEVOS DELIVERING COMMENCEMENT SPEED DESPITE UNREST For most of her speech, and during her receipt of an honorary degree in Human Letters, the students continued the past 10 days of contention that, of all people, she won the invite for the keynote address. In her speech, DeVos directly addressed the controversy. \"As I said, I'm grateful to be with you today,\u201d said DeVos. \"While we will undoubtedly disagree, let us do so respectfully, and let us hear each other out.\" When the historically black university announced May 1 that DeVos would be the speaker, the local NAACP, National Federation of Teachers and Florida Education Association immediately voiced outrage, arguing she\u2019s an enemy of public education, a champion of school choice, favors using tax dollars to pay for kids to attend religious, private schools and is ignorant about the origins of historically black colleges and universities. MONEY TO PREP POOR KIDS FOR COLLEGE? SORRY, WRONG SIZE TYPE That opinion comes from a statement DeVos released in February, referring to historically black colleges and universities: \u201cHBCUs are real pioneers when it comes to school choice. They are living proof that when more options are provided to students, they are afforded greater access and greater quality.\u201d Many historically black school leaders expressed shock and dismay that DeVos didn\u2019t also mention how segregation, racism and Jim Crow forced the creation of black colleges in the first place, i.e., there was no \u201cchoice.\u201d Students, alumni and the NAACP organized an online petition drive calling on DeVos to be disinvited and for Jackson and Board Chairman Joe Petcock to resign. On Wednesday, President Jackson defended the DeVos invitation, saying \u201cIt\u2019s important to understand that people will disagree, but that does not mean that you roll over and play dead because you disagree. \u00a0This is a good day for us.\u00a0Can you imagine how many institutions would love to have the secretary of education, the highest educational officer in the land, to be their commencement speaker and hopefully open new doors for this institution?\u201d Jackson added that the Department of Education controls 87 percent of Title IV funding and money is needed at historically black colleges and universities to help students graduate with degrees and impact their communities. Caylin Mason, one of Bethune-Cookman\u2019s 300-plus 2017 graduates, said she was excited about graduation: \u201cFour years..it all paid off.\u201d But when asked about the controversy over DeVos, Mason had two words. \u201cNo comment.\u201d",

Principal Ty Thompson and his teachers, welcomed the boys and girls and a special guest, Department of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos.\u00a0Secretary DeVos came to Stoneman Douglas, where Building 12 remains locked up and a crime scene, to \u201cconnect with students and teachers\u201d in the wake of the tragic shooting on Feb. 14. Her visit inside the school was closed to the press, but afterward, she spoke to the media at a Parkland hotel. \u201cIt was a very, as I said, sobering and inspiring moment and visit,\u201d DeVos said.\u00a0\u201cI come committed on behalf of this administration to continuing to work to find solutions so that no student and no parent ever has to go through what this community has had to endure.\u201d She said she heard a variety of things from the students with whom she spoke with. \u201cSome of them are doing quite well, but they all acknowledge that it\u2019s a day-to-day situation,\u201d she said. \u201cFor students who were actually in the building involved, it\u2019s very tough.\u201d School safety\u2014and what to do about it\u2014has dominated the political landscape since former student Nikolas Cruz allegedly took an Uber to the school, unpacked his AR-15 assault rifle with multiple magazines and unloaded 150 rounds inside the classrooms and hallways.\u00a0Fourteen students died, along with one teacher, the athletic director and a coach.\u00a0Sixteen others were shot and wounded. In Tallahassee, the state capital, the Senate passed its Marjory Stoneman Douglas Public Safety Act afterhours Monday night.\u00a0It calls for raising the age to buy a rifle from 18 to 21, mandates a three-day waiting period for all gun purchases, boosts funding for mental health care and aims to post armed officers at ever school. One controversial proposal, to arm teachers with guns in the classrooms if their school districts approve, was removed by the Senators. The proposal was opposed by Gov. Rick Scott.

User @Davidcrespo ignited chaos with a post of the \"cottage\" that has that has since been retweeted nearly 5,300 times and liked over 19,000 times. However, it\u2019s not the first time DeVos\u2019 22,000 square foot property has made headlines. According to Grand Rapids News, the South Shore Drive has been something of a local attraction for years. DeVos and her husband, former Amway CEO Dick DeVos, purchased the estate from her father-in-law Richard in 2007 for $4.5 million. HURRICANE IRMA SLAMS INTO PRESIDENT TRUMP'S $17-MILLION CARIBBEAN VACATION HOME Citing city records, Grand Rapid News noted the couple then renovated what had already been a grand home into a massive stone-and-shingle mansion. It now has eight bedrooms, five full bathrooms, three garages and a large infinity pool. \u201cFor months, cars have slowed along South Shore Drive as gawkers have followed the construction of the DeVos home, the biggest house in Holland, if not Ottawa County,\u201d the paper reported. \u201cTheir three-story vacation home sets a new standard for size and grandeur among the other million-dollar-plus mansions that line Lake Macatawa, a popular spot with access to Lake Michigan.\u201d THE OBAMAS MAY INVEST IN PROPERTY ON MARTHA'S VINEYARD \u201cWe are very excited with it,\u201d DeVos told the paper of her new summer residence. With renovation on the desirably located property, real estate broker Andrea Crossman said the high-end lakefront home looks to be easily worth $10 million. BILL AND HILLARY CLINTON'S OLD SUMMER GETAWAY SELLS FOR $29 MILLION To the delight of gawkers both local and virtual, the Secretary of Education\u2019s real estate dream didn\u2019t come true exactly as planned. Grand Rapids News reported that Holland vetoed zoning requests to build a 10-foot-high stone fence around the perimeter of the property. All the better for ogling, indeed!

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., made a surprise promise regarding her potential cabinet on Monday, in the midst of a\u00a0tirade against Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. Warren blasted DeVos for her history of being in favor of for-profit colleges and lack of teaching experience. In contrast, Warren guaranteed that, if she wins in 2020, she will only consider hiring someone with public school teaching experience. ELIZABETH WARREN DESCRIBED AS 'DIEHARD CONSERVATIVE' IN SCHOOL \"She doesn't really believe in public education,\" Warren said about DeVos in a video message posted in a Twitter thread targeting DeVos. \"So here's what I promise: in a Warren administration, we'll have a Secretary of Education who is committed to public education. In fact, I'll double down on that. I will only appoint for Secretary of Education\u00a0someone who has\u00a0been a public school teacher.\" Warren's remarks included a number of angry\u00a0statements about DeVos, calling her \"a terrible Secretary of Education\" and \"a symptom of a badly broken system.\" Under the current system, she said, \"America's teachers are being crushed\" by low budgets and salaries, as well as their own student debt.\u00a0She said hiring someone with public school experience would be part of a necessary \"big structural change.\" JOHN STOSSEL: WHAT HATERS DON'T GET ABOUT BETSY DEVOS The Democratic senator added,\u00a0\"we need to make it easier to join a union,\" saying that would give them\u00a0negotiating power that would be \"good for making sure we put the resources we need directly into our schools.\"",

The 163-foot Seaquest yacht had been moored at the Huron Boat Basin when the captain alerted authorities early Sunday morning it had been untied and set adrift,\u00a0according to a police report provided to Fox News. According to the Toledo Blade, which first reported\u00a0on the incident, the yacht had \"several large scratches and scrapes\" from hitting a dock\u00a0\u2013 resulting in what the captain estimated to be between $5,000 to $10,000 in damage. The investigation is ongoing, Huron Police Chief Bob Lippert told Fox News on Thursday morning. DeVos was in Ohio earlier this month to tour a career center and a correctional treatment program. One of the more controversial figures in the Trump administration, she assumed office as secretary of the Education Department in February 2017. PROTESTERS BLOCK DEVOS FROM ENTERING DC SCHOOL She\u2019s a proponent of school choice and charter schools \u2013 which has resulted in large protests when she addresses college students. Her decision to rescind an Obama-era guidance instructing how college campuses investigate allegations of campus sexual assault was also met with indignation. DeVos and her husband are known for their philanthropic work \u2013 especially when it comes to education \u2013 in their home state of Michigan. SEN. MARK WARNER\u2019S OFFICE VANDALIZED; SUSPECT ARRESTED A spokeswoman previously announced that DeVos plans to donate her nearly $200,000 salary to charities that focus on special needs and education. She also travels on her own private plane, but foots the bill, The Associated Press reported. The Seaquest is one of 10 vessels owned by the DeVos family.\u00a0According to MarineTraffic.com, the yacht was back in Harbor Springs, Michigan, Thursday morning.

            "content": " The Department of Education said it will cancel $150 million of student loan debt, impacting about 15,000 people whose schools closed. The Obama-era borrower defense relief program \u2013 which essentially ground to a halt under Education Secretary Betsy Devos \u2013 provided a path for people to seek forgiveness for federal student loans if a shuttered school violated specific laws or misled students. DeVos was highly critical of the program, reportedly calling it a \u201cfree money\u201d giveaway, and sought to change and delay the program. However, she was sued, and a federal judge ruled in September the program needed to \u201cgo into effect.\u201d Those eligible for loan forgiveness must have been enrolled at the school when it closed and not enrolled at another Title-IV school within three years of the previous school\u2019s closing, according to the Education Department. PLUS loans \u2013 which parents took out on behalf of children \u2013 could also be eligible for discharge. EDUCATION DEPARTMENT UNVEILS NEW TITLE IX GUIDANCE FOR CAMPUS SEXUAL ASSAULT: HERE\u2019S WHAT WILL CHANGE So far, about 15,000 people have been flagged by the Education Department as eligible. About $80 million of the $150 million debt is attributed to the now-defunct Corinthian schools. Borrowers will begin to be notified of student loan discharges by email on Friday, the department said. BETSY DEVOS CONSIDERING ALLOWING STATES TO USE FEDERAL FUNDS TO BUY GUNS: REPORT \u201cThis is a good first step, but it\u2019s not good enough,\u201d said Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the Education Committee. She called on DeVos to \u201cabandon her attempts to rewrite the borrower defense rule to let for-profit colleges off the hook and instead fully implement the current rule and provide relief to more than 100,000 borrowers who were cheated out of their education and savings.\u201d Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander, the Education Committee chair, previously argued the \u201cObama administration went too far in rewriting this provision by setting overly broad and vague standards and as a result, put taxpayers on the hook for too many loans.\u201d",

            "content": "COLUMBIA, S.C. \u2013 U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos is visiting a South Carolina area known as the \"Corridor of Shame\" due to its underperforming schools, making a trip to an area that's been held out as an example of the need to make reforms to the state's schools. DeVos plans to travel on Thursday to Florence County, one of several dozen districts along Interstate 95 once bestowed the nickname \"Corridor of Shame\" because of their substandard schools. Along with U.S. Deputy Secretary of Education Mitchell Zais \u2014 who headed up South Carolina's schools from 2011 to 2015 \u2014 Lt. Gov. Pamela Evette and state Superintendent of Education Molly Spearman, DeVos will visit Timmonsville Educational Center, as well as the Southeastern Institute of Manufacturing & Technology, which focuses on matching up workforce training programs with local industry needs. They'll also be joined by U.S. Rep. Tom Rice, whose office told The Associated Press on Wednesday he's discussed the importance of technical schools with DeVos in the past and has been working to get her to the district to get a firsthand look at improvements. The visit comes amid ongoing debate on how to improve South Carolina's education system, with legislative leaders and the governor saying they're placing a priority on the issue this session. Gov. Henry McMaster, who has asked officials for a study of the decades-old formula that determines how districts are funded, pledged in his State of the State address last month that \"the words 'Corridor of Shame' will be a distant memory.\" The area was part of a decades-old lawsuit over education funding. In 2014, the state Supreme Court ruled that rural schools had violated the state Constitution by failing to provide each student with quality education. Last year, the high court dismissed the suit, voting 3-2 to close a legal case that examined whether the Legislature provides enough money and support for poor and rural schools, ruling that officials had resolved the overarching dispute. In a 1999 ruling, justices coined the phrase \"minimally adequate education,\" immediately bothering many people who thought South Carolina should aspire to being more than adequate at something as important as public education. The legal case led to the 2005 \"Corridor of Shame\" documentary, which depicted decrepit conditions. Politicians and public officials have made pilgrimages to the area, including then-Sen. Barack Obama, who in 2007 toured a school, a portion of which was still in use and dated to the late 19th century. Upon taking office in 2017, McMaster launched a tour of some of the schools seen in the film to push for his ideas on education reform. ___ Meg Kinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP",

            "content": "Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u00a0raked in $24.6\u00a0million during the July-September fundraising quarter, blowing past former Vice President Joe Biden and coming close to Sen. Bernie Sanders' field-leading haul. The figure affirms the momentum Warren has appeared to be gaining in recent weeks and months, as polls show her now battling Biden \u2013\u00a0once the unrivaled front-runner \u2013\u00a0for the primary lead. While Sanders remains in third position in many polls, his fundraising is unmatched, totaling\u00a0$25.3 million in the third quarter. BIDEN RAISES $15.2 MILLION IN THIRD QUARTER, DOWN $6 MILLION FROM APRIL-JUNE HAUL But Warren's campaign cash number comes close \u2014\u00a0and is far ahead of the $15.2 million raised by\u00a0Biden\u00a0in the last quarter. Warren and Biden are essentially tied for the lead position in most recent national and early-voting-state Democratic nomination polls. The Massachusetts senator, who\u2019s produced one progressive policy proposal after another,\u00a0announced her fundraising figures on Twitter, saying, \u201cI\u2019m grateful down to my toes for every grassroots supporter who chipped in.\u201d \u201cTogether, we\u2019re building a movement that\u2019s going to put power back in the hands of the people,\u201d she pledged. THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN Warren\u2019s third-quarter haul is up nearly $6 million from what she raised during the April-June quarter. Her campaign announced that they received 943,000 contributions from more than a half-million individual donors, with 300,000 of those donors giving for the first time. And they reported that the average contribution to Warren was $26. South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg reported raising $19.1 million this quarter. Sen. Kamala Harris of California reported bringing in $11.6 million in the third quarter, with tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang hauling in $10 million, triple what he raised in the second quarter. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey announced he raised over $6 million. Best-selling spiritual author Marianne Williamson said she raised over $3 million and Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado reported raising $2.1 million. President Trump\u2019s reelection team, meanwhile, blew past all of them. The campaign\u00a0announced that it\u00a0and the Republican National Committee combined had brought in a massive $125 million in the third quarter. Asked Thursday during a campaign stop in California how she could compete with Trump's massive war chest if\u00a0she reaches the general election, Warren touted her \"grassroots movement\" and highlighted \"that's going to be our comparative advantage to win in November 2020.\" Tuesday was the first day campaigns could announce their third-quarter numbers, but they have until Oct. 15 to file their fundraising reports with the Federal Election Commission. Campaign cash is a crucial barometer of a candidate\u2019s appeal and popularity and of his or her campaign\u2019s strength. Fundraising dollars can be used by the candidates to pay for campaign staff and grassroots outreach efforts, travel\u00a0and ads. ",

            "content": " Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren\u00a0Wednesday unveiled a plan to invest $85 billion in publicly owned and operated broadband networks to expand internet access in the U.S., with a particular focus on underserved rural areas. The senator from Massachusetts, who has rolled out a series of policy proposals on everything from Wall Street to\u00a0climate change, immigration and the economy, announced the plan just before a road trip to Iowa, which will vote in the Democratic nominating contest on February 3. The plan envisions an $85 billion federal grant to create \"fiber infrastructure necessary to bring high-speed broadband to unserved areas, underserved areas, or areas with minimal competition,\" according to a Medium post detailing the proposal. In many areas of rural America, entire communities don't have the broadband access that is\u00a0taken for granted in most big U.S. cities and metropolitan areas. DEMOCRATS BLAST GOOGLE AS 'ANTI-WORKER,' DEMAND ITS CONTRACTORS BECOME PERMANENT WORKERS FACEBOOK FAILS TO STOP FLOOD OF FAKE REVIEWS, INVESTIGATIVE BODY SAYS The intiative would also restore the Obama administration's rules on net neutrality, which refers to regulations that make certain internet-service providers treat all online traffic equally. Activists have slammed the Trump administration for essentially overturning the regulations. Warren would also set aside $5 billion specifically for federal grants to expand broadband access on Native American lands. These grants, like most of Warren's major proposals, would be funded by an \"ultra-millionaire tax,\" a 2 percent levy on wealth greater than $50 million and an additional 1 percent tax on wealth above $1 billion.

Elizabeth Warren\u2019s surge in the Democratic primary with progressive voters \u2013 is seeking to cut into the support of his rival by dismissing her as a \u201ccapitalist.\u201d \u201cThere are differences between Elizabeth and myself,\u201d Sanders said during an interview Sunday on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cElizabeth I think, as you know, has said that she is a capitalist through her bones. I\u2019m not.\u201d BILLIONAIRES COULD FACE UP TO 97.5 PERCENT TAX RATES UNDER SANDERS\u2019 PLAN: ECONOMISTS The comments come\u00a0amid a rise in socialism in the Democratic Party, as candidates become more willing to openly embrace socialism over capitalism.\u00a0It also follows polling showing that Democrats now view socialism more positively than they do capitalism. Last year,\u00a0when asked if she was a capitalist, Warren\u00a0reportedly said, \"I am a capitalist to my bones.\" Sanders explained he is not a capitalist\u00a0because he\u00a0\"will not tolerate for one second the kind of greed and corruption and income and wealth inequality and so much suffering that is going on in this country today, which is unnecessary.\u201d A Gallup poll this year\u00a0found that 43 percent of Americans think socialism would be a good thing for the United States, while 51 percent say it would be a bad thing. Gallup noted that in 1942, a Roper/Fortune survey that found 40 percent of Americans described socialism as a bad thing while only 25 percent called it a good thing. The polling is fresh evidence that attitudes toward socialism are changing, amid the popularity in the Democratic Party of Democratic socialists like Sanders and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who pushes policies like \u201cMedicare-for-all\u201d and the Green New Deal. Meanwhile, two economists at the\u00a0University of California, Berkeley, claim that billionaires could face a 97.5 percent average effective tax rate under\u00a0Sanders'\u00a0plan, which would easily thump other Democrats running for president in 2020. Emmanuel Saez, one of the professors, told\u00a0Bloomberg\u00a0that \u201cwith the wealth tax, you get directly at the stock instead of hitting the flow of income, making it a\u00a0much more powerful de-concentration tool than income taxes.\"\u00a0The report pointed out that Sanders has said that the number of billionaires in the U.S. would be cut in half within 15 years under the plan. The plan unveiled by Sanders seeks a 1 percent\u00a0levy on households worth more than $32 million and proposes tax rates that would increase for wealthier people, up to 8 percent\u00a0for fortunes in excess of $10 billion. Sanders vowed to go further than\u00a0Warren and generate more than $4 trillion over the next decade, substantially reducing billionaires\u2019 fortunes. Billionaires would face a 62 percent average effective tax rate under Warren. Sanders\u2019 plan goes further because it starts on fortunes worth less, kicking in at $32 million. Warren also proposes increasing the wealth tax up to 3 percent\u00a0on any net worth of more than $1 billion, while Sanders\u2019 tax rates don\u2019t top out until 8 percent\u00a0for the richest households.

U.K. bookmaker Ladbrokes allows people to put money on the race, and according to Matthew Shaddick, head of their political betting division, the former first lady and secretary of state is currently leading the pack when it comes to the number of bets people have made. MARIAH CAREY CALLS HILLARY CLINTON 'PRESIDENT' IN PHOTO OP \u201cWe\u2019re baffled, to be honest,\u201d Shaddick told Newsweek. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken more bets on her to be the Democratic candidate than any of the other runners.\u201d The site currently has Clinton\u2019s betting odds at 20 to 1, placing her alone in seventh place as far as best odds. That is ahead of most of the people actually running, including Sens. Cory Booker, D-N.J., and Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, and former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke. Another former first lady who is not running for president is also getting better odds than some of the people in the race. Michelle Obama currently has odds of 100 to 1, ahead of candidates including New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, author Marianne Williamson, and billionaire Tom Steyer, who are each at 200 to 1. EX-CLINTON AIDE SAYS SHE WOULD 'ANKLE DIVE' TO STOP HILLARY FROM RUNNING AGAIN Ladbrokes currently has Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., as the front-runner with 6 to 4 odds, with former Vice President Joe Biden at 5 to 2, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., at 5 to 1, and entrepreneur Andrew Yang, Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and South Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg at 16 to 1. Of all of them, it\u2019s the 2016 nominee Clinton that Shaddick says would hurt his site the most. \u201cShe would be by far the worst result for us\u2014i.e., the one we would lose most money on,\" Shaddick said. \"Hence, her odds have come in from 50/1 to 20/1.\u201d CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Nevertheless, he does not understand why people are betting on her. \u201cI've seen some speculation about what might happen if Biden had to drop out for some reason\u2014perhaps that would leave a space for her to occupy in the field?\" Shaddick said. \"Doesn't really convince me as a good reason, though.\"",

During a discussion on healthcare, Trump brought up his failed attempt to repeal\u00a0and replace the Affordable Care Act, also referred to Obamacare, before renewing his ongoing criticism of the late former Senator. \"The fake news doesn't want to say it. We will always protect pre-existing conditions, very important. By the way, we got rid of the individual mandate, the worst part of Obamacare and we almost had it repealed and replaced but we had one man that after campaigning for eight years, he decided to go thumbs down at two o'clock in the morning,\" Trump said. DONALD TRUMP'S FEUD WITH MCCAIN FAMILY ESCALATES: 'I WAS NEVER A FAN' \"That's all right, but we'll end up, we'll end up with even better because we have plans that are even better than that.\" The comment was seemingly in reference to former Sen. McCain, R-Ariz., who famously voted against the repeal in 2017 giving it a thumbs down. This isn't the first time Trump has been critical of McCain after his death. During a speech in Ohio this past March Trump tore into McCain\u2019s legacy and in an unusual remark, took credit for the late senator\u2019s state funeral in Washington last year. \u201cI endorsed him at his request, gave him the kind of funeral he wanted, which as president of the United States I had to approve,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI don\u2019t care, but I didn\u2019t get a thank you.\u201d \u201cI never liked him much,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI really probably never will.\u201d TRUMP INVITES SUPPORTER WEARING WALL SUIT TO PENNSYLVANIA RALLY STAGE Trump\u2019s feud with McCain dates back to well before he was elected president. In 2015, after McCain had said Trump's platform had \"fired up the crazies,\" Trump mocked McCain's imprisonment in the Vietnam War, saying: \"I like people that weren't captured.\" The two continued to be at odds until McCain\u2019s death from brain cancer last August.

John McCain, a war hero who survived five years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, served three decades in Congress and went on to become the Republican Party\u2019s nominee for president in 2008, died Saturday.\u00a0He was 81 years old. In his last hours, the Arizona Republican turned down further medical treatment, his family announced in a statement. McCain was diagnosed with brain cancer in July 2017. Doctors discovered the tumor during a medical procedure to remove a blood clot from above his left eye. He remained upbeat after the diagnosis, flying back to Washington days after surgery with a large scar visible above his eye to partake in the Senate\u2019s health care debate. \u201cI greatly appreciate the outpouring of support - unfortunately for my sparring partners in Congress, I'll be back soon, so stand-by!\u201d McCain tweeted on July 20 after his diagnosis. On Friday, his family issued a statement saying,\u201cLast summer, Senator John McCain shared with Americans the news our family already knew: he had been diagnosed with an aggressive glioblastoma, and the prognosis was serious. In the year since, John has surpassed expectations for his survival. But the progress of disease and the inexorable advance of age render their verdict.\" They added, \"With his usual strength of will, he has now chosen to discontinue medical treatment.\" McCain's wife, Cindy, tweeted that her \"heart is broken\" following her husband's death. \"I am so lucky to have lived the adventure of loving this incredible man for 38 years,\" she said. \"He passed the way he lived, on his own terms, surrounded by the people he loved, in the the place he loved best.\" The senator's daughter, Meghan, posted a heartfelt note online, in which she said the \"task of [her] lifetime is to live up to [McCain's] example, his expectations, and his love.\" \"My father is gone, and I miss him as only an adoring daughter can,\" she wrote. \"He was a great fire who burned bright, and we lives in his light and warmth for so very long. We know that his flame lives on, in each of us. The days and years to come will not be the same without my dad \u2014 but they will be good days, filled with life and love, because of the example he lived for us.\" McCain was born in 1936 in the Panama Canal Zone, where his father was stationed in the Navy. After graduating from the Naval Academy in 1958, McCain went to Vietnam. In 1967, his A4 Skyhawk was hit by a surface-to-air missile over Hanoi. McCain was captured by the North Vietnamese, who tortured and beat him for more than five years. He was in solitary confinement for several of those years. \u201cMy room was fairly decent-sized - I\u2019d say about 10 by 10,\u201d McCain would later write. \u201cThe door was solid. There were no windows. The only ventilation came from two small holes at the top in the ceiling, about 6 inches by 4 inches. The roof was tin, and it got hot as hell in there.\u201d His captors offered him early release after learning his father was a notable naval officer. But McCain refused to leave before the other prisoners. He was released in 1973. McCain\u2019s injuries from his imprisonment were visible the rest of his life, most noticeably the restricted movement of his arms. McCain got a taste of politics in 1976, when he served as the Navy\u2019s liaison to the Senate. In 1982, McCain was elected to the House of Representatives. Only a few years later, in 1986, he won the race to replace Arizona\u2019s conservative Sen. Barry Goldwater. He was implicated in what became known as the Keating Five Scandal in 1989, accused with several other lawmakers of helping the owner of the Lincoln Savings and Loan, who had donated to his campaign. McCain ran twice for president. In 2000, he ran for the Republican nomination for president, winning New Hampshire\u2019s primary but losing the nomination to George W. Bush. In 2008, he defeated a host of Republican candidates to win the GOP nomination for president. He was responsible for introducing then-Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin to a national audience by tapping her as his running mate. The McCain-Palin ticket went on to lose the general election to Barack Obama, who became the country\u2019s first black president. For years, McCain declined to call his choice of Palin a mistake. But in his upcoming book, \u201cThe Restless Wave,\u201d McCain reportedly writes that he regrets not choosing his friend, then-U.S. Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., as his running mate,\u00a0calling it \u201canother mistake that I made.\u201d\u00a0Lieberman, the 2000 Democratic nominee for vice president, was an independent who caucused with Democrats. After the 2008 loss, McCain returned to the Senate, embracing his role as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. During his last years in politics, he had a complicated relationship with President Trump, who infamously attacked McCain during the GOP primary. In May, the McCain family was offended when it was reported that Trump aide Kelly Sadler dismissed McCain's opposition to the president\u2019s choice for CIA director by quipping during a private meeting, \"It doesn't matter, he's dying anyway.\" According to the New York Times, McCain has made clear to the White House he doesn\u2019t want Trump to attend his funeral, and would instead prefer Vice President Mike Pence at a service. McCain is survived by his wife Cindy, seven children and five grandchildren.",

McCain had denied being the source for BuzzFeed after it published the dossier, but acknowledged giving it to the FBI.

            "content": " Sarah Palin\u2019s defamation lawsuit against The New York Times over an editorial that linked her political action committee to the shooting of former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., has been revived, after a lower court judge previously had dismissed it. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruled on Tuesday that Judge Jed Rakoff of the Southern District of New York strayed from procedural norms before tossing out Palin\u2019s libel complaint in August 2017. Rakoff held a hearing to learn more facts about the case before ruling on the Times\u2019 motion to dismiss, when such decisions typically rely solely on what is alleged in court documents. PALIN SUIT AGAINST NY TIMES SPOTLIGHTS A FLOOD OF MEDIA MISTAKES \u201cWe find that the district court erred in relying on facts outside the pleadings to dismiss the complaint,\u201d Second Circuit Judge John M. Walker Jr. wrote. The former vice presidential candidate\u00a0sued the Times for libel after a June 2017\u00a0editorial about the shooting of GOP Rep. Steve Scalise and others\u00a0mentioned a map put out years earlier by SarahPAC that had crosshairs over different Democratic congressional districts. While the map had been used in reference to ObamaCare, the editorial connected it to Jared Loughner\u2019s 2011 shooting of Giffords, whose district was among the ones identified in the map. The editorial said that the SarahPAC map had Giffords and other Democrats under crosshairs (though the targets were over their districts). In discussing the Scalise shooting, the Times said, \u201cThough there\u2019s no sign of incitement as direct as in the Giffords attack, liberals should of course hold themselves to the same standard of decency that they ask of the right.\u201d \u201cNo evidence ever emerged to establish that link; in fact, the criminal investigation of Loughner indicated that his animosity toward Representative Giffords had arisen before SarahPAC published the map,\u201d Walker noted Tuesday. The Times published a correction after receiving backlash for the editorial, noting that there was no link between the map and the shooting. Rakoff had originally held the hearing in question in order\u00a0to learn whether there was enough support for Palin\u2019s claim that the editorial was published with \u201cactual malice\u201d \u2013 knowledge that a statement is false or reckless disregard for whether it is true \u2013 which is the standard for public figures to bring defamation claims. GREGG JARRETT: SARAH PALIN VS. THE NEW YORK TIMES -- FIVE REASONS WHY EX-GOVERNOR MIGHT JUST WIN HER CASE Rakoff brought in the author of the editorial, James Bennet, who answered questions about his knowledge that the Times had previously published articles that said there was no link between the map and the shooting. Bennet said he was unaware at the time he wrote the editorial. The information Rakoff learned from the hearing was enough for him to dismiss Palin\u2019s claim with prejudice, meaning she was not permitted to file an amended complaint. The Second Circuit ruled that this was improper as it ran \u201cheadlong\u201d into the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP A Times\u00a0spokesperson told The Associated Press that the newspaper is disappointed and will vigorously fight the lawsuit.

Sarah Palin, like President Trump, has been left off the list of invitees to the funeral of the late U.S. Sen. John McCain, according to multiple reports. \u201cMy guess is, it came from Cindy,\u201d a source close to the McCain family told People magazine, referring to the late senator\u2019s widow. \u201cShe is very protective of John\u2019s memory and legacy. She\u2019s also a grieving widow. I think she wants to get through this as best she can.\u201d The message was sent through an intermediary, not directly from the McCain family, according to the report. An NBC reporter tweeted that a Palin \"family source\" said,\u00a0\u201cOut of respect to Senator McCain and his family we have nothing to add at this point. The Palin family will always cherish their friendship with the McCains and hold those memories dear.\u201d Palin did not immediately respond to a Fox News email sent early Thursday. A decade ago, it was McCain\u2019s selection of Palin to be his vice president that catapulted Palin to the national political spotlight from relative obscurity in Alaska. But their relationship quickly grew strained, amid accusations that Palin was often unprepared for media interviews, or had \u201cgone rogue\u201d by ignoring the advice of McCain campaign handlers. Some critics charged that Palin was more interested in advancing her own career \u2013 and popularity among conservative voters -- than assuring the success of the McCain-Palin ticket, led by the more moderate McCain. In May, McCain published a book titled \u201cThe Restless Wave,\u201d in which he wrote that he regretted choosing Palin as his running mate instead of his close friend, former U.S. Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut. McCain and Palin ultimately lost the White House in 2008 to Barack Obama and Joe Biden. Ironically, Biden is scheduled to speak Thursday at a McCain memorial service in the senator\u2019s home state of Arizona, while Obama has been invited to deliver a eulogy Saturday at a McCain memorial service in Washington, D.C. Following McCain\u2019s death from brain cancer last Saturday at age 81, Palin issued a pair of Twitter messages. \u201cToday we lost an American original,\u201d she wrote. \u201cSen. John McCain was a maverick and a fighter, never afraid to stand for his beliefs. John never took the easy path in life - and through sacrifice and suffering he inspired others to serve something greater than self.\u201d Later, she wrote: \u201cJohn McCain was my friend. I will remember the good times. My family and I send prayers for Cindy and the McCain family.\u201d",

            "author": "Daniel Marans",
            "content": " PHILADELPHIA \u2015 Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), a co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, offered some qualified criticism Friday of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s disparaging comments about some of Jayapal\u2019s progressive colleagues, even as she defended Pelosi\u2019s overall leadership style. \u201cI don\u2019t think those comments were helpful to a broader picture of how we build progressive power in the House and what it looks like relative to overall Democratic power,\u201d she said during a panel discussion at the liberal Netroots Nations conference in Philadelphia. Jayapal was being asked to respond to a public spat between Pelosi and four newly elected progressive congresswomen nicknamed \u201cthe Squad\u201d: Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts. In an interview with New York Times op-ed columnist Maureen Dowd last Saturday, Pelosi made light of the Squad\u2019s influence. \u201cAll these people have their public whatever and their Twitter world,\u201d she said of the Squad. \u201cBut they didn\u2019t have any following. They\u2019re four people and that\u2019s how many votes they got.\u201d The four congresswomen were the only Democrats to vote against a House emergency border funding bill, which contained new conditions designed to ensure humane treatment of the asylum seekers surging across the border. The Squad thought that the conditions on how the money would be spent were insufficient and wanted to block additional funding for\u00a0Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u00a0entirely. In the end, the GOP-controlled Senate passed a bipartisan border funding bill by a margin of 84 to 8\u00a0that contained far fewer humanitarian regulations aimed at improving conditions in the detention facilities holding the asylum seekers. When the bill came back to the House, moderate Democrats forced a vote on the Senate version without amending it to include the more-liberal House provisions, defying Pelosi\u2019s wishes and saddling her with a rare legislative loss. That Pelosi subsequently lashed out at the Squad for the first dissenting vote, rather than the centrists who foiled her plans when the Senate bill came back to the House, irked many progressive activists. It is also only the latest of many times when Pelosi has spoken dismissively about Ocasio-Cortez or her colleagues. In response, Ocasio-Cortez has gone so far as suggesting the four women are targets because they are not white. In an interview with The Washington Post, she criticized Pelosi for persistent \u201csingling out of newly elected women of color,\u201d which she called \u201coutright disrespectful.\u201d Jayapal, whose agenda largely depends on Pelosi\u2019s cooperation, couched her modest criticism of the remarks with a far lengthier defense of the governing philosophy she believes Pelosi intended to articulate. \u201cI believe that it all comes down to votes,\u201d Jayapal said. \u201cWhether you\u2019re on the outside or the inside, you\u2019ve got to be able to leverage the votes.\u201d Thus, according to Jayapal, Pelosi, an expert vote counter, was merely pointing out that because the Squad does not command the support of a larger bloc of votes, they lack the power to dictate House Democrats\u2019 agenda. \u201cI think what Pelosi was talking about is if you only have four votes in the House that you can\u2019t get what you want done,\u201d she said. Jayapal, who is an immigrant from India, added a subtle repudiation of Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s comments questioning Pelosi\u2019s racial sensitivity. \u201cI don\u2019t typically find Pelosi to be someone who disrespects members,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt disrespected as a woman of color by Nancy Pelosi.\u201d Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) spoke alongside Jayapal on the panel at Netroots Nation, which was about how to enact ambitious progressive legislation. Jayapal arrived late from Washington because she had to vote on a defense spending bill, so initially Merkley had the panel to himself. He blamed House Democratic leaders for the passage of the unamended Senate bill, which he had voted against in the Senate. He argued that many Senate Democrats voted for the border security legislation on the assumption that House Democrats would pass their more ambitious version again and force the two legislative chambers into a conference committee that would produce a compromise. As a result of the House\u2019s failure to force the bills into a conference committee, Merkley said, \u201cWe lost all the leverage that the progressives like Rep. Jayapal had worked so hard to get. It just went down the tube.\u201d \u201cThe House has to carry its weight to restore the values of America,\u201d he added. \u201cIt failed on this occasion.\u201d When Jayapal arrived, she blamed Senate Democrats for passing the more conservative legislation by such a wide margin. That created a situation, she said, in which moderate House Democrats wondered why they could not just vote for such a consensus-driven bill. \u201cWe cannot have the Senate passing these big bipartisan votes because it affects what happens in the House,\u201d she said.",

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) accused Amazon of paying its employees \u201cstarvation wages\u201d while its CEO Jeff Bezos enjoys the billionaire life, the tech giant pushed back, calling the congresswoman\u2019s remarks \u201cabsurd\u201d and \u201cjust wrong.\u201d Speaking with ABC News\u2019 \u201cThis Week\u201d on Sunday, Ocasio-Cortez suggested Amazon was not fairly compensating its employees while Bezos, who has a net worth of roughly $118 billion, continues to fatten his coffers. The freshman congresswoman clarified that she doesn\u2019t care if Bezos is a billionaire as long as Amazon pays its workers a \u201cliving wage\u201d and provides them with adequate benefits. But, she said, if Bezos\u2019 wealth is \u201cpredicated on paying people starvation wages and stripping them of the ability to access health care,\u201d then that\u2019s a major problem. Amazon hit back on Monday, saying in a tweet that it was \u201ca leader on pay at $15 min wage + full benefits from day one.\u201d Jay Carney, Amazon\u2019s senior vice president of global corporate affairs, accused Ocasio-Cortez of \u201cmaking stuff up about Amazon.\u201d The company told CNN in a statement that the congresswoman\u2019s allegations were \u201cabsurd.\u201d But Ocasio-Cortez, a frequent critic of Amazon, had a rebuttal of her own. She took issue with the company\u2019s use of the term \u201cfrom day one,\u201d sharing a link on Twitter on Monday night to a Daily Beast story from September\u00a0about Amazon employees living \u201cpaycheck to paycheck\u201d and some relying on public assistance programs to make ends meet. \u201cIf a person is working 40h/week & is paid so little that they need gov help to make ends meet, it\u2019s not the person that\u2019s a weight on our system \u2015 it\u2019s the company,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said. Amazon raised its minimum wage to $15 per hour last year after facing public pressure to do so.\u00a0The company said at the time that its public policy team would also begin lobbying for an increase in the federal minimum wage. \u201cWe listened to our critics, thought hard about what we wanted to do, and decided we want to lead,\u201d Bezos said in a statement of the wage increase. \u201cWe\u2019re excited about this change and encourage our competitors and other large employers to join us.\u201d",

The Anti-Defamation League demanded afterward that GOP leadership condemn King and remove him from his chairmanship of the House Judiciary Committee. He was finally\u00a0stripped of his positions on the judiciary and the agriculture committees\u00a0earlier this year, after he asked during a New York Times interview what was offensive about white supremacy.

            "content": " Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) confronted the acting secretary of homeland security, Kevin McAleenan, on Thursday amid a report this month that DHS employees belonged to a secret Facebook group that shared violent, racist images among its members, including a photoshopped meme of the congresswomen being assaulted. McAleenan was grilled by the freshman lawmaker during a hearing before the House Oversight Committee about the Trump administration\u2019s policy of separating migrant children from their parents. Ocasio-Cortez used her time to point to a July ProPublica report that uncovered the secret group, where around 9,500 members, some who belonged to Border Patrol, joked about migrant deaths and posted the violent memes. During her questioning, she asked if the acting secretary had seen photoshopped images of herself shared in the group, and asked if any members of Border Patrol affiliated with them were still responsible for working with migrant women and children. \u201cDid you see the images of officers circulating photoshopped images of my violent rape?\u201d the lawmaker asked. \u201cDo you think that the policy of child separation could have contributed to a dehumanizing culture within CBP that contributes and kind of spills over into other areas of conduct?\u201d McAleenan replied that he had, but demurred about any potential Border Patrol officers that had been reprimanded to for their involvement, saying simply that some had been placed on \u201cadministrative duties.\u201d An investigation by Customs and Border Patrol said this week it determined at least 62 current border agents were in the offensive group. \u201cWe do not have a dehumanizing culture at CBP. This is an agency that rescues 4,000 people a year. It\u2019s absolutely committed to the well-being of everyone that they interact with,\u201d McAleenan replied. He went on to note that the posts were \u201cunacceptable\u201d and said he had ordered an ongoing investigation \u201cwithin minutes\u201d of learning about the group. Ocasio-Cortez stood by her line of questioning on Twitter later that day, noting that in her estimation, Trump administration policies were \u201cgravely dehumanizing\u201d and had stripped \u201call involved of human decency.\u201d President Donald Trump and his immigration officials have faced a nonstop whirlwind of criticism over their hard-line border policies, including the short-lived but devastating \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy that saw thousands of migrant children separated from their parents. Recently, border officials have been operating under the White House\u2019s \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d policy, which has seen thousands of asylum-seekers sent back across the southern border while they wait for their cases to be heard. Lawmakers also fired blistering criticism at McAleenan amid ongoing reports of filthy, overcrowded conditions at migrant detention centers along the southern border. \u201cWhat does that mean when a child is sitting in their own feces? Can\u2019t take a shower?\u201d Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the chairman of the oversight committee, said during the hearing. \u201cWhat\u2019s that about? None of us would have our children in that position. They are human beings.\u201d",

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) wasn\u2019t having it. Video games \u201cdehumanize individuals to have a game of shooting individuals and others,\u201d McCarthy said on Fox News\u00a0shortly after mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, left a combined total of at least 31 people dead. \u201cWhen you look at these photos of how [the El Paso shooting] took place, you can see the actions within video games and others,\u201d McCarthy said. But Ocasio-Cortez said the real problem is white supremacy, and argued that it\u2019s an issue Republicans won\u2019t address because that would mean taking on part of their base: The suspected gunman in El Paso is a white man who reportedly shared a white supremacist manifesto online before the shooting. The hate-filled document attacked immigrants, claiming there is a \u201cHispanic invasion of Texas.\u201d President Donald Trump has also called immigration an \u201cinvasion,\u201d including in his campaign ads on Facebook. Ocasio-Cortez shared a tweet showing some of those ads:",

            "content": " A group of young men in \u201cTeam Mitch\u201d campaign shirts supporting Senate Majority Leader\u00a0Mitch McConnell at an annual political picnic in Kentucky were captured in a photo smiling as one of them pretended to strangle a cardboard cutout of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.). Social media accounts of some of the men identified by Twitter users were taken down \u2014 or shut down by Twitter for inappropriate postings \u2014 by Monday. But at least one Instagram account of a local Republican backer who also attended the picnic had it up late in the day. It was also later removed. Ocasio-Cortez slammed back at the Senate majority leader after seeing the post, asking if McConnell is \u201cpaying for young men to practice groping & choking members of Congress w/ your payroll, or is this just the standard culture of #TeamMitch?\u201d McConnell campaign spokesman Kevin Golden told HuffPost in an email that Team Mitch \u201cin no way condones any aggressive, suggestive, or demeaning act toward life-sized cardboard cutouts of any gender.\u201d He said the men are \u201cnot campaign staff; they\u2019re high schoolers, and it\u2019s incredible that the national media has sought to once again paint a target on their backs rather than report real, and significant news in our country.\u201d Some of the same men also appeared in a photo on the official \u201cTeam Mitch\u201d Instagram account for the Fancy Farm picnic, holding aloft cutout faces of Supreme Court Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch. The photo was the second controversial image to come out of Team Mitch\u2019s participation at the Fancy Farm picnic. Another photo showed cardboard gravestones,\u00a0including one with the name of the Kentucky senator\u2019s Democratic challenger in 2020, Amy McGrath. The campaign tweeted the image under the headline: \u201cThe Grim Reaper of Socialism.\u201d McConnell\u2019s campaign manager, Kevin Golden, insisted the gravestones were a homage to a cartoon in the Louisville Courrier-Journal that featured gravestones, also including one of McGrath. Both images linking killing and death to political targets come at a particularly fraught time, after a weekend that saw two mass murders \u2014 including the apparently hate-fueled attack in El Paso, Texas, that has left 22 people dead. Critics are linking the violence to political leaders\u2019 hate speech and racist attacks. Ocasio-Cortez and three other freshman congresswomen of color \u2014 along with African American Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) \u2014 have been viciously attacked in recent weeks in public statements by President Donald Trump.",

            "content": " QUEENS, N.Y. \u2015 Less than a week after President Donald Trump told her to \u201cgo back\u201d to her country, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) returned to her home \u2014 New York City. She held a town hall in Corona, Queens \u2014 her first since the end of June. The topic of the forum, held in the auditorium of a public school, was immigration \u2015 the same issue that had landed her in the crosshairs of both House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Trump. But facing hundreds of her diverse and adoring constituents, some of whom held homemade signs welcoming her, the freshman congresswoman defended her progressive vision of immigration reform against attacks from both Republicans and her fellow Democrats. \u201cWe\u2019re here. They sent me back to Queens \u2015 and I\u2019m happy to be here,\u201d she began with a chuckle, drawing sustained applause and shouts of \u201cwelcome home\u201d from the crowd. Ocasio-Cortez trained her fire first on Trump, arguing that his remarks revealed his racist character. \u201cAll you need to do is hear what the president did this week to know that this is not about immigration at all. Because once you start telling American citizens to quote \u2018go back to their countries,\u2019 this tells you that this president\u2019s policies are not about immigration, it\u2019s about ethnicity and race,\u201d she said. \u201cHis biggest mistake was that he said the quiet part loud.\u201d But without naming names, the New York congresswoman also acknowledged that she has been taking flak for her positions from fellow Democrats. \u201cI\u2019ll keep it real with you all, even within our party it\u2019s a difficult issue. ... One of the reasons I get in trouble is because I talk about immigration too much. It\u2019s because I try to protect our community quote-unquote too much. It\u2019s because I say that there are some things that should not be up to politics and putting kids in cages is one of them,\u201d she said, prompting loud applause. Ocasio-Cortez called for the creation of a commission \u2014 modeled after the storied commission that analyzed the causes of the Sept. 11 attacks \u2014 to look into the causes and impact of the Trump administration\u2019s policy of separating immigrant children from their parents. \u201cThat kind of study is what\u2019s going to be required in order to reunify as many children with their parents as possible,\u201d she said. In her remarks, Ocasio-Cortez also proposed a similar commission to study the damage and aftermath of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico. In a subsequent tweet, she added an appeal for a panel to study reparations for the descendants of slaves. Rarely, if ever, has Ocasio-Cortez felt more pressure from her party leadership than in the past few weeks. At the end of June, Ocasio-Cortez and the three Democratic colleagues \u2015 Reps. Rashida Tlaib (Mich.), Ayanna Pressley (Mass.) and Ilhan Omar (Minn.) \u2015 who are together known as \u201cthe Squad,\u201d were the only House Democrats to vote against a border funding bill backed by Speaker Pelosi and House leadership that sought to provide greater resources for federal authorities to deal with a surge of asylum-seekers at the Southern border. The congresswomen cast their votes as a matter of conscience, arguing that there were inadequate humanitarian strings attached to the new money and that border funding should be conditional on an end to practices like the detention of children. The bill passed easily, despite their opposition. The Republican Senate passed a border funding bill with none of the conditions the House approved. But rather than pass their bill again in the House and force a conference committee to draw up a compromise between the two chambers, moderate Democrats in the House led a revolt against Pelosi that forced the passage of the unamended Senate bill. Rather than publicly chide the moderates, Pelosi targeted the Squad, telling a New York Times columnist on July 6, \u201cThese people have their public whatever and their Twitter world. But they didn\u2019t have any following. They\u2019re four people and that\u2019s how many votes they got.\u201d A war of words ensued between members of the Squad, who felt unfairly singled out, and Democratic leadership and its staffers, who are wary of the progressive primary challenges that propelled Ocasio-Cortez and Pressley to power. The tiff came to a head on July 12 when the House Democratic Caucus\u2019 official Twitter account insulted Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s chief of staff and Pelosi\u2019s deputy chief of staff retweeted it. Ocasio-Cortez defended her vote against the original House vote again on Saturday, even as she avoided reviving the now-dormant feud with Pelosi and her allies. She argued that it lacked the key humanitarian provisions, like the addition of doctors to facilities run by the Customs and Border Protection agency. \u201cI got heat from my own party for ... making that point,\u201d she said of the vote. \u201cBut if we really want to pass a humanitarian bill, then let\u2019s pass a humanitarian bill. If it\u2019s not a humanitarian bill, don\u2019t call it a humanitarian bill.\u201d The event, which was translated into Spanish, Mandarin, Bangla, Tibetan, Nepali and American Sign Language in real time, felt like a window into an alternative progressive universe where the heavily populated, diverse and more liberal communities in coastal cities actually drove the policy agenda on Capitol Hill. Ocasio-Cortez even indulged the audience with her vision of a proactive immigration policy that does not merely react to Trump, but tears down barriers that preceded him. She called for making immigration enforcement a civil, rather than a criminal, matter once again. Her appeal echoes the message of former Housing Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, the only Latino presidential candidate, who has made turning unauthorized border crossing into a civil, rather than criminal, offense a cornerstone of his campaign. \u201cEspecially when it comes to immigration ... it feels like we\u2019re always coming from a defensive place. We\u2019re just trying to protect what we have,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to talk about the world that we want and are fighting for.\u201d Thanks to the existence of the Senate, partisan gerrymandering in the House and exaggerated fears of a mythical conservative swing voter, Democratic leaders in Congress are often cautious to the point of inaction. They are constantly seeking a balance between policies that curb Trump\u2019s worst excesses and more milquetoast maneuvers designed not to turn off the moderate voters they believe they need to win elections. It\u2019s a reality Ocasio-Cortez acknowledged, noting that her Democratic colleagues shot down an amendment to the defense budget she proposed that would have banned U.S. troops at the Southern border. House Armed Services Committee Chairman Adam Smith (D-Wash.) told HuffPost on Wednesday that the committee did not issue any recommendation to members on whether to vote for the amendment because of the objections of more moderate Democrats on the Homeland Security Committee. Even if Democrats have unified control of the federal government, Ocasio-Cortez said, \u201cthat doesn\u2019t mean that immigration policy is going to change. Because if we elect a party that thinks creating a humane border is going to lose them the election, they\u2019re not going to create that humane border.\u201d \u201cA lot of the work we need to do is cultural, because we need to make immigration policy a commonsense, non-radical thing,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez added. Perhaps in an attempt to move that cultural needle, Ocasio-Cortez did not repeat her characterization of the border detention centers as \u201cconcentration camps.\u201d She also sought to give historical context to another town hall speaker\u2019s call to dismantle the Department of Homeland Security, or DHS, noting that its creation in 2003 combined many federal agencies with different functions that could easily be spun off once more. \u201cReorganizing and getting rid of DHS is not as radical as George Bush\u2019s implementation and creation of DHS,\u201d she said. Whether Ocasio-Cortez will succeed in building more support for her policy agenda inside Congress with such arguments remains to be seen. But she has a powerful campaign war chest at her disposal and \u2015 as the ecstatic throngs of supporters who came to see her on a steamy Saturday attest \u2015 she enjoys a grassroots following that is likely unparalleled in the House. To the extent that her supporters were aware of Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s feud with Pelosi, they appeared to side with their congresswoman. \u201cPelosi needs to go. Her day has come and gone,\u201d said Rhoda Dunn, a real estate broker from Jackson Heights who brought a homemade \u201cWelcome Home AOC\u201d sign. Some of those in attendance were not even from the district, but had instead come from other parts of New York City to see the rockstar congresswoman in person. One such Ocasio-Cortez fan, Michael Howard, traveled from Far Rockaway, a neighborhood in southeast Queens represented by Rep. Gregory Meeks. Meeks succeeded Joe Crowley, whom Ocasio-Cortez ousted in June 2018, as chairman of the Queens County Democratic Party, and is a political adversary of Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s in borough politics. \u201cHer and these three other congresswomen who are trying to save this country more than anyone else in Washington, D.C. \u2015 they\u2019re like the Ninja Turtles,\u201d Howard said, referencing a popular culture franchise. \u201cAnd Bernie Sanders is Splinter,\u201d he added referencing the ninja turtles\u2019 fictional teacher.",

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) tweeted on Thursday. To respond, she attached a NowThis video of her with Reps. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) and Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) shouting, \u201cExperience doesn\u2019t pay the bills!\u201d The video was filmed for Pay Our Interns, a nonprofit group that advocates for more paid internships in the government, for-profit and nonprofit sectors. In September, Congress approved a spending package for the 2019 fiscal year that set aside about $14 million\u00a0to pay congressional interns, the first time that the Hill allocated funds for paid internships. The House received about $8.8 million to distribute across lawmakers\u2019 offices, and the Senate got $5 million. The appropriations bill added an average of $20,000 for each House member and $50,000 for each senator to pay interns. Last month, Pay Our Interns released the results\u00a0of its House internship audit and found that only 9% of congressional offices advertise paid internships, while 61% advertise that they don\u2019t offer paid internships. \u201cMany believe our work on Capitol Hill is done because Congress appropriated the funds, but these numbers prove that our work is only beginning,\u201d Pay Our Interns co-founder Guillermo Creamer said in a June 25 statement. \u201cIt is astonishing to see that so many offices have decided not to use any of the $20,000 allocated for intern pay. What is even more alarming is the percentage of offices that provide no information about intern salaries whatsoever.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez has pointedly advocated for a living wage for congressional interns. She said in December that all interns in her office would be paid $15 an hour with benefits, and announced in February that she would pay her staff no less than $52,000 a year. The amount, first reported by Roll Call, was almost unheard of for many congressional staff members in their 20s who work long hours with little to no pay.",

            "content": " President Barack Obama\u00a0on Wednesday mourned the death of former Supreme Court Justice\u00a0John Paul Stevens, who died the day before at age 99. Stevens retired from the high court in 2010 after serving on the bench for almost 35 years. He was the third-longest-serving justice of the Supreme Court. He died in a hospital in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, after a stroke. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have known Justice John Paul Stevens for all of his 99 years, but I\u2019m lucky enough to have known him for some of them,\u201d\u00a0Obama, who was president when Stevens retired, said in a statement. \u201cHe was a good man, a decent man. And our country is better because of his leadership and his example.\u201d \u201cFor more than 34 years on the bench at the Supreme Court, Justice Stevens heard cases with a level of grace, humility, and fidelity to our highest ideals that we should hope all our public servants strive for,\u201d Obama said. \u201cHis balancing of legal precedent with the Constitution\u2019s call for equal justice and an understanding of Americans\u2019 daily lives helped the court \u2014 and the country \u2014 navigate controversial and defining questions of who we are and who we can be. And in doing so with his signature pragmatism and modesty, he played a pivotal role in carrying forward our founding promise into today.\u201d Republican President Gerald Ford nominated Stevens, also a Republican, to the Supreme Court in 1975. Although he told The New York Times Magazine in 2007 that he thought of himself as \u201cpretty darn conservative,\u201d Stevens is often considered a liberal champion of the court. The justice wrote majority opinions on a wide range of issues, including abortion rights, capital punishment, school prayer and campaign-finance reform. Stevens led the high court\u2019s efforts to uphold legal protections for Guantanamo Bay prisoners after President George W. Bush\u2019s administration argued after the 9/11 attacks that prisoners there were not entitled to access to U.S. courts because they were not U.S. citizens and were being held on American soil. In retirement, Stevens remained an outspoken critic of the U.S. policy of detaining enemy combatants in Guantanamo without charges. In May 2012, Obama awarded Stevens a Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation\u2019s highest civilian honor, for his decadeslong career upholding the Constitution and the laws of the United States. \u201cKnown for his independent, pragmatic and rigorous approach to judging, Justice Stevens and his work have left a lasting imprint on the law in areas such as civil rights, the First Amendment, the death penalty, administrative law, and the separation of powers,\u201d the White House said at the time.

The statue, which was unveiled at the Elks Theatre in Rapid City on Saturday, depicts the former president waving one hand while holding hands with his younger daughter, who is also waving her other hand. The design was inspired by a photo of the former president with Sasha Obama at his first inauguration, the Rapid City Journal reported. Barack Obama joins other past U.S. presidents who were memorialized in the downtown area as part of the City of Presidents project that was launched in 2000 under the Rapid City Historic District Tour. The project aims to \u201chonor the legacy of the American presidency\u201d with sculptures positioned along the city\u2019s streets and sidewalks, its website states. Painter and sculptor James Van Nuys, who created the Barack Obama statue, told the Journal he was happy the board chose the design with Barack Obama and Sasha Obama. Dallerie Davis, the project\u2019s co-founder, said the group previously considered depicting Barack Obama waving by himself, before deciding on the final design. \u201cOne of us said, \u2018This is boring. This is not going to have the wow factor,\u2019\u201d Davis told CNN. \u201cA man waving is not a showstopper.\u201d All of the sculptures are privately funded, the project\u2019s website states. The Barack Obama sculpture has been designated to sit at the corner of Saint Joseph and 4th Streets in Rapid City, according to the project\u2019s website. Van Nuys told the crowd at the unveiling ceremony on Saturday that he felt a connection to the inauguration image of Barack Obama and Sasha Obama as a father himself, according to a live taping\u00a0by the South Dakota Public Broadcasting radio station. He shared that his daughter was his best friend when she was growing up, so seeing Barack Obama as a \u201cdad with his daughter\u201d held a special meaning for him.",

            "content": " A group backed by President Barack Obama will send experts to train people across the country on the ins-and-outs of redistricting as part an effort to fight excessive partisan gerrymandering. The new effort, called Redistricting U, comes as states are gearing up for the next round of redistricting, which will take place in 2021. The program will launch with trainings in dozens of cities across 10 states this fall aimed at teaching people the basics of the redistricting process. Organizers also want to connect gerrymandering to \u201cpocketbook issues\u201d and hope people will leave the trainings motivated to get involved in the redistricting process in their states, said Saumya Narechania, director of advocacy and campaign manager of All On The Line, the part of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee (NDRC) that will lead the effort. \u201cThe movement for fair maps will determine the course of progress on every issue we care about for the next decade. And we can\u2019t wait to begin organizing when the redistricting process starts in 2021. We need to build this movement from the ground up \u2014 right now,\u201d Obama said in a statement. Obama has been involved in efforts to limit excessive partisan gerrymandering since leaving office. Last year he folded his political group, Organizing for Action, into the NDRC, a redistricting-focused group led by Eric Holder, who served as attorney general for most of Obama\u2019s presidency. The redistricting process, which takes just once per decade, is expected to be a brutal brawl for partisan advantage. The United States Supreme Court ruled in June that there were no constitutional limits on how severely states could manipulate district lines to benefit political parties. For decades, redistricting in many places has been done behind closed doors, with lawmakers quietly negotiating deals to get the districts they want. Emails from lawmakers made public in litigation in Wisconsin, Michigan and Ohio, among other places, have shed light on just how unsavory those negotiations are. In Michigan, for example, a Republican staffer wrote happily about cramming \u201cDem garbage\u201d into four districts. Advocates have long struggled to get the public interested in redistricting, seen as a wonky, boring and complicated issue. But Obama and NDRC\u2019s decision to focus on the issue is a signal in itself of how the issue has exploded in recent years. In 2011, Republicans recognized the potential to use the redistricting process to lock in their political advantage for a decade and successfully executed a targeted campaign to do just that. The National Republican Redistricting Trust (NRRT), a GOP group focused on redistricting led by former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, mocked the new effort in a tweet. The group recently sued to block a new independent panel in Michigan from drawing district lines. The NDRC has dismissed the GOP-led criticism, noting that it has championed proposals with bipartisan support. \u201cI\u2019m not really that focused on what the NRRT is saying about us or our program,\u201d Narechania said. \u201cWe are hyperfocused on building a fair process and making sure that we are concentrating on places where redistricting reform gives power back to the people, not to politicians, not to the folks who are camped out in lobbyist offices who are drawing the lines in secret.\u201d \u201cThe whole point of All On The Line is to take this process and make it as transparent as possible. And if transparency is something that folks are afraid of, then I think the question is why is that?\u201d he said.",

He put out a statement Monday, after mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, claimed at least 31 lives and injured dozens more over the weekend. During his presidency, Obama spoke after more than\u00a0a dozen mass shootings, and memorably wept as he gave a speech\u00a0in the aftermath of the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School. \u201cNo other developed nation tolerates the levels of gun violence that we do,\u201d he said Monday. \u201cEvery time this happens, we\u2019re told that tougher gun laws won\u2019t stop all murders. \u2026 But the evidence shows that they can stop some killings.\u201d In El Paso, the shooter reportedly penned an anti-immigrant manifesto and was motivated by racist, white supremacist ideology. In his statement, Obama called for both law enforcement and internet platforms to increase efforts to reduce the influence of hate groups in radicalizing troubled individuals. He called on the country to \u201csend a clarion call and behave with the values of tolerance and diversity that should be the hallmark of our democracy.\u201d Though he did not name anyone in particular, much of what Obama condemned was speech used by his presidential successor, Donald Trump. \u201cWe should soundly reject language coming out of the mouths of any of our leaders that feeds a climate of fear and hatred or normalizes racist sentiments,\u201d the former president wrote. Trump\u00a0has faced heavy criticism for his own role in promoting the anti-immigrant rhetoric that the El Paso shooter espoused. In a statement Monday, Trump condemned white supremacy and racism, but did not acknowledge how his own comments had fueled such beliefs. \u201cSuch language isn\u2019t new \u2014 it\u2019s been at the root of most human tragedy throughout history,\u201d Obama wrote. \u201cIt has no place in our politics and our public life.

In one of the debate\u2019s\u00a0hottest exchanges, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey called out the former vice president \u2015 the frontrunner in the Democratic nomination race \u2015 for repeatedly using Obama\u2019s name to shield himself from criticism directed his way on issues like criminal justice and immigration. \u201cMr. vice president, you can\u2019t have it both ways,\u201d Booker said, referring to Biden\u2019s \u2015 and Obama\u2019s \u2015 record on immigration, which saw a record number of undocumented immigrants deported during their eight-year administration. \u201cYou invoke President Obama more than anybody in this campaign. You can\u2019t do it when it\u2019s convenient and then dodge it when it\u2019s not.\u201d Biden defended himself by noting Obama\u2019s decision to select him as his running mate, saying, \u201cBarack Obama knew exactly who I was.\u201d Also taking Biden to task on the deportation figures was Juli\u00e1n Castro \u2015 a particularly striking moment, since the Texan served in Obama\u2019s administration as secretary of housing and urban development. Biden spotlighted that, responding to Castro,\u00a0\u201cThe secretary, we sat together in many meetings. I never heard him talk about any of this when he was the secretary. Castro retorted: \u201cIt looks like one of us has learned from the lessons of the past and one of us hasn\u2019t.\u201d Polls show Obama remains a popular figure among all voters, with approval ratings easily outstripping those for President Donald Trump.\u00a0And among Democrats, Obama remains by far the most admired politician. Booker, in comments to CNN\u00a0on Thursday, insisted it wasn\u2019t a negative to reconsider part of the record of the Obama administration as part of the process of choosing the next Democratic presidential nominee. Democrats are \u201chaving an honest conversation about an administration that was incredible,\u201d Booker said.\u00a0\u201cAnd I\u2019m sure (if) Barack Obama was sitting here ... He will tell you, \u2018I made some mistakes.\u2019\u201d But several of Booker\u2019s Democratic Senate colleagues expressed concern about the tactic, arguing it would needlessly expose divisions in the party and take the focus off of Trump and his administration. \u201cI think attacking President Obama is bad policy and bad politics,\u201d Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut said Thursday. Of Biden\u2019s tenure as vice president, Blumenthal added: \u201cHe owns it, for better or worse. But he should be proud of it.\u201d Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois also suggested the Democratic race should be marked by a more hands-off approach toward Obama. \u201cYou can disagree with him, and I have, but the bottom line is ... he did an extraordinary job, and he should be given that recognition by those that are running for the presidency.\u201d Others who watched the debate expressed similar sentiments, including longtime Washington-based political analyst Stuart Rothenberg: Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York urged his party\u2019s White House contenders to train their sights firmly on Trump. \u201cI think President Obama is a very popular figure in America to this day because he did a very good job. Did he accomplish everything? No,\u201d Schumer told reporters on Thursday, \u201cYou compare the Obama administration to this administration \u2015 it\u2019s night and day.\u201d Veteran Republican political consultant John Weaver \u2015 a fierce Trump critic \u2015was blunter:",

            "author": "",
            "content": "COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) \u2014 Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders is proposing a criminal justice overhaul that aims to cut the nation\u2019s prison population in half, end mandatory minimum sentencing, ban private prisons and legalize marijuana. He says the current system does not fairly treat people of color, addicts or the mentally ill. \u201cWe have a system that imprisons and destroys the lives of millions of people,\u201d Sanders told The Associated Press before the planned released of his proposal Sunday. \u201cIt\u2019s racist in disproportionately affecting the African American and Latino communities, and it\u2019s a system that needs fundamental change.\u201d Sanders was promoting the plan during a weekend of campaigning in South Carolina, where the majority of the Democratic electorate is African American. The Vermont senator, who won the support of some younger black Democrats during the 2016 primary, has stepped up his references to racial disparities, particularly during stops in the South and urban areas. As president, Sanders said he would abolish mandatory minimum sentencing and reinstate a federal parole system, end the \u201cthree strikes law\u201d and expand the use of alternative sentencing, including community supervision and halfway houses. The goal is to reduce the prison population by one-half. \u201cA very significant number of people who are behind bars today are dealing with one form or another of illness,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cThese should be treated as health issues, not from a criminal perspective.\u201d According to the\u00a0National Alliance on Mental Illness\u00a0, 2 million people with mental illness are booked into jails annually. Taking aim at what his proposal calls \u201cfor-profit prison profiteering,\u201d Sanders would ban private prisons, make prison phone calls and other inmate communications free, and audit prison commissaries for price gouging and fees. The plan would legalize marijuana and expunge previous marijuana convictions, and end a cash bail system that Sanders says keeps hundreds of thousands who have not been convicted of a crime languishing in jail because they cannot afford bail. \u201cCan you believe that, in the year 2019, 400,000 people are in jail awaiting a trial because they are poor?\u201d Sanders said. \u201cThat is a moral outrage, it is a legal outrage.\u201d According to the\u00a0Prison Policy Initiative\u00a0, more than 460,000 people are being held in local jails around the country while they await trial, with a median bail amount of $10,000 for felony offenses. Sanders wants to improve relations between law enforcement agencies and the communities they serve. To do that, he proposes to end federal programs that provide military equipment to local police forces, establish federal standards for the use of body cameras, provide bias training and require that the Justice Department review all officer-involved shootings. \u201cYou have a lot of resentment in minority communities all over this country, who see police forces not as an asset but as an invading force,\u201d Sanders said. On capital punishment, Sanders\u2019 plan formalizes his call to end the federal death penalty and urges states to eliminate the punishment as well. \u201cWhen we talk about violence in society and trying to lower the levels of violence, it is not appropriate that the state itself is part of capital punishment,\u201d Sanders said. Sanders said that over the long term, his plan will save the public money because of reductions to overall incarceration costs. \u201cIt will cost money but it will pay for itself many, many times over,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cLocking people up is very, very expensive.\u201d ___ Kinnard can be reached at\u00a0http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP",

Bernie Sanders took a jab Tuesday at President Donald Trump over his remarks earlier that day accusing Jewish Americans who vote for Democrats\u00a0of being uninformed or disloyal. \u201cLet me say this to the president: I am a proud Jewish person, and I have no concerns about voting Democratic,\u201d the independent from Vermont told supporters at a campaign rally in Sioux City, Iowa. \u201cAnd in fact, I intend to vote for a Jewish man to become the next president of the United States.\u201d Sanders\u2019 comments were in response to Trump\u2019s remarks to reporters earlier Tuesday in the Oval Office. He said Jewish Americans who vote for Democrats show \u201ceither a total lack of knowledge or great disloyalty.\u201d Trump made the remark to reporters when speaking about Israel barring Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) from entering the country. While he did not specifically say who Democratic Jewish Americans would be disloyal to, he has previously called the Muslim congresswomen \u201canti-Israel\u201d and \u201canti-Semites,\u201d and equated Israel with all Jewish people. Nearly 80% of Jewish voters in the U.S. voted Democratic in the 2018 midterm elections, according to the Pew Research Center. Many Jewish groups, including the Jewish Democratic Council of America, said Trump was invoking the \u201cdual loyalty\u201d trope against Jewish Americans that is considered anti-Semitic. Sanders often references his family\u2019s experience in the Holocaust. His father migrated to the U.S. as a teenager, fleeing persecution in Poland. Sanders has also made it a point to balance talking about his Jewish heritage with his criticism of the Israeli government and its treatment of Palestinian people. The senator has continuously vocalized support for Omar and Tlaib, who are attacked daily for their criticism of Israel\u2019s government and their support for the pro-Palestinian Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement. After Israel announced its decision to bar the congresswomen, Omar stressed the need for more oversight of the billions of dollars the U.S. gives in aid to Israel every year. Sanders agreed with Omar, saying that Israel should decline U.S. aid if it\u2019s going to prevent a congresswoman from entering the country. \u201cIf Israel doesn\u2019t want members of the United States Congress to visit their country, to get a firsthand look at what\u2019s going on, and I have been there many, many times, but if [Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu] doesn\u2019t want members to visit, maybe he can respectfully decline the billions of dollars that we give to Israel,\u201d he said on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cAll In\u201d last week.

Bernie Sanders, a leading candidate for the Democratic Party\u2019s 2020 presidential nomination, rolled out a sweeping plan to expand the rights of workers and unions, including giving federal employees the right to strike, making it easier to form unions, eliminating so-called right-to-work laws and allowing unions in the same industry to jointly negotiate with employers. Sanders, who is currently in the top tier of candidates for the party\u2019s nomination, is competing for union endorsements with former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Sen. Kamala Harris (Calif.), and the plan could help woo organized labor in the critical early voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada. Unions can provide crucial volunteers and cash to help put campaigns over the top. The plan is based on the Workplace Democracy Act, legislation Sanders has introduced every year since he arrived in Congress in 1992. \u201cThere are many reasons for the growing inequality in our economy, but one of the most significant reasons for the disappearing middle class is that the rights of workers to join together and bargain for better wages, benefits, and working conditions have been severely undermined,\u201d Sanders\u2019 campaign wrote in rolling out the plan. The campaign said Sanders would aim to double union membership during his first four-year term in office. Union membership has long been in decline in the United States, and only about 1 in 10 workers are members of a union today. Sanders and other progressives have long argued the decline of unions has been a leading driver of economic inequality \u2015 unionized employees typically make more money and are more likely to have health coverage and strong retirement plans. By executive order, Sanders would require federal contractors to take steps to make their workplaces more employee-friendly: They\u2019d be barred from outsourcing jobs, paying their CEOs more than 150 times what their average worker makes and be required to pay workers at least $15 an hour. He\u2019d also push to give federal employees the ability to strike for the first time. Other steps would require a friendly Congress: Sanders would propose eliminating the section of the Taft-Hartley Act that allows states to adopt right-to-work laws that undermine unions. He\u2019d also seek to make union organizing easier with majority sign-up, also known as \u201ccard check.\u201d His plan would seek to bar corporations from forcing employees to attend anti-union meetings and would push for a law guaranteeing the ability of public sector workers to collectively bargain. The last provision could prove particularly popular in Iowa. In 2017, the state\u2019s Republican-controlled government passed a law that said public employees in the Hawkeye State could negotiate only over wages, not for health care or other benefits. Another major union priority included in the plan and that would require congressional approval is sectoral bargaining, which allows unions across a single industry to bargain together and set universal standards for wages and benefits.",

            "author": "Nick Visser",
            "content": " Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) unveiled a sweeping plan to protect American journalism on Monday, decrying President Donald Trump\u2019s attacks on the media, a spate of megamergers of media companies and the rise of Silicon Valley behemoths leeching advertising dollars from the news industry. \u201cToday, after decades of consolidation and deregulation, just a small handful of companies control almost everything you watch, read, and download,\u201d Sanders, a 2020 presidential candidate, wrote in the Columbia Journalism Review. \u201cGiven that reality, we should not want even more of the free press to be put under the control of a handful of corporations and \u2018benevolent\u2019 billionaires who can use their media empires to punish their critics and shield themselves from scrutiny.\u201d Read the full article in the Columbia Journalism Review. Newsroom employment across the U.S. has plummeted since 2008, and the Pew Research Center said last month that the total number of journalism jobs was slashed by nearly a quarter over the past decade. The cuts were largely seen at newspapers, but other massive digital enterprises have seen dramatic rounds of layoffs in recent years, including BuzzFeed, Vice and HuffPost. From January to May of this year, about 3,000 people working in the news industry were laid off or offered a buyout package, according to an analysis by Bloomberg. At the same time, news companies have been scrambling for ways to become profitable as traditional advertising dollars dry up (or hunted for billionaire benefactors, such as Jeff Bezos\u2019 purchase of The Washington Post or Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong\u2019s of the Los Angeles Times). Sanders noted that much of that cash still exists, and as of this year, digital advertising\u00a0outpaces both print and television ad revenue.\u00a0But the money largely flows to Google and Facebook, who control about 60% of the digital advertising market. \u201cWe need to rebuild and protect a diverse and truly independent press so that real journalists can do the critical jobs that they love, and that a functioning democracy requires,\u201d Sanders said. Were he to unseat Trump in the 2020 election, Sanders said he would issue an \u201cimmediate moratorium\u201d on mergers of major media corporations and instead focus on protections for local, independent news outlets. The senator also said he would appoint an attorney general to oversee tech giants like Facebook and Google to stop efforts to \u201ccannibalize, bilk, and defund news organizations.\u201d \u201cTrump\u2019s authoritarian bullying of the media is totally unacceptable and it must be denounced and rejected,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut let us be clear: that alone will not solve the journalism crisis. Moreover, a further expansion of oligarchic business models in the media industry could make matters worse.\u201d Sanders said he planned to further support initiatives to unionize newsrooms as well as pushing for a plan that could see employees buy their media outlets through a stock-ownership plan before the companies are sold. Sanders has been a leading contender among the crowded Democratic presidential field. A new national poll released Monday showed the senator in a virtual three-way tie with former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) (although it\u2019s still early to put much faith in such numbers before the primaries even begin, and other polls have had different results). Recode\u00a0notes\u00a0that the Sanders campaign has\u00a0grown frustrated with the media\u00a0in the past, lambasting the \u201ccorporate media\u201d at times. Earlier this month, Sanders suggested that\u00a0Bezos influenced The Washington Post\u2019s coverage\u00a0and was more critical of him than other candidates. The remarks prompted the executive editor of the Post to fire back,\u00a0calling the idea a \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d\u00a0while assuring readers that the newspaper operates with \u201cfull independence.\u201d Regardless of the tiff, the plan presents a dramatic and novel effort among the Democratic candidates to better protect a free press, a far cry from Trump\u2019s blistering criticism of anyone and everyone critical of his administration. \u201cOur constitution\u2019s First Amendment explicitly protects the free press because the founders understood how important journalism is to a democracy,\u201d Sanders wrote on Monday. \u201cMore than two centuries after the constitution was signed, we cannot sit by and allow corporations, billionaires, and demagogues to destroy the Fourth Estate, nor can we allow them to replace serious reporting with infotainment and propaganda.\u201d",

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) have organized and hosted over 11,000 events, including more than 2,000 in California, the campaign announced Tuesday evening. The vast majority of the events have been organized by volunteers, according to the campaign. The achievement, which top Sanders campaign organizers revealed in a conference call with over 7,000 supporters, reflects what the Sanders campaign sees as a secret weapon as it seeks to stand out in a crowded field of candidates: a \u201cdistributed\u201d \u2015 or volunteer-run \u2015 organizing system that it innovated in the 2016 race and has since fine-tuned. Joining the call with volunteers after several of his advisers spoke, Sanders affirmed that, although the campaign would engage in conventional tactics like television and radio advertisements, its strength was the devotion of its supporters, many of whom have become volunteers. \u201cWe are going to win this campaign because we ... are going to have the strongest grassroots movement of any campaign,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is how we win this thing. We win this going to our base, our strength of support.\u201d The conceit of distributed organizing, which has its fair share of skeptics, is that campaigns can amplify by orders of magnitude the effect of the staff they employ directly by empowering exceptionally motivated volunteers to run their own house parties, lead their own canvasses and develop, and monitor their own voter contacts by phone and text message. It differs from traditional campaign volunteering in terms of the resources and technology the Sanders campaign, and others inspired by it, have expended on creating an infrastructure to facilitate the work of its most dedicated supporters. It will be difficult to fully measure the organizing technique\u2019s effectiveness prior to Feb. 3, when Sanders competes in Iowa\u2019s Democratic caucus. On Tuesday evening\u2019s call, the campaign said its staff and volunteers had made 2 million calls and sent 30 million text messages to voters in early states. It also recently concluded a two-week campus organizing boot camp, or \u201csummer school,\u201d that it says graduated more than 1,500 college and graduate school students who plan to serve as campaign ambassadors and organizers at their universities. A viral initiative earlier this month asking Sanders supporters to share on social media the life experience that brought them to the campaign \u2015 dubbed \u201c#MyBernieStory\u201d \u2015 doubled as a volunteer recruitment technique. The campaign directed Sanders supporters who used the campaign\u2019s organizing app, Bern, to post \u201c#MyBernieStory\u201d on Twitter or Facebook to use a digital tool to contact several other voters by text message and encourage them to get involved in the campaign. The campaign estimates that it reached the equivalent number of voters through those digitally facilitated connections as it would normally reach from knocking on 63,000 doors. Critics of distributed organizing argue that it is no substitute for the professionally run field organizing teams that have powered successful presidential campaigns. And on that front, Sanders got a later start than some of his rivals, beginning hiring field organizers in the early states only in May. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, by contrast, already had 50 staff members in Iowa by that time. The Sanders campaign insists, though, that distributed organizing aims not to supplant traditional field organizing but to magnify its impact. It now has dozens of paid, full-time field organizers in each of the four early states of Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina, as well as in California, a Super Tuesday state with a primary open to all registered voters. The conference call noted the campaign\u2019s distributed organizing strategy has gone from identifying and recruiting volunteers to now putting that volunteer army to work more aggressively. Campaign organizing leaders invited call participants to volunteer in real time to host a \u201cPlan to Win\u201d house party in September, where volunteers will bond with their peers and receive marching orders for the next phase of the campaign. The campaign said it received 1,700 commitments from volunteers on the call to host such house parties. The Sanders campaign is hoping to capitalize on the momentum it has developed in recent weeks after a series of high-profile policy rollouts and endorsements, including his first official declaration of support from a national labor union. The Sanders campaign, which has tangled bitterly with media outlets and pollsters for what it believes is bias against the Vermont senator,\u00a0touted a national poll released Monday that showed Sanders in a statistical three-way tie for first place with Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden. But Sanders still trails Biden in the averages of polls in Iowa and New Hampshire, states that are essential to his success. His campaign has argued that polls, which generally survey a universe of likely voters, do not account for the ways in which his campaign is seeking to turn out infrequent and new voters often left out of polling.\u00a0At least one leading pollster has disputed the Sanders campaign\u2019s analysis of the polls\u2019 shortcomings. Still, the Sanders campaign believes its success hinges on reaching those non-traditional voters \u2015 and sees its volunteer force as a key tool to do it. \u201cWe will win this election \u2015 we will win the Democratic nomination, we will defeat Trump \u2015 because we are going to bring out people who, in many cases, have not participated in politics before,\u201d Sanders said Tuesday evening. \u201cAnd I\u2019m talking about a generation of young people who in my view are the most progressive generation in the history of our country \u2015 anti-racist, anti-sexist, anti-homophobia, anti-religious bigotry.\u201d",

            "content": "NEW YORK \u2014 In an interview with Yahoo News last Thursday, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., brushed off the possibility that he and Sen. Elizabeth Warren could split the progressive vote, creating an easy path for former Vice President Joe Biden to win the Democratic presidential primary. As it stands now, polls show Sanders and Warren vying for second place behind Biden even though the combined bloc supporting the two progressives is larger than that of the ex-vice president. Sanders and Warren have broadly similar platforms. While\u00a0there are some differences\u00a0between their approaches, they both support Sanders\u2019s signature Medicare for All public health care plan, large increases in spending to fight climate change, and programs to cut student debt and expand affordable housing. Biden has far more moderate positions, including a health care plan that would\u00a0preserve private insurance\u00a0and\u00a0more modest spending\u00a0to address climate change. And while Biden has called for\u00a0increased education spending, unlike Warren and Sanders, he hasn\u2019t backed plans to make public colleges fully tuition free and to eliminate large amounts of student debt. Sanders has said Biden doesn\u2019t share his \u201cvision\u201d for the country. Still, when asked about the possibility that having two progressive candidates will end up dooming them both, Sanders offered a one word response. \u201cNope,\u201d he said. \u201cI think there is a political process, and people will make their own choices,\u201d Sanders added. \u201cBut I\u2019m feeling pretty good about the future.\u201d The Vermont senator stressed that he is \u201cconfident\u201d about his organization in key early states. \u201cWe\u2019re a long way away from election day in Iowa. I think It\u2019s about five months, and a lot can change. All I can say is that given the grassroots movement that we have in Iowa, in New Hampshire, Nevada, South Carolina, California, I\u2019m feeling pretty good that we\u2019re going to win those states,\u201d said Sanders. While Sanders and Warren share similar policy goals, there are some indications their bases of support are\u00a0quite different, and if one dropped out, the supporters wouldn\u2019t necessarily migrate to the remaining candidate. But Sanders offered a message to any progressives who might be choosing between him and Warren. When asked about the distinctions between the two, Sanders emphasized his record and role in pushing the Democratic Party to the left since his last run for president in 2016. \u201cWhat I would say is, if you look at the issues that folks are talking about today \u2014 not only candidates but people all over this country \u2014 that has a lot to do with my willingness four years ago to stand up to the political establishment, the economic establishment, the media establishment, and say, \u2018You know what? Maybe we need policies and a government that represents all of us and not just wealthy campaign contributors,\u2019\u201d Sanders said. While Warren is mounting her first presidential campaign and doesn\u2019t have as long a political career as Sanders, she was a prominent advocate for reducing income inequality during her prior academic career. Since she was elected to the Senate in 2012, Warren has, like Sanders, pushed for dramatic expansions to public education and health care programs. Sanders said he\u2019s pleased other candidates are supporting aspects of his agenda, including universal health care, free public education and aggressive steps to fight climate change. \u201cThese are issues that I talked about in a very aggressive way. I am proud that other candidates are coming onboard,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cBut I think that if you check my record, I have a life of standing up to the very powerful special interests and fighting for working people.\u201d Yahoo News pressed Sanders on whether he was implying that he \u201cpaved the way\u201d for Warren\u2019s candidacy. \u201cWell I don\u2019t want to talk about Elizabeth Warren or anybody else; [it\u2019s] not a question of paving the way. Everybody comes to their own views,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cAll I can say is that for the last many decades, going back to when I was elected mayor of Burlington, my record has been standing up for working families, taking on powerful special interests and, in fact, achieving some real results.\u201d Sanders, who has the largest number of individual donors so far, went on to say he\u2019s \u201cproud of the record that I have right now in putting together the strongest grassroots movement \u2026 for a political campaign this country has ever seen.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m confident we\u2019re going to win this election,\u201d said Sanders.",

            "author": "Daniel Marans",
            "content": " Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who represent the Democratic Party\u2019s more progressive wing, draw more frequent comparisons than any other 2020 primary candidates. News outlets have doggedly documented the two candidates\u2019 subtle differences and, as Warren has climbed in opinion polls, have implied that her rise has come at Sanders\u2019 expense. But the Sanders campaign does not see it that way. His aides argue that they are competing more heavily to win over voters who gravitate toward former Vice President Joe Biden, rather than Warren or any other candidate. Biden, the Sanders campaign believes, attracts the older working-class voters \u2015 of all races \u2015 with whom Sanders eventually gained traction in the 2016 election cycle. \u201cBernie appeals to younger working-class voters. Biden appeals to older working-class voters,\u201d Ben Tulchin, the Sanders\u2019 campaign\u2019s chief pollster, told HuffPost. \u201cThe latter are some of the same voters Bernie won over last time. Our view is that we can win them back again, especially talking about his core economic message.\u201d \u201cWhen Bernie talks about a rigged economy propped up by a corrupt political system, that really resonates,\u201d he added. In keeping with this approach, the Sanders campaign\u2019s text messaging program has a specific response for voters who say they are supporting Biden. It also has a response for voters who say they are backing Sanders, but only a general response for cases where they say they are supporting any other candidate. The Sanders campaign, which claims to have sent 30 million text messages to voters, shared with HuffPost a text message that a volunteer sent a Nevada voter who said they were deciding between Sanders and Biden. \u201cThanks for letting me know!\u201d the volunteer replied. \u201cDid you know that Joe Biden told a room full of Wall Street billionaire donors that \u2018nothing would fundamentally change\u2019 if he became president? I\u2019m for Bernie because he DOES think we need major change.\u201d That pitch seemed to work. The voter eventually said they\u2019d be backing Sanders. Biden did indeed tell a room full of wealthy donors that \u201cnothing will fundamentally change\u201d for them at a June fundraiser. His campaign maintains that Biden\u2019s full remarks show he was saying that wealthy people would not need to give up their standard of living in order to enact policies that lift up all Americans. Whether one considers the volunteer\u2019s texting appeal fair or not, it is a taste of the kind of contrast Sanders hopes to draw with Biden, who has deployed populist rhetoric about bridging the income gap but has often supported business-friendly policies and courted the party\u2019s donor class over the course of four and a half decades in politics. (Neither Sanders nor Warren use private fundraisers to solicit big donations.) Trade is an area where Sanders believes he has a significant advantage over Biden with older working-class voters, particularly in industrial states like Iowa, a caucus state that hosts the first contest of the presidential primary on Feb. 3. Sanders voted against the North American Free Trade Agreement and permanent normal trade relations with China, which cost the United States blue-collar manufacturing jobs. Biden supported both. Sanders also opposed the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the now-defunct trade agreement that Biden promoted in his capacity as then-President Barack Obama\u2019s vice president. Exit polling suggests that drawing a contrast with Hillary Clinton\u2019s pro-free-trade record helped Sanders pull off a pivotal upset in the Michigan primary in March 2016. The campaign also sees Sanders\u2019 plans to reduce the high cost of prescription drugs \u2014 which even voters on Medicare struggle to pay \u2014 and his long-standing support for expanding Social Security benefits as key selling points for older working-class voters. One of Biden\u2019s main messages though, is that he\u2019s the most electable candidate. He can win against Trump, he says, in part because he\u2019s more moderate than Sanders and Warren. But Tulchin said voters concerned about electability tend to skew more educated and affluent, which are not the primary targets of Sanders\u2019 class-centric message anyway. \u201cThe more upscale you go, the less well Bernie does,\u201d he said. Tulchin emphasized that though Sanders believes he can win over some of the white working-class voters who voted for Obama in 2012 and subsequently switched to Trump, the campaign believes his message has appeal with working-class Black and Latino voters as well.\u00a0The campaign is optimistic about Sanders\u2019 chances in Nevada, where the disproportionately working-class Latino population makes up a large share of the electorate. (An average of public polls in the state nonetheless shows Sanders\u00a0tied for second place with Warren.) Tulchin told HuffPost that public polling data so far supports the campaign\u2019s view that Biden voters have a similar socioeconomic profile to Sanders voters. In a national poll conducted by Monmouth University in late August, Sanders came in first place among Democratic voters without a four-year college degree, with 24% support. He was followed by Biden, who had 18%, and Warren, who had 17%. In the same survey, Biden and Sanders both had similarly high favorability ratings among both college-educated and non-college-educated voters, while Warren had a favorability rating with college-educated Democrats that was 20 percentage points higher than among those without a degree. (Sen. Kamala Harris of California and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg enjoyed a favorability edge among college-educated voters at least as large as Warren\u2019s.) In addition, Morning Consult\u2019s national poll in late August shows that Biden supporters would pick Sanders as their second choice and vice versa. But the public opinion research is vast enough that other polls offer contradictory data. For example, a late August poll released by Quinnipiac University found that Sanders trails Biden among Democrats earning less than $50,000 a year, and lags behind both Biden and Warren among white voters without a college degree. And a Pew Research Center poll from mid-August found that more Biden voters would pick Warren or Harris as their second choice than would pick Sanders. Neither the Biden campaign nor the Warren campaign responded to a request for comment for this story. Over Labor Day weekend, HuffPost interviewed 35 voters at three Sanders rallies in New Hampshire and Maine; a Warren rally in New Hampshire; and a Labor Day breakfast in Maine hosted by local labor unions. There was plenty of affinity for Biden \u2015 and Warren \u2015 amongst the Sanders supporters. Of the 15 Sanders supporters with whom HuffPost spoke, voters cited Biden as their second choice just as frequently as they named Warren. (Some, though, were unwilling countenance a Sanders loss. Others named other second-choice candidates.) Wayne McAllister, 30, who came to see Sanders in Raymond, New Hampshire, on Sunday with his wife Ryann, 24, volunteered for conservative Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) in the 2016 election cycle. He got turned onto Sanders\u2019 message \u2015 and progressive politics more broadly \u2015 after joining the Iron Workers Local 7 union, which endorsed Sanders in 2016. \u201cHis message is pretty much what the labor movement was, which is: power to the people, band together, take down corporations \u2015 or at least keep them in check to make sure they don\u2019t hold too many of the cards, that the worker still has a voice, that the worker still has a say in the matter of what happens,\u201d McAllister said. And Biden would be his second choice, McAllister said, because he\u2019s \u201cone of the elder statesmen, been around for a while.\u201d Joe Piccone, who works for Teamsters union Local 340 in Maine and attended the Labor Day breakfast in Portland, Maine, said he was backing Sanders because Sanders is a \u201cpro-labor guy.\u201d Biden is the only other person who Piccone said he feels confident would also fight for unions. Biden \u201chas a track record with labor that I\u2019m familiar with,\u201d Piccone said. \u201cThat\u2019s not being critical of Elizabeth Warren \u2015 that\u2019s saying I\u2019m going with a known entity.\u201d But in a clear example of why the Sanders campaign isn\u2019t focusing on Warren supporters, just one of the 10 voters who told HuffPost they\u2019re backing the Massachusetts senator said Sanders was their second choice. Lisa Wenger, a public school teacher who came to see Warren speak in Hampton Falls, New Hampshire, on Monday and said that Warren\u2019s speech won her over, considers Sanders \u201ctoo far left.\u201d Asked what she makes of people who liken Warren to Sanders, Wenger said, \u201cThat\u2019s just a bunch of meshugas.\u201d",

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on Tuesday pointed to global warming as a major cause of Hurricane Dorian, which has pummeled the Bahamas\u00a0with devastating winds and massive flooding and is slowly churning toward the coast of Florida. In a tweet, the Democratic presidential candidate slammed the fossil fuel industry for wreaking havoc on the environment, arguing that it \u201ccreates death and destruction, then spends billions denying its responsibility.\u201d \u201cLet us be clear: Hurricane Dorian has everything to do with climate change, which is the existential crisis of our time,\u201d he added. Sanders\u2019 remarks were spurred by a New York Times op-ed on worsening hurricanes, which was shared by the New Consensus, a liberal think tank helping to develop the Green New Deal. Sander\u2019s is a co-sponsor of a version of the Green New Deal. which proposes a broad range of environmental and economic initiatives and has been closely linked to freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.). As of Tuesday, Dorian had wound down from a Category 5 storm to a Category 2. It was initially able to gain significant force by feeding on warm ocean waters. Though it may be too early to determine the exact impact of climate change on the hurricane\u2019s development, the warming of the planet\u2019s oceans seems to have fueled upticks in the intensity of hurricanes. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, more than 90% of Earth\u2019s warming over the last 50 years has occurred in the planet\u2019s oceans, where heat is absorbed much more readily than on land. The 2018 National Climate Assessment, published by the federally mandated U.S. Global Change Research Program, pointed to the rise in greenhouse gasses as a contributing factor in triggering hurricane activity in the Atlantic Ocean region. It also attributed the intensity of the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season to \u201ca combination of natural and human-caused\u201d elements. That year\u2019s hurricanes included Harvey, Irma, Jose and Maria \u2015 each of which reached Category 5 or 4 intensity.",

Sanders, a fierce critic of income inequality who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, identifies the explosion in compensation for top corporate executives as a key factor depressing ordinary workers\u2019 wages. \u201cAt a time of massive income and wealth inequality, the American people are demanding that large, profitable corporations pay their fair share of taxes,\u201d Sanders said in a statement accompanying the plan. \u201cIt is time to send a message to corporate America: If you do not end your greed and corruption, we will end it for you.\u201d Sanders\u2019 proposal, which applies to publicly and privately held companies with annual revenue of $100 million or more, would increase companies\u2019 corporate tax rate by 0.5 percentage points if their CEO received compensation worth between 50 and 100 times what the company\u2019s median employee earned. The higher a company\u2019s CEO-to-median worker pay ratio would go, the higher the surtax it would endure under Sanders\u2019 plan. The legislation would levy a 1-point tax hike on companies with CEO-to-median worker ratios between 100-to-1 and 200-to-1; a 2-point tax hike for those with ratios between 200-to-1 and 300-to-1; a 3-point tax hike for those with ratios between 300-to-1 and 400-to-1; a 4-point tax hike for those with ratios between 400-to-1 and 500-to-1; and a 5-point tax hike for those with ratios of more than 500-to-1. CEO pay has exploded relative to the compensation received by ordinary workers in the past few decades. In 2018, the average CEO-to-median worker pay of a corporation in the S&P 500 index was 287-to-1, according to an AFL-CIO analysis of data collected by the federal government. Prior to the 1970s, the gap between executive pay and that of ordinary workers at their companies was dramatically narrower. CEO compensation, including stock options, at the biggest 350 firms grew 940% since 1978, even as typical worker pay climbed just 12% over the same period, according to an analysis by the Economic Policy Institute. The EPI analysis, which looks at average, rather than median, worker compensation, found that the CEO-to-average worker pay ratio went from 20-to-1 in 1965 to 58-to-1 in 1989 to 278-to-1 in 2018. The Institute for Policy Studies, a left-leaning Washington think tank,\u00a0released a report documenting high CEO pay on Monday as well. The report found that at 50 publicly-traded companies with the highest CEO-to-median worker pay gaps, the median worker would have to work 1,000 years to earn the CEO\u2019s pay. The Sanders campaign estimates that if companies increased median worker pay to $60,000 a year and capped CEO pay at $3 million, no company would pay additional taxes under his plan. Assuming that corporate behavior does not change, however, the plan would raise an additional $150 billion in revenue over a 10-year period, which Sanders would use to fund his plan to cancel Americans\u2019 $81 billion in medical debt. \u201cThe American people are sick and tired of corporate CEOs who now make 300 times more than their average employees, while they give themselves huge bonuses and cut back on the healthcare and pension benefits of their employees,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cThey want corporations to invest in their workers, not just dividends, stock buybacks and outrageous compensation packages to their executives.\u201d A February 2016 survey conducted by Stanford University broadly affirms Sanders\u2019 suggestion that his proposal is popular. The poll found that while Americans usually underestimate how much CEOs get paid, nearly two-thirds \u2015 62% \u2015 support capping their compensation, though just 49% said they wanted changes to come through government intervention. Sanders is locked in something of an arms race of economic populism with Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who now leads him in public Democratic primary polls of Iowa and New Hampshire. Last week, Sanders unveiled a plan to tax the wealth of the richest 0.1% of households at gradually increasing rates. It goes considerably further than a proposal Warren released in January, prior to Sanders\u2019 entry in the race, that would impose a 2% tax on wealth above $50 million. Although Warren has not proposed a similar plan to tax CEO pay, legislation she introduced in August 2018, the Accountable Capitalism Act, would, among other things, require corporations to allow employees to elect 40% of corporate board members. The change could reduce CEO pay by giving workers a greater say in executive compensation.",

Sanders spent $1.3 million on the ad buy in Iowa, the first state to vote in the Democratic primary.

The announcement for the ad came shortly after Sanders\u2019 campaign revealed that the senator raised $25.3 million from about 1.4 million donations in the past three months. However successful his fundraising, Sanders was still dragging behind Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden at third place in a recent poll of likely Democratic caucus attendees in Iowa. Warren, who surged in the poll as Biden fell to second place, made an aggressive ad buy last week, spending at least $10 million in advertising in the first four states to vote in the 2020 Democratic primary, including Iowa.",

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) raised $25.3 million in the third quarter of 2019, a sum that came from around 1.4 million donations, his campaign reported\u00a0 Tuesday. \u201cBernie is proud to be the only candidate running to defeat Donald Trump who is 100 percent funded by grassroots donations \u2013 both in the primary and in the general,\u201d Faiz Shakir, Sanders\u2019 campaign manager, said in a statement. \u201cMedia elites and professional pundits have tried repeatedly to dismiss this campaign, and yet working-class Americans keep saying loudly and clearly that they want a political revolution.\u201d The third quarter ended Monday, and all 2020 candidates must report their fundraising totals to the Federal Election Commission by Oct. 15. It\u2019s unclear how Sanders\u2019 third-quarter haul stacks up against his fellow candidates, but the senator has long been in the top echelon of fundraising, leaning on the support of small-dollar donations that propelled him forward in 2016. Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), Mayor Pete Buttigieg and former Vice President Joe Biden had all also\u00a0raised more than $20 million by the end of July, while other candidates have struggled to hit those targets, according to Open Secrets. Sanders\u2019 campaign said Tuesday he had raised a total of $61.5 million since he unveiled his bid for the White House, noting that 99.9% of donors hadn\u2019t yet maxed out how much they\u2019re legally allowed to give. An additional $2.6 million was transferred to the campaign from other campaign accounts. Some Democrats had been ringing the alarm bells to their supporters as the deadline loomed. Sen. Cory Booker (N.J.) said last month that his campaign was considering dropping out of the race if it didn\u2019t reach a self-imposed goal of $1.7 million for the quarter (his team said they \u201cblew past\u201d that total this weekend). Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro\u2019s campaign also sent out a stark fundraising email in recent days, although his team later said it wasn\u2019t a signal that he planned to leave the race. Candidates\u2019 number of donors will come into play for the Democratic National Committee\u2019s upcoming debates in November. That event will have a higher threshold, mandating candidates have at least 165,000 individual donors as well as reaching at least 3% in at least four approved polls of Democratic voters. President Donald Trump, on the other hand, has already amassed a gargantuan war chest, raising more than $200 million from his campaign committee and outside groups. His campaign has not yet filed its FEC disclosures for the third quarter.",

            "content": " Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on Monday released a plan that would eliminate some of the last unrestrained corporate spending in Democratic politics, by banning corporate funding for the party\u2019s nominating convention and presidential inauguration events. Sanders\u2019 proposal to \u201cget corporate money out of politics\u201d\u00a0\u2015 the first plan his presidential campaign has released since he was hospitalized for a heart attack last week \u2015 would, among other things, ensure public financing of federal elections, create a new federal elections oversight board, prohibit advertising during presidential primary debates, and enact a lifetime lobbying ban for former members of Congress and top staffers. But replacing corporations\u2019 sponsorship of the Democratic National Convention with a public financing system is both the most ambitious and the most controversial element of Sanders\u2019 proposal. Seventeen donors were responsible for contributing three-quarters of the funding for the party\u2019s 2016 convention in Philadelphia, including a $5.6 million in-kind donation from Comcast for broadcast and internet services. Sanders said his own campaign\u2019s success raising money in small increments \u2015 he topped the Democratic presidential field with a $25.3 million haul in the third quarter of this year \u2015 shows that corporate money and wealthy donors are not necessary. \u201cOur grassroots-funded campaign is proving every single day that you don\u2019t need billionaires and private fundraisers to run for president,\u201d Sanders said in a statement accompanying the plan. \u201cWhen we win the Democratic nomination and defeat Donald Trump, we will transform our political system by rejecting the influence of big corporate money.\u201d Some of the other changes Sanders proposes include banning lobbyist and corporate PAC donations to the Democratic National Committee if he is the Democratic presidential nominee, barring former DNC chairs and vice chairs from lobbying, and capping individual contributions to official inauguration committees at $500. He would also seek to pass a constitutional amendment clarifying that money is not equivalent to speech and that corporations do not have the legal status of individuals, thereby eliminating key legal justifications for court rulings striking down campaign finance regulations. As Democrats have grown warier of corporate influence in politics, the party\u2019s national convention every four years \u2014 which is overwhelmed by corporate spending and lobbyist influence peddling\u00a0\u2014\u00a0has attracted more scrutiny from good government advocates and progressive activists. Meanwhile, the DNC\u2019s convention CEO, Joe Solmonese, has already set out to court corporate sponsors to raise upward of $70 million for the party\u2019s nominating convention in Milwaukee in July 2020.\u00a0Perks for six-figure donors include VIP convention credentials and box seats to attend the proceedings. That makes the convention a natural target for Sanders, an independent who has long been antagonistic toward the donors and insiders that play an outsize role in Democratic Party politics. \u201cWhen Bernie is the nominee, everything will fundamentally change for corporate elites,\u201d Josh Orton, the Sanders campaign\u2019s policy director, said in a statement. \u201cA Bernie Sanders convention will be a people-powered convention.\u201d Sanders\u2019 proposal is likely to raise questions about his ability and willingness to compete with President Donald Trump, who will have virtually limitless cash to finance a rival convention. A convention provides a political party a key opportunity to introduce its presidential and vice presidential nominees to a national audience on live television. Of course, it is much easier to swear off high-dollar private fundraisers \u2015 as Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) have done \u2015 in a presidential primary. It is harder to replace multimillion-dollar corporate checks that come in for the convention than\u00a0the $2,800 checks that closed-door fundraisers earn candidates in primaries. Sanders\u2019 proposal differs from that of Warren, a fellow economic populist who has surpassed him in national and early-state primary polls.\u00a0In an anti-corruption proposal released in September, Warren suggested a lifetime ban on lobbying for former members of Congress, presidents, vice presidents, Cabinet secretaries and federal judges.\u00a0But she does not yet have a major plan to reform campaign financing, including how the national political conventions are financed. Warren has also said that she would resume soliciting big checks in private fundraisers if she were the Democratic presidential nominee, arguing that to do otherwise would amount to \u201cunilateral disarmament\u201d against Trump and the Republicans. Sanders, by contrast, has said he would not change his ban on the policy.",

Sanders, 78, was treated in Las Vegas, Nevada, with the insertion of two stents to unclog one of his arteries. On Friday, he emerged from the hospital alongside his wife Jane with a triumphant fist in the air, recorded a video for his supporters on social media, and returned home to Burlington, Vermont. He and his wife took a walk in the rain on Monday, which CNN captured on camera. In addition to facing the politically tricky task of persuading primary voters that a septuagenarian heart attack survivor is up to the task of winning the White House, the Sanders campaign is already working to quiet skepticism of its immediate response to his ailment. Nearly three days passed between Sanders\u2019 hospitalization and the announcement on Friday that he had suffered a heart attack. Sanders\u2019 team maintains that they provided the accurate medical information as soon as it was available; they were not sure of the diagnosis until he was discharged from the hospital. In keeping with a mid-September promise, Sanders will be releasing his full medical records in the near future, though the campaign did not provide any additional details about timing. The Sanders campaign did its best to continue with business as usual in the days following his hospitalization. Over the weekend, the campaign dispatched three of its co-chairs \u2015 former Ohio state Sen. Nina Turner, California Rep. Ro Khanna and San Juan, Puerto Rico, Mayor Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz \u2015 to barnstorm the early primary states with a packed schedule of events. And early Monday morning, the campaign released Sanders\u2019 plan to get corporate money out of politics, including the cash-riddled presidential nominating conventions. Sanders will have his first chance to demonstrate his vitality at the fourth Democratic presidential debate in Westerville, Ohio, on Oct. 15. The Vermont senator does not have any public events planned prior to the debate; he canceled a scheduled appearance at an LGBTQ town hall on CNN this Thursday. In the meantime, the campaign is keen to showcase the strength of Sanders\u2019 support network, which appears to have been inspired by his hospitalization to redouble their efforts on his behalf. The campaign announced on Sunday that its staff and volunteers had met its goal of making 1 million phone calls to voters in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, South Carolina and California in ten days\u2019 time. According to an aide, the campaign experienced a spike in volunteers on Wednesday after news of Sanders\u2019 hospitalization broke, pushing the phone call tally up to 1.3 million. The figure is not surprising given the frenzy of emotion among his supporters following his hospitalization. A number of Sanders partisans with significant social media followings downplayed the significance of the stent procedure and highlighted the speed of Sanders\u2019 recovery. And the campaign racked up 8,000 donations on Wednesday, according to co-chair, Rep. Ro Khanna of California. One of the donors was RoseAnn DeMoro, the former executive director of the National Nurses United union, and a prominent campaign supporter, who chipped in $100. \u201cIt was like a rallying cry. It was incredible,\u201d DeMoro said of the outpouring of support for Sanders. \u201cThat\u2019s the difference between having a movement as opposed to just a campaign.\u201d Sanders supporters, many of whom have lost faith in more conventional politicians, are famously passionate in their support for Sanders. The prospect that a health scare could damage his standing in the polls prompted so much renewed involvement due to supporters\u2019 belief that Sanders is uniquely equipped to defeat Trump and solve the country\u2019s problems, according to Jim Zogby, a pollster and top Sanders surrogate. \u201cPeople all of a sudden woke up and said, \u2018Bernie might not be in the mix \u2015 this can\u2019t be,\u2019\u201d said Zogby, who also runs the Arab American Institute. \u201cHe comes back to an invigorated campaign with a staff and a support base that has doubled down in their efforts to make this happen. Because they realize that for them \u2015 and for me \u2015 he\u2019s the critical choice.\u201d Calls for Sanders\u00a0to drop out of the race \u2015 however few they were in number \u2015 only riled up Sanders\u2019 supporters, many of whom already firmly believe that the established media and political classes will stop at nothing to prevent Sanders from winning. The Thursday release of \u201cRising Up,\u201d a five-minute video created by Matt Orfalea, a Sanders activist not affiliated with the campaign, added to the dramatic \u201cus versus them\u201d narrative that has long animated Bernie World. Orfalea\u2019s video, which many called an advertisement, showed numerous clips of pundits, reporters and comedians mocking Sanders on a series of topics, juxtaposed with footage of him doing the opposite \u2014\u00a0greeting supporters with a smile, listening sympathetically, speaking to crowds of diverse voters. The spot, which featured some of the do-it-yourself charm of the 2016 campaign, earned plaudits from prominent Democrats who are not supporting Sanders but are nonetheless sympathetic to claims of media bias against him. In just a few days, the video racked up over 6.3 million views on Twitter alone \u2015 far more than Sanders\u2019 first official campaign ad, which came out days earlier. \u201cIt\u2019s something that deeply resonates and it was released at the perfect moment, when Bernie needed it the most,\u201d Rebecca Katz, a progressive strategist who is not aligned with any presidential candidate, said of the video. \u201cIt\u2019s the kind of things voters don\u2019t just watch but also share.\u201d A question on the minds of some poll watchers is nonetheless how Sanders\u2019 heart attack affects the campaign of Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, 70, a fellow progressive who has surpassed Sanders in national and early primary-state polls. In a gesture of solidarity, Warren\u2019s campaign bought dinner on Wednesday for Sanders\u2019 staff at his campaign headquarters in Washington. The Warren campaign declined to comment for this story. But two prominent Warren supporters suggested that Sanders\u2019 continued presence in the race could only help her candidacy. Adam Green, a co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which has endorsed Warren, argued that the presence of another left candidate is mutually beneficial. It increases the legitimacy of their shared ideas, and is liable to dissuade super-rich donors from erecting a super PAC to take out either one of them, he posited. \u201cIf you knock one out, you help the other,\u201d Green said of such a scenario. \u201cAnd if you run ads hitting both of them, you just elevate them as the two most clear and transformational progressives.\u201d Murshed Zaheed, a partner at the progressive communications firm Megaphone Strategies who previously worked for former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), echoed Green\u2019s sentiments, likening it to a progressive race to the top. \u201cThere\u2019s no coincidence that both of them are smashing the neoliberals in this race in terms of fundraising,\u201d said Zaheed. \u201cCompetition makes each one better.\u201d",

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) brushed off claims that his presidential campaign wasn\u2019t being transparent when the presidential hopeful was hospitalized after suffering a heart attack. \u201cThat\u2019s nonsense,\u201d Sanders, 78, said of the criticism, according to NBC News. \u201cI don\u2019t know what people think campaigns are. You know we\u2019re dealing with all kinds of doctors, and we wanted to have a sense of what the hell was going on, really.\u201d Sanders said his campaign acted \u201cabsolutely appropriately\u201d by not rushing to alert the media after he was hospitalized. \u201cSo the first thing that we\u2019re trying to do is understand what\u2019s going on and not run to The New York Times and have to report every 15 minutes,\u201d he told reporters Tuesday. \u201cYou know, this is not a baseball game. So I think we acted absolutely appropriately.\u201d When the Sanders campaign announced that the senator was hospitalized last week, they didn\u2019t specify Sanders\u2019 exact condition. The campaign noted only that Sanders had\u00a0\u201cexperienced some chest discomfort\u201d and underwent an emergency heart procedure for a blocked artery. Two and a half days later, Sanders was released from the hospital. At that time, his campaign issued a statement in which his doctors revealed he had a myocardial infarction, commonly known as a heart attack. The episode has thrust Sanders\u2019 health into the spotlight as one of the oldest candidates running for president. Critics have raised questions about whether he should campaign aggressively, but his staffers remain energized to move forward. Before his heart attack, the senator promised to release his medical records before the Democratic primaries begin. He told reporters Wednesday that he would release those records \u201cat the appropriate time,\u201d according to Politico. Sanders also said he had no intention of slowing down his campaign. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get back into the groove of a very vigorous campaign,\u201d Sanders said Tuesday. \u201cI love doing rallies, and I love doing town meetings.\u201d",

            "content": "ALTOONA, Iowa \u2015 Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a leading candidate for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, got a warm welcome at a gathering of the United Food and Commercial Workers union at a casino in this Des Moines suburb. The International President of the UFCW, Marc Perrone, praised him as a \u201cliberal lion\u201d who had changed the debate on health care and economic policy. At the end of Sanders\u2019 speech, the roughly 400 union members stood and applauded. There was one problem, if you could call it that: Sanders wasn\u2019t in Altoona. While Democratic candidates major (former Vice President Joe Biden) and minor (Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet) had flown to Iowa for the event, Sanders appeared from the living room of his family home in Burlington, Vermont, and delivered his speech via Skype. As new polling suggests Sanders\u2019 heart attack may harm his chances to win the nomination, his campaign is working to project normalcy, even as Sanders remains at home under doctor\u2019s orders. Sanders is set to make his first public appearance outside of Vermont since the health scare on Tuesday night at the fourth Democratic presidential debate in the suburbs of Columbus, Ohio \u2015 an appearance his campaign hopes will quiet doubts about whether he can win the nomination. Sanders\u2019 speech at the UFCW forum was his standard fare: He promised \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d a $15 minimum wage, doubling union membership in his first term, and floated the possibility of making the work week shorter.\u00a0(Sanders\u2019 friendly welcome from the UFCW crowd wasn\u2019t a total surprise: The union represents his campaign staff.) \u201cYou\u2019ve proven no matter what may come, you\u2019ll never shrink from a righteous fight,\u201d Perrone said before Sanders spoke. \u201cYou\u2019ve had a cardiac event, and you still wanted to be here with us.\u201d Sanders has made himself available to reporters multiple times in the past week and sat for an interview with ABC News on Sunday, hoping to continue to get his campaign\u2019s message out, even if he\u2019s unable to travel to the early states. In a new HuffPost/YouGov survey, 88% of registered voters say they\u2019ve heard at least a little about Sanders having a heart attack. The news appears to have taken a toll on perceptions of his health \u2015 just 19% of voters say they believe he is in good enough physical condition to serve effectively as president for four years. By comparison, 43% believe former Vice President Joe Biden is in adequate health, with 53% saying the same of President Donald Trump and 66% of Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Views of the candidates\u2019 health are clearly, to some extent, motivated by politics: 85% of Republican and Republican-leaning voters consider Trump physically healthy enough to serve, while only a quarter of Democrats and Democratic-leaners say the same. But even those on Sanders\u2019 side of the aisle are expressing concerns. Just 28% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters say they think Sanders is in physical condition to serve effectively, compared to the 59% who say the same of Biden and the 81% who say the same of Warren. More broadly, a 56% majority of voters say they believe Sanders\u2019 age would make it difficult for him to serve effectively as president, with 44% saying the same of Biden, who was born the year after him. Only a third are similarly concerned about Trump\u2019s age. Warren, perhaps helped by the fact that many voters believe her to be younger than she is, fared best on the metric, with just 16% saying her age would make it difficult for her to serve. It\u2019s not yet clear whether or to what extent these concerns will eat into Sanders\u2019 standing in the horse race, which has remained relatively stable in aggregate for months. Polling that focuses specifically on the candidates\u2019 age may overstate the degree to which voters are making their decisions on that basis. The electorate may not be pining for a septuagenarian president \u2015 just 3% of Democrats say they\u2019d consider that ideal, per one survey \u2015 but that hasn\u2019t stopped them from advancing a trio of candidates in their 70s to front-runner status against an incumbent of similar age. There\u2019s also potential room for specific worries about a candidate\u2019s health to recede. In a 2016 Economist/YouGov poll taken after Hillary Clinton suffered a bout with pneumonia, only 45% of voters thought she was in physical condition to serve as president; within two weeks, however, that number had recovered to 52%, close to where she\u2019d stood earlier in the campaign. (That same poll put confidence in Trump\u2019s physical health in the mid-60s, significantly better than his current standing.) Voters say, 64% to 22%, that it\u2019s fair for the media to question a candidate\u2019s physical health. They\u2019re more divided on how much information candidates should be expected to provide about their health. About half say candidates should publicly release all medical information that might affect their ability to serve, while 39% say the candidates should have the right to keep their records private. Democratic voters are more than twice as likely as GOP voters to say candidates should release all their medical information \u2015 a reversal from 2016, when Republicans were the party more likely to favor such disclosure and to consider media scrutiny fair game. Sanders\u2019 campaign maintains that he will demonstrate his vitality on national television when he participates in Tuesday\u2019s presidential debate in Westerville, Ohio. It is his first public appearance since the Oct. 1 hospitalization. On the debate stage, said campaign spokesman Mike Casca, voters will see a \u201creinvigorated Bernie.\u201d \u201cHe will dispel any lingering concerns when he returns to his regular pace on the trail,\u201d Casca added. Sanders announced over the weekend that his first major campaign event since the heart attack will be a large \u201cBernie\u2019s Back\u201d rally on the East River waterfront in Queens, New York, on Saturday. The rally, held in the same city where Warren drew her largest crowd of the campaign, follows a rocky period for Sanders\u2019 as it has sought to quiet doubts about viability. Sanders, who has been recovering at his home in Burlington, Vermont, told a group of reporters staking out his home on Tuesday that he would likely be slowing the pace of his campaign by, among other things, holding fewer than three or four events a day. A day later, he said he had \u201cmisspoke\u201d and that he had no plans to decelerate the campaign. But the campaign has said that Sanders\u2019 error was tonal \u2015 implying that the campaign would be less intense \u2015 rather than substantively inaccurate. It has not taken back the part of his remarks where he said he would hold fewer daily events going forward. In response to a request for clarification from HuffPost, the campaign declined to detail the volume of Sanders\u2019 future events, but said that Sanders would be careful not to overextend himself. Indeed, Sanders and his aides often imply that adopting a lighter schedule would not affect the campaign\u2019s performance, since he previously had one of the most packed schedules of any of the Democratic candidates. \u201cNobody\u2019s run a more vigorous campaign than Sen. Sanders \u2015 often holding three or four rallies a day with town halls throughout \u2015 and he was doing it all with a partially blocked artery,\u201d Casca said. Sanders vowed in mid-September that he would release his full medical records well before the Iowa caucus on Feb. 3. He has reiterated that commitment in the wake of his heart attack. In a Sunday interview with ABC News\u2019 Jonathan Karl, he said merely that the campaign would be releasing them \u201cas soon as we can.\u201d In the meantime, Sanders has been putting out a steady stream of digital content from his Burlington home designed to showcase his health. On Friday, Sanders released a video on social media showing him hitting baseballs pitched by deputy campaign manager Ari Rabin-Havt. The clip quickly racked up more than 500,000 views on Twitter. And when Karl interviewed him on Sunday, he pitched to Sanders in the Vermont senator\u2019s backyard. Karl subsequently took a shot at Sanders\u2019 pitches. \u201cTrue \u2015 I got shelled by a 78-year-old guy who just had a heart attack,\u201d Karl wrote in an Instagram post capturing video of Sanders making contact on Karl\u2019s pitch. \u201cBut check out Sanders on the mound.\u201d The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Oct. 8-10 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov\u2019s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population. HuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls. You can learn more about this project and take part in YouGov\u2019s nationally representative opinion polling.

            "author": "Rebecca Klein",
            "content": " A new filing in a lawsuit against the Trump administration accuses Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos and a top deputy of being motivated in part by sexism in their policy decisions. The lawsuit, originally filed in January, challenged DeVos\u2019 elimination of Obama-era Title IX guidance on how sexual assault cases are handled on campus. But an amended complaint submitted Wednesday says that DeVos\u2019 decision was influenced by discriminatory and stereotyped views of women. DeVos scrapped the Title IX guidance in September 2017, issuing her own interim guidance on the subject. Her version\u00a0raised the standard of evidence used in campus sexual assault cases. At the time, DeVos said that the Obama administration\u2019s directive was an example of federal overreach. But plaintiffs in the filing say DeVos and her deputies had more nefarious motivations, and they use new Freedom of Information Act records as evidence. The records indicate that Department of Education leaders had solicited input from groups and academics who push inflated and widely discredited statistics regarding the prevalence of false rape allegations. A National Sexual Violence Resource Center study found that false reports account for only about 2 percent to 10 percent of such allegations, a range that it said was likely inflated. \u201cWhat you see is that this administration is buying into the sex stereotype that women and girls lie about these types of things, and they\u2019re making policy based on that view,\u201d\u00a0Karianne Jones, counsel for Democracy Forward Foundation, told HuffPost. Democracy Forward is representing the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, along with the National Women\u2019s Law Center, National Center for Youth Law and Equal Rights Advocates. According to the lawsuit, the records also show Candice Jackson, then acting head of the department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights, recommended a book to her staff, Unwanted Advances: Sexual Paranoia Comes to Campus\u00a0by academic Laura Kipnis. The book describes Obama\u2019s Title IX guidance as allowing women to seek legal recourse for \u201cawkward sexual experiences\u201d and then ask for protection from \u201csexual bogeymen,\u201d per the filing. A spokeswoman for the Department of Education wasn\u2019t able to comment on the specifics of pending litigation but pushed back on the lawsuit\u2019s assertions, noting that department leaders met with a wide range of stakeholders on the issue at the time. \u201cThis lawsuit is nothing more than a baseless, politically motivated attack on the Secretary,\u201d spokeswoman Elizabeth Hill said by email. \u201cShe and OCR staff met with a number of people on this important issue including survivors, falsely accused students, college presidents and university GCs and the message was very clear from all of them \u2014 we have to get this right on behalf of students and the current process isn\u2019t serving students well. \u201cThe Secretary is committed to Title IX reforms that will ensure survivors feel empowered to come forward, all students are afforded due process and universities have clear rules to follow.\u201d The lawsuit says that, although the department solicited the views of those who were critical of Obama\u2019s Title IX guidance, \u201cthe Department met with organizations that advocate for Title IX\u2019s protections for survivors only after repeated, collective requests from those organizations.\u201d The FOIA records also show that Jackson had consulted with figures such as professor Gordon Finley of Florida International University on the issue. Finley is a member of the National Coalition for Men, a men\u2019s rights organization, and has referred to Obama\u2019s Title IX guidance as a \u201cwar on men.\u201d Records also show Jackson was in close contact with the group Families Advocating for Campus Equality, requesting they publish op-eds before a speech by DeVos, according to the lawsuit. The group was started by parents whose children had been accused of sexual assault on campus. DeVos previously publicly met with representatives of the National Coalition for Men and Families Advocating for Campus Equality. The plaintiffs in the case, which include groups like SurvJustice, Equal Rights Advocates and Victim Rights Law Center, say these documents, along with other statements and actions taken by DeVos and Jackson, show they had \u201cdiscriminatory motivation.\u201d An original lawsuit filed by the plaintiffs challenged the Trump administration\u2019s overall rescission of Obama\u2019s Title IX guidance. An overall challenge to the rescission was dismissed, with the judge saying you cannot challenge a nonbinding piece of guidance. But the amended complaint takes a different approach,\u00a0instead focusing on the mindset of administration officials. At the time DeVos rescinded the guidance, she said the old process lacked due process.\u00a0A report from the Wall Street Journal\u00a0on Wednesday says that DeVos is gearing up to release new rules on the matter, which will require that accused students be allowed to cross-examine their accusers and will narrow the definition of sexual assault cases that schools must arbitrate. Advocates worry that such a process will make victims more reluctant to come forward. The lawsuit mentions President Donald Trump\u2019s previous comments and behavior toward women, accusing him of sexism. Jackson previously said that 90 percent of sexual assault accusations are a result of drunken regrets or misunderstandings, a remark noted in the amended complaint and original lawsuit. At the time of the original lawsuit, a lawyer for the federal government said this did not prove intentional sexism on Jackson\u2019s part. CORRECTION:\u00a0A previous version of this story mischaracterized the guidance Betsy DeVos issued for campus sexual assault cases; her version raised, not lowered, the standard of evidence used.",

It didn\u2019t go well. According to Education Week, the proposal released earlier this month would gut at least 29 programs\u00a0in an attempt to save some $7 billion. \u201cWe had to make some difficult decisions with this budget,\u201d DeVos told a House subcommittee. \u201cMadam Secretary, I have to say, and maybe it\u2019s offensive: Shame on you,\u201d Rep.\u00a0Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) said per CNN. The suggested budget has little chance of making it into law; the Trump administration has proposed similar cuts in previous years that didn\u2019t pass when Republicans controlled the House.\u00a0With Democrats now holding the purse strings, it\u2019s even less likely to pass. But if the Special Olympics cuts were enacted,\u00a0more than 10 percent of the organization\u2019s revenue would be impacted. Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.) asked DeVos how many kids would be affected by the proposed Special Olympics cuts. DeVos said she didn\u2019t know. \u201cIt\u2019s 272,000 kids,\u201d he replied. DeVos admitted that the Special Olympics was an \u201cawesome organization\u201d but noted that it also received support from philanthropic groups. DeVos, a billionaire, even\u00a0donated a portion of her salary to the organization last year. More than two years ago, she met with Special Olympics athletes and shared this image on Twitter: This week, that old image received many new replies: You hurt people. Your life hurts people. DeVos pushed back on the negative public reactions to the budget proposal in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cThe Special Olympics is not a federal program,\u201d the statement said. \u201cIt\u2019s a private organization. I love its work, and I have personally supported its mission. Because of its important work, it is able to raise more than $100 million every year. There are dozens of worthy nonprofits that support students and adults with disabilities that don\u2019t get a dime of federal grant money.\u201d This story has been updated with a statement from Betsy DeVos.",

            "content": " Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos will reportedly make a major announcement this Thursday regarding the department\u2019s stance on Title IX. According to BuzzFeed\u2019s Tyler Kingkade, DeVos will reportedly speak about the college campus gender equality policy that\u2019s \u201ccentered around equal opportunity and equal protection for all\u201d at George Mason University\u2019s Law School in Arlington, VA. Since DeVos\u00a0was confirmed in February,\u00a0many advocacy groups have raised concerns that the Secretary of Education would roll back Title IX guidelines. While\u00a0Title IX is best known as a broad tool for enforcing\u00a0equal treatment of female and male student athletes, it also offers\u00a0other important protections\u00a0in areas including sexual harassment, sexual assault, and protections for trans and parenting students.\u00a0In the past six months DeVos rescinded protections for transgender students\u00a0and made the investigation process for college sexual assault\u00a0less transparent, while also\u00a0threatening to cut resources and funding. One impactful directive on campus sexual violence is the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter, a comprehensive set of guidelines that clarifies what schools\u2019 responsibilities are under the law to enforce Title IX. According to BuzzFeed, insiders expect DeVos to discuss Obama-era policies on campus sexual violence such as the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter on Thursday, and potentially roll them back. Managing Director of End Rape on Campus Jess Davidson explained to HuffPost that if DeVos rescinds the Dear Colleague Letter, it will send a strong message to both survivors and universities. \u201cI\u2019m very concerned about what it means for the federal government\u2019s view on sexual assault, and their view on survivors, for them to possibly rescind a guidance that is critical in helping students understand what their own rights are,\u201d Davidson said. \u201cThat is a very bad leadership signal and I believe it would have a trickle-down effect to university presidents and to other community leaders. If the government doesn\u2019t think that this is important than why should they?\u201d The Dear Colleague Letter is essentially a reminder to universities and Title IX administrators that schools need to follow the Title IX law. Alexandra Brodsky, a civil rights attorney and co-founder of\u00a0anti-sexual violence organization KnowYourIX, told HuffPost that if DeVos were to rescind the letter it would not change the law. \u201cIf DeVos stands up on stage on Thursday and says that the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter is rescinded, the law hasn\u2019t changed at all. Survivors have the same rights, schools have the same responsibility,\u201d Brodsky said. Davidson and Brodsky agreed that rolling back the Dear Colleague Letter would simply make the campus sexual violence reporting process that much more confusing \u2015 for survivors\u00a0and\u00a0universities. \u201cIt helps students understand what their rights are,\u201d Davidson said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not just survivors who are really going to struggle with this. The people who use the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter the most \u2015 or are supposed to use it the most \u2015 are Title IX administrators, the people who are conducting these investigations on campuses across the country. It\u2019s going to be really hard for them to do their jobs effectively if they don\u2019t have this kind of guidance. Schools need more clarification, not less.\u201d In July,\u00a0DeVos met with three groups to discuss sexual violence\u00a0on college campuses in separate 90-minute roundtable discussions. The groups included survivors and advocates,\u00a0university representatives and attorneys, and \u2015 by far the most controversial \u2015\u00a0students who had been falsely accused of assault. Brodsky, who was at the July meeting, said that in those discussions with DeVos the overwhelming consensus from universities and legal representatives was that the department should not rescind the Dear Colleague Letter. Davidson, who was also in attendance at the July meetings, noted that most of the \u201cwrongfully accused\u201d advocates were from Men\u2019s Rights Activists (MRA) groups. These groups tend to believe that sexual violence is over-reported, and that false accusations happen more often than they actually do.\u00a0(According to research, 2 to 10 percent of reported rapes turn out to be false.) \u201cAmong communities that believe [survivors cry rape], I think they see rescinding the Dear Colleague Letter as a win because they believe that it will help prevent\u00a0kangaroo courts,\u201d Davidson said. The Dear Colleague Letter, however,\u00a0does include guidelines\u00a0to help both parties \u2015 the victim and the alleged attacker \u2015 navigate the reporting process fairly. \u201cA\u00a0lot of this conversation arranged around the Dear Colleague Letter is that it\u2019s a threat to the procedural rights of accused students,\u201d Brodsky noted. \u201cBut actually the Dear Colleague Letter and Title IX provide more robust protections than are available under the U.S. Constitution.\u201d On a more granular level, rescinding the Dear Colleague Letter would impact the ability of survivors to ensure their schools are following Title IX procedures. Davidson said that when she was a college student going through the Title IX process, she was able to access the Dear Colleague Letter online and hold her university accountable. \u201cI was able to very easily find the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter online, highlight the sections that were not being followed in my proceeding, and take it to the Title IX office and say, \u2018This is what you\u2019re not doing and it\u2019s wrong and I deserve a fairer process than this, in fact I\u2019m guaranteed it under Title IX,\u2019\u201d she told HuffPost. \u201cIf we rescind the guidance it makes it harder for students to do that. It makes it harder for students to stand up for their own civil rights and to know their own civil rights.\u201d",

            "content": " One of US ed sec Betsy DeVos\u2019 preferred phrases is \u201clet me be clear.\u201d She has used the phrase in numerous speeches/public responses (see here and here and here and here). However, I wonder what DeVos would say if she actually decided to be clear concerning her motivations in promoting two stock DeVosian ideas: 1) decision making *left to the states* and 2) hyperindividualism in school choice (i.e., that an education \u201csystem\u201d is somehow a falsehood, an artifact of centuries past, or somehow in conflict with what is \u201cbest for each child\u201d). What if Betsy allowed America\u2019s middle class behind the veil of her public words? How would such a speech read? Below is my take on that very idea: Clear Betsy. Without further ado, let the dance between fiction and reality begin. *** First of all, I\u2019d like to thank all of you for coming because I appreciate yet another opportunity to campaign in a manner that ultimately promotes my favorite minority, the one to which I belong: America\u2019s elite among elite, those possessing the top .1% in American net worth. One way to understand my elitist motivations is to study the history and positions of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC). Of course, I would have preferred that ALEC be kept from public awareness, which it was for almost four decades. However, the unfortunate truth is that those without the interests of corporate America in mind destroyed that beautiful ALEC secrecy in 2012. The ALEC end game is to supplant federal control over states with corporate control. We prefer to promote this idea as federalism, or state control. The reality is states are ripe for control, and that control might as well come from moneyed interests\u2013 the .1%\u2013 rather than the federal government. The beauty in promoting \u201cstate control\u201d is that those outside of the top .1% (or, let\u2019s be generous, outside of the top 1%) hear the term \u201cstate control\u201d and equate it with \u201clocal control.\u201d Though I occasionally mention local control, I do not ultimately advocate for local control. You will not hear me give a speech in which I advocate replacing state control with local control. Local control is too close to you people, and, as such, corporate interests become more difficult to serve because it is the state legislators (and therefore, statehouses) that ALEC corporations control, not usually the local politicians. Besides, we lose the ability to hide our ALEC intentions behind federal scapegoating if we do not center our pseudo-local arguments on state control, and the best way to fool the public is to divert attention from the corporate control we desire by actively campaigning for federal control over states as the ultimate problem. On the food truck of state control, local control is the condiments.  I know about food trucks because I have seen them, and I have seen the condiments, as well. As for my constant focus on the individual when it comes to school choice: Such a diversion is necessary in order to keep you people from forming and relying upon collectives. Anyone outside of the .1% does not stand a chance against us individually; we can bulldoze such outsiders easily via our vast financial resources. But when you people join together and pool your resources, well, that presents more of a problem. Not only do you begin to challenge us via your resources (one of which constitutes your very selves as a work force for our beloved corporations); your numbers draw attention to issues, attention that frankly slides the veil just a shade too far back from our self-serving motives. That is why I hate unions. Now, it does not serve me to state so directly, so I instead prefer to appeal to the ideal of American individualism\u2013 an ideal, as I already mentioned, easily subdued. As easy as leading one sheep away from the flock and into a dark wood in which one wolf awaits. The single sheep who believes that one-on-one with a single wolf makes a fair match comes to a similar end as the single middle-class worker who believes his individuality equips him to effectively negotiate the terms of his employment with a single corporate magnate. An individual worker who does not know his place can be replaced with little to no interference in production. Though the sheep-wolf analogy breaks down if one considers that an entire flock of sheep poses no threat to a single wolf, a collective of middle class workers can pose a threat to corporate power\u2013 thus the need to fragment middle-class (and lower-class, for that matter) unity. The same lack of individual power holds true of school choice. Break up the collective by first convincing parents that their individual voices drive school choice. In reality, the so-called \u201cempowered\u201d parent has no power to make a school work for his or her child. However, convincing parents to Look Out for Number One, in turn, destabilizes the financial well-being of the community school (which I like to call outdated, just to push parents even further along the hyper-individualistic path), which, in turn, ideally leads to the freeing up of all of that public money to end up where it should be: under private sector control. Once the money hits the private sector, it becomes easier to funnel upward, and as that money makes its sure way into the bank accounts of corporate America, the power of the .1% is strengthened regardless of the state of the American economy, with you people increasingly dependent upon us. That is, if we can continue to successfully cripple that collective. So, now you know the truth of it all. I think I can safely speak for ALEC in general when I say it is nothing personal, just the right of privilege. If you were in my place, I\u2019m sure you would understand. Thank you; enjoy your food trucks, and God bless corporate America. *** Originally posted 10-21-17 at deutsch29.wordpress.com. ***",

            "content": " A Democratic congresswoman is demanding that Education Secretary Betsy DeVos step down, accusing her of supporting race-based punishment of students in light of her push to end an Obama administration policy on fair treatment for minorities in the classroom. \u201cI am calling for her resignation because she has failed to live up to her basic job responsibilities of making sure that our kids have fair and equitable access to a great public education and to keep them safe,\u201d\u00a0Rep. Katherine Clark (D-Mass.) told MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d on Monday. \u201cWhat Betsy DeVos did that I so object to and find disgusting is she rescinded civil rights policy and cherry-picked racist research to back it up.\u201d In December, the Trump administration scrapped guidance intended to shield students from racist discipline at school shortly after DeVos recommended the move. In doing so, DeVos cited a Journal of Criminal Justice study that argued that \u201cthe use of suspensions by teachers and administrators may not have been as racially biased as some scholars have argued.\u201d The study also claimed that \u201cthe racial gap in suspensions was completely accounted for by a measure of the prior problem behavior of the student.\u201d According to U.S. News & World Report, the findings stated that differences in suspension rates across racial groups \u201cappear to be a function of differences in problem behaviors that emerge early in life, that remain relatively stable over time, and that materialize in the classroom.\u201d Clark called out DeVos\u2019 use of the research as an indication that she had failed \u201cto stick up for children\u201d and was therefore \u201cunfit to carry on this job.\u201d The congresswoman denounced DeVos\u2019 use of the research, which she contended was an effort to portray behavioral issues as a matter of \u201cwho these children are\u201d in terms of race. Responding to Clark\u2019s criticisms, Department of Education press secretary Liz Hill emailed the following statement on Tuesday: The Secretary rescinded this guidance months ago because she heard repeatedly that it wasn\u2019t working for students or for teachers.\u00a0For the Congresswoman to show up and try to grab headlines is nothing more than political opportunism at its worst. Secretary DeVos always has and always will fight to make sure every student is treated like an individual and has the opportunity to learn and grow in an environment that is safe and nurturing. DeVos came under fire last month for advocating for the end of federal funding for the Special Olympics, but her proposal was later dismissed by President Donald Trump, who said he told his \u201cpeople\u201d to keep it in the administration\u2019s budget proposal.

The SeaQuest\u2019s captain said his crew awoke Sunday to find the boat had been untied from its mooring at the Huron Boat Basin and was floating away, according to a police report obtained by HuffPost. The crew was\u00a0\u201cable to gain control of the ship, but not before it struck the dock with its Starboard forward section,\u201d the police report stated.\u00a0Damage to the yacht consisted of \u201cseveral large scratches and scrapes,\u201d which the captain estimated would cost between $5,000 and $10,000 to repair, according to the police report. Huron City Police Chief Robert Lippert confirmed to HuffPost that the yacht belonged to the DeVos family. He said DeVos had not been aboard at the time,\u00a0but could not confirm whether other family members had been. Representatives for DeVos and her family did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u2019s requests for comment. Lippert would not speculate on a potential motive, citing the ongoing investigation.

            "content": " Opponents of school choice policies are akin to \u201cflat-earthers\u201d who are fighting innovation in education, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos said Monday night. DeVos gave a speech praising President Donald Trump\u2019s plans for the \u201cmost ambitious expansion of education choice in our nation\u2019s history \u2015\u00a0a day before his administration released a budget proposal that would slash Education Department funding by more than $9 billion. \u201cThe time has expired for \u2018reform.\u2019 We need a transformation \u2015 a transformation that will open up America\u2019s closed and antiquated education system,\u201d DeVos said\u00a0at the American Federation for Children\u2019s annual National Policy Summit in Indianapolis. \u201cDefenders of our current system have been regularly resistant to any meaningful change. In resisting, these \u2018flat-earthers\u2019 have chilled creativity and stopped American kids from competing at the highest levels.\u201d DeVos chaired the AFC, which advocates for school choice, before Trump nominated her to lead the Department of Education. She also suggested that refusal to embrace school choice was like hanging on to your flip phone in the age of smartphones and said that she wanted to \u201cdrag American education out of the Stone Age.\u201d DeVos likely used the term \u201cflat-earthers\u201d to refer to people who believe in an outdated, discredited theory, but she has faced criticism for her support of religious education, which in some institutions undermines scientific theory. She has made significant donations to a Michigan private school that\u00a0taught creationism alongside evolution in science classes and has served on its board. A billionaire who has long been involved in education advocacy, DeVos has pushed for school choice and reforms that would benefit parochial and private schools. School choice policies include expanding charter schools and voucher programs that let students use the public dollars allocated for their schooling to enroll in different districts or in charter or private schools. DeVos believes these policies give kids more opportunities and access to better schools. Critics see school choice as kneecapping public education, particularly poorer school districts and their students. Trump\u2019s 2018 budget, released Tuesday, calls for a 13 percent decrease in funding for the Education Department and major changes to student loan programs. For K-12 education, it would actually increase funding for school choice initiatives, adding $1 billion in grants for school districts, $167 million for a charter school program and $250 million for a program that gives low-income families scholarships for private and parochial schools. The cuts will hit various programs that enjoy broad bipartisan support, The Atlantic noted, including state grants for career and technical education and the federal work-study program. A $2.3 billion program that supports professional development and class-size reduction would be eliminated, as would $1.2 billion in grants for after-school and summer school programs used by nearly 2 million students. DeVos said in a statement that the budget \u201cmakes an historic investment in America\u2019s students\u201d and gives states and parents more decision-making power. She explained away the cuts as \u201ctough choices we have had to make when assessing the best use of taxpayer money\u201d and said the administration is \u201ctaking a hard look at programs that sound nice but simply haven\u2019t yielded the desired outcomes.\u201d The budget is only a proposal and needs approval by Congress, where it will face steep opposition. But the potential cuts have appalled education advocates. The \u201cshortsighted and cruel proposal\u201d is \u201can assault on the American Dream,\u201d said John King, president of the Education Trust and former education secretary under President Barack Obama. It \u201cwould make the climb to success much steeper for all our young people, especially students of color and students from low-income families,\u201d King said.",

            "content": " The U.S. Department of Education under Secretary Betsy DeVos this week began the process of dismantling the rules issued under President Obama to constrain the predatory abuses of for-profit colleges. At the end of the troubling first day of what\u2019s called negotiated rule-making, members of the public were given an opportunity to speak.\u00a0 I was the only person to get up to speak.\u00a0I said this: This proceeding is blocking a regulation that was carefully considered and carefully crafted to protect students and taxpayers from predatory college abuses. What the department now is doing is a bad idea, and I have submitted public comments explaining why I believe that. But that\u2019s the Washington, D.C. perspective on what\u2019s going on here \u2015 injury to a rule. From the perspective of those hard working Americans who have been defrauded and abused by for-profit colleges \u2015 veterans, single mothers, immigrants, the forgotten Americans whom President Trump promised to fight for \u2015 this proceeding, and this department\u2019s failure to act on 99,000 pending applications for relief, is about something much more urgent. Almost all the students seeking relief attended for-profit colleges. Many were left with useless credits and degrees from high-priced, low-quality programs. They were deceived into enrolling and left without the careers or salaries they were promised. Many nonetheless faithfully pay down their student loans every month, even if that leaves them with little money for rent, food, clothes for their children. This proceeding, and the delay in acting on claims, is causing immense hardship and heartbreak for those Americans. My colleagues and I know these men and women. They\u2019re good people. All they wanted was a chance to pursue their dreams and make better lives for their families. They\u2019re not asking, as Secretary DeVos recently suggested, for \u201cfree money,\u201donly to have some of their debts cancelled, so they have some chance for a future. But instead of standing with them, Secretary DeVos and this department are now standing with the people who have caused the harm, the people who have pocketed billions and required taxpayer bailout after taxpayer bailout. There is no sound public policy rationale for delaying and rewriting the borrower defense rule. The rule would quickly start saving money for taxpayers, by pushing the department to remove from federal aid those predatory schools that produce widespread loan defaults. But the issue papers prepared by the department for this meeting reveal its determination to cancel legitimate protections for students and taxpayers. I know and respect some owners and executives of for-profit schools. Some really do want the best for their students. The industry has many good teachers. Some owners expressed legitimate concerns during past rule makings. But over eight years of the last administration, the department took those concerns into consideration, and I believe we ended up with rules and policies that are more than fair to schools, rules that penalize bad actors while rewarding colleges that actually help students train for careers. This process today is, instead, about the corruption of our system. It\u2019s about the blatant desire of some for-profit colleges, which are associated with political appointees, donors, and friends of this administration, to go back to the recent bad old days, when they could act with impunity \u2015 deceiving and abusing students in order to maximize profits. Their misconduct, which has led to scores of federal and state law enforcement actions, and is still very much ongoing, has been a national scandal. And this proceeding extends and embodies that scandal. State attorneys general \u2015 Republicans and Democrats \u2015 will continue to fight against for-profit college fraud. Responsible Members of Congress, media outlets, and advocates for students and veterans will continue to expose abuses, and more prospective students will get the truth about bad actors in this industry, even if your department continues to weaken enforcement efforts, relax oversight of accreditors, approve sham conversions to non-profit status, and gut accountability rules. The department will be on the wrong side of history, the wrong side of justice and the wrong side of our people. Keep the existing borrower rule. Help these students.

Eighth-grader Torin Hodgman wore a transgender pride flag as a cape during DeVos\u2019 Tuesday appearance at the Grand Rapids Public Museum School in Grand Rapids, Michigan. The 14-year-old Hodgman, who identifies as genderqueer and prefers the pronouns \u201cthey\u201d and \u201ctheir,\u201d\u00a0can be seen walking alongside DeVos in the above MLive video.\u00a0DeVos interacted with students, who presented a series of science and environmental projects. She did not appear to acknowledge Hodgman\u2019s ensemble. Hodgman said they had planned to ask DeVos about school safety for LGBTQ youths during a morning roundtable.\u00a0While they didn\u2019t get a chance to do that, Hodgman hopes she recognized the flag. \u201cPublic schools are a place for all children,\u201d\u00a0Hodgman told MLive. The student\u2019s concerns are certainly justified. About a month into President Donald Trump\u2019s tenure, the Department of Justice and Department of Education\u00a0rescinded Obama-era guidance\u00a0that schools should allow trans students to use bathrooms, locker rooms and other school facilities that align with their gender identity.

            "content": "The U.S. Department of Education has angered women\u2019s rights advocates by proposing an overhaul of Title IX, the landmark law that has been used since the 1980s to hold schools accountable for preventing and responding to sexual violence against students. The proposed changes would strip away many protections against sexual violence that students have under Title IX. Now these protections are under threat not just for college students, but for child victims in K-12 schools, too. While Title IX was intended to protect equal access to education for women and girls, it also protects the men and boys who experience the terrible consequences of sexual violence in schools, from kindergarten through college. To strip them of even these bare protections of the law does no service to boys and men. One in 6 men in America is a survivor of sexual assault or abuse, and 1 in 20 boys is a victim of sexual abuse. In 2017 data covering the hundreds of thousands of child abuse cases handled by the nation\u2019s 854 Children\u2019s Advocacy Centers that year, 24 percent of perpetrators were cited as an \u201cother known person,\u201d like a neighbor or doctor. Or a classmate, teacher or coach. The proposed new rules would make it harder to prevent that abuse from happening and harder to hold schools and perpetrators accountable when it does. They would ignore the \u201clow-level\u201d sexual misconduct like inappropriate comments or groping that research tells us is a precursor to child sexual abuse. They would also create safe spaces for abusers by limiting schools\u2019 responsibility to address sexual assaults that happen off-campus, even when a child is assaulted by a classmate or teacher. They would even interfere in the neutral, fact-finding investigative process by subjecting child victims to cross-examination by their abusers, ensuring that the process of seeking justice and support services is as traumatic as possible and discouraging victims from coming forward. The agony of male survivors stalks the halls of the schools we attended as children. It lurks in the locker rooms where we went to football camp. It haunts classrooms where after-school tutorials turned to abuse. It infests the margins of our memories, crowding out the boyhood joys of scouting, of learning or of sports with private pain. That old poison, sexual abuse, leads men and women to despair, depression, drinking and even early death. The first course of the antidote to this poison is belief\u00a0\u2014 belief in the victims of sexual violence, the acknowledgment of their bravery, and the understanding that they risk so much, and often stand to gain so little, by telling what has happened to them. The cultural conversation that peaked during the Brett Kavanaugh confirmation fight incorrectly pitted men against women and pitted victims of sexual violence against those who, for whatever reason, believe they may one day stand wrongfully accused. Yet false sexual assault claims are no more common than false reports of other crimes, estimated at 2-10 percent of all reported assaults \u2014 and most assaults go unreported. A countermovement arose based on the false premise that false sexual assault claims, which are vanishingly rare, are commonplace. Now, the misinformation and fear-mongering of the #HimToo movement, which frightened parents and school leaders, has metastasized into a harmful federal policy. This misguided policy shift focuses on the extremely rare instances of young men being falsely accused, rather than on the heartbreakingly common experiences of children and adults who disclose experiences of sexual violence with the virtual guarantee that someone important to them won\u2019t believe them or will add to their trauma. Survivors need belief. Their healing begins with the words: I believe you. The countervailing disbelief is at the heart of these heartless Title IX changes. Another thing survivors need is a fair chance at getting justice and support services when something bad happens to them at school. Is the Department of Education really concerned that there\u2019s too little sexual assault in our schools, or that it\u2019s too easy for children to find a school leader who believes them and will do the right thing? This, in an era when institutions of all kinds are discovering there\u2019s hell to pay for ignoring the truth? When as many as one-quarter of college women are sexually assaulted while in school? Twenty million men\u00a0\u2014 and many, many more women and non-binary people \u2014 have been victimized by sexual violence. They don\u2019t need fewer protections. They need more. Keeping these protections for our nation\u2019s schoolchildren in place is our collective responsibility, and I encourage individuals and institutions to submit comments opposing the rule changes before the Jan. 28 deadline. But in particular, I appeal to the parents who are so worried about their sons facing false accusations that they are in favor of throwing out these victim protections. I can empathize with the many parents who have kept themselves up at night with this question: Who will believe my son if he\u2019s accused? Yet if we ignore the crisis of sexual abuse and assault in our schools, we must be prepared to ask ourselves the more tragic question: Who will believe my son if he\u2019s the one who gets hurt? Blake Warenik serves as director of communications at National Children\u2019s Alliance, the nation\u2019s largest network of care centers for child victims of abuse. CORRECTION:\u00a0A previous version of this story misstated the deadline for submitting comments opposing the rule change. It is Jan. 28, not Jan. 29.",

            "content": " Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who sparked a firestorm last week when she said it was a\u00a0school\u2019s choice to call Immigration and Customs Enforcement to report potentially undocumented students, changed her tune Tuesday, telling a Senate subcommittee she doesn\u2019t think schools can call ICE on undocumented students. DeVos\u2019 reversal came during a tense exchange with Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), who demanded that DeVos give a yes or no answer to whether the law allows this. DeVos first told Murphy that the 1982 Supreme Court decision in Plyler v. Doe \u201csays students that are not documented have the right to an education.\u201d When pressed for clarification, DeVos said she thinks \u201ca school is a sacrosanct place for students to be able to learn, and they should be protected there.\u201d Murphy accused DeVos of ducking the question. \u201cI think educators know in their hearts that they need to ensure that students have a safe place to learn,\u201d DeVos responded. Finally, after multiple rounds of prodding and Murphy\u2019s question,\u00a0\u201cSo they can\u2019t call ICE?\u201d DeVos responded:\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t think they can.\u201d Democratic members of Congress and civil rights groups have been demanding that DeVos correct her original comments since she made them. A week ago, in an exchange with Rep.\u00a0Adriano Espaillat (D-N.Y.) while testifying before the House Education and the Workforce Committee, DeVos said she thinks it\u2019s \u201ca school decision, it\u2019s a local community decision\u201d whether school leaders should call ICE on undocumented students or families. The Education Department subsequently said DeVos believes that schools should follow the principles established by Plyler v. Doe, which requires public schools to educate all students. Many critics of the education secretary, however, demanded a more public correction.\u00a0By Monday,\u00a0over 100 members of Congress had signed a letter reiterating the need for a \u201cswift, decisive, and widely disseminated correction.\u201d Espaillat said Tuesday, after DeVos\u2019 appearance before the Senate subcommitee, that he doesn\u2019t believe her new statement goes far enough. \u2033I would like to see from her a more definitive answer, as opposed to \u2018I think,\u2019\u201d Espaillat told HuffPost. \u201cI think is in the right direction, but it\u2019s not a definitive answer.\u201d Espaillat said he is \u201cperplexed\u201d that DeVos hasn\u2019t clarified the issue. \u201cThis only lends itself to people feeling afraid or skeptical about things and it doesn\u2019t help matters,\u201d said Espaillat. \u201dWe would like to have a definitive answer, and it should be more along the lines of, this is what the law says, therefore they cannot do it.\u201d ",

            "content": " Education Secretary Betsy DeVos met with a group of civil rights leaders, parents and teachers Wednesday morning to discuss the impact of Obama-era guidance that calls on schools to reduce their reliance on suspensions and to consider whether racial bias plays a role in their disciplinary practices. The examination of this guidance is part of DeVos\u2019 work as leader of a new Federal Commission on School Safety, although she has reportedly been thinking for months about rescinding the guidance. Wednesday\u2019s meeting,\u00a0which took place on the 50th anniversary of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., involved leaders in some of the country\u2019s most prominent civil rights groups, including the NAACP\u2019s Legal Defense Fund, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights and the Lawyer\u2019s Committee for Civil Rights Under Law \u2015 all of which are strongly in favor of keeping the guidance. Other participants included leaders from the nation\u2019s largest teachers union, the National Education Association, as well as teachers from the advocacy group Educators for Excellence and education researchers. Later on Wednesday, DeVos also met with groups, parents and teachers who want to see the guidance repealed. Liz King, senior policy analyst and director of education policy for the Leadership Conference, described the morning meeting as \u201cfrustrating and underwhelming.\u201d King spoke directly to Education Department officials about how this administration\u2019s actions are having a negative impact on school climate, especially for LGBTQ and immigrant students. She urged DeVos to maintain the existing guidance. \u201cOur children deserve better than this administration,\u201d said King, who described DeVos as \u201cvery pleasant,\u201d although \u201cshe didn\u2019t say much.\u201d Evan Stone, co-CEO of Educators for Excellence, left the meeting with a more positive view, although he still suspects advocates of the guidance are fighting an \u201cuphill battle.\u201d He was heartened that DeVos opened the meeting by acknowledging the large racial disparities in how students are disciplined. DeVos said she was moved by the stories from educators in the room, according to Stone. Stone\u2019s group requested that DeVos come visit some of the communities that have had positive experiences with the Obama-era guidance. \u201cHopefully the lived experience of teachers who are working to change things will have an impact,\u201d\u00a0he said. In a country where students of color, students with disabilities and LGBTQ students are disproportionately subject to harsh disciplinary practices, like suspensions and expulsions, the guidance is seen as a tool to help reduce the flow of students who are pushed from school into the criminal justice system. The guidance warns schools that they could be found in violation of federal civil rights laws if they are disciplining some groups of students \u2015 like students of color or students with disabilities \u2015 at disproportionately high rates. It also encourages schools to adopt restorative justice practices as a way to deal with discipline issues,\u00a0rather than punishments that push kids out of the classroom. On the other side of the issue, critics say the guidance helps keep disruptive children in the classroom, putting teachers and students at risk. The guidance came under renewed scrutiny after the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, in February, when conservative leaders speculated that lax discipline policies allowed the accused shooter\u2019s behavior to go unchecked. (The school\u2019s responses to the suspect\u2019s behavior appear entirely unrelated to the guidance. The Education Department had also started meeting with critics of the guidance months before the shooting.) But even before Wednesday\u2019s meetings began, DeVos faced critiques from the advocacy groups and civil rights organizations that had not been offered a seat at the table. Groups like the National Women\u2019s Law Center sent DeVos a letter\u00a0slamming what they called\u00a0\u201cthe exclusive and non-transparent approach\u201d of the summit. The letter was co-signed by groups like the Human Rights Campaign and the National Center for Transgender Equality. It expressed the groups\u2019 support for the guidance. A number of other groups asked to be included in Wednesday\u2019s discussion but did not receive an invitation. A representative from the National Disability Rights Network told HuffPost they asked the Education Department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights for an invitation last Friday, but the agency declined. The Council of Parent Attorneys and Advocates, a group that represents children with disabilities, also asked both the Education Department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights and its Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services for an invitation, but did not hear back. King said it was \u201cwas glaringly apparent there was no one from the disability community, the LGBTQ community, the Native American community, the Latino community, or the immigrant community in the room.\u201d Additionally, only one of the country\u2019s major teachers unions was invited, with the administration leaving out the American Federation of Teachers. \u201cI find it very offensive that they don\u2019t want to hear our opinions,\u201d AFT President Randi Weingarten told HuffPost. DeVos\u2019 meeting with critics of the guidance included groups like the Manhattan Institute, as well as parents and teachers who believe the guidance should be rescinded. (The Education Department did not respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for information about who would be present at this meeting.) Nicole Landers of Baltimore County is one such parent. She says the relaxed disciplinary practices at her kids\u2019 schools have come at the expense of student safety.\u00a0Landers\u2019 daughter was sexually harassed last year by another student when she was a fifth-grader. Her older son was bullied to the point where he became suicidal. Their tormentors, though, remained in the classroom, and she believes the Obama-era guidance helped make this situation possible. \u201cWhatever intentions were set forth in the guidance, the response to the guidance has been kind of knee-jerk in nature that has ended up hurting all of the children,\u201d Landers said. \u201cIt takes away the rights from the victimized students, as the offending students are left in the classroom to avoid suspensions.\u201d This is a developing story. Check back for updates.",

Instead, DeVos said the commission will study \u201cschool safety and how we can ensure our students are safe at school.\u201d Leahy asked DeVos if she thinks an 18-year-old should be able to buy AR-15-style guns and ammunition. \u201cI believe that\u2019s very much a matter for debate, and I know that\u2019s been debated within this body and will continue to be,\u201d DeVos replied. \u201cOur focus is on raising up successful proven techniques and approaches to ensuring schools are safe for students to attend.\u201d The White House charged DeVos with leading a federal commission on school safety after a shooting in Parkland, Florida, in February left 17 dead.

            "content": "Last week, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos released a proposed regulation on Title IX that would let schools off the hook for mishandling complaints of sexual violence. The phrase \u201ccollege sexual assault\u201d evokes nightmarish experiences in Ivy-covered dorm rooms and fraternity housing, and that\u2019s certainly where some of these assaults are perpetrated. But DeVos\u2019 proposed rule would also have devastating impacts on community college students, who make up 42 percent of all undergraduate students in the United States. The new rule would allow community colleges and other schools to disregard violence that occurs outside of their programs and activities, even when that violence interferes with a survivor\u2019s education. That means that schools wouldn\u2019t be required to investigate and provide support to a survivor who is assaulted in her off-campus apartment by a student from her biology class. This policy would have especially serious ramifications for community college students, many of whom do not live on campus or are enrolled part time. In fact, the college sexual assault crisis is particularly acute at commuter schools, where the environment around the immediate campus can be a high-risk area for sexual assault and stalking. In addition, the new policy would only require schools to investigate the most extreme forms of harassment and assault. It\u2019s possible that a student who is fearful of attending a class as their stalker waited for them outside the door wouldn\u2019t have rights under the changes proposed to Title IX. And as the American Civil Liberties Union notes, a school would only be required to act when the sexual violence or harassment completely denies a student access to education. This would constitute a significant rollback of survivors\u2019 rights: Right now, schools are expected to assist survivors when harassment interferes with or limits their access to education, for example, when a student is struggling to keep their grades up or is afraid to attend a class where their abuser is present. If DeVos gets her way, students would be forced to endure repeated and escalating levels of abuse without being able to ask their schools for help. So that student whose stalker waits for her outside class won\u2019t be eligible for support from her school if she drops the class, or drops out of school entirely. It\u2019s easy to see how the proposed rule sets up community college students for failure. By the time that the Department of Education would require a school to intervene, a survivor might have had to already drop a prerequisite course that would allow them to complete their degree or matriculate to a 4-year institution. And even if a survivor graduates or transfers, the trauma of their school\u2019s betrayal will linger. Experiencing institutional abuse can engender mistrust with subsequent academic institutions, and survivors may be less inclined to report at their new college. It gets worse. The Department of Education would also forbid schools from removing perpetrators from spaces they share with survivors while an investigation is ongoing. As a result, survivors will bear the brunt of withdrawing from classes for fear of encountering their abusers on a regular basis. This will hit survivors at community colleges especially hard, because for students at those schools, course flexibility \u2015 like night classes and part-time enrollment \u2015 is critical to balancing classes with employment, child care and other commitments. If a student cannot find a different time slot for a class they share with an abuser, they may be compelled either to withdraw or re-enroll in a different semester. And Title IX, a law intended to protect survivors of sexual violence, will have been the reason for their educational setbacks. Finally, DeVos\u2019 proposal would incentivize community colleges to make it harder, not easier, to report sexual assault. That\u2019s because under the proposed rule, the Department of Education will only find a school in violation of Title IX if their leadership had direct knowledge of the assault or harassment. This creates perverse incentives for schools to make it more difficult to report, and disincentivizes informing students of their rights. It\u2019s already hard enough for students to get accurate information about their rights on campuses and the services available to them if they\u2019re assaulted. When I arrived at my community college, the school provided only a short, general online training that barely scratched the surface of resources available on my campus. Throughout my time at the school, I did not know the identity of my Title IX Coordinator or how to report harassment \u2015 and I was the President of the Women\u2019s Student Association. When I escaped my abuser\u2019s physical and psychological harm, he cut off the financial resources that would have enabled me to attend a four-year college. Community college was my only option, so I enrolled in a two-year associate\u2019s degree program in New York. At that school, my friends experienced sexual violence akin to the much-publicized abuse at four-year institutions, and that abuse and institutional betrayal had severe consequences for my friends\u2019 educations. \u00a0But they were never greeted with the national outrage that was extended to survivors at schools like Columbia, an elite four-year school that\u2019s just a few miles away. Community colleges afford critical educational opportunities to survivors of sexual assault, and they\u2019re also rife with sexual violence and discrimination. And DeVos\u2019 proposed rules would only make things worse. Throughout her tenure as Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos has been all too willing to deregulate higher education at the direct expense of students. These new Title IX rules are no different. Instead of protecting the civil rights of community college students, DeVos has opted to dismantle Title IX\u2019s protections in favor of schools\u2019 bottom lines. For survivors at community colleges, the cost of the new rule may be their educations. The Department of Education is about to accept public comments on the proposed regulation. If you want to stand with survivors and prevent this rule from becoming law, you can join us here.

            "content": "Earlier this month, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos released newly proposed Title IX regulations regarding how schools should handle reports of sexual harassment and violence. When they are formally put into place, these guidelines will narrow the definition of sexual misconduct so fewer cases fall under Title IX\u2019s umbrella. It would also make schools responsible only for harassment or violence done on campus or at school-sanctioned events (so not at off-campus fraternity houses or apartments.), and restrict whom someone must report to at a college in order to initiate a formal investigation. And these new regulations would encourage a higher standard of evidence. Those most concerned about students who are accused of harassing or harming others are cheering what they see as a strengthening due process and the rights of the accused. Survivors and their advocates are concerned this will make it harder to report and so discourage people from doing so. Also, this is a financial advantage for universities who will have less legal liability (DeVos appears to care very much about protecting institutions over and above students.) As someone who has reported on campus sexual assault and sports over the last five years, it\u2019s hard for me not to read over these proposed regulations and think immediately about what this will all mean for college athletics. Anyone who cares about mitigating abuse and the enabling of it within collegiate athletic departments should be very worried. There is recent data that suggests student-athletes are more likely to be involved in Title IX cases than other students. You have to wonder what DeVos\u2019 changes mean specifically for student-athletes who are themselves victims of sexual harassment or violence at the hands of another student-athlete. Sports play such a large role on university campuses. Student athletics regularly involve huge amounts of money and they have their own media machine always looking for content. When the issue of campus sexual assault discussed, it is often when it involves a student-athlete. Think of Baylor, Minnesota, Michigan State, Tennessee, Florida State, Texas A&M, on and on. \u201cI meet at least three female survivors that have been raped by another athlete at every single school I go to,\u201d Brenda Tracy told me. Tracy, founder of Set The Expectation and a rape survivor whose attackers included Oregon State football players, spends much of her time visiting and speaking with sports administrators and student-athletes about changing the culture of departments and encouraging programs to work toward eradicating sexual harassment and violence. She believes these proposed guidelines will not foster \u201cany type of a culture for survivors so they can come forward and report,\u201d which will especially be true in athletic departments. A 2014 congressional report found that one-fifth of universities allowed their athletic departments to oversee cases that involved student-athletes. And this was under the Obama administration\u2019s guidelines, the ones that DeVos\u2019 administration and advocates for the accused thought went too far. At the time, Kate Fagan wrote a piece for espnW in which she talked about the specific problem in collegiate athletic departments: \u201cThat 20 percent number in the congressional report is chilling, as athletic departments (as well as colleges in general, of course) have competing interests,\u201d she wrote. \u201cYes, they\u2019re charged with protecting the welfare of student-athletes but also with protecting a very lucrative brand. Too often, their commitment to the former is sacrificed for a preservation of the latter.\u201d Now, when DeVos\u2019 proposed guidelines go into effect, it will mean less incentive for a commitment to protecting the welfare of student-athletes in the face of preserving the overall interests of an athletic department. That\u2019s cynical, sure, but it\u2019s backed up by a history that shows that programs fail to adequately implement Title IX when it comes providing equitable resources for women\u2019s sports (which is an extension of an overall culture within sport that cares less about female athletes) and when it comes to dealing with reports of sexual harassment or violence. \u201cIt\u2019s already hard enough for a female athlete to navigate the process,\u201d Tracy says. Athletic programs, she says, train athletes to think of it as a family. And so, \u201cEverything stays within athletics. If you have a problem in your class, you find a tutor in athletics. If you get a parking ticket, go to this person in athletics. So, it\u2019s already hard enough to report against another athlete, because you\u2019re basically betraying the family, right? You\u2019re causing a problem.\u201d Cody McDavis, a former Division I basketball player at the University of Northern Colorado and an advocate for survivors of sexual violence, told me these proposed regulations \u201ccompound on an issue of non-accountability in collegiate athletics\u201d by \u201cfurther insulat[ing] that non-accountability. There\u2019s an elephant in the room, but it\u2019s just being put under the carpet in a fairly obvious way.\u201d The NCAA doesn\u2019t care enough about this issue to do anything (they certainly didn\u2019t punish Michigan State). What they have done has no teeth. McDavis says sports needs to get this right, though. \u201cIt drives a lot of the cultural mores,\u201d he says, so sports \u201ccan be a beacon of a lot of good things, but they can also be one of a lot of bad things.\u201d If the Department of Education and the NCAA are not going to help mitigate sexual harassment and violence within athletic departments, what can someone do? Well, first, these are proposed regulations. The public can comment on them beginning on Nov. 29. End Rape on Campus and Know Your IX have partnered to create Hands Off IX that explains how to participate in the process. For sports specifically, McDavis has a petition \u201ccalling on the Power Five Conference Commissioners \u2014 the most influential conferences in the NCAA \u2014 to immediately ban student-athletes with a history of violence.\u201d Tracy says fans, alumni and donors should go directly to their schools and advocate for policies that protect the safety of the campus and of student-athletes. And the media has to keep reporting and we all have to keep sharing these stories. Universities might not like being legally liable but they might just hate bad PR more. No one wants to be the next Baylor or Ohio State or Michigan State. It\u2019s our job to tell them: So don\u2019t be.

Jackson, who now serves as second in command at the Department of Education\u2019s Office for Civil Rights, made these comments during a phone conversation in March with representatives from the Southern Poverty Law Center, a civil rights advocacy group.\u00a0At the time, Jackson was temporarily serving as the highest official in the Office for Civil Rights, an agency that enforces federal civil rights laws in schools. In the call with the SPLC, Jackson said much of the opposition to the guidance is based on misinformation and misperception, according to a letter the SPLC later sent to Jackson that documented these comments. The letter, which HuffPost has obtained, was an acknowledgment of the SPLC\u2019s meeting with Jackson, as well as a follow-up to some of the points discussed surrounding the guidance. On Tuesday, the SPLC sent another letter to Kenneth Marcus, who recently took over for Jackson as head of the Office for Civil Rights. The letter reiterates the comments Jackson made and urges Marcus to take the same position as his predecessor, \u201cthat rescinding the DOJ/ED Discipline Guidance is unnecessary and harmful.\u201d \u201cAssistant Secretary Marcus has an opportunity here to demonstrate a commitment to core American values,\u201d Zoe Savitsky, deputy legal director of SPLC, told HuffPost. In response to requests for comment about the meeting, Department of Education spokeswoman Elizabeth Hill said the fate of the guidance is still undecided and the administration is continuing to study the issue as part of the Federal Commission on School Safety. \u201cOCR has met with many advocacy groups with diverse opinions on this important issue. While those meetings continue, absolutely no decisions have been made,\u201d Hill said. In the past, Jackson has come under fire\u00a0for her comments\u00a0that most campus sexual assaults are a result of regrettable drunken hookups. The Obama-era guidance, released in 2014, clarified how schools should interpret federal civil rights laws to ensure they\u2019re not discriminating against students. The directive asked schools to taper their use of tough disciplinary tactics \u2015 like suspensions and expulsions \u2015 and warned schools that they could violate the law if certain groups of students are consistently receiving harsher punishments than others. The guidance was issued in reaction to stark statistics showing that students of color are disproportionately subject to harsher discipline than their white peers, even for the same behavior. The Department of Education continues to receive hundreds of legal complaints regarding discriminatory discipline in schools. In 2017, the department received over 200 complaints, HuffPost previously reported. However, the guidance has been sitting on the Trump administration\u2019s chopping block for months. As far back as November 2017, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos began meeting with critics of the directive. Then, in March, President Donald Trump asked DeVos to lead a Federal Commission on School Safety after the deadly school shooting in Parkland, Florida. Part of the school safety commission\u2019s mandate is to recommend policies surrounding the \u201cRepeal of the Obama Administration\u2019s \u2018Rethink School Discipline\u2019 policies.\u201d DeVos has held meetings with both critics and advocates of the guidance. Critics of the Obama directive say it has put pressure on teachers to keep misbehaving students in the classroom to maintain low suspension numbers, making schools less safe. Others say schools were not given the tools to implement alternatives to suspensions and expulsions, creating a more chaotic environment. But civil rights groups like the SPLC see the guidance as a key tool in helping to protect vulnerable students who are already disproportionately pushed out of school. During the March meeting, Jackson asked for more evidence to support what the SPLC letter calls \u201cthe fact that racial disparities in school discipline cannot be explained by differences in behavior by race\u201d and mentioned several districts where she heard the guidance might be negatively affecting students. Still,\u00a0with Jackson, the SPLC found a somewhat sympathetic ear. After noting how much misinformation surrounds the guidance, Jackson said the Education Department could \u201cprovide a more thorough explanation of the purpose and goals of the guidance.\u201d It is unclear where Marcus, the new head of the civil rights office, will land on this issue, although civil rights groups have expressed fear that he will promote rescission. They\u00a0ardently opposed his confirmation to the position. Tuesday\u2019s SPLC letter calls on him \u201cto protect vulnerable students and ensure that they are not harmed, either by the unnecessary and discriminatory use of exclusionary discipline or by any actions taken by the Department.\u201d",

            "content": "(Reuters) \u2015 U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos will issue new rules to colleges and universities for addressing sexual harassment or assault cases, lessening their liability for incidents that happen off-campus, the New York Times reported on Wednesday. The new policies would also strengthen the rights of students accused of assault, harassment or rape and seek to provide more support for victims, the Times reported. Department of Education spokeswoman Liz Hill declined to discuss the proposed recommendations with Reuters. \u201cWe are in the midst of a deliberative process. Any information the New York Times claims to have is premature and speculative, and therefore we have no comment,\u201d Hill said. The report was published on the same day that officials said a former University of Southern California (USC) gynecologist, George Tyndall, accused of sexually assaulting hundreds of students, had agreed to a suspension of his medical license. The Education Department is investigating how USC handled that case after the university acknowledged failing to properly act on at least eight complaints lodged against Tyndall between 2000 and 2014. Last year, the administration of Republican President Donald Trump reversed guidelines established under President Barack Obama, a Democrat, on how colleges should handle sexual assault accusations, saying the prior policies led to too many students being falsely charged or disciplined. The prior rules outlined a strict set of steps for schools to follow or risk losing funding under Title IX, the federal law that bars sex discrimination in education. According to the New York Times, the rules being prepared by DeVos\u2019 office would preserve much of Title IX but would also for the first time legally define sexual harassment on campuses and how schools were expected to address formal complaints. The proposals would hold colleges and universities responsible only for incidents on campus or in their programs and call for impartiality in investigating allegations and using the presumption that the accused student or staff member is innocent until proven guilty, the newspaper reported. \u201cThe proposed campus sexual misconduct policies from Betsy DeVos and her Department of Education are just the latest example of the Trump administration turning its back on women and victims of sexual assault,\u201d the Democratic National Committee said in a statement. \u201cThese proposed rules are a blatant and disturbing attack on every student who has experienced or could experience sexual assault or misconduct on a college campus, and they exemplify the misplaced priorities of DeVos and the Trump administration,\u201d the DNC said.

            "author": "Alanna Vagianos",
            "content": " Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos released her long-awaited proposed Title IX guidelines Friday morning, and there\u2019s a lot to unpack. The\u00a0proposed regulations essentially provide more protections for the accused and make it harder for survivors of sexual violence to report harassment and assault by narrowing the definition of sexual misconduct. Additionally, the guidelines essentially prioritize schools above all by creating fewer sexual misconduct cases, which reduces costs (saving colleges anywhere from $286 to $368 million over 10 years, according to estimates included in the proposed guideline). \u201cThe Trump Administration\u2019s proposed rule is designed to let schools off the hook for sexual assault and harassment,\u201d\u00a0Sage Carson, manager of the anti-sexual violence organization Know Your IX, said in a Friday morning statement. \u201cThese proposals signal the Department of Education\u2019s decision to prioritize schools\u2019 bottom line over survivors\u2019 right to an education,\u201d she continued. \u201cIf these draft rules become law, more survivors will be forced out of school by harassment, assault, and their schools\u2019 indifference to their complaints.\u201d Title IX,\u00a0the federal civil rights law created to ensure gender equality in education, applies to all schools that receive federal funding, including nearly all colleges and universities,\u00a0all public K-12 schools and a few private K-12 schools that receive federal dollars. The regulations differ slightly for K-12 schools versus college and university campuses. The suggested guidelines are similar to a copy\u00a0partially leaked in August\u00a0which faced swift criticism from survivor advocacy groups for making it harder for victims to report harassment and assault. Below are the provisions that could have the largest impact on how sexual misconduct is handled in school settings across the country: Keeping with the leaked copy, Friday\u2019s suggested guidelines narrow the definition of sexual misconduct, defining it as \u201cunwelcome conduct on the basis of sex that is so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to the recipient\u2019s education program or activity.\u201d Jess Davidson, executive director of survivor advocacy organization End Rape on Campus, described this portion of the regulations as \u201cone of the most harmful parts of the rule.\u201d \u201cThe definition is extreme and it\u2019s going to require that students are harassed multiple times before they are able to receive any form of accommodation,\u201d she told HuffPost. Under the proposed guideline, a school \u201cis only responsible for responding to conduct that occurs within its \u2018education program or activity.\u2019\u201d The Education Department loosely defines \u201ceducation program or activity\u201d as \u201call of the operations of\u201d a school including anything that has \u201cany academic, extracurricular, research, [or] occupational training.\u201d This definition, however, does not include off-campus housing or bars and other settings within a school environment where assault and misconduct often take place.\u00a0This is one of the most worrisome provisions of the entire 149-page proposal because\u00a087 percent of college students live off campus. Davidson noted that this provision could prove disastrous for marginalized students, specifically community college and commuter students who spend a majority of their time off-campus. Additionally, this would allow schools like Michigan State and Ohio State, both currently embroiled in sexual assault scandals, to sidestep misconduct perpetrated by staff at off-campus events. \u201cWould it make sense for Larry Nassar not to be held accountable if he only abused student athletes at off-campus events? It\u2019s absurd,\u201d\u00a0Sejal Singh, policy coordinator for Know Your IX, said to HuffPost in August. Under the proposed provisions, the accused can participate in a live cross-examination of the alleged victim through a third party (although this does not apply fully to K-12 incidents). Unlike the earlier leaked copy, Friday\u2019s proposed rule would not allow the accused to cross-examine their accuser personally. Additionally, the accuser is allowed to request that their alleged perpetrator watch the live cross-examination from a separate room which prohibits \u201cany unnecessary trauma that could arise from personal confrontation.\u201d This process, known as mediation, encourages schools to simply work it out themselves instead of following a regulated investigation protocol. \u201cBefore the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter (DCL), schools pushed survivors to \u2018work it out\u2019 with their rapists, fostering a climate where students were afraid to come forward\u201d\u00a0anti-sexual violence organization Know Your IX\u00a0said in a Friday statement.\u00a0\u201cThe Department\u2019s decision to revert back to a harmful status quo will allow for schools and rapists to intimidate survivors into silence.\u201d Additionally, the Education Department has not offered any guidelines on how this mediation process would potentially play out. The guidelines would restrict whom a victim can report to in order to implement corrective measures through the school. College students would only be able to report a Title IX issue with the school\u2019s Title IX coordinator which, Davidson said, is cause for concern. \u201cThe lived experience of most college students don\u2019t set them up to go first to the dean of students or to the Title IX administrator directly,\u201d she said. \u201cMost students want to talk to \u2015 as anybody does \u2015 students want to talk to a campus official or an adult who they trust, who will be on their side, who will affirm them, and will help them find safety and an answer.\u201d \u201cTo see this definition go forward \u2015 that would essentially give a free pass to OSU and Michigan State and Larry Nassar \u2015 is really horrifying,\u201d Davidson added. It\u2019s worth noting that mandatory reporting laws still apply, but for a student to receive help and protection from their school specifically, they would need to seek out a Title IX coordinator. This provision would not apply to students K-12. The proposed guidelines state a school can use \u201ceither the preponderance of the evidence standard or the clear and convincing evidence standard.\u201d Many survivor advocate groups, however, highlighted that using a \u201cclear and convincing\u201d standard would treat sexual misconduct survivors more harshly than victims of other discriminatory campus crimes. \u201cInstead of imposing discriminatory procedural hurdles for campus sexual harassment cases, schools should use the same standards that they use for other serious campus wrongdoing, such as physical assault or arson,\u201d Know Your IX noted. Many politicians and Title IX advocates were up in arms over the proposed guidelines.\u00a0Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney (D-N.Y.) urged Congress to stand against the proposal, writing that it \u201cseems intended to make college campuses safe spaces to commit sexual assault and harassment instead of safe spaces to learn.\u201d In a Friday statement, Sen.\u00a0Patty Murray (D-Wash.) called on \u201cevery woman, man, mom, dad, and anyone else who cares about campus safety and preventing sexual assault to make your voices heard and demand that Secretary DeVos and President Trump withdraw this proposal immediately.\u201d Lara Kaufmann, Director of Public Policy for Girls Inc., pointed out how damaging this proposal could be for K-12 girls specifically. \u201cAll girls should be able to grow up safe, respected, and valued,\u201d she said in a statement to HuffPost. \u201cUnfortunately, these new proposals will lead to fewer students reporting assaults and harassment, more dangerous K-12 schools, and more girls being denied their civil right to equal access to education.\u201d President of the American Federation of Teachers Randi Weingarten also condemned the proposed rules in a Friday statement. \u201cThis rule abdicates the responsibility to protect every student\u2019s right to safety on campus,\u201d she said. \u201cIt tells academic institutions that they needn\u2019t bother helping to protect students; they won\u2019t be liable. These changes once again demonstrate that students are not DeVos\u2019 priority.\u201d Since she was confirmed as Secretary of Education last year,\u00a0DeVos has been on a mission to overhaul the Obama-era Title IX guidelines and regulations. In 2017, DeVos met with people \u201cwrongly accused\u201d of sex crimes (a group consisting mainly of so-called men\u2019s rights activists) and, not long after, rescinded an Obama-era Title IX guideline,\u00a0The Dear Colleague Letter. \u201cIt\u2019s worth noting that the secretary has talked a lot about the importance of a fair process but that\u2019s not what this reads like to me,\u201d Davidson said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t somebody trying to create fairness in the process, this is somebody who is trying to prevent the process from taking place at all.\u201d Legally, the Education Department is required to consider all comments from the public\u00a0and publicly respond to criticism before making a decision.

Trump said the Turks needed to have a swath of Syria \u201ccleaned out\u201d after battling with Syrian Kurds there. Trump spoke after Turkey announced a five-day \u201cpause\u201d in fighting in Syria negotiated by Vice President Mike Pence. The deal was reached just over a week after Trump agreed in a phone call with Erdogan to pull out U.S. troops\u00a0in Syria to cede the battlefield to the Turks, who have targeted America\u2019s Kurdish allies. Pence has termed the new deal a \u201cceasefire,\u201d but the Turkish foreign minister called it a \u201cpause,\u201d emphasizing: \u201cThis is not a ceasefire,\u201d and said that Turkish troops would not withdraw. Turkey will pause its invasion for 120 hours to allow the Kurds to withdraw from a zone of the border region. But the agreement also allows Turkey to take over a significant swath of Syria and calls on Syrian Kurdish forces, known as the YPG, to surrender their heavy weapons. The deal would suspend U.S. economic sanctions against Turkey. \u201cFor many, many years, Turkey, in all fairness, they\u2019ve had a legitimate problem\u201d with northeast Syria, where the Kurds are settled, Trump said in remarks in Texas ahead of his rally in Dallas. \u201cThey had terrorists, they had a lot of people in there they couldn\u2019t have \u2026. and they had to have it cleaned out.\u201d (See the video above.) The Kurds have battled ISIS for years alongside U.S. troops \u2014 and have fought against Turkey for centuries over disputed territory. Now that the ethnic group is under siege, the destabilization has \u201ccreated a perfect situation for ISIS to capitalize on,\u201d Rita Katz, executive director of the SITE Intelligence Group, a private firm that tracks online extremist activity, told The Washington Post. Trump said in Texas: \u201cI want to thank Turkey\u201d for agreeing to the pause in fighting \u2014 even though it was Turkey that launched the invasion. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten everything we\u2019ve ever dreamed of,\u201d Trump added. He said the Kurds are \u201cincredibly happy\u201d with the \u201csolution.\u201d Trump said the \u201cceasefire\u201d was something that Turkey had been after for 10 years. \u201cYou would have lost millions and millions of lives. They couldn\u2019t get it without a little \u2018rough love,\u2019 as I called it ... they needed a little bit of that at the beginning,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd then everybody said, \u2018Wow, this is tougher than we thought.\u2019 When those guns start shooting, they tend to do things.\u201d Trump called it a \u201cgreat day for the United States. It\u2019s a great day for Turkey ... The Kurds were great. Great day for the Kurds. It\u2019s really a great day for civilization.\u201d On Wednesday Trump said that the Kurdish allies were \u201cno angels\u201d and said that in some cases they represent a threat more dangerous than ISIS, whom the Kurds fought against with American troops in Syria. He stated that Turkey\u2019s invasion of Syria \u201chas nothing to do with us.\u201d The House on Wednesday voted overwhelmingly,\u00a0354 to 60, to denounce the U.S. troop withdrawal in Syria;\u00a0129 Republicans joined all the Democrats in the vote on the resolution.",

            "content": " President Donald Trump warned Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan not to be a \u201ctough guy\u201d or a \u201cfool\u201d in a letter sent as Turkey launched its invasion on northern Syria. A senior White House official has confirmed that the Oct. 9 letter, released Wednesday, is authentic. \u201cDear Mr. President: Let\u2019s work out a good deal! You don\u2019t want to be responsible for slaughtering thousands of people, and I don\u2019t want to be responsible for destroying the Turkish economy \u2015 and I will,\u201d the letter begins, before going on to say that the Kurds are willing to negotiate. Trump finalizes the letter by urging the Turkish leader to deal with the issue in the right and humane way, concluding with: \u201cDon\u2019t be a tough guy. Don\u2019t be a fool! I will call you later.\u201d The letter was written on the same day as Turkish military began attacking Kurdish forces, which were allied with the U.S. in the battle against the self-described Islamic State. Days earlier, Trump had\u00a0ordered the withdrawal of U.S. troops from the region, a decision which was met with bipartisan condemnation. In an Oct. 6 statement, the White House announced the decision, saying that Trump had spoken with Erdogan over the phone. \u201cTurkey will soon be moving forward with its long-planned operation into Northern Syria,\u201d the statement from the White House read. \u201cThe United States Armed Forces will not support or be involved in the operation, and United States forces, having defeated the ISIS territorial \u2018Caliphate,\u2019 will no longer be in the immediate area.\u201d The following day, Trump addressed his decision via tweet, warning Turkey not to do anything that he considered to be \u201coff limits\u201d \u2015 and threatening to destroy its economy if it did so. He defended his widely condemned decision to effectively greenlight Turkey\u2019s invasion, which severely jeopardizes the lives of the U.S.-allied Kurdish forces and risks the re-emergence of ISIS, by saying that it was now up to Turkey, Europe, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Russia and the Kurds to \u201cfigure the situation out.\u201d \u201cFighting between various groups that has been going on for hundreds of years. USA should never have been in Middle East,\u201d he wrote in a string of tweets. \u201cThe stupid endless wars, for us, are ending!\u201d On Monday, Trump signed an executive order imposing sanctions and visa bans on top Turkish officials as a mode of punishment for their invasion of Syria. He said he had also increased tariffs on Turkish steel imports and would immediately halt negotiations on a major trade deal with the country. He also said a small number of U.S. troops would remain in Syria. The Senate is working to introduce its own sanctions bill against Turkey, saying that Trump\u2019s orders are insufficient. Before the release of the letter Wednesday, the president muddied the waters further, undercutting the longstanding alliance between the Kurdish forces and the U.S. during a news conference, in which he said the Kurds are \u201cnot angels\u201d and that Turkey\u2019s invasion of Syria was \u201cnot our problem\u201d \u2015 even as Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo were scheduled to travel to Turkey that day to negotiate a ceasefire. In a meeting earlier in the day with Democratic leaders in Congress to discuss the president\u2019s handling of the Turkey crisis, Trump bragged about the \u201cnasty\u201d letter he sent to Erdogan, according to a senior aide cited by NBC News.

Erdogan vowed to press on with the offensive in northern Syria until his mission to create a \u201csafe zone\u201d was complete and the region was cleared of Kurdish forces.

            "content": " WASHINGTON \u2015 Republicans are apoplectic about Donald Trump\u2019s abrupt decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, calling it a shameful betrayal of the Kurds to a deadly Turkish invasion that could lead to a resurgence of the Islamic State in the Middle East. But ask them what Congress \u2015 an independent institution charged with oversight of the executive branch \u2015 ought to do to remedy the situation, and they scratch their heads, unable to come up with an answer. \u201cIt\u2019s a great question. It\u2019s such a big problem right now, it\u2019s going to take some time to unravel what the next step should be,\u201d Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said Wednesday. Even Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), one of Trump\u2019s biggest critics who called the situation in Syria a \u201cvery dark moment in American history,\u201d struggled to name a solution. \u201cWe\u2019ve created an extraordinary mess, and the path forward is certainly unclear,\u201d Romney told reporters on Capitol Hill. On the table is a bipartisan sanctions bill introduced by Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) that would unleash a series of economic sanctions against Turkey for its incursion into Syria, where a number of human rights violations have been reported following Trump\u2019s decision to effectively greenlight the invasion by pulling U.S. troops out of northern Syria. It\u2019s not clear, however, how much support there is for such a bill, nor whether it would prove effective. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has notably not committed to bringing it to the floor for a vote. Nor has the Kentucky Republican said whether he\u2019ll allow a vote on a nonbinding bipartisan, bicameral resolution opposing Trump\u2019s Syria policy that passed in the House on Wednesday by a 354-60 vote. \u201cTurkey is a NATO ally, and we don\u2019t want to totally fracture our relationship with them. We don\u2019t want to further drive them into the arms of the Russians,\u201d McConnell said at a weekly news conference Wednesday. Though McConnell voiced support for the Kurds and expressed his hope that a Thursday trip by Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to Turkey \u201ccan somehow repair the damage\u201d in the region, he made no remarks during an explosive meeting with Trump and other top congressional lawmakers at the White House on Wednesday afternoon. During that discussion in the Cabinet Room, Trump berated House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) after she spoke out against the president\u2019s handling of the Syria crisis. Trump, according to Pelosi, had a \u201cmeltdown\u201d and offered no strategy for dealing with the situation going forward. Only two Republicans spoke in the meeting: Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas. Earlier Wednesday, Trump further undermined the long-standing alliance between U.S. and Kurdish forces who have been fighting alongside each other against ISIS in Syria. The president said that the Kurds are \u201cnot angels\u201d and that Turkey\u2019s invasion of Syria is \u201cnot our problem.\u201d The Trump administrations\u2019 abrupt foreign policy shift in the Middle East has brought bipartisan backlash from lawmakers, including top Trump ally Graham. The South Carolina Republican warned Trump was committing the \u201cthe biggest mistake of his presidency\u201d by abandoning the Kurds, but he held out hope that Trump might yet correct course on Syria. \u201cI fear this is a complete and utter national security disaster in the making, and I hope President Trump will adjust his thinking,\u201d Graham tweeted Wednesday. Democrats, meanwhile, were skeptical that Republicans might take more drastic action in seeking to force Trump to alter course in the Middle East.\u00a0As chairman of the powerful Senate Judiciary Committee, for example, Graham could hold up the president\u2019s nominations to federal courts as leverage over the president. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee could also hold hearings into the matter. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s likely to happen. Come on. Take a look around,\u201d Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) told HuffPost on Wednesday.",

            "content": " President Donald Trump raged against Democrats and the House impeachment inquiry during his campaign rally Thursday in Dallas, arguing that the Democratic Party,\u00a0including 2020 presidential rival Joe Biden, had \u201cbetrayed our country.\u201d \u201cAt stake in this fight is the survival of American democracy itself. Don\u2019t kid yourself,\u201d Trump, largely going off-script, told supporters at American Airlines Arena. \u201cThey are destroying this country, but we will never let it happen, not even close. For three straight years, radical Democrats have been trying to overthrow the results of a great, great election.\u201d The president has been on the defense in recent weeks as a parade of former administration officials have spoken to House investigators, shedding new light on Trump\u2019s demands that Ukraine investigate political rival Biden and his son.\u00a0Lawmakers have fired off a slate of subpoenas to interview current and former diplomats and administration officials in recent weeks, and, despite the White House\u2019s efforts to keep them from testifying, they have been talking at length. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) opened the formal impeachment inquiry last month after a whistleblower complaint about Trump\u2019s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The White House released a reconstruction of the conversation, during which Trump repeatedly asked his counterpart to investigate the Bidens. Hunter Biden had served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company for five years. The call came shortly after Trump ordered his aides to put on hold nearly $400 million in military funding that had been appropriated for Ukraine, and critics have claimed the call reflected a clear demand for a quid pro quo for political help. In Texas, Trump repeated a slate of conspiracy theories featuring the Bidens, accusing the father and son of engaging in impropriety while Joe Biden was vice president. Neither has been accused of any wrongdoing, and Hunter Biden said earlier this month he did nothing \u201cimproper.\u201d But despite Trump\u2019s assertions, the drama around his call with Ukraine deepened Thursday within his own orbit as acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney held an extraordinary press conference in which he\u00a0confirmed that Trump ordered the military aid to be withheld unless Zelensky agreed to help in the U.S. election. Mulvaney\u2019s remarks to the press prompted a maelstrom within the White House and undercut Trump\u2019s own denials, but Mulvaney walked them back just hours later. He placed blame on the media for misconstruing his comments \u201cto advance a biased and political witch hunt against President Trump\u201d and said there was \u201cabsolutely no quid pro quo\u201d demanded by the White House. Trump echoed that in Dallas before going on a tear against Pelosi and the anonymous whistleblower, calling the House speaker \u201ccrazy\u201d and \u201cnuts.\u201d The criticism came a day after Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said the president insulted Pelosi during a meeting at the White House, referring to her as a \u201cthird-grade politician.\u201d Pelosi fired back that Trump had a \u201cmeltdown\u201d during the discussion. \u201cI really don\u2019t believe anymore that they love our country. I don\u2019t believe it. Crazy Nancy. That crazy Nancy, she is crazy,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey come after me, but what they\u2019re really doing is they\u2019re coming after the Republican Party and what they\u2019re really, really doing is they\u2019re coming after and fighting you, and we never lose.\u201d The president also demanded once again to face his whistleblower and lobbed criticism at the intelligence community inspector general, Michael Atkinson, who first received the complaint and deemed it urgent and credible. \u201cWhat about the whistleblower? The whistleblower got it all wrong,\u201d Trump, appearing enraged, said. \u201cWho\u2019s the whistleblower? We have to know. Is the whistleblower the spy?\u201d",

            "content": "DALLAS \u2015 President Donald Trump said Thursday that he had to let Kurdish allies and Turkey \u201cfight a little while\u201d before the U.S. would be able to stop the Turkish attack on northern Syria that the president himself had enabled. \u201cSometimes you have to let them fight a little while, then people find out how tough the fighting is,\u201d he told supporters at his campaign rally in Dallas. \u201cSometimes you have to let them fight like two kids in a lot, you gotta let them fight, and then you pull them apart.\u201d Earlier Thursday, the White House said Turkey agreed to temporarily halt deadly military operations against northern Syria, a region that\u2019s been held by Kurdish allies who had been fighting ISIS alongside the U.S. troops until Trump decided to abruptly withdraw earlier this month. The agreement gives the Kurds some time to give up their weapons and leave the region that Turkey has been trying to capture. It will allow Turkish forces to take over northern Syria. The deal worked \u201cwithout spilling a drop of American blood,\u201d Trump told supporters at the rally. The withdrawal decision led to Turkey attacking the Kurdish-held region with at least 180 airstrikes as of Thursday morning, killing at least 16 fighters, four civilians (including an infant), and injuring at least 70 more in border towns, according to The New York Times.\u00a0Hundreds of thousands of Kurds have fled northeastern Syria since Trump\u2019s announcement to withdraw the U.S. troops. The deal, which Turkey\u2019s foreign minister clarified as a \u201cpause\u201d and not a ceasefire, creates a five-day halt in Turkey\u2019s attack against the Kurds, whom the country considers terrorists. The deal came after Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo traveled to Turkey to prevent an escalation of the violence that Trump had effectively greenlighted. \u201cDuring a five-day period, we\u2019re going to see if we can get it all finalized, and I think it will be,\u201d Trump said Thursday evening. \u201cSo Turkey\u2019s going to be happy, the Kurds are going to be happy, ISIS is going to be unhappy.\u201d Trump sympathized with Turkey at the campaign rally, calling the country\u2019s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan a \u201cgentleman\u201d and saying that Turkey \u201cwas having a lot of bad things happen from this region, in all fairness.\u201d The president has faced overwhelming backlash by both Democrats and Republicans for his decision to withdraw U.S. troops from the Kurdish-held region, basically allowing Turkish forces to invade while leaving the Kurds vulnerable. Many said the decision would likely lead to a resurgence of ISIS, made more likely after hundreds of ISIS supporters escaped detention in northern Syria as a result of Trump\u2019s move. On Wednesday, Trump made a series of comments undermining the U.S. alliance with the Kurds, saying the fighters were \u201cnot angels\u201d and the Turkish invasion \u201cnot our problem.\u201d The Senate on Thursday introduced sanctions on Turkey, a more detailed and punitive measure than the sanctions Trump imposed earlier this week. The House voted overwhelmingly Wednesday to condemn Trump\u2019s recent foreign policy decision in the Middle East. Trump has continued to defend his decision, saying this week that it was \u201cstrategically brilliant.\u201d On Wednesday, after the House vote, the president berated House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in a meeting meant to be about Trump\u2019s plan of action on Syria. Some supporters at the rally thought Trump made the right move in pulling the U.S. troops from the region, citing the need for the country to stay out of wars. \u201cWe need to get out of there. We\u2019ve been having wars for no reason for pretty much my entire life,\u201d 40-year-old Josh Warren of Garland, Texas, told HuffPost. \u201c[President George W.] Bush put us in those wars. They were wars to fill his pockets. Bush wasn\u2019t really for this country.\u201d \u201cI think he needs to bring our American troops home,\u201d said Debbie Bewley. \u201cI don\u2019t think we need to be involved in useless wars.\u201d",

            "content": " DALLAS \u2015 President Donald Trump brushed off impeachment concerns, railed against Democrats and promised to deliver a resounding victory in the 2020 election at a rally here Thursday attended by thousands of cheering supporters. A sea of red hats and shirts calling for \u201cliberal tears\u201d and \u201cTrump 2020: No more bullshit\u201d flooded downtown Dallas ahead of the rally. Thousands of supporters came, with some arriving two days early. Volunteers collected signatures for a petition demanding an end to the impeachment inquiry in the House of Representatives. \u201cThey should stop the impeachment because the president is doing a great job,\u201d said Alan Bewley, a Trump supporter who lives on a country road 90 minutes outside Dallas. In the speech, Trump hurled insults against leading liberal figures like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (\u201ccrazy\u201d), former Vice President Joe Biden (\u201csleepy\u201d), former U.S. Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas (\u201cvery dumb\u201d) and elected Democrats in general (\u201cvery sick\u201d). Biden and O\u2019Rourke are among Trump\u2019s 2020 rivals. \u201cThey want to impose an extreme agenda,\u201d Trump said of the Democrats. \u201cThey cannot pass it and they cannot win it at the ballot box. They won\u2019t come close in 2020. They know it \u2015 they\u2019re not going to win it\u2026 It\u2019s going to be a landslide.\u201d But behind Trump\u2019s show of force lies lackluster polling numbers, a weakening Republican Party and uncertainty about whether the president is more of an asset or a liability for the conservative control of the country\u2019s largest red state. Dallas itself is a Democratic stronghold, so Trump\u2019s visit offered a moment for the president to connect with supporters in the surrounding suburbs and rural areas, where he remains popular. But Democrats are gaining on Republicans across Texas. They sharply narrowed the statewide gap in last year\u2019s midterm election, led by O\u2019Rourke\u2019s near-miss Senate campaign. Republicans\u2019 margin of victory in that statewide race was not the double-digit thumping they\u2019re used to here. Sen. Ted Cruz held on to his seat in a less-than-3-percentage-point squeaker, and the power of the far-right dwindled in the Statehouse. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign hinged on the use of Trump as a foil. \u201cTrump is without question the worst thing that has happened to the Texas Republican Party in the last 20 years,\u201d Rice University political scientist Mark Jones said. \u201cHe single-handedly turned Texas from a red state to a pink state.\u201d Some Texas Republicans have echoed that theory behind closed doors. \u201cWith all due respect to Trump, who I love, by the way, he\u2019s killing us in the urban-suburban districts,\u201d Texas House Speaker Dennis Bonnen said in a private meeting in June, according to secretly recorded audio released this week. \u201cThe only reason Donald Trump is in Texas tonight is that he knows he will lose the state and lose this election,\u201d Texas Democratic Party Chairman Gilberto Hinojosa said in a statement. \u201cSeveral polls show Trump losing Texas to top Democratic contenders. Donald Trump is terrified.\u201d Trump carried Texas in 2016 by 9 percentage points. But 48% of Texas voters said they definitely wouldn\u2019t vote for Trump in 2020, according to a Quinnipiac poll released last month, compared with 35% who said they\u2019d definitely support him. Other surveys have shown leading Democrats within the margin of error in head-to-head matches with Trump. Texas leaders who joined Trump, however, offered full-throated support and cast aside concerns that the state could flip as an invention of the media. \u201cIf they take Texas, they will take the U.S. Senate. If they take Texas, they will take the White House. But we can\u2019t let that happen \u2015 not on our watch,\u201d Sen. John Cornyn said at the rally. \u201cWe know the liberals who are running against President Trump want open borders, socialized medicine. They want to bankrupt Texas with the Green New Deal.\u201d Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick urged the crowd to boo O\u2019Rourke repeatedly and excoriated the \u201cprogressive left\u201d as \u201cour enemy.\u201d Patrick bragged that the president would draw more people to the portable toilets at his rally than O\u2019Rourke would draw at the counter-rally in nearby Grand Prairie. Thursday\u2019s rally marked Trump\u2019s second major political event this year. He also held a major rally in El Paso back in February aimed at drumming up support for his proposed border wall and to take jabs at O\u2019Rourke after his Senate run. He also visited in April for fundraising.",

            "content": " Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) beat out Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) for the endorsement of the Working Families Party, one of the country\u2019s most influential progressive organizations. The decision came down to three main factors,\u00a0according to six people who participated in the WFP\u2019s endorsement process:\u00a0her more aggressive outreach to key decision-makers, her strong commitment to racial and gender equity, and the perception that she has broader national appeal. Warren \u201chas a long track record of working with our folks on issues from the foreclosure crisis to the sale of homes to Wall Street,\u201d said Jonathan Westin, the executive director of the low-income activist group New York Communities for Change and one of two people who cast votes for Warren on behalf of the New York WFP state committee. \u201cA lot of it stems from how she has run her campaign. From the beginning, she centered racial inequality in her campaign. She went to Jackson, Mississippi, and talked to these issues head on. It was not an addendum.\u201d Since announcing its endorsement of Warren on Monday, the Working Families Party has been bombarded with complaints from Sanders supporters questioning whether the outcome of the vote reflected the views of WFP leaders \u2014 who they suspect put Warren over the top \u2014 or the group\u2019s more numerous dues-paying members and supporters. The votes of the former were represented by 56 delegates on the WFP\u2019s national committee, including Westin, and were weighted to make up half of the total endorsement vote. An estimated 10,000 of WFP\u2019s dues-paying members and other progressive activists who participated in the online ballot made up the other half. HuffPost spoke with Westin and five other WFP state and regional leaders whose votes in state-level plebiscites determined the way their national committee delegates voted. The goal of HuffPost\u2019s inquiry was not to assess the fairness of WFP\u2019s endorsement process, but to get a sense of why many delegates chose Warren. In addition to Westin, HuffPost spoke with Andrea Serrano, executive director of the Albuquerque, New Mexico, nonprofit Ol\u00e9; Stephanie Zucker, a WFP activist from near Morgantown, West Virginia; and three other New Yorkers: education activist Billy Easton, organized labor official Sandra Cuellar Oxford and fair housing advocate David Schwartz. Easton, Oxford and Schwartz cast votes that bound New York\u2019s delegates to Warren; Zucker and her fellow West Virginia WFP committee members voted to have their national delegates endorse Warren as well. Serrano would not say how the New Mexico WFP affiliate voted, but described what people who participated in the process found attractive in Warren\u2019s candidacy. As with the four other candidates the WFP considered endorsing, Sanders sat for a public, live-streamed endorsement interview, where he was questioned by WFP national organizing director Nelini Stamp and WFP activists. But Sanders did not participate in a later video conference call with WFP national delegates and members of the WFP\u2019s state committees.\u00a0On that call, presidential candidates could make their case for an endorsement directly to the people with a say in the matter. Warren and former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Juli\u00e1n Castro availed themselves of the opportunity; Sanders did not. \u201cIt was an opportunity for Bernie and his people to make their pitch. It\u2019s a lost opportunity,\u201d said Oxford, a WFP leader in upstate New York. Sanders\u2019 absence did not sway Oxford per se, who cited other reasons for her vote for Warren. But for other WFP leaders, it reflected Warren\u2019s greater affinity for the political art of courting allies, an activity that critics and supporters alike say Sanders has been less invested in over the course of his career. \u201cThis is the thing about Warren, you see it in her selfie lines: She\u2019ll put in all of the work to try and connect with a voter, to try and secure an endorsement \u2015 like she was trying to do in the WFP process \u2015 and to make her case,\u201d said Westin, who voted for Sanders in the WFP\u2019s endorsement process for the 2016 election cycle. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s actually a quality that we need in terms of somebody who is going to beat Trump.\u201d Prior to the endorsement process, Warren had likewise exhibited a knack for politicking that was unmatched by Sanders. A week before the WFP revealed the results of its endorsement process, she endorsed Kendra Brooks, a WFP candidate for one of two at-large Philadelphia city council seats that are effectively reserved for non-Democrats, and currently occupied by Republicans. Warren also endorsed Stephen Smith, the WFP-backed progressive running for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in West Virginia. Sanders, whose political director Analilia Mejia previously ran the New Jersey Working Families Party, could have one-upped Warren by endorsing both Brooks and Nicolas O\u2019Rourke, the second WFP candidate for Philadelphia city council. Instead, he endorsed neither of them. \u201cSupporting progressive Black and other women of color for office is always a positive thing,\u201d Serrano said. The Sanders campaign did not immediately provide an explanation for Sanders\u2019 decisions not to participate in the video conference call, or endorse in the Philadelphia city council races. Sanders has worked hard to dispel the perception, formed during his 2016 presidential run, that he is insufficiently committed to addressing injustices like racism and sexism on their own terms, rather than strictly as manifestations of economic inequality. He hired a more diverse contingent of senior campaign staff; featured race more prominently in his stump speech; took pains to court influential Black leaders in early primary states like South Carolina; and produced, among other things, a far-reaching criminal justice reform platform that seeks to redress racist practices. But several of the WFP leaders who spoke to HuffPost still consider Warren to be more genuinely committed to combating racial inequity, in particular, as a form of injustice that must be addressed independent of structural economic problems. Warren\u2019s remarks in Detroit in July about countering the effects of historic housing discrimination in Black neighborhoods stood out to Easton, who runs the Alliance for Quality Education in Albany, New York,\u00a0and considers racial justice the most important issue in the race. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen a white candidate for major office be crystal clear and direct and so effective, breaking down the concept in a way people can understand,\u201d he said. Serrano argued that, by contrast, Sanders\u2019 attempts to broaden his message outward from the economy had been inadequate. \u201cIt is not OK to separate class from race and gender \u2026 People have tried to say, \u2018Do better on this subject,\u2019 and it just doesn\u2019t seem to last,\u201d she said. Conversely, some of the WFP stakeholders cited Warren\u2019s identification as a capitalist seeking to put a check on the economic system\u2019s most oppressive features, rather than replace it, as both more in line with their own thinking, and evidence of her broader national appeal. Zucker, who is a part owner of her family\u2019s veterinary hospital, described Warren\u2019s vision as \u201ccapitalism with a conscience\u201d and said she shares that view. \u201cI\u2019m fully in support of [Sanders\u2019] policies in the vast majority of areas. But I think Elizabeth Warren is doing a better job of communicating what I believe is their shared vision of a just economy.\u201d Others spoke more generally about what they see as Warren\u2019s success expanding beyond a core group of left-wing supporters. \u201cI really feel that Elizabeth Warren would have a better shot at unifying the left and the center. We can\u2019t just think we\u2019re going to go as far left as we can and bring the center along with us,\u201d Oxford said. \u201cI feel that Elizabeth has been somewhat more conciliatory and offered a larger tent to those who definitely won\u2019t vote for Bernie.\u201d Sanders supporters point to polling that has shown higher levels of support\u00a0for Sanders than Warren among working-class voters and, until recently, Black voters, as evidence that he is better equipped to build a winning, national coalition. But Warren\u2019s supporters in the WFP believe that her base of support will continue to diversify as more Americans pay attention to the primary race. \u201cMy membership is low-income people of color and my membership absolutely loves Elizabeth Warren,\u201d Westin said. \u201c[Former vice president] Joe Biden and Bernie have been big names for years. People are just tuning into the race.\u201d Given the complexity of the WFP\u2019s endorsement process, it is not surprising that it has generated some skepticism. Sanders partisans \u2014 acting with some encouragement from the Sanders campaign \u2014 have urged the WFP to release a breakdown of the vote that would show whether Warren won the endorsement thanks to the national delegates or had enough support to win among the dues-paying members and associated activists who voted. \u201cWhy don\u2019t they want to release it?\u201d wrote Matt Bruenig, a founder of the People\u2019s Policy Project, a left-wing think tank. \u201cYou hate to speculate about such things, but the only answer is because the member votes went for Sanders while the leadership votes went for Warren, and the organization is embarrassed to reveal the degree to which the leadership overruled the membership.\u201d The WFP says it is refusing to release the figures because to do so would create an artificial division in the status of different voters, when all of the votes cast are equally legitimate. In some cases, the distinctions might be hazy anyway. Schwartz, Zucker and Easton all voted in the online general membership ballot in addition to casting their state committee votes. More broadly, the WFP defends its practice of granting its most committed activists and partner organizations an outsize say in its endorsement, particularly given the grassroots constituencies they each represent. By contrast, an assortment of sympathetic progressives who were not previously involved in WFP were free to participate in the larger membership vote if they affirmed the WFP\u2019s values through the completion of an online form by Sept. 6. Some Sanders supporters mobilized people to participate on Reddit. And the Progressive Change Campaign Committee leveraged its considerable email list to encourage its activists to cast votes for Warren. The WFP also noted that in the 2016 endorsement process, the votes of national delegates were weighted to make up 87.5% of the total vote share \u2015 far more than in the 2020 endorsement process. Those national delegates represented a group of WFP stakeholders that was less diverse and more conservative, including a number of labor unions that departed the organization in 2018 in protest of its endorsement of Cynthia Nixon\u2019s candidacy\u00a0for New York governor. The WFP only ended up endorsing Sanders in the 2016 election cycle, over many of those stakeholders\u2019 protestations, because 87% of the dues-paying members and other activists \u2014 who got the remaining one-eighth of the vote not held by national leaders \u2014 backed Sanders. Part of Bruenig\u2019s argument for the WFP to release the breakdown of its vote, is precisely that the organization released a breakdown of Sanders\u2019 share of the non-leadership vote when it announced its endorsement in Dec. 2015. But the WFP released the figure in the 2016 election cycle as a show of force for Sanders amid deep skepticism from within the WFP\u2019s national stakeholders. The fury expressed by many Sanders supporters toward the WFP endorsement reflects the realization of socialists who got involved in politics thanks to Sanders\u2019 2016 campaign that they are not as closely aligned with the national WFP as they previously thought. In New York City in particular, members of the Democratic Socialists of America have worked closely with the WFP. New York City DSA, which endorsed Nixon at the WFP\u2019s urging over the objections of many of its members, provided an essential army of door knockers for her ultimately unsuccessful campaign. But while there is considerable overlap, DSA members are more uniformly socialist in their political outlook than the average WFP activist. Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, is the most conservative presidential contender for whom they are willing to consider mobilizing their membership to support. For example, Sanders has been far more consistent and emphatic than Warren in his support for \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d which is perhaps the single highest policy priority of DSA members. \u201cThe split is between people who came into politics long before 2016 and have been doing progressive politics as a profession for a long time, and the movement that was sparked by the Sanders campaign,\u201d said Michael Kinnucan, a member of the NYC DSA. \u201cHis campaign got thousands of people involved in American politics at the rank-and-file level, in DSA and elsewhere, and that movement has begun to reshape American politics. Those folks do feel betrayed that the power and potential of that movement is not recognized by some people in the Working Families Party.\u201d",

            "content": " For the third time in a row, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren pulled off a well-received debate performance, new polling finds. More broadly, the state of the 2020 campaign appears to remain much where it\u2019s stood since August: Former Vice President Joe Biden continues to lead in the horse race polls, trailed by Warren and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. A few other metrics suggest Warren may be positioned for further growth. And most primary voters remain very far from locked into a decision, meaning there\u2019s plenty of room for things to change. Thirty-seven percent of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters who saw at least clips of the debate last Thursday said they came away with an improved view of Warren, according to a new HuffPost/YouGov survey, while just 9% said their opinions of her worsened. That\u2019s not as dramatic as her reception in the first and second debates, when half or more reported improved views, but it\u2019s still enough to place her ahead of her rivals this round. Three other candidates also saw their positive ratings for the debates significantly outstrip their negatives: South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg (31% had an improved view of him compared to 11% whose view worsened); former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (30% improved to 13% worsened) and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker (26% improved to 11% worsened). Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro \u2015 who aggressively challenged Biden onstage \u2015 saw the worst numbers (15% improved compared to 41% worsened), with the remaining candidates breaking more or less close to even. The standard\u00a0provisos about debate polling\u00a0remain\u00a0relevant here: Voters\u2019 preexisting opinions of the candidates help to shape their reactions; opinions remain fluid; and, of course, impressing voters in a debate doesn\u2019t necessarily translate into gaining even temporary ground in the horse race. Plenty of voters, as FiveThirtyEight notes, didn\u2019t even watch the debate. In the HuffPost/YouGov survey, only about 55% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters said they caught even clips of the event. Perhaps the clearest example of the debates affecting this race so far has been California Sen. Kamala Harris\u2019 brief surge following a strong initial performance, and her subsequent fall from the top tier of polling when she failed to match it in subsequent debates. By contrast, Sanders\u2019 poll numbers have remained basically stable since summer, while Warren\u2019s rise has appeared gradual and largely untethered to any specific incident. \u201cWe\u2019re practically raised to believe that debates impact election results in big ways. Millions watch, candidates spend countless hours preparing, media can\u2019t stop talking, and writing, about them.\u00a0And, after all, we\u2019re taught debates are the way we should be making voting decisions.\u00a0They\u2019ve just got to be game-changers,\u201d Democratic pollster Mark Mellman wrote. \u201cBut they\u2019re not ... Voters in the early states will get lots more direct exposure to the candidates through other mechanisms.\u201d To examine the broader state of the race beyond debate night, the new HuffPost/YouGov poll also asked voters to look over the full slate of Democratic candidates and pick whom they\u2019d be enthusiastic or upset to see nominated, and who they believe is capable of defeating President Donald Trump. Biden still holds a clear, if not overwhelming, lead on electability: A 66% majority of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters thinks the former vice president is capable of winning the general election, a recovery of nearly 10 points since this summer. A smaller 56% majority currently believes Warren can win, with half saying the same of Sanders. Fewer than one-third say the same of any of the other candidates. Warren, meanwhile, stands out on enthusiasm, with 48% saying they\u2019d be enthusiastic about having her as the Democratic nominee and only 9% saying they\u2019re upset by that prospect. The idea of a Biden nomination raises only slightly less excitement (41% would be enthusiastic) but higher discontent (25% would be upset); a hypothetical Sanders nomination leaves 39% enthusiastic and 17% upset. Although Warren has often looked particularly strong in YouGov\u2019s polling compared to other outlets, other recent polling shows similar results. FiveThirtyEight/Ipsos debate polling also gives Warren strong reviews for last week\u2019s debate. And in an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll released this week, Warren led\u00a0both on enthusiasm and as the candidate with whom most primary voters would feel, at least, comfortable. Nearly all national polling that asks a straightforward horse race question \u2015 whom people would vote for if the election were today \u2015 shows Biden still ahead. But there\u2019s a significant variation on the exact size of Biden\u2019s lead, as well as whether Warren or Sanders now stands as his closest rival. One reason for that volatility is that the race remains exceptionally fluid. In\u00a0the HuffPost/YouGov survey, only 52% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters say they have even a good idea about whom they\u2019ll support, and in the NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, only 9% of Democratic primary voters said they\u2019d definitely made up their minds. There\u2019s still months until anyone starts voting, and things could change pretty quickly once they do. For now, \u201cundecided\u201d may still be the real front-runner.

South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who trails the other top fundraisers by significant margins in public polling, raised just over $19 million. \u201cThis means our grassroots movement is in an incredible position \u2014 to double down on our investments in grassroots organizing, to keep getting Elizabeth\u2019s plans for big, structural change in front of more caucus-goers and voters, and to bring more people into this fight,\u201d campaign manager Roger Lau wrote. It is all but certain that Warren and Sanders \u2015 two left-leaning progressives who have chosen to bypass high-dollar fundraisers during the campaign \u2015 will be the two candidates with the most successful third quarters. Warren, in particular, faced skepticism over her decision to bypass high-dollar fundraising \u2015 an area where she had excelled prior to the 2020 presidential race. \u201cElizabeth didn\u2019t sell her time to wealthy donors, over the phone or in person at closed-door fundraisers,\u201d Lau wrote. \u201cInstead, she got to spend her time traveling across the country, hosting town halls, taking tens of thousands of selfies, and hearing directly from people about what\u2019s on their minds.\u201d Warren, whose steady rise now has her essentially tied with Biden in most public polling, had 943,000 donations from 509,000 different individual donors. The average donation was $26, and the campaign said more than 300,000 people donated for the first time during the third quarter. Among lower-tier candidates, California Sen. Kamala Harris raised $11.6 million, Andrew Yang raised $10 million and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker raised $6 million. Other candidates, including former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, have not yet released their fundraising totals. President Donald Trump\u2019s reelection campaign said that it and the Republican National Committee \u2015 which can collect much bigger checks than the individual Democratic contenders \u2015 raised more than $125 million in the third quarter.",

Afterward, she attended to a four-hour selfie line. \u201cYou know, the selfies are the most fun about this,\u201d Warren told \u201cThe Late Show\u201d host Stephen Colbert. \u201cAnd it truly is the case, because it means you get the person to person about this.\u201d \u201cIt means for every single person who stays in that line, and look, somebody waited four hours, the guy at the end,\u201d she continued. \u201cBut it\u2019s about power and saying, \u2018I get it, we got a Washington that\u2019s working great for the rich and the powerful, not working for much of anyone else, you came in here, you talked about how it\u2019s broken, you talked about how to fix it, and people who say I can do a piece of that, I\u2019m in this fight all the way and I got a selfie to prove it.\u2019 So that\u2019s where we are.\u00a0And it\u2019s fun.\u201d Check out the interview here: Colbert later asked Warren if her assertion at the rally \u2014 that \u201cwe can\u2019t choose a candidate we don\u2019t believe in just because we\u2019re too scared to do anything else\u201d \u2014 was a \u201cveiled shot\u201d at her 2020 rival, former Vice President Joe Biden. \u201cNo, the way I see this, these really are scary times,\u201d Warren responded. \u201cIt\u2019s scary times because Donald Trump is truly a terrible president.

            "content": " The Working Families Party, a leading progressive organization with roots in organized labor, announced Monday that it is endorsing the presidential bid of Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. The group\u2019s backing provides a boost to Warren as she seeks to solidify her climb in the polls and replace Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent, as the leading alternative on the left to former Vice President Joe Biden. \u201cSenator Warren strikes fear into the hearts of the robber barons who rigged the system, and offers hope to millions of working people who have been shut out of our democracy and economy,\u201d Maurice Mitchell, Working Families Party national director, said in a statement. \u201cOur job now is to help Senator Warren build the mass movement that will make her transformational plans a reality.\u201d As part of the group\u2019s endorsement process, Mitchell grilled five presidential candidates \u2015 Warren, Sanders, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, former Housing Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio \u2015 on live broadcasts that gave members the opportunity to submit questions or ask them live. Warren distinguished herself in her interview by, among other things, promising to repeal the 1994 crime bill authored by Biden. The group\u2019s interview with Booker proved more contentious, with an extended discussion of his ties to controversial Garden State political bosses. Sen. Kamala Harris of California canceled her interview with the organization, citing a scheduling conflict, a decision that prompted the group to take her out of the running.\u00a0The group had ruled out all but those six candidates based on their answers to a questionnaire. The endorsement, reflecting the views of 61% of Working Families Party members and leaders in a ranked-choice voting system, is a particularly sharp disappointment for Sanders, who picked up the group\u2019s backing in the 2016 election cycle, but received just 36% of the vote from participating members this time around. The Sanders campaign\u2019s political director, Analilia Mejia, is the former executive director of the New Jersey Working Families Party. Mitchell acknowledged Sanders\u2019 role as a progressive trailblazer in his statement on the endorsement. \u201cSenator Warren and Senator Sanders have both shaped the ideological terrain on which this campaign is being waged,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cThey have proven an effective team on debate stages and in the polls, and we hope that partnership continues. We\u2019re proud to call both of them allies in the fight for a more just America.\u201d The endorsement nonetheless drew skepticism from Sanders supporters, some of whom questioned the legitimacy of the endorsement process and talked of canceling their dues to the organization. Some Sanders supporters interpreted a Mitchell quote in\u00a0The New York Times in which he warned against progressives who hoped to defeat moderate Democrats with \u201cthought pieces or pithy tweets\u201d as a dig at them. Mitchell denied that was his intention in an interview with HuffPost. \u201cI was talking about the work all of us have to do to defeat the far right and the corporate forces who want to capture the Democratic nomination \u2015 all those forces. We need to organize against them,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201dI wouldn\u2019t take this occasion to choose to settle a score against a candidate who I think is amazing and doing great work.\u201d Mitchell acknowledged, however, that the endorsement causes pain to many Working Families Party members who are staunchly in Sanders\u2019 corner and raises the challenge of moving forward as a unified bloc. \u201cWe knew that this would be a hard vote and that there would be folks who would be very disappointed. And that\u2019s what happens when mature political organizations wrestle around really important decisions,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201dWe\u2019re going to continue to organize and keep our eyes on the prize.\u201d Mitchell and the Working Families Party also stand behind the fairness of the endorsement process. In the previous presidential election cycle, members of the group\u2019s national committee \u2015 the council of unions and grassroots groups that function as its key stakeholders \u2015 held the vast majority of votes in the endorsement process. This year, activists who are not on the national committee \u2015 both dues-paying members and supporters who do not pay dues \u2015 were allotted half of the votes. The roughly 50 activist leaders representing grassroots organizations on WFP\u2019s national committee had votes worth the other half of the total. And while activists who do not pay dues were permitted to cast ballots in the 2016 election cycle, Working Families Party claims it took specific steps to screen them this year, including through an email blast that required progressives to affirm their support for the group\u2019s agenda and proceed through an online portal for voting. In total, about 10,000 people cast ballots, according to the group. The Working Families Party has neither demographic data about the participants in its endorsement process, nor insight into the rationale of activists who opted for Warren over Sanders.\u00a0It likewise declined to provide a breakdown of votes for either candidate based on whether participants were activist leaders with privileged voting status, dues-paying members or mere sympathetic supporters. Mitchell said that, on a personal note, he appreciates Warren\u2019s ability to communicate progressive ideas to a diverse array of people. \u201cWe need a candidate that can break down these concepts in ways that encourage a multiracial alignment of folks to defeat Trump and defeat neo-fascism and I think she\u2019s uniquely positioned to do that,\u201d he said. Warren\u2019s endorsement last Monday of Kendra Brooks, a WFP candidate running for Philadelphia city council, swayed some members of WFP\u2019s leadership with privileged voting status, according to a progressive strategist familiar with these leaders\u2019 thinking. The Working Families Party was founded in 1998 by a coalition of New York labor unions and community organizations hoping to establish a progressive foothold within the Democratic Party-run politics of the Empire State. In New York, where the group retains its largest presence, progressive Democrats have the chance to run on its ballot line as well as that of the Democratic Party as a show of strength from the party\u2019s progressive wing. As Working Families Party has matured, it has gotten bolder in its political stances and more distant from its roots in New York\u2019s labor unions. A decision by the group to endorse Cynthia Nixon\u2019s challenge to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo in the 2018 Democratic primary at once prompted an exodus of nearly all of the labor unions backing the organization and freed it to chart a more independent path. Although New York remains its hub, the Working Families Party now has state-level affiliates in 13 other states and the District of Columbia, as well as local branches in four others. States with affiliates include the general-election battlegrounds of Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The Working Families Party, which often sets up PACs to boost candidates it endorses in state and local elections, has yet to spell out exactly how it will use its resources to buttress Warren\u2019s 2020 bid. Mitchell, who is African American and previously served as a leader of the Black Lives Matter movement, said that the group is well equipped to organize working-class voters and voters of color \u2015 some of the very people polls suggest Warren has had difficulty attracting. Referring to these voting blocs, Mitchell said, \u201cThere are a number of communities that often do not get heard and get taken for granted, unfortunately by a lot of Democrats. It\u2019s going to be our interest to lift them up.\u201d The endorsement from a powerhouse of New York politics comes ahead of a rally Warren is holding in Manhattan\u2019s Washington Square Park on Monday evening. The Warren campaign chose the site for its proximity to the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory, a sweatshop where a fire in 1911 killed 145 garment workers. Warren plans to discuss the resonance that the tragedy, which became a rallying cry for labor organizing in the city and across the country, has for her campaign and the movement she is trying to build.

            "content": "Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s presidential campaign is set to begin a major advertising blitz, spending at least $10 million in the first four states to vote in the 2020 Democratic primary. The campaign also plans to begin hiring staff in primary states that vote in March, including on all-important Super Tuesday. Building operations in the March states is crucial \u2015 three-fifths of the Democratic delegates will be awarded by the end of 2020\u2019s third month. The new spending, announced in a memo to supporters from campaign manager Roger Lau, shows how Warren plans to continue the momentum that\u2019s elevated her into the top tier of primary contenders, alongside Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden. The size of the advertising buy also highlights how Warren has been able to continue raising gobs of cash after deciding to stop attending high-dollar fundraising. \u201cOur biggest expense as a campaign is our staff, but as the campaign heats up, it will be on media to reach potential voters,\u201d Lau wrote in his email. \u201cBecause we\u2019re 100% grassroots funded, we\u2019ve built our team to spend your dollars as effectively as possible to help deliver victory.\u201d Lau said the ad buy will mostly be on digital platforms rather than traditional broadcast television, and the campaign will produce the ads in-house rather than using a traditional media consultant. \u201cTake any of our big problems: Health care, climate change, gun violence. Corruption is at the root of why our government won\u2019t act,\u201d Warren says in a 15-second ad as President Donald Trump and former House Speaker Paul Ryan appear onscreen. \u201cI\u2019m Elizabeth Warren. I know what\u2019s wrong, I know how to fix it and I\u2019ll fight to get it done.\u201d The Warren campaign also released a 60-second ad highlighting her roots in Oklahoma and the hollowing out of the American middle class, and a 30-second ad highlighting her work to create the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and defeat former GOP Sen. Scott Brown. \u201cLeave it to a liberal professor to highlight a speech she gave at a liberal university in the heart of liberal New York City,\u201d Republican National Committee Communications Director Michael Ahrens said, referring to the 60-second ad that uses footage from her Sept. 17 rally. \u201cWarren may have plans, but they would decimate millions of middle class jobs and eliminate health plans for 200 million Americans.\u201d Lau provided fewer details on the campaign\u2019s staffing plans in the March states, but highlights Illinois, California, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Texas and Florida as places where it will make investments. \u201cWe\u2019re targeting our resources to invest in places that will be critical to keeping the House, taking back the U.S. Senate, and regaining ground in key state legislatures in 2020,\u201d he wrote. Warren has been steadily rising in the polls and attracting massive crowds to her rallies. She\u2019s eschewed exclusive fundraisers with wealthy donors generally favored by presidential candidates as a way to amass campaign cash, instead relying on grassroots outreach \u2015 more than 1 million donations from all 50 states, D.C., and Puerto Rico. Warren has become known for her personal outreach to supporters. She calls donors out of the blue to thank them for their contribution, and stays for hours after campaign events to take selfies with people. Lau estimates that she has done more than 60,000 selfies and taken more than 600 unfiltered questions at 134 town halls in 27 states and Puerto Rico.

            "author": "",
            "content": "The attempt to pile on Elizabeth Warren has begun. The senator from Massachusetts, who has firmly joined Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and former Vice President Joe Biden in the Democratic presidential field\u2019s top tier, has faced a barrage of critiques in recent days from campaigns who often claim she has received a free pass from the media. Many of these attacks happen without ever mentioning Warren\u2019s name. Candidates \u2015 including Biden, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana \u2015 often talk about how Democrats need to have more than Warren\u2019s signature policy plans in order to win. A staffer for Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) suggested Warren hadn\u2019t done enough to help Democratic candidates in the 2018 midterms. (She donated $11 million to other candidates and progressive causes.) Others have been more direct: The always-colorful, oft-quoted former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell, a Biden surrogate, attacked Warren as a \u201chypocrite\u201d for touting her decision not to hold high-dollar fundraisers after holding them in the past. But the attacks that could land the most damage focus on Warren\u2019s trustworthiness on health care, the No. 1\u00a0issue for voters in both the Democratic primary and in the general election, according to polling. Though Warren has rolled her out own detailed policy plans on everything from gun control to child care to rural economic development, she is the only leading candidate to avoid releasing her own health care plan, instead endorsing Sanders\u2019 \u201cMedicare for All\u201d legislation while saying she remains open to alternatives. The position has left her vulnerable to attacks from Sanders supporters as well as from opponents of Medicare for All, which would eliminate private health insurance and require the government to pay for Americans\u2019 health coverage. Warren\u2019s steady rise in the Democratic primary has come, in large part, from her ability to appeal to both the party\u2019s mainstream and left-wing branches, but health care is an issue that could turn chunks of both groups against her and undercut her central image as a candidate with a brilliant idea for every problem. \u201cI support Medicare for All. I think it\u2019s a good plan,\u201d Warren told CBS after the Sept. 12 Democratic debate in Houston when asked if she would roll out her own health care plan. But she quickly added: \u201cI support a lot of plans, other things that people have come up with it. When they\u2019re good plans, let\u2019s do it. This isn\u2019t some kind of contest, \u2018I got to think of mine first.\u2019 It\u2019s about what\u2019s best for the American people.\u201d Buttigieg, appearing on CNN on Thursday, noted that Warren has avoided explicitly stating if she would support higher taxes on middle-income earners of the kind needed to fund a single-payer system. Two days earlier, during an appearance on \u201cThe Late Show,\u201d Stephen Colbert was unable to pin Warren down on the need for higher taxes to fund Medicare for All. Warren instead stuck to her formulation that under her plan net\u00a0\u201ccosts\u201d would go down\u00a0for the vast majority of Americans because of the elimination of out-of-pocket expenses. \u201cSen. Warren is known for being straightforward and was extremely evasive when asked that question, and we\u2019ve seen that repeatedly,\u201d Buttigieg said of Warren\u2019s refusal to directly answer Colbert\u2019s questions. \u201cI think that if you are proud of your plan and it\u2019s the right plan, you should defend it in straightforward terms.\u201d (Buttigieg, who rolled out his own health care plan on Thursday, has said only that he would fund an expansion of health care coverage by closing corporate tax loopholes, without further details.) Biden echoed this line of attack during a Friday event in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, suggesting Warren and Sanders were hiding the effect of Medicare for All. \u201cYou can\u2019t beat Trump by not being straightforward about what it\u2019s going to do,\u201d he told a voter who questioned why he wasn\u2019t supporting Medicare for All. Buttigieg, along with Biden and other moderate Democrats, has long argued that Sanders\u2019 and Warren\u2019s stated preference for Medicare for All is politically unwise and would cause chaos for tens of millions of Americans with private health insurance. But the recent attacks have focused squarely on the question of tax increases. \u201cIt\u2019s fundamentally dishonest, because for people\u2019s pocketbooks, Medicare for All will be a tax decrease, and the people saying this know that,\u201d said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee and a prominent Warren backer. \u201cIt\u2019s an insurance company and Republican talking point.\u201d Green also claimed Warren\u2019s \u201crefusal to take the bait\u201d was helping her with Democrats. \u201cRepublicans will inevitably make unfair attacks in the general election. We can\u2019t live in fear of that. But we don\u2019t need to give them Democratic validators.\u201d Warren is a relatively recent convert to single-payer, signing on to Sanders\u2019 legislation only in September 2017. Since then, she has continued to work on interim fixes to the private health insurance system. In March 2018, she backed legislation \u2015 co-sponsored by Sanders \u2015 designed to tighten regulations on private insurers and keep them in the Affordable Care Act exchanges. When she first began running for president, she discussed protecting Medicaid more than pushing for single-payer. But at the first Democratic debate on June 27, she made her stance clear: She was\u00a0\u201cwith Bernie on Medicare for All,\u201d including the elimination of private health insurance. Warren reiterated her stance in the two subsequent debates and an interview released earlier this month with dying progressive activist Ady Barkan. Barkan, who has his used his struggles with ALS to help illustrate the need for single-payer health care, specifically pressed her to explain her greater reluctance on the topic closer to the start of her campaign. \u201cThere are areas where markets just don\u2019t work and a big part of health care is one of those,\u201d Warren told Barkan. \u201cSo the idea that we could get a couple of regulations in place and it will sort itself out is just not true with health care.\u201d One advantage for Warren is that the National Nurses United union, a major institutional backer of Medicare for All that endorsed Sanders in the 2016 cycle, has not yet endorsed in the 2020 presidential primary. Asked whether the union considered Warren\u2019s stance adequate, NNU spokesperson Chuck Idelson would not respond directly, instead saying that if the union decides to endorse in the race, it will \u201ccertainly explain\u201d how the endorsement is \u201cconsonant\u201d with its priorities. But Warren\u2019s remarks have failed to assuage left-wing Sanders supporters \u2015 many of whom are associated with the Democratic Socialists of America or Jacobin magazine \u2015\u00a0 who don\u2019t think they can count on her to enact a policy they believe is the bedrock of a robust, contemporary welfare state. They point to small signals from Warren \u2015 her failure to give the plan a prominent place on her campaign website or to give it more than a passing mention in most of her speeches \u2015 as reasons to be skeptical. Natalie Shure, a leading Medicare for All advocate and dues-paying member of the Boston chapter of the DSA, argued Thursday on the popular left-wing YouTube show\u00a0\u201cThe Majority Report\u201d that Warren was not willing to \u201cfight tooth and nail for a robust, single-payer, Medicare for All health care system.\u201d In a follow-up interview with HuffPost, Shure said that Warren\u2019s unwillingness to explicitly embrace the need for middle-class tax hikes to fund Medicare for All is emblematic of her tepidness on the matter. \u201cShe\u2019s simultaneously trying to tap into the activist energy and enthusiasm that activists have spent years building for single-payer and Medicare for All \u2026 without forfeiting any of the plausible deniability or the support of people who wouldn\u2019t want to go that far,\u201d Shure said. That\u2019s a distinction from Sanders, who has staked his presidential run on the ability to galvanize a social movement \u2015 a \u201cpolitical revolution\u201d \u2015 capable of at least generating momentum behind Medicare for All, according to Shure. \u201cShe looks at her role differently than a Sanders presidency would look at his role,\u201d Shure said. \u201cHe would lead a movement to get it, which I think is necessary for anyone who wants it. I don\u2019t think she\u2019d veto it if it came to her desk. She might even whip votes for it. But I don\u2019t think she is going to reach outside of electoral politics for it.\u201d Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, a Sanders stalwart who carried the single-payer bill in the House, put it more gently. Warren \u201chasn\u2019t eased up on it. She hasn\u2019t wavered, gotten weak in the knees,\u201d he said, referring to Warren\u2019s recent remarks affirming her support for the policy. \u201cBut I think it means something that Bernie carried the bill, wrote the bill and has been fighting for it even before it was a popular thing.\u201d",

            "content": "NEW YORK \u2015\u00a0Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) drew thousands of New Yorkers to her presidential campaign rally Monday in Washington Square Park, where she discussed her plans to fight corruption and support workers nationwide. The Democratic presidential hopeful honored the scores of mostly immigrant women who died in the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire of 1911 \u2014 which occurred about a block from where Warren spoke Monday \u2014 and praised the women\u2019s trade unions that fought for change in the wake of the tragedy. \u201cWe\u2019re not here today because of famous arches or famous men,\u201d Warren said, referring to the park\u2019s iconic arch looming behind her, which is named for President George Washington. \u201cIn fact, we\u2019re not here because of men at all. We\u2019re here because of some hard-working women. Women who, more than a hundred years ago, worked long hours in a brown, 10-story building a block that way.\u201d Nearly 150 people \u2015 mostly Jewish and Italian female workers \u2015 died in March 1911 when the factory went up in flames and their bosses, fearing the employees might steal scraps of fabric, trapped them inside by locking the exit doors. \u201cIt was one of the worst industrial disasters in American history,\u201d Warren said. \u201cOne of the worst, but it should not have been a surprise.\u201d Working conditions at the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory were infamous, but the company\u2019s owners were wealthy, politically connected and corrupt, she said. \u201cThey made campaign contributions and talked with their friends in the legislature,\u201d Warren said. \u201cThey greased the state government so thoroughly that nothing changed. Business owners got richer, politicians got more powerful, and working people paid the price.\u201d \u201cDoes any of this sound familiar?\u201d she asked the crowd, which responded with an affirmative cheer. \u201cTake any big problem we have in America today and you don\u2019t have to dig very deep to see the same system at work.\u201d The Harvard law professor-turned-senator\u2019s rally in Manhattan is the culmination of a day filled with headline-generating announcements designed to cement her second-place standing in many early polls and replace Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) as the left\u2019s alternative to former Vice President Joe Biden. Warren unveiled a plan early Monday morning to combat Washington corruption that builds on legislation she introduced in August 2018 curbing, among other things, the influence of lobbyists. A few hours later, she received the endorsement of the Working Families Party, a national progressive organization that backed Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in the 2016 election cycle. At the rally, Warren also debuted the endorsements of two young, progressive New York state lawmakers, state Sen. Alessandra Biaggi and Assemblywoman Yuh-Line Niou, who said that Warren would finish the fight against corruption that they were waging in New York\u2019s capital of Albany. Biaggi was part of a crop of six left-leaning Democrats who unseated a rogue faction of Democratic state senators aligned with the GOP who effectively kept the legislative chamber in Republican control. (Biaggi and Niou are part of a list of 14 New York City and state lawmakers who have endorsed Warren, according to the campaign.) Maurice Mitchell, national director of the Working Families Party, introduced Warren on stage before her speech, attesting to her potential appeal beyond the group of highly educated voters that polling suggests are her most ardent supporters. \u201cElizabeth Warren has proposed a whole host of solutions that meet the full scale of the crises we face ... Elizabeth Warren has a plan for it!\u201d he said. \u201cBut crucially, Sen. Warren realizes that you need more than plans; we need to meet this moment with a movement of working people.\u201d Warren\u2019s show of force Monday evening was seemingly aimed at showcasing her strength in progressive bastions that were once Sanders\u2019 exclusive stomping grounds. The Vermont senator drew massive crowds to a rally in the same park in April 2016, claiming some 27,000 people attended. Warren\u2019s campaign said more than 20,000 people attended her rally, making it her largest to date. A spokesperson for the city Department of Parks and Recreation told HuffPost that officials believe the park\u2019s capacity is 10,000, and that Warren\u2019s event had a permit for 8,000 to 10,000 people. The city said it could not corroborate Warren\u2019s crowd estimate. Sanders supporters often argue that their candidate is a more consistent and more effective champion of grassroots social movements than Warren, whose most famous campaign slogan \u2015 \u201cI got a plan\u201d \u2015 evokes a more technocratic approach than Sanders\u2019 \u201cpolitical revolution.\u201d On Monday evening though, Warren also emphasized her commitment to building a grassroots movement capable of powering her plans to fruition. Warren turned the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory tale into a parable for inside-outside organizing \u2015 a term for policymaking that pairs mass mobilization with specialized legislative expertise and horse-trading. She described how one woman moved by the tragic spectacle of the fire was Frances Perkins, who went on to serve Franklin Delano Roosevelt as secretary of labor \u2015 both when he was governor of New York and later when he became president. Perkins is widely viewed as the architect of New York\u2019s first major labor reforms, as well as the social-democratic policies at the heart of the New Deal, including Social Security and a law establishing the first minimum wage. \u201cAs Frances Perkins put it: the Triangle Fire was \u2018the day the New Deal was born,\u2019\u201d Warren said. Warren went on to recount how the movements for the abolition of slavery, women\u2019s voting rights, labor rights, black civil rights and LGBTQ rights had all had to withstand skepticism of their power to effect change. But they persevered, she argued, just as Americans must now do to end corruption and restructure the economy. \u201cThey organized. They built a grassroots movement. They persisted,\u201d she said, referencing a famous complaint GOP Senate Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) made about her. \u201cAnd they changed the course of American history.\u201d Warren\u2019s campaign went the extra mile to paint her movement as an extension of Perkins\u2019 work. The podium from which she spoke was constructed by an all-female woodworking company run by a supporter using old barn wood from Perkins\u2019 historic home in Maine. Perkins\u2019 grandson,\u00a0Tomlin Perkins Coggeshall, procured the wood for the campaign and attended the rally. Some voters who supported Sanders in 2016 but showed up for Warren on Monday said they had gone with Sanders when it was a binary choice because they preferred him to Hillary Clinton. Astrid Clarke, a 49-year-old student and caregiver from Brooklyn\u2019s East New York neighborhood, thought Sanders was a better bet than Clinton in the general election last time. Now she \u201cloves\u201d Warren for her plans. \u201cI like the way it\u2019s people-centric and the way she can explain it so you know that it\u2019s hers,\u201d Clarke said. Other attendees said they had been Clinton supporters. One such Clinton supporter, Katie Carella, a 39-year-old children\u2019s publishing professional living in Manhattan, also emphasized Warren\u2019s \u201cplans.\u201d \u201cShe literally has a plan for everything,\u201d Carella said. \u201cI think we have to be asking for big structural changes in order to make any headway.\u201d This story has been updated with additional comments from Warren, and from a spokesperson for the city Department of Parks and Recreation.",

Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) closed the gap of support between her and former Vice President Joe Biden as the top contender for the presidential nomination in Iowa\u2019s Democratic caucuses, the first state in the country to vote in the race, according to the latest results of a key\u00a0poll in Iowa released Saturday night. In the Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom poll, Warren was the first-choice candidate with support from 22% of likely Democratic caucus attendees \u2015 up 7 percentage points since the last poll in June. Biden, who has maintained a slight edge over his opponents in other polling, fell 3 percentage points, bringing him to second place with 20% of their support. According to the Register, support for Biden has fallen in the Iowa polls since last year. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who is also running for the Democratic nomination, fell far behind both Warren and Biden in the Saturday\u2019s poll, taking third place at 11% \u2015 down 5 percentage points since June. All the other Democratic 2020 candidates polled in the single digits. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Kamala Harris (Calif.) rounded out the top five candidates, polling at 9% and 6% respectively. Despite Warren\u2019s and Biden\u2019s lead, there\u2019s still room for other contenders to crawl back up before the Iowa Democratic caucuses in February. Sixty-three percent of likely caucusgoers said in the poll that they hadn\u2019t fully made up their minds yet on their most favored candidates. Ann Selzer, the most respected pollster in the state, conducted the poll on 602 likely Democratic caucusgoers between Sept. 14 and Sept. 18. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. Earlier Saturday, all of the 2020 Democratic candidates came together for an annual Steak Fry fundraiser for the Polk County Democrats in Des Moines. CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article referred to Bernie Sanders as a Democratic senator from Vermont. Sanders was elected as an independent, though he caucuses with Democrats and is running for the Democratic presidential nomination.",

            "author": "Paul Blumenthal",
            "content": " Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has a\u00a0plan to crack down on lobbying in Washington: She wants to institute a progressive tax on \u201cexcessive\u201d lobbying expenditures. The proposal from the 2020 Democratic presidential candidate was first listed among her proposals to rein in Washington lobbying in September, but she is now providing extensive details. She would place a 35% tax on annual lobbying expenses above $500,000 for corporations and trade organizations. The tax rate will increase to 60% for expenses over $1 million and then 75% for spending exceeding $5 million. The income generated by the new tax will be placed in a \u201cLobbying Defense Trust\u201d that will be used to help fund congressional support agencies, such as a reinstated Office of Technology Assessment and the Congressional Budget Office, and heavily lobbied executive branch agencies. It would also create an Office of the Public Advocate to help regular people better influence government decision-making. The general idea is that a tax on lobbying creates a market-based mechanism to discourage corporate spending that seeks to gain from making back-room deals rather than creating wealth. Currently, there is a strong incentive for corporations and other special interests to spend heavily on lobbying to obtain beneficial treatment. All combined,\u00a0more than $3 billion was spent on reported lobbying expenditures in each of the past 10 years. Corporations make up the largest share of this spending. Total revenue from the proposed lobbying tax would have raised $10 billion over the past 10 years, according to an analysis provided by the Warren campaign. Fifty-one corporations would have been hit with the highest proposed tax rate of 75% for spending above $5 million. These companies and trade groups include the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Koch Industries, Exxon, Boeing, Microsoft, Pfizer, Walmart, Google and Facebook. The lobbying tax is one of many proposals Warren has introduced to crack down on corruption in Washington. She has proposed banning elected lawmakers and top officials from lobbying, expand the definition of lobbying to increase disclosure, ban foreign lobbying and ban lobbyists from donating or raising campaign money, among other things. The thinking behind Warren\u2019s tax on lobbying expenditures is slightly different \u2015 maybe even opposed to \u2015 the restrictions on lobbying usually considered by Congress. It can be argued that some of these restrictions have simply had the effect of making lobbying less transparent \u2015 as more people involved in the influence industry find loopholes to evade registering as lobbyists. The tax, however, is simply a mechanism to deter excessive lobbying \u2015 or at least impose a cost on it. This is what Luigi Zingales, a professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, thought when he proposed a tax on lobbying in his 2012 book, \u201dA Capitalism for the People.\u201d The Warren campaign consulted him when crafting the proposal. \u201cIf you tax lobbying in a progressive way then it reduces the influence of the largest companies on the important decisions,\u201d Zingales told The Economist in a 2012 interview. \u201cPeople lobby because there\u2019s a high return, but if you start taxing them and using some of that money to subsidise the opponents then it evens out.\u201d And that is Warren\u2019s thinking, too. \u201cMy new lobbying tax will make hiring armies of lobbyists significantly more expensive for the largest corporate influencers like Blue Cross Blue Shield, Boeing, and Comcast,\u201d Warren said in a post explaining the new tax policy. \u201cSure, this may mean that some corporations and industry groups will choose to reduce their lobbying expenditures, raising less tax revenue down the road \u2015 but in that case, all the better.\u201d",

            "content": " ROCK HILL, S.C. \u2015 Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren came to historically Black Clinton College in this suburb of Charlotte hoping to woo the voters she needs to complete a coalition that can claim the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination: African Americans. Warren\u2019s slow and steady rise in polling has been largely powered by white voters with college degrees, though more recent polls have shown gains across basically every demographic within the Democratic Party. But one of her biggest rivals for the nomination, former Vice President Joe Biden, still has a substantial lead among African American voters nationally and in this crucial state, the first in the south to cast its primary ballots. Compared to Iowa and New Hampshire \u2015 the overwhelmingly white states that vote first and second in the primary \u2015 Warren has spent little time in South Carolina. A local reporter noted it had been more than a month since her last public event in the state, and a candidate tracker from the Charleston Post and Courier shows her attending just 12 events in the state before Saturday, compared to 17 for Biden, and more than 30 for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, the third leading contender for the nomination. (Two African American candidates \u2015 California Sen. Kamala Harris and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker \u2015 lead the way with 36 and 39 events, respectively.) Warren\u2019s supporters in South Carolina say if she picks up her pace in visits to the state, African American voters will embrace her message of battling political corruption and raising taxes on the wealthy to fund universal child care and free public higher education. \u201cWe\u2019re still a high-touch community, even in a high-tech society,\u201d said state Sen. Wendy Brawley, an African American who predicted Warren could win the state. \u201cShe gets that she needs to show up where we are.\u201d Warren\u2019s stop at Clinton College showed the promises and challenges that face the former Harvard Law professor. The crowd of roughly 1,000 people was mostly white, and attendees of all races largely said they arrived at the event already in her corner. Warren\u2019s pitch barely varied from her standard stump speech: She walked voters through her famous policy plans while nearly totally avoiding two hot topics of the day \u2015 the possible impeachment of President Donald Trump and the details of her support for \u201cMedicare for All.\u201d She did note her higher education plan would funnel an additional $50 billion to historically Black colleges like Clinton. It\u2019s not new for Warren to be courting African Americans. Some Black progressive activists have been raving about her since at least April, and she\u2019s often held listening sessions with Black leaders as she tours the country. \u201cWhat I\u2019m doing is showing up and trying to talk to people about why I\u2019m in this fight, what\u2019s broken and how to fix it,\u201d Warren told reporters when asked about the majority-white crowd and what she needed to do to win over Black voters. But it does appears Warren is ready to invest more time and resources in the state. She\u2019s opening a campaign office in Rock Hill next week, her campaign said. But while the Warren team is eager to talk up the strength of their field operations in Iowa and New Hampshire, they declined to reveal how many staffers are on the ground in the Palmetto State. (In total, Warren has 300 staffers, and 60% of those are in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina or Nevada.) Biden\u2019s campaign has 41 staffers on the ground here. Brawley and other Warren backers in the state pointed to two Warren policies they believe could help court Black voters: Her education policies \u2014 including the elimination of student debt \u2014 could woo younger Black voters, while her proposal to make sure no family spends more than 7% of its income on childcare would attract Black women of all ages. \u201cIn my district, when you have grandparents raising their grands, when you have people working two jobs to keep a roof over their heads, not having childcare is a real issue,\u201d Brawley said. \u201cThese are pocketbook issues that really matter, that can change people\u2019s lives if we give them even a little attention.\u201d Casey McClure, a 26-year-old who said she \u201cloved everything about\u201d Warren, suggested Biden\u2019s lead in the state was due to a generation gap. \u201cIt\u2019s the older voters,\u201d she said, noting she had met Biden during one of his earlier stops in the state. \u201cShe needs to get the young people out to vote.\u201d But there are some signs the gap might be closing. \u201cI love Joe, but he might not be as spunky as he used to,\u201d said McClure\u2019s mother, who declined to give her name. A Quinnipiac University poll this week saw Warren essentially tied with Biden, and building beyond her base of college-educated white voters. She earned the support of 27% of Democrats and Democratic-learning voters nationally, compared to 25% for the former vice president, and 16% for Sanders. That included a lead among college-educated white voters, liberals, voters aged 35 to 50, and those making more than $50,000 a year. She also tied Biden among white voters without a college degree. Among white voters overall, Warren led Biden 33% to 23%. But among Black voters, Biden\u2019s advantage was substantial: Forty percent said they support him, while only 19% backed Warren. That still represents a marked improvement for Warren. In July, the same poll found just 4% of Black voters supported her, while 53% supported Biden. A CNN poll of South Carolina voters released Sunday morning, however, painted a much grimmer picture for Warren. The poll showed Biden earning 37% of the statewide vote to Warren\u2019s 16%, with Sanders at 11%. Among Black voters, Warren tallied just 4% of the vote compared to Biden\u2019s 45% and Sanders\u2019 13%. Biden and his allies have long viewed Black voters as a crucial backstop for his campaign. While Sanders turned in strong performances in Iowa and New Hampshire in 2016, his campaign floundered as Hillary Clinton, the party\u2019s eventual nominee, routed him among African Americans. The primary schedule is similar this year. Fourteen states are holding their primaries on March 3, so-called Super Tuesday, when more than 40% of the Democratic delegates are up for grabs. Six of those states, including delegate-rich Texas, are at least 10% Black. But state Rep. Kambrell Garvin, another Warren backer, suggested Biden and others shouldn\u2019t count on South Carolina\u2019s voters to stay static, and noted the results in Iowa and New Hampshire could sway their votes. \u201cI know South Carolina for some of the other campaigns is considered to be a firewall state, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a good strategy,\u201d he said. \u201cI think African-American voters are not monolithic, and I think they\u2019re going to make decisions that best suit their community.\u201d",

The two far-right conspiracy theorists who are already known for fraudulent claims \u2015 Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman \u2015\u00a0held a press conference\u00a0in Arlington, Virginia, featuring Kelvin Whelly, a former U.S. Marine in his mid-20s who claims he had a paid sexual affair with Warren, 70, that included bondage. Whelly claims he met Warren through a male escort website, Cowboys4Angels, and that their first tryst occurred on Aug. 8, 2018, in Massachusetts. But he offered no verifiable evidence to back up his story and Rolling Stone later reported that the Cowboys4Angels chief executive said, after checking his records, that \u201cthis guy never worked for me.\u201d Wohl and Burkman have made clear in the past their avid support for President Donald Trump, but even the pro-Trump\u00a0Daily Caller noted that Whelly had a hard time keeping a straight face while discussing his allegations. Warren, meanwhile, won the day with a witty response that embraced her \u201ccougar\u201d past, telling the world it made her who she is. Twitter users thought Warren\u2019s cougar tweet was the cat\u2019s meow: Wohl, though only 21, already has defined the term \u201ccheckered past.\u201d As a teenager, the Southern California native was involved in financial scams and banned for life by the National Futures Association. In August, new charges of securities fraud were filed against him.",

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) is standing firm in the face of scrutiny, and so are her supporters, who are sharing their own stories on Twitter of when they faced discrimination because of pregnancy. The 2020 presidential candidate tweeted Tuesday to reiterate that she had been edged out of her first teaching job when she became pregnant. She had been responding to unsubstantiated accusations that she had actually voluntarily resigned. \u201cWe can fight back by telling our stories. I tell mine on the campaign trail, and I hope to hear yours,\u201d she added. The conservative website Washington Free Beacon on Monday surfaced the minutes from an April 1971 board of education meeting showing a unanimous vote to extend Warren\u2019s teaching contract, two months before her exit in June. This does not necessarily contradict Warren\u2019s story, which is that her contract was renewed in April but that by June, when she was six months\u2019 pregnant, the principal \u201cshowed her the door.\u201d \u201cWhen someone calls you in and says the job that you\u2019ve been hired for for the next year is no longer yours \u2015 \u2018We\u2019re giving it to someone else\u2019 \u2015 I think that\u2019s being shown the door,\u201d Warren told CBS News on Monday. The Washington Free Beacon also cast doubt on Warren\u2019s account by noting she had once described her exit from the job differently in a 2007 interview, when she said:\u00a0\u201c[I] said, \u2018I don\u2019t think this is going to work out for me.\u2019 I was pregnant with my first baby, so I had a baby and stayed home for a couple of years.\u201d When asked to explain this, Warren told CBS she wasn\u2019t comfortable delving into the discrimination aspect publicly until later in her career. On Tuesday, after Warren\u2019s tweets, people on Twitter shared their own experiences of job discrimination due to pregnancy, or those of their friends and family. Here are some of those stories: Yep. In the late 90s, after 3 years of stellar reviews/promotions, I was suddenly fired within a month of telling my boss I was pregnant. They said I lied when I\u2019d called in sick one day (morning sickness), but went to visit family later. I was young+scared, so I didn\u2019t fight it. Do you have a similar story of job discrimination due to pregnancy? Get in touch with HuffPost\u2019s Amanda Terkel.",

In a 12-page memo, the Massachusetts senator outlined dozens of ways a Warren administration would \u201cfight for LGBTQ+ equality in solidarity with the leaders and organizers who have been at the helm from the very beginning.\u201d The measures include things like working to pass the Equality Act, which would extend civil rights protections to LGBTQ people, and amending the Religious Freedom Restoration Act to ensure it can\u2019t be used to discriminate against LGBTQ people. Warren said she would reverse the Trump administration policy that bans transgender people from serving in the military, as well as appoint a special envoy to the State Department to oversee LGBTQ human rights. \u201cI have opposed the Trump Administration\u2019s shameful ban on transgender service members from the start, and I will reverse it on Day One,\u201d the senator wrote in her plan. Warren\u2019s plan highlights the recent murders of transgender people in the U.S., most of them trans women of color, and states \u201cit is time for a president to say their names and honor their memory.\u201d The senator included a number of measures aimed at reducing violence against trans women of color, including reversing the Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s proposal to allow homeless shelters to deny transgender people access to their services. Warren released the plan ahead of her participation in a Thursday town hall hosted by CNN and the Human Rights Campaign that will focus on issues affecting the LGBTQ community. The senator is also expected to join the Las Vegas Pride Parade on Friday. Thursday\u2019s plan comes on the heels of a sweeping climate justice proposal Warren released on Wednesday and which reads as an ambitious blueprint of how to implement a Green New Deal. Like her LGBTQ plan, Warren\u2019s climate proposal looks at addressing the intersections of multiple issues \u2015 in this case how race and privilege play into conversations about the environment. \u201cJustice cannot be a secondary concern \u2015 it must be at the center of our response to climate change,\u201d Warren wrote in the memo.",

            "author": "",
            "content": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) unveiled a plan to reform federal judicial misconduct on Monday, a day after the one-year anniversary of Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s controversial confirmation to the Supreme Court. \u201cIt\u2019s time to ensure that judges do not hear cases where they have conflicts of interests, strengthen our nation\u2019s ethics rules for judges, and ensure accountability for judges who violate these rules,\u201d the 2020 presidential candidate wrote in her announcement of the plan for an impartial and ethical federal judiciary. Warren\u2019s plan includes closing a loophole that allows federal judges to escape investigations for misconduct when they resign from office or are elevated to the Supreme Court \u2015 a loophole that Warren has\u00a0railed against in the past. \u201cMy plan extends the authority of the Judicial Conference to former judges so that individuals under investigation cannot simply resign from the bench to avoid accountability,\u201d Warren said. \u201cThis provision would allow the judiciary to reopen the investigations into Alex Kozinski,\u00a0Maryanne Trump-Barry,\u00a0Brett Kavanaugh, and any other judge who benefited from this loophole.\u201d Kozinski was a judge on the federal 9th Circuit accused in 2017 by at least 15 law clerks of sexual misconduct. But, as Warren noted, the investigation into Kozinski\u2019s behavior was dropped when he retired. Trump-Barry, President Donald Trump\u2019s sister, resigned as a federal appellate judge in April, ending a probe into whether she violated judicial conduct rules by participating in the Trump family\u2019s alleged tax fraud schemes. When Kavanaugh rose to the Supreme Court, sexual assault and perjury complaints against him were dismissed. \u201cThe basic premise of our legal system is that every person is treated equally in the eyes of the law \u2015 including judges,\u201d Warren said on Monday. \u201cOur judiciary only functions properly when it lives up to this promise, and it risks eroding its legitimacy when the American people lose faith that judges are ethical and fair-minded.\u201d Warren also unveiled several proposals she hasn\u2019t mentioned publicly before. They include\u00a0prohibiting judges from deciding for themselves whether they should recuse themselves from a case due to conflict of interest;\u00a0requiring Supreme Court justices to give written explanations of their decisions when a party asks for a recusal; and\u00a0giving strong disciplinary tools to judicial ethics watchdogs, such as allowing them to take away nonvested pension benefits from judges. Warren\u2019s plan also proposes extending the Code of Conduct for United States Judges to the Supreme Court, which is currently not covered by such guidelines. Explaining the need for this provision, Warren cited the 83 ethics complaints\u00a0lodged against Kavanaugh that were dismissed upon his confirmation to the Supreme Court, as well as the lack of action after Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas\u00a0failed to disclose payments\u00a0his wife received from a conservative judicial activist group. \u201cBecause the Supreme Court is not covered by a Code of Conduct, no procedure exists to file new complaints\u201d against Kavanaugh, Warren said. She added that\u00a0\u201cquestions are often raised about the behavior of Supreme Court Justices, such as Justice Thomas\u2019s 13 years of financial disclosures that failed to list $690,000 in payments to his wife from the Heritage Foundation, a right-wing judicial activist group \u2015 but these actions are beyond the scope of current rules.\u201d Such lack of oversight, Warren said, has gone on for long enough. \u201cThese changes will not only allow us to ensure accountability for bad actors, including reopening inquiries into the conduct of offenders like Brett Kavanaugh,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThey will also hold the vast majority of judges who act in good faith to the highest ethical standards, and in the process, begin to restore accountability and trust in a fair and impartial federal judiciary.\u201d Warren\u2019s plan comes almost exactly a year after the Senate voted 50-48 to confirm Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, following explosive allegations that he sexually assaulted at least three women when he was younger.",

            "content": " Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren visited Michigan\u2019s most polluted ZIP code for the first time last week. The Massachusetts senator toured a community center and a school in the 48217 ZIP code in southwestern Detroit, where playgrounds sit sandwiched between the Great Lake State\u2019s only oil refinery and car manufacturing plants. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) guided the Sept. 29 visit, of which the campaign shared video with HuffPost. \u201cWhat\u2019s that smell?\u201d Warren says at the start of the video, turning to Tlaib in the backseat of an SUV. \u201cThat\u2019s what my people smell every day,\u201d the congresswoman says. \u201cI thought the smell was normal. I really did. I didn\u2019t realize that it was killing us.\u201d Just as gobbling fatty snacks at the Iowa State Fair is a rite of passage for top-tier presidential hopefuls, a pilgrimage to the 48217 is now becoming a touchstone for any contender who wants to be taken seriously on the nation\u2019s environment. Warren, citing a packed scheduled, passed on a chance to visit the area in July, when community activists invited all 20 candidates participating in the second round of Democratic primary debates in Detroit. Of the three who agreed to come \u2015 former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee \u2015 only Inslee, then running as the race\u2019s long-shot climate candidate, showed up. It was Inslee\u2019s third time in the 48217. Warren, a potential front-runner for the Democratic nomination, said she\u2019d adopt much of Inslee\u2019s book-length stack of climate proposals when the Evergreen State governor dropped out to run for reelection at home in August. Now she\u2019s covering the same ground, visiting the kind of frontline community that could lend her credibility as her campaign courts older Black voters, a key demographic to winning the nomination. The area, crisscrossed by highways and choked by air emissions, made a powerful backdrop for Warren just days after releasing a meaty proposal to restore union membership. The policy outline came out just as the United Auto Workers union was preparing for a long-haul strike against Detroit giant General Motors. After photographing legally questionable flaring \u2015 when excess gas is vented into the air and burned \u2015 at the Marathon Petroleum Corp. refinery next door to the Kemeny Recreation Center, Warren drove by Salina Elementary School, where Tlaib says officials only recently installed air filtration systems to protect students from cancer-causing particulate matter spewed from the neighboring AK Steel plant. \u201cThese big corporations have enough muscle with the government that they squeeze it to get tax breaks. So the cost of running these schools and keeping these roads paved fall disproportionately on you,\u201d Warren says to a trio of activists. \u201cSo you\u2019re not only paying the cost in terms of what you breathe, what your children breathe, your bodies \u2015 you\u2019re also paying the cost out of pocket.\u201d",

            "content": " Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren released a sweeping climate justice plan on Wednesday morning, vowing to ramp up research on the health effects of pollution and discourage the transfer of public water services to for-profit companies. The 12-page memo marks the Massachusetts senator\u2019s eighth climate-related proposal since launching a presidential campaign built on an ambitious slate of policy plans at the start of the year. The latest proposal collects much of Warren\u2019s existing ideas on improving racial equity and reducing pollution and reframes them in what looks like an ambitious, nearly 5,900-word blueprint on how to implement a Green New Deal. \u201cJustice cannot be a secondary concern \u2015 it must be at the center of our response to climate change,\u201d Warren wrote in the memo. \u201cThe Green New Deal commits us to a \u2018just transition\u2019 for all communities and all workers. But we won\u2019t create true justice by cleaning up polluted neighborhoods and tweaking a few regulations at the EPA.\u201d The document borrows heavily from the plan laid out by former climate candidate Jay Inslee, who quit the Democratic presidential primary in August to run for reelection as Washington\u2019s governor, including efforts to quantify pollution inequity between communities and apply that data to decisions on where to invest Green New Deal money. Warren also proposes turning the White House\u00a0Council on Environmental Quality, a currently sleepy office tasked with coordinating public health policy across federal agencies, into an environmental justice hub. The Warren plan offers fewer wonky details on which agencies should do what work than the Inslee proposal did. But notably included in the senator\u2019s release are calls to increase research funding at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and to overhaul drinking water infrastructure, putting an end to the privatization of water delivery. Under her administration, Warren would \u201cfully fund\u201d the CDC\u2019s \u201cenvironmental health programs, such as childhood lead poisoning prevention, and community health investigations\u201d and would \u201cprovide additional grant funding for independent research into environmental health effects.\u201d Her campaign declined to share an exact dollar figure. It\u2019s a relatively novel idea to include the CDC in a campaign climate plan, something the other leading environmental champions in the race have omitted so far. Yet it\u2019s likely to be popular. In February, representatives from four dozen public health groups sent a letter to House lawmakers pleading for an increase in federal funding for the CDC\u2019s \u201ccritically underfunded\u201d lead and climate programs. The CDC is the fourth-most favorably viewed federal agency and has some of the most bipartisan support, a Pew Research Center poll found in September. Yet the CDC\u2019s operating budget fell nearly $1 million between the 2018 and 2019 fiscal years. Warren\u2019s plan goes beyond just researching the effects of lead poisoning. Citing the recent lead contaminations in the drinking water of Flint, Michigan, and Newark, New Jersey, she said her administration would \u201cend decades of disinvestment and privatization of our nation\u2019s water system \u2015 our government at every level should invest in safe, affordable drinking water for all of us.\u201d Ramping up federal spending on water infrastructure is a staple of Democratic campaigns at this point, particularly as Newark\u2019s former mayor, now-Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), is running for the presidential nomination. But curtailing the transfer of control of public services from government agencies to private companies is another issue altogether. The private water industry serves 73 million Americans, according to National Association of Water Companies data. For-profit water services put public health at risk, a 66-page paper by University of Louisville law professor Craig Anthony Arnold argues, because the profit motive incentivizes companies to provide better services to customers who pay more and to maintain infrastructure with an eye to the length of the firm\u2019s contract. Detroit\u2019s debt-choked public utility threatened to shut off water to nearly 17,500 households that were behind on bills last year, only to decrease the shutoff rate 70% this year. In the timing of the 2018 shutoffs, just as the city was looking to privatize its utility, the left-wing think tank Centre for Research on Globalization saw\u00a0an effort to streamline a troubled facility before selling it off to profiteers. Other cities are actively opposing such privatization. Last November, Baltimore became the first big city in the United States to ban water privatization with an amendment to its charter. Wednesday\u2019s proposal did not make clear whether a Warren White House would take explicit steps to discourage municipalities from switching to private water. But the campaign said an influx of federal funding to overhaul water infrastructure should make switching to private water services far less appealing. Income and race are strong indicators of how much pollution exposure Americans can expect to face. Black neighborhoods, on average, have air that\u2019s 48% more polluted than that in white neighborhoods, an NAACP report found last year, and Black Americans are 75% more likely to live in neighborhoods abutting industrial sites. The journal Environmental Research published a study last year that determined Black, Hispanic and poor students face the highest risks of inhaling toxic pollutants in crumbling schools across the country.",

The Democratic presidential candidate is running an ad that begins with \u201cbreaking news\u201d\u00a0that then goes on to make the (fake) claim that the company and its CEO Mark Zuckerberg \u201cjust endorsed Donald Trump for re-election\u201d in 2020. Check it out here: \u201cYou\u2019re probably shocked, and you might be thinking, \u2018how could this possibly be true?\u2019\u201d Warren\u2019s ad continues. \u201cWell, it\u2019s not. (Sorry.) But what Zuckerberg *has* done is given Donald Trump free rein to lie on his platform \u2015 and then to pay Facebook gobs of money to push out their lies to American voters.\u201d \u201cIf Trump tries to lie in a TV ad, most networks will refuse to air it. But Facebook just cashes Trump\u2019s checks,\u201d it adds. \u201cFacebook already helped elect Donald Trump once. Now, they\u2019re deliberately allowing a candidate to intentionally lie to the American people. It\u2019s time to hold Mark Zuckerberg accountable.\u201d Facebook drew ire this week for refusing to pull an ad that makes false accusations about former Vice President Joe Biden, who is one of Warren\u2019s opponents in the Democratic presidential nominating contest. The platform has also faced heavy scrutiny over the\u00a0role it played in the widespread dissemination of misinformation\u00a0about candidates including Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election. In audio that leaked last week, Zuckerberg said he was prepared to \u201cgo to the mat and ... fight\u201d lawmakers such as Warren who are keen to break up big technology companies. Warren, meanwhile, this week called out Facebook\u2019s \u201cincredible power to affect elections and our national debate\u201d in a lengthy Twitter thread, below: Nick Clegg, the former deputy prime minister of the U.K. who is now Facebook\u2019s vice president of global affairs and communications, said last month that the company didn\u2019t believe \u201cit\u2019s an appropriate role for us to referee political debates and prevent a politician\u2019s speech from reaching its audience and being subject to public debate and scrutiny.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s why Facebook exempts politicians from our third-party fact-checking program. We have had this policy on the books for over a year now, posted publicly on our site under our eligibility guidelines,\u201d he added. \u201cThis means that we will not send organic content or ads from politicians to our third-party fact-checking partners for review. However, when a politician shares previously debunked content including links, videos and photos, we plan to demote that content, display related information from fact-checkers, and reject its inclusion in advertisements.\u201d",

She cited the lyrics of a song she learned in church:\u00a0\u201cThey are yellow, black and white. They are precious in his sight Jesus loves all the children of the world.\u201d She said that, although her exposure to same-sex couples was gradual during her upbringing in Oklahoma, the hatefulness that could be directed at the gay community shocked her, particularly from people of faith. Warren also tackled how Democrats could expect to pass the Equality Act, medical care for transgender people in the military and correctional facilities, cost-reduction for HIV medications, and decriminalizing HIV transmission, among other topics.

She told MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow that if the shoe was on the other foot, however, those same lawmakers would no doubt react very differently. As an example, she offered a hypothetical. \u201cImagine, Rachel, that you had one of the Democratic nominees for 2020 on your show and that person said, \u2018Y\u2019know, the only other adversary of ours, who\u2019s anywhere near as good as the Russians, is China. So why should Russia have all the fun? And since Russia is clearly backing Republicans, why don\u2019t we ask China to back us?\u2019\u201d Then, she got even more specific, using Trump\u2019s own words from when he called on Russia to hack her, just paraphrased slightly. \u201cChina, if you\u2019re listening, why don\u2019t you get Trump\u2019s tax returns?\u201d Clinton said in this hypothetical scenario. \u201cI\u2019m sure our media would richly reward you.\u201d During a 2016 news conference, Trump infamously said:\u00a0\u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.\u201d Clinton said that, according to special counsel Robert Muller\u2019s report, such a call wouldn\u2019t be considered criminal conspiracy even if China hacked the IRS and delivered those returns to a WikiLeaks-like organization because it took place in the open.\u00a0That\u2019s what happened in 2016 when Russia hacked email accounts of people close to Clinton and delivered the messages to WikiLeaks after Trump openly called on them to hack his rival. \u201cJust saying that shows how absurd the situation we find ourselves in,\u201d Clinton said. She said that Republicans like to mention her whenever they want a distraction from real issues, such as Russian interference in the 2016 election and Trump\u2019s obstruction. \u201cThat\u2019s the real story. That\u2019s what they don\u2019t want the American people thinking about,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cSo when in doubt, say something wild about me.\u201d Clinton also noted that Trump\u2019s obsession with her meant that she was \u201cliving rent-free\u201d inside the president\u2019s brain. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not a very nice place to be, I can tell you that,\u201d she added.

The 2016 presidential candidate broke the news in a tweet Saturday, mourning his passing. \u201cWe lost my brother Tony last night,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to find words, my mind is flooded with memories of him today. When he walked into a room he\u2019d light it up with laughter. He was kind, generous, & a wonderful husband to Megan & father to Zach, Simon, & Fiona. We\u2019ll miss him very much.\u201d Rodham was born in 1954 to Hugh Rodham and Dorothy Howell, and was the youngest of their three children. Like his sister, Rodham also became politically involved, working for the Democratic National Convention in 1992 as then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton launched his successful presidential bid. In 2007, Rodham joined Hillary Clinton\u2019s first presidential campaign. Hillary Clinton appears to have had a sometimes strained relationship with Rodham, who along with his brother Hugh had jokingly become known to Clinton\u2019s White House aides as \u201cThe Brothers Rodham,\u201d according to Politico. In 2015, the outlet reported that during Clinton\u2019s time as secretary of state, Rodham pushed the agency to approve visas. But that wasn\u2019t all. In 1999, a Washington Post article detailed the brothers\u2019 \u201cembarrassing business venture\u201d in which they attempted to turn a profit from harvesting hazelnuts in the former Soviet republic of Georgia. The enterprise reportedly angered then-national security adviser Sandy Berger as Aslan Abashidze, a local politician in the port city of Batumi, claimed it was an indication of \u201cpolitical support\u201d from Bill Clinton himself. Abashidze was a rival of then-Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze, a U.S. ally who became irked as a result. Eventually, Berger pressured the Rodham brothers into dropping the project altogether. In 2001, The New York Times revealed\u00a0that during the end of the Clinton administration, Rodham had convinced his brother-in-law, who was serving as president, to override Justice Department objections and pardon Edgar Allen Gregory Jr. and wife Vonna Jo Gregory, a Tennessee couple found guilty of bank fraud. A congressional probe subsequently discovered that the duo had paid Rodham nearly $250,000 for work as a \u201cconsultant\u201d while they attempted to secure the pardon. In 2016, Rodham briefly appeared with Hillary Clinton during a campaign\u00a0visit to Scranton, Pennsylvania, where their father was born and raised. Rodham had three children, two with wife Megan Madden, whom he married in 2005, four years after his divorce from wife Nicole Boxer, the daughter of former California Sen. Barbara Boxer. Rodham and Boxer share a son, Zach. The cause of death has not yet been made public. Clarification: Language has been amended to reflect more accurately the parentage of Rodham\u2019s children.",

Trump\u2019s targeting of Clinton during Tuesday\u2019s rally led to widespread mockery on Twitter, where many people accused him of failing to update his material. Former Rep. David Jolly\u00a0(R-Fla.) bashed Trump for delivering a \u201ctired, lazy, undisciplined political message focused on the grievance politics that elected him in the first place.\u201d",

It should be something undertaken in a really serious ... way based on evidence,\u201d she continued. Though some Democrats, including 2020 presidential contenders Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Kamala Harris (Calif.), have made concrete statements in support of impeaching Trump, Pelosi has taken a more measured approach. In a letter to her colleagues Monday, Pelosi acknowledged efforts to seek impeachment against the president in light of the \u201chighly unethical and unscrupulous behavior\u201d conducted by Trump, as laid out in the Mueller report. \u201cAs you know, last Thursday\u2019s release of the redacted Mueller Report has caused a public outcry for truth and accountability,\u201d Pelosi said in her letter.\u00a0\u201cWhile our views range from proceeding to investigate the finding of the Mueller report or proceeding directly to impeachment, we all firmly agree that we should proceed down a path of finding the truth.\u201d Clinton on Tuesday compared a potential Trump impeachment to the impeachment of President Richard Nixon in 1974. Many public hearings involving Nixon administration officials took place before the House initiated impeachment proceedings against him, she noted. As a staff attorney for the House Judiciary Committee at the time, Clinton researched the historical grounds for impeachment and helped draft a memo on what constitutes high crimes and misdemeanors. \u201cI have a kind of weird personal history about impeachment,\u201d Clinton said during the Time summit. \u201cIt took several years for the slow acquisition and the publication of information to show the level of corruption and obstruction that was existing in [the Nixon] White House. ... By the end of it, the evidence was overwhelming.\u201d Clinton said the Mueller report \u201ccould not be more explicit\u201d in laying out evidence that Trump obstructed justice, adding that \u201cany other person who had engaged in those acts would certainly have been indicted\u201d if not for the Justice Department determination that a sitting president cannot be indicted. Nonetheless, she said, Congress must investigate and examine the evidence \u201cas objectively as possible\u201d before deciding to move forward with impeachment. \u201cI think Nancy is right to be cautious about making sure whatever is done in this Congress is more in accord with the very careful approach of 1973 and \u201974,\u201d Clinton said, referring to the Nixon impeachment proceedings. \u201cYou don\u2019t put impeachment on the table as the only item on the table. ... Instead, you say, \u2018We are going to proceed with the seriousness this demands.\u2019\u201d",

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.), Rashida Tlaib (Mich.), Ayanna Pressley (Mass.) and Ilhan Omar (Minn.). All four are women of color, but only one \u2014 Omar \u2014 was born outside of the United States. The lawmaker was born in Somalia and immigrated to the U.S. when she was a child. Clinton has become a vocal and noted critic of the president since her defeat in 2016, lambasting his frequent invocations of her name, chastising him for spreading \u201csexist trash\u201d and accusing the Trump administration of conducting \u201cdespicable\u201d acts. She has vowed to \u201ccontinue to speak out and fight for our basic rights,\u201d even if it sometimes irks those in Washington. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) also came to her colleagues\u2019 defense on Sunday, accusing the president of \u201cxenophobic comments meant to divide our nation.\u201d Republicans, on the other hand, have largely stayed silent. The hosts of \u201cFox & Friends\u201d went so far as to applaud Trump\u2019s remarks on Sunday. Despite the outcry, Trump doubled down on his remarks later that evening, saying it was \u201cso sad to see the Democrats sticking up for people who speak so badly of our Country.\u201d \u201cTheir disgusting language and the many terrible things they say about the United States must not be allowed to go unchallenged,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cIf the Democrat Party wants to continue to condone such disgraceful behavior, then we look even more forward to seeing you at the ballot box in 2020!\u201d",

On Friday, The Washington Post debunked the footage as a hit job, though its origins remain unclear.\u00a0A version shared on a Facebook page called Politics WatchDog continued to remain available with 2.6 million views as of Saturday, and the social media platform has no plans to take it down. Though the company has vowed to combat the sharing of fake news on its site, in a statement to The Guardian, a company spokesperson said it was trying to uphold free speech by leaving the edited clip up: There\u2019s a tension here: we work hard to find the right balance between encouraging free expression and promoting a safe and authentic community, and we believe that reducing the distribution of inauthentic content strikes that balance. But just because something is allowed to be on Facebook doesn\u2019t mean it should get distribution. In other words, we allow people to post it as a form of expression, but we\u2019re not going to show it at the top of News Feed. On Twitter, the video was shared by the president\u2019s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, who later deleted his post then tweeted out an unintelligible comment\u00a0appearing to defend his decision to spread the footage. Trump himself tweeted a separate video of Pelosi on Wednesday, titling it, \u201cPelosi stammers through news conference.\u201d The Post determined the clip had been selectively edited, but it is still on the president\u2019s page.",

On Tuesday, the singer tweeted a short clip of various 2016 presidential hopefuls, including Clinton and Sen.

However, the video features Lizzo\u2019s song \u201cTruth Hurts\u201d as the anthem. \u201cWhy men great \u2019til they gotta be great? Woo,\u201d Lizzo sings as Clinton, Sanders and others hold their hands over their hearts. The next day, Clinton responded to the tweet with the opening of the song\u2019s first verse: \u201cI just took a DNA test, turns out...\u201d The full lyric is \u201cI just took a DNA test, turns out I\u2019m 100% that bitch.\u201d Sadly, Clinton did not tweet that part. It\u2019s not clear why Clinton (or her team) chose to respond to this tweet in this way, but relating with singers and rappers seems to be all the rage these days. Rapper Cardi B has long been an admirer of Sanders, and last week the senator\u2019s team released a video of her interviewing him about police reform, minimum wage and health care. And earlier this month, the team of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) tweeted a line from \u201cTruth Hurts\u201d in response to a now-unavailable tweet. So, if this country is looking for something to unite both parties, it seems our biggest hope may lie in Lizzo.",

Again,\u201d she dryly tweeted \u2014 clearly referencing Russia\u2019s role in the 2016 presidential election. Clinton attached a clip of Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani\u2019s meltdown in a CNN interview Thursday when he said that \u201cof course\u201d he called on Ukrainian officials recently to investigate\u00a0Biden, after initially denying it. Clinton\u2019s attack was one of several in the wake of a Wall Street Journal article published Friday which reported that Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky \u201cabout eight times\u201d in a July phone call to\u00a0work with Giuliani on an investigation of\u00a0the former vice president\u2019s actions as well as those of his son, Hunter. Giuliani has claimed that Biden worked when he was vice president to shield a Ukrainian energy company linked to Hunter from a corruption probe. A Ukrainian official said earlier this year there was no evidence of any wrongdoing by either Biden. Trump\u2019s request for a Ukrainian investigation into the Bidens is part of a secret complaint filed against the president by a whistleblower in the intelligence community, The New York Times reported Friday. Trump hasn\u2019t denied pressing Zelensky to investigate the Bidens. He has described the call with Zelensky as \u201cbeautiful,\u201d and said it \u201cdoesn\u2019t matter what I discussed.\u201d The possibility of a president leveraging the power of the U.S. government on a foreign country to probe a political rival to help his reelection has begun to trigger calls for impeachment. Former Texas Rep.\u00a0Beto O\u2019Rourke, former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development\u00a0Julian Castro, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker\u00a0and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren appeared to be the first of the Democratic presidential contenders to call for Trump\u2019s impeachment over the matter on Friday. Like Clinton, both O\u2019Rourke and Warren referred to Russian interference in the 2016 election. Rep. Joe Kennedy (D-Mass.) said Trump should be impeached if he is blocking the whistleblower complaint from being released to congressional investigators. Richard Painter, who served as chief White House ethics lawyer in the George W. Bush administration, tweeted: \u201cImpeach NOW.\u201d",

And the people who are targeted to receive them still believe them,\u201d she said. Facebook did not respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment. According to Legum\u2019s newsletter, Popular Information, the Trump campaign has used stock photo models to offer phony endorsements in Facebook videos. The attractive models smile as voiceovers offer support for the president. In a NowThis feature on his reporting, Legum said that the campaign has also used Facebook ads to ask voters to make an immediate donation in order to enter contests to win items such as a signed \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat. The contests are said to have enrollment deadlines of 11:59 p.m. on that given day \u2015 but they actually are promoted for multiple days or even weeks, Legum said. The ads are designed, he said, to \u201cscam\u201d Trump supporters. The often politically divisive sentiments pushed by Trump\u2019s ads have also raised concerns. Following the shooting last month in which a gunman targeting Mexicans killed 22 people in El Paso, Texas \u2015 having allegedly acted on a white supremacist manifesto decrying a \u201cHispanic invasion\u201d \u2015 a review of Trump\u2019s campaign ads showed he used the same language to describe immigration. Earlier this year, about 2,200 ads claimed an \u201cinvasion\u201d was taking place, many of them warning social media users that \u201cillegal immigration is a serious threat to our country.\u201d Clarification: This story has been updated to clarify that the conference was held at George Washington University but was not sponsored by the school.",

            "content": " Former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 campaign is asking television news executives to stop booking attorney Rudy Giuliani, who is spreading \u201cfalse, debunked conspiracy theories on behalf of\u201d his client,\u00a0President Donald Trump. The request came in a letter that top aides Anita Dunn and Kate Bedingfield sent to anchors, producers and senior leadership at ABC, CNN, CBS, NBC, MSNBC and Fox News. \u201cWhile you often fact check his statements in real time during your discussions, that is no longer enough,\u201d a copy of the memo obtained by HuffPost read. \u201cBy giving him your air time, you are allowing him to introduce increasingly unhinged, unfounded and desperate lies into the national conversation.\u201d Continuing, the campaign slammed Giuliani as a Trump surrogate who \u201chas demonstrated that he will knowingly and willingly lie in order to advance his own narrative.\u201d \u201cGiuliani is not enlightening your viewers in any way. He\u2019s not offering a unique or informed perspective. He\u2019s certainly not introducing new facts, since his relationship with the truth is casual at best.\u201d The message follows revelations that Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a July phone call to assist Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr with a probe of Biden and his son, based on unfounded corruption allegations. The conversation has fueled an impeachment inquiry into the president, who has been accused of soliciting election help from a foreign government. During the elder Biden\u2019s vice presidency, Hunter Biden worked on the board of Burisma Holdings, a Ukraine-based energy firm from which he made up to\u00a0$50,000 per month,\u00a0according to The New York Times. At the time, Joe Biden was pushing \u2015 along with the international community \u2015 for the ouster of the country\u2019s then-prosecutor general Viktor Shokin, who was leading a corruption probe of Burisma. However, there remains no evidence that Joe Biden was aware of the investigation. Furthermore, in May, Yuriy Lutsenko, one of Shokin\u2019s successors who has since left the position,\u00a0told Bloomberg News,\u00a0\u201cHunter Biden did not violate any Ukrainian laws \u2015 at least as of now, we do not see any wrongdoing.\u201d In spite of that, Giuliani has made television appearances as recently as Sunday to promulgate his theory and gin up suspicion over the Democratic presidential candidate. He has also claimed that Ukraine, rather than Russia, was responsible for the 2016 hack into the Democratic National Committee\u2019s server. U.S. intelligence agencies have already determined that it was indeed Russia that perpetrated the breach. The latter allegation prompted Trump\u2019s own former homeland security adviser and current ABC News analyst Tom Bossert to speak out against Giuliani on air Sunday, stating the claim has \u201cno validity.\u201d \u201cAt this point I am deeply frustrated with what he and the legal team is doing in repeating that debunked theory to the president,\u201d Bossert said. Now, Biden\u2019s campaign is urging news outlets to cut Giuliani off, warning that he is pushing \u201coutlandish falsehoods and disinformation in the knowledge that it is hard for the corrections to catch up.\u201d \u201cYour obligation is to provide the American people with an informed, fact-based and responsible coverage and debate of critical issues.\u201d In a statement to The Daily Beast, which broke the story, Giuliani said the letter \u201csounds like the usual left wing censorship,\u201d arguing that \u201ceverything\u201d he says is backed up by \u201caffidavits and statements\u201d and that the left is engaged in a cover-up. Trump\u2019s reelection campaign manager, Brad Parscale, also weighed in on Twitter, asking whether the same request could be made of news organizations regarding the booking of Democrats, accusing the left of pushing \u201choaxes.\u201d",

            "content": " Former Vice President Joe Biden would seek legislation requiring owners of assault weapons to either sell their guns or register them with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, his campaign said Wednesday ahead of a major gun violence policy forum. Biden\u2019s proposal does not go as far as some of his Democratic rivals. Former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke has pushed for a mandatory buyback of all assault weapons, and Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts have both argued for a federal gun licensing system. Biden and other leading Democratic 2020 presidential contenders are set to speak at a forum in Las Vegas sponsored by the gun control groups Giffords and March For Our Lives. The forum is scheduled two years and one day after the deadliest mass shooting in American history, which killed 58 people at a country music festival in the city. Biden\u2019s plan, which would need to pass a potentially divided Congress, would offer a voluntary buyback program for assault weapons. Gun owners who don\u2019t want to sell their weapons could register them with the ATF under the National Firearms Act. Owners are already required to register machine guns and short-barreled rifles under the law, which the Biden campaign says limits how frequently the weapons are used in criminal activity. \u201cThe way the vice president approaches this is \u2018first things first,\u2019\u201d a Biden adviser, speaking on condition of anonymity, told reporters. \u201cWe have a comprehensive plan to deal with the problem of assault weapons.\u201d Biden would also push for universal background checks for gun purchasers, legislation barring all online gun and ammunition sales, incentives for states to enact red flag laws and gun licensing programs, limits on gun purchases to one per individual per month, and laws to make adults criminally liable for negligently giving a minor access to a firearm and to require gun owners to safely store their weapons. Biden has a long history on gun violence. He was chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee when the existing background check system passed in 1993, and when the assault weapons ban (no longer in effect) passed in 1994. In 2014, as vice president, he served as the point person for the Obama administration\u2019s unsuccessful push for tougher gun laws following the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Biden\u2019s campaign is also proposing the creation of a task force to \u201cstudy rampant online sexual harassment, stalking, and threats, including revenge porn and deepfakes \u2014 and the connection between this harassment, mass shootings, extremism and violence against women.\u201d The plan also takes aim at a favorite proposal of some conservatives in response to school shootings. A theoretical Biden administration would bar the use of federal funds to train teachers on how to use guns.",

            "content": " Former Vice President Joe Biden raised $15.2 million over the last three months, his campaign announced on Thursday. \u201cToday\u2019s fundraising totals put the campaign in a strong position as we enter the fall,\u201d Greg Schultz, Biden\u2019s campaign manager, said in a statement. \u201cThe question any campaign faces at this point is whether or not you have the resources to compete in early states and sustain your efforts beyond. Our campaign unequivocally does and builds on our strength each week.\u201d The campaign also noted that 56% of donors were new to the campaign, which it said indicates Biden\u2019s staying power and popularity in the race to unseat President Donald Trump. The total is notably less than that of at least two of his fellow candidates, although Biden is still the frontrunner in many polls. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has so far raised the most out of any 2020 Democrat, picking up $25.3 million in the third quarter. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg raised more than $19 million, and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) garnered $11.6 million. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who rose dramatically in polls over the summer, has not yet released her third quarter fundraising numbers. Biden has been at the center of the unfolding scandal over Trump\u2019s call with the leader of Ukraine earlier this year. During that conversation, Trump repeatedly pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, who served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company. Before the call, Trump ordered his administration to withhold military aid from the country. Democrats have cast the conversation as an unprecedented move by a president to solicit political help from a foreign power as part of a quid pro quo, although Trump has rejected those claims. It\u2019s unclear if the drama will damage Biden\u2019s chances in the presidential race.\u00a0Neither Biden has been accused of wrongdoing in the matter, and House Democrats have launched an impeachment inquiry into the president\u2019s behavior. Biden has gone on the offensive in recent days, firing back at the White House for waging what he called a campaign of \u201clies, smears, distortions and name calling.\u201d During a speech to supporters on Thursday, Biden continued to lambaste Trump but said he remained optimistic about this chances in 2020. \u201cDon\u2019t compare me to the Almighty, compare me to the alternative,\u201d Biden said, according to a pool report, before he went on to cite polls from Ohio and Michigan that put him above Trump. \u201cI thought those polls are wrong until Trump decided to go after me \u2015 so now I know they\u2019re right.\u201d Trump, for his part, had a very good financial summer. His reelection campaign and the Republican National Committee raised a combined $125 million in the third quarter, a figure so large many Democratic leaders warned that the road ahead will not be easy. The two groups currently have more than $156 million cash on hand, double what former President Barack Obama and the Democratic National Committee had at this point before the 2012 election, Politico noted.",

And you\u2019re not going to destroy my family. I don\u2019t care how much money you spend or how dirty the attacks get.\u201d Last week, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) announced a formal impeachment inquiry in response to a whistleblower complaint\u00a0about a July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The complaint said the call revealed Trump \u201cpressuring a foreign country to investigate one of the President\u2019s main domestic political rivals.\u201d According to the White House\u2019s summary of the July call, Trump asked Zelensky to work with his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and U.S. Attorney General William Barr to investigate Biden, a front-runner in the Democratic race, as well as his son Hunter, based on unfounded corruption allegations. Trump has accused Biden of seeking the removal of a prosecutor in Ukraine when he was Obama\u2019s vice president, supposedly in order to impede an investigation into the Ukrainian gas company on whose board his son was serving. Ukrainian authorities have cleared Biden of any wrongdoing. Earlier Wednesday, Trump repeatedly evaded questions from reporters about comments he made about Biden during the July phone call, including a question on what exactly he had wanted Zelensky to do about the former vice president and his son. \u201cLook, Biden and his son are stone-cold crooked,\u201d Trump claimed amid a long-winded response. \u201cYou know it, and so do we.\u201d Biden said Trump\u2019s \u201cscheme\u201d involving Ukraine was because the president was \u201cafraid.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s afraid of just how badly I would beat him next November,\u201d Biden said, according to his prepared remarks. Earlier this week, Biden\u2019s campaign urged TV news outlets to stop putting Giuliani on the air, saying the president\u2019s personal lawyer was spreading \u201cfalse, debunked conspiracy theories\u201d about Hunter Biden\u2019s dealings in Ukraine during Biden\u2019s vice presidency. Last week, Joe Biden said he was in favor of impeaching Trump if the president refuses to comply with Congress\u2019s investigations. After the release of the White House summary of Trump\u2019s July call with Ukraine, Biden called the president\u2019s actions \u201can impeachable offense.\u201d Biden joined the rest of the leading Democratic candidates who had been calling for Trump\u2019s impeachment for months. Sens. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) called for Trump\u2019s impeachment in late spring in response to special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s April report and May public statement about his investigation into Russia\u2019s 2016 election interference and possible obstruction of justice by Trump. In his Nevada remarks Wednesday, Biden repeated his description of Trump\u2019s actions as an \u201cabuse of power\u201d and said the president placed his \u201cown personal gain ahead of the public good.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not backing down. And I\u2019m not going to be distracted by the lies, smears, distortions and name-calling,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI\u2019m going to let Congress do its job on impeachment.\u201d",

            "author": "Dominique Mosbergen",
            "content": " Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden\u2019s campaign has excoriated The New York Times for helping to spread what it described as a \u201cbaseless conspiracy theory\u201d advanced by President Donald Trump and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, and for prioritizing sensationalism over \u201ctruth and judiciousness.\u201d \u201cAre you truly blind to what you got wrong in 2016,\u201d Biden\u2019s deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield wrote in a Wednesday letter addressed to the Times\u2019 executive editor Dean Baquet. \u201cOr are you deliberately continuing policies that distort reality for the sake of controversy and the clicks that accompany it?\u201d The letter, obtained by Oliver Darcy, a senior media reporter at CNN, accused the Times of \u201cactive participation\u201d in the \u201csmear campaign\u201d against Biden concocted by Trump and his allies. The Trump camp has been pushing a conspiracy theory for months about Biden\u2019s alleged corruption in his dealings with Ukraine. They claim Biden, during his tenure as vice president, withheld $1 billion in aid to Ukraine to compel the country\u2019s firing of a top prosecutor in order to protect his son, Hunter Biden. While it\u2019s true that Biden, following a foreign policy position of the Obama administration, urged Ukrainian leaders to oust the prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, there\u2019s no evidence that he did it to help his son. Despite the facts, the Times still disseminated this conspiracy theory, Bedingfield said. She pointed specifically to a\u00a0widely criticized\u00a0article\u00a0published in the paper on May 1 that said in its headline that Biden was facing \u201cconflict of interest questions\u201d regarding Ukraine that were \u201cbeing promoted by Trump and allies.\u201d The story, written by reporter Ken Vogel and freelance writer Iuliia Mendel, described how Biden had appealed to Ukrainian leaders for Shokin\u2019s ouster and how his son Hunter Biden had a \u201cstake in the outcome\u201d as he was on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company that had been in Shokin\u2019s \u201csights.\u201d Vogel\u2019s and Mendel\u2019s story included a line stating that \u201cno evidence has surfaced that the former vice president intentionally tried to help his son by pressing\u201d for Shokin\u2019s dismissal. However, as The Washington Post\u2019s Erik Wemple pointed out at the time, that caveat comes 19 paragraphs into the story. \u201cIn those first 19 paragraphs is a knot of details bound to be mangled by cable-news hosts and pundits in the coming months,\u201d Wemple, the Post\u2019s media critic, wrote in a column. In her letter to Baquet, Bedingfield pointed out that the Times\u2019 reporting had promptly been challenged by Bloomberg News, which said the investigation into Burisma had been \u201cdormant\u201d at the time Biden was discussing Shokin\u2019s future with Ukrainian leaders. Bedingfield also noted that Mendel, one of the co-authors of the Times story, joined the Ukrainian government as a spokesperson for the president of Ukraine\u00a0just weeks after the article was published. Biden\u2019s campaign also took issue with an op-ed critical of the Bidens published in the Times on Wednesday by author Peter Schweizer, who was lambasted by Bedingfield as a \u201cdiscredited, right-wing polemicist.\u201d Schweizer \u201chas been one of the top people pushing the claim that Biden abused his office,\u201d Darcy wrote in CNN\u2019s Reliable Sources newsletter,\u00a0adding that Schweizer \u2015 a senior contributor at right-wing site Breitbart \u2015 previously pushed the debunked conspiracy theory about Hillary Clinton benefiting from a \u201cpay-for-play\u201d scheme involving uranium reserves. In response to the Biden campaign\u2019s letter, the Times defended its coverage of Biden and his son as \u201cfair and accurate.\u201d The Times\u00a0\u201cwill continue to cover Joe Biden with the same tough and fair standards we apply to every candidate in the race and we\u2019re happy to sit down with Biden advisers anytime to discuss news coverage,\u201d a spokesman told Darcy, adding that Schweizer\u2019s op-ed had been published in the Opinion section of the newspaper, \u201cwhere their mission is to invite intelligent discussion on a range of opinions and ideas.\u201d Bedingfield\u2019s dressing-down of the Times follows two other letters sent this week by the Biden campaign to Facebook and Twitter. In those letters, Biden\u2019s team criticized the companies for allowing a Trump campaign video ad that pushes the Biden-Ukraine conspiracy to run on their platforms \u2015 and urged them to block the clip. Facebook has refused to remove the ad, citing a \u201cfundamental belief in free expression\u201d and \u201crespect for the democratic process.\u201d Twitter has yet to respond publicly to the request. The dissemination of \u201cobjectively false information to influence public opinion poisons the public discourse and chips away at our democracy,\u201d Biden campaign spokesman TJ Ducklo said in a statement about the ad to CNN. \u201cWhether it originates from the Kremlin or Trump Tower, these lies and conspiracy theories threaten to undermine the integrity of our elections in America,\u201d Ducklo added. As NBC News\u2019 Dylan Byers reported Wednesday, Facebook and Twitter aren\u2019t the only platforms that have continued to air Trump\u2019s Biden-Ukraine ad despite its unfounded content. CNN is the only media or tech company that\u2019s banned the ad from its airwaves, Byers said. NBC News, ABC News and YouTube are among the organizations that have not.",

            "content": " The 2020 presidential field is full of candidates with ambitious plans for higher education. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) wants to erase all student debt and make public universities tuition-free. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Ma.) wants to eliminate tuition at public universities and wipe out most student loan debt. Former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s plan, released Tuesday morning, aims neither to make all public universities free nor eliminate student debt. But his campaign insists his plan is just as big. \u201cWe reject any premise this plan is not equally bold as those plans,\u201d said a senior campaign official on the phone with reporters. \u201cThe Biden plan reflects the vice president\u2019s and Dr. [Jill] Biden\u2019s deep commitment to making sure every child in this country can pursue a bachelor\u2019s degree or community college.\u201d Biden\u2019s plan focuses on improving access to community college and making all college more affordable for needy students. The Biden family has a strong connection to community college: His wife, Jill, who has a doctorate in education, has spent much of her career teaching in one. \u201cThey work so hard and ask for only one thing in return: opportunity,\u201d Jill Biden said on the call. Through legislation, Joe Biden aims to make community college tuition-free for all students for up to two years, with the federal government covering 75% of the cost and states covering the rest. Beyond tuition, qualifying students could use Pell grants and state aid to cover the rest of their expenses, according to the plan. Much of Biden\u2019s vision for higher education builds on what he started with former President Barack Obama, according to campaign officials. The Obama administration proposed tuition-free community college in 2015. However, Biden\u2019s plan also includes a number of measures that would also help students complete their degrees. He proposes a grant that would help community colleges create an emergency fund for students undergoing unexpected financial hardships. The plan also includes an $8 billion investment in community college facilities. Biden\u2019s proposal seeks to make a dent in college debt, albeit one that is specific and targeted to individuals making below a certain amount of money. Biden says he would double the maximum value of Pell grants \u2015 a grant for low-income students that does not need to be repaid. Under a Biden presidency, people making less than $25,000 a year wouldn\u2019t have to make loan repayments or accrue interest, though everyone else would have to pay 5% of their discretionary income. In contrast, Sanders\u2019 and Warren\u2019s student debt plans are far more expansive. Sanders has announced his intention to cancel nearly all student loan debt, regardless of a debtors\u2019 income. Warren would eliminate a portion of debt for every household making below $250,000. Biden\u2019s plan also includes major investments in historically black colleges and universities, tribal colleges and universities, and other minority-serving institutions, including $18 billion in grants and $20 billion for infrastructure. \u201cStudent debt both exacerbates and results from [the] racial wealth gap,\u201d according to the plan.",

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) was the first Democratic candidate to call for Trump\u2019s impeachment, based on conclusions made by former special counsel Robert Mueller in his report on Russian influence in the 2016 election and whether Trump obstructed justice.

The former vice president made the comments to CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper, who was moderating the Los Angeles town hall event, a forum for nine Democratic presidential candidates to discuss LGBTQ issues. After going on a tangent about stereotypes surrounding gay people, Biden concluded with a reflection on how the discourse about homosexuality had changed in recent years, compared with about two decades ago: \u201cRemember, Anderson? Back 15, 20 years ago, when we talked about this in San Francisco, it was all about,\u00a0well, gay bathhouses.\u00a0It was all about round-the-clock sex.\u00a0Come on, man.\u00a0Gay couples are more likely to stay together longer than heterosexual couples,\u201d he said. On a more serious note, Biden also discussed curtailing foreign assistance to countries who discriminate against LGBTQ citizens, the importance of passing the Equality Act in order to reduce hate crimes and protecting transgender people\u2019s right to join the military. At one point, he referenced a time when he \u201ccame out\u201d but rolled with the joke and walked across the stage to put his arm around Cooper, who is gay. \u201cWell, that would be news,\u201d Cooper joked back. \u201cI kind of figured it out a while ago.\u201d People on Twitter were very confused by, well, all of it. Although, there was one resounding thing viewers could agree with that they wanted out of this: A remix of \u201cgay, gay, gay bathhouses.\u201d It was quickly delivered:",

            "content": " Presidential candidate Joe Biden said Sunday that no family member of his would have an office in the White House or act as a diplomat under his potential administration. The Democrat\u2019s comments at a United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) forum in Iowa were in response to an NBC reporter\u2019s question of what kind of ethical guidelines Biden would create if elected president. The reporter referenced the candidate\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, whose business dealings in China and Ukraine have been at the center of President Donald Trump\u2019s attempt to investigate unsubstantiated allegations of corruption\u00a0against the Bidens. \u201cNo one in my family will have an office in the White House, will sit in meetings as if they are a cabinet member, will in fact have any business relationship with anyone that relates to a foreign corporation or a foreign country,\u201d the former vice president told reporters. \u201cPeriod. End of story.\u201d Biden appeared to be drawing a contrast with Trump\u2019s children, some of whom have been involved either as senior advisers in the White House or as\u00a0diplomats with foreign nations. The Democrat\u2019s remarks came just hours after his son Hunter Biden announced his planned resignation\u00a0from the board of a Chinese-backed private equity firm. Hunter Biden\u2019s attorney, George Mesires, released a statement earlier Sunday\u00a0that said the younger Biden intends to resign from the board of directors of BHR Partners by Oct. 31. The statement also said Hunter Biden promises to avoid conflicts of interest if his father is elected president, and will continue to keep the former vice president out of his business affairs. At the forum, Joe Biden continued to stress that he has not discussed his son\u2019s business affairs with him, adding that he was not aware of what was in Mesires\u2019 statement until he read it upon release. \u201cWhat I\u2019m not going to let you all do is let you take the focus off the problem,\u201d Biden told reporters at the UFCW forum. \u201cNo one has asserted my son did a single thing wrong. No one has asserted that I\u2019ve done anything wrong except the lying president. That\u2019s the only thing. That\u2019s the focus.\u201d Hunter Biden had served on the board of Ukrainian gas company Burisma Holdings when Joe Biden was vice president, and stepped down from the position in April. The younger Biden\u2019s attorney has maintained that no law enforcement agency has ever accused his client of wrongdoing during his time on the board. In a July phone call, Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden\u2019s work in the country while his father, now one of Trump\u2019s political rivals, was vice president. Trump\u2019s phone call, and his request that a foreign government interfere in the 2020 U.S. election, is part of what sparked the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry into the president for abusing the power of his office to benefit his reelection campaign. Trump has repeatedly defended his actions and denied any wrongdoing, saying that the call was \u201cperfect.\u201d Biden announced last week that he believes Trump should be impeached. He was one of the last 2020 Democrats to say so.",

The first will be in Phoenix on Wednesday, on what would have been his 82nd birthday. Officials in a number of states and municipalities have ordered flags to be flown at half-staff, including at the U.S. Capitol and other government buildings. Flags at the White House, however, were raised to full-staff less than 48 hours after McCain\u2019s death. The National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C., on Monday\u00a0placed a portrait of McCain on its \u201cIn Memoriam\u201d wall, located on the museum\u2019s first floor. Here\u2019s a calendar of other major events that will honor McCain\u2019s life. McCain\u2019s body will lie in state in the rotunda of the Arizona state Capitol. The public can pay their respects beginning at 2 p.m. local time following a private service at 10 a.m., according to McCain\u2019s office. Arizonans will hold a memorial service for McCain at North Phoenix Baptist Church. Tickets are no longer available but the event will be livestreamed on McCain\u2019s website. McCain\u2019s body will lie in state inside the U.S. Capitol Rotunda. His Senate colleagues and staff will honor him in a ceremony beginning at 11 a.m. Eastern time Friday. Members of the public will be able to enter through the Capitol Visitor Center and\u00a0pay their respects from 2 p.m. to 8 p.m. McCain will become one of about three dozen people in U.S. history to be honored through this tradition, according to the Architect of the Capitol. Lying \u201cin state\u201d refers to government leaders and military members, and lying \u201cin honor\u201d refers to private citizens. Past dignitaries who have been memorialized in this way include former presidents Abraham Lincoln and John F. Kennedy, as well as civil rights icon Rosa Parks. The most recent person to lie in honor was evangelical leader Billy Graham, who died in February. A televised funeral service will begin at 10 a.m. at the Washington National Cathedral. At McCain\u2019s request, former presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush\u00a0are set to deliver eulogies. McCain ran presidential campaigns against both men. President Donald Trump, however, does not plan to attend. McCain reportedly did not want him there, after Trump\u2019s relentless personal attacks on McCain. McCain\u2019s family will hold a private service at his alma mater in Annapolis, Maryland, before laying him to rest at the academy\u2019s cemetery. This post has been updated with additional memorial events for McCain.",

Amy Klobuchar, a Democratic White House contender and friend of the late Arizonan, told a crowd of voters here. Klobuchar, speaking to a crowd of more than 200 at Jasper\u2019s Winery, said she sat next to McCain, one of Trump\u2019s most outspoken Republican critics, and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) during the inaugural address, which became known for its blunt expression of Trump\u2019s authoritarian populism and invocations of \u201cAmerican carnage.\u201d \u201cI sat on that stage between Bernie and John McCain, and John McCain kept reciting to me names of dictators during that speech because he knew more than any of us what we were facing as a nation,\u201d Klobuchar said. \u201cHe understood it. He knew because he knew this man more than any of us did.\u201d McCain and Trump feuded frequently during the president\u2019s first 18 months in office, and the president has continued to attack McCain since the senator\u2019s death last August. McCain refused to endorse Trump during the 2016 campaign, and later attacked his approach to politics as a \u201chalf-baked, spurious nationalism cooked up by people who would rather find scapegoats than solve problems.\u201d Trump, for his part, attacked McCain for his vote to kill an Obamacare repeal bill in the Senate and famously criticized him for being captured while serving as a pilot in Vietnam. \u201cI like people who weren\u2019t captured,\u201d he said in the early stages of his presidential bid. McCain faced criticism from Democrats for not doing more to oppose the policies and appointments of a president he frequently lambasted, but Klobuchar and other Democratic senators frequently praise him as a Republican they were able to work with during increasingly partisan times. Klobuchar regularly mentions her friendship with McCain during her stump speech. CORRECTION: This article previously misidentified McCain as a fighter pilot.

The former Republican presidential nominee was often spoken of as a military hero, a political maverick and as someone with a bit of a temper. But he was far from a humorless politician. McCain had a great sense of humor, in fact.\u00a0Like many politicians running for president, he appeared on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d The difference with McCain, though, was that he really seemed to relish the experience, making plenty of jokes at his own expense. In one clip, seen below, McCain appears on the show\u2019s \u201cWeekend Update\u201d to explain to host Seth Meyers his many outlandish ideas for shoring up votes in the 2008 presidential election. They include strategies like \u201cThe Reverse Maverick,\u201d \u201cThe Double Maverick\u201d and, our favorite, \u201cThe Sad Grandpa,\u201d in which McCain is to appear on television and sadly proclaim, \u201cCome on, Obama\u2019s going to have plenty of chances to run for president \u2015 it\u2019s my turn!\u201d The Arizona senator could also dish it out, but in ways that weren\u2019t mean-spirited. During the 2008 Alfred E. Smith dinner \u2015 a tradition where both presidential candidates tell jokes and roast each other \u2015 McCain dryly (and brilliantly) overhyped then-Sen. Barack Obama\u2019s upcoming turn at the podium after claiming to have seen the transcript of his routine. \u201cYou are all about to witness the funniest performance in the 63-year history of this event,\u201d McCain said. \u201cLet\u2019s not add to the mounting pressure he must be feeling. Just prepare yourself for nonstop hilarity. The funniest 15 minutes of your life or any other.\u201d How do you follow that? On \u201cSNL,\u201d he usually played himself, but in this sketch parodying a Lifetime movie, McCain plays a creepy husband who wants nothing more than to be close to his darling wife, played by Amy Poehler. It\u2019s a long bit but worth watching. McCain leaves behind a celebrated legacy. He was a decorated veteran and a lifelong public servant. And, as his onetime legislative partner, the\u00a0former Sen. Russ Feingold, points out, \u201che was also really fun.\u201d It certainly looks like it.",

Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) had complimentary things to say about\u00a0John McCain,\u00a0but viewed the White House\u2019s indecision surrounding how long to fly the flag at half-staff unsurprising given the late senator\u2019s rocky relationship with President Donald Trump. \u201cWell, you know, frankly, I think that John McCain is partially to blame for that because he is very outspoken,\u201d Inhofe told reporters\u00a0Monday. \u201cHe disagreed with the president in certain areas and wasn\u2019t too courteous about it.\u201d Both men, he said, were \u201cstrong-willed people.\u201d Inhofe did also offer reverential statements about McCain, calling him a \u201cfighter\u201d and a \u201chero.\u201d The White House moved its American flag to half-staff on Saturday evening to honor McCain but had\u00a0returned it to full-staff\u00a0by Monday morning. Protocol calls for the flag to be lowered for a day and a half following the death of a sitting member of Congress, yet it\u2019s common for presidents to issue a proclamation when a high-profile figure dies which directs all public buildings and military bases to partially lower the flag until the day of interment. It took Trump two days following McCain\u2019s death on Saturday to\u00a0issue that proclamation, announcing Monday that the White House flag would yet again be lowered until the interment this coming Sunday.\u00a0He also reportedly refused to release a statement that including the word \u201chero,\u201d according to The Washington Post. Flags at the U.S. Capitol, meanwhile, have been at half-staff since Saturday and will remain that way all week, a spokesman for House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) told HuffPost. Trump and McCain frequently butted heads\u00a0on matters of policy, although Trump\u2019s attacks on McCain were viciously personal. He famously tried to argue that McCain shouldn\u2019t be considered a war hero since he didn\u2019t manage to avoid being captured during the Vietnam War. \u201cI like people who weren\u2019t captured,\u201d he said.",

Former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin told Fox News on Thursday evening that, unlike Reps. Michelle Bachmann (R-Minn) and Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), she still intends to speak at the convention, despite the growing controversy over the obscure for-profit entity running the event. \u201cOh, you betcha I\u2019m going to be there,\u201d Palin told Greta Van Susteren. \u201cI\u2019m going to speak there because there are people traveling from many miles away to hear what that tea party movement is all about and what that message is that should be received by our politicians in Washington. I\u2019m honored to get to be there.\u201d Palin is getting $100,000 to deliver the keynote address at the conference. The 2008 vice presidential candidate insisted that her fee will \u201cgo right back into the cause\u201d in the form of donations \u201cto people and to events, those things that I believe in that will help perpetuate the message, the message being, Government, you have constitutional limits. You better start abiding by them.\u201d Asked by Van Susteren whether she thinks the Republican Party would be best served by merging with the tea party movement, Palin replied with an enthusiastic endorsement of the idea. \u201cThey need to merge,\u201d she said. \u201cDefinitely, they need to merge. I think those who are wanting the divisions and the divisiveness and the controversy \u2014 those are the ones who don\u2019t believe in the message. And they\u2019re the ones, I think, stirring it up. We need to ignore that and we need to forge ahead with a cohesive message. It\u2019s a common sense message. It, again, is, Government, limit yourself so that the private sector, our families, free individuals can grow and thrive and prosper and enjoy America\u2019s freedom!\u201d WATCH Palin on Fox.

The former Alaska governor told Sean Hannity, in a taping of the conservative firebrand\u2019s radio program on Wednesday, that she was \u201cnot gonna back off\u201d the criticism that the health care bill would pursue cost saving measures by rationing end of life care. \u201cIf the health care bill goes the way Obama wants it, we\u2019re gonna have something very much like foreign countries\u2019 systems of health care like the British, and it\u2019s the American people \u2014 if we have our health care paid for by the bureaucracy, by government \u2014 depending on our health condition, depending on our age \u2014 we\u2019re gonna be subject to bureaucrats deciding, panels and commissions deciding \u2014 just like they do overseas \u2014 who will be worthy of receiving the health care that government is going to provide.\u201d \u201cSo that is the death panel that I referred to, and I won\u2019t back off on criticizing that aspect of the health care bill.\u201d COMMENTS COME ABOUT SEVEN MINUTES IN: The remarks come roughly two weeks after Palin took to her Facebook page to re-assert the validity of the much-criticized (and thoroughly debunked) death panel. That entry from the former vice presidential candidate, in turn, was in response to PolitiFact.com post that dubbed the argument the \u201clie of the year.\u201d Palin scoffed at that critique. But there was one hitch to her re-assertion. She changed the definition about what actually constituted the death panel. In her first go-around, the former governor referenced end-of-life counseling in the health care legislation. In the post-Politifact Facebook entry she insisted that the death panel was coming in the form of a Medicare Advisory Board \u2014 a panel that a large number of well-respected economist have deemed important to rein in costs in Medicare (not, say, cut the plug on granny).

Really. The 2008 vice presidential candidate put up a Facebook post on Monday evening arguing that Emanuel\u2019s offending slur (in which he said that liberal groups thinking of running health care-related ads against Democratic lawmakers were \u201cF\u2014-ing retarded\u201d) was no less the equivalent of using the \u201cN-word.\u201d I would ask the president to show decency in this process by eliminating one member of that inner circle, Mr. Rahm Emanuel, and not allow Rahm\u2019s continued indecent tactics to cloud efforts. Yes, Rahm is known for his caustic, crude references about those with whom he disagrees, but his recent tirade against participants in a strategy session was such a strong slap in many American faces that our president is doing himself a disservice by seeming to condone Rahm\u2019s recent sick and offensive tactic. The Obama Administration\u2019s Chief of Staff scolded participants, calling them, \u201cF\u2014-ing retarded,\u201d according to several participants, as reported in the Wall Street Journal. Just as we\u2019d be appalled if any public figure of Rahm\u2019s stature ever used the \u201cN-word\u201d or other such inappropriate language, Rahm\u2019s slur on all God\u2019s children with cognitive and developmental disabilities - and the people who love them - is unacceptable, and it\u2019s heartbreaking. The Emanuel remark was reported recently by The Wall Street Journal but dates back to  the heat of the health care wars in August. And it certainly wasn\u2019t the first time the chief of staff (known for an acid tongue) has leveled an odious broadside at one group or another from his perch in the West Wing. Palin presumably seized on this one because of her own experience with the issue \u2014 her youngest child, of course, suffers from Down syndrome. But it\u2019s hard to ignore the fact that making hay out of \u201ccontroversies\u201d like these is her political trademark, regardless of whether there is a personal tie to the matter.",

Is the Newsweek cover sexist? Yes. But let\u2019s put the photo back into context for a minute: Sarah Palin\u2019s entire existence is sexist. Let\u2019s try to imagine, for a moment, the thought process that went into creating this Newsweek cover image : \u201cWe need to convey that Palin sucks really bad! Let\u2019s take some photo of Palin lookin\u2019 sexy, slap it on the cover of Newsweek, and then use her sexuality in attempt to draw attention to all the terrible things this woman has brought upon us.\u201d Hey! That sounds kind of like what John McCain did when he chose Palin as his VP: Found an attractive lady, slapped her on to his campaign, and used her image as a sexy lady in order to distract people from her scant qualifications, her total lack of concern for women\u2019s issues, and her complete suckiness as a candidate. Real talk. As Hess points out, Palin has been subjected to a noticeable share of deplorable treatment. And I think it\u2019s absurd to suggest that Newsweek selected this photo from Runner\u2019s World magazine because they thought it would cast the subject of their cover story in a neutral light or elucidate the magazine\u2019s underlying point. I think that Newsweek made the choice they did to ensure that if they couldn\u2019t manage a discrediting of Palin on the merits, they could plant their discrediting through some cheap subtextual shortcut. But Hess is correct when she points out that \u201cthe game works both ways.\u201d  You remember that whole day of our lives that was given over to that riveting discussion over whether the phrase \u201clipstick on a pig,\u201d was a sexist slag at Sarah Palin?  Because at one point, Palin had used the word \u201clipstick\u201d in a joke?  That bought Palin a whole day of media figures rising to her defense over something that was plainly nonsensical.  Hess puts it like this: \u201cI am sick and tired of only having to care about it when that sexism means something bad for Sarah Palin.\u201d  But you know what?

She donated $64,600 to candidates and party committees. That relatively high burn rate is due to an expansion of the organization\u2019s staff, according to those familiar with its operations. (Remember that with Palin out of office \u2014 she resigned the governorship in July 2009 \u2014 her PAC is her only political and policy vehicle.) Beyond new staff and donations, what else is Sarah PAC spending money on? Books \u2014 her own book \u2014 according to ABC News: The former Alaska governor and 2008 Republican vice presidential candidate had her political organization spend more than $63,000 on what her reports describe as \u201cbooks for fundraising donor fulfillment.\u201d The payments went to Harper Collins, her publisher, and in some instances to HSP Direct, a Virginia-based direct mail fundraising firm that serves a number of well-known conservative politicians and pundits. Sarah PAC spent another $8,000 on colorful bookmarks designed by a Nashville-based event branding firm. And her committee paid her publisher $20,000 for what appears to have been the cost of sending her personal photographer and another aide along on her book tour. Hotline offers a more detailed breakdown of the former governor\u2019s expenditures. How many copies of \u201cGoing Rogue\u201d would $63,000 buy? It depends. Without knowing how much sales tax was paid on the books or if the former governor bought them at a bulk rate, Palin\u2019s group could have bought anywhere from 2,173 (at suggested full retail price of $28.99) to 4,666 copies (at a steeply discounted Amazon rate of $13.50).",

            "content": " MANCHESTER, N.H. \u2014 When most people think back on Sarah Palin\u2019s F5 tornado of a 2008 vice-presidential run, one of a few lasting images might jump immediately to mind. If you\u2019re a fan of hers, maybe it\u2019s the pitch-perfect line about hockey moms and pit bulls that she ad-libbed at her barnburner of a nomination speech at the Republican convention in St. Paul, Minnesota. If you\u2019re not, perhaps it\u2019s the Alaska moose-in-headlights moment when she failed to provide Katie Couric with the name of a single newspaper or magazine that she read to stay informed. For me, it\u2019s something different. During the 2008 general election, I was one of less than a dozen journalists who traveled around the country with Palin from the beginning of her campaign to the end of it as an off-air reporter for CBS News. In this role, I had an up-close view of the woman who most Americans only saw on their TV screens, or \u2014 if they were a supporter \u2014 from whatever vantage point they managed to secure among the cheering crowds that regularly numbered in the tens of thousands around the country. Palin and I flew on the same chartered campaign plane, laughed in unison as we watched Tina Fey role out her uncanny impression on \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d and interacted fairly regularly as fellow travelers on a shared, strange trip \u2014 particularly after she \u201cwent rogue\u201d and started talking to her assigned press corps more frequently. No matter the campaign\u2019s intended message of the day \u2014 or what McCain\u2019s strategists wanted her to say \u2014 there were two topics that Palin never failed to bring up on her own wherever she went: People with disabilities and the heroism of her running mate, John McCain. Most of the country saw Palin as a two-dimensional caricature, but I never once questioned her sincerity when it came to these particular causes.\u00a0After all, I was there when she exchanged a series of heartfelt hugs with a woman afflicted with Down syndrome in Pennsylvania and watched as she lingered to commiserate with Gold Star moms in Indianapolis. And as my co-author Shushannah Walshe and I reported in our 2009 book, Sarah From Alaska, on election night at McCain headquarters in Arizona, Palin sought to give her own heartfelt concession speech that relied heavily on the two subject matters that she was most passionate about. The speech, which McCain campaign aides ultimately barred her from delivering, included a particularly touching recollection of Palin\u2019s interaction with a boy with Down syndrome named Charlie, whom she had met at a rally in Florida. \u201cSo tonight, a special shout-out to you, Chuck\u2026 darlin\u2019,\u201d Palin intended to say in her address in defeat that night. \u201cAnd let me repeat what I told you, because it applies to you and to all children and adults with special needs across America: You are beautiful, and I am so proud to know that my boy Trig will grow up to be just like you \u2026 it\u2019s time America shows you her good heart.\u201d On her second pet topic \u2014 McCain\u2019s exceptional bravery \u2014 Palin had intended to deliver another particularly eloquent salute: Above all, I am grateful to the man who took a chance on me. From that moment to this, I have had the rare enough privilege in politics of praising a candidate whose story, character, and personal heroism required no embellishment. I said things about him \u2014 about how valiantly he has served and what he has overcome \u2014 things he could not say about himself, because he is that kind of man. It would be a happier night if elections were a test of valor and merit alone, but that is not for us to question now. Enough to say it has been the honor of a lifetime to fight at the side of John S. McCain. Perhaps it was for the best that McCain\u2019s aides did not allow her to give the speech that night. If they had, Palin may have felt a tinge of the shame that appeared to be entirely lacking during the full-throated endorsement she gave Donald Trump on Tuesday night. Trump, you\u2019ll recall, is the Republican presidential front-runner, who in July unapologetically declared that McCain \u2014 a former Vietnam War prisoner of war who spent five-and-a-half-years in captivity, and endured torture at the Hanoi Hilton \u2014 was \u201cnot a war hero\u201d before adding a memorable addendum, as only he could. \u201cI like people that weren\u2019t captured, OK?\u201d said Trump, who has pointed to a \u201cfoot thing\u201d as one reason why he received a series of deferments during the Vietnam era. And, yes. Trump is also the same guy who in November stood on a stage and performed a crude imitation of a New York Times reporter who suffers from a physical disability. Now, imagine for a moment that we\u2019re back in 2008 during those tumultuous autumn weeks when the markets were melting down and Palin was seeking to lift the GOP ticket to an unlikely comeback through the sheer force of her personality. What if then it had been a Democrat who\u2019d questioned McCain\u2019s heroism or mocked a person with a disability in front of a cheering crowd? How might Sarah Palin have responded to that? I have a pretty good guess. Let\u2019s just say that the echoes of righteous indignation would\u2019ve been audible from here to Wasilla. Until her shameless endorsement of America\u2019s most famous bully, Palin largely had been loyal to McCain \u2014 the man who plucked her from relative obscurity in Alaska and made her a household name. At the height of the Tea Party wave, for instance, Palin endorsed and campaigned for McCain against his conservative challenger during a tough 2010 Republican primary fight in Arizona. And McCain, in turn, has offered nothing but public praise for his former running mate in the ensuing years. Still, Palin\u2019s endorsement of her fellow reality TV star shouldn\u2019t come as a complete surprise. Politically, Palin and Trump have much in common in their anti-establishment instincts, ideological fluidity and eagerness to use vitriol as their most potent weapon against adversaries. And in several ways, Trump\u2019s campaign represents the realization of the grievance-driven populism that Palin first brought to national prominence eight years ago. Her endorsement wasn\u2019t a surprise to me. Palin had made her intentions pretty clear on this front back in July when she argued with a straight face that, hey, Donald\u2019s a hero, too \u2014 just like McCain! Much like Trump, Palin\u2019s every public move these days appears intended to boost her brand \u2014 the brand that has made her untold millions of dollars since she quit her day job in mid term back in 2009, but has become less potent by the year since then. And for a fading celebrity-politician in desperate need of a new jolt of attention and influence, the ability to give Trump a much-needed boost among conservatives in Iowa was a temptation too powerful to turn down \u2014 it made sense in the context of Palin\u2019s need to maintain whatever is left of the political image she so carefully protects. It probably didn\u2019t make a whole lot of sense to McCain though \u2014 or to Charlie.",

            "content": "Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin\u2019s political action committee, SarahPAC, is kicking off what is likely to be a busy year with $1.3 million in the bank, Politico\u2019s look at the group\u2019s Federal Election Commission filings finds. The FEC records show that Palin raised $279,000 over a five-week period at the end of the year, donations that came primarily in sums of $200 or less. The PAC also spent nearly $230,000 during the filing period and a total of nearly $2.6 million throughout 2010, according to the report. Perhaps the most interesting tidbit, however, is the apparent lack of any notable fundraising or staffing push from the political arm of a candidate who has been among the most talked-about potential 2012 GOP presidential contenders. From Politico\u2019s report: The filing shows no indication that Palin has started to ramp up for a potential presidential run, as no new staff shows up on SarahPAC\u2019s expenses \u2014 which remain very low compared to a campaign of even moderate size. Her PAC spent nearly $230,000 for the period between the end of the campaign and end of the calendar year, and over $2.6 million in 2010. Despite those details, a recent report from RealClearPolitics suggested that Palin\u2019s operatives are, in fact, actively developing a ground game in the key primary state of Iowa, though perhaps not in a manner that would be clear from the FEC filing. From the RealClearPolitics report: Palin\u2019s initial Iowa push appears to differ most clearly from that of other candidates in that no SarahPAC staffer has been assigned to work the state on the ground, and her aides are not yet making hard pushes to lock up experienced operatives. According to RCP, Palin\u2019s pre-campaign architecture has instead been heavily constructed through third-party grassroots activists and private discussions with local Tea Party leaders.",

Seventy-four percent of Democrats have an unfavorable opinion of her, as do 55 percent of Independents and 15 percent of Republicans.

According to the survey the approval rating of Palin\u2019s replacement, Republican Gov. Sean Parnell, stands at 58 percent, while only 19 percent disapprove. These high marks also remain consistent across party lines, with 51 percent of Democrats and 55 percent of Independents approving. The poll also showed that only 4 percent of Alaska Republicans approve of President Obama\u2019s performance, and only 14 percent of Republicans approve of the job Democratic Sen.

            "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama gave the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation\u2019s highest civilian honor, to 21 artists, sports figures, scientists and philanthropists on Tuesday in a bravura performance that had the East Wing, stuffed to capacity, laughing and whooping with appreciation. \u201cEveryone on this stage has touched me in a powerful personal way,\u201d Mr. Obama said at the ceremony\u2019s end. \u201cThese are folks who have helped make me who I am and think about my presidency.\u201d Mr. Obama has given more Presidential Medals of Freedom than any previous president, and the surprising announcement last week that he would induct one last class \u2014 he held a similar ceremony two months ago \u2014 reflected his obvious joy in lauding his personal heroes, and the awareness that many of them would probably never receive such an honor from his successor. Many of the awardees have praised Democrats or been sharply critical of President-elect Donald J. Trump. Among the honorees were Robert Redford, Bill and Melinda Gates, Tom Hanks and Diana Ross. When he put the medal around the neck of Michael Jordan, Mr. Obama, an avid basketball fan, beamed like a 10-year-old. \u201cIt\u2019s useful, when you think about this incredible collection of people, to realize this is what makes us the greatest nation on earth,\u201d he said in a not-so-subtle dig at Mr. Trump\u2019s promise to \u201cmake America great again.\u201d \u201cNot because of our differences, but because in our differences we find something in common to share. And what a glorious gift that is.\u201d The president\u2019s opening speech was poignant, revealing and at times hilarious. In a tribute to Ellen DeGeneres, for instance, he spoke with emotion about the courage Ms. DeGeneres had needed to tell a national audience that she is gay. \u201cBut it\u2019s like Ellen says, \u2018We all want a tortilla chip to support the weight of guacamole,\u2019\u201d Mr. Obama said, seemingly out of nowhere, as Ms. DeGeneres nodded behind him and the audience laughed. \u201cWhich really makes no sense to me. But I wanted to break the mood, because I was getting choked up.\u201d He took a dig at Mr. Jordan, the basketball star, by calling him \u201cthe guy from \u2018Space Jam,\u2019\u201d a 1996 film with Bugs Bunny. A tall man, Mr. Obama had such trouble reaching up to put the award around the towering Kareem Abdul-Jabbar\u2019s neck that the basketball great leaned back to help. Pardons, commutations, Medals of Honor and other presidential gifts usually have a formalized process, with layers of staff review before the final list of grantees is chosen. But the Presidential Medal of Freedom has often been bestowed via a quirky and haphazard review that reflects the personality of the president. And that has been particularly true in this administration. The recipients paraded up to the podium area Tuesday after they were announced by a White House aide who managed to mispronounce the names of Mr. Redford, Bruce Springsteen and Cicely Tyson. When he spoke, Mr. Obama began his list of awardees with the world\u2019s richest couple, Bill and Melinda Gates. \u201cFirst, we came close to missing out on Bill and Melinda Gates\u2019s incredible partnership,\u201d he said, deadpan. \u201cBecause apparently Bill\u2019s opening line was, \u2018Do you want to go out two weeks from this coming Saturday?\u2019 I mean, he\u2019s good with computers, you know?\u201d he said to laughter. \u201cFortunately, Melinda believes in second chances, and the world is better for it.\u201d Mr. Gates has donated nearly $40 billion to charity and, with a similar donation from Warren Buffett, now runs by far the world\u2019s largest charitable endeavor, which spends hundreds of millions of dollars in India and Africa to save children\u2019s lives. The couple have also invested in and shared some of the Obama administration\u2019s most important priorities, including its education and climate initiatives. When he turned to the actor Robert De Niro, Mr. Obama said his \u201ccharacters are iconic.\u201d \u201cA Sicilian father turned New York mobster. A mobster who runs a casino. A mobster who needs therapy. A father-in-law who\u2019s scarier than a mobster. Al Capone, a mobster,\u201d he said to growing laughter as Mr. De Niro gave his characteristic tough-guy frown behind him. Mr. Obama\u2019s tribute to Vin Scully, the legendary play-by-play baseball broadcaster, noted that Mr. Scully\u2019s career started at the same time as Jackie Robinson\u2019s. \u201cIn fact, I thought about him doing all these citations, which would have been very cool,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cBut I thought we shouldn\u2019t make him sing for his supper like that.\u201d \u201cUp next \u2026,\u201d Mr. Obama said, mimicking Mr. Scully. In the case of Mr. Jordan, Mr. Obama overcame some testy exchanges. In 2014, Mr. Jordan criticized the president\u2019s golf game and called him a \u201chack\u201d on the green. Mr. Obama responded that Mr. Jordan, a golfer himself, should focus his attention on the perennially struggling Charlotte Hornets, which he co-owns. Then there was the incident involving a basketball poster that Mr. Jordan signed \u201cTo Barrack,\u201d misspelling the president\u2019s name. But Mr. Obama was in Chicago when Mr. Jordan was making magic on a basketball court there, and the president has never forgotten it. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason you call somebody \u2018the Michael Jordan of,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThe Michael Jordan of neurosurgery, or the Michael Jordan of rabbis, or the Michael Jordan of outrigger canoeing. They know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d Mr. Springsteen has been a frequent presence in the Obama White House, hosting fund-raisers and even traveling on Air Force One during Mr. Obama\u2019s re-election campaign in 2012, wowing star-struck staff members. Lorne Michaels, the creator and longtime producer of \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d was also a recipient, an honor he would be unlikely to get in a Trump administration. On Sunday, Mr. Trump said on Twitter that he had watched \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d the evening before and wrote: \u201cIt is a totally one-sided, biased show \u2014 nothing funny at all. Equal time for us?\u201d Mr. Hanks and his wife are large donors to Mr. Obama and other Democrats, and he took part in a dinner discussion in February about the future of Mr. Obama\u2019s foundation and library. And Mr. Abdul-Jabbar spoke at the Democratic National Convention, when he slammed Mr. Trump for his proposals to bar Muslim immigrants and introduced himself as Michael Jordan, \u201cbecause I know that Donald Trump couldn\u2019t tell the difference.\u201d",

            "content": " Senator Bernie Sanders has produced the biggest fund-raising quarter of the Democratic primary, as his campaign announced on Tuesday that he had taken in $25.3 million over the last three months. Now the big questions looming over the donor race are whether Senator Elizabeth Warren will surpass him, and whether former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. will trail far behind. Mr. Sanders\u2019s third quarter haul is the latest demonstration of the rising power of small donors to reshape presidential politics. His campaign moved swiftly on Tuesday to assert his financial might, reserving his first television ads of the campaign \u2014 a two-week, $1.3 million buy in Iowa. Yet President Trump displayed fund-raising might that far surpassed any of the Democrats. Republican Party officials said that his re-election campaign and the Republican National Committee had raised $125 million over the last three months, a presidential fund-raising record. Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren have yet to share their much-anticipated totals. But Ms. Warren\u2019s figure is prompting much speculation; she is widely expected to improve upon the $19 million that she raised last quarter as she has surged in the polls to become Mr. Biden\u2019s leading rival. The expectations game is perhaps most fraught for Mr. Biden, whose efforts to fashion himself as the clear front-runner mean that any slippage from the top of the ranks represents a risk. Both Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders have boycotted the big-money circuit, raising the possibility of a watershed moment: The two top fund-raisers in the Democratic Party might end up being candidates who have turned their backs on the established class of political bundlers and financiers who have held sway for decades. The third quarter is known as perhaps the toughest to raise money in, as big donors are often out of town vacationing in July and August while small contributors spend less time online in the summer. But the money totals are critical not only to set budgets, hire staff and run ads but also because they mark the last time in 2019 that campaigns must open their books, hardening public perception of viability \u2014 or lack of it \u2014 during a crucial three-month period. The quarter ended on Monday and campaigns have until Oct. 15 to share their financial figures. Those without enough money can be winnowed quickly from the field; a half-dozen Democratic candidates have already called it quits this year. \u201cIt dictates the narrative in the lead-up to the elections,\u201d said Rufus Gifford, who served as finance director for President Barack Obama\u2019s re-election campaign and has donated to multiple 2020 candidates. \u201cThe big game that\u2019s going on inside the campaigns is how to manage expectations.\u201d The string of fund-raising announcements began early Tuesday morning with Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., who announced that he had raised $19.1 million in the third quarter. It was a dip from the field-leading $24.9 million he posted in the previous quarter, but more than enough to fully fund his once-upstart campaign into this fall and winter. Mr. Buttigieg has developed a grass-roots following, pairing his 580,000 donors with an aggressive calendar of dozens of traditional fund-raising events. Senator Kamala Harris announced an $11.6 million haul \u2014 nearly matching her totals in the first two quarters. She was the only campaign to announce her cash on hand: nearly $10 million, down from $13.3 million at the end of June, meaning she spent more than she raised in the last three months. Mr. Biden raised $22 million in the last quarter, second to Mr. Buttigieg. But there are signs his fund-raising operation has slowed, particularly online, where Mr. Biden has slashed his advertising budget. While Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders did not have to fill their calendars with fund-raisers, Mr. Biden raced across the country in the last three months, from Florida to California, Aspen to the Hamptons, holding more than 40 donor events. His wife, Dr. Jill Biden, headlined another dozen. This weekend, top Biden donors and bundlers have been invited to a retreat in Philadelphia to discuss the campaign\u2019s next phase. Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign has said he scored his best week of fund-raising since the second week of the campaign as Democrats initiated an impeachment inquiry of Mr. Trump over a whistle-blower complaint claiming that Mr. Trump prodded the president of Ukraine to investigate the business dealings there of Mr. Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden. Still, some Biden supporters are nervous about how the impeachment process, and any added scrutiny of Hunter Biden\u2019s business affairs, will play out. Some have even discussed creating a super PAC, which the campaign quickly disavowed. Others see in Ms. Warren\u2019s rise as a top rival, with Mr. Sanders in third, an opportunity for Mr. Biden to truly consolidate a donor class that has remained fractured. Mr. Biden\u2019s ability to attract small donors will be closely scrutinized. In the last 90 days, his campaign ranked 10th among the Democratic presidential candidates for advertising dollars on Facebook, where campaigns often prospect for new contributors. He spent less than one-quarter of what Mr. Buttigieg had spent on the platform in that time, and well less than half of what Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders had spent, according to Facebook data. Mr. Biden told donors at a sushi restaurant in Los Angeles last week that he had nearly 670,000 donations overall with an average donation of $46, which would translate to only about $10.8 million this quarter. A Biden campaign official said the former vice president had not presented the \u201cfull picture\u201d but declined to elaborate. A Biden campaign official said Tuesday that the former vice president had \u201cunequivocally\u2019\u2019 raised enough money to be competitive in the primary race, and that details would be released soon. [Sign up for our politics newsletter and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race.] Steve Westly, a bundler for Mr. Biden in California, said that skeptics and critics place too much importance on any one measurement of Mr. Biden\u2019s candidacy. \u201cEvery time someone is a front-runner, they say, \u2018Oh my gosh, they\u2019re not ahead in every straw poll, ahead in every state and every fund-raising report,\u2019\u201d Mr. Westly said. \u201cThe reality is you want to be in first place, which is where Joe Biden is.\u201d Harold Schaitberger, a close Biden ally and president of the International Association of Fire Fighters, which has endorsed Mr. Biden, compared the race to a schoolyard game of \u201cking of the hill.\u201d \u201cIf you\u2019re the king and you\u2019re on the hill, everybody else \u2014 in this case certainly within the Democratic candidates and the Republican Party \u2014 are doing everything they can to take you off the hill,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the point of it.\u201d He said he had \u201cseen no indication of any concern\u201d about resources. For Mr. Sanders, his $25.3 million quarter \u2014 which included his second biggest day for fund-raising of the campaign, on Monday \u2014 was a welcome reprieve from weeks of questions about his pathway as he has stagnated in the polls and has been passed on the left by Ms. Warren. (In one Iowa poll, more of those who caucused with Mr. Sanders in 2016 said they planned to support Ms. Warren in 2020 than him.) \u201cMedia elites and professional pundits have tried repeatedly to dismiss this campaign,\u201d said Faiz Shakir, Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign manager, \u201cand yet working-class Americans keep saying loudly and clearly that they want a political revolution.\u201d For Mr. Buttigieg, the third quarter was a period of rapid expansion: He went from zero field offices in the early states to 42, and his staff jumped to 400 people. Mr. Buttigieg, who began the year as a little-known mayor, has raised more than $51 million for the year, a remarkable sum for a newcomer to the national scene. But he has struggled to translate that cash into support beyond single digits in the polls. While Ms. Harris\u2019s haul was similar to her previous quarters, she entered October on a far different trajectory. She began the quarter riding high from her June debate performance \u2014 raising $4 million in the last four days of that month \u2014 but had faded by late September, promising to refocus on Iowa amid a staff shake-up.  One other campaign announced its numbers Tuesday: Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey raised more than $6 million, his best quarter yet. Ten days ago, in a gambit to draw attention and donations, Mr. Booker\u2019s campaign said he would quit the race if he did not collect at least $1.7 million; he raised more than $2.1 million. The quarterly fund-raising report will be the first for Beto O\u2019Rourke, the former Texas representative, since the shooting in his hometown of El Paso that appeared to give his candidacy fresh purpose. Andrew Yang, the New York executive running a web-savvy campaign centered on the idea of giving away $1,000 to every American every month, is expected to post by far his best haul of the campaign.",

            "author": "Matt Stevens",
            "content": " Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont proposed a new corporate tax on Monday that would penalize some of the country\u2019s largest companies if they did not narrow the gap between what they pay their chief executives and what they pay their workers. The proposal is the latest measure from Mr. Sanders aimed at reducing income inequality \u2014 a pillar of his campaign for the Democratic nomination for president. It is also the latest example of the commitment by Mr. Sanders and his leading progressive rival, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, to use America\u2019s tax system to address the wide gulf between ordinary Americans and the rich. \u201cThe American people are sick and tired of corporate C.E.O.s who now make 300 times more than their average employees, while they give themselves huge bonuses and cut back on the health care and pension benefits of their employees,\u201d Mr. Sanders said in a statement. \u201cThey want corporations to invest in their workers, not just dividends, stock buybacks and outrageous compensation packages to their executives.\u201d Mr. Sanders\u2019s proposal would impose tax rate increases on companies whose chief executives make at least 50 times what their typical workers earn. The tax would apply to all private and publicly held corporations with annual revenue of more than $100 million, the Sanders campaign said. The tax penalties would begin at half a percentage point for companies that compensate their highest-paid employees between 50 and 100 times as much as their typical workers, then escalate as the pay gap increases. The biggest penalty \u2014 5 percentage points \u2014 would apply to companies that pay their top executives more than 500 times what they pay a typical worker. Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign said that if current pay patterns continued, the plan would raise about $150 billion over the next decade; the revenue would be used to pay for a plan he released earlier this month to eliminate an estimated $81 billion in existing medical debt. He followed that three days later by proposing an annual tax on the fortunes of the richest Americans, an idea that Ms. Warren has made a centerpiece of her presidential bid. The tax plans the two candidates have proposed would need to be passed by Congress to become law, an unlikely scenario if Republicans retain control of the Senate. Together, Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders have used the 2020 Democratic primary to offer up a substantial rethinking of the federal government\u2019s approach to taxation that would shift more of the burden of paying for government toward the wealthy. \u201cAt a time of massive income and wealth inequality, the American people are demanding that large, profitable corporations pay their fair share of taxes,\u201d Mr. Sanders said in his statement on his corporate tax proposal. \u201cIt is time to send a message to corporate America: If you do not end your greed and corruption, we will end it for you.\u201d Ms. Warren also wants to change how the country\u2019s most profitable corporations are taxed in order to ensure that they are paying their \u201cfair share.\u201d In April, she proposed a new tax on corporations that report more than $100 million in profits. Ms. Warren has another proposal about big corporations, the Accountable Capitalism Act, that addresses executive compensation. The proposal would restrict when top executives can sell company shares, and it would require that workers elect at least 40 percent of a company\u2019s board of directors.",

            "author": "Lawrence K. Altman, M.D.",
            "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 \u201cNone of us know when a medical emergency will affect us,\u201d Senator Bernie Sanders wrote in a tweet from Desert Springs Hospital Medical Center on Wednesday, hours after the 78-year-old Democratic candidate for president experienced one. Mr. Sanders\u2019s emergency \u2014 the sudden onset of chest pain known as angina \u2014 is one that thousands of other Americans experience each year. Mr. Sanders\u2019s discomfort occurred at a campaign event on Tuesday night. Because it signaled acute heart trouble, the senator went to the hospital where doctors implanted two stents in one of the coronary arteries that nourish the heart. Doctors often release patients who undergo such procedures in a day or two. Mr. Sanders remained in the hospital until Friday evening, when \u2014 after three days of revealing few details about his condition \u2014 his campaign confirmed that Mr. Sanders had suffered a heart attack. Until then, Mr. Sanders had not disclosed whether blood and electrocardiogram tests showed he had a heart attack. The senator and his campaign have not allowed reporters to interview his doctors, though advisers have said that Mr. Sanders would be able to appear in the next Democratic debate on Oct. 15. With respect to release of health information, President Trump has not had a medical emergency while running for or serving in office, but he disclosed few specific laboratory test results initially in his 2016 campaign. He issued a four-paragraph letter from his personal physician stating that Mr. Trump would be \u201cthe healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.\u201d Closer to the 2016 election date, Mr. Trump\u2019s doctor offered a more conventional letter that still omitted a number of details that would be part of a customary summary of a patient\u2019s health. In 2018, the doctor, Harold N. Bornstein, said that Trump aides had raided his office a year earlier and taken the president\u2019s medical files after The Times reported that the president had taken a drug for hair growth. And this year, the White House physician pronounced Mr. Trump in \u201cvery good health\u201d although the president had gained weight and is now officially obese. The health questions hang over Mr. Sanders in part because he would become the nation\u2019s oldest president by far if elected. Also, given that implanting two stents in one coronary artery is a very common procedure in American hospitals, it was puzzling that for several days he did not release more details. Mr. Sanders is a private person, no doubt, but most modern-day presidents and serious candidates for the presidency have put forward details to inform the electorate after emergency health issues. Normally, \u201crecovery from stent placement is very quick,\u201d and patients usually go home a day or two after the procedure, said Dr. Jonathan S. Reiner, a cardiologist at George Washington University Hospital in Washington, D.C. who treated former Vice President Dick Cheney for serious heart disease for many years before, during and after his two terms of office. Dr. Reiner is not involved in Mr. Sanders\u2019s care. Older patients and those who experience complications like heart rhythm abnormalities, heart attacks or heart failure may remain in the hospital longer. A patient\u2019s condition usually determines the length of stay. In the 2016 presidential campaign, Mr. Sanders\u2019s doctor said that the senator was \u201cin overall very good health.\u201d His ailments included gout; a mild elevation of cholesterol; an inflammation of out-pouches in the bowel known as diverticulitis; and hormone replacement therapy for an underactive thyroid gland. He had no reported history of heart disease. Tuesday\u2019s episode of angina appears to be his first such incident. In cases like Mr. Sanders\u2019s, doctors perform a standard procedure known as cardiac catheterization. In it, they thread thin tubes into chambers of the heart and inject a radio-opaque dye to produce X-rays outlining the coronary arteries. For Mr. Sanders, the procedure revealed blockage in one artery; he has not said which artery. Doctors would then remove the blockage, which is usually caused by deposits of fatty substances, by inflating a tiny balloon in a tube to squash them. Implanting the stents aims at preventing development of scar tissue and recurrence of the blockage. All presidential hopefuls strive to portray themselves in good health. When a medical event occurs, candidates and their aides, who usually have had little if any medical knowledge, often scurry to play it down to prevent damage to the leader\u2019s image. Mr. Sanders\u2019s event is likely to renew pressure on his rivals to release their health information in a timely fashion. Although some have made pledges, they have not done so. In recent years, most candidates have released their personal health information in statements from their doctors or through interviews. The practice grew out of retrospective analyses of the health of presidents that document how some presidents hid or lied about their health problems, often aided by their doctors. Occasionally, White House doctors have misdiagnosed a president\u2019s heart and vascular problems. Experts believe that President Warren Harding died of a heart attack that his doctor did not detect. Toward the end of President Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s third term and until his death in his fourth term, his White House doctor withheld the fact that he had serious heart failure. President Dwight D. Eisenhower suffered a heart attack near the end of his first term. Examination of his older medical records has provided strong clues that he had a heart attack before he ran for president. In 1999, former Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey damaged his presidential campaign by not disclosing that he had a number of episodes of atrial fibrillation (a heart rhythm abnormality) before he experienced one while campaigning and had to rush to a hospital in the Bay Area with reporters trailing him. Among the current candidates, Joseph R. Biden Jr. underwent emergency surgery in 1988 for a near-fatal ruptured berry aneurysm of an artery in his brain. He also underwent surgery to remove a second berry aneurysm. New cerebral aneurysms can develop years later in a tiny percentage of individuals who have survived one. In 2008, Mr. Biden\u2019s doctor said that he had recovered fully, and that he did not need further tests to detect a new berry aneurysm because he had done well for 20 years. Modern medicine has enabled many individuals with heart disease and other chronic ailments to successfully run for office and fulfill their duties. Nevertheless, Mr. Sanders\u2019s stent episode is likely to renew a measure of voter interest in the health of its 2020 presidential candidates. Two other leading Democratic hopefuls are in their 70s and President Trump is 73. All of them, as well as Mr. Sanders, may well be medically fit to serve, but Americans have never faced the prospects or consequences of so many top candidates who were past the official retirement age.",

            "content": " BURLINGTON, Vt. \u2014 In July 1987, Bernie Sanders, then the mayor of Burlington, Vt., arrived in Ottawa convinced he was about to see the future of health care. Years earlier, as his mother\u2019s health declined and his family struggled to pay for medical treatment, he was spending more time attending to her than in classes at Brooklyn College, suffering through what his brother called \u201ca wrecked year\u2019\u2019 leading to her death. Over time, he had come to believe that the American health care system was flawed and inherently unfair. In Canada, he wanted to observe firsthand the government-backed, universal model that he strongly suspected was better. Amid tours of community centers and meetings with health care providers, Mr. Sanders more than liked what he saw. \u201cHe was thrilled,\u201d recalled Beth Mintz, a professor of sociology at the University of Vermont and a member of a task force that accompanied Mr. Sanders. \u201cIt gave him much more confidence in the possibility of the single-payer system as a solution.\u201d Decades before \u201cMedicare for all\u201d would propel his presidential campaigns, Mr. Sanders\u2019s expedition to Ottawa helped forge his determination to transform the American health care system. His views burst onto the national political scene during his 2016 presidential run, when he championed a single-payer program alongside many other liberal policy ideas. Now, as he seeks the Democratic presidential nomination for a second time, he has made \u201cMedicare for all\u201d the most important issue of his campaign and set the agenda for the ideological discussion in the primary. Health care dominated the first two Democratic debates this summer and will most likely be  prominent again during the third debate on Thursday in Houston. Other candidates support \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d but it is Mr. Sanders who has become singularly identified with it \u2014 \u201cI wrote the damn bill!\u2019\u2019 he proclaimed in July\u2019s debate. A review of hundreds of pages of documents from the first chapters of his political career \u2014 including speeches, correspondences and newspaper clippings \u2014 as well as interviews with those who have known him throughout his life, show that while his democratic socialist worldview underpins his \u201cMedicare for all\u201d pitch, he was also guided by other factors. Chief among them were his mother\u2019s illness and death, which instilled in him the desire  to ensure everyone had access to medical care, and the adjacency of Vermont to Canada, which afforded him a blueprint for universal health care. Together, they help explain why he has staked not only his campaign, but also much of his political legacy, on promoting \u201cMedicare for all.\u2019\u2019 \u201cYou can\u2019t overstate the impact that Vermont\u2019s proximity to Canada had on Bernie\u2019s thinking about how to approach reforming the American health care system,\u201d said Jeff Weaver, who has worked with Mr. Sanders since the 1980s and remains one of his closest advisers. The pull of Canada remains strong: In July, Mr. Sanders took a bus trip from Detroit to Windsor, Ontario, with diabetes patients to highlight lower drug prices in Canada. In an interview on Sunday, Mr. Sanders described how seeing the Canadian system up close significantly shaped his own views on health care. \u201cIt was kind of mind blowing to realize that the country 50 miles away from where I live \u2014 that people could go to the doctor whenever they wanted and not have to take out their wallet,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was just a profound lesson that I learned,\u201d he said. He also criticized the American system as \u201cbarbaric.\u201d And he vowed \u2014 as he often does in his stump speeches \u2014 \u201cto take on the greed and the corruption of the health care industry.\u201d  Mr. Sanders\u2019s health care proposal has attracted legions of supporters fed up with the rising costs of the current system, and it sets him apart from more centrist candidates like Joseph R. Biden Jr. But his uncompromising position also threatens to alienate voters who are pleased with the Affordable Care Act, or who do not want to give up their private insurance. His own state of Vermont so far does not have a single-payer program. Despite skepticism about his views, however, Mr. Sanders has consistently resolved to reform the health care system, even before being elected to public office. In 1972, when he was running for Senate as a candidate from Vermont\u2019s left-wing Liberty Union Party, The Bennington Banner, a local newspaper, reported him taking an uncompromising stance: \u201cThere is absolutely no rational reason, in the United States of America today, we could not have full and total free medical care for all.\u201d The first seeds of Mr. Sanders\u2019s concern were sown in Brooklyn. A high-school track and cross country star with an emerging political streak, Mr. Sanders had wanted to go to Harvard, friends said. But by his senior year, his mother, Dorothy Sanders, had become sick, her heart damaged from having rheumatic fever as a child. As her health declined, her illness consumed him. He stopped going to track practice. To be closer to her, he began his freshman year at Brooklyn College. Mr. Sanders describes his family as lower middle class. His father, an immigrant from Poland, was a paint salesman. He has said his parents frequently argued about money. When his mother fell ill, his family moved her into a charity hospital in New Jersey. After a failed heart surgery, she died in March 1960, when she was in her mid-40s. \u201cBernard actually spent much more time with her than he did in class,\u2019\u2019 his brother, Larry, recalled in an interview in February. \u201cIt was really a kind of wrecked year and a very unhappy year.\u201d Then, as now, Mr. Sanders avoided speaking of his mother\u2019s death. On Sunday, he declined to discuss his personal life, but said that his family had \u201cstruggled economically, and that\u2019s it.\u201d In a 2006 interview with Vermont PBS, he offered a glimpse into how her illness shaped his thinking. \u201cWhen you talk about money and family, how do you get the money for the medical treatment that my mother needed?\u201d he said. \u201cI won\u2019t go into the whole long song and dance of it. But trust me, it was something that I also have not forgotten about \u2014 the right of people to have health care, which was a little bit difficult in our family situation.\u201d  It would still be some years, though, before health care became his political hallmark. Mr. Sanders transferred to the University of Chicago, where he spent hours in the library reading progressive publications that would influence his political views. There, he turned his energy toward civil rights. \u201cWe didn\u2019t talk about health care,\u201d said one of his roommates, Ivan Light. \u201cIt was not on the political agenda at that time. Civil rights was on the agenda.\u201d After moving to Vermont, he became active in politics. A perennial candidate with the Liberty Union Party in the 1970s, he focused on issues like the tax structure. But he also began to study health care seriously. Included in a collection of papers from those days are pamphlets, articles and other material related to medical care. One publication he saved from March 1972 was titled, \u201cHealth Rights News;\u201d its slogan was \u201cHealth care is a human right.\u201d That research soon began to take hold: In October 1976, when he was the Liberty Union candidate for governor, he told The Burlington Free Press that the delivery of medical care was \u201cbasically a national problem\u201d and that he supported \u201cpublic ownership of the drug companies and placing doctors on salaries.\u201d \u201cI believe in socialized medicine,\u201d he said. John Bloch, who has known Mr. Sanders since the 1970s when they were active in Vermont politics, said he thought Mr. Sanders\u2019s views were influenced in part by the people he lived near in the rural town of Stannard, Vt., many of whom were in desperate need of health care. \u201cHe didn\u2019t just come to this as Johnny-come-lately,\u201d Mr. Bloch said. In the interview Sunday, Mr. Sanders said he was particularly affected at the time by a young boy who lived across the road whose teeth, he said, were rotting in his mouth. Deb Richter, a Vermont physician and longtime advocate for single-payer health care, who has worked with Mr. Sanders on the issue for 20 years, said he had always felt that health care was a human right. \u201cYou ask Vermonters, \u2018How long has Bernie been talking about single-payer health care for all?\u2019 and nobody can remember a time he wasn\u2019t talking about it,\u2019\u2019 she said. After Mr. Sanders was elected mayor of Burlington in 1981, he largely emphasized local issues, like property taxes and affordable housing. \u201cI was the mayor of a city of 40,000 people,\u201d Mr. Sanders said in the interview. \u201cTalking about national health care is not exactly what you talk to the board of aldermen about.\u201d By then, he had also become somewhat fixated on Canada. In September 1981, he invited the director of the Quebec Insurance Board to speak about  the province\u2019s health insurance plan. Later, he demanded more accountability from the state\u2019s health insurance company and encouraged a review of hospital budgets.  As he pondered higher office, his focus on health care intensified. Even before he announced his 1986 campaign for governor, he said he planned to run in part on controlling medical costs, according to an article in the Vermont newspaper The Times Argus. He lost that race but gathered valuable information in the process: During his campaign, his team had polled Vermont residents on issues. \u201cTo my surprise,\u201d Mr. Sanders said in 1987, \u201cthe issue that Vermonters felt most strongly about was the rapidly rising costs of health care.\u201d That finding served to galvanize his actions on health care. He quickly set up a task force and charged it with studying how to make the system more affordable. Soon Mr. Sanders and the task force \u2014 which included an expert on the Cuban health care system, professors and a minister \u2014 were traveling to Ottawa, which had  implemented a government-supported, single-payer system. Jed Lowy, who went on the trip, recalled touring a public hospital, visiting a neighborhood community health center and speaking with physicians. \u201cIt was interesting to see another way that health care was provided,\u201d Mr. Lowy said. That trip, and a later one to Montreal, reinforced Mr. Sanders\u2019s idea that Vermont\u2019s northern neighbor had effectively put into practice the kind of accessible, affordable system he had long sought. At a news conference after the Ottawa visit, the task force suggested Burlington could model its health care system after Canada\u2019s. And in unequivocal tones, Mr. Sanders said it would be \u201cabsolutely negligent\u201d not to examine at least some aspects of the Canadian model. In March 1988, the task force released a report recommending the creation of a national health care system. Mr. Sanders\u2019s focus on health care policy met some resistance at home from city employees reluctant to give up benefits they had earned. Mr. Sanders forcefully rebutted the criticism. \u201cYou may regard this as \u2018propaganda\u2019,\u201d he wrote tersely in response to a letter from an angry constituent in December 1982. \u201cI expect that you may not have talked to citizens who are taking their food money to pay for medical care.\u201d By the time Mr. Sanders was mounting his 1988 congressional run, he was speaking about health care in the kind of dogmatic terms he uses today, and he was broadening his vision beyond Vermont. He praised the National League of Cities for adopting a resolution to establish a national health system. Soon after formally announcing his congressional campaign, he set forth his premier agenda item, one that he had imagined since his mother\u2019s death some three decades earlier. \u201cI want to make it emphatically clear,\u201d he said in April 1988, \u201cthat I will make health care reform a top priority as a United States congressman from the state of Vermont.\u201d",

            "content": " LAS VEGAS \u2014 Senator Bernie Sanders introduced a $2.5 trillion housing policy plan on Saturday that would include ending homelessness and limiting rent increases across the country by imposing a national rent control standard. Mr. Sanders said that over the next decade, his plan would expand public housing, increase the availability of affordable housing and cap annual rent increases nationally, regardless of income, at no more than one and a half times the rate of inflation or 3 percent, whichever is higher. His campaign said he would be releasing his full plan within the next month. \u201cWe have an affordable housing crisis in Nevada, in Vermont and all over this country that must be addressed,\u201d he told an audience of about 100 people at a union hall in Las Vegas, which was hit hard by the housing crisis a decade ago. \u201cFor too long, this is one of those issues that we just don\u2019t talk about.\u201d This is the second time in the past 15 days that Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign has teased a policy rollout without releasing an actual proposal. Late last month, the Vermont senator said at a health care-focused event in Florence, S.C., that he planned to introduce legislation that would eliminate all medical debt. His campaign followed his pronouncement with a one-page overview of what the plan would entail, including canceling $81 billion of existing medical debt. The campaign also said at the time that a plan would be released within a month. [Sign up for our politics newsletter hosted by Lisa Lerer and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race.] The series of soft rollouts underscore just how policy focused the Democratic presidential primary has become. Led by Senator Elizabeth Warren, the field has been introducing policy plans at a pace that at times has been frenetic. Mr. Sanders has long advocated for affordable housing, even during his days as mayor of Burlington, Vt., in the 1980s. But though he suggested housing was not a front-burner topic for many politicians, other 2020 candidates have also introduced housing policies. Ms. Warren and Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former housing secretary under President Barack Obama, have already released their own housing proposals. Senator Kamala Harris has also introduced a bill that would allow overburdened renters to access a sliding tax credit based on factors like income and cost of rent. Mr. Sanders said he would pay for the plan by instituting a wealth tax on the top one-tenth of 1 percent of American households, or about 175,000 households, but provided little else in the way of specific details. During his address, part of a weekend swing through Nevada that also featured a rally at the University of Nevada, Reno, on Friday, Mr. Sanders also attacked President Trump and attempted to draw a contrast between his childhood and the president\u2019s more privileged upbringing. \u201cUnlike Donald Trump, I did not grow up in a wealthy family or live in some fancy house,\u201d he said, a thought he has expressed before. In a rare occurrence, Mr. Sanders also mentioned his mother during his address, saying she had always wanted to move out of the three-and-a-half room rent-controlled apartment in Brooklyn, where they lived when he was a boy. \u201cMy mother\u2019s dream was that someday we would move out of that rent-controlled apartment in Brooklyn and we would own a home of our own,\u201d he said. \u201cMy mother died young, and her dream was never fulfilled. But during her life, at least our family was always able to afford a roof over our heads, because we were living in a rent-controlled building, which meant that for our family and all the other families in our building, rents could not be arbitrarily raised.\u201d [Which Democrats are leading the 2020 presidential race this week?] As with many of his proposals, Mr. Sanders acknowledged that the cost of his housing plan would be steep. \u201cI have no doubt that within five minutes after this speech is made public, my critics will be jumping up and down as is usually the case and they will tell you that the plan that I am releasing is expensive,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the truth is it is expensive.\u201d Mr. Sanders also promised to commit $32 billion over five years to end homelessness, and provide outreach services for people experiencing chronic homelessness. He did not say how he would end it; his campaign said more details would be in his full proposal.",

            "content": "  Senator Bernie Sanders has overhauled his New Hampshire state operations five months before the primary, as his campaign fights to maintain support in a state he won by more than 22 percentage points in 2016. In a series of moves, the campaign has replaced the New Hampshire state director, Joe Caiazzo, with Shannon Jackson, who is a member of Mr. Sanders\u2019s inner circle and who led the senator\u2019s re-election campaign in Vermont last year. Mr. Caiazzo, who was Mr. Sanders\u2019s political director in Massachusetts and Rhode Island during the 2016 campaign, has been named state director in Massachusetts. The moves were announced to the campaign\u2019s New Hampshire staff on Sunday. \u201cWe feel really good about where we stand in New Hampshire right now,\u201d said Faiz Shakir, the Sanders campaign manager. \u201cThe poll numbers, the volunteer capacity, the crowds that we have been getting at these events all suggest to us that we are in a very good position.\u201d He added: \u201cObviously, much work to do to continue that trend.\u201d The Sanders campaign also recently shook up its top leadership, promoting both Ari Rabin-Havt, the chief of staff, and Arianna Jones, the communications director, to the position of deputy campaign manager and bringing on a new senior communications adviser. [Here are six takeaways from the September Democratic debate.] Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign said the moves in New Hampshire and elsewhere are an attempt to expand his operations and organize supporters in the northeast as they look beyond the early states toward Super Tuesday, when several other New England states, including Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s state of Massachusetts, will vote. The campaign recently hired a Maine state director, Ben Collings, a member of the Maine Legislature who ran Maine for Mr. Sanders\u2019s 2016 campaign. \u201cThis campaign is building up and spreading out over the next few months,\u201d Mr. Shakir said. But Mr. Sanders\u2019s decision to shake up his campaign in first-in-the-nation New Hampshire, a state he almost certainly must win to have a chance at the nomination, underscores the challenges he faces in recreating the formula from his landslide victory there against Hillary Clinton. Without the same mix of New Hampshire\u2019s anti-establishment and progressive voters all to himself this time, he has fallen into the 20s in most polls, bunched up with Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Ms. Warren at the top of the surveys in the state. The rise of Ms. Warren, in particular, has created difficulties for Mr. Sanders because, like him, she is from a neighboring state and, also like him, appeals to much of the party\u2019s left. Potentially even more threatening, she represents a new alternative for the voters who were mostly aligned with Mr. Sanders in 2016 to oppose Mrs. Clinton. What gets less attention, but which some New Hampshire Democrats say helps explain Mr. Sanders\u2019s challenges there, are the long-shot candidates: Andrew Yang, a former tech entrepreneur, Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii and Marianne Williamson, a best-selling self-help author, are drawing attention from the sort of avant-garde voters who had no such alternative options last cycle other than the Vermont senator. New Hampshire Democrats said Mr. Caiazzo, who grew up in Massachusetts and last year ran the re-election campaign of Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, was a traditional party operative and always something of an unusual fit for Mr. Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist whose campaign is about upending the establishment. And increasingly, Mr. Sanders, in New Hampshire and across the country, is focused less on winning over traditional Democratic activists than he is in mobilizing volunteers as well as new supporters, particularly individuals who have not participated in past primaries, including independents and disaffected Republicans. New Hampshire Democrats also believe that Mr. Sanders did not have the sort of organization befitting the candidate who had won the state so overwhelmingly three years ago. Mr. Jackson, who was previously the Sanders campaign\u2019s northeast regional director, has worked with Mr. Sanders for years, including in his senate office in Burlington, Vt. He also helped start Our Revolution, the senator\u2019s political advocacy group. In a statement, Mr. Jackson said he was \u201chonored to be taking on a more direct role in this critically important state\u201d and praised the team there. The campaign said it had recently added a campus outreach director and labor outreach director in New Hampshire as well. Glenn Thrush contributed reporting.",

            "author": "Emily Badger",
            "content": " Bernie Sanders has gone much further than any of the other 2020 Democratic presidential candidates in proposing not just more money for affordable housing, or more enforcement of fair-housing laws, but also fundamental changes in how the housing market functions. His most startling ideas \u2014 a national rent control standard, and new taxes on land speculation and house \u201cflipping\u201d \u2014 would bring America closer to the idea that housing should be treated as shelter and not a commodity. But in the housing plan his campaign released Wednesday, Mr. Sanders doesn\u2019t go all the way there. He allows for profit, but not certain kinds of profit, or profit by certain kinds of actors. In that middle ground, somewhere between the private market and social housing for all, things get complicated. The national rent control standard Mr. Sanders has proposed would cap the amount that landlords can raise rents, to shield tenants from escalating housing costs and, in a deeper sense, the excesses of capitalism in the housing market. Landlords could raise the rent by no more than 3 percent per year, or one and a half times the rate of inflation, whichever is higher. His housing plan says nothing about the profits of people buying and selling homes in the normal course of homeownership. In fact, Mr. Sanders would invest an additional $8 billion into federal programs to help first-time home buyers, precisely because homeownership in America is often a means of building wealth. Between the two proposals lies a fraught balance: One would curb profits in the housing market, while the other acknowledges that many Americans depend on those profits. Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign seeks to reconcile the two by arguing that rich investors or landlords shouldn\u2019t get to make so much, while ordinary American families should have a chance to make something. \u201cWe want to return to the notion that homeownership can be an asset builder for working people and average American families, and it is not just a vehicle to commodify to make the rich richer,\u201d said Josh Orton, a senior adviser to the Sanders campaign and its national policy director. In practice, however, it\u2019s not always obvious how to distinguish the working families from the rich investors, or how to devise policies that crack down on the one but not the other. Some middle-class families, for example, build wealth by owning rental properties. And landlord groups are skeptical that 3 percent rent increases would build them much wealth, especially when property taxes, insurance rates and utilities aren\u2019t also capped. Mr. Sanders\u2019s proposal would also put a hefty tax on house flipping, hitting owners who sell a property for more than the original price within five years of purchase (for a place they don\u2019t occupy). But that definition would cover people we don\u2019t think of as flippers: a small-scale general contractor who remodels two homes a year; a family that buys a home for an aging parent who later dies; a landlord who herself faces financial distress and must get out of the business. Mr. Sanders has similarly proposed a tax on empty homes, aimed at speculators who sit on vacant properties until they become more lucrative to redevelop, or simply profitable to resell. That is a real problem in some communities, leaving neighbors to live with blight for years. But owning an empty home doesn\u2019t necessarily make you a speculator. Someone who has put a property on the market and struggled to sell it for months might end up facing this tax. The full proposal, emphasizing the feel-good parts of the market but not the others, is trying to have it both ways, said Jenny Schuetz, a housing economist at the Brookings Institution who has been following housing proposals from the 2020 candidates. \u201cIn some ideal universe, people would buy homes (or rental properties) that appreciated slightly faster than inflation, allowing them to build wealth, but without housing costs rising too fast to pressure renters, deter new homeowners, or create excess capital gains,\u201d Ms. Schuetz wrote in an email. \u201cIn that context, both rent control and flipping taxes make sense. The problem is, with any semblance of a private real estate market, land and housing values don\u2019t behave that way.\u201d She is skeptical that it is even possible to design or regulate a market that gives modest returns to individual homeowners, but never gives big returns to landlords; that penalizes greedy flippers, but never harms small-time contractors; that taxes vacant homes but doesn\u2019t punish working families. Mr. Sanders\u2019s ideas invite a host of questions about how they would technically work (how do we police a million landlords?) and where their legal authority would come from (would the courts uphold a national rent control law?). But these deeper questions about the kind of housing market voters might want seem worth hashing out, regardless of those other details. Mr. Orton, the Sanders adviser, pushed back against the logic of economists that, for one, rent control discourages developers from building and landlords from renting housing that Americans badly need. \u201cI would say to those economists, how is that working out?\u201d he said of the current deference to the market. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing. When we\u2019ve left this to private developers, everything from the crash of the housing market to how we\u2019ve seen gentrification just explode in some of the most vulnerable communities, to how we\u2019ve seen people priced out of what would normally be affordable housing \u2014 this current crisis is the result of that.\u201d",

            "content": " CHAPEL HILL, N.C. \u2014 College students are back on campus. Bernie Sanders is, too. Earlier this month at Iowa State University, he lectured to young voters as they played \u201cGreen New Deal Pong\u201d (the Solo cups were filled with green-colored water) and \u201cBern Bag Toss.\u201d At the University of Nevada, Reno, he croaked through a hoarse voice to address a crowd that stretched from the college lawn to the open-air floors of a parking garage beside it. And at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill on Thursday evening, he implored students to get themselves to the primary polls come February \u2014 and vote for him. \u201cYou have friends out there, and I know you do, who think that the political system\u201d is absurd, he said, using a colorful expletive. \u201cTell them that instead of just complaining, they must get involved into the political process.\u201d It was a sentiment he has repeated often this month as he crisscrossed the country on what has amounted to a whirlwind back-to-school tour. In Iowa, Nevada, North Carolina and South Carolina, he has by turns used flattery (\u201cYour generation is the most progressive younger generation in the history of this country\u201d) and subtle warnings (\u201cThe future of this country and in fact the world rests with your generation\u201d) to bolster his appeals. Everywhere, his goal was the same: muster a version of the army of young voters who propelled his campaign in 2016. His message was one that has resonated with Brianna Williams, 19, who arrived with a group of friends to hear him in Chapel Hill. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of his policies, and I\u2019m just excited for what he has to offer as a candidate,\u201d she said. But she was just as excited by Senator Elizabeth Warren. \u201cI would love to see a woman running the country,\u201d she said. \u201cThat would be really cool.\u201d Last time around, Mr. Sanders\u2019s rants against the elite and promises of free college tuition endeared him to legions of young fans. It also helped that Mr. Sanders \u2014 74 at the time, with unruly white hair and an old-school Brooklyn accent \u2014 was both decidedly uncool and new to presidential politics, affording his campaign a paradoxical edge that inspired millions of young supporters to \u201cfeel the bern\u201d and vote for him over Hillary Clinton. As he fights anew for the Democratic nomination, it is not lost on him or his allies that his success hinges, in no small part, on his ability to capture that enthusiasm again \u2014 for both the optics of his race and the actual votes. But this time he is no longer an insurgent, nor is he the only anti-establishment candidate in the race \u2014 factors that helped boost his standing among young voters. With the race entering the crucial fall period, other candidates, including Ms. Warren and Andrew Yang, have begun siphoning off some of his support. [Sign up for our politics newsletter hosted by Lisa Lerer and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race.] Even Mr. Sanders\u2019s closest advisers acknowledge that he cannot take for granted a voting cohort they view as critical, even if it is traditionally unreliable in actually making it to the ballot box. \u201cLast time it was much more organic,\u201d Faiz Shakir, Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign manager, said. \u201cAnd this time it\u2019s far more intentional.\u201d In interviews, many young voters still praised Mr. Sanders, sometimes breathlessly \u2014 citing his authenticity and conviction but also his calls for free college and universal health care and his proposal to cancel student debt. But many also expressed curiosity, if not exuberance, about other candidates \u201cI love everything he stands for,\u201d said Asha Loutsch, 18, as she sat with a circle of friends who were waiting for his event at the University of Iowa. \u201cI think he really cares about what he\u2019s trying to say. Like, he\u2019s always getting up in there, you know?\u201d But she also said she was interested in Ms. Warren and wanted to hear her speak. Jiego Lim, an 18-year-old student at the University of Nevada, Reno, who was volunteering at Mr. Sanders\u2019s event there, said he supported Mr. Sanders but was also intrigued by Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Senator Kamala Harris. \u201cI feel like we need a fresh new face in politics,\u201d he said. \u201cBernie comes off aggressive to me sometimes.\u201d Others were less equivocal. \u201cHe\u2019s America\u2019s dad,\u201d offered Gabriel Olier, 19, a student in Reno. \u201cI love Bernie.\u201d That affection for Mr. Sanders is reflected in some more tangible metrics. His campaign said it had so far raised over $1 million from people under the age of 25, a relatively small figure compared to his overall haul but one that nevertheless points to his continued strength with young voters. [Here\u2019s the latest data on who\u2019s leading the race to be the Democratic nominee.] And in most polls, Mr. Sanders still maintains a strong lead among young voters: A recent NBC/Wall Street Journal survey showed that a third of voters under 35 supported him. Yet at the same time, a quarter of these respondents said they supported Ms. Warren, suggesting Mr. Sanders no longer has the same hold on the group he had in 2016. Any candidate relying on the support of younger voters faces an undeniable challenge: Younger voters tend not to vote in high numbers compared with other groups. In the 2016 election, for instance, only 11 percent of voters under 30 participated in the Iowa caucuses, representing just 15 percent of the total, according to an estimate from the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts University. But the high turnout among young voters during the 2018 midterm elections has given some experts hope that the 2020 election will be different. That strong showing has provided organizers with a larger pool to identify and target potential presidential voters. Issues, including climate change, criminal justice, health care and gun control, are also motivating young voters to act. \u201cThe truth is that if younger people in this country voted at the same level as people 65 and over, we could transform this country,\u201d Mr. Sanders said this month at the University of Iowa. \u201cPlease do it!\u201d John Della Volpe, the director of polling at Harvard\u2019s Institute of Politics, said that Mr. Sanders was still \u201cdoing really well\u201d but that the field was more complex and his pool of support was smaller. \u201cAt this stage, he\u2019s essentially sharing support of young people in most polls with Elizabeth Warren,\u201d Mr. Della Volpe said. \u201cThe idea of going after structural reforms is really, I think, what is resonating so clearly with young people.\u201d Indeed, of all the other candidates, it is Ms. Warren who appears to be generating the most powerful wave of energy among young voters in Democratic presidential politics \u2014 particularly among those who once supported Mr. Sanders. Olivia Stecklein, 19, a student at the University of Iowa, said she had been a fan of Mr. Sanders since 2015 but was now choosing between him and Ms. Warren. \u201cI feel like they\u2019re pretty similar, but I just kind of like how Elizabeth Warren has a set-out plan for everything,\u201d she said. \u201cShe just seems very prepared.\u201d Eliza Link, 18, a University of Iowa student, said she was also deciding between Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren. \u201cI think they\u2019re both the cool aunt and uncle of the political race right now,\u201d she said. With his characteristic verve that can exhaust even young reporters, Mr. Sanders has been in an all-out sprint to earn the vote of the youths, months before any of them can even cast their vote. His team set up a Bernie Summer School program to train campus leaders in the art of campaigning. He urged his campaign to get him back on college campuses in the first weeks of the new school year. He constantly asks his team to share data on young voters. To win over the group, however, Mr. Sanders will have to convince people like Tim Watts, 19. Before Mr. Sanders\u2019s event in Reno, Mr. Watts wore a \u201cMATH\u201d hat, the universal accessory of Yang supporters. But despite his overt support for Mr. Yang \u2014 who in some ways is benefiting from the outsider status among young voters that Mr. Sanders enjoyed in 2016 \u2014 Mr. Watts said he had not yet closed the door on Mr. Sanders. \u201cI\u2019m part of the Yang gang, I guess,\u201d he said. \u201cI will probably feel the bern later.\u201d",

            "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Senator Bernie Sanders on Tuesday unveiled a proposal to create a new tax on the wealth of the richest Americans, including a steep tax on billionaires that could greatly diminish their fortunes. With the proposal, Mr. Sanders is embracing an idea that has been a centerpiece of the campaign of his top progressive rival, Senator Elizabeth Warren. But while Ms. Warren came first, Mr. Sanders is going bigger. His wealth tax would apply to a larger number of households, impose a higher top rate and raise more money. Mr. Sanders\u2019s plan to tax accumulated wealth, not just income, is particularly aggressive in how it would erode the fortunes of billionaires. His tax would cut in half the wealth of the typical billionaire after 15 years, according to two economists who worked with the Sanders campaign on the plan. Mr. Sanders would use the money generated by his wealth tax to fund the housing plan he released last week and a forthcoming plan for universal child care, as well as to help pay for \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d \u201cLet me be very clear: As president of the United States, I will reduce the outrageous and grotesque and immoral level of income and wealth inequality,\u201d Mr. Sanders said in an interview. \u201cWhat we are trying to do is demand and implement a policy which significantly reduces income and wealth inequality in America by telling the wealthiest families in this country they cannot have so much wealth.\u201d Asked if he thought billionaires should exist in the United States, Mr. Sanders said, \u201cI hope the day comes when they don\u2019t.\u201d He added, \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be tomorrow.\u201d [Sign up for our politics newsletter and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race.] \u201cI don\u2019t think that billionaires should exist,\u201d he said, adding that there would always be rich people and others with less money. \u201cThis proposal does not eliminate billionaires, but it eliminates a lot of the wealth that billionaires have, and I think that\u2019s exactly what we should be doing.\u201d The proposal from Mr. Sanders is the latest sign of the push in the Democratic Party to collect substantially more revenue from the wealthiest Americans by rethinking how they are taxed \u2014 a move that could provide large sums of money to finance new social programs. And it is a significant development in the competition of ideas between Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren, the two leading progressive candidates in the Democratic primary race. Both of their plans would need to be passed by Congress in order to take effect \u2014 a virtual impossibility unless Democrats win control of the Senate in the 2020 elections, and far from a sure thing even then. Ms. Warren\u2019s plan touched off a number of questions about the feasibility of creating a wealth tax, including whether such a tax would be constitutional, how it would be enforced and whether it would generate as much money as has been projected. On Tuesday, Ms. Warren welcomed Mr. Sanders\u2019s plan. \u201cI\u2019m delighted to see people talking about a wealth tax,\u201d she told WBUR. \u201cI think it\u2019s great because this is how we make big structural change in this economy. We need all of the presidential candidates talking about it; where are the rest of them?\u201d Mr. Sanders, of Vermont, would create an annual tax that would apply to households with a net worth above $32 million \u2014 about 180,000 households in total, or about the top 0.1 percent, according to the economists who worked on the plan. He would impose a 1 percent tax on net worth above $32 million, with increasing marginal rates topping out at 8 percent on net worth over $10 billion. For single filers, the brackets would be halved, meaning the tax would kick in at $16 million. By contrast, the wealth tax proposed by Ms. Warren, of Massachusetts, would apply to households with a net worth above $50 million \u2014 an estimated 70,000 households in total. The structure of her plan is simpler: She would apply a 2 percent tax on net worth from $50 million to $1 billion, and a 3 percent tax on net worth above $1 billion. Unlike the Sanders plan, the tax brackets would be the same for married and single filers. Mr. Sanders\u2019s tax is projected to raise $4.35 trillion over a decade, while Ms. Warren\u2019s is projected to raise $2.6 trillion over the same time period. Those estimates were produced by Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, two economists at the University of California, Berkeley, with whom both the Sanders and Warren campaigns consulted as they developed their proposals. (The projection for Ms. Warren\u2019s plan differs slightly from their original estimate of $2.75 trillion earlier this year.) \u201cThe Sanders plan is really pitched at the idea that we don\u2019t want billionaires and decabillionaires to be billionaires and decabillionaires for as long as they currently are,\u201d Mr. Saez said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to erode their fortunes much faster than the Warren wealth tax.\u201d Mr. Sanders included several steps in his plan to enforce the tax, including creating a \u201cnational wealth registry,\u201d increasing funding for the Internal Revenue Service and requiring audits of many taxpayers who are subject to the wealth tax, including all billionaires. Mr. Saez and Mr. Zucman calculated how the Warren and Sanders wealth taxes would have affected the fortunes of the richest Americans had each been in effect since 1982. The fortune of Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder who Forbes said was worth $160 billion last year, would have been $87 billion under the Warren plan and $43 billion under the Sanders plan. Over all, the economists found, the cumulative wealth of the top 15 richest Americans in 2018 \u2014 amounting to $943 billion, using estimates from Forbes \u2014 would have been $434 billion under the Warren plan and $196 billion under the Sanders plan. Mr. Sanders is hardly a newcomer to the idea of a wealth tax. In a 1997 book, he wrote that it was \u201ctime, high time, to establish a tax on wealth similar to those that exist in most European countries.\u201d In 2017, he included a wealth tax on a list of financing options for Medicare for all. Ms. Warren was quick to harness the idea in the 2020 race. She released her wealth tax proposal in January, weeks before Mr. Sanders began his campaign. Since then, the proposal has become a cornerstone of Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign and a fixture of her stump speech, even prompting chants of \u201cTwo cents!\u201d from crowds. The money from her tax would go toward other policy plans she has issued, including her proposals for universal child care, student debt cancellation and tuition-free public college.",

            "author": "Margot Sanger-Katz",
            "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 Bernie Sanders has long wanted to remake the health care system so no one will have to pay directly for medical care again. Now, he also wants to go back and cancel all the medical debts of people who have been billed under the current system. In a plan released Saturday, Mr. Sanders, the Vermont senator and presidential candidate, proposes wiping out an estimated $81 billion in existing debt and changing rules around debt collection and bankruptcy. He also calls for replacing the giant credit reporting agencies with a \u201cpublic credit registry\u201d that would ignore medical debt when calculating credit scores. The proposals reflect Mr. Sanders\u2019s concern that the medical system has placed financial hardships on too many Americans, by discouraging them from seeking needed medical care \u2014 but also by saddling them with expensive and unfair bills that can harm their financial security, ding their credit and, in some cases, lead to bankruptcy. The plan is Mr. Sanders\u2019s latest effort to transform the health care system in America, a goal on which he has staked not just his second presidential run, but much of his political legacy. His proposal also separates him from other presidential candidates: While several of them have come to embrace his \u201cMedicare for all\u201d plan to create a government-run health insurance system, he is the first top-tier contender to call for such drastic measures on medical debt. \u201cWe\u2019re addressing it on both ends,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cWe\u2019re addressing it now by trying to help the people who have past due medical bills. And we\u2019re addressing it by finally creating a health care system that guarantees coverage to people without any premiums, without any deductibles, without any out-of-pocket expenses.\u201d [Sign up for our politics newsletter and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race.] Medical debt affects Americans who lack health insurance, of course. But it is also increasingly affecting people who have insurance with holes, like high deductibles or limited networks of doctors whose care is paid for. Around 16 percent of adults with credit reports have at least one medical debt, according to a study published last year in the journal Health Affairs. The plan calls for the government to negotiate and cancel the debts, though it does not specify the precise mechanism. While eliminating every American\u2019s medical debt would probably not come cheap, Mr. Sanders\u2019s plan could wind up costing far less than the total amount of debt he is seeking to cancel. Craig Antico, a founder of the charity RIP Medical Debt, which buys and forgives medical debt, estimated that the market price for $81 billion in debt could be as low as $500 million. Most past-due medical debt never gets paid, which is why bill collectors are often willing to sell the debts for pennies on the dollar. The plan would also create a public credit rating agency to \u201creplace\u201d for-profit companies like Equifax, and it would exclude medical debts from credit ratings. It would establish a new legal process, managed by the bankruptcy court system, to help adjudicate medical debts that are not yet in collections. Studies suggest that medical debts can be less damaging to people\u2019s credit than other kinds of debt, in part because the credit reporting agencies treat people\u2019s ability to pay medical bills as less predictive of creditworthiness than, say, their ability to pay credit card bills or car payments. And, despite the news media\u2019s focus on particularly large medical bills, the typical bill in collections is less than $600, according to the Health Affairs article. But medical debts do affect credit somewhat, and they can cause psychological stress, beyond the financial consequences. A survey of people with medical debts conducted by The New York Times and the Kaiser Family Foundation in 2016 found that 44 percent of adults under 65 who had problems paying medical bills said those bills had a \u201cmajor effect\u201d on their lives. Fear of medical debts causes some people to avoid needed medical care. And medical bills can affect other parts of people\u2019s finances that are harder to measure, showing up as an unpaid credit card bill or a missed loan payment. \u201cI have a belief that if a plan like this could eliminate the debt that\u2019s causing hardship, it could make a huge difference in people\u2019s lives,\u201d Mr. Antico said. The Sanders campaign circulated statistics suggesting that more than 500,000 Americans declare bankruptcy each year because of medical bills. That number, derived from a survey of bankrupt individuals, overstates the impact of medical bills on bankruptcy. The study itself noted that health problems can cause bankruptcies in two ways, through direct medical bills and through lost income due to illness itself. The 500,000 figure includes both groups. Other research has shown that income losses due to illness are often the bigger financial hit than medical bills. Neither Mr. Sanders\u2019s \u201cMedicare for all\u201d plan nor his medical debt program would address that secondary issue, though he has also called for guaranteeing workers paid medical leave.  The plan \u201cis well targeted,\u201d said Neale Mahoney, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago, who studies medical debt. \u201cIt just may not be that much relief.\u201d [Which Democrats are leading the 2020 presidential race this week?] Mr. Sanders said that, in conversations with people around the country, he had come to see medical debt as the most consistent and visceral manifestation of a broken health care system. At an event this month in Carson City, Nev., for instance, he heard from a veteran who said he had $139,000 in medical debt. When Mr. Sanders asked the man how he would pay off the debt, the man responded: \u201cI can\u2019t. I can\u2019t. I\u2019m going to kill myself.\u201d Those kinds of deeply moving moments, he said, drove him to seek a new way to ameliorate that particular pain as part of his overall vision for changing the health care system. \u201cI have always believed that health care is a human right, and it has always disturbed me immensely that so many of our people are uninsured or underinsured and can\u2019t go to the doctor,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cBut I have learned in this campaign something else, which I didn\u2019t talk about previously, and that is the financial pain that this dysfunctional health care system is causing people.\u201d The new plan is part of a burst of policy-related activity from the Sanders campaign, which also released a housing plan last week that included a proposal to establish a national rent control standard.",

            "content": "  BURLINGTON, Vt. \u2014 Senator Bernie Sanders, in a striking concession for a leading presidential candidate, said on Tuesday that he planned to slow down his pace on the campaign trail after suffering a heart attack a week ago, and acknowledged that voters would likely consider his health when deciding whether to support him. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to change the nature of the campaign a bit,\u201d Mr. Sanders told reporters after a visit with a local cardiologist. \u201cMake sure that I have the strength to do what I have to do.\u201d Mr. Sanders\u2019s remarks stood in sharp contrast with comments in recent days from his campaign advisers, who have insisted that the Vermont senator was neither changing course nor easing his trademark intensity as a result of the heart attack. Given Mr. Sanders\u2019s influential role in the Democratic race, not only as a top candidate but also as a driving force in policy debates, his decision to pull back campaigning injects new uncertainty into the contest \u2014 both for the future of Mr. Sanders\u2019s candidacy and the possible ramifications for other contenders. In recent weeks, the race has become more of a two-person contest between Senator Elizabeth Warren, a fellow liberal who shares many of the same goals as Mr. Sanders, and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., whose policy positions are generally more moderate. Ms. Warren has risen steadily in many polls while both Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders have lost some ground, particularly in surveys of Iowa voters, who will hold the first nominating contest in February. Pollsters said on Tuesday that it was too soon to determine or measure the impact of Mr. Sanders\u2019s health issues on voter preferences in the race, but they noted that his admission about his health would create a new challenge for Mr. Sanders, who, at 78, would be the oldest president ever elected by far. \u200b\u201cThis will just raise the issue of his age\u200b, which to me has always been the Achilles\u2019 heel of the Sanders campaign,\u201d said Andrew Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center, which polls public opinion in the key primary state. \u201cWhen Sanders ran for president in 2016, he was the not-Hillary Clinton candidate and no one paid attention to how old he is. Now, there will be a lot of attention to how old he is, and how old Joe Biden is.\u201d Mr. Biden is 76, while Ms. Warren is 70. President Trump is 73. Speaking to reporters outside his home in Burlington Tuesday, Mr. Sanders gave no indication that he was planning to drop out of the race and said he would continue to campaign actively. Indeed, Mr. Sanders remains formidable: He reported a third-quarter fund-raising total of $25.3 million, the largest in the Democratic field, and he has helped steer many in the party to embrace ideas like \u201cMedicare for all\u201d and tuition-free public colleges. Mr. Sanders has been campaigning almost nonstop when not carrying out his Senate duties in Washington, D.C., a pace that he pointedly noted on Tuesday. \u201cWe were doing, you know, in some cases five or six meetings a day, three or four rallies and town meetings and meeting with groups of people,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to do that.\u201d \u201cI think we\u2019re going to change the nature of the campaign a bit,\u201d he added. \u201cMake sure that I have the strength to do what I have to do.\u201d Asked to clarify what he meant when he said the campaign would change, he replied: \u201cProbably not doing four rallies a day.\u201d Standing next to his wife, Jane, Mr. Sanders also acknowledged that his heart attack could be a factor for voters considering whether to support him. \u201cEverything that happens every day weighs on how people feel about you,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd my own view is that \u2014 and I think it\u2019s the voters\u2019 view \u2014 you look at the totality of who a candidate is. You look at what that candidate stands for, the integrity of that candidate, the history of that candidate.\u201d It has been a difficult week for the Sanders family: In addition to Mr. Sanders\u2019s heart attack, his daughter-in-law Rain\u00e8 Riggs died at age 46, shortly after she was diagnosed with neuroendocrine cancer, according to a death notice. Ms. Riggs was the wife of Levi Sanders, Mr. Sanders\u2019s son. Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign aides were heartened that the first polls since his hospitalization did not show a significant drop in his support. But the candidate and his wife have not been revealing much to the public, or even some of his own staff, about when he would get back to the campaign trail and how aggressive he would be once he does return. It is now almost certain that he will have a far more difficult path to the nomination. Democrats are overwhelmingly focused on finding a candidate they believe can defeat Mr. Trump, having made clear in surveys that ousting a president they loathe is their top priority. Now, in addition to questions about whether he is too far to the left to win over general election voters, Mr. Sanders will have to face doubts about his physical capabilities. Further, unlike in 2016, progressive voters have an alternative to Mr. Sanders in this race. While some of his bedrock supporters will not abandon him, other left-wing voters will gladly cast a vote for Ms. Warren. That was not the case when Mr. Sanders faced Mrs. Clinton in the last primary. Mr. Sanders returned to Burlington over the weekend, after spending three days in a hospital in Las Vegas. His campaign said he felt chest pains during an event last Tuesday, and he was taken to the hospital, where two stents were inserted into an artery. Since then, his campaign has insisted that Mr. Sanders does not intend to drop out of the race. During a telephone call with staff members on Monday, Mr. Sanders said he felt \u201cmore strongly about the need for a political revolution today than I did when I began this campaign.\u201d Jane Sanders, who remains one of Mr. Sanders\u2019s closest advisers, said that idea was \u201csomething that the entire campaign, and especially me, have been saying for months \u2014 not for his health but for the ability to keep up that kind of a pace for everybody else, too.\u201d Campaign officials also downplayed Mr. Sanders\u2019s remarks. \u201cAs Bernie said, we are going to have an active campaign,\u201d Faiz Shakir, Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign manager, said in a statement on Tuesday evening. \u201cInstead of a breakneck series of events that lap the field, we are going to keep a marathoner\u2019s pace that still manages to outrun everyone else.\u201d Another adviser, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive topic, said Mr. Sanders had been thinking about changing the pace of his campaign schedule for some time, and aides discussed this with him when he was in the hospital. Known for keeping a grueling schedule on the campaign trail, Mr. Sanders, who finished second to Mrs. Clinton in the 2016 primary, will often crisscross a state with multiple stops for big rallies and smaller town hall-style events and gatherings. There is no recent precedent for a candidate to suffer such a serious health setback in the midst of a campaign, at least not since President Dwight D. Eisenhower suffered a heart attack in the fall of 1955, a year before his re-election. Mrs. Clinton stayed off the campaign trail for three days in the fall of 2016 after she felt dizzy at a 9/11 commemoration but was only diagnosed with pneumonia. In 1999, former Senator Bill Bradley was briefly sidelined as he sought the Democratic nomination because he had an irregular heartbeat. Mr. Bradley, a former professional basketball player who was only 56 at the time, returned to the campaign trail but was dogged by questions about his health and was beaten decisively by Al Gore.",

            "content": "  Senator Bernie Sanders was recovering in a Las Vegas hospital on Wednesday after being treated for blockage of an artery, forcing him to cancel his events in the coming days and casting uncertainty over a candidacy already struggling to win new voters. Mr. Sanders, 78, experienced \u201csome chest discomfort\u201d at an event Tuesday night, said Jeff Weaver, a longtime adviser; a medical evaluation found blockage in one artery, and two stents were inserted. Mr. Sanders\u2019s hospitalization is likely to intensify the focus on age in the Democratic race, even as much of the public debate has centered on policies like health care and immigration. The three leading Democratic candidates, as well as the president they are vying to challenge, are all in their 70s. One of those Democrats, Joseph R. Biden Jr., 76, has drawn his own age-related scrutiny because of his sometimes rambling discourses and uneven answers in debates. Campaign aides did not provide any further information about Mr. Sanders\u2019s condition and they have not said whether he had suffered a heart attack or whether he was just experiencing chest pain. Late Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Sanders posted a tweet thanking his well wishers and using the incident as an opportunity to plug his signature policy proposal, \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d Inserting stents into arteries is common in the United States \u2014 there are at least 600,000 such procedures a year, and perhaps up to one million. It is usually uncomplicated, and patients return home within a day or two. \u201cThe prognosis is very good,\u201d said Dr. Steven Nissen, chief academic officer of the Heart and Vascular Institute at the Cleveland Clinic. \u201cMost patients are home the next day and back to work very quickly.\u201d He said he did not see it as an impediment to returning to the campaign trail. Still, it is unclear when Mr. Sanders will return to the campaign trail or whether he will be able to participate in the next Democratic debate, on Oct. 15 in Westerville, Ohio, near Columbus. [Have you or your loved ones had experience with stents? We want to hear how it may have affected your life and work. Please share your story in the comments.] Mr. Sanders\u2019s heart issue could prove to be a political problem for him, and it has the potential to change the dynamic of a still-fluid Democratic race. Mr. Sanders has largely avoided scrutiny of his age and his health. But he and his rivals will now be under increasing pressure to release detailed medical records as Democratic voters try to settle on the best candidate to take on President Trump, who is himself 73. Mr. Sanders, Mr. Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is 70, have all said they would release their records before the first voting starts in February. When Mr. Sanders returns to the campaign, he may find what was already his biggest challenge \u2014 finding new converts to his mission \u2014 to be even more difficult. \u201cI do think this makes it harder for him to persuade new supporters to come into his column because this will at least be in the back of people\u2019s minds,\u201d said Erik Smith, a longtime Democratic strategist. The setback with his health also comes amid something of a political slump for Mr. Sanders in his second run for the presidency. He has continued to raise substantial amounts of money from his dedicated supporters \u2014 on Tuesday, his campaign celebrated an impressive third-quarter fund-raising haul of $25.3 million \u2014 and has remained among the top three contenders in the primary. But he has been unable to expand his base beyond those enthusiasts. In recent weeks, he shook up his staff in Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two nominating states, in an effort to jump-start his candidacy as Ms. Warren passed him in some polls. Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign Wednesday said he began experiencing chest pain during a campaign event on Tuesday night in Las Vegas, where he had traveled for a series of appearances. He had visited an outdoor memorial dedicated to victims of the city\u2019s 2017 mass shooting and had hosted a grass-roots fund-raiser at the Shiraz restaurant. The restaurant\u2019s owner, Raja Majid, said in a phone interview Wednesday that Mr. Sanders had spoken to a crowd of about 250 people. As Mr. Sanders began taking questions from the audience, he asked a staff member for a chair, an unusual request from a candidate who typically stands or paces onstage. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long day here,\u201d he said. On Wednesday, Mr. Weaver spoke only in general terms about Mr. Sanders\u2019s prognosis. \u201cSenator Sanders is conversing and in good spirits,\u201d he said in the statement. \u201cHe will be resting up over the next few days. We are canceling his events and appearances until further notice, and we will continue to provide appropriate updates.\u201d Mr. Sanders was to travel to California and Iowa later this week.  Mr. Sanders\u2019s allies quickly downplayed his procedure. RoseAnn DeMoro, a former leader of a nurse\u2019s union and longtime Sanders surrogate, said \u201cthere are numerous presidents who have had heart problems and heart problems far worse\u201d than what Mr. Sanders experienced Wednesday. Yet many Democratic voters have expressed discomfort with nominating a candidate in their 70s. A Pew survey in May indicated that only 3 percent of Democratic voters believed the best age range for a president to be in was in their 70s. Forty-seven percent of those surveyed said they preferred a president in their 50s. \u201cI\u2019m not an ageist, and I never have been, but as I get older I realize the limitations of getting older, and I can\u2019t even begin to imagine the strain of being president of the United States,\u201d said Steve Horner, 68, a retired special education teacher from Las Vegas who travels with a portable oxygen unit to help him breathe. \u201cI think it does matter,\u201d added Mr. Horner, who said he had not picked a candidate yet. Others acknowledged that age was an issue, but not the pre-eminent one. \u201cWould I prefer someone who is younger? Yes, but it\u2019s not our top thing,\u201d Elizabeth Bennett, 54, said at a gun safety forum in Las Vegas. On the campaign trail, each of the three septuagenarian Democrats has sought to project an image of good health, with Ms. Warren making a point to jog to the stage of her campaign events and Mr. Biden running through parades. The onetime captain of his high school track team, Mr. Sanders has done the same. He has pursued a blistering campaign schedule often characterized by multiple stops a day, and has been loath to take time off from the trail. He pitched in the softball game his campaign staged over the summer on Iowa\u2019s \u201cField of Dreams,\u201d and his aides have released other images of him playing catch or basketball. Mr. Sanders\u2019s events are usually high-energy affairs, where he regales enthusiastic crowds with his calls for \u201cMedicare for all\u201d and rails against the corporate and Washington elite. In recent weeks, he has struggled with hoarseness, which forced him to cancel several events last month, but he then returned to the campaign trail. In March, he hit his head on the edge of a glass shower door, requiring seven stitches. The Sanders campaign had planned to go on air with his first television ads of the campaign this week in Iowa, announcing a two-week $1.3 million buy on Tuesday. His campaign said on Wednesday that it was postponing those ads. The procedure Mr. Sanders had is generally not considered dangerous. Stents are tiny metal tube-shaped cages used to widen arteries in which blood flow has become impeded. They are inserted into coronary arteries when patients are suffering from angina, which is pain that results from clogged vessels, or heart attacks, in which blood flow is completely blocked. Dr. Gilbert Tang, a heart surgeon at the Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, said that if Mr. Sanders\u2019s heart was not damaged, he should make a full recovery. But he also sounded a note of caution, saying the risks depended on which artery was blocked: \u201cWe don\u2019t know what the anatomy looks like and what kind of stent at what location,\u201d he said. During his first presidential run, Mr. Sanders released a letter from his doctor declaring that he was in \u201cvery good health.\u201d The letter stated that Mr. Sanders had suffered several ailments during his life, including gout and diverticulitis. The letter also said Mr. Sanders had normal readings for blood pressure, pulse and blood count and that he had no history of cardiovascular disease.",

            "content": " Senator Bernie Sanders, recovering in a Las Vegas hospital from a procedure to treat a clogged artery, should be able to return home by the end of this weekend and will participate in the next Democratic debate, his wife, Jane Sanders, said Thursday. \u201cBernie is up and about,\u201d Ms. Sanders said in a statement on Thursday. \u201cWe expect Bernie will be discharged and on a plane back to Burlington before the end of the weekend.\u201d Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign has declined to say whether he had suffered a heart attack, and his wife\u2019s statement did not address that. On Wednesday, Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign said he experienced \u201csome chest discomfort\u201d during an event on Tuesday evening; a medical evaluation found blockage in one artery, and two stents were inserted. He has canceled a two-day college tour this week in California, and his aides have not said when he would return to the campaign trail. Placing stents in arteries is a common procedure, and patients generally return home within a day or two. Ms. Sanders did not specify whether Mr. Sanders, 78, would be discharged sooner than the weekend and would remain in Las Vegas before returning home. Dr. Brahmajee Nallamothu, an interventional cardiologist at the University of Michigan, said it is hard to read too much into Mr. Sanders\u2019s apparently prolonged hospital stay. If a blood vessel\u2019s anatomy is complex, he said, cardiologists might keep a patient for an extra day. But a stay of several days, he said, \u201cis not typical unless there is an additional issue.\u201d Dr. Nallamothu said he had watched a video of Mr. Sanders\u2019s event at a Las Vegas restaurant Tuesday night when the senator, looking distressed, removed his jacket and asked for a chair so he could sit down. The symptoms, Dr. Nallamothu said, suggest that Mr. Sanders might have had a small heart attack \u2014 defined as a blockage that results in some damage to the heart muscle \u2014 or almost had a small heart attack. But he does not seem to have had a major one. With a smaller heart attack, a blood vessel is mostly blocked but a trickle of blood can still get through. If the person is sitting still, that can be enough blood to relieve symptoms. But if the person is standing and moving around \u2014 as Mr. Sanders was originally\u2014 the paucity of blood can cause chest pain and discomfort. In her statement, Ms. Sanders, who traveled on Wednesday to Las Vegas and is now with Mr. Sanders as he recovers, said her husband was in a buoyant mood, that doctors were \u201cpleased\u201d with Mr. Sanders\u2019s progress and that he had not needed any additional procedures. Former Senator Harry Reid of Nevada visited Mr. Sanders on Thursday at Desert Springs Hospital Medical Center. In a brief phone interview, Mr. Reid said Mr. Sanders \u201clooked really good.\u201d He said Mr. Sanders had been sitting in a big chair but \u201cjumped right up\u201d when he arrived and that the two spoke for about a half-hour, on topics including health care and his grandson, who works for Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign as a videographer. With Mr. Sanders were his wife; Faiz Shakir, his campaign manager; and Ari Rabin-Havt, a deputy campaign manager, he said. \u201cBernie is not a backslapping joke teller; he\u2019s a very serious man always,\u201d Mr. Reid said. \u201cHe feels good, he smiled.\u201d Internally, the campaign is trying to keep its staff motivated. Two advisers, Nina Turner and Jeff Weaver, led an all-staff conference call on Thursday, a campaign aide said, that appeared aimed at energizing the staff. \u201cWe are not taking our foot off the gas,\u201d Ms. Turner said. Still, the incident is likely to intensify the focus on Mr. Sanders\u2019s age, but also on age generally in the Democratic race, where the three top candidates \u2014 Mr. Sanders, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Elizabeth Warren \u2014 are all in their 70s. But if allies are projecting optimism about his ability to return to the race in full form, the medical episode has cast a shadow over his candidacy just as he was trying to reinvigorate his campaign and prepare for the next debate on Oct. 15. In recent weeks, he has tried to improve his standing in the race by overtly stressing his electability \u2014 an attempt to draw a contrast to Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren, who has continued to surge. On Tuesday, the Sanders campaign trumpeted its $25.3 million third-quarter fund-raising haul as it looked to put its summer woes behind it. Mr. Sanders\u2019s heart trouble, however, could complicate his argument that he is the best positioned to defeat President Trump in the general election. On Wednesday, his campaign said he was postponing a highly-touted $1.3 million television ad buy in Iowa. In an update on Thursday, the campaign said that it would begin airing the ad on Tuesday, and that it would run for two weeks as it had planned. The Sanders campaign\u2019s reluctance to provide much information about his health has also not helped to quell concern. Rebecca Katz, a progressive strategist who is not aligned with any candidate this cycle, said the Sanders campaign should be in \u201crapid response mode and giving out as many answers about Sanders\u2019s health as possible before more questions pile up.\u201d \u201cIf everything is fine,\u201d she said, \u201cThe campaign should be operating as normal.\u201d Since Wednesday, campaign aides have been trying to put the episode in a positive light, with some tweeting and retweeting well-wishes and encouragement. Surrogates and supporters have also expressed their solidarity. Some supporters have leveraged the episode into a rallying cry for fund-raising. Mr. Sanders himself sent out a tweet on Wednesday thanking his well-wishers and using the opportunity to plug \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d The tweet prompted some allies to praise him for being so devoted to his message. The campaign said several surrogates would visit Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina this weekend.",

            "content": "  Bernie Sanders acknowledged on Wednesday that he knew he had suffered a heart attack three days before his campaign released that information, but he defended the decision to keep those details private. Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign had been inundated with questions from the news media last week as he recovered at a hospital in Las Vegas, and speculation about whether he had had a heart attack spread on social media and among voters. Campaign officials waited until Mr. Sanders was released from the hospital on Friday, smiling and waving to news reporters, before disclosing that he had. In an interview with NBC News, Mr. Sanders said a doctor at an urgent care facility in Las Vegas, where he went last Tuesday night after experiencing chest pain, had informed him that he was having a \u201cheart event.\u201d The interviewer then asked if the doctor had said he was having a heart attack, to which Mr. Sanders said, \u201cYeah.\u201d His campaign did not announce that until Friday, saying only that doctors had inserted two stents to open a blocked artery \u2014 a fairly common procedure. A heart attack, known medically as a myocardial infarction, means that there was at least some damage to the heart muscle. Mr. Sanders, 78, rejected the idea that his campaign had showed a lack of transparency in not disclosing the information more quickly. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t accept that. I think that\u2019s a media thing,\u201d he told NBC, adding that his campaign had been trying \u201cto understand what in fact is going on.\u201d \u201cI think we did it appropriately and did it as quickly as we could,\u201d he said. \u201cNo apologies.\u201d His wife, Jane Sanders, said in an interview with The New York Times that she had received the heart attack news on Thursday, and that it was her decision to wait to release that information until her husband was discharged the next day. Mr. Sanders and his family were dealing with another crisis at the same time: the cancer diagnosis of his daughter-in-law, Rain\u00e8 Riggs. Ms. Riggs \u2014 who was married to Mr. Sanders\u2019s son Levi Sanders \u2014 died this weekend at age 46. \u201cI heard it on Thursday,\u201d Ms. Sanders said, referring to her husband\u2019s heart attack. \u201cBut frankly, I wasn\u2019t thinking about the campaign.\u201d Asked in the NBC interview what voters should think with regard to the future of his campaign, Mr. Sanders said: \u201cPeople should think that I had a procedure which hundreds of thousands of people a year have. People should think that according to the doctors, I\u2019m on the way to a full recovery.\u201d",

            "content": " Senator Bernie Sanders had a heart attack this week, his presidential campaign said on Friday as he left a Las Vegas hospital, following three days of near silence from the candidate and his advisers about his health. Mr. Sanders, 78, had entered the hospital on Tuesday night after experiencing chest pain at a campaign event, and doctors had inserted two stents in a blocked artery, a relatively common procedure. But the campaign did not confirm that Mr. Sanders had had a heart attack until Friday, inviting questions about his condition, and his campaign\u2019s transparency, as he remained off the campaign trail this week. Television cameras filmed Mr. Sanders as he left the hospital Friday, waving to onlookers and pumping a fist, then driving off in a sport utility vehicle. He will remain in Las Vegas on Friday night and return to his home in Burlington, Vt., on Saturday, campaign officials said. \u201cAfter two and a half days in the hospital, I feel great, and after taking a short time off, I look forward to getting back to work,\u201d Mr. Sanders said in a statement. While much of the conversation in the Democratic race has centered on issues like health care and student debt, Mr. Sanders\u2019s heart attack is likely to heighten scrutiny on age in a primary where the top candidates are all in their 70s. In addition to Mr. Sanders, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is 76 and Senator Elizabeth Warren is 70. President Trump is 73. But if Mr. Sanders has, until this week, largely avoided questions about his health \u2014 he has projected an image of fitness as a candidate and has maintained a blistering schedule on the campaign trail \u2014 the spotlight is now squarely on him. The ages of the current leaders notwithstanding, many Democratic voters have expressed discomfort with nominating a septuagenarian candidate, a notion that some political strategists say Mr. Sanders\u2019s heart attack is unlikely to dispel. \u201cRunning for president is a physical and emotional trial, and the presidency itself is even more demanding,\u201d said David Axelrod, a former top adviser to President Barack Obama. \u201cWhile we all wish Senator Sanders well, this has to be a big flashing light for him. And given his age, it may be for some voters, as well.\u201d Mr. Sanders began experiencing chest discomfort on Tuesday evening during a grass-roots fund-raiser he was hosting at a Las Vegas restaurant. As he began taking questions from the audience, he asked a campaign aide for a chair. He did not stay much longer at the event, and became visibly uncomfortable in a car afterward, according to two campaign officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive topic. At that point, Mr. Sanders was taken to an urgent care facility, where doctors determined that he should be transferred to a hospital. He was then taken by ambulance to Desert Springs Hospital Medical Center. At the hospital, he was taken immediately to the cardiac catheterization laboratory, where doctors inserted two stents into a blocked artery. By Wednesday, he was talking to his campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, about the campaign. By Thursday, he was walking laps around the hospital hallway, the officials said. His doctors in Las Vegas, Arturo E. Marchand Jr. and Arjun Gururaj, said in a statement that Mr. Sanders\u2019s \u201chospital course was uneventful with good expected progress.\u201d He spent three nights at the hospital and canceled his events and appearances for the week. The campaign released little information during the week about the extent of Mr. Sanders\u2019s heart trouble, fueling speculation about his health. But on Thursday the campaign said he would participate in the next Democratic debate, to be held near Columbus, Ohio, on Oct. 15. A heart attack means that a portion of the heart muscle died, starved of blood when a vessel was blocked, Dr. Gilbert Tang, a heart surgeon at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, said. \u201cThe first question is, how serious was the heart attack? What muscle was damaged and how will that affect the heart\u2019s function?\u201d Dr. Tang said. \u201cIf it was a significant portion of the heart, will that affect the heart\u2019s ability to pump?\u201d If only a small portion of heart muscle was damaged, he added, Mr. Sanders should make a full recovery \u2014 even at 78. These days recovery does not depend on age so much as other medical issues, like lung problems, he said. That does not mean that Mr. Sanders can simply continue as if nothing happened, though. Doctors usually recommend a cardiac rehabilitation program, which is essentially an exercise program in which patients are closely monitored. Such a program, Dr. Tang said, \u201cconditions the heart to work harder.\u201d Mr. Sanders would normally also take a cocktail of drugs to reduce his risk of another heart attack, including powerful anti-clotting medications that require close monitoring for a month, Dr. Tang said. In the 2016 presidential campaign, Mr. Sanders\u2019s doctor said that the senator was \u201cin overall very good health.\u201d His ailments included gout; a mild elevation of cholesterol; an inflammation of out-pouches in the bowel known as diverticulitis; and hormone replacement therapy for an underactive thyroid gland. He had no reported history of heart disease. Among the other candidates, Mr. Biden underwent emergency surgery in 1988 for a near-fatal ruptured berry aneurysm of an artery in his brain. He also underwent surgery to remove a second berry aneurysm. In 2008, Mr. Biden\u2019s doctor said that he had recovered fully. Mr. Trump has not had a medical emergency while running for or serving in office, though he has not released as much medical information to the public as other recent presidents have. This year, the White House physician pronounced Mr. Trump in \u201cvery good health,\u201d although the president had gained weight and is now officially obese. Other presidents and presidential candidates have had heart trouble, though not all of it was known to the public at the time. Experts believe that President Warren G. Harding died of a heart attack that his doctor did not detect. Toward the end of President Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s third term and until his death in his fourth term, his White House doctor withheld the fact that he had serious heart failure. President Dwight D. Eisenhower suffered a heart attack near the end of his first term, and might have had a heart attack before he ran for president. In 1999, former Senator Bill Bradley damaged his presidential campaign by not disclosing that he had had a number of episodes of atrial fibrillation, a heart rhythm abnormality, before he experienced one while campaigning and had to be rushed to a hospital with reporters trailing him. Before his heart attack pulled him from the campaign trail, Mr. Sanders was polling in the top tier of the Democratic primary race with Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren, and his staff has been trying to project optimism about his candidacy. But the episode has cast a shadow over his campaign just as he was attempting to reinvigorate it after a summer slump that saw his standing in some polls slip. Hoping to reverse course, he had recently begun to focus more on his electability, arguing that he is the candidate best positioned to beat Mr. Trump in the general election. The Sanders campaign announced this week that it had raised $25.3 million in the third quarter, placing him ahead of Ms. Warren, his chief ideological rival, by a hair and at the top of the field in fund-raising. In a show of force, the campaign announced a $1.3 million ad buy in Iowa that it then postponed as it waited to assess the situation; the ad will now begin airing next Tuesday, and will run for two weeks as planned. Campaign officials said they would determine when he would return to the trail as he recovers at his home, and it was possible that his first public appearance would be at the debate. His demeanor then will likely be watched closely by both voters and the news media. Already, Mr. Sanders is working against a built-in bias. When asked about age, voters show a clear preference for younger presidential candidates, with an overwhelming majority saying they prefer candidates in their 40s through 60s, according to surveys. When asked about the ideal age for a president, just 3 percent said the 70s, according to polling released by Pew Research Center in May. Other polls have shown that Americans express more discomfort with a candidate in his or her 70s than one who is gay, Muslim or an independent. Bryce Smith, 27, the Democratic Party chair in Dallas County, Iowa, said Mr. Sanders\u2019s health scare could hurt his chances \u2014 particularly against Ms. Warren. \u201cI do see that as something that is going to deter people that were maybe on the fence,\u201d he said. \u201cIf anyone was teetering between Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, this probably showed them that Elizabeth Warren has the stamina and the health and is a little bit younger in age to see it through eight years.\u201d Jill Alper, a Democratic strategist in Michigan and a veteran of Bill Clinton\u2019s and John Kerry\u2019s presidential bids, said voters would be watching Mr. Sanders closely in the next debate. \u201cDoes his energy level change? Does he campaign differently?\u201d she said. \u201cIf he maintains a reasonable energy level, it may not change anything for him.\u201d On Friday evening, after Mr. Sanders was released from the hospital, he dropped off his bags at his hotel and went for a walk in a park with his wife, Jane Sanders. The two were seen holding hands.",

            "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 As Senator Bernie Sanders recuperates from the heart attack he suffered while campaigning last Tuesday in Las Vegas, he will inevitably face questions in the coming days as to whether he will continue his presidential campaign and, if so, at what pace. Let\u2019s start with some facts straightaway. A heart attack does not disqualify anyone from running for and holding public office. Modern medicine enabled Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower and Lyndon B. Johnson and Vice President Dick Cheney to continue in their roles after having suffered heart attacks, as others serving in Congress or state governments have done. (It is important to note that the popular but nonspecific term \u201cheart attack\u201d describes an array of heart problems; one is myocardial infarction, or the death of heart muscle cells, which is what Mr. Sanders had.) By every indication, Mr. Sanders plans to continue his campaign for the presidency, and even told staff members on a telephone call Monday that he feels more \u201cmore strongly about the need for a political revolution today than I did when I began this campaign.\u201d [The latest data and analysis to keep track of who\u2019s leading the race to be the Democratic nominee.] Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., one of the race\u2019s leading candidates, also once faced questions about his ability to serve in public office because of a serious medical problem. In 1988, as a 45-year-old senator from Delaware, he experienced a near fatal rupture of an aneurysm in an artery in his brain. Shortly after his emergency surgery for the aneurysm, he had a second one removed before it could burst. Because new cerebral aneurysms can develop years later in a tiny percentage of individuals, some experts suggested that Mr. Biden be examined for any new aneurysms when Barack Obama selected him as his running mate. At the time, Mr. Biden\u2019s doctor said that he did not need further testing because he had recovered fully and done well for 20 years. Mr. Sanders is certainly not the first candidate whose presidential campaign was disrupted by a medical emergency. In 1999, former Senator Bill Bradley made an unexpected visit to a hospital in the San Francisco Bay Area for atrial fibrillation, a heart rhythm abnormality, which he did not disclose until after the incident. After canceling a few events, Mr. Bradley, now 76, resumed his campaign, but he eventually dropped out of the race after losing the New Hampshire primary. A poll of New Hampshire voters revealed concern about how he had handled the disclosure of his health issue. Still, Mr. Sanders\u2019s case is unusual in many respects: He is a leading candidate recovering from a heart attack at age 78 who must compete in an intensely competitive primary while also holding down a demanding job as senator. Indeed, Mr. Sanders\u2019s disruption comes amid increased pressure to bolster voter support with strong challenges from Mr. Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren, and it is unclear at what pace Mr. Sanders will carry on his campaign. \u201cBernie will be scrutinized very carefully in the next month or two for his ability to come back and campaign as vigorously as he has done in the 2016 and current presidential campaigns,\u201d said Ed Rollins, a former adviser to President Ronald Reagan. \u201cHe\u2019ll be looked at a little differently\u201d for things like being tired at the end of the day or stumbling in his delivery onstage, Mr. Rollins added. \u201cI have never known a politician or big moneyed guy or anyone who has had a first heart attack\u201d not consider his mortality, Mr. Rollins added. Also, Mr. Sanders \u201csurely will think about a running mate.\u201d Based on the health information he and his doctor provided when he ran in 2016, it would not have been possible to predict the Vermont senator\u2019s heart attack last week. At that time, his doctor said that Mr. Sanders was \u201cin overall very good health\u201d and that his ailments included gout, a mild elevation of cholesterol, diverticulitis and an underactive thyroid gland for which he took daily hormone therapy. Tests showed that Mr. Sanders\u2019s thyroid function and electrocardiogram tests were normal and that he had no reported history of heart disease. It is not known whether Mr. Sanders has had a full medical checkup since then. Over the long term, however, \u201colder patients are at higher risk of recurrent cardiac events after a heart attack,\u201d said Dr. Christopher P. Cannon, a cardiologist at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston. \u201cBut Mr. Sanders appears to have few cardiac risk factors like high blood pressure and diabetes.\u201d He pointed to data from a series of his team\u2019s published studies that showed a one-in-five chance within five years after a first heart attack that a second one, or even stroke or death, might occur. But such population-based statistics provide general odds and cannot necessarily be applied to an individual. \u201cVery few illnesses would preclude someone from holding high office,\u201d said Dr. Jonathan S. Reiner, a cardiologist at George Washington University Hospital in Washington, who treated Mr. Cheney for serious heart disease for many years before, during and after his two terms in office. \u201cBut the public has a right to know the salient details because the ailment or treatment can affect how the candidate performs in office.\u201d Although there are legal protections to keep health information confidential, most candidates seeking the presidency in recent years have responded to the public demand to know and have waived that privilege. \u201cThe public should have sufficient facts to understand the magnitude of the event and the near- and long-term prognosis for the candidate,\u201d Dr. Reiner said. \u201cMr. Sanders\u2019s campaign has released too few details to understand the medical impact of the heart attack on his health.\u201d Not all heart attacks, for example, are of the same dimension. Like Mr. Sanders, three other presidential candidates are also septuagenarians. Mr. Biden will be 77 next month and Ms. Warren is 70. All three have said they will release their medical records before the Iowa caucuses that begin in February, although Mr. Sanders\u2019s incident last week may push his top rivals to disclose their records sooner. Then there is President Trump, who is 73. He has not said whether he would release any health information before or after his third presidential medical checkup, which is expected in early 2020. While presidents are not required to have medical checkups or release findings if they have one, Mr. Trump released a detailed summary after his first presidential exam and a less detailed one after his second, earlier this year.",

            "content": " Senator Bernie Sanders raised $25.3 million in the past three months, his campaign said on Tuesday, a total that continues to demonstrate his strength with small donors as he fights to maintain support in key early-voting states. The financial haul, among the first that a candidate has announced for the third quarter, will place Mr. Sanders in the top tier of the field for fund-raising. It is also a much-needed boost for his campaign, as it looks to move past a summer slump that coincided with staff shake-ups in New Hampshire and Iowa and a slip in some polls in early-voting states. And it will perhaps help quell the narrative that his campaign is in decline. Mr. Sanders received 1.4 million donations in the third quarter, his campaign said. His third-quarter dollar total exceeds the $18 million he raised in the second quarter, which was roughly the same amount he collected during the first six weeks of his campaign at the beginning of the year. His campaign did not say how much cash it had on hand. Mr. Sanders announced his total for the quarter just minutes after Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., said he had raised $19.1 million in the same period. The fund-raising announcement comes as Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign begins a crucial phase of his presidential bid. He and his advisers had tried for months to portray the race as a battle between Mr. Sanders and Joseph R. Biden Jr., but the surge of Ms. Warren, his chief ideological rival, has scrambled that strategy. The top tier of candidates in the field has narrowed faster than his advisers expected, complicating matters: Rather than competing for the nomination with a half dozen candidates, he is essentially battling just two right now \u2014 Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren. Seeking to alter the course of the race, Mr. Sanders has shifted his message in recent weeks to focus more on electability. During a recent tour of eastern Iowa and campaign stops elsewhere, he has tried to make the case to voters that of all the Democratic hopefuls, he is the candidate most likely to prevail against President Trump. He has also introduced a series of audacious policy proposals, including establishing a national rent control standard, eliminating existing medical debt and instituting a wealth tax that goes farther than Ms. Warren\u2019s plan. Yet perhaps more than ever, Mr. Sanders is betting on the grass-roots appeal that propelled his 2016 campaign, a factor that his campaign says polls often fail to capture. Rather than relying on high-dollar fund-raisers \u2014 events he categorically rejects \u2014 he instead hopes to energize enthusiastic supporters who can donate to him again and again. In a show of force last month, his campaign said it had logged contributions from more than one million individual donors. His campaign said the average donation for the quarter was $18.07. His strategy means he does not have to worry about donors maxing out; his campaign said more than 99.9 percent can give again. But it also poses challenges: Though he has a loyal army of supporters and volunteers, many of them do not donate large amounts of money, meaning he must appeal to a huge pool of donors in order to keep pace with rivals like Mr. Buttigieg, who is willing to collect large sums of money on the traditional big donor fund-raising circuit.",

            "content": "  It was another busy week in Washington and on the campaign trail. Here is our quick rundown of what happened in the 2020 race. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont had a heart attack this week, and doctors inserted two stents to open a blocked artery. Mr. Sanders, 78, was taken to a Las Vegas hospital on Wednesday after he experienced \u201csome chest discomfort\u201d at an event Tuesday night. His wife, Jane Sanders, later said that he was resting comfortably and that he would participate in the next Democratic debate, on Oct. 15. The news that he\u2019d had a heart attack was not revealed until he was discharged from the hospital on Friday. The end of the third fiscal quarter was Monday, and candidates have started announcing their fund-raising totals for July, August and September. We\u2019re tracking the numbers here. Our colleague Reid J. Epstein wrote about the last-minute email scramble for donations. (Meet our goal! Save the kittens!) Here\u2019s where some of the candidates ended up: President Trump\u2019s re-election campaign and the Republican National Committee raised a combined $125 million in the third quarter. Of course, the numbers aren\u2019t directly comparable to the Democratic hauls, since each donor can give hundreds of thousands of dollars to the R.N.C., but only $5,600 to an individual candidate. On Wednesday, Mr. Biden delivered his most forceful response yet to Mr. Trump\u2019s requests that foreign countries investigate unsubstantiated allegations about him and his son Hunter. He accused the Trump team of trying to use \u201clies, smears, distortions and name calling\u201d to knock him out of the presidential race. Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign also contacted television anchors and networks on Sunday to \u201cdemand\u201d that Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, be kept off the air for promoting \u201cfalse, debunked conspiracy theories.\u201d Ms. Harris, for her part, called (in a tweet and more formally in a letter) on Twitter to suspend Mr. Trump\u2019s account for what she said was harassment of the whistle-blower, a violation of the platform\u2019s terms of service. It\u2019s official: The next Democratic debate will feature a dozen candidates onstage at once. As we\u2019ve mentioned before, the Oct. 15 debate in Ohio will feature the 10 candidates who appeared at last month\u2019s event as well as Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii and Tom Steyer, the former hedge fund investor. In the world of not-so-surprising news, we learned on Tuesday that Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, is not a fan of Ms. Warren\u2019s plan to \u201cbreak up big tech.\u201d \u201cIf she gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg told Facebook employees, according to recordings leaked to The Verge. Suffice it to say, there were more remarks where those came from, and Ms. Warren offered some of her own: Facebook, she said, had repeatedly fumbled its \u201cresponsibility to protect our democracy.\u201d Nine of the 2020 candidates appeared at a gun policy forum in Las Vegas on Wednesday, two years and one day after a gunman massacred 58 concertgoers there, and expressed their collective support for sweeping new gun restrictions. Gun control once splintered Democrats along regional and ideological lines, but the party is increasingly unified around an assault weapons ban, gun licensing and other measures. Before the event, both Mr. Biden (who participated) and Mr. Steyer (who wasn\u2019t invited) released gun control plans. On Monday, Mr. Sanders unveiled another proposal aimed at reducing income inequality: a corporate tax that would penalize the country\u2019s largest companies if they don\u2019t narrow the gap between what they pay their top executives and what they pay their workers. Two days later, Ms. Warren outlined a new tax on \u201cexcessive lobbying,\u201d which would apply to corporations and trade organizations that spend more than $500,000 a year lobbying the government. When \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d does an entire skit on a Democratic debate, all the time you\u2019ve spent trying to keep up with this clown-car primary can suddenly seem worth it. Enjoy the \u201ccorn pop\u201d story, Maya Rudolph\u2019s portrayal of Ms. Harris, and this very good tweet from Ms. Harris herself.",

            "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 Betsy DeVos, President-elect Donald J. Trump\u2019s choice to lead the Education Department, was sharply criticized by Democrats on Tuesday evening in what was shaping up to be a contentious confirmation hearing. \u25a0 Republicans countered Democrats with rich praise for Ms. DeVos. \u25a0 Representative Ryan Zinke, Republican of Montana, Mr. Trump\u2019s choice for secretary of the Interior, had an easier time of it in his hearing on Tuesday. \u25a0 The main target of Democratic ire is likely to be Mr. Trump\u2019s choice to head the Department of Health and Human Services, Representative Tom Price, Republican of Georgia. His hearing Wednesday morning will focus on his strong opposition to the Affordable Care Act. Ms. DeVos, a billionaire philanthropist, has attracted opposition from organizations supporting charter schools and from teachers\u2019 unions. Her opening statement said that the public education system in the United States needed to move away from \u201ca one-size-fits-all model of learning,\u201d and toward one that would support parents who chose to send their children to private or religious schools, or to home school. \u201cToo many parents are denied access to the full range of options,\u201d she said. \u201cChoices that many of us \u2014 here in this room \u2014 have exercised for our own children.\u201d \u201cWhy, in 2017, are we still questioning parents\u2019 ability to exercise educational choice for their children?\u201d she asked. Ms. DeVos recalled her own education in a Christian school in Western Michigan, and her mother\u2019s job as a public-school teacher. She described a visit she and her husband, an heir to the Amway fortune, made to a Christian school in her hometown, Grand Rapids, Mich., as a turning point in her career as an advocate for school choice. \u201cWe saw the struggles and sacrifices many of these families faced when trying to choose the best educational option for their children,\u201d she said. \u201cFor me, this was not just an issue of public policy but of national injustice.\u201d She added: \u201cHere\u2019s the sad reality. In the past 28 years, the need and demand for these other options have grown, unabated.\u201d Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the ranking Democrat on the committee, said she was \u201cextremely disappointed\u201d that Ms. DeVos\u2019s hearing was proceeding before she had completed an agreement with the independent Office of Government Ethics that outlined a plan to deal with potential conflicts of interest. Mr. Zinke portrayed himself as an eager steward of the nation\u2019s public lands, treading a fine line between the importance of preservation and utilization as he testified before a Senate panel as Mr. Trump\u2019s choice for interior secretary. Mr. Zinke professed his admiration not only for the naturalist John Muir, a champion of preservation, but also for Gifford Pinchot, the first chief of the United States Forest Service. Mr. Pinchot pushed for what he described as the planned use and renewal of natural resources. \u201cIt is also these lands that many communities, like the town I grew up in, rely on to harvest timber, mine and to provide our nation with energy,\u201d he said in prepared remarks. He said one of his priorities leading the Interior Department would be addressing an estimated $12.5-billion backlog of maintenance and repairs in the national parks system. Mr. Zinke broke with Mr. Trump on the issue of climate change Tuesday, disagreeing with the president-elect\u2019s assertion at one point that it is \u201ca hoax.\u201d Mr. Zinke, who once said that climate change was \u201cnot proven science,\u201d said the climate was changing and that humans were having an impact on it. \u201cI think the debate is what that influence is, what we can do about it,\u201d Mr. Zinke said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it\u2019s a hoax,\u201d he added. He expressed his support for the president-elect\u2019s desire for energy independence, though, and he described his approach to developing energy resources on public lands as \u201call of the above.\u201d Mr. Zinke also drew a clear line on whether the federal government should keep control of its land. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely against transfer and sale of public lands,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t be more clear.\u201d Perhaps this week\u2019s most contentious confirmation hearing will Wednesday, when a Senate panel will take a look at Mr. Price, Mr. Trump\u2019s selection for secretary of Health and Human Services. Just days after congressional Republicans voted to move forward with plans to repeal President Obama\u2019s health care law, senators will question Mr. Price, one of the law\u2019s top critics in Congress. Republicans hope he can be an aggressive force within the administration as they work to repeal and replace the health care law. Democrats, who cannot block the repeal effort, will most likely take the opportunity to highlight their view that repealing the law will leave millions without health insurance. Watch for Democrats to attack Mr. Price\u2019s support for overhauling the Medicare system, an idea that would move away from its open-ended commitment to pay medical costs toward a plan where beneficiaries receive a fixed amount.",

            "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 After contentious confirmation hearings, protests across the country and two rounds of voting, Betsy DeVos cleared the first hurdle in her path to becoming secretary of education on Tuesday with a party-line vote in the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions that advanced her nomination to the Senate floor. All 12 Republican senators on the committee voted for Ms. DeVos, a billionaire with a complex web of investments, including some in companies with connections to federal education policy. All 11 Democrats opposed her, calling her both dangerous and unqualified. The committee voted twice on Ms. DeVos\u2019s nomination after Democrats protested against a vote cast on behalf of Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, who was initially absent. Ms. DeVos\u2019s ultimate confirmation, while likely, is still not definite. Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, chairman of the committee, was visibly frustrated \u2014 by Democratic delaying tactics and arguments \u2014 as he defended Ms. DeVos and said she would be devoted not only to giving parents a choice about school options but also to protecting public schools. \u201cShe wants to reverse the trend of a national school board and stop telling teachers and school boards how to run their schools,\u201d Mr. Alexander said. \u201cOne would think the committee would be delighted with that. I respect my colleagues. I don\u2019t question their motives. I don\u2019t question their votes. But I believe their concerns are misplaced.\u201d But Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, expressed reservations about Ms. DeVos that sounded similar to those of Ms. DeVos\u2019s opponents. The senator said that while she would vote to advance Ms. DeVos out of committee, she would not commit to voting for her on the Senate floor. \u201cShe has not yet earned my full support,\u201d said Ms. Murkowski, who referred to conversations with Alaska teachers. \u201cBetsy DeVos must show all of us that she truly understands children of all America, of rural, of urban, who are not able to access an alternative choice in education.\u201d Democrats, teachers\u2019 unions and liberal protesters have been flooding senators with calls and emails protesting her nomination for myriad reasons. They have expressed concern about her family\u2019s contributions to groups that support so-called conversion therapy for gay people; her donations to Republicans and their causes, which she agreed have totaled about $200 million over the years; and her past statements that government \u201csucks\u201d and that public schools are a \u201cdead end.\u201d Opponents have focused on the poor performance of charter schools in Detroit, which she has bankrolled even as she resisted legislation that would have blocked chronically failing charter schools from expanding. Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the ranking Democrat on the committee, insisted she needed more time to question Ms. DeVos about possible conflicts of interests and about her dedication to ensuring the protection of public schools, which she eschewed for her own children. \u201cI have not been persuaded that Betsy DeVos will put students first if she were confirmed, and I have not been persuaded that she has the experience, skills, understanding, or vision to lead this critical department at a time when it is more important than ever,\u201d Ms. Murray said. \u201cFrom everything we heard, everything we know, and all of the questions that still remain, it is clear to me that Betsy DeVos is the wrong choice to lead our nation\u2019s Department of Education.\u201d",

            "content": " At Hiawatha Academies\u2019 elementary school in the Morris Park neighborhood of Minneapolis, signs welcome immigrants in multiple languages. Over 75 percent of students there are learning English as a second language, and most are the children of Hispanic immigrants. Hiawatha runs some of Minnesota\u2019s best public schools for serving such students; the Morris Park school, where math and literacy proficiency rates for students learning English are more than double the statewide averages for that group, is one of its flagships. Hiawatha schools should be easy for the left to love. They\u2019re full of progressive educators helping children of color from low-income families succeed. And yet, they\u2019re charter schools. Like most charters, Hiawatha schools get public funding, but their daily operations are run by a nonprofit organization and their teachers are not unionized. Progressives have long been open to research suggesting that well-regulated charter schools can extend educational opportunities to historically underserved children. But many also worry that charters foster segregation, siphon funding from traditional public schools and cater to policymakers\u2019 obsession with standardized tests. And the more President Trump and his secretary of education, Betsy DeVos, embrace charters, the more suspect they seem to people on the left. Ms. DeVos, who has been widely lampooned for her lack of expertise, can\u2019t stop talking about how much she loves charters. She is so unpopular that she has set off a \u201cpolitical backlash\u201d against these schools, two charter supporters wrote in USA Today. One survey of views on charter schools found that Democrats\u2019 support dropped when they heard that President Trump supported them. In other words, the president and his education secretary are so disliked by liberals that some will automatically reject whatever they endorse. This puts Hiawatha in an awkward position. How should a charter network run by progressives committed to combating racism navigate the Trump administration\u2019s vocal support of charters? How should it respond to criticism from progressives who accuse it of undermining public education? Charter schools are politically homeless. Hiawatha was founded in 2007 by Jon Bacal, an education entrepreneur in Minnesota. Ambar Hanson, a Hiawatha administrator and parent, said the network was \u201cfounded out of frustration at the huge gaps in education for students of color.\u201d At Hiawatha, these are called opportunity gaps instead of achievement gaps. \u201cTalking about the achievement gap was often heard by our community members as putting it on them,\u201d Ms. Hanson said. \u201c\u2018Opportunity gap\u2019 is changing the rhetoric to put the responsibility of closing that gap on schools, where it belongs.\u201d The executive director of the network, Eli Kramer, said, \u201cWe\u2019re trying to elevate the importance of identity, race consciousness, pride in self as really core to the mission.\u201d A walk through Hiawatha Collegiate High School, also in Minneapolis, confirms this. Its walls are papered with posters spotlighting the United Nations\u2019 Universal Declaration of Human Rights. \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d stickers are everywhere. Hiawatha\u2019s project goes beyond posters. More than 95 percent of Minnesota\u2019s teachers are white, and just 1 percent are Hispanic. So the network recruits for diversity. Over a quarter of Hiawatha teachers are people of color. But the school\u2019s commitment to social justice is most visible when it comes to its immigrant families. Early in the Trump administration, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents began detaining undocumented immigrants near schools. Many Hiawatha students have family members without papers, so the network declared its campuses to be safe havens for undocumented people. Several staff members have volunteered to serve as legal guardians in case students\u2019 parents are deported. When President Trump allowed the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program to expire, students staged a walkout in protest. School leaders say teachers are intentional about stopping instruction for conversations when students bring up politics. Indeed, on the board in one fourth-grade classroom recently was the question \u201cWhat does Trump mean by \u2018Make America Great Again\u2019?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s pretty devastating to have to focus on these kinds of things in addition to academics and instruction,\u201d Ms. Hanson said. And now the teachers are being forced to respond to criticism from people who by most measures should be their allies. Robert Panning-Miller, the former president of the Minneapolis Federation of Teachers, has called Hiawatha schools emblematic of a \u201ccorporate reform movement\u201d that values \u201ccompliance and test scores over critical thinking\u201d and criticized them as being part of an \u201capartheid education\u201d movement, because their students are almost exclusively children of color. It\u2019s true that nine out of 10 Hiawatha students are Hispanic. But if Hiawatha schools enroll a high number of minority students and English learners, that\u2019s because they serve them well. During the Obama administration, tensions over charter schools among progressives were manageable. National charter school enrollment grew with support from President Barack Obama and his secretaries of education, Arne Duncan and John King. But the administration also provided more resources and flexibility for the education system as a whole. The Every Student Succeeds Act, which replaced No Child Left Behind as the country\u2019s primary K-12 education law in 2015, continued these trends. It reduced federal oversight of states\u2019 academic standards, as well as oversight of state programs for historically underserved students. This blend of policies helped keep progressive infighting on issues like standardized tests and federal accountability simmering instead of boiling. Left-wing education reform critics increasingly focused their attention on charter schools instead. The 2016 election sharpened that dynamic. In 2017, while Ms. DeVos was pushing her school choice agenda, an Education Next poll found that Democratic support for charter schools dropped by 11 percentage points. Progressive critics are taking advantage of the moment to tie charter-friendly Democrats to her toxic public image. On the day after President Trump\u2019s inauguration, Valerie Strauss, a Washington Post education writer, accused Democratic reformers like Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, the former Newark mayor, of \u201cadvancing corporate education reform\u201d through their support of school choice. This puts the country\u2019s many thousands of charter-school teachers in an odd place. Most come to this work to provide underserved children with a better shot at educational success, but now they\u2019re increasingly branded as corporate stooges selling out public education by critics who challenge charter schools\u2019 right to exist. These teachers shouldn\u2019t have to answer for Ms. DeVos\u2019s incompetence or wonder if there\u2019s room for them in the future of progressive education politics. Progressives can ill afford this kind of sniping. The last thing the left needs right now is a war between teachers unions and liberal charter supporters. \u201cI wish that people knew that the thing that\u2019s most important to us is that students are achieving at high academic levels and they\u2019re also empowered individuals,\u201d said Natalie Heath, who teaches English language development at Hiawatha. That\u2019s all that should matter. But when it comes to education politics in 2018, it seems to be the last thing anyone wants to talk about.",

            "content": " Betsy DeVos, the education secretary, deserved the hammering she received for her widely reviled comments characterizing historically black colleges and universities (H.B.C.U.s) as early examples of \u201cschool choice.\u201d But when it comes to the fate of H.B.C.U.s under the Trump administration, her apparent misunderstanding of their history is a distraction. The fate of these institutions in the coming years will hinge not on her words, but on her decisions about their funding. In February, after only a few days on the job, Ms. DeVos made headlines for visiting Howard University, a historically black college founded in 1867. Then, after a meeting with H.B.C.U. leaders Monday, she released a statement calling H.B.C.U.s the \u201creal pioneers when it comes to school choice.\u201d That description was widely criticized as a dishonest attempt to distance these institutions from the segregated past that necessitated them and to awkwardly reposition them as talking points for the school choice movement. But her misguided remarks have diverted attention away from something more urgent: She now oversees the federal agency that is responsible for roughly three-fourths of the annual federal revenue to H.B.C.U.s. In ways that are much more consequential than any statement she could make, this power will allow her to determine how the schools fare under the Trump administration. Tuesday, President Trump issued an executive order moving the White House Initiative on HBCUs (WHI-HBCUs) from the Department of Education to the Office of the White House. Some H.B.C.U. advocates supported this move because of their impression that it would strengthen the administrative authority of the initiative and elevate the stature of its executive director. However, moving the WHI-HBCUs from the Department of Education to the White House distances the initiative from the source of essential funding for H.B.C.U.s. That\u2019s because the Education Department is responsible for the distribution of approximately $700 million annually in grants, contracts and appropriations to those schools. But when it comes to annual revenue to H.B.C.U.s, the Office of the President is directly responsible for zero dollars. This arrangement leaves Ms. DeVos with significant power. H.B.C.U. advocates and defenders like me should focus less on dissecting her talking points and misstatements and more on seeking answers to specific questions about her attitudes toward the funding of historically black colleges in the present day. First, what are Ms. DeVos\u2019s plans related to Title III, the federal grant program within the Department of Education designed to build the capacity of H.B.C.U.s? President Obama\u2019s budget for the 2017 fiscal year, which never passed, sought to maintain and strengthen these opportunities for H.B.C.U.s to build their capacity. It included a proposal for $85 million in mandatory funding to the schools, as well as $244.7 million in discretionary Title III funding. Will Ms. DeVos maintain or increase these levels of funding? Second, will Ms. DeVos create new grant programs and contracting opportunities for H.B.C.U.s? President Obama proposed $30 million for a program designed to increase the number of low-income students completing degree programs. Will she work with Congress to include similar programs in the federal budget? Third, what are Ms. DeVos\u2019s views on college affordability? In his budget proposal to Congress last year, President Obama requested $60.8 billion in mandatory funding over the next decade to help states make two years of community college free, as well as to offer grants to provide free or reduced tuition to students at H.B.C.U.s and minority-serving institutions in their first two years. Will Ms. DeVos be supportive of similar measures? Finally, will Ms. DeVos protect and expand the Pell Grant program? Approximately 73 percent of all H.B.C.U. students receive Pell Grants to fund their education. Before leaving office, President Obama and his education secretary, John King, issued proposals to ensure that Pell Grants were fully funded. Mr. Obama\u2019s 2017 fiscal-year budget included mandatory protections of Pell Grants. How will Ms. DeVos protect this essential source of funding? The answers to these questions will have enormous bearing on the futures of colleges and universities that serve students who have been historically disenfranchised. As budget priorities are set for these vulnerable institutions, Ms. DeVos has the potential to be an important influencer of the president and negotiator with Congress. It will be her actions in this area \u2014 not her campus visits, meetings or comments \u2014 that will determine whether she is ultimately a friend or foe to H.B.C.U.s.",

            "content": " Education Secretary Betsy DeVos on Friday officially repealed an Obama-era regulation that sought to crack down on for-profit colleges and universities that produced graduates with no meaningful job prospects and mountains of student debt they could not hope to repay. The so-called gainful employment rule was issued by the Obama administration in 2014, right before huge for-profit chains collapsed, leaving students stranded with debt and worthless degrees. Under the new standards, career and certificate programs, many of which operate in the for-profit sector, would have to prove their graduates could find gainful employment to maintain access to federal financial aid. It also would have required schools to disclose in advertisements a comparison of the student debt load of their graduates and their career earnings. In her first two years in office, Ms. DeVos has delayed critical parts of the rule, and last year, she sought to repeal it entirely, siding with for-profit industry leaders and congressional conservatives who have contended that the Obama administration unfairly targeted for-profit schools. Education Department officials have argued that transparency, not regulation, is the best way to hold all schools \u2014 public nonprofits, community colleges and for-profits \u2014 accountable for their results. Instead of any accountability measures, it promised to expand an existing database, called the College Scorecard, to provide information on student debt and earnings prospects. The database, which provides information, including loan debt information, for 2,100 certificate granting programs, was unveiled last month. On Friday, Ms. DeVos said that the scorecard was \u201conly the beginning.\u201d \u201cThese important reforms are a more complete and effective way to hold all types of higher education institutions accountable and make sure that students have a full suite of data when making a decision about their education,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cThis administration will continue to put students first and make sure they not only have a multitude of pathways to success post-high school but also the information they need to make the best choices for themselves.\u201d But in rescinding the rule, the department is eradicating the most fearsome accountability measure \u2014 the loss of federal aid \u2014 for schools that promise to furnish students with specific career skills but fail to prepare them for the job market, leaving taxpayers on the hook to pay back their loans. Congressional Democrats and student advocates said rescinding the rule would leave the scandal-scarred for-profit college industry unchecked. The repeal will take effect July 2020. The department estimated that repealing the rule would cost $6.2 billion over 10 years, which includes funding grants and loans to students attending schools that would have been cut off from federal funding under the Obama rule. \u201cRepealing \u2014 rather than revising or replacing \u2014 the gainful employment rule will prop up low-quality for-profit colleges at the expense of students and taxpayers,\u201d said Representative Robert C. Scott of Virginia, the chairman of the House education panel. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement underscores the need for Congress to pass a comprehensive reauthorization of the Higher Education Act that protects students and taxpayers from low quality for-profit schools.\u201d Bob Shireman, a senior fellow at the Century Foundation and an architect of the rule when he was in the Obama administration, called the repeal \u201cdisturbing and shortsighted.\u201d \u201cThey are opening the door to operators whose singular focus on gobbling up federal grants and loans for their investors will steer the business toward manipulative recruiting and poor quality training,\u201d he said. The Obama administration began drafting the regulations when the for-profit college sector was booming, with large chains enrolling 500,000 students at a time. But it was seen as a crucial safeguard against predatory colleges after the collapse of ITT Tech and Corinthian Colleges beginning in 2015. The Obama administration also tried to channel loan relief to graduates who were defrauded by their colleges. Ms. DeVos has moved to overhaul that \u201cborrower-defense\u201d rule as well, hoping to give some students only partial relief. That process has been tied up in court proceedings, leaving more than 150,000 student claims in limbo. One part of the gainful employment rule that had already been put into place has identified hundreds of failing programs, many of which went on to close after they were measured against the new standards. In the Education Department\u2019s first assessment of debt-to-earnings ratios for college graduates, about 98 percent of programs that failed to meet standards for earning power were for-profits. An analysis included in the department\u2019s final rule also shows that for-profits continued to have a significantly higher failure rate. But the department argued in its final rule that the debt-to-earnings formula created by the Obama administration was \u201cfundamentally flawed\u201d and did not account for factors other than the quality of an education that could affect students\u2019 earning potential. The department also said that the rule did not properly account for other kinds of programs that have poor career outcomes and high debt, such as some liberal arts degrees. For-profit leaders have said that although the Obama rule was never fully enforced, its intent already shut down the worst-performing schools in their sector. Since 2010, when the Obama administration began deliberating the rules, more than 2,000 for-profit and career programs \u2014 nearly half \u2014 have closed, and the industry\u2019s student population has dropped by more than 1.6 million. \u201cThe U.S. Department of Education\u2019s final decision commits our nation\u2019s entire higher education system to full transparency,\u201d said Steve Gunderson, the president of Career Education Colleges and Universities, the for-profit trade group. \u201cInstead of picking and choosing winners and losers in higher education, the department will make available, in a student-friendly and transparent manner, key data points at a program level for all programs at all schools.\u201d",

            "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 Dream Center Education Holdings, a subsidiary of a Los Angeles-based megachurch, had no experience in higher education when it petitioned the federal Education Department to let it take over a troubled chain of for-profit trade schools. But the organization\u2019s chairman, Randall K. Barton, told the education secretary, Betsy DeVos, that the foundation wanted to \u201chelp people live better lives.\u201d The purchase was blessed despite Dream Center\u2019s lack of experience and questionable finances by an administration favorable to for-profit education. But barely a year later, the company tumbled into insolvency, dozens of its colleges closed abruptly and thousands of students were left with no degree after paying tens of thousands of dollars in tuition. Making matters worse, the college is accused of enrolling new students and taking their taxpayer-supported financial aid dollars even after some of its campuses had lost their accreditation, which rendered their credits worthless. Company emails, documents and recordings show that part of why Dream Center kept going is that it thought the Education Department, which under Ms. DeVos has rolled back regulations on for-profit education, would try to keep it from failing. Mr. Barton emailed other Dream Center executives that the department\u2019s head of higher education policy \u2014 Diane Auer Jones, a former executive and lobbyist for for-profit colleges \u2014 had pulled strings to help the company\u2019s schools in their effort to regain a seal of approval from an accreditor, despite their perilous positions. In another instance, Dream Center\u2019s chief operating officer told faculty at an endangered campus that Ms. Jones was changing departmental regulations to help the schools obtain accreditation retroactively. Although the Trump administration did eventually cut off federal aid to the chain of colleges and precipitate their collapse, Democrats say the department failed to respond to warning signs. Representative Robert C. Scott, a Virginia Democrat who is the chairman of the House Education Committee, unveiled a trove of documents, including internal communication between executives from Dream Center, in a letter to Ms. DeVos this month. He said the documents suggest that Ms. Jones misled Congress about her efforts to help shield Dream Center from its misdeeds. \u201cThe actions of Dream Center and the Department of Education\u2019s execution of its responsibility to protect students raise grave concerns,\u201d Mr. Scott wrote. Instead of requiring Dream Center to take action, \u201cthe department informed Dream Center executives that it would work to retroactively accredit the institutions during the periods they had lied to students \u2014 rewriting history to erase Dream Center\u2019s deceptive marketing practices,\u201d Mr. Scott wrote. The Education Department has maintained it did nothing wrong. \u201cThis story is based entirely on a wrongful premise,\u201d the department wrote in a statement. \u201cThe full and complete timeline shows Dream Center did not receive any unique benefits from policy decisions made by the department. We simply worked to try and get as many students into a new program as possible. While we did not achieve a perfect outcome, our actions helped thousands of students land on their feet.\u201d In a response letter to Mr. Scott on Monday, the department\u2019s acting general counsel, Reed D. Rubinstein, submitted documentation that he said contradicted the committee\u2019s \u201cunfair suggestions\u201d that the department tailored its policies to assist Dream Center and was not forthcoming with Congress. \u201cThe Department categorically rejects these allegations,\u201d he wrote. \u201cDream Center\u2019s management received no special treatment,\u201d he said. President Trump has moved to deregulate any number of industries, from mining and offshore oil exploration to chemicals and internet providers. But Ms. DeVos\u2019s efforts to get the government off the backs of for-profit colleges have come under particular scrutiny, in part because of the spectacular implosions of for-profit college chains only a few years ago, in part because people who once worked in the sector have led the DeVos deregulatory push. Dream Center\u2019s collapse was the first of the new deregulatory era. Yet Education Department officials insisted, repeatedly, that its demise had nothing to do with the administration\u2019s policies or efforts. Ms. Jones told Congress that she did not even know of Dream Center\u2019s accreditation problems at the time the company said she was working to get it out of its jam. She also told lawmakers the policy change extending retroactive accreditation had \u201cnothing to do with the Dream Center.\u201d Those assurances are now being questioned. \u201cThe documents further suggest that department officials were not forthcoming to Congress and the public about the information they had about Dream Center\u2019s status and practices,\u201d Mr. Scott wrote. He is requesting emails, text messages and interviews with several department officials, including Ms. Jones. The letter and documents \u201craise questions about whether the department took steps to allow Dream Center to mislead students,\u201d Mr. Scott said. [Read the documents.] From the start, the Education Department overlooked red flags when, in late 2017, Dream Center took control of more than 100 campuses with 50,000 students from a for-profit higher-education company, Education Management Corporation. Around that time, Dream Center\u2019s accreditor, the Higher Learning Commission, notified the organization that it was about to change two of its schools\u2019 accreditation status. Two Education Department officials, including the agency\u2019s director of accreditation, were copied on the letter. In January 2018, the accreditor published a notification on its website stating that the two Dream Center schools were not accredited by the Higher Learning Commission. It ordered Dream Center to tell students that their courses and degrees \u201cmay not be accepted in transfer to other colleges and universities or recognized by prospective employers.\u201d Yet for five months, Dream Center kept advertising, \u201cWe remain accredited.\u201d By July 2018, Dream Center was running out of cash and knew its accreditation problems could worsen its financial strain. Emails from that month obtained by the House Education Committee indicate that Dream Center officials believed that the Education Department was maneuvering to help it stave off catastrophe. In written responses to questions from Congress, the Education Department said Ms. Jones was first made aware that the two Dream Center institutions were not accredited on July 10, 2018. She was unaware of the public notice that the Higher Learning Commission had issued nearly six months earlier, according to the agency. She was notified a week later that the institutions were misrepresenting their accreditation status and ordered them the next day to stop, the department said. Ms. Jones was asked during a House Oversight Committee hearing this spring whether a policy she had issued later that month that allowed accreditations to be granted retroactively was aimed at helping Dream Center. \u201cAbsolutely not. It had nothing to do with the Dream Center,\u201d she answered. But in company emails, Dream Center executives indicated the Education Department tipped them off on July 3, 2018, that a new retroactive accreditation policy was coming, a week before Ms. Jones said she even knew Dream Center had a problem. \u201cWe just got off the phone with DOE,\u201d Mr. Barton wrote. \u201cIt appears HLC is in sync with retro\u201d accreditation. He said Ms. Jones \u2014 whom he directly cited by name \u2014 had worked with accreditors, and \u201cthey will all agree to one plan with department blessing.\u201d Mr. Barton did not respond to requests for comment on his emails. On July 11, Dream Center\u2019s chief operating officer told faculty in a meeting on an Illinois campus that the department would allow the schools\u2019 accreditor to grant retroactive accreditation. He said department officials \u201cchanged their regulation to open the door to letting it happen,\u201d according to a recording of the meeting obtained by the committee. He referred to a conversation with Ms. Jones the week prior where \u201cshe said everybody was going to be accommodating.\u201d Weeks later, on July 25, Ms. Jones finalized the plan allowing retroactive accreditation, which was a major win for Dream Center. While the schools were already slated for closure, retroactive accreditation would have shielded the company from legal action for making misleading statements about its accreditation status. Ms. Jones said she had begun to revise that guidance months earlier to allay longstanding concerns about the department\u2019s policy stemming from a dispute involving an accreditor of a nursing program. The retroactive policy would have also allowed students to more easily transfer their credits if they were earned at an accredited institution. In response to Mr. Scott\u2019s accusations, Ms. Jones said, in a written statement to The New York Times, \u201cThe retroactive accreditation policy \u2014 which had been under discussion long before I arrived at the department \u2014 decided not whether Dream Center would live or die, but whether or not students could transfer their credits for the hard work they had completed.\u201d In August, after it became public that the two schools would close, Dream Center\u2019s head of regulatory and government affairs wrote an email to other Dream Center officials reminding them that communication should be kept confidential because \u201cDiane is really working behind the scenes to help guide us and keep the accreditors aligned.\u201d Ms. Jones did not directly address the July 3 and July 11 communication from Dream Center officials, but acknowledged that she had worked with accreditors. She called the Dream Center accreditation issue a \u201cmessy and complex situation\u201d and said the accreditor had sent mixed messages about the status of Dream Center\u2019s schools. Ms. Jones had acknowledged to Congress that she had concerns about the organization\u2019s capacity to manage its closures, and was in regular communication with a group of accreditors to devise a plan to allow Dream Center students to complete their degrees, known as a \u201cteach-out,\u201d after their campuses closed. \u201cMy goal was to get as many of the more than 8,000 students to new institutions where they could complete their programs,\u201d she said. \u201cI stand firm in my decision to work collaboratively with accreditors to hold Dream Center accountable. That Dream Center executives characterize this as being about them is disingenuous but not surprising. They were trying to make it appear they had control of the mess they had made.\u201d A group of students, represented by the National Student Legal Defense Network, filed a lawsuit last year, saying Dream Center issued \u201cfalse and misleading\u201d statements about its accreditation status, which broke state laws and caused \u201csubstantial harm\u201d to more than 1,000 students. Mr. Scott also pointed to emails documenting the steps the Education Department took to help Dream Center get hold of some much-needed cash to prop up its failing campuses. In an October 2018 email, Dream Center officials were preparing to request funding from an escrow account managed by the department. The funds were intended to offset taxpayer liabilities if some of the chain\u2019s schools closed or failed. Dream Center wanted to use part of the money to pay for expenses associated with closing campuses and helping current students complete their degrees. The department had in August agreed to release up to $50 million; Dream Center wanted more. Dennis Cariello, a Dream Center lawyer, sent an email to company executives before a meeting with A. Wayne Johnson, who headed the department\u2019s office of financial aid. At the meeting, Mr. Cariello planned to deliver a \u201clist of the asks\u201d that amounted to $75 million. Mr. Cariello communicated that Mr. Johnson \u201casked that I review the draw requests \u2014 there are a few we can\u2019t have in there \u2014 bonuses and future rental payments were issues for him.\u201d Mr. Cariello declined to comment on the exchange. The department had released a total of $40 million from the escrow account to Dream Center by the end of last year, according to records it sent in response to questions from Congress. Education Department officials have maintained that they worked tirelessly to mitigate the fallout of the Dream Center collapse. The department restricted the schools\u2019 cash flow from federal student loans after Dream Center went into receivership in January, barely a month before it cut off federal student loan funds to Argosy University. That final move was considered the death knell for the company. But until then, Dream Center executives had reason to believe they had friends at the Education Department. In January 2018, just as Dream Center\u2019s schools lost their accreditation, Ronald L. Holt, a regulatory lawyer on the Dream Center team, sent a presentation to Dream Center executives on the state of higher education a year into the Trump administration. It included a song he wrote titled, \u201cYou\u2019ve Got a Friend in Trump,\u201d to the tune of Randy Newman\u2019s \u201cYou\u2019ve Got a Friend in Me,\u201d used in the movie \u201cToy Story.\u201d",

            "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Students who said they were discriminated against because of their sexual orientation or gender identity were significantly less likely to get any relief from the Education Department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights under the Trump administration than they were under the Obama administration, according to a report released Monday. The report, released by the liberal Center for American Progress and based on the Education Department\u2019s own data, provided the first analysis of how students who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or queer have fared in the first half of the Trump administration. The administration has reshaped policy to exclude civil rights protections for transgender people in most areas of government and has scaled back legal protections for gay people. The report found that the Trump administration was less likely to investigate claims of discrimination filed by the students \u2014 and more likely to dismiss them. The percentage of complaints that resulted in a school being required to take action to remedy the discrimination under the current administration was nine times lower than under the Obama administration, it concluded. In 2017, just weeks after the new administration took office, the Education and Justice Departments rescinded an Obama-era guidance document that informed schools that denying students access to bathrooms that correspond with their gender identity was a violation under Title IX, the federal law that prohibits sex discrimination in institutions that receive federal funding. The Trump administration believed, as many conservatives had long argued, that the Obama administration\u2019s guidance amounted to overreach and was inconsistent with federal law. The Education Department has adopted the administration\u2019s position, issued in a  memo by the Justice Department, that gender identity is not covered under federal civil rights laws. But Betsy DeVos, the education secretary, who reportedly protested the swiftness of the document\u2019s revocation, has said that while the department would no longer investigate bathroom complaints, it would still enforce protections for L.G.B.T.Q. students who were bullied, penalized or harassed for failing to conform to sex-based stereotypes. That is not happening, the Center for American Progress said. \u201cThese data really show that Betsy DeVos is not doing her job,\u201d said Frank J. Bewkes, one of the report\u2019s authors. \u201cHer office just doesn\u2019t seem to care about enforcing civil rights for these students.\u201d Education Department officials released data this month that showed that students who have filed civil rights complaints under Ms. DeVos\u2019s leadership were \u201cserved more efficiently and effectively than students who filed civil rights complaints during the previous administration.\u201d The agency boasted that it has resolved, on average, nearly double the number of civil rights complaints per year compared with the prior eight fiscal years, and it noted a 60 percent increase in the number of complaint resolutions that required schools to make changes to protect students\u2019 civil rights. The department said that its own analysis of the complaint data for L.G.B.T.Q. students showed the same trend. \u201cThese data were selectively compiled by a left-wing interest group to tell an ideological story,\u201d said Liz Hill, a spokeswoman for the department. \u201cNo one should mistake this as unbiased. This department vigorously protects the civil rights of all students and will continue to do so to the fullest extent of the law.\u201d The data obtained by the Center for American Progress, which has served as a research center for Democratic interests, reflected complaints filed by students from March 2010 to May 2018 and cases resolved by the Office for Civil Rights from November 2010 to June 2018. The organization examined complaints of discrimination based on gender identity, sexual orientation and sexual orientation-related sex stereotyping under Title IX, and determined how the complaints were handled using resolution codes used by the Education Department. An overwhelming number of complaints, 75.9 percent, alleged sexual or gender harassment, and transgender students were overrepresented in the filings. The Office for Civil Rights was at least 54 percent more likely to investigate a sexual orientation and gender identity complaint under the Obama administration than it was under the Trump administration, according to the report. When complaints were investigated, 91.5 percent were dismissed or closed with no finding of wrongdoing, compared with 65.4 percent under the Obama administration. Ultimately, the Obama administration resolved 22.4 percent of such cases with a change to policy or practice that the department believed would benefit the student, compared with 2.4 percent under the Trump administration, the group concluded. The Education Department said that its own analysis of the complaint categories showed that it was averaging more resolutions requiring schools to make a change than the previous administration \u2014 emphasizing the complaints acted on, not the complaints that went unanswered. It said the current administration averages 11 resolutions that required a change each year, compared with nine averaged under the Obama administration. In fiscal year 2018, the agency obtained more resolutions with change in these categories than the previous administration had achieved in any one year. Department officials acknowledged that the previous administration fared better when looking broadly at how all cases were resolved \u2014 which is what the Center for American Progress did \u2014 but noted that the previous administration\u2019s numbers appear better because it resolved fewer cases. \u201cA parent wants to know, if their child\u2019s civil rights are being violated, will O.C.R. provide for a change,\u201d Ms. Hill said, referring to the department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights. \u201cUnder this administration, it is more likely that it will. The numbers speak for themselves if assessed objectively.\u201d But critics say the department\u2019s metric for success ignores a large volume of students. \u201cIf you\u2019re just rushing through complaints, it\u2019s not surprising that you would resolve a large volume,\u201d said Shabab Ahmed Mirza, an author of the center\u2019s report. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve found is that more students are having cases resolved and not seeing justice. They\u2019re not talking about students who see no change at all.\u201d Ms. Mirza said that one finding in particular undercut the department\u2019s claim that the Obama administration\u2019s civil rights office was pushing a political agenda. Of the complaints that were investigated, the Obama administration was twice as likely to find after an investigation that a school had not violated students\u2019 rights. Catherine E. Lhamon, who led the Office for Civil Rights under the Obama administration and issued the transgender guidance, said that was because her administration was \u201cinvestigating the facts where they lead, and calling balls and strikes as they were.\u201d \u201cTo receive the signoff that you have not harmed children, it\u2019s a very significant resolution and it means a lot,\u201d Ms. Lhamon said. \u201cWhat the Trump administration is doing is not even examining whether anyone\u2019s been harmed. There\u2019s a benefit to examining whether a student has been discriminated against, even when the answer is no.\u201d",

            "content": " Education Secretary Betsy DeVos on Friday significantly tightened Obama-era rules for student borrowers who say their schools defrauded them, imposing a deadline on claims and eliminating a requirement that the department automatically wipe away the loans of some students whose schools closed while they were enrolled. The new rules apply to federal student loans made from July 2020 onward. They will replace a set of policies, completed by the Obama administration in 2016, that Ms. DeVos had delayed carrying out until a court ordered her to do so last year. Under the new rules, borrowers seeking loan forgiveness will have much higher hurdles to clear. They will need to prove that their college made a deceptive statement \u201cwith knowledge of its false, misleading or deceptive nature or with reckless disregard for the truth,\u201d and that they relied on the claim in deciding to enroll or stay at the school. They will also need to show that the deception harmed them financially. There is currently no time limit on submitting claims, but Ms. DeVos set a three-year deadline from the date that students graduate or leave their school. \u201cWe believe that within three years, the borrower will know whether or not there has been misrepresentation,\u201d Diane Auer Jones, the Education Department\u2019s principal deputy under secretary, said Friday on a call with reporters. The new rules also eliminate the \u201cautomatic closed school discharge,\u201d a program that wipes away the loans of students whose school closed before they could complete their degree. Students who do not transfer their credits elsewhere can apply to have their loans erased, but many do not know about the option and never apply. The 2016 rules required the department to automatically eliminate their debts if the students did not enroll elsewhere within three years. That approach has contributed to the discharge of $222 million in loans owed by nearly 20,000 borrowers, according to Education Department data gathered by the National Student Legal Defense Network, an advocacy group. The new rules from Ms. DeVos will cut debt forgiveness for borrowers by around $500 million a year compared with the 2016 rules if they were in full effect, the Education Department said in its draft of the changes. The tightening of debt relief is the latest in a series of moves by the Trump administration to roll back Obama-era regulations aimed at for-profit colleges and universities. In June, Ms. DeVos officially repealed a rule that sought to crack down on for-profit colleges and universities that produced graduates with no meaningful job prospects and mountains of student debt they could not hope to repay. In 2018, the Education Department unwound a special unit detailed to investigate fraud in the for-profit sector. Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, called the latest changes \u201canother Trump-DeVos giveaway to their for-profit college cronies at the expense of defrauded student borrowers.\u201d Consumer advocates said they planned to challenge the new rules in court. Rolling back the 2016 rules will \u201cencourage schools to break the law, engage in risky practices that lead to abrupt closures and harm students with impunity,\u201d said Abby Shafroth, a lawyer with the National Consumer Law Center. For two years, Ms. DeVos has \u201crefused to follow existing law and cancel the loans for these students, leaving them in debt they can\u2019t get away from,\u201d said Eileen Connor, legal director of the Project on Predatory Student Lending. \u201cNow, she\u2019s shredding a set of fair, common-sense rules that level the playing field between students and those who take advantage of them.\u201d The federal government is the primary financier for Americans borrowing to attend college \u2014 it has made or backed more than $1.4 trillion in student loans to nearly 43 million people. Borrowers must repay their loans even if they drop out, are unhappy with their education or cannot find a job in the field they trained for. But the government contracts include one escape clause: Borrowers can seek to have their loans eliminated if they can demonstrate that their school defrauded them or broke certain laws. The clause, known as \u201cborrower defense to repayment,\u201d was little used for decades, until a wave of large, for-profit chain failures began in 2014, when Corinthian Colleges collapsed. Caught off guard by a deluge of claims, the Obama administration struggled to create a process for managing and adjudicating them. It eventually approved or set in motion approvals on nearly 48,000 claims, many of them in the last few weeks of President Barack Obama\u2019s term, eliminating $600 million in borrower debt. But when Ms. DeVos took over, the process stalled. The department had nearly 180,000 pending claims as of March 30, and had not approved or denied any in more than a year. Those cases must still be evaluated under the rules in place when the loans were made. Many of the claims relate to false promises by for-profit schools about their graduates\u2019 career prospects. In a coordinated crackdown, state attorneys general and Obama-era federal regulators brought a series of lawsuits against schools that saddled students with high debts for subpar educations. Several large chains, including Corinthian and ITT Educational Services, went under. The Obama administration granted full loan discharges to the borrower defense claims that it approved, but Ms. DeVos tried a new tactic, discharging only a portion of the debt owed by some Corinthian students. A federal judge in California blocked that approach last year, ruling that the department had violated privacy laws by improperly obtaining information from the Social Security Administration on individual applicants\u2019 earnings. The department appealed the decision and is waiting for a court ruling before it addresses those borrowers\u2019 claims, Ms. Jones said. \u201cWe are diligently working to see if there is a different methodology we could employ so we can resolve those claims,\u201d she said. Some people, like Jessica Jacobson, have been waiting for more than four years for a decision on their claim. In June, she and six others asked the federal court in the Northern District of California to compel the Education Department to make decisions on their cases. Ms. Jacobson earned a bachelor\u2019s degree from the New England Institute of Art, which she hoped would lead to a career in visual effects. She picked the school, she said, because it marketed its industry connections and state-of-the-art technology. But the equipment was scarce and obsolete, she said, and the school\u2019s career support was limited to pointing students toward public job postings and giving them handouts like one titled \u201cTips for Applying to a Job From Craigslist.\u201d After her graduation, Ms. Jacobson worked a succession of low-wage retail and restaurant jobs. The New England Institute of Art closed in 2017. The Massachusetts attorney general sued its former operators last year, accusing the school of predatory recruiting tactics and of deceiving students by misrepresenting its job placement rates. Ms. Jacobson sent her borrower defense claim to the Education Department in March 2015, seeking to have $25,000 in federal loans forgiven. While the claim has been pending, she has held off on several major life decisions, including a marriage proposal from her boyfriend. If the claim is denied, she said, she does not want him to be ensnared in her debt. \u201cI\u2019m in limbo,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the government is going to decide to do, and this debt is just hanging over my head. I feel trapped by it.\u201d",

            "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump said Friday that the United States had reached an interim deal with China that would forestall a tariff increase slated for next week, providing a temporary d\u00e9tente in a prolonged and economically painful trade war. Mr. Trump, speaking from the Oval Office, said negotiators had reached a \u201cPhase 1\u201d agreement that would take several weeks to write and that both sides could officially sign by November. If completed, the agreement would provide relief to American farmers and businesses that have been battered by the trade war. Mr. Trump said the \u201csubstantial\u201d agreement would involve China buying $40 billion to $50 billion worth of American agricultural products annually, along with guidelines on how it manages its currency, the renminbi. It would also strengthen Chinese protections for American intellectual property and give financial services companies more access to China\u2019s market, the president said. In exchange, the United States will not move ahead next week with plans to raise tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods to 30 percent. The president has not made a final decision on whether to impose an additional round of tariffs on Dec. 15, as he has threatened. The announcement is a sharp turn from Mr. Trump\u2019s posture several weeks ago, when the president \u2014 angry over China\u2019s retaliatory tariffs \u2014 demanded that American companies stop doing business with China and threatened to tax every toy, shoe and computer from Beijing before the year\u2019s end. The escalation has rattled investors, lawmakers and businesses, which have begun delaying investment and hiring amid continuing uncertainty about the trade war\u2019s trajectory. The economic pain appears to have softened Mr. Trump\u2019s appetite for a fight. On Friday, the president said the two sides would now work on a deal in phases, a reversal from his previous position that he was looking for a \u201ccomplete\u201d China deal, not an interim agreement. \u201cIt\u2019s such a big deal that doing it in sections, in phases, is really better,\u201d Mr. Trump said during a White House meeting with Liu He, China\u2019s vice premier. \u201cSo you\u2019ll either have two phases or three phases.\u201d The first phase could be signed when Mr. Trump appears alongside Xi Jinping, his Chinese counterpart, at a meeting of global leaders in Santiago, Chile, in November. The next phase would begin soon after, Mr. Trump said. Despite the announcement, the deal has not been completed, and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said that more work remained, including on the agreements related to currency and access for American financial companies. \u201cWe have a fundamental agreement on the key issues,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there is a significant amount of work to do.\u201d The deal is far from the type of comprehensive agreement Mr. Trump has been pushing for, and it leaves some of the administration\u2019s biggest concerns about China\u2019s economic practices unresolved. Although exact terms are still under discussion, the details the president announced include some of the concessions that China has previously floated, including purchases of agricultural products and limits on Beijing devaluing its currency to gain a competitive advantage. Still, the agreement, which came during the 13th round of negotiations, will help to defuse trade tensions that have begun inflicting pain on the global economy and bolster business across the Pacific. In his quest to force China to acquiesce to America\u2019s terms, Mr. Trump has already taxed $360 billion worth of Chinese products and had penciled in another round of tariffs on Dec. 15. Stock and commodity prices climbed on Friday as investors anticipated a resolution to the trade spat. The S&P 500 rose 1.1 percent. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 1.3 percent. The Russell 2000 index of small capitalization stocks, typically viewed as closely tied to the health of the American domestic economy, rose 1.8 percent. Crude oil prices rose, as did prices for key industrial metals such as copper and iron ore, often looked to as a barometer of the outlook for China\u2019s large industrial economy. Stocks of companies with heavy exposure to China soared. Shares of Deere & Company rose 1.9 percent, while Apple gained 2.7 percent and Wynn Resorts, which generates the bulk of its revenue from casinos in China, surged 6.3 percent. An index of semiconductor companies, which depend on Asian supply chains, gained 2.3 percent. Business groups expressed relief that the negotiations between the United States and China appeared to be making progress after more than a year of sputtering, yet they acknowledged that the agreement fell short of the sweeping deal that Mr. Trump had promised. John Neuffer, the president of the Semiconductor Industry Association, said the deal was \u201cwelcome news\u201d for his industry that would give \u201cboth sides a chance to get back to the negotiating table to strike a more comprehensive deal.\u201d The initial reaction among Republican lawmakers was cautiously optimistic. Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the Republican chairman of the Finance Committee, said that any progress was good news, but that Mr. Trump must reach a more substantial deal for the pain of the trade war to have been worthwhile. \u201cAfter so much has been sacrificed, Americans will settle for nothing less than a full, enforceable and fair deal with China,\u201d Mr. Grassley said. \u201cI look forward to learning more details in the coming days.\u201d Trade experts in China were quick to welcome the deal as a breakthrough. \u201cIt the first time since the start of the trade war that negotiators have reached some solid result,\u201d said Cui Fan, a prominent professor of trade policy at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing. Mr. Trump\u2019s defenders say China\u2019s concessions will generate positive momentum for future talks and result in more business for farmers and manufacturers as they continue to press Beijing for a broader pact to correct longstanding economic abuses. Critics say that the move will go only part way toward resolving a crisis of the president\u2019s own making, and that the trade war will continue to slow the global economy. \u201cBehind the hype, this is nothing more than a partial and ostensibly unsustainable deal lacking in real enforcement mechanism,\u201d said Gregory Daco, the chief United States economist at Oxford Economics. \u201cFor businesses, this will mean less damage, not greater certainty.\u201d The interim agreement also does not resolve some of the thorniest issues between the two countries, including whether the United States will continue to label China a currency manipulator and whether it will keep Huawei, the Chinese telecom giant, on a government blacklist. In August, the Treasury Department formally designated China a currency manipulator for the first time since 1994, at the direction of Mr. Trump. The largely symbolic move came amid frustration among American officials that China was counteracting the president\u2019s tariffs by devaluing the renminbi. Mr. Mnuchin said that the United States would decide whether to rescind the designation in a future phase of negotiations. And Robert Lighthizer, Mr. Trump\u2019s top trade negotiator, said the deal did not resolve the fate of Huawei, which is banned from buying American products \u2014 much to China\u2019s dismay. \u201cIn this agreement we\u2019re not dealing specifically with Huawei,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not part of this agreement. That\u2019s a separate process.\u201d Mr. Trump and his advisers also did not mention any progress in areas that the American business community has identified as critical to its ability to compete with Chinese companies \u2014 including China\u2019s subsidization of industries, the role of the government in the economy and the country\u2019s restrictions on transfers of data across its borders. \u201cOur hope and our aspiration is that they get to those harder issues,\u201d said Myron Brilliant, the head of international affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Still, he added that the steps taken this week might create positive momentum toward addressing those issues. \u201cWe\u2019ve had nothing but bad news since May in the U.S.-China relationship,\u201d Mr. Brilliant said. \u201cAnd now we seemed to have put a halt to a further escalation of tensions, and that\u2019s a step in the right direction.\u201d Mr. Lighthizer said that the deal would require China to make structural changes to how it screened food imports and approved new genetically modified products that would allow more American farm goods to flow there. \u201cIt will be much easier now for American farmers to be able to ship to China,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve made some changes on our side too that will help the Chinese.\u201d The agreement came after Chinese officials shifted their position on the trade talks over the past month, moving from an insistence on a complete removal of American tariffs to a willingness to accept a partial deal that would leave many of those tariffs in place. One important factor in China\u2019s shifting stance involved a severe yet unexpected problem: a genuine need for food imports from the United States. African swine fever has killed an estimated two fifths of China\u2019s pig herd over the past year, producing a sharp increase in pork prices. The need for increased food imports from the United States persuaded the Chinese that both sides could benefit from a partial deal even if it did not involve complete elimination of Mr. Trump\u2019s new tariffs, a person familiar with the talks said. Mr. Trump acknowledged that tensions with China had spiraled as a result of the trade war but said that relations between the two countries were now \u201ca love fest.\u201d \u201cTalk was getting tough,\u201d the president said, adding that both sides had \u201cplanes\u201d and \u201cships\u201d and that \u201cstupid things can happen.\u201d",

            "content": " One called President Trump\u2019s decision \u201can egregious act of betrayal.\u201d Another said the policy could be \u201cthe biggest mistake of his presidency.\u201d A third said Mr. Trump \u201cis in danger of losing the mandate of heaven.\u201d Conservative Christians have ardently stood by Mr. Trump at most every turn, from allegations of sexual misconduct to his policy of separating migrant families at the border and the Russia investigation. But this week, some of Mr. Trump\u2019s top evangelical supporters broke rank to raise alarms over his move to withdraw troops from Syria, which prompted Turkish forces to launch a ground and air assault against a Kurdish-led militia that has been a crucial ally in the American fight against ISIS. As Turkish warplanes began to bomb Syrian towns on Wednesday, the prominent evangelist Franklin Graham called for Mr. Trump to reconsider his decision, and worried that the Kurds \u2014 and the Christian minorities in the region they have defended \u2014 could be annihilated. \u201cWe have many friends in the Kurdish areas,\u201d said Mr. Graham, whose humanitarian organization, Samaritan\u2019s Purse, has done relief work in the region. \u201cWe know people on the ground.\u201d The concern resonated for many conservative evangelicals who have supported Mr. Trump, and called into question his much-touted commitment to religious freedom, a top value for his base. The opposition has arrived at an inopportune time for the president. The administration is weathering a heated battle with Congress, and according to a Fox News poll, more than half of voters now support the president\u2019s impeachment. Tony Perkins, who leads the Family Research Council, is calling on the administration to actively demonstrate its support for persecuted religious minorities in the aftermath of the withdrawal. \u201cThis is inconsistent with what the president has done,\u201d he said. Erick Erickson, a well-known conservative evangelical blogger, wrote on Twitter that Mr. Trump had committed \u201can egregious act of betrayal\u201d to the Kurds. \u201cShame on him,\u201d he said. Pat Robertson, founder of the Christian Broadcasting Network, said he was \u201cappalled\u201d by the president\u2019s decision, and added that \u201cthe president of the United States is in great danger of losing the mandate of heaven if he permits this to happen.\u201d Senator Lindsey Graham, who rarely breaks with the president, said it could be \u201cthe biggest mistake of his presidency.\u201d Current disappointment is unlikely to translate into substantial or lasting opposition. And not all evangelical supporters have taken issue with Mr. Trump\u2019s decision. Robert Jeffress, pastor of First Baptist Dallas and a prominent supporter of Mr. Trump, said he \u201chappily\u201d deferred to the commander in chief, and he praised Mr. Trump for carrying through on a campaign promise to end American involvement in Middle Eastern conflicts. \u201cSome evangelicals may disagree with the president\u2019s decision,\u201d Mr. Jeffress said, \u201cbut I guarantee you there is not one evangelical supporter of the president who would switch their vote and support Elizabeth Warren or Joe Biden over a Syria decision.\u201d Franklin Graham stopped short of condemning Mr. Trump\u2019s policy outright. The evangelist said he communicated with the president or vice president \u2014 he would not specify which leader \u2014 about the troop withdrawal within the last 48 hours, and said he ultimately deferred to their determinations. He declined to give specifics of his conversation. \u201cThere are so many other issues at stake here,\u201d he said, listing things such as Turkey\u2019s membership in NATO and U.S. military bases in the country. \u201cIt is a very hard decision.\u201d Mr. Perkins pointed to the administration\u2019s other efforts for religious freedom, and said that \u201cone incident doesn\u2019t make an administration.\u201d Religious freedom, like anti-abortion policy and conservative judges, has often been a point of pride for many of Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters. At the United Nations last month, Mr. Trump earned praise from supporters for highlighting religious freedom instead of prioritizing a major climate summit. As Mr. Trump\u2019s call with the president of Ukraine roiled Washington last week, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, an evangelical who often weaves together Christianity and foreign policy, spoke on religious freedom in Rome. This summer, around the time of the Mueller hearings on Capitol Hill, the State Department convened a celebrated gathering to advance global religious freedom. Conservative Christians can point to the administration\u2019s priority of defending religious freedom, but action and policy are more revealing than words, said Meighan Stone, an evangelical Christian and senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cIf this administration can\u2019t be good allies to the Kurds in this battle, where is this policy that is supposed to be protecting persecuted religious minorities around the world?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt is nonexistent.\u201d When asked about human rights abuses of non-Christian communities, or in regions that are not as tied to biblical history \u2014 for example, how China has targeted Uighurs and other largely Muslim minorities in the autonomous region of Xinjiang \u2014 Mr. Graham demurred. \u201cI am not familiar with these people,\u201d Mr. Graham said of the Uighurs, noting that he had not visited the region. \u201cI\u2019d certainly condemn China for, it\u2019s not just the Uighurs, they\u2019ve been destroying churches.\u201d Churches across Christian traditions \u2014 Catholic, Orthodox and Protestant \u2014 often share spiritual and personal ties to congregations in the Middle East, praying for their pastors or families by name, or inviting them to speak when they visit the United States. Many church leaders galvanized support in 2014 when ISIS fighters targeted, killed and raped fleeing religious minorities, including Christians and Yazidis. Now, that fear is remerging and motivating evangelical alarm, explained Jeremy Courtney, who leads a relief effort called Preemptive Love that works in northeastern Syria and in the Al Hol tent camp, which has been described as a growing hotbed of ISIS fighters and their families. \u201cAnother way to view it is Christian self-interest, that if ISIS reconstitutes, then there will be another ISIS genocide against Christians, and maybe Arabs get killed, maybe Yazidis will get killed, but the subtle undercurrent is that maybe Christians will get killed,\u201d said Mr. Courtney, who was raised as an evangelical in Texas and has lived north of Baghdad for almost 13 years. \u201cThat is a legitimate concern, it is just disturbing to me,\u201d he said. \u201cChristians speaking out on this should be concerned about the Muslims who will lose their lives because of this policy as well.\u201d The troop withdrawal in Syria is likely to be a topic of conversation this weekend at the Values Voter Summit in Washington, where President Trump is scheduled to speak to hundreds of conservative leaders. At the event, the evangelical pastor Andrew Brunson, whom Turkey accused of spying and detained for two years, will receive an award marking the one-year anniversary of his release. For many conservative Christians, Mr. Brunson has become a symbol of the Trump administration\u2019s commitment to protecting persecuted Christians in unfriendly regions. This week, Mr. Trump said on Twitter that America\u2019s relationship with Turkey \u201chas been very good.\u201d In a phone call on Thursday evening, Mr. Brunson said the decision to withdraw troops from Syria and the ensuing Turkish attack have left him \u201cdistressed.\u201d He spoke of the refugees he met working in the Syrian-Turkish border region, including friends who had converted to Christianity and who were currently in Kobani, a Syrian town now under Turkish assault. \u201cI don\u2019t think Turkey is a friend of the West anymore,\u201d Mr. Brunson said. \u201cThis is a point of great concern to me, obviously.\u201d",

            "content": " Ms. Yovanovitch delivered her searing account before Congress at the risk of losing her job, since the White House has ordered officials not to cooperate with the impeachment inquiry. This afternoon I stopped by the desk of Sharon LaFraniere, who has written about Ms. Yovanovitch, to discuss why the former ambassador to Ukraine was so intent on speaking out. Sharon, how unusual was her participation? And how unusual was her testimony? She testified despite a White House declaration that there would be no more cooperation with Congress. She\u2019s acting in defiance of the White House. Her testimony today was a really damning indictment of how the Trump administration is conducting foreign policy. She warned against people who in search of personal gain or private influence undermined the work of American government officials and threatened the policy goals of the United States. And on top of all that, she said the State Department is being hollowed out from within, because diplomats don\u2019t feel the government has their back. What does she know that House Democrats want to know? She seemed to suggest that businesspeople who are allies of Rudy Giuliani may have orchestrated this campaign to get her out for their own private gain. Was she removed because she was standing in the way of some sort of quid pro quo deal that the White House was planning to execute? Did they see her as unwilling to play ball in what might have been a corrupt game? Those are the questions impeachment investigators want to answer. \u201cSmart, charismatic, ruthless, a little megalomaniacal.\u201d \u201cAmbitious, righteous, then self-righteous.\u201d \u201cPersonable ... for a little while.\u201d \u201cDecisive, combative, conspiratorial.\u201d \u201cPugilistic, erratic, extremely smart, reckless.\u201d \u201cForceful, combative, energetic, vindictive, tireless, annoying.\u201d That\u2019s Rudy Giuliani, as described by our reporters who have covered him over the past 35 years. A forthcoming episode of The Weekly traces his path from crime-busting prosecutor to Donald Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, now at the center of the impeachment inquiry. The episode focuses in part on a brutal zinger \u2014 that Mr. Giuliani needed only \u201ca noun and a verb and 9/11\u201d to construct a sentence \u2014 that was delivered by none other than Joe Biden, which helped sink the former New York City mayor\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign. \u201cGiuliani did not like that line. I don\u2019t think he ever forgot that Biden said it,\u201d my colleague Maggie Haberman says on the show. To better understand how we got to this point, I called Dan Barry, who appears in The Weekly episode and has chronicled Mr. Giuliani for decades. What do you see in Rudy today that reminds you of the guy you\u2019ve covered for so many years? There\u2019s this combativeness, that need to be at the center of attention \u2014 the willingness to go almost anywhere to champion whatever the cause of the moment is for him. All those character traits on display now are quite familiar to anyone who followed him closely 20 or 30 years ago. But the Rudy we see now is also at odds with the Rudy of the \u201980s and \u201990s, with his moral rectitude then. He was Mr. Law and Order. Why, after so many years in the public eye, did he want to work for Mr. Trump? He was leading in the polls in the 2007 to be the Republican nominee for president. He was spending oodles of money. He was getting a lot of ink. And then it all evaporated. He spent millions and ended up with one delegate. That stung. He was an international hero, and then was roundly rejected. He always wanted to be relevant. He needed to be relevant. What happened in 2016? He becomes relevant. Now, he\u2019s effectively the shadow secretary of state. I think he revels in that.

            "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump\u2019s accounting firm must comply with a House committee\u2019s demands for eight years of his financial records, a federal appeals court panel ruled on Friday in a major victory for House Democrats in their struggle against his vow to stonewall \u201call\u201d of their oversight subpoenas. In a 66-page ruling, the panel rejected Mr. Trump\u2019s argument that Congress had no legitimate legislative authority to seek his business records from the firm, Mazars USA, because the committee was trying to determine whether he broke existing laws \u2014 not weighing whether to enact a new one. \u201cHaving considered the weighty issues at stake in this case, we conclude that the subpoena issued by the committee to Mazars is valid and enforceable,\u201d wrote Judge David S. Tatel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Mr. Trump is virtually certain to appeal the ruling, either to the full Court of Appeals or to the Supreme Court. But the decision \u2014 affirming an earlier ruling by a Federal District Court judge \u2014 was the first test at the appeals court level of the Trump legal team\u2019s sweeping challenges to the constitutional authority of Congress to conduct oversight of his activities. Judge Tatel was joined by Judge Patricia A. Millett in the majority of the three-judge ruling. Both were appointed by Democratic presidents. Judge Neomi Rao, a former Trump administration official whom Mr. Trump appointed to the bench in March, dissented, saying she would have quashed the subpoena as exceeding the House\u2019s legislative powers. Representative Elijah E. Cummings, the Democratic chairman of the oversight committee, hailed the appeals court\u2019s decision. \u201cToday\u2019s ruling is a fundamental and resounding victory for congressional oversight, our constitutional system of checks and balances and the rule of law,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cFor far too long, the president has placed his personal interests over the interests of the American people.\u201d Lawyers for Mr. Trump were reviewing the decision, said one, Jay Sekulow. \u201cWe continue to believe that this subpoena is not a legitimate exercise of Congress\u2019s legislative authority,\u201d he said. Sarah E. Sutton, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department, declined to comment on the ruling. The scope of Congress\u2019s power to compel the production of information \u2014 and the president\u2019s power to keep information secret \u2014 has emerged as a recurring battleground between House Democrats and Mr. Trump, whose legal team has put forth novel legal arguments in carrying out his vow to systematically defy House subpoenas. This week, Mr. Trump\u2019s White House counsel, Pat A. Cipollone, sent a letter to the House declaring that the administration would not cooperate with the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry, such as by providing documents or permitting witnesses to testify. The Trump legal team has separately argued that Mr. Trump\u2019s current and former White House aides are absolutely immune from subpoenas for their testimony \u2014 meaning they would not even have to show up \u2014 and that Congress lacks legitimate legislative authority to scrutinize potential wrongdoing in the executive branch. The appeals court ruling on Friday centered on that third argument, and it was in some respects already obsolete because the premise of the argument was that the House was relying only on its routine legislative and oversight authorities, rather than any extra investigative powers that lawmakers gain when engaged in an impeachment inquiry. But since the Mazars case started going through the courts, the House Judiciary Committee and Speaker Nancy Pelosi have declared that the chamber is conducting an impeachment inquiry. The Trump administration has disputed that premise, since the full House has not voted for a resolution approving such an investigation. Friday\u2019s ruling did not address the question of whether an impeachment inquiry is underway \u2014 and, if so, whether that matters. The majority on the panel ruled for the House without any need to invoke its impeachment powers. Specifically, the fight centered on whether the House Oversight and Reform Committee had the authority to compel Mazars to turn over Mr. Trump\u2019s financial records as part of its routine legislative and oversight powers, even if the committee\u2019s purpose was in part to determine whether Mr. Trump committed crimes. The committee, led by Mr. Cummings, issued the subpoena after it came to light that Mr. Trump had failed to list on his ethics disclosure forms a debt that he owed and then repaid to his former lawyer and fixer, Michael D. Cohen, for paying hush money to a pornographic actress just before the 2016 election to keep quiet about an affair she claimed to have had with Mr. Trump. He has denied the relationship. Mr. Cohen also testified before Congress that Mr. Trump routinely changed the value of his assets for different financial purposes, like inflating their value for loan applications but deflating them for taxes. (Mr. Cohen was separately convicted of lying to Congress in earlier testimony.) In making the request for documents and then issuing the subpoena, Mr. Cummings said that Congress was trying to determine whether the president had broken laws, but he also said that lawmakers were trying to decide whether to update financial disclosure laws. Mr. Trump\u2019s legal team, which sued Mazars to obtain a court order blocking it from complying with the subpoena, argued that this meant the committee was effectively trying to carry out a criminal investigation. That, they asserted, was an executive branch job, not a legislative one, and so the House\u2019s subpoena was invalid. But Judge Tatel wrote that Supreme Court precedent granted broad authority to Congress to issue subpoenas for information that could be used to enact new laws \u2014 even if it could also be useful as criminal evidence \u2014 and imposed no requirement on lawmakers to say that legislation was their specific purpose. In any case, he also wrote, Mr. Cummings had made reference to investigating whether new legislation was necessary. \u201cWe conclude that the public record reveals legitimate legislative pursuits, not an impermissible law enforcement purpose, behind the committee\u2019s subpoena,\u201d he wrote. Judge Rao disagreed. Lawyers for the House, led by their counsel Douglas Letter, had relied only on the House\u2019s normal oversight powers in support of the subpoena, she noted, arguing that permitting lawmakers to pursue such information without an impeachment inquiry would make it too easy to harass the presidency. \u201cWhen the House chooses to investigate the president for alleged violations of the laws and the Constitution, it must proceed through impeachment, an exceptional and solemn exercise of judicial power established as a separate check on public officials,\u201d she wrote. But Judge Rao did not address the House Democrats\u2019 more recent assertions that they are, in fact, already conducting an impeachment inquiry \u2014 nor the Trump administration\u2019s claims that there is no such inquiry for legal purposes. In a letter to Democrats celebrating the ruling, Ms. Pelosi wrote: \u201cThe president\u2019s actions threaten our national security, violate our Constitution and undermine the integrity of our elections. No one is above the law. The president will be held accountable.\u201d",

            "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump on Saturday night took his post-impeachment message of grievance and political warfare directly to the religious right, telling a group of social conservatives that Democrats were trying to undo the results of the 2016 campaign and \u201cstop our movement and impose their agenda by any means necessary.\u201d For the third consecutive night, Mr. Trump delivered a version of his combative response to the formal beginning of an impeachment inquiry declared last month by Speaker Nancy Pelosi, this time during an official presidential speech at the Values Voter Summit, an annual gathering of social conservatives in Washington. \u201cI think she hates our country,\u201d Mr. Trump said of Ms. Pelosi. \u201cIf she didn\u2019t hate our country, she wouldn\u2019t be doing this to our country. It\u2019s a fraud.\u201d After months of restraint, Ms. Pelosi last month charged Mr. Trump with betraying the nation\u2019s security by seeking to enlist a foreign government to damage a political rival for his own gain. Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks came after two nights of raucous campaign rallies, one in the progressive city of Minneapolis, and another in the deep-red district of Lake Charles, La. But at an official White House event on Saturday night, Mr. Trump delivered an almost indistinguishable message from behind a podium with a presidential seal. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d see or hear that word with regard to me,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cImpeachment. To me, it\u2019s an ugly word. It means so much; it means horrible, horrible crimes and things. I can\u2019t even believe it.\u201d From the start, the gathering was a chance for the president to frame the fast-moving impeachment inquiry as the latest chapter of a continuing effort by Democrats to damage him. At the event put on by the Family Research Council, Mr. Trump was introduced with a prayer for the Lord to \u201cexpose and reverse the plans of those who would hurt President Trump.\u201d Mr. Trump, who spoke for well over an hour on Saturday night, described himself as the innocent victim of a partisan conspiracy. \u201cFirst, it was the Russia hoax,\u201d he said. \u201cThen it was the outrageous smearing of Justice Kavanaugh.\u201d Mr. Trump said that \u201cnow it is the outrageous impeachment\u201d and added that \u201cthe hateful spirit that consumes the modern left violates every tenet of the American tradition.\u201d Later on Saturday night, Mr. Trump also gave a phone interview to the Fox News host Jeanine Pirro, making him one of the sole and omnipresent voices in the White House mounting a defense of his actions and an assault on Democrats as the impeachment inquiry barrels forward. Last weekend, Trump administration officials were absent from the cable news shows. Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have TV interviews scheduled for Sunday. But Mr. Trump has emerged, so far, as something of a one-man war room setting the tone for the White House\u2019s rebuttal to a constitutional and political showdown that could reshape his presidency and his legacy. On Saturday night, Mr. Trump did not attack former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, Jr., who is a central character in the House impeachment inquiry, which is investigating Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure Ukraine\u2019s president to come up with damaging information about the former vice president. But he singled out Ms. Pelosi, as well as Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, a favorite progressive foil he likes to hold up as an avatar for her party. \u201cLook at Omar, have you seen what she says?\u201d Mr. Trump said, accusing her of harboring deep anti-Semitic sentiments. \u201cShe meant it much more so than even her words,\u201d he said. He also accused Representative Adam B. Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, of \u201clying and cheating\u201d and said he had instructed his lawyers to sue him as a public relations gambit. \u201cI told my lawyers, sue him anyway, even if we lose the American public will understand,\u201d he said. Mr. Trump reverted to the coarse language he has employed in arena rally settings, even as he spoke in front of a religious audience. \u201cOther countries are looking at us like, what the hell is going on in the United States,\u201d he said. But he promised the audience that he would continue to defend religious liberty and that \u201cwe will win massive victories for family, faith \u2014 just like the victory we had in 2016.\u201d",

            "content": "   President Trump\u2019s surprise acquiescence to a Turkish incursion into northern Syria this week has shaken American allies, and not just because it was a betrayal of a loyal partner. What alarmed them even more was his sheer unpredictability. His inconsistent and rapidly shifting positions in the Middle East have injected a new element of chaos into an already volatile region and have left allies guessing where the United States stands and for how long. Previous American policymakers were clear about their intentions, said Mowaffak al-Rubaie, a former Iraqi national security adviser. \u201cThis guy is all emotional,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is unpredictable.\u201d The uncertainties only compound simmering worries about the durability of the American commitment to the Middle East. American presidents have been promising for almost 15 years to reduce the country\u2019s presence in the region, unnerving partners like Israel and the Persian Gulf monarchs that rely on American protection. But few American leaders have ever made and disclosed major foreign policy decisions with the speed and seeming improvisation that Mr. Trump does. No longer merely worried that Washington might withdraw, analysts say many allies are now concerned that this unpredictable commander in chief could bolt for an exit without warning. His decision to get out of the way of the Turkish incursion was apparently made on the spur of the moment during a phone call with the Turkish president, surprising many of Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers. It opened the door to a fierce Turkish assault on the American-backed militia led by the Syrian Kurds, which was key to the ground battle to retake territory captured by the Islamic State. Attacking the Kurds, in turn, risks an Islamic State comeback. This was just the latest in a series of flip-flops in American policy in the region, including two in Syria this year alone. In December, Mr. Trump promised to withdraw the entire contingent of about 2000 American forces there. But he later changed his mind, withdrawing about half. He has repeatedly warned that the United States was \u201clocked and loaded\u201d for military action against Iran. But when Iran shot down an American surveillance drone this summer, Mr. Trump reversed himself in the final minutes to call off a planned missile strike. Then last month, he denounced Iran for orchestrating an attack on Saudi oil facilities but declined to take military action. His hesitance made America\u2019s two most important allies in the region, Saudi Arabia and Israel, reassess the American commitment to the containment of Iran and, consequently, to their own security. Critics say that Mr. Trump\u2019s zigzagging policies have emboldened regional foes, unnerved American partners, and invited Russia and various regional players to seek to exert their influence. \u201cIt is chaos,\u201d said Michael Stephens, a scholar of the region at the Royal United Services Institute in London. \u201cThe region is in chaos because the hegemonic power does not seem to know what it wants to do, and so nobody else does.\u201d Even in Britain, which customarily keeps its Middle East policies tightly aligned with its superpower ally, \u201cnobody knows what to do any more, because you don\u2019t know what is coming next,\u201d Mr. Stephens said. \u201cDonald Trump is pouring gasoline on the fire and leaving a lot of us very confused.\u201d In his public defenses of his decision, Mr. Trump insists he is acting consistently and has suggested that he was fulfilling a campaign promise to get out of open-ended conflicts around the Middle East. \u201cI was elected on getting out of these ridiculous endless wars, where our great Military functions as a policing operation to the benefit of people who don\u2019t even like the USA,\u201d he wrote on Twitter on Monday. To critics, his shifting defenses of his decision are reminders of his fickleness. When Mr. Trump backed away from his decision to withdraw all American troops remaining in Syria, he appeared to accept the admonitions of his military chiefs and advisers about the dire consequences of an abrupt pull out. The presence of American troops in northern Syria had helped to preserve the area as a safe haven for the Kurdish-led militia that has been Washington\u2019s most critical ally on the ground in the fight against ISIS. Now that Kurdish-led militia is acting as jailers for tens of thousands of ISIS fighters and their families being held in camps and prisons in northern Syria near the Turkish border. The leaders of neighboring Turkey, which has battled Kurdish separatists at home for decades, saw the Syrian Kurdish militia as a threat and talked openly of a cross border campaign to crush it \u2014 if only the American troops got out of the way. But despite the warnings about a United States interest in protecting its loyal Kurdish allies and in containing the ISIS prisoners, Mr. Trump this week portrayed the plights of the Kurds as someone else\u2019s problem. Referring to the Turks and Kurds as \u201cnatural enemies,\u201d he said, \u201cIt is time now for others in the region, some of great wealth, to protect their own country.\u201d As soon as Mr. Trump moved the fewer than a hundred American troops from a border area, Turkey unleashed its cross border assault on Wednesday. By Friday, there was evidence that ISIS was already attempting to regroup amid the chaos. Five militants had escaped from a Kurdish-run prison and ISIS claimed responsibility for a bombing in a provincial capital. With the White House still reeling from the withering criticism aimed at President Trump by his fellow Republicans for essentially abandoning America\u2019s Kurdish allies, the administration announced on Saturday evening that it would release $50 million in \u201cstabilization assistance for Syria to protect persecuted ethnic and religious minorities, and advance human rights.\u201d Syria has not been a direct recipient of American aid in years, and the announcement said little about how it would be spent. But it was clear that it was a response to critiques that by pulling back on the American military presence in the Kurdish-controlled areas, Mr. Trump unleashed a military and humanitarian crisis. The White House said the funds would help \u201cSyrian human rights defenders, civil society organizations, and reconciliation efforts directly supporting ethnic and religious minority victims of the conflict.\u201d And it discussed removing \u201cexplosive remnants of war, community security for stabilization assistance, documenting human rights abuses and international humanitarian law violations, and support for survivors of gender-based violence and torture.\u201d But it sidestepped the issue of how to make such aid work on the ground in the midst of conflict. And some of Mr. Trump\u2019s former national security aides warned of further troubles. \u201cWe have got to keep the pressure on ISIS so they don\u2019t recover,\u201d former Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis said in a pretaped interview for NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d Mr. Mattis, who resigned late last year when Mr. Trump first announced a Syria withdrawal, suggested that the president\u2019s political desires to pull back troops was risky. \u201dWe may want a war over; we may even declare it over,\u201d Mr. Mattis said. \u201cYou can pull your troops out \u2014 as President Obama learned the hard way \u2014 out of Iraq, but the \u2018enemy gets the vote\u2019, we say in the military. And in this case, if we don\u2019t keep the pressure on, then ISIS will resurge.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely a given that they will come back,\u201d he concluded. The decision to allow the Turkish advance came less than a month after Mr. Trump spooked American partners in the region by appearing to back down from another confrontation, that one against Iran. Mr. Trump has levied sweeping economic sanctions against Iran since May in an attempt to coerce its leaders into accepting strict restrictions on their military capabilities and nuclear energy program. During the escalating confrontation over the sanctions, he has frequently expressed a willingness to use military force against Iran. Then, according to the administration, Iran retaliated against the American sanctions by orchestrating a missile strike against the most important oil facility of Washington\u2019s most important Arab ally, Saudi Arabia. And Mr. Trump disclaimed any responsibility. \u201cThat was an attack on Saudi Arabia, and that wasn\u2019t an attack on us,\u201d he said. Other countries are scurrying to adapt to the new reality. \u201cI think many nations around the Middle East now are considering major changes in their strategic defense plans because they no longer see the United States as a reliable ally,\u201d said Gamal Abdel Gawad Soltan, an adviser to the state-sponsored Al Ahram Center for Strategic Studies in Cairo. \u201cI think it will be very difficult to convince nations of the Middle East that the United States is serious about what it says, and this is a major change in the strategic landscape of the Middle East.\u201d America\u2019s enemies, some analysts say, may also be taking note. \u201cIf you are someone that is a rival on the other side \u2014 you\u2019re Iranian, Russian, Turkish, ISIS, Hezbollah \u2014 you understand that this is the time for gain,\u201d argued Shimrit Meir, columnist for the Israeli newspaper Yediot Ahronot. \u201cThis is the hour. Because when the president of the United States is going all the way, saying \u2018I hate military interference in the Middle East, and this is why I was elected, to stop this\u2019 \u2014 then it\u2019s not rocket science for the Iranians to understand that they have a lot of room for maneuver.\u201d American involvement in the Middle East rose steadily after the United States emerged as a superpower at the end of World War II. But since the American military presence in the region reached its apex with the invasion of Iraq in 2003, presidents from both parties have tried to cut back. President Obama sought to pull out of Afghanistan but instead sent a surge of more troops to try to achieve enough stability to ease a withdrawal \u2014 a gambit that failed to achieve that goal. He withdrew American troops from Iraq in 2011. But his critics say the pullout enabled the emergence of the Islamic State, which seized a large portion of Iraq and Syria in 2014, drawing the United States military back in. Mr. Obama\u2019s experience might now serve as a cautionary tale to Mr. Trump, who risks allowing a resurgence of the Islamic State by pulling back in Syria, argued Michele Dunne, a scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. But unlike Mr. Trump, Mr. Obama \u201cwas terribly consistent \u2014 he said from the beginning that he wanted to pull the U.S. troops out of Iraq.\u201d Phillip Gordon, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and the Middle East coordinator for the Obama White House, acknowledged that pulling back from the Middle East turned out to be easier said than done. But he said he had marveled that President Trump had managed to campaign promising both to pull back from Middle Eastern conflicts and at the same time to push back more aggressively against regional foes. \u201cYou can\u2019t do those two things at the same time,\u201d Mr. Gordon said, and in Mr. Trump\u2019s policies toward the conflicts in Syria and with Iran this fall \u201cthat enormous contradiction is coming back to haunt him.\u201d Critics say that the Trump administration has been inconsistent toward the Middle East before. When Persian Gulf neighbors sought to isolate Qatar in 2017, members of Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet urged them to end the dispute but the president himself applauded it. He later ordered airstrikes against Syria to punish its government for using chemical weapons against rebel groups but he failed to respond after Washington confirmed another use of chemical weapons earlier this year. When a Libyan militia leader launched an attack on the country\u2019s internationally recognized government six months ago, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spoke out against it. President Trump, a few days later, announced that he had called the militia leader and commended his \u201congoing counterterrorism efforts.\u201d Mr. al-Rubaie, the former Iraqi national security adviser, said that two wars, billions of dollars in spending, and the expense of thousands of Americans lives should have made Iraq the \u201ccrown\u201d of United States policy on the Middle East. But Mr. Trump \u201cdoesn\u2019t see Iraq\u201d and instead focuses only on the degree of Iranian influence. The Iraqis \u201cfeel let down. They feel that these people have left them and left the country. They left them high and dry,\u201d he said. \u201cFor the Americans, their friends are disposable,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Americans, you look for them and they look for the closest exit. You turn around and you don\u2019t find them.\u201d",

            "content": " LOS ANGELES \u2014 With Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s announcement on Friday that she raised $24.6 million in the past three months, the fund-raising picture for the leading Democratic presidential contenders has come into focus: Ms. Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders are in strong position to fund their campaigns over the long haul. Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders, whose campaign announced raising $25.3 million in the third quarter, both brought in more money than they had in the previous quarter, while money totals were down for two of their top competitors, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. Ms. Warren\u2019s total also offers further evidence of her steady rise to the top of the pack in the Democratic primary race, where she now rivals Mr. Biden as a leading contender for the nomination. And while Mr. Sanders trails both of them in recent polls, he has a loyal following that has supported him with millions of small donations this year, ensuring that he is well positioned for a primary season that could stretch through next spring. More broadly, the fund-raising totals show the collective enthusiasm in the party for progressive candidates pushing messages of sweeping change. And they demonstrate the undeniable power of online donors in the primary. Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders have sworn off courting wealthy donors and holding elite fund-raising events, while Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg \u2014 who raised $15.2 million and $19.1 million in the quarter, according to their campaigns \u2014 both pursue money from big donors. The fund-raising hauls by Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren show that there is \u201cstrength and power to their ideas that they\u2019re putting forward, and people are engaged,\u201d said Karen Finney, a Democratic strategist who was a senior adviser for Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign. \u201cI think for anybody else in the race, you have to pay attention to that \u2014 that there is energy around some of these big ideas that represent bigger changes,\u201d she said. Mr. Biden\u2019s total did little to bolster his status in the race. Already under siege from President Trump and no longer enjoying a clear lead over the rest of the field in national polls, Mr. Biden saw his fund-raising drop roughly 30 percent from the previous quarter. Mr. Sanders exceeded Mr. Biden\u2019s total by about $10 million and Ms. Warren exceeded it by more than $9 million \u2014 an indicator of the gulf between Mr. Biden and his two progressive rivals in attracting grass-roots support. And for the second consecutive quarter, Mr. Biden, a two-term vice president who previously served in the Senate for 36 years, was bested by Mr. Buttigieg, the mayor of the fourth most populous city in the 17th most populous state. Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign said on Friday that it had received 943,000 donations in the third quarter from 509,000 donors, and more than 300,000 of those donors gave to her presidential campaign for the first time. The average donation was $26, and Ms. Warren ended the quarter with $25.7 million in cash on hand, according to her campaign. \u201cPlease take a moment to be proud of the movement you\u2019re helping build,\u201d Roger Lau, Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign manager, wrote in an email to supporters. \u201cClose your eyes and picture Wall Street bankers scowling into their catered breakfast,\u201d he suggested. Collecting small contributions from a vast group of donors comes with a huge long-term advantage: Those donors can keep giving again and again as the campaign goes on. That is not the case for wealthy donors writing $2,800 checks to candidates \u2014 the maximum an individual can give to a campaign for the primary race. Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders \u201care breaking these old political models in which rich donors can capture and control political parties,\u201d said Stephanie Taylor, a co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which is supporting Ms. Warren. \u201cThis is just a really revolutionary, seismic shift in American politics.\u201d Beating Mr. Sanders\u2019s total for the past three months would have given another jolt of momentum to Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign. Instead, Mr. Sanders\u2019s status as the top fund-raiser for the quarter provides a reminder of his sizable base of support, even as other indicators like polling are less favorable. In the long run, Mr. Sanders\u2019s slight financial edge over Ms. Warren in the quarter is unlikely to make a major difference in the perceptions of their candidacies. Mr. Sanders entered the race having already established an enormous network of donors during his 2016 presidential campaign, and he raised slightly less in the third quarter of 2019 than he did during the same time period in 2015. \u201cThe biggest takeaway is that Warren is on a roll,\u201d said Stephanie Cutter, a Democratic strategist and veteran of past presidential campaigns. \u201cShe\u2019s got wind at her back. It\u2019s evident in her polls, her fund-raising and the energy at her events.\u201d Among other candidates who have disclosed their fund-raising for the third quarter, Senator Kamala Harris raised $11.6 million, Andrew Yang raised more than $10 million and Senator Cory Booker raised more than $6 million, according to their campaigns. Presidential candidates must report their fund-raising for the quarter, which covered July through September, to the Federal Election Commission by Oct. 15. Ms. Warren struggled with fund-raising at the beginning of her campaign, but those struggles ended up being short-lived. Her third-quarter haul is another validation of her strategy to rely on online donors to finance her campaign. That choice is central to her bid for the presidency, freeing up her schedule and creating a tidy contrast with some of her rivals: While other candidates gather with rich donors, Ms. Warren spends hours taking pictures with voters who wait in the \u201cselfie line\u201d at her town-hall-style events. \u201cI made the decision early on I was not going to spend my time behind closed doors with corporate executives and bazillionaires,\u201d Ms. Warren told the crowd at a town hall in Carson City, Nev., on Wednesday night. \u201cI was going to spend my time here.\u201d At a town hall in San Diego on Thursday night, she reached her latest selfie-related milestone: She has now taken pictures with an estimated 70,000 people since beginning her campaign. She made it to the end of the selfie line just before midnight.",

            "content": "  He tends to meander and misspeak. She once won a college debate scholarship. He is a relative centrist who is seen by Democrats in early polls as the strongest candidate against President Trump. She is a self-styled progressive fighter whose ability to appeal to the broad electorate in a general election still worries some voters and party officials. He rarely delves deep into policy on the campaign trail, preferring to discuss American values and the dangers of a second Trump administration. She gleefully ticks through her long list of detailed plans. In style, substance and strategies for winning the White House, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Elizabeth Warren present two starkly different options for Democratic voters, and in many ways they embody competing theories about what the Democratic Party should stand for. Those tensions will be laid bare Thursday night in Houston, when the two candidates meet onstage at a debate for the first time in the presidential race. It\u2019s a highly anticipated matchup between the early front-runner, Mr. Biden, and a liberal standard-bearer, Ms. Warren, who has steadily climbed in the polls to challenge him. Mr. Biden is eager to stress his experience. And his advisers and allies suggested in interviews that, whether obliquely or overtly, he is prepared to seize on one of Ms. Warren\u2019s perceived strengths \u2014 her extensive and boldly progressive policy plans \u2014 and use that to accentuate his own record of liberal achievements despite the sometimes-challenging political realities in Washington. \u201cYou have to have plans, but you have to be able to execute those plans,\u201d he said at a fund-raiser last week in Manhattan, a message he is expected to reiterate. Ms. Warren is unlikely to pursue the kind of personal, premeditated broadside that Senator Kamala Harris launched against Mr. Biden in the first debate. But she has emerged onstage as a skilled advocate for her message of \u201cbig, structural change\u201d and has shown that she is capable of crisply defending her far-reaching proposals. \u201cWe start with a plan, and then we get out there and fight for it,\u201d she told reporters in Austin, Tex., on Tuesday when she was asked about Mr. Biden\u2019s focus on what progressive proposals are achievable. \u201cTo me, that\u2019s what being president is all about. It\u2019s about laying those plans out and showing the direction for this country, and then getting in the fight, leading the fight and bringing people along.\u201d At Thursday\u2019s debate, Ms. Warren will have another opportunity to stress the urgency of fixing what she views as an economic and political system that caters to the rich and powerful at the expense of working people. Mr. Biden, a Beltway veteran, is expected to preach pragmatism, with a focus on how to achieve Democratic priorities in a divided political moment. [Which Democrats are leading the 2020 presidential race this week?] One risk for Mr. Biden is that, while he connects well with voters in one-on-one interactions, he is prone to uneven and sometimes faltering performances onstage. And the debate arrives as he has faced scrutiny for a series of gaffes and misstatements. \u201cVice President Biden has not proven to be really great on his feet,\u201d said Steve Drahozal, chairman of the Dubuque County Democratic Party in Iowa. \u201cI know he does not think that his gaffes are a big deal, but he is going up against a very keen, intelligent, articulate candidate who is able to frame issues very well.\u201d A strong night for Ms. Warren could further propel her already-accelerating campaign both nationally and especially in Iowa, the state that begins the presidential primary process, where Mr. Biden already faces challenges. \u201cShe\u2019s been the one who\u2019s been gaining the most,\u201d Mr. Drahozal said. \u201cWith Biden being in the front-runner position, I don\u2019t think he has a lot to gain. He has a lot to lose.\u201d Mr. Biden\u2019s team has no illusions about Ms. Warren\u2019s skill as a debater and her rise in the polls, advisers and others close to the campaign acknowledge, though they insist that they are not focusing on her alone. Mr. Biden spent the first two debates facing intense criticism from his opponents, a reflection in part of his current standing atop the polls, and his campaign is bracing for more broadsides from all across the stage. Allies noted that Mr. Biden has survived rough debate performances before, with little lasting impact on his national poll numbers. That, they argue, is evidence of the deep-seated good will that Mr. Biden, President Barack Obama\u2019s vice president, continues to enjoy from the Democratic base. [Sign up for our politics newsletter and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race.] They also see several opportunities for him to draw contrasts that could work to his benefit. That list includes emphasizing his foreign policy credentials \u2014 as a former vice president and a former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \u2014 amid several prominent foreign policy-related controversies involving the Trump administration. His team is convinced that the Democratic electorate is far more moderate than some activists suggest, and welcomes a debate over issues like health care \u2014 Mr. Biden supports a public option but opposes eliminating private insurance, something Ms. Warren supports under \u201cMedicare for all\u201d \u2014 and which social programs should be offered for free. And allies are eager to deepen an argument Mr. Biden has been previewing: that it is not enough to have ambitious plans if those proposals cannot survive the political realities of Washington. \u201cLots of other candidates have great plans, they have good policy papers, many of them have, you know, talked about them on college campuses or in the Senate,\u201d said Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware. \u201cThe difference, I think, is that Joe has decades of actual experience getting things enacted in a bitterly divided and partisan Washington, and I think he can and should point to that.\u201d Ms. Warren did not face significant scrutiny from other leading contenders in the first two debates. Mr. Biden\u2019s allies are privately hopeful that she will be pressed on the details and practicalities of her proposals by several of the candidates onstage, as her formidable standing in the race now makes her a bigger target for attacks. Ms. Warren and Mr. Biden have clashed before, exchanging sharp words during a fight over the nation\u2019s bankruptcy laws, which culminated in the passage of a bill in 2005 that Mr. Biden supported and Ms. Warren opposed. In April, in response to a reporter\u2019s question on the day Mr. Biden entered the race, Ms. Warren took a swipe at him over the bankruptcy legislation they had disagreed about. But she has almost always refrained from overtly criticizing her rivals, and any kind of premeditated attack on Mr. Biden on the debate stage would be a significant departure from how Ms. Warren has approached the campaign so far. \u201cDifferent candidates have different imperatives in the debates, and there are some candidates that need to throw wild punches in order to get attention,\u201d said Adam Green, a founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which is backing Ms. Warren. \u201cFortunately, Elizabeth Warren is not in that camp.\u201d Still, Mr. Green said, \u201cJust because she doesn\u2019t throw a punch doesn\u2019t mean that she doesn\u2019t strongly show a contrast.\u201d Scott M. Stringer, the New York City comptroller, who endorsed Ms. Warren on Monday, said there was no need for Ms. Warren to confront Mr. Biden on the debate stage. \u201cI think she has to challenge the Democratic Party and say, we can be incremental or we can be big and bold,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if she can showcase big and bold, I don\u2019t think she has to look at Joe Biden. I think she has to look directly into the camera and speak to the American people and Democrats.\u201d Speaking to reporters on Saturday at the New Hampshire Democratic Party convention, Ms. Warren portrayed the debate as an opportunity to share her message with a large audience. She received a far more raucous reception at the convention than did Mr. Biden, who was the first presidential candidate to speak. But asked to compare her welcome to Mr. Biden\u2019s, she did not engage. \u201cAll I can do is stand up and talk about why I\u2019m running,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not here to criticize any other Democrat or anyone else\u2019s campaign.\u201d Still, veteran Democrats caution that for all of the momentum she has enjoyed lately, Ms. Warren still has work to do in assuaging concerns about whether her unapologetically progressive candidacy would resonate in general election battlegrounds. \u201cElizabeth probably needs to show that she is ready to take on Middle America, the center of our country,\u201d said Sylvia Larsen, the former New Hampshire Senate president, who also questioned whether Mr. Biden could excite younger voters. \u201cOur primaries push people into a more left position and so to get back to a center \u2014 Joe already holds the center. And so, can Elizabeth Warren move back to the center if she\u2019s our nominee?\u201d Ms. Warren, for her part, has challenged the idea that a more moderate candidate is best positioned to win. At the convention Saturday, she told the crowd that \u201cwe can\u2019t choose a candidate we don\u2019t believe in because we\u2019re scared.\u201d And at a house party in New Hampshire on Labor Day, she cautioned against \u201cnibbling around the edges\u201d \u2014 without mentioning Mr. Biden by name. \u201cI think what\u2019s going to carry us as Democrats is not playing it safe,\u201d she said.",

            "content": "  WASHINGTON \u2014 Elizabeth Warren is playing a game of dare with Facebook. The Democratic presidential candidate bought a political ad on the social network this past week that purposefully includes false claims about Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, and President Trump to goad the social network to remove misinformation in political ads ahead of the 2020 presidential election. The ad, placed widely on Facebook beginning on Thursday, starts with Ms. Warren announcing \u201cBreaking news.\u201d The ad then goes on to say that Facebook and Mr. Zuckerberg are backing the re-election of Trump. Neither Mr. Zuckerberg nor the Silicon Valley company has announced their support of a candidate. [Related: What the 2020 candidates\u2019 spending on Facebook political ads reveals about their campaigns.] \u201cYou\u2019re probably shocked, and you might be thinking, \u2018how could this possibly be true?\u2019 Well, it\u2019s not,\u201d Ms. Warren said in the ad. In a series of tweets on Saturday, Ms. Warren, a senator from Massachusetts, said she had deliberately made an ad with lies because Facebook had previously allowed politicians to place ads with false claims. \u201cWe decided to see just how far it goes,\u201d Ms. Warren wrote, calling Facebook a \u201cdisinformation-for-profit machine\u201d and adding that Mr. Zuckerberg should be held accountable. Ms. Warren\u2019s actions follow a brouhaha over Facebook and political ads in recent weeks. Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign recently bought ads across social media that accused another Democratic presidential candidate, Joseph R. Biden Jr., of corruption in Ukraine. That ad, viewed more than five million times on Facebook, falsely said that Mr. Biden offered $1 billion to Ukrainian officials to remove a prosecutor who was overseeing an investigation of a company associated with Mr. Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden. This past week, the Biden campaign demanded that Facebook, Twitter and YouTube take down the ad. Facebook refused, telling the Biden campaign that it would keep the Trump ad up because of its belief that statements by politicians add to important discourse and are newsworthy, even if they are false. Twitter and YouTube have also kept the ad online. Ms. Warren\u2019s false ad on Facebook is now set to escalate her growing feud with the world\u2019s biggest social network. Ms. Warren has turned into a vocal critic of tech companies and their power. She has called for behemoths like Facebook and Google to be broken up. In a leaked audio recording published this month of a meeting that Mr. Zuckerberg had with Facebook employees, he was heard saying that Facebook would sue if Ms. Warren were to enact the breakup plan as president. In response, Ms. Warren doubled down, saying that America needed to \u201cfix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights, and repeatedly fumble their responsibility to protect our democracy.\u201d This month, Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign also sent an email seeking donations with the subject line \u201cre: Mark Zuckerberg.\u201d And at a rally in San Diego, as she talked about the power of huge corporations, she told the crowd, \u201cBreak them up. And yes, Mark Zuckerberg, I\u2019m looking at you.\u201d For Facebook, the situation is tricky. The social media company has struggled in recent years with what to allow and disallow on its site, especially after revelations that Russian operatives used the platform during the 2016 presidential election to post disinformation to inflame the American electorate. Facebook has moved to clamp down on false content. Yet when the company removes or buries messages, ads, photos and videos, it is often called out for bias and censorship. Facebook has faced particular wrath from conservatives, who have said the social network intentionally suppresses what they say. \u201cFacebook believes political speech should be protected,\u201d a spokesman for Facebook said on Saturday. \u201cIf Senator Warren wants to say things she knows to be untrue, we believe Facebook should not be in the position of censoring that speech.\u201d Truth in social media advertising is likely to become a bigger issue ahead of the 2020 presidential election. Mr. Zuckerberg is scheduled to speak about Facebook\u2019s political speech policies this coming week at Georgetown University. Presidential candidates have been spending huge sums on ads on Facebook and other social media platforms to reach voters. Some campaigns have focused on advertising specifically on Facebook given its sheer size \u2014 it has more than 2.2 billion users worldwide \u2014 and the ability to spread ads and content cheaply and quickly across the platform. Like her rivals for the Democratic nomination, Ms. Warren has spent a significant amount of money on Facebook advertising, which is a crucial way to reach potential grass-roots donors. Over all, her presidential campaign has spent more than $3.3 million on Facebook ads, according to numbers disclosed by the company. Unlike the social media companies, some cable outlets have refused to run the false Trump campaign ad that said Mr. Biden acted corruptly in Ukraine. CNN and NBCU, which declined to run the ad, said it violated their standards. Some broadcast networks across the nation have run the ad, including in early voting states. Late on Saturday, Facebook tweeted a response to Ms. Warren. The company said that broadcast stations had aired the Trump ad about 1,000 times as required by law and that the Federal Communications Commission didn\u2019t want broadcast companies censoring speech. \u201cWe agree it\u2019s better to let voters \u2014 not companies \u2014 decide,\u201d Facebook said.",

            "author": "Shane Goldmacher",
            "content": " As Senator Elizabeth Warren has surged toward the top of the Democratic presidential field, she has found herself torn between two competing imperatives: maintaining her perceived purity from the influence of wealthy contributors and not ceding any financial advantage to President Trump, who is busy breaking fund-raising records. One of the centerpieces of Ms. Warren\u2019s anti-corruption message has been her pledge to forgo traditional big-money fund-raisers, which advisers believe has helped fuel her rise. From the start, Ms. Warren had said the ban only applied to the primary. \u201cI do not believe in unilateral disarmament,\u201d she said when she announced it in February on MSNBC. But in a reversal, she told CBS News in an interview posted late Tuesday evening that she would extend the pledge through the general election if she were to win the Democratic nomination. \u201cLook, for me this is pretty straightforward,\u201d Ms. Warren said. \u201cEither you think democracy works and electing a president is all about going behind closed doors with bazillionaires and corporate executives and lobbyists and scooping up as much money as possible. Or you think it\u2019s about a grass-roots, let\u2019s build this from the ground up.\u201d Pressed on whether that was her position \u201cno matter how much money Donald Trump is raising,\u201d Ms. Warren replied: \u201cYeah, I\u2019m not going to do the big-dollar fund-raisers. I\u2019m just not going to do it. The whole notion behind this campaign is that we can build this together.\u201d Her aides confirmed the decision on Wednesday but layered on some caveats: While she would forgo fund-raisers for her campaign, she would headline open press events for the Democratic National Committee, which has traditionally served as a virtual extension of the nominee. Her spokeswoman, Kristen Orthman, said Ms. Warren was committed to helping Democrats \u201cup and down the ballot.\u201d Powered by small donors, Ms. Warren has become one of the strongest Democratic fund-raisers of the 2020 field, raising $24.6 million in the last three months from more than 940,000 donations, second only to Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who raised $25.3 million. Ms. Warren\u2019s new position on general election fund-raisers appears to be an effort to thread the needle between those on the progressive left urging her to permanently swear off soliciting big checks and Democratic officials and activists concerned that such a stand would endanger the party as Mr. Trump and the Republicans bank record sums of cash. Veterans of Democratic politics said the idea that fund-raising operations for the party nominee and the party itself would be completely independent was strained. \u201cOnce you are the Democratic nominee, you are the party,\u201d said Rufus Gifford, a former finance director for President Barack Obama, who has donated to multiple 2020 candidates but not to Ms. Warren. \u201cYou own the party. Your political operation takes over the D.N.C. You cannot divorce in any way fund-raising for the presidential campaign and the Democratic Party.\u201d The donation limits for the D.N.C. are actually far higher than those for direct contributions to campaigns. The D.N.C. can raise money in increments of $355,000; direct donations to a potential Warren general election committee would be limited to $2,800. Ms. Orthman said Ms. Warren would attend D.N.C. events that are open to the press to \u201cmake sure the Democratic National Committee, state and local parties, and Democratic candidates everywhere have the resources\u201d they need. She also said Ms. Warren was \u201cnot going to change a thing in how she runs her campaign,\u201d including \u201cno special access or call time with rich donors or big-dollar fund-raisers.\u201d Ms. Warren headlined a D.N.C. event in August, but she did not meet privately with large donors who attended. She is scheduled for another D.N.C. event next week. The Warren campaign declined to say whether it would create a joint fund-raising committee with the D.N.C., which is traditionally a big lure for contributors who want to support candidates up and down the ballot. Mr. Trump and his shared committees with the Republican National Committee raised $125 million in the last three months. Henry R. Munoz III, who stepped down as finance chair of the D.N.C. earlier this year and has co-hosted a fund-raiser for former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., said Ms. Warren\u2019s proposed arrangement left him confused. \u201cI don\u2019t even know how that would work,\u201d Mr. Munoz said. Democrats, he added, \u201chave to do everything in their power to work together to create an infrastructure to do battle with the almost unlimited resources that this administration and that party will use to destroy what we believe in.\u201d Beyond the party itself, an array of Democratic super PACs are gearing up for 2020. Guy Cecil, the chairman of the biggest such group in the presidential race, Priorities USA, wrote on Twitter that regardless of Ms. Warren\u2019s decision, it was \u201cfull speed ahead.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re already up & running ads holding Trump accountable in key states & will be through November next year,\u201d Mr. Cecil wrote. Ms. Warren has steadily risen in the polls throughout the year and has recently topped Mr. Biden in some surveys both nationally and in the early-voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire. Previously, she had been clear that her ban on fund-raisers applied only to the primary. MSNBC\u2019s Chris Hayes asked her that directly when she announced it (\u201cYes,\u201d Ms. Warren replied). And in an interview with The New York Times over the summer, Ms. Warren said, \u201cIt\u2019s primaries. This is Democrat against Democrat. I don\u2019t believe in unilateral disarmament.\u201d Some of her rivals had sought to portray her stance as inconsistent. \u201cBernie is proud to be the only candidate running to defeat Donald Trump who is 100 percent funded by grass-roots donations \u2014 both in the primary and in the general,\u201d Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, said pointedly when announcing his campaign\u2019s quarterly financial haul. There has also been grumbling about the $10 million in leftover Senate funds she seeded her presidential campaign with, some of which was raised from major contributors. Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders are the only two Democrats to skip traditional fund-raising events in the primary, where candidates can collect checks of up to $2,800. Her announcement this week could appeal to more fervent supporters of Mr. Sanders, whose base Ms. Warren has been seeking to win over. Tension over how candidates raise their money is an age-old political issue. In the 2016 race, Mr. Trump railed against the influence of big donors in the Republican primary. But once he became the nominee, he quickly embraced the donor world. At the time, he said he did not see a contradiction. \u201cNo,\u201d Mr. Trump said then, \u201cbecause I\u2019m raising money for the party.\u201d",

            "author": "Astead W. Herndon",
            "content": " The Working Families Party, the labor-aligned progressive group whose electoral influence has grown since the 2016 election, has endorsed Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts for the Democratic presidential nomination, a boon to her candidacy as she attempts to position herself as the main challenger to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. The party endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont during the last presidential cycle, at which time he described Working Families as \u201cthe closest thing\u201d to \u201cmy vision of democratic socialism.\u201d The group\u2019s endorsement of Ms. Warren on Monday, one of the few by a prominent progressive organization this early in the primary, could turn heads among left-leaning Democrats desperate to defeat Mr. Biden, the more moderate front-runner, in a primary election where their party\u2019s ideological future is at stake. \u201cSenator Warren knows how to kick Wall Street kleptocrats where it hurts, and she\u2019s got some truly visionary plans to make this country work for the many,\u201d said Maurice Mitchell, the Working Families Party\u2019s national director. \u201cWe need a mass movement to make her plans a reality, and we\u2019re going to be a part of that work.\u201d Mr. Mitchell brushed off the possibility that the group\u2019s endorsement would be seen as a sign of a splintering of the progressive left. The vote among \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of party members and national committee leaders resulted in a commanding majority for Ms. Warren, a party spokesman said; she received more than 60 percent of the votes on the first ballot. But the announcement was met with derision from some of Mr. Sanders\u2019s supporters. The national committee leaders \u2014 56 people \u2014 held 50 percent of the voting power, with party members accounting for the other 50 percent. Several Sanders supporters called for the Working Families Party to release the full vote totals, which it has declined to do. Mr. Sanders\u2019s campaign shook up its New Hampshire staff over the weekend as Ms. Warren continued to make inroads among progressives. Ms. Warren is coming off a debate performance last week that was generally well received, and she held a rally in New York on Monday that drew thousands to Washington Square Park. Also on Monday, Ms. Warren unveiled a plan to combat corruption in government, a core theme of her campaign. The plan is based on a wide-ranging anticorruption bill that she first proposed last year and is a cornerstone of her stump speech on the campaign trail. Mr. Mitchell and other Working Families Party leaders said in interviews that their endorsement came with a message to other progressive organizations. Rather than passively observe the primary, they said, these groups should choose a side and flex their organizing muscle during the early stages to help knock Mr. Biden off his perch. \u201cIf our focus is on victory, we can\u2019t be delusional about it,\u201d Mr. Mitchell said. \u201cYou don\u2019t defeat the moderate wing of Democrats through thought pieces or pithy tweets, you defeat their politics through organizing.\u201d Traditional bellwether endorsements from labor unions like American Federation of Teachers and the Service Employees International Union have not yet materialized, though Mr. Sanders picked up an endorsement from the United Electrical workers in August. With less than five months to go before the Iowa caucuses formally begin the nominating contest, many organizations are still wrestling with a sprawling Democratic field. \u201cThere are some great arguments for progressives rallying around a single candidate as soon as possible and others for taking the time to see how the contest develops,\u201d said Yvette Simpson, chief executive of Democracy for America, another progressive group that endorsed Mr. Sanders four years ago. Ms. Simpson said her group did not plan to endorse a candidate before December. Mr. Sanders finished second in the Working Families Party vote, ahead of three other candidates: the former housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey and Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York. Most national polls show a top tier of three candidates in the Democratic primary \u2014 Mr. Biden, Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders \u2014 and Mr. Biden has remained the front-runner. Among the two leading progressive candidates, Mr. Sanders has traditionally enjoyed more support from working-class voters, helped by his name recognition held over from 2016. Ms. Warren has made significant gains in the last six months, but polling shows that most of that growth has come from college-educated voters. In the years since President Trump\u2019s election, candidates backed by the Working Families Party have won congressional, state and local races across the country, expanding the group\u2019s power base from the Acela corridor to the West Coast. The group also helped several left-wing candidates win seats in the New York State Legislature last year. Mr. Mitchell took over as national director for the party in 2018, after he rose in prominence during the Black Lives Matter movement born out of protests in Ferguson, Mo. The group\u2019s leaders stressed that, even with their endorsement, their intention was not to divide the progressive left between Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders. The senators are longtime friends and have been publicly supportive of each other\u2019s candidacies. But they are still locked in a battle to be the progressive standard-bearer. After the Working Families endorsement was announced on Monday, Misty Rebik, Mr. Sanders\u2019s Iowa state director, wrote on Twitter: \u201cThere is one movement politics presidential candidate. One. It\u2019s @BernieSanders.\u201d Outside the left wing of the party, more moderate Democrats have continued to sound alarms about progressives\u2019 ability to beat Mr. Trump, and about Ms. Warren\u2019s chances in particular. And many Republicans see the progressives\u2019 embrace of a \u201cMedicare for all\u201d health care system and the Green New Deal as general-election liabilities waiting to be exploited. Surrogates for other Democratic contenders \u2014 like Mr. Biden, Ms. Harris and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. \u2014 have tried to paint Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders as candidates of the elite, who talk about lofty ideologies instead of pragmatic solutions. \u201cMy concern about the vision from the Sanders-Warren approach is that it can polarize Americans, when we have other ways to deliver bold solutions without dividing the American people further,\u201d Mr. Buttigieg said Sunday on CNN. But Mr. Mitchell said he believed the Working Families Party could convert Democrats skeptical of wide-reaching progressive policies. \u201cI\u2019m not worried about converting people who are already committed to a structural change agenda,\u201d Mr. Mitchell said. \u201cI\u2019m worried about the people who are still trying to figure out where they land.\u201d",

            "author": "Thomas Kaplan",
            "content": " Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts brought her ascendant presidential campaign to New York City on Monday night, unspooling a forceful argument for attacking corruption in government in a defining speech of her White House bid. Addressing thousands of supporters in Washington Square Park, some holding up \u201cI\u2019m a Warren Democrat\u201d signs, Ms. Warren pressed her case to bring sweeping change to an economic and political system she views as fundamentally tilted to favor the wealthy and powerful. She spoke near the site of the Triangle shirtwaist factory fire of 1911, which killed 146 garment workers, most of them women. The fire spurred a push to improve workplace safety, which Ms. Warren harnessed as a parallel for the far-reaching change she wants to pursue as president. And once again, she urged Democrats to embrace her call for dramatic change \u2014 not the kind of incremental approach favored most notably by Joseph R. Biden Jr., the former vice president and the primary race\u2019s front-runner. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot at stake in this election, and I know people are scared,\u201d Ms. Warren said from a lectern in front of the park\u2019s marble arch. \u201cBut we can\u2019t choose a candidate we don\u2019t believe in just because we\u2019re too scared to do anything else. And Democrats can\u2019t win if we\u2019re scared and looking backward.\u201d Ms. Warren was introduced by Maurice Mitchell, the national director of the Working Families Party, which announced its endorsement of her earlier Monday. In her speech, Ms. Warren described President Trump as \u201ccorruption in the flesh,\u201d but added that \u201cour problems didn\u2019t start with Donald Trump.\u201d And in invoking the Triangle factory workers, she made explicit reference to the power of women to bring about change. \u201cWe\u2019re not here today because of famous arches or famous men,\u201d Ms. Warren told the crowd. \u201cIn fact, we\u2019re not here because of men at all. We\u2019re here because of some hard-working women.\u201d Throughout her remarks, Ms. Warren was repeatedly met with enthusiastic cheers, and the crowd broke into chants of \u201ctwo cents\u201d when Ms. Warren brought up her proposal to impose a 2 percent annual tax on the fortunes of the super rich. Beyond amplifying her call to confront corruption, a hallmark of her presidential bid, the speech was another chance for Ms. Warren to draw a big crowd on the campaign trail and put on display the enthusiasm she is generating among voters. In August, she drew 15,000 people in Seattle and 12,000 in St. Paul, according to her campaign. The New York City Department of Parks and Recreation said organizers had anticipated a crowd of 8,000 to 10,000 people for Monday\u2019s speech. Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign said the crowd exceeded 20,000, though that estimate could not be independently verified. With each big rally, Ms. Warren is solidifying her place in an exclusive club of presidential candidates who have become crowd magnets, exhilarating fans at events that can sometimes feel like rock concerts. In the 2004 election, it was Howard Dean, the former governor of Vermont, whose large crowds \u2014 including a big showing in Bryant Park in New York in August 2003 \u2014 offered a visibly striking signal of interest in his candidacy. Barack Obama drew enormous crowds in the 2008 race, including at a giant rally in Washington Square Park in September 2007. And in the 2016 election, Mr. Trump and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont were both buoyed by the electric crowds they commanded. Mr. Sanders, too, held a huge event in Washington Square Park, drawing a crowd before the 2016 New York primary that his campaign put at 27,000 people, though he went on to lose that contest to Hillary Clinton. Mr. Sanders has drawn big crowds this year as well. The recent history of crowd-magnet candidates offers a mixed track record of electoral success. Joe Trippi, who was Mr. Dean\u2019s campaign manager, said Ms. Warren was well positioned to draw sizable crowds in big cities, given her large email list and many grass-roots donors around the country. That is particularly true in a Democratic stronghold like New York; for example, through the end of June, Ms. Warren had an estimated 1,300 donors in a single ZIP code in Brooklyn that includes most of Park Slope. But Mr. Trippi cautioned that drawing a large audience in a big city does not necessarily translate to success in the early voting states. \u201cThe question is, can you build beyond that core into a more diverse Democratic constituency?\u201d Mr. Trippi asked. \u201cFifteen thousand people in Seattle does not equal winning South Carolina.\u201d Asked last week whether she thought crowd size mattered, Ms. Warren replied, \u201cI think it matters getting to talk to lots and lots and lots and lots of people.\u201d Earlier Monday, Ms. Warren unveiled an expansive plan to attack corruption in government, a central theme of her campaign. The plan is based on a wide-ranging anticorruption package she first proposed last year. On the campaign trail, she likes to call it \u201cthe biggest anticorruption plan since Watergate.\u201d Ms. Warren kicked off her campaign with a speech in Lawrence, Mass., at the Everett Mills, where textile workers went on strike in 1912. On Monday, she again invoked the setting of her speech, recalling the horrific scene of the Triangle shirtwaist factory fire. Before the fire, she said, female factory workers across New York City had been \u201csounding the alarm\u201d about their working conditions, but were no match for wealthy and well-connected factory owners. \u201cThe tragic story of the Triangle factory fire is a story about power,\u201d Ms. Warren said. \u201cA story of what happens when the rich and the powerful take control of government and use it to increase their own profits while they stick it to working people. But what happened in the aftermath of the fire is a different story about power \u2014 a story about our power, a story about what\u2019s possible when we fight together as one.\u201d Ms. Warren told the story of Frances Perkins, citing her efforts after the Triangle factory fire to improve conditions for workers, and, later, her tenure as labor secretary for Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Ms. Warren presented Ms. Perkins \u2014 \u201cone very persistent woman,\u201d she called her, drawing cheers \u2014 as a template of sorts for how a President Warren could bring about change. \u201cShe used the same model that she and her friends had used after the Triangle fire: She worked the political system relentlessly from the inside while a sustained movement applied pressure from the outside,\u201d Ms. Warren said, citing legacies like Social Security and the minimum wage. Even the lectern from which Ms. Warren delivered those lines had a connection to Ms. Perkins, who was the first female cabinet member: It was made with reclaimed wood from the Frances Perkins Homestead in Maine, her campaign said. As is her custom, Ms. Warren stayed after her speech to take pictures with anyone who wanted one. Linus Glenhaber, 18, a college student from Massachusetts, worked on his science homework as he waited. He praised Ms. Warren for how she reached back into American history as she spoke of corruption. \u201cWhen she was talking about the Triangle shirtwaist factory,\u201d he said, \u201cit felt relevant to today in this incredible way.\u201d Ms. Warren finished taking pictures around 11:40 p.m. \u2014 nearly four hours after she finished her speech. One figure who did not seem to factor into Monday\u2019s proceedings was New York City\u2019s mayor, Bill de Blasio, who like Ms. Warren is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination. \u201cThe mayor of this city is still running, and Elizabeth Warren turned this city out,\u201d said City Councilman Jimmy Van Bramer of Queens, who endorsed Ms. Warren last week. \u201cI\u2019m not being mean, but it\u2019s got to be devastating for him. But it\u2019s great for us.\u201d",

            "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 It is one of Elizabeth Warren\u2019s signature anecdotes in her stump speech: By the end of her first year as a public-school teacher, she was \u201cvisibly pregnant,\u201d and the principal wished her luck and hired another teacher to replace her. In recent days, a conservative news site and other outlets have cited evidence that challenges her account, including past remarks by Ms. Warren in which she did not mention being forced to leave the school and minutes from a school board meeting showing that her contract was initially extended for the next school year. Ms. Warren is now pushing back against any suggestion that she has misrepresented the circumstances of her departure, and pointing to the discrimination that many pregnant women have faced on the job. The school board did extend her contract early in her pregnancy, before the school knew about it, she said in an interview with CBS News. But two months later, when it was clear that she was pregnant, she lost the job. \u201cWhen I was 22 and finishing my first year of teaching, I had an experience millions of women will recognize,\u201d she wrote on Twitter. \u201cBy June I was visibly pregnant \u2014 and the principal told me the job I\u2019d already been promised for the next year would go to someone else.\u201d She added: \u201cThis was 1971, years before Congress outlawed pregnancy discrimination \u2014 but we know it still happens in subtle and not-so-subtle ways. We can fight back by telling our stories. I tell mine on the campaign trail, and I hope to hear yours.\u201d Ms. Warren did not name the principal in her tweets. News accounts show that the principal at the time was Edward Pruzinsky. He died in 1999. Ms. Warren has frequently cited her experience with pregnancy discrimination as she has laid out her political biography to voters, explaining why she went from a public-school teaching career into law and eventually politics, and how her professional development was affected by a form of workplace bias that many women encounter. Historically, it was common for American teachers to be pushed out of their jobs during pregnancy, either through termination or the requirement of an unpaid leave of absence. In 1974, the Supreme Court ruled some of these policies unconstitutional. But not all such policies were explicitly written down and tracked, giving many female teachers little legal recourse. CBS News quoted a retired teacher from Ms. Warren\u2019s school, Trudy Randall, who suggested Ms. Warren would have been unwelcome at the school given her pregnancy. \u201cThe rule was at five months you had to leave when you were pregnant. Now, if you didn\u2019t tell anybody you were pregnant, and they didn\u2019t know, you could fudge it and try to stay on a little bit longer,\u201d Ms. Randall was quoted as saying. \u201cBut they kind of wanted you out if you were pregnant.\u201d At issue are the circumstances that brought to an end Ms. Warren\u2019s brief career as a special needs teacher at an elementary school in Riverdale, N.J., where she worked from 1970 to 1971, when she was just out of college. On the campaign trail, Ms. Warren\u2019s personal story is a central part of her stump speech, beginning with her upbringing in Oklahoma and, eventually, her experience as a teacher. As Ms. Warren tells it, she had wanted to be a teacher since she was in second grade. \u201cI loved that work, and I would probably still be doing that work today, but my story has some more turns,\u201d she told a crowd in Nevada last week. \u201cBy the end of the first year, I was visibly pregnant, and the principal did what principals did in those days: wished me luck and hired someone else for the job.\u201d She included a similar account in her 2014 memoir. In some retellings earlier this year, she said the principal \u201cshowed me the door.\u201d In a post on Twitter last week, Meagan Day, a writer for the socialist magazine Jacobin, drew attention to an interview Ms. Warren gave in 2007 in which she discussed the end of her career as a public-school teacher and did not describe being forced out because she was pregnant. Ms. Warren recalled going back to school because she lacked the education courses she needed. \u201cI went back to graduate school and took a couple of courses in education and said, \u2018I don\u2019t think this is going to work out for me,\u2019\u201d Ms. Warren said in the interview. Addressing the differences in her accounts, Ms. Warren said in a statement to CBS News, \u201cAfter becoming a public figure I opened up more about different pieces in my life and this was one of them.\u201d On Monday, a conservative website, The Washington Free Beacon, published minutes from meetings of the Riverdale Board of Education that referred to her employment status. Minutes of a meeting on April 21, 1971, show that the board approved the issuance of a contract for Ms. Warren\u2019s second year. \u201cMrs. Elizabeth Warren \u2014 2 days per week, Speech,\u201d the minutes say. Ms. Warren told CBS News that she had been hiding her pregnancy. \u201cI was pregnant, but nobody knew it,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then a couple of months later when I was six months pregnant and it was pretty obvious, the principal called me in, wished me luck and said he was going to hire someone else for the job.\u201d Minutes of another school board meeting on June 16, 1971, say that Ms. Warren\u2019s resignation, effective June 30, \u201cwas accepted with regret.\u201d Ms. Warren\u2019s first child, Amelia, was born that September. The Republican National Committee said Tuesday that Ms. Warren had been \u201ccaught lying.\u201d Pregnancy discrimination can begin as soon as women reveal they are pregnant, or are visibly showing, and can continue to affect them for years. In physically demanding jobs, pregnant women risk being fired if they ask to take rest breaks, and in the corporate world, women and mothers may be steered away from prestigious assignments or excluded from client meetings if a boss perceives them to be less committed to their work than other employees. Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, wrote on Twitter about Ms. Warren\u2019s experience, \u201cThis happened to women ALL the time.\u201d Congress passed the Pregnancy Discrimination Act in 1978, which made it illegal to treat pregnant women differently from other people \u201csimilar in their ability or inability to work.\u201d But the law did not solve the problem. Employers argued successfully in court that pregnant workers were comparable to people who got injured off the job, and did not deserve to be accommodated. Although many American companies have made efforts to become more welcoming to women and retain mothers, pregnancy discrimination remains widespread. Joan C. Williams, the founding director of the Center for WorkLife Law at the University of California Hastings College of the Law, called it the \u201cstrongest form of gender discrimination there is.\u201d",

            "content": " Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts fired her national organizing director after \u201cmultiple complaints regarding inappropriate behavior,\u201d according to a statement released Friday by her communications director. The campaign hired the staff member, Richard McDaniel, earlier this year to head the national field operations, a job that involved spearheading the campaign\u2019s organizing structure and outreach programs. The statement by Ms. Warren\u2019s communications director, Kristen Orthman, said senior campaign leadership had received multiple complaints about Mr. McDaniel\u2019s behavior \u201cover the past two weeks.\u201d The decision to fire him came after an investigation conducted by outside counsel. \u201cBased on the results of the investigation, the campaign determined that his reported conduct was inconsistent with its values and that he could not be a part of the campaign moving forward,\u201d Ms. Orthman said. Ms. Orthman declined to elaborate on the nature of the complaints. Politico was first to report that Mr. McDaniel had been dismissed. The news came the same day that the Warren campaign reported having raised $24.6 million in the most recent fund-raising quarter, a total that offered further evidence of Ms. Warren\u2019s steady rise to the top of the Democratic primary field. Mr. McDaniel was a veteran of several Democratic campaigns, most recently serving as a senior campaign aide to Senator Doug Jones, who defeated a Republican challenger in a closely watched special election in Alabama in 2017. Before that, he worked for Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign. Reached by phone, Mr. McDaniel said \u201cdeparting at this time is in the best interest of both parties.\u201d \u201cI would never intentionally engage in any behavior inconsistent with the campaign or my own values,\u201d he said. \u201cIf others feel that I have, I understand it is important to listen even when you disagree. I wish the campaign and my colleagues well.\u201d Ms. Warren, speaking to reporters on Friday in Los Angeles after the firing was announced, said that when she started in campaign, she put in place procedures to deal with any complaints, and that process was followed in this case. \u201cIt is really hard for anyone to come forward with a complaint or with a concern, and the people who did that showed incredible courage,\u201d she said. When he was hired, Mr. McDaniel's expertise in galvanizing black voters was touted as a boon to Ms. Warren, whose populist brand has so far held more sway in white elite circles than black ones. According to sources familiar with the campaign, there had been discontent with Mr. McDaniel\u2019s job performance even before the complaints regarding his behavior arose.",

            "content": " Good morning.  On Tuesday, months after Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts first unveiled her proposal to break up Facebook and other tech giants, The Verge published highlights from two hours of leaked audio in which Mark Zuckerberg railed against Facebook critics, competitors and Ms. Warren. Our political correspondent Matt Stevens covered Ms. Warren\u2019s response to the remarks: Remember that giant billboard near the Caltrain station in San Francisco? The one with Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s face on it? The one that said in all capital letters: \u201cBREAK UP BIG TECH\u201d? With Ms. Warren seeking the Democratic nomination for president, her campaign put up that billboard over the summer after she rolled out her plans to regulate the tech industry. One needs only to look to the billboard for evidence that she wanted to make very sure tech workers got her message. On Tuesday we learned that, yes, in fact, they did get the memo \u2014 and that at least one of Silicon Valley\u2019s power players is not a fan. \u201cIf she gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge,\u201d Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, said of Ms. Warren and her plan, according to leaked recordings of comments he made to Facebook employees. \u201cDoes that still suck for us? Yeah. I mean, I don\u2019t want to have a major lawsuit against our own government. That\u2019s not like the position you want to be in. We care about our country and want to work with our government to do good things,\u201d he added. \u201cBut look, at the end of the day, if someone\u2019s going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight.\u201d Ms. Warren has built her campaign around a call for \u201cbig, structural change\u201d and has garnered significant support by releasing a series of detailed policy proposals like the one on how she would break up giant tech companies. Shortly after The Verge published Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s remarks, Ms. Warren responded on Twitter. And she did not mince words. \u201cWhat would really \u2018suck,\u2019\u201d she said, mimicking Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s language, \u201cis if we don\u2019t fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights, and repeatedly fumble their responsibility to protect our democracy.\u201d The exchanges didn\u2019t end there. Mr. Zuckerberg commented on the situation later on Tuesday in a Facebook post, and Ms. Warren again took to Twitter, firing off a five-tweet thread that began: \u201cLet\u2019s talk a bit about my plan to #BreakUpBigTech and why it\u2019s got Mark Zuckerberg so worked up.\u201d The episode had the effect of publicly pitting one of the leading Democratic presidential candidates against the chief executive of the world\u2019s largest social network.

Her hair is pulled into pigtails, and she carries shopping bags and a cart full of her belongings. As she sings a Puccini aria, her stage is the Wilshire-Normandie Metro station in Los Angeles. A video posted on Thursday to the L.A.P.D.\u2019s Twitter account showed the homeless singer\u2019s performance. \u201c4 million people call LA home. 4 million stories. 4 million voices \u2026 sometimes you just have to stop and listen to one, to hear something beautiful,\u201d the post read. The video went viral, racking up more than 900,000 views. ABC7 identified the songstress as Emily Zamourka, 52, who said she learned to sing as a child growing up in Russia. She said she became homeless after her violin was stolen while she performed in downtown L.A. Hundreds of people have since donated to online fund-raisers to help Ms. Zamourka, The Washington Post reported. And Councilman Joe Buscaino invited her to perform at the unveiling of the city\u2019s new Little Italy district this weekend. \u201cI\u2019ve seen her for years on the Metro,\u201d one Twitter user wrote. \u201cI don\u2019t know why she\u2019s been homeless all these years, but she\u2019s a human being \u2026 that\u2019s all that matters.\u201d California Today goes live at 6:30 a.m. Pacific time weekdays.

            "author": "Jonathan Martin",
            "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 Senator Elizabeth Warren has built her following in part by taking pictures with thousands of voters deep into evening after campaign events, but her dinner audience here one night last month was far smaller. And Ms. Warren\u2019s guests were more interested in hearing, and politely challenging, her campaign pitch than eagerly capturing the moment for posterity on their iPhones. Addressing a few dozen members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus at a Chinese restaurant a few blocks from the Capitol, she laid out her case for why she could unify Democrats, emphasized that she was not hostile to properly run businesses and made a soft sell to the lawmakers to support her presidential bid. \u201cShe said, \u2018Nobody could do this alone, I will need your help,\u2019\u201d recalled Representative Chellie Pingree of Maine, who attended the gathering and said Ms. Warren \u201cwas great.\u201d But just under a month since the family-style meal, the Massachusetts senator has the same small number of endorsements from congressional colleagues beyond her home state as she did beforehand: three. Ms. Warren is expected to reveal additional support from Democratic officials this week in conjunction with Tuesday\u2019s CNN/New York Times debate and the release of her smashing third-quarter financial disclosure. Yet her growing crowd sizes, soaring fund-raising and surge to the top of a number of national and early-state polls only shine a brighter light on one of the most revealing elements of this primary: the widening gap between the preferences of many Democratic voters and the lawmakers who represent them. Ms. Warren is now a clear front-runner in the race for her party\u2019s nomination, yet just under four months before the leadoff Iowa caucuses she lacks the support of a single governor, big-city mayor or fellow senator outside Massachusetts. She does have the backing of the Working Families Party, an influential liberal group, and yet she also has fewer total endorsements from state legislators in Iowa and New Hampshire than Senator Cory Booker, who registers in the lower single-digits of surveys and last month had to beseech donors to give him enough money to sustain his stagnant campaign. The apparent lag between Democratic activists and Democratic elected officials, which comes nearly four years after President Trump\u2019s stunning outsider\u2019s capture of the Republican nomination and Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019 surprisingly potent candidacy in the Democratic primaries, has done little to slow Ms. Warren\u2019s momentum. Yet the reluctance of Democratic lawmakers to embrace Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign this deep into the year, after she has plainly emerged as a leading candidate, illustrates both the lingering reservations party elites have about her general election prospects and her unique positioning in this race. \u201cRacing to the left is not really speaking to the needs of people in the heartland,\u201d said Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, who expressed alarm about scrapping private health insurance, urged the candidates to focus on \u201cpocketbook issues\u201d and, when asked if Ms. Warren could reclaim the Midwestern states Mr. Trump captured in 2016, paused before saying: \u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d Ms. Warren is politically neither fish nor fowl. She is not an anti-establishment insurgent in the style of Mr. Sanders, who were he in the position Ms. Warren is now would almost certainly have inspired a Stop Bernie campaign funded by a petrified donor class. But with her refusal to raise money among rich contributors, her unabashed populism and her pre-Senate roots in academia, she is hardly a Clinton-style creature of the Democratic political class. As a result, many party officials are neither rushing to oppose her nor racing to her side, instead staying on the sidelines and doing what politicians often do when they are uncertain of what choice to make: buying time. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to wait, you keep your relationships good,\u201d said Representative Deb Haaland of New Mexico, one of the few lawmakers who is supporting Ms. Warren, noting that some of her colleagues are loath to offend their friends in the race by choosing a candidate. Reinforcing this instinct toward caution is the fluid nature of a primary still large enough to feature 12 candidates on the debate stage this week as well as the high stakes of next year\u2019s general election. \u201cYou had two candidates last time,\u201d said longtime Representative Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, referring to the Sanders-versus-Hillary Clinton race. \u201cPeople want to see this unfold.\u201d Thanks to his decades-long relationships and the perception in some quarters that he would be a strong candidate against Mr. Trump, Joseph R. Biden Jr. has picked up the most support from Democratic lawmakers of any of the presidential hopefuls. But his uneven performance as a candidate this year and Mr. Trump\u2019s daily barrage of attacks on him have left some party officials wondering just how safe a pick he is in 2020. \u201cPeople are concerned about Joe, but they ask: Is Elizabeth electable?\u201d said former Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, explaining the dilemma. \u201cSo a lot of people are just keeping their powder dry because they have not decided who can best run against Trump.\u201d Defeating a president who may be the first incumbent to seek re-election after being impeached should be the party\u2019s overriding focus, said Gov. J.B. Pritzker of Illinois. \u201cI genuinely feel our republic is in danger,\u201d Mr. Pritzker said. A longtime donor who often immersed himself in primaries before he entered politics, Mr. Pritzker said he was staying out of this race for the time being in part because he was still stung by 2016, when some of Mr. Sanders\u2019s supporters protested what they saw as his mistreatment by Mrs. Clinton and her establishment-aligned supporters. \u201cWhen he didn\u2019t win people folded their arms and stayed home or they voted for Jill Stein or Gary Johnson,\u201d said Mr. Pritzker, alluding to two of the third-party candidates whose votes helped cost Mrs. Clinton the election. He\u2019s not the only Democrat who has the echo of the Sanders-Clinton race still throbbing in their ears nor the only one determined to avoid alienating any of the supporters of this cycle\u2019s candidates. \u201cMany believed the primary was rigged in favor of Hillary Clinton,\u201d Representative Darren Soto of Florida said. \u201cThere is a feeling among many of us that we need to have a broad and diverse field, plenty of debates and let the primary voters decide on their own.\u201d What few lawmakers will say, at least publicly, is that wading into the race can also come with a cost: they run the risk of angering the eventual nominee if they support a losing candidate and they also invite complaints from their own constituents or donors, who may have a different preference. What\u2019s more, they also have to be mindful of their own political branding and how they align themselves.  \u201cPoliticians are different from voters,\u201d said Donna Brazile, the longtime Democratic strategist and former party chair. \u201cThey have to say, \u2018How does this fit with my agenda, my district?\u2019\u201d In Ms. Warren\u2019s case, even one of her biggest boosters, Ms. Haaland, conceded it was easier for her to step out early because of the progressive nature of her district. \u201cSome folks they\u2019re just like, \u2018I better stay out of it for a while because of my district,\u2019\u201d she said of her House colleagues. And it\u2019s not just lawmakers who are taking a wait-and-see approach. Powerful liberal interest groups, including much of organized labor, are also hanging back, which only prompts the politicians to believe it\u2019s safer to remain mum. \u201cThat would make a difference if they came out,\u201d Representative Dina Titus of Nevada said of unions. \u201cThey\u2019re all being coy, too.\u201d Ms. Titus said she planned to get behind a candidate later this year, but her state, the third to vote in next year\u2019s primary, illustrates just how many party elites were remaining neutral: Nevada\u2019s governor, two senators, three Democratic House members and longtime boss, former Senator Harry Reid, have all refrained from endorsing a candidate. Representative Jamie Raskin of Maryland said that he had also been \u201cdrawn in different directions in this race,\u201d noting that he wanted to make a decision that\u2019s both \u201cpassionate and strategic.\u201d But after having lunch in Washington last month with Ms. Warren and her husband, Bruce Mann, Mr. Raskin said he planned on endorsing the senator. \u201cIf all she had to her name was senator from Massachusetts she would not be an ideal candidate,\u201d he said, before citing Ms. Warren\u2019s record as a consumer advocate and critic of Washington self-dealing. \u201cAs a candidate of public integrity and honesty in government, she has a very powerful story to tell at a time of boundless Republican corruption and lawlessness.\u201d What\u2019s more, Mr. Raskin said, \u201cShe made a very eloquent and personal pitch to me.\u201d As for Ms. Pingree, she said she was \u201cwatching the wisdom, the perspective of the public\u201d and was eager \u201cto see who people get excited about.\u201d She will also have a chance to gauge the views of her colleagues. When Congress comes back from its recess this week, Ms. Pingree said she and the other House Democrats who live in her Washington high rise planned on having a debate watch party in the building\u2019s common room.",

At a televised forum on L.G.B.T.Q. issues on Thursday, Senator Elizabeth Warren was asked to consider a hypothetical one. Suppose a supporter approached her and said: \u201cSenator, I\u2019m old-fashioned and my faith teaches me that marriage is between one man and one woman.\u201d How would she respond? \u201cWell, I\u2019m going to assume it\u2019s a guy who said that,\u201d Ms. Warren replied. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to say, then just marry one woman. I\u2019m cool with that.\u201d The audience laughed and applauded. About 10 seconds passed. \u201cAssuming you can find one,\u201d Ms. Warren added, to the delight of the crowd. Viral moments are coveted in the Democratic primary race, where they can serve as a magnet for online donations and bring much-needed attention to candidates struggling to stand out in a large field. Ms. Warren\u2019s answer appeared likely to turn into one of those moments, even though she is hardly struggling to attract attention to her campaign, having risen in the polls to rival former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. as a leading contender for the Democratic nomination. A video of her response at the forum immediately drew attention on Twitter, and the Warren campaign soon shared the moment on her feed as well. Below is a transcript of the exchange: CHRIS CUOMO: You ready for another question? ELIZABETH WARREN: You bet. CUOMO: All right. Morgan Cox, real estate investment firm in Dallas, Texas. He is the chair of the Human Rights Campaign board of directors. Morgan, thank you. WARREN: All right. Hi, Morgan. MORGAN COX: Chris, thank you so much. Hi, senator, thank you for being here.

            "content": " Hours after Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, broke his silence and said that Russia had sought to damage Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign, Mrs. Clinton said that the \u201csystemic efforts to interfere\u201d in the 2016 election \u201cdeserves the attention of every American.\u201d Mrs. Clinton made the remarks as part of a commencement address on Wednesday afternoon to more than 2,400 Hunter College students inside New York City\u2019s Madison Square Garden. Amid a sea of purple caps and gowns, she also leveled fresh criticism at the Trump administration for what she said was its \u201ccomplete refusal to condemn a foreign power who attacked our democracy\u201d and its failure to protect the country\u2019s voting systems against future attacks. \u201cIt seems absolutely clear that we\u2019ve got to deal with what has been investigated and reported,\u201d she said. Earlier in the day, Mr. Mueller held a 10-minute news conference \u2014 his first public characterization of the investigation since it began more than two years ago \u2014 in which he discussed central elements of his report, including the decision to not explicitly clear President Trump of obstruction of justice. He reiterated allegations previously laid out in an indictment that Russian intelligence officers had \u201cused sophisticated cybertechniques to hack into computers and networks used by the Clinton campaign,\u201d and that their release of that information was \u201cdesigned and timed to interfere with our election\u201d and to \u201cdamage\u201d Mrs. Clinton. Mrs. Clinton also used part of her 30-minute commencement speech to criticize what she called \u201cthe big social media platforms,\u201d which she said \u201cknow their systems are being manipulated by foreign and domestic actors to sow division, promote extremism and spread misinformation.\u201d \u201cBut they won\u2019t get serious about cleaning up their platforms unless consumers demand it,\u201d she told the graduates. She specifically rebuked Facebook for its refusal to remove altered videos of Speaker Nancy Pelosi, which first appeared online last week and spread widely. In one of the edited videos, Ms. Pelosi\u2019s speech was slowed down and slurred, making her appear drunk. Ms. Pelosi herself sharply criticized Facebook earlier on Wednesday, telling a public radio station in Northern California that the company\u2019s refusal to take down altered videos of her demonstrated how the social network contributed to misinformation. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t even a close call,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said of Facebook\u2019s decision not to remove the content. \u201cThe video is sexist trash.\u201d Mrs. Clinton\u2019s comments come four weeks after she sharply criticized Attorney General William P. Barr, President Trump, members of the Republican Party and some findings of the Mueller report in a wide-ranging interview on \u201cThe Rachel Maddow Show.\u201d She has also recently appeared in a comedy sketch in which she performed a dramatic reading of the Mueller report, and has spoken out on Twitter about the recent state abortion bans. On Wednesday, she continued to obliquely attack the Trump administration, saying, \u201cWe are witnessing an assault on the rule of law and the foundations of our democracy,\u201d and that democracy \u201cfeels far from secure.\u201d But she sought to keep the mood mostly uplifting and occasionally light. Mrs. Clinton opened her remarks by thanking the Hunter College president, Jennifer J. Raab. \u201cMadam President \u2014 that has a nice ring to it,\u201d she said, to laughs and cheers. Then she mentioned that last year\u2019s commencement speaker was the actor Vin Diesel. \u201cWe\u2019re going to star in a movie together,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s called \u2018The Fast and the Still Really Furious.\u2019\u201d",

            "author": "Edward Wong",
            "content": "  The State Department is continuing an investigation of email use among employees who worked for Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state, asking scores of current and former officials to submit to questioning by the bureau overseeing diplomatic security, former officials said on Sunday. The investigation is examining whether the employees used secure channels and the proper classification designations for what appeared to be routine emails at the time, the former officials said. The emails were on subjects that were not considered classified at the time, but that have been or are being retroactively marked as classified. The inquiry potentially pushes back into the spotlight a deeply political issue that President Trump used as a weapon in his 2016 presidential campaign, and has repeatedly returned to during his time in office, despite the F.B.I. closing a previous investigation without finding wrongdoing by Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Trump\u2019s insistence on raising the issue reflects a pattern in which the president pushes his own narrative even if an investigation or an analysis by an agency in his own administration has concluded otherwise. The emails were sent to Mrs. Clinton while she was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013, in President Barack Obama\u2019s administration. They appear to have come to the attention of the diplomatic security bureau during the earlier inquiries conducted by the State Department, Congress and the F.B.I. into Mrs. Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server. Those earlier investigations threw a long shadow over the 2016 presidential campaign and are considered by Mrs. Clinton and many analysts to be a factor in Mr. Trump\u2019s victory. The renewed focus on the emails was reported on Saturday by The Washington Post, which said as many as 130 officials had been contacted in recent weeks. Sometime soon after Mr. Trump took office and appointed Rex W. Tillerson as his first secretary of state, the department\u2019s diplomatic security bureau carried out the first stages of an investigation into email use by employees under Mrs. Clinton, the former officials said. Most of the people being investigated were political appointees who were leaving or had already left the department. The inquiry focused on the years when Mrs. Clinton was leading the State Department, even though many of the employees continued to work under her successor, John Kerry, the former officials said. The investigators appeared to want to finish the inquiry quickly and move on, the former officials said. At some point during Mr. Tillerson\u2019s tenure, people who had heard of the investigation thought it had ended because the diplomatic security bureau no longer appeared to be actively pursuing the question, the officials said. Mike Pompeo took over as secretary of state in April 2018, and in recent months the diplomatic security bureau has been interviewing current and former employees again about their email use under Mrs. Clinton, the former officials said. Before joining the Trump administration, Mr. Pompeo was a Republican member of the House, and served on the committee investigating the deadly raid on the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya. Mr. Pompeo was among those who aggressively questioned Mrs. Clinton. The Justice Department inquiry into her use of a private email server had its roots in that congressional investigation, which brought to light Mrs. Clinton\u2019s email practices. The former officials who described the current inquiry on Sunday did so on the condition of anonymity, given the sensitivity of the matter. The State Department did not reply to a request for comment on the current investigation. Looking to future prospects of the inquiry, the diplomatic security bureau could decide to make a formal note in a person\u2019s file saying he or she had mishandled classified information, according to the former officials. That could lead to that person being unable to get proper security clearances in the future, or the applicant might have to wait a long time for those clearances to be approved. The former officials said scrutinizing the employees over their handling of information that was not classified at the time, and only retroactively classified, was unusual. Also, many of those emails summarize conversations with foreign officials who themselves have no security clearance in the United States government, yet are engaged in discussions about topics of interest to American counterparts. Moreover, the former officials said, the State Department does not have much in the way of secure devices that employees can use to send material from the field, so employees often send emails that need to be urgently read by the secretary of state or other officials over unsecure lines. For example, a diplomat might be dashing off to catch a flight after a meeting and unable to get back to the embassy to send an email over secure equipment. In many cases, the emails that went to Mrs. Clinton were part of a long email chain created by officials forwarding emails to one another. In the Trump White House, at least seven senior officials, including the president\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, have used personal emails or chat apps to conduct official business. And congressional committees led by Democrats are now investigating the White House\u2019s handling of transcripts of Mr. Trump\u2019s calls with foreign leaders, including a particularly sensitive one in July with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, as part of an impeachment inquiry.",

            "author": "Maggie Astor",
            "content": "  Here\u2019s our rundown of what happened in the Democratic primary this week, as the candidates gear up for Tuesday\u2019s debate in Ohio. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. explicitly endorsed impeachment on Wednesday, going beyond past statements in which he had called only for an impeachment inquiry if President Trump did not cooperate with Congress. \u201cTo preserve our Constitution, our democracy, our basic integrity, he should be impeached,\u201d Mr. Biden told supporters in New Hampshire, as he accused Mr. Trump of having \u201cbetrayed this nation.\u201d It\u2019s been a whirlwind week for Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who is recovering from a heart attack. In addition to the concerns the episode raised about his health, his campaign\u2019s delay in disclosing the heart attack led to criticism about its transparency, which Mr. Sanders has forcefully rejected. Perhaps more consequentially, Mr. Sanders told reporters on Tuesday that he would be changing the \u201cnature\u201d of his campaign by doing fewer events. On Wednesday, he said he had misspoken. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts often tells voters that after she became \u201cvisibly pregnant\u201d at the end of her first year as a public-school teacher, the principal wished her luck and hired someone else to replace her. This week, a conservative news site and other outlets challenged her account, citing a 2007 interview with Ms. Warren and minutes from a school board meeting \u2014 and Ms. Warren pushed back in a unique way. Rather than just restating the truth of her account (though she has done that as well), she called on women to share their own stories of pregnancy discrimination, which remains widespread. CNN and the Human Rights Campaign hosted the latest subject-based forum of the presidential race on Thursday, focused on gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender issues. Protesters interrupted the event at several points to call attention to the murders of black transgender women, and the candidates seemed to welcome the reminder. Before the event, Ms. Warren, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and Senator Kamala Harris of California released plans on L.G.B.T.Q. equality. All three said they would fight to pass the Equality Act and ban conversion therapy as president. This week brought a deluge of new policy proposals on issues ranging from foster care to judicial ethics. The fifth presidential debate will be held in Georgia on Wednesday, Nov. 20, and the hosts will be MSNBC and The Washington Post. As previously announced, candidates will need 165,000 donors and at least 3 percent support in four qualifying polls to make the stage. (An alternative polling option is 5 percent support in two early-state polls.) Eight candidates have met those criteria so far; the latest was Andrew Yang, who did so this past week. Ms. Warren had a crowd-pleasing comeback at the CNN town hall when asked how she would respond to a supporter who said, \u201cSenator, I\u2019m old-fashioned, and my faith teaches me that marriage is between one man and one woman.\u201d Read more about the moment here.",

            "author": "Jonathan Martin",
            "content": "   WASHINGTON \u2014 Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s presidential campaign was under attack, and he and his advisers were torn over what to do. For more than a week, President Trump had been hurling unfounded accusations about Mr. Biden, his son Hunter and their dealings in Ukraine. Mr. Biden and his advisers debated whether to mount a fierce counterattack or to stick to a set of policy arguments he had been planning to roll out. Bad news loomed in the background: Mr. Biden\u2019s poll numbers had already grown wobbly, his fund-raising was uneven, and cable news was flashing chyrons by the hour showing Mr. Trump\u2019s wild claims. Mr. Biden himself was equivocating: He wanted to defend and protect his son, but he also believed the president was baiting him into a dirty fight. And as a lifelong adherent to congressional tradition, Mr. Biden was wary of acting hastily as an impeachment inquiry was getting underway. The strain grew so acute that some of Mr. Biden\u2019s advisers lashed out at their own party, taking the unusual step of urging campaign surrogates to criticize the Democratic National Committee \u2014 a neutral body in the primary \u2014 for not doing more to defend Mr. Biden, while the Republican National Committee was running TV ads attacking him. Frustrated, D.N.C. officials informed the Biden camp that it would continue denouncing Mr. Trump but would not run ads for Mr. Biden or any other candidate. The Biden campaign\u2019s tense deliberations reached a climax last weekend when Mr. Biden agreed to give a scorching rebuttal to Mr. Trump in a speech on Wednesday in Reno, Nev. But he delivered it well into the evening on the East Coast, and it was mostly lost amid another long day of Trumpian eruptions. To some Biden allies, it seemed too little too late: a case study in political indecision. Now Mr. Biden looks more vulnerable than at any point since he entered the campaign. Facing one of the greatest challenges of his candidacy, Mr. Biden has plainly struggled to meet the moment, or fully reconcile his own cautious instincts with his protectiveness of his family\u2019s privacy and his preference for taking the moral high road against Mr. Trump. Interviews with more than 50 Democratic strategists, lawmakers and lobbyists provide a portrait of a candidacy facing challenges on all sides, and one at risk of losing its core argument that Mr. Biden is the Democrat best able to defeat Mr. Trump in a general election. There is no evidence behind Mr. Trump\u2019s claim that Mr. Biden intervened inappropriately with Ukraine to help his son, but Democrats have been unnerved by the president\u2019s onslaught and Mr. Biden\u2019s halting response.  In addition to the attacks from Mr. Trump, Mr. Biden\u2019s top rivals, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, each out-raised him in the third quarter by about $10 million. And as Ms. Warren has emerged as Mr. Biden\u2019s most formidable competition, Mr. Sanders, her main challenger for progressive support, just had  a heart attack, casting uncertainty over whether he could siphon votes from Ms. Warren, as the Biden camp had hoped. Even before last week, Mr. Biden\u2019s advisers were acknowledging to donors that he may well lose both of the leadoff nominating contests in Iowa and New Hampshire. His communications aides contend that most voters were more focused on what Mr. Trump did to prompt the impeachment inquiry than on the false claims themselves. And they pointed to the former vice president\u2019s forceful attacks on Mr. Trump at a news conference Friday to argue that he was now ready to do battle with the president. \u201cThis guy like all bullies is a coward,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cHe does not want to run against me.\u201d On Thursday, Mr. Biden, whose inner monologue rarely remains repressed, gave voice to the tension he is struggling with as he spoke at a fund-raiser in Palo Alto, Calif. Recalling the difficulty Hillary Clinton had in confronting Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign style, Mr. Biden worried about being \u201csucked into the trap of the stuff that Trump was laying. He wants you in a mud fight.\u201d \u201cBut when you respond to that,\u201d he continued, \u201cit brings you back down into that.\u201d Mr. Biden was even blunter, and angrier, in private after news first emerged that Mr. Trump had exhorted the Ukrainian government to investigate him and his son. \u201cI can\u2019t believe this guy is going after my family like this,\u201d he told Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, as the two campaigned in Iowa, Mr. Coons recalled. [Sign up for our politics newsletter hosted by Lisa Lerer and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race.] Leading Democrats have been pleading privately with Mr. Biden and his top aides to aggressively confront Mr. Trump, and expressing impatience with them for not seizing this opportunity to engage him in a two-man race. After all, Mr. Biden had spent months framing his candidacy as a singular crusade to oust an aberrant president. \u201cIt\u2019s time to really respond so everybody hears it,\u201d said Representative Cedric Richmond of Louisiana, a campaign co-chairman. \u201cIf someone says something enough, people will start to believe it, and this president gets in his zone of telling a lie over and over again. You have to make sure people don\u2019t believe in it.\u201d David Plouffe, former President Barack Obama\u2019s campaign manager, was mystified. Mr. Biden \u201cshould use this moment and become Trump\u2019s opponent,\u201d Mr. Plouffe said. \u201cI don\u2019t understand it.\u201d But Mr. Biden is confronting an almost unimaginable situation: the president he hopes to challenge is facing impeachment for urging another country to help smear him. What\u2019s more, the House inquiry centers on what Mr. Biden values most in his private and public life: protecting his family and honoring institutional norms. Several Democrats close to Mr. Biden say he did not take on Mr. Trump sooner in large part because of his reverence for congressional prerogatives \u2014 he did not want to immediately insert himself into the House\u2019s jurisdiction. But Mr. Biden also sought to address the attacks on his son on his own terms rather than sit for hastily arranged television interviews that would have forced him to answer questions about Hunter Biden\u2019s work that few of his own aides dared pose. Now, just as his monthslong lead in the primary is eroding, he faces an opponent who\u2019s threatening his son, the political system he dedicated his adult life to and, as he approaches his 77th birthday, his last chance to become president. For Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign, no attack could have been more difficult to deal with than one involving the candidate\u2019s son. Mr. Biden nearly did not run for president because of the effect it would have on his family \u2014 and particularly on Hunter Biden and his children, according to multiple advisers to the former vice president. Hunter Biden has struggled for years with substance addiction and had recently gone through a very public divorce from his first wife. In separate interviews, Mr. Coons and his fellow senator from Delaware, Tom Carper, both said they had warned Mr. Biden that the president would target his family. \u201cHe expected his family to be attacked,\u201d Mr. Carper said, adding that Mr. Biden assured him he was braced for \u201cthe onslaught.\u2019\u2019 Mr. Biden\u2019s family, including his son, encouraged him to enter the race, knowing the attacks were inevitable. But as Anita Dunn, one of Mr. Biden\u2019s closest advisers, put it: \u201cWhen it happens, it still feels pretty lousy.\u201d The Biden campaign has attempted to handle the candidate\u2019s son with great sensitivity. Mr. Biden made clear at the outset that Hunter, a lawyer who had long advised his father on his campaigns, should not be made to feel excluded, people who spoke with him said. One adviser to Mr. Biden recently telephoned his son to solicit advice on the upcoming debate in Ohio. But to most of Mr. Biden\u2019s aides, Hunter Biden has been a spectral presence. He is living in Los Angeles and stayed away from Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign launch in Philadelphia. Hunter Biden quietly attended the last two debates and appeared with his new wife, Melissa Cohen, at a July fund-raiser in Pasadena, Calif. Still, Mr. Biden\u2019s advisers are aware that Hunter Biden carries political vulnerabilities. His business career has intersected repeatedly with his father\u2019s political power, through roles he had held in banking, lobbying and international finance. Working for a Ukrainian energy company beginning in 2014, he was paid as much as $50,000 a month while his father was vice president, and some of Mr. Biden\u2019s admirers worry that, while Mr. Trump\u2019s accusations are without merit, voters may view Hunter Biden\u2019s actions as problematic. Even one of Mr. Biden\u2019s Democratic rivals, Beto O\u2019Rourke, said on Saturday that he would not allow \u201canyone in my cabinet to have a family member to work in a position like that.\u201d In the past, Mr. Biden has bristled at questions about whether his family had benefited financially from his political career. He did so again on Friday when he was asked whether his son\u2019s work in Ukraine represented a conflict of interest. Pointing a finger at the questioner he said: \u201cLet\u2019s focus on the problem. Focus on this man, what he\u2019s doing, that no president has ever done. No president!\u201d The Trump campaign was soon circulating a clip of the episode. For his allies, it is both poignant and painful that Mr. Biden\u2019s family is again at the heart of his public identity. He lost his first wife and daughter, and nearly lost his two sons, in a car accident in the weeks after he was elected to the Senate in 1972. His final years as vice president, as well as his hopes to run for president in 2016, were overwhelmed by his elder son Beau\u2019s death from brain cancer. Jim Mowrer, a former Democratic congressional candidate from Iowa who served with Beau Biden in the military, said he spoke to Hunter Biden early this year and got the impression he was trying to focus on personal matters rather than the campaign. Mr. Mowrer said he saw the elder Mr. Biden in Iowa last month and they discussed not Hunter but his other son, Beau. \u201cBeau\u2019s death is very, very fresh in his mind, and so now these attacks on Hunter are even more unsettling,\u201d Mr. Mowrer said. The politics of Ukraine and impeachment have been so costly for Mr. Biden, in part, because he is confronting so many other challenges in the Democratic race: a struggle to excite liberal primary voters, an ascendant rival in Ms. Warren and a decline in fund-raising that has forced him to spend even more time appealing to donors in cities hundreds of miles from the early primary states. Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign manager, Greg Schultz, acknowledged some of those problems in a briefing for Democratic donors at Morgan Stanley\u2019s New York office last month. Mr. Schultz assured the group that they had a path to the nomination that depended on winning South Carolina \u2014 the fourth primary state \u2014 and then scoring big victories in the Super Tuesday primaries in March. In South Carolina, where Mr. Biden\u2019s support appears strongest among the early-voting states, some of his supporters are discussing a trip to Iowa before Thanksgiving \u2014 to vouch for the former vice president, and to emphasize his ability to appeal to minority constituencies, like African-Americans. \u201cWe probably know Joe Biden a lot better than they do,\u201d said State Senator Dick Harpootlian of South Carolina, a Biden supporter. Mr. Schultz acknowledged at the briefing that Mr. Biden had been uneven at times during debates and on the stump. Still, he predicted Mr. Biden would maintain an advantage over Ms. Warren, saying she would struggle to overcome the persistent competition on the left from Mr. Sanders. But Ms. Warren has recently pulled well ahead of Mr. Sanders. Now, even Mr. Biden\u2019s own campaign aides privately acknowledge that South Carolina may not be much of a political firewall if Ms. Warren rolls through Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada. As he finds his way forward, Mr. Biden is relying on a circle of advisers, some formal and others less so, but there is no chief strategist. Mike Donilon, who wrote much of the Reno speech, may be the closest person to playing that role. Democrats who know Mr. Biden well say the campaign is mostly in his hands \u2014 and he makes the final calls. While Mr. Biden\u2019s team has done little polling in the race, he is expected to conduct a survey of Iowa Democrats next week on the Ukraine issue ahead of a new advertising push in the state. Mr. Biden has begun to escalate his attacks on the president, and his campaign began airing a commercial hitting back at the president for trying to \u201cpick his opponent and face only the candidates he thinks he can beat.\u201d Still, there is no final consensus, in Mr. Biden\u2019s camp, about how consistently he should confront Mr. Trump. \u201cHe\u2019s never gone negative,\u201d said William M. Daley, the former White House chief of staff, who worked on Mr. Biden\u2019s 1988 campaign. \u201cThat\u2019s not him, that\u2019s the charm of Joe.\u201d",

            "content": " Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has raised $15.2 million in the past three months, his campaign said Thursday, a drop-off of $7 million from the previous quarter and a sum that falls short of two leading Democratic rivals. Mr. Biden, who began the Democratic presidential primary leading in the polls, has seen his advantage slip, falling behind Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts in several recent polls both nationally and in some early-voting primary states, including Iowa and New Hampshire. His total for the third quarter of the year was another sign of unsteadiness. Several of his opponents released their third-quarter totals earlier this week. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who has a strong small-dollar fund-raising base, pulled in $25.3 million, his campaign said Tuesday, while Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., reported $19.1 million raised during the last three months. Senator Kamala Harris of California raised $11.6 million. Ms. Warren has not yet announced her third-quarter total. The deadline for presidential candidates to file their reports is Oct. 15. Last quarter, Mr. Biden pulled in $22 million, one of the biggest hauls in the field for that time period, though he still fell behind Mr. Buttigieg for that quarter. Mr. Biden announced his total at a fund-raiser Thursday afternoon in Palo Alto, Calif., and the campaign announced it in a news release shortly afterward. His campaign declined to comment when asked about Mr. Biden\u2019s cash on hand. At the fund-raiser, Mr. Biden appeared to take a veiled shot at the views of some of his more liberal opponents as he cautioned against a \u201csocialist\u201d response to President Trump, according to a news media pool report from the event. Mr. Sanders is a democratic socialist. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to share in the benefits,\u201d Mr. Biden said at the fund-raiser, where tickets were offered for $1,500 and $2,800. \u201cThat\u2019s been broken. You don\u2019t need some radical, radical socialist kind of answer to any of this \u2014 you\u2019ve just got to make capitalism work like it\u2019s supposed to work. We\u2019ve got to save capitalism from this guy.\u201d Ms. Warren identifies as a capitalist, though she has called for more far-reaching progressive policies \u2014 Medicare for all, for example \u2014 than Mr. Biden supports. Even before the $15 million figure was released, the Biden campaign and allies were playing down the significance of the quarterly total. One close Biden supporter pointed out the lack of traction that Mr. Sanders and Mr. Buttigieg have had among the broader electorate, as reflected in polling, and said that if money were all that mattered then Democrats would be nominating the billionaire financier Tom Steyer. Also Thursday, Mr. Biden was asked for his thoughts on selecting a running mate. \u201cLook, if I could just manufacture someone out of the blue, I would very much think it\u2019s important to have a woman, and even a woman of color, or someone of color as vice president,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve learned something different. Not different. Something else. The single most important thing you have to have as a president is someone you know is ideologically compatible with you, that you in fact share the same fundamental concerns and values.\u201d The Thursday fund-raiser, and the end of the fund-raising quarter, arrived at an uncertain time for Mr. Biden: The House of Representatives is pursuing an impeachment inquiry against Mr. Trump amid revelations that he asked the president of Ukraine to \u201clook into\u201d Mr. Biden and his son Hunter Biden. There is no evidence that as vice president, Mr. Biden intentionally acted to aid his son\u2019s business dealings there, and the news of Mr. Trump\u2019s actions has outraged Democrats and signaled, to some, that the president is concerned about Mr. Biden\u2019s candidacy. While Mr. Biden is fiercely protective of his family, the moment has thrust the delicate subject into the national spotlight \u2014 even as the question of how voters will respond remains fluid, and some of Mr. Biden\u2019s advisers and allies privately acknowledge the risks associated with Mr. Trump\u2019s focus on the Bidens. That dynamic did not stop his team from fund-raising off the developments involving Mr. Trump. The day after details of the president\u2019s conversation came to light, the campaign tripled its daily online fund-raising average, Mr. Biden\u2019s team said, though an adviser did not respond when asked last week whether that pace had continued. During the final days of the fund-raising quarter, Mr. Biden spent much of his time at high-dollar fund-raisers, often attending two or even three in one day as he visited wealthy enclaves like Bel Air, Calif., and Park City, Utah. Mr. Biden has been more reliant on high-dollar donors than some of his rivals in the Democratic primary: Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders have sworn off big-money fund-raisers. At a fund-raiser in Los Angeles last Thursday, Mr. Biden told attendees that his campaign was close to landing nearly 670,000 donations from about 350,000 people, with an average donation of $46, according to a media pool report of the event. At the time, it wasn\u2019t clear if those remarks were referring to the third-quarter haul or to a cumulative total. The campaign said Thursday that 98 percent of all donations came from grass-roots donors of $200 or less, and said that 56 percent of donors this quarter were new to the campaign.",

            "content": " PHILADELPHIA \u2014 Leading donors for Joseph R. Biden Jr. convened this weekend for their first donor retreat since he announced his candidacy and struck a determined posture as Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign found itself under assault from President Trump, losing its clear front-runner status and lapped in the money chase by multiple Democratic rivals, most notably Senator Elizabeth Warren. Over cocktails on Friday evening and a Saturday spent in a drab hotel conference room, Mr. Biden\u2019s top financiers and fund-raisers received strategy briefings and PowerPoint presentations, and plotted the path forward for the former vice president, who suddenly found himself in fourth place in the money chase. Only hours before the gathering began, the news broke that Ms. Warren, now seen as Mr. Biden\u2019s chief rival, had out-raised him in the last three months by nearly $10 million \u2014 $24.6 million to $15.2 million. He lagged behind Senator Bernie Sanders ($25.3 million) and Mayor Pete Buttigieg ($19.1 million), too. While some were downbeat about the financial figures, Mr. Biden\u2019s slip in the polls and the onslaught from Mr. Trump, the Biden loyalists described a sense of almost burden and responsibility. If Mr. Biden is to compete financially with the online windfalls of Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren, several donors said, they believe it would be on the shoulders of the bundlers assembled here. \u201cAll of us realize that Joe Biden does not have the online fund-raising capability of a Warren. Warren has been doing it longer than him. Sanders has been doing it longer than him,\u201d said Dick Harpootlian, a prominent South Carolina supporter who hosted a fund-raiser for Mr. Biden in May. [Which Democrats are leading the 2020 presidential race this week?] Denise Bauer, a former ambassador to Belgium, said there was an urgency in the air. \u201cWe need him to get the nomination because he\u2019s the one who can win,\u201d she said, adding \u201cWe are all going to try to raise every single dollar we can.\u201d Some donors played down the importance of the very currency that had brought them to Philadelphia in the first place for what the campaign called a \u201cfinance committee forum,\u201d questioning, for instance, whether Mr. Buttigieg and Mr. Sanders had the other political assets needed to seriously challenge Mr. Biden. In a sign of the attendees\u2019 significant financial firepower, Mr. Biden himself addressed the several dozen donors who came to the retreat on Saturday, rallying them for 45 minutes about the months ahead, people there said. The campaign kept the session with Mr. Biden behind closed doors, despite pledging to open his fund-raising events to reporters. The campaign said this event with Mr. Biden\u2019s biggest bundlers was different because no money was actually raised. On Friday afternoon, the donors received a tour of Mr. Biden\u2019s downtown Philadelphia office before decamping to the second floor of The Continental Mid-town, a retro-style bar a few blocks away where they sported shiny \u201cJoe 2020\u201d pins and sipped from an open bar. On Saturday, there were a series of closed-door briefings, with updates from most of Mr. Biden\u2019s top brass, including his campaign manager, Greg Schultz, and former chief of staff as vice president, Steve Ricchetti, about the run-up to the Iowa caucuses through Super Tuesday, including delegate math and digital tactics, according to attendees, who were asked to keep the proceedings private. Multiple attendees said Ms. Warren was, by far, Mr. Biden\u2019s most discussed opponent, with his strategists telling donors they expected her to come under new press scrutiny now that she has risen in the polls. Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren, who refuse to hold traditional fund-raisers or coddle members of the contributor class like those gathered in Philadelphia, have raced ahead of Mr. Biden in fund-raising by attracting hundreds of thousands of small donors online. Ms. Warren had 940,000 donations in the last three months; Mr. Sanders had 1.4 million; Mr. Biden, who sharply cut back digital spending in August, has not disclosed his total number of donations. Some contributors played down the significance of money in a race flooded by free news media attention, and for a candidate like Mr. Biden whose reputation has been established after more than a decade in the national spotlight. [Keep up with the 2020 field with our candidate tracker.] \u201cHow is money working out for Sanders and Mayor Pete?\u201d asked John Morgan, a lawyer and top Biden fund-raiser in Florida who has hosted the former vice president at his home but who did not attend the summit. \u201cJoe has more than plenty.\u201d Donors were also shown Mr. Biden\u2019s latest ads; the campaign had announced a $6 million television and digital ad purchase on Thursday in the four early voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. The summit comes less than four months before the opening Iowa caucuses. And it comes as Mr. Trump has relentlessly attacked Mr. Biden, soliciting the assistance of foreign nations to investigate him, his son Hunter and his business deals, sparking an impeachment inquiry in the House of Representatives. Donors, many of whom spoke on condition of anonymity, were on edge about how the impeachment proceedings would play out. Would Mr. Trump\u2019s focus on Mr. Biden end up helping him by making it appear that Mr. Trump fears him? Or would Mr. Trump\u2019s barrage \u2014 including on the airwaves in early states \u2014 and the president\u2019s singular ability to command attention irreparably wound Mr. Biden in the mind of primary voters? \u201cHe\u2019s running a primary campaign and a general at the same time and I think he\u2019s doing a great job,\u201d said Sheila Nix, a former chief of staff to Dr. Jill Biden, who attended the forum. \u201cIt\u2019s a little unprecedented having to do both at the same time.\u201d Biden campaign officials  said that they had always expected the primary race to tighten, it was just a matter of who would emerge as their strongest opponent. Still, the reality began to sink in for the assembled donors: Mr. Biden is likely to be outspent in the coming months. Unlike his two leading rivals, Mr. Biden did not disclose a cash-on-hand total. Mr. Sanders had $33.7 million in the bank. Ms. Warren has $25.7 million. Mr. Biden is expected to report only a fraction of that. Even if he had spent zero dollars since July 1 \u2014 and he has spent millions \u2014 his cash on hand would be less than Mr. Sanders\u2019s or Ms. Warren\u2019s. Mr. Biden spent $5 million in both May and June, the most recent months that federal records are available. His staff and campaign costs have only ballooned since then, suggesting he likely spent nearly all, if not more than, the $15.2 million he raised in the last three months. As the race has narrowed to only three candidates polling consistently above single digits \u2014 Mr. Biden, Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders \u2014 some see an opportunity for Mr. Biden to consolidate a donor class that is typically more moderate than the grass-roots donors powering the Warren and Sanders campaigns. Mr. Buttigieg and Senators Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey have been the chief competitors for bundler loyalty. But Mr. Biden\u2019s uneven performances on the stump and the debates have slowed such movement. During the last debate, a group of Democratic donors gathered for a private event in Manhattan with the strategists James Carville and Paul Begala providing color commentary. When Mr. Biden went on his discursive and meandering answer that invoked a record-player, there were audible groans, and some people threw their arms in the air in frustration, according to an attendee. In an interview, Mr. Carville said Mr. Trump\u2019s recent \u201cobsession\u201d with Mr. Biden made the former vice president\u2019s electability case better than anyone else could. \u201cI think Biden has been given a lifeline here,\u201d Mr. Carville said. \u201cI hope he takes it.\u201d Among the ads attendees were shown was a new one from Friday in which Mr. Biden accused Mr. Trump of trying to \u201cchoose the Democratic candidate.\u201d For all the incoming Mr. Biden has taken \u2014 from his rivals, from the White House and from, as his campaign likes to point out, the news media \u2014 his advisers believe his continued perch atop many polls proves his resilience, no matter his shrinking lead. \u201cI always come away from things with him thinking I\u2019ve got to work harder. I need to do more,\u201d Ms. Bauer said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t ask for that. He inspires that.\u201d",

            "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 When Michaelyn Mankel approached Joseph R. Biden Jr. at an Iowa steak fry last month to demand dramatic action on climate change, the former vice president clasped the 24-year-old\u2019s hands and assured her, \u201cYou\u2019ve got a better deal from me than anybody.\u201d He did, after all, introduce the very first climate change legislation in Congress, in 1986, before Ms. Mankel was born. He also helped to orchestrate the \u201cgreen jobs\u201d strategy under the Obama administration\u2019s economic stimulus package. He supported landmark regulations on coal plants and automobile tailpipe emissions as vice president, and helped to secure the Paris Agreement, the 2015 pact to limit the rise of global temperatures. His climate change plan would spend $1.7 trillion over a decade, impose a tax on greenhouse gases and aim to bring carbon emissions to net zero by 2050. Yet Ms. Mankel, a full-time volunteer for the youth-led Sunrise Movement, was disappointed. \u201cThis far along in his campaign, it seems he is still ill-prepared to answer a serious question about the climate crisis,\u201d she said in an interview. And so it has gone for Mr. Biden, whose experience in the wars over climate change is unmatched among Democratic contenders for the White House, but whose image remains soporific to the young activists driving the debate. \u201cTimes have changed,\u201d said Nigel Purvis, a State Department climate negotiator under Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, who called Mr. Biden \u201ca consistent and reliable climate champion\u201d in the Senate and for the White House. But, he added, \u201cLike most longtime Democratic politicians, Biden has a twenty-year track record of advocating for incremental measures, and today the Democratic primary base wants dramatic action.\u201d A new poll made public Tuesday indicated that Mr. Biden remained the front-runner among Democrats and those who count themselves as \u201cclimate voters.\u201d But other candidates, like Elizabeth Warren, are fast closing in. Meantime, the former vice president keeps being accosted on live television and at campaign events by young activists challenging his commitment and his perceived coziness with fossil fuel interests. It is true that Mr. Biden\u2019s climate plan is neither the priciest nor the most ambitious \u2014 others call for reaching carbon neutrality well before midcentury. His refusal to endorse calls for a ban on hydraulic fracturing, a natural-gas extraction method commonly called fracking, may be politically pragmatic as he courts voters in Pennsylvania and Ohio, but it is not popular with activists. Beyond the policy specifics is the sense that Mr. Biden, 76, is simply not the man of the moment. To young climate activists, his campaign has, so far, failed to capture the urgency outlined by a high-profile United Nations report that warned the Earth was on track to experience fatal heat waves and food shortages by 2040, sooner than earlier projections. On a personal level, the candidate can\u2019t quite connect with an incensed climate movement personified by Greta Thunberg, a 16-year-old Swedish activist who angrily chastised world leaders gathered at the United Nations last month, saying, \u201cIf you choose to fail us, I say we will never forgive you.\u201d Mr. Biden\u2019s supporters seem incredulous that his record and proposals have not won young voters over. \u201cThis is a guy who was introducing bills on climate change before this was on the radar screen of most politicians,\u201d said Jake Sullivan, who served as Mr. Biden\u2019s national security adviser in the White House. \u201cHe\u2019s somebody who talks about the issue in an incredibly passionate and purposeful way.\u201d Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign challenged the belief among many younger activists that the former vice president is not likely to make climate change a top priority if elected. \u201cThere are some folks in the climate movement who are very vocal,\u201d said Stef Feldman, Mr. Biden\u2019s policy director. \u201cThere are also folks who are believers in the drastic efforts that we need to do to combat climate change who think Joe Biden is the best one equipped to address the challenge, because he has the experience of bringing other countries to the table.\u201d But other issues keep drowning out that message. Questions about Mr. Biden\u2019s ability to energize voters on climate change come as national political attention is focused on accusations that President Trump put pressure on the Ukrainian government to investigate Mr. Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, who once sat on the board of a Ukrainian company, Burisma.  (Despite Mr. Trump\u2019s accusations of corruption on the part of the Bidens, no evidence has surfaced that the former vice president knowingly took any steps to help his son or the company.) Trump supporters might focus on Hunter Biden\u2019s monthly salary, as much as $50,000. Climate activists are more concerned about Burisma\u2019s business: natural gas. Fossil fuels and Mr. Biden\u2019s support for them are at the heart of the climate movement\u2019s concerns. Three other Democratic contenders \u2014 Senator Kamala Harris of California, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont \u2014 have called for a national ban on fracking. Mr. Biden has not. (Experts have noted that an outright ban on fracking across the United States would require an act of Congress and could not be done by executive action. However, there are regulatory steps a president could take to limit the practice.) Heather Zichal, an informal adviser to Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign who helped write domestic climate change policies in the Obama administration, served until recently on the board of Cheniere Energy, a liquefied natural gas export company. In September, Mr. Biden attended a fund-raiser hosted by Andrew Goldman, co-founder of another natural gas company, Western LNG. Isaac Larkin, a 27-year-old biologist, asked Mr. Biden about that fund-raiser during a forum on climate change on CNN last month and accused the candidate of violating a pledge not to accept money from fossil fuel executives. Mr. Biden responded that Mr. Goldman did not meet that definition because he was no longer involved with the day-to-day operations of the company and did not sit on the board. Mr. Larkin, in an interview, criticized \u201cBiden\u2019s attempt to clip hairs about who is or isn\u2019t technically a fossil fuel executive.\u201d He also took issue with the position of the Obama administration that natural gas is an important \u201cbridge fuel\u201d to transition from coal to renewable sources like wind and solar. \u201cThe bridge is on fire and we need to get off the bridge and get to a new place immediately,\u201d Mr. Larkin said. Ms. Feldman noted that the former vice president has called for banning oil and gas drilling on public lands. She also said that even the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a group of scientists convened by the United Nations to guide world leaders in policymaking, has acknowledged a role for natural gas as a way to reduce emissions from coal plants. Of course, no Democratic plan has a chance without the White House, and no Democrat will win the presidency without swing states where the fossil fuel industry employs thousands, such as Pennsylvania, which Mr. Trump won by less than 1 percentage point. Mr. Biden was born in Scranton, Pa. Christopher Borick, director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion, said it was possible for a candidate who opposes fracking to win Pennsylvania, but he said that was not Mr. Biden\u2019s style. \u201cHis approach is staying close to the middle, giving enough strength on environmental issues to show he\u2019s a vast improvement over the president and hope that does the trick,\u201d Mr. Borick said. \u201cThat\u2019s consummate Biden.\u201d That style rubs young voters like Ms. Mankel the wrong way. She acknowledged that she was unfamiliar with most of the Obama administration\u2019s signature regulations to rein in greenhouse gases. She said she was sure they were ambitious compared to what came before. \u201cBut frankly,\u201d she added, \u201cthey weren\u2019t enough.\u201d",

            "content": " ROCHESTER, N.H. \u2014 Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Wednesday called for President Trump\u2019s impeachment for the first time, blistering Mr. Trump as a threat to American democracy and accusing him of \u201cshooting holes in the Constitution.\u201d Escalating his language in an effort to rebut Mr. Trump\u2019s unfounded claims about his actions with Ukraine, Mr. Biden set aside months of restraint to demand Congress move against the president. \u201cTo preserve our Constitution, our democracy, our basic integrity, he should be impeached,\u201d the former vice president told supporters here, accusing Mr. Trump of having \u201cbetrayed this nation.\u201d Mr. Biden even linked Mr. Trump\u2019s false claims to the so-called Big Lie idea promulgated by the Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels. \u201cYou say it long enough, often enough, people may believe it,\u201d he said, invoking Goebbels by name. While Mr. Biden stopped short of calling for Mr. Trump\u2019s removal from office, his new aggressiveness marked an acknowledgment that he must do more to both confront a president who is attacking him daily and to halt his slide in the polls in the Democratic primary. The former vice president has openly wrestled with how forceful to be with Mr. Trump, lamenting last week that the president wants to drag opponents into \u201ca mud fight.\u201d But Mr. Biden is increasingly sharpening his rhetoric under pressure from allies to embrace the head-to-head race. Mr. Trump is facing an impeachment inquiry in the House because of his request to the Ukrainian government that it look into what Mr. Biden did with the country when his son, Hunter Biden, was working for a gas company there. On Wednesday, Mr. Biden again denied that he did anything improper as vice president. And he accused Mr. Trump, who has accused Mr. Biden of corruption and whose campaign is airing ads repeating the same claim, of acting entirely out of a desire to undermine his candidacy. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to let Donald Trump pick the Democratic nominee for president, period,\u201d said Mr. Biden, who has fallen behind Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts in a series of national and early nominating state polls. \u201cHe\u2019s picked a fight with the wrong guy.\u201d The president apparently watched the speech, or was told of it, because even before it was over he noted on Twitter that Mr. Biden had called for his impeachment and claimed the Bidens had \u201cripped off at least two countries for millions of dollars.\u201d \u201cJoe\u2019s Failing Campaign gave him no other choice!\u201d wrote Mr. Trump. There is no evidence that Hunter Biden made millions of dollars from his overseas work or that his father intervened inappropriately with Ukraine or China, the other country Mr. Trump was alluding to in his tweet. The president has also urged China to look into the Bidens. Mr. Biden again denied that he did anything improper as vice president. He noted that his 2016 call to fire Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin, was part of United States government policy under President Barack Obama. It also reflected the wishes of a group of Republican senators at the time, who sought Mr. Shokin\u2019s ouster because he was seen as unwilling to target corruption, Mr. Biden said. A longtime senator before he became vice president, Mr. Biden is deferential to congressional prerogatives and has resisted calling for impeachment, even as Ms. Warren and many of his other Democratic rivals have been outspoken in demanding it. Last month, when House Democrats began moving toward an impeachment inquiry, he said they should only do so if Mr. Trump did not cooperate with their investigation. Then last week he said he would let Congress \u201cdo its job on impeachment.\u201d And at a later event on Wednesday, in Manchester, N.H., he nodded to his longstanding discomfort with impeachment, calling it \u201ca God-awful thing for a nation to go through.\u201d But as Mr. Trump and his allies wage near-daily political warfare against Mr. Biden, he has sought to mount a counteroffensive. He began his rebuttal in a speech last week in Reno, Nev., but on Wednesday he went even further. Speaking from a teleprompter and dressed formally in suit and tie, he used his first trip back to New Hampshire since the impeachment investigation got underway to both taunt and condemn Mr. Trump in remarkably stark language. \u201cHe\u2019s afraid about just how badly I will beat him next November,\u201d said Mr. Biden, attempting to frame the general election as a contest between him and the president, and appealing to Democratic voters here and elsewhere who are consumed with finding a nominee who can oust Mr. Trump. But he also used his speech, which lasted just under 30 minutes, to warn of the damage he claimed Mr. Trump was doing to the country. \u201cWe all laughed when he said could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot someone and get away with it,\u201d said Mr. Biden. \u201cIt\u2019s no joke. He\u2019s shooting holes in the Constitution, and we cannot let him get away with it.\u201d He argued that impeachment was crucial not just because of what the president had done but also in trying to curb Mr. Trump from committing additional abuses in office. For Mr. Biden, the question now is how to balance countering Mr. Trump\u2019s onslaught with articulating his own policy vision and contrasting himself with his Democratic opponents. He sought to do all three in his appearance in Manchester, reciting many of his same lines about Mr. Trump at the outset of his speech before turning to his record on gun control and domestic violence prevention. \u201cIt takes a proven ability to get things done,\u2019\u2019 he said. And, he reminded the audience in an unmistakable reference to Ms. Warren\u2019s raft of policy plans, \u201cWe\u2019re not electing a planner.\u201d",

Mr. McConnell would rise from his chair in the Capitol, walk to his scheduler\u2019s desk, smile a tight smile, and ask: \u201cCan we get Joe Biden on the phone?\u201d That was precisely what happened in late 2012, when Republicans were still in the minority in the Senate, and Mr. McConnell hit an impasse with Harry Reid, the Democratic leader, over the elimination of Bush-era tax cuts for the wealthy. As a New Year\u2019s Eve deadline approached, Mr. Biden and Mr. McConnell hammered out an agreement in a dozen phone calls, aides to both men said, with Mr. Obama signing off on every move. The two sides struck a deal that delivered some, but far from all, of what Mr. Reid wanted. This year, as he runs for president, Mr. Biden cites that deal and others he cut with Mr. McConnell as proof of his skill in achieving bipartisan legislation in an otherwise hyperpartisan environment. \u201cI\u2019ll work with Mitch McConnell where we can agree,\u201d Mr. Biden said this month \u2014 adding that on some issues, like gun control, there was no room for compromise. That he could agree with Mr. McConnell on anything is a controversial statement for any Democrat to make these days. But in a sprawling field of 20 candidates, Mr. Biden stands out for his enduring belief in the good will of congressional Republicans. He insists that the G.O.P. has been bullied by President Trump but that civility and compromise will return to Washington once Mr. Trump is gone. It\u2019s a view that has been branded as na\u00efve and wistful by some Democratic rivals as well as by the ascendant left wing of his party. That criticism is particularly pointed with regard to Mr. McConnell, whose decision to block Mr. Obama\u2019s nomination of Merrick B. Garland to the Supreme Court in 2016 elevated him from mere obstructionist to arch-villain in the eyes of many Democrats. The criticism has only intensified in recent days as Mr. McConnell has rebuffed Democratic calls to quickly move ahead with gun control legislation and lashed out at Democrats for reviving attacks on Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. As a result, many in the party say, Mr. Biden\u2019s comfortable relationship with the Senate leader is not only out of date, but dangerous. \u201cMitch McConnell over the last decade has basically been on a crusade to destroy the Senate, so this idea that just getting rid of Trump would somehow send us back to some Golden Age in the Senate is ridiculous,\u201d said Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, a rival presidential candidate. Mr. Bennet was one of three Democratic senators to vote against the 2012 budget deal, viewing it as an unnecessary capitulation that has emboldened Mr. McConnell. \u201cYou have to have some pretty seriously rose-colored glasses to think that the last six years of the Obama administration showed great promise in terms of deliberation or legislation,\u201d Mr. Bennet said. [Sign up for our politics newsletter hosted by Lisa Lerer and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race.] Mr. Biden and Mr. McConnell were not especially close in their nearly 25 years together in the Senate. But interviews with two dozen people close to both men show that their relationship, while not quite an actual friendship, became stronger \u2014 and more mutually beneficial \u2014 during Mr. Obama\u2019s second term. Their negotiations offered Mr. Biden a more powerful role, and gave Mr. McConnell a congenial bargaining partner and what the Senate leader viewed as the path of least resistance to striking a deal, in the view of Biden critics. Mr. Biden and his defenders say he is being attacked for refusing to accept what they consider a false premise: that progress is possible only through the use of uncompromising political force. \u201cHow in the hell are you going to get a damned thing done if you don\u2019t talk to the other side?\u201d said former Senator Alan Simpson, Republican of Wyoming, who struck up an across-the-aisle friendship with Mr. Biden in the 1970s. \u201cI see people saying he can\u2019t be president because he talked to this one or that one,\u201d Mr. Simpson added. \u201cHere\u2019s what I want to tell them: You think you can be a United States senator, and do your job, really do your job, by not talking to the other side? You have to talk to the commies, the kooks, the racists, the Tea Party, you have to talk to everybody.\u201d Mr. Biden, 76, has said he is bound to Mr. McConnell and other opponents by \u201ccivility\u201d and an unbreakable, unwritten code that the Democratic leader Mike Mansfield preached to him early in his career: \u201cIt\u2019s always appropriate to question another man\u2019s judgment, but never appropriate to question his motives.\u201d As senators, Mr. Biden and Mr. McConnell had little interaction. They served briefly together on the Judiciary Committee in the late 1980s, and worked on only one significant piece of legislation together, a 2007 measure seeking to improve human rights in Myanmar. By 2010, however, Mr. McConnell had reached two conclusions that pushed him toward Mr. Biden, according to a dozen people close to both men, who spoke anonymously to disclose private discussions. First, he did not believe he could work with Mr. Reid, a former prizefighter who viewed Mr. McConnell as an obstructionist who needed to be thwarted at all costs. Mr. McConnell, for his part, thought Mr. Reid was not a good-faith negotiator, and suspected Democrats were leaking details of negotiations, two people close to him said. Then there was Mr. Obama. The two men felt deeply uncomfortable in each other\u2019s presence, according to their aides and their own public statements. In his book, Mr. McConnell admitted he privately called the president \u201cProfessor Obama\u201d because he was so prone to lecturing him. Mr. Obama and his aides thought Mr. McConnell was disdainful and taciturn, according to former members of Mr. Obama\u2019s staff. \u201cFrom the beginning, it was clear that President Obama wanted Biden to take the lead with McConnell,\u201d said Ted Kaufman, a longtime aide and friend to Mr. Biden. \u201cBiden had a very realistic view of McConnell and knew that they had major differences.\u201d After being overshadowed during Mr. Obama\u2019s first term, Mr. Biden embraced the opportunity to become a power player. In 2010, Mr. McConnell and Mr. Biden negotiated a last-minute deal that prevented a government shutdown. A year later, Mr. McConnell hit the Biden speed dial again, this time to avert a potentially catastrophic failure to raise the debt limit precipitated by Tea Party Republicans in the House. All of that was a dress rehearsal for 2012 and another showdown over the debt limit, the so-called fiscal cliff. Mr. Obama was fresh off a convincing re-election win over Mitt Romney that was propelled, in part, by his promise to scrap tax cuts for families earning more than $250,000, enacted by George W. Bush in 2001. Mr. Reid staked out a maximalist position, saying he was willing to go over the cliff; Mr. Obama, despite having campaigned on the issue, was worried \u201cthat a sudden major tax hike and massive spending cut could together trigger another recession,\u201d Gene Sperling, a top Obama economic aide, said in an interview. [Which Democrats are leading the 2020 presidential race this week?] Two days before the deadline, the talks stalled. That\u2019s when Mr. McConnell placed his call to Mr. Biden, who was on Air Force Two. \u201cGet off now!\u201d Mr. McConnell said in a voice mail message, according to former aides to both men. From there, things went fairly quickly. Mr. McConnell, aides said, was spooked by the election results and eager to cut a deal; Mr. Biden operated within a narrow range of parameters established by Mr. Obama and his economic team, but he also brought his own reassuring presence to the talks. \u201cWhen he\u2019d say, \u2018Mitch, it\u2019s Joe. You know me. I am telling you there is no way we can go there\u2019 \u2014 that kind of thing was always more convincing coming from him,\u201d Mr. Sperling recalled. At one tense moment, Mr. Biden \u2014 hunched over a speakerphone in his office with Mr. Sperling and other staff members \u2014 struggled to remember the name of Rohit Kumar, the McConnell adviser crunching the numbers for Republicans. \u201cOh, hell, can I just call you Mitch\u2019s guy?\u201d Mr. Biden said, according to a person who was on the call \u2014 to laughter. The deal they struck was a partial victory for Democrats, raising top tax rates for families earning more than $450,000 and extending some unemployment insurance benefits. \u201cI feel very, very good,\u201d Mr. Biden told reporters on New Year\u2019s Day. Others did not. A handful of progressive Democrats \u2014 including Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Jeff Merkley of Oregon, Tom Harkin of Iowa and Bernie Sanders of Vermont \u2014 stormed into Mr. Reid\u2019s office to complain, according to Democratic aides. He told them to vote with their consciences and informed the White House he would back the deal, but would not sell it. The measure passed easily. During a follow-up meeting in the Oval Office in early 2013, Mr. Obama pressed Mr. McConnell to work on a long-term budget package before the 2014 midterms, when he would be running for re-election in Kentucky, Mr. Reid recalled in a recent phone interview. Mr. McConnell said that was impossible \u2014 Republican primary challengers could use it against incumbents. Mr. Biden responded by saying, \u201cMitch, we want to see you come back,\u201d Mr. Reid said. In recent years, Mr. Biden has not been shy about criticizing Mr. McConnell\u2019s actions, especially the decision to block Judge Garland. But he has been loath to denounce him personally \u2014 to the annoyance of some of his own staff members, according to a current Biden adviser. Neither man has much incentive these days to highlight their bonhomie: Mr. McConnell will also be running for office in 2020, seeking a seventh term. His office declined to comment for this story. But both men spoke affectionately about each other when there was less at stake politically. In December 2016, Mr. McConnell offered an emotional send-off to Mr. Biden from the well of the Senate, recounting a boyhood battle that echoed his own struggles with polio as a toddler. \u201cThe man we honor today wasn\u2019t always a talker,\u201d he said. \u201cHe suffered from a debilitating stutter for most of his childhood. He was teased for it. But he was determined to overcome it. And so he did.\u201d When Mr. Biden\u2019s son Beau died in 2015, Mr. McConnell was the only Senate Republican to attend his funeral, a gesture that deeply moved Mr. Biden, according to a person close to Mr. McConnell. In 2011, Mr. Biden, commenting on the large crowd that saw him speak at the University of Louisville\u2019s McConnell Center, peered at his host and said: \u201cYou want to see whether or not a Republican and Democrat really like one another. Well, I\u2019m here to tell you we do.\u201d",

            "content": "  CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa \u2014 Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. found himself fending off new questions about his decades-long record on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender issues, in a testy exchange with a moderator who described his treatment of her as \u201ccondescending.\u201d During a Friday night forum focused on L.G.B.T.Q. issues, Mr. Biden seemed to recoil from the direct questioning from Lyz Lenz, a Cedar Rapids Gazette columnist. In a question-and-answer session, Ms. Lenz repeatedly pressed Mr. Biden about his past votes for the Defense of Marriage Act, the military\u2019s \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d policy that forbade openly gay people from serving and his statement earlier this year that Vice President Mike Pence, known for his socially conservative positions, was \u201ca decent guy.\u201d Mr. Biden sought to defend himself, reminding the audience in a steamy auditorium that he supported same-sex marriage before President Obama. \u201cI didn\u2019t have to evolve,\u201d he said. Then, before an audience of 700 volunteers, activists and voters, he called Ms. Lenz \u201ca lovely person,\u201d prompting her to reply, \u201cjust asking the questions people want to know. Offstage after their exchange, she wrote on Twitter that Mr. Biden called her \u201ca real sweetheart.\u201d \u201cI interpreted it as a little condescending,\u201d Ms. Lenz said in a backstage interview, echoing the immediate criticism of some prominent feminists on social media. Supporters of Mr. Biden said Ms. Lenz\u2019s questions included a series of inaccuracies. His supporters said he didn\u2019t back \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d and voted for an amendment to remove the measure from a broader bill in 1993. They also argue that she misrepresented the impact of the 1994 crime bill that he championed. Mr. Biden had already responded to criticism of his comments about Mr. Pence earlier this year, writing on Twitter shortly after his initial remark that \u201cthere is nothing decent about being anti-L.G.B.T.Q. rights, and that includes the vice president.\u201d The forum, hosted by advocacy group Glaad, marked the first extended public discussion of L.G.B.T.Q issues in the 2020 Democratic primary race, which went largely unmentioned in the Democratic debates so far despite the group representing a loyal bloc within the Democratic Party. The focus on candidates\u2019 past departures from contemporary progressive politics stemmed in large part from the lack of daylight between most of the major candidates on issues of L.G.B.T.Q. equality: nearly all back banning conversion therapy for minors; rolling back the spread of rules that allow religious businesses to decline serving L.G.B.T.Q. customers; and ending the Trump administration transgender military ban. Most have promised to pass the Equality Act, legislation opposed by the White House that would bolster the list of protected classes under civil rights law to include discrimination based on \u201csexual orientation\u201d and \u201cgender identity.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s about time we had a woke president on these issues,\u201d Senator Cory Booker said, \u201cso we see everyone for the equal dignity and equal citizenship we all have.\u201d The candidates boasted about their accomplishments \u2014 large and small \u2014 on behalf of L.G.B.T.Q Americans. Mr. Booker noted that as mayor of Newark, he had vowed not to officiate any weddings until everyone had the right to wed. Senator Elizabeth Warren opened her appearance by reading the names of 18 trans women of color who have been killed this year. Mr. Biden said he has been sympathetic to same-sex couples since he was a boy, when, he said, he and his father witnessed two men kissing while disembarking from the train station in Wilmington, Del. \u201cHe said, \u2018Joey, it\u2019s simple,\u2019\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cThey love each other.\u201d In a historically diverse field, the L.G.B.T.Q. community has celebrated their own record-breaking first: Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., the first openly gay man to mount a major campaign for president. Though Mr. Buttigieg has collected significant financial support from leaders in the gay community, some have begun to question his commitment to their causes. While Mr. Buttigieg frequently references his husband, Chasten, at campaign events and told his coming out story on the debate stage last week as an example of resiliency, he hasn\u2019t placed L.G.B.T.Q. equality at the center of his campaign. He faced questions about a ban on gay men donating blood, pointing out that as mayor he couldn\u2019t participate in a blood drive sponsored by his office. \u201cIt\u2019s an example, one of many examples, of the exclusions in this country,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are still living with the long tail of prejudices.\u201d Other candidates also came with long records to tout. Mr. Biden, a reliable L.G.B.T.Q. ally, frequently points to his early support of gay marriage, noting his decision to break with the Obama administration and publicly endorse the policy in 2012. Mr. Obama followed a few days later. Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii faced questions about her history of anti-gay stances, including decrying \u201chomosexual extremists\u201d when her home state debated whether to legalize civil unions more than a decade ago. Ms. Gabbard has apologized for her past statements and said she no longer holds those views. \u201cMy record speaks for itself,\u201d she said, citing her history of serving with L.G.B.T.Q people in the military and congressional record of supporting equality measures. About 5 percent of voters in the four early Democratic primary states \u2014 Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina \u2014 identify as L.G.B.T.Q., according to data collected by the Human Rights Campaign, the nation\u2019s largest L.G.B.T.Q. rights organization. Another 23 percent prioritize L.G.B.T.Q.-inclusive policies when voting, according to the group. The event is the first of two forums hosted by L.G.B.T.Q. organizations to question the candidates on their views. A second event, hosted by Human Rights Campaign in Los Angeles, will be broadcast on CNN next month.",

            "content": "  In public, for the last five days, Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his campaign have been on a ferocious offensive, ripping into President Trump for allegedly abusing his powers in asking Ukraine\u2019s leader to help hurt Mr. Biden politically, and castigating the news media for questioning his son Hunter Biden\u2019s financial dealings there. On Tuesday, Mr. Biden made his biggest move yet, saying Congress should start an impeachment inquiry against Mr. Trump if he does not cooperate with their investigations. In private, though, this has been an enraging and uncertain time for the Biden campaign, and for Mr. Biden himself, who associates say has been astounded both by Mr. Trump\u2019s contact with the Ukrainian government and his obvious enthusiasm for attacking Mr. Biden\u2019s family. He and his advisers have long feared that Hunter Biden would become a target for political opponents, according to people familiar with their thinking, and now the scrutiny of Mr. Biden\u2019s son is bound to intensify. And as Mr. Trump\u2019s onslaught has pushed the House of Representatives to start an impeachment inquiry, Mr. Biden now faces a crucial political test where his standing may hinge on how he handles a wildly unpredictable confrontation with Mr. Trump. Bryce Smith, the Democratic Party chairman in Dallas County, Iowa, said the moment showcased Mr. Biden as a candidate Mr. Trump is \u201cgenuinely worried about\u201d and offered a reminder of the lengths Mr. Trump may go to oppose any Democratic opponent. But it also exposed Mr. Biden to risks in the leadoff caucus state, he said. \u201cI could see people who are already on the fence about him, maybe because of his long career in politics, his age, his ability to win this, kind of going, \u2018Oh, great, we\u2019re already starting this and he hasn\u2019t even gotten the nomination,\u2019\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cAnd others going, \u2018He\u2019s obviously being thought of as a formidable opponent, if Trump is thinking about it like this.\u2019\u201d Mr. Biden and his campaign team have encouraged the latter interpretation, trying to project an image of strength in the primary and warning the press that the Biden campaign would deliver blunt criticism about coverage it sees as unfair. At a Philadelphia fund-raising event on Monday, Mr. Biden pledged, \u201cI\u2019m not going to take a punch and not punch back.\u201d Yet allies of Mr. Biden acknowledge privately that the campaign has been girding for months for criticism of Hunter Biden, who has charted a winding career as a bank executive, lobbyist and financier, often operating in parts of the private sector that overlapped with his father\u2019s footprint in government. They have declined to say whether they vetted Hunter Biden\u2019s business activities as part of preparing for the 2020 presidential campaign, arguing that the political world should be solely focused on Mr. Trump\u2019s conduct. There is no evidence that Mr. Biden, as vice president, intentionally tried to help his son in his dealings with Ukraine, but Hunter Biden\u2019s business career has sporadically drawn attention from political rivals and the media for more than a decade. Associates say Mr. Biden is infuriated by Mr. Trump\u2019s conduct and astonished by the president\u2019s willingness to dismiss some of the most basic ethical lines in American politics. In Wilmington, Del., Tuesday, Mr. Biden called the president\u2019s actions an \u201cabuse of power\u2019\u2019 that undermined national security, and said he would support impeachment if Mr. Trump did not provide information related to congressional investigations. In some respects, Mr. Trump\u2019s conduct has reinforced the central message of Mr. Biden\u2019s appeal to Democratic voters: that the country is threatened by an out-of-control presidency, and that ousting Mr. Trump is more important than any other policy goal Democrats might share. At fund-raisers and other events, Democrats who have spoken with Mr. Biden in recent days say he has largely appeared measured, greeting old friends in his typical effusive style and keeping the focus on his concerns with Mr. Trump\u2019s foreign policy, rather than dwelling on the challenges the moment raises for his family. Still unclear in this moment of crisis is what conclusions Democratic voters might make about Mr. Biden as an opponent for Mr. Trump, and how a drive for impeachment in Congress might shape the Democratic primary campaign. Former Gov. Tom Vilsack of Iowa, who saw Mr. Biden at a fund-raiser in Iowa on Saturday, said he believed that Mr. Trump\u2019s dangerous conduct was at the forefront of Mr. Biden\u2019s mind. \u201cI suspect he\u2019s just as focused and just as concerned about that as he is about an attack on a family member, as personal as that is,\u201d said Mr. Vilsack, who served as agriculture secretary in the Obama administration. A memo circulated to political surrogates from the Biden campaign on Tuesday urged supporters to note that \u201cthis isn\u2019t about Biden or his family. We all know who Trump is,\u201d and also suggested criticizing reporters for giving undeserved coverage to Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks on Mr. Biden and his son. \u201cTrump is successfully playing the same game he played in 2016 \u2014 and the press is falling for it again,\u201d the memo stated. This clash has come at a precarious moment for Mr. Biden\u2019s candidacy, as he seeks to recover momentum after a largely limp summer on the campaign trail. He has slipped in the polls over the last two months and faces an increasingly formidable challenge from Senator Elizabeth Warren: Two polls released in recent days showed her slightly overtaking him in Iowa and New Hampshire, the leadoff states in the Democratic nomination process. In the short term, at least, Mr. Trump may have effectively put Hunter Biden off limits for his father\u2019s Democratic rivals. It is unlikely that any other candidate in Mr. Biden\u2019s party would soon follow Mr. Trump in going after the former vice president\u2019s son on the subject of business ethics, while Mr. Trump may face an impeachment inquiry for allegedly pressuring a foreign government to do just that. Senator Bernie Sanders, for one, deflected a reporter\u2019s question on Tuesday about whether he thought the sudden focus on Hunter Biden\u2019s overseas work would weaken the Biden campaign. \u201cYou guys write very perceptive articles on these things, and I\u2019ll let you make that judgment,\u201d he replied. It is unclear, however, how well prepared Mr. Biden and his campaign may be to address questions about Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings beyond the specific case Mr. Trump has attempted to raise. Hunter Biden has operated for years in parts of the business world that intersected with his father\u2019s career in government, including working for MBNA, a Delaware-based bank, while his father was involved in rewriting the bankruptcy code as a senator, and leading an investment fund that did business in foreign countries while his father was vice president. Hunter Biden\u2019s work for MBNA briefly became an issue during his father\u2019s campaign for the vice presidency in 2008, and Obama-Biden campaign officials defended it as within the bounds of ethical propriety. TJ Ducklo, a spokesman for Mr. Biden, said the former vice president was indeed angry that Mr. Trump was \u201clying about his family, and now appears to be blackmailing a foreign government into helping legitimize those lies.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s fighting back, which is what Democrats want to see in their nominee and why he will beat Donald Trump next fall,\u201d Mr. Ducklo said, adding, \u201cThe V.P. and his family know Donald Trump plays dirty, and they can take it.\u201d Mr. Ducklo declined to say whether the campaign had vetted Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings and said the media should not be asking questions like that. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to indulge Trump\u2019s conspiracy theories, and we\u2019re not going to dignify his attacks with a response,\u201d he said. Mr. Biden is said to have limited patience for discussing Hunter Biden\u2019s apparent political vulnerabilities, even in private. Some of Mr. Biden\u2019s close advisers have argued in private settings that going after any member of Mr. Biden\u2019s family \u2014 including Hunter Biden \u2014 would ultimately backfire on an opponent, because of Mr. Biden\u2019s stature and the sympathetic feelings much of the public has for him and his family. For Mr. Biden, the matter of his son is deeply sensitive for reasons that have nothing to do with politics: While the whole Biden family endorsed his choice to enter the 2020 race, friends of Mr. Biden said consistently throughout his deliberations that his deepest anxiety was the impact of a campaign on a family still grappling with profound loss after the death of Mr. Biden\u2019s elder son, Beau Biden, in 2015, from brain cancer. \u201cI know that he worked through that, he did a lot of contemplation about how it would affect the family,\u201d said the Rev. Joseph Darby, an influential South Carolina-based pastor who has known Mr. Biden for years. Earlier this year, Hunter Biden spoke in detail to The New Yorker magazine about the crippling grief he experienced after his brother\u2019s death, and his long-running struggles with drug addiction. The magazine story also detailed a number of potential ethical conflicts in Hunter Biden\u2019s business activities and described the vice president as having dealt \u201cwith Hunter\u2019s activities by largely ignoring them.\u201d",

Mr. Biden made his comments during a campaign swing through Nevada after days of internal debate among his advisers over how best to refute unsubstantiated claims by the president and his personal lawyer that Mr. Biden improperly assisted his son\u2019s business ventures in Ukraine and China. The counterattack, people close to Mr. Biden said, was intended to demonstrate what he had been promising supporters for the past week: that he would not let Mr. Trump \u201chijack\u201d his campaign by allowing the president\u2019s narrative to take root. It was also intended to prove, in a walk-and-chew-gum kind of way, that he could multitask even when facing withering political fire \u2014 unveiling a serious policy proposal on guns early Wednesday in Las Vegas, then pivoting to a sharp political attack by nightfall in the north. In the speech, the former vice president said the attacks on his family were intended to divert attention from the widening impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump\u2019s attempts to pressure Ukraine to investigate the Bidens \u2014 and he cited them as proof that the White House feared him more than any other Democratic presidential contender. \u201cLet me make something clear to Trump and his hatchet men and the special interests funding his attacks against me: I\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d Mr. Biden told a crowd of about 500 at the Truckee Meadows Community College here. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to destroy me,\u201d he said to cheers from supporters, a handful wearing \u201cImpeach 45\u201d jerseys. \u201cAnd you\u2019re not going to destroy my family. I don\u2019t care how much money you spend or how dirty the attacks get.\u201d The American people, Mr. Biden said, \u201cknow me and they know him. The idea of Donald Trump attacking anyone\u2019s credibility is a joke.\u201d Earlier in the day, speaking at a gun safety forum in Las Vegas, Mr. Biden blasted the president and his personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, who had communicated with Ukrainian officials on Mr. Trump\u2019s behalf. He said there was \u201czero, zero, zero\u201d evidence that his family had done anything wrong. Mr. Biden\u2019s increasingly bitter fight with Mr. Trump comes at a potential tipping point in the 2020 Democratic presidential race. Until recently, Mr. Biden had been leading in most national polls since he entered the field last spring. But Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, fueled by a highly disciplined campaign, has surged in many early-voting states. A Monmouth University national poll released Wednesday showed Mr. Biden locked in a statistical dead heat with Ms. Warren, who garnered 28 percent support from Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters to his 25 percent, a difference within the survey\u2019s margin of error. At Wednesday night\u2019s rally, Mr. Biden took a swipe at some of his Democratic opponents who had accused him of focusing too much on Mr. Trump and not enough on issues facing voters. \u201cA lot of my opponents say we have to do more than just beat Donald Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cI agree. We have to do more than beat Donald Trump. We have to beat him like a drum.\u201d Mr. Biden\u2019s team has been alarmed by reports that Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters plan to launch an aggressive advertising campaign to portray the former vice president as the person who had acted improperly \u2014 despite the lack of any evidence to support that claim. And Mr. Biden\u2019s top advisers have been equally incensed by what they view as the news media\u2019s willingness to air unsupported allegations by Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani. The president and his lawyer have alleged that Mr. Biden, as vice president, pressured the Ukrainians to force out a top prosecutor in order to derail an inquiry into a Ukrainian company that had paid his son, Hunter Biden. But Mr. Biden said Wednesday that he had been enforcing the demands of the Obama administration and other Western nations by seeking to replace the prosecutor with an official more committed to fighting corruption. On Sunday, Anita Dunn and Kate Bedingfield, two senior Biden strategists, wrote to several major television networks asking them to stop booking Mr. Giuliani on their news programs, accusing him of spreading \u201cdebunked conspiracy theories.\u201d Mr. Biden amplified that argument on Wednesday, urging reporters to regard Mr. Trump\u2019s statements, and his tweets, as not simply fodder for controversy but as a dangerous \u201cabuse of power\u201d that included enlisting foreign leaders as allies in his re-election effort. Mr. Trump, he said, is \u201cafraid of just how badly I would beat him next November.\u201d The president, in his own remarks on Wednesday, did not agree. \u201cI\u2019d rather run against Biden than almost any of those candidates,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House.",

            "content": " Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s presidential campaign has sharply scaled back his online advertising, cutting spending so severely since August that he is now investing only a fraction of what his top rivals are on Facebook and Google, the two dominant internet platforms. In a race where many voters are following politics on their smartphones, Mr. Biden\u2019s pullback is an unusual and potentially worrisome sign about his appeal among the Democratic activists, young people and donors who are especially engaged on social media. Candidates rarely withdraw so much money from their online campaigns unless they are seeing weak results in online fund-raising, according to interviews with digital strategists. Mr. Biden and other candidates will start announcing fund-raising results as early as Tuesday morning for the third quarter of 2019; he came in second for the last quarter, behind Pete Buttigieg, pulling in online money early but mostly relying on big donors. More recently, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and other top rivals have outspent Mr. Biden online: He was only the sixth-biggest Democratic spender on Facebook ads in the seven days ending Saturday, even as he began spending more money on digital ads targeting President Trump, Ukraine and impeachment. Instead, he has shifted his spending priorities toward traditional tactics like buying television ads in Iowa. But that strategy has not paid dividends so far: Ms. Warren, a leading rival for the 2020 nomination, recently surpassed him in a key Iowa poll. Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign strategy has been driven, from the start, by the political assumption that the Democratic electorate is more moderate than the progressives who are often loudest online, and he has built his candidacy around appealing to older and more centrist voters. But strategists say Mr. Biden\u2019s online pullback is risky if he hopes to engage and build support among a broader cross-section of Democrats that is almost certainly necessary to win the nomination. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that there\u2019s something in the numbers that\u2019s directing them to go in that direction, and the likeliest explanation is that the rate of return just wasn\u2019t there for Facebook and Google,\u201d said Tim Lim, a veteran Democratic digital strategist unaligned in 2020. \u201cWhich is very, very unusual.\u201d Zac Moffatt, a Republican strategist who led digital operations for Mitt Romney\u2019s presidential run, said abandoning a medium used heavily by so many \u201creeks of desperation.\u201d \u201cYou are spending at least a third to half your life on your mobile phone, and they\u2019re deciding they don\u2019t need to have a message for you there,\u201d Mr. Moffatt said. Online spending serves two purposes: Promoting the candidates\u2019 messages and raising money. The Biden campaign said it was committed to an ongoing digital plan, with a seven-figure digital ad buy planned in the fourth quarter of 2019. But if Mr. Biden struggles to collect small donations online, he will have to depend more on traditional donors and bundlers while his two leading rivals, Ms. Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, emphasize their grass-roots support. The decline of Mr. Biden\u2019s online spending has been precipitous. He entered the race in April as one of the contest\u2019s biggest digital advertisers, spending $1.2 million on Facebook and Google in his first two weeks. Now he is toward the back of the pack. During a 30-day stretch leading up to the September debate, Mr. Biden, who has regularly led the field in national polls, ranked 16th among the Democratic presidential candidates for advertising on Facebook, spending only $32,000 \u2014 placing the former vice president behind two candidates who dropped out during that period and five who did not make the debate stage. And on Google, his spending plunged to $300 during one week in August \u2014 less than one-thousandth of what he spent in his first week as a candidate, when campaigns often spend the most. Ms. Warren spent $66,000 that same week. The Biden campaign cast its diminishing digital footprint as part of a broader strategy. \u201cOur campaign invested a robust digital spend early on to build out supporter lists, outspending all other campaigns from our launch through most of the summer,\u201d said T.J. Ducklo, a spokesman for Mr. Biden. \u201cBy strategically front-loading our investment, we were able to rapidly expand our reach early, instead of meting out our spend over a longer period of time.\u201d Mr. Biden\u2019s digital spending has ticked up in recent days, as he bought a slate of Facebook ads related to Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to have Ukraine investigate the Biden family (\u201cStand with Joe,\u201d some ads say). The exploding story line about foreign interference and impeachment has been good for Mr. Biden\u2019s bottom line: A campaign official said the past week was Mr. Biden\u2019s best for fund-raising since the second week of his campaign. While Mr. Biden\u2019s Facebook ads, like his stump speech, have focused heavily on Mr. Trump, records show he has also tested messages on health care, Medicare, the Supreme Court and guns. The Biden campaign noted that it was still investing in other online platforms that make less advertising data available to the public, such as Spotify, Amazon and Hulu.  Mr. Biden began his campaign with a show of strength, raising $6.3 million in the first 24 hours from nearly 100,000 people. He began with a key advantage: Formerly President Barack Obama\u2019s running mate, he had access to the old email list from the Obama campaigns. Daily fund-raising data through June shows that Mr. Biden\u2019s first days were his strongest for attracting online donations. But in the last six weeks for which data is available, Mr. Biden spent a meager $20,900 on Google, a platform that includes both the internet\u2019s dominant search engine and YouTube. In that same six-week span, Ms. Warren spent more than 25 times as much: $553,700. \u201cIt is not a good sign for his campaign,\u201d said Marne Pike, the chief executive of a Democratic digital strategy firm not affiliated with any 2020 candidate. \u201cI would have a very hard time imagining no one was searching for Joe Biden and clicking on the ads.\u201d It was a similar story on Facebook. There, Mr. Buttigieg has been the top spender, outpacing Mr. Biden in the last 30 days by a ratio of about 12 to 1. Mr. Biden is being outspent by candidates who, like him, are household names with big campaign budgets (like Mr. Sanders, by more than 7 to 1 in the last 30 days), and also by lesser-known figures (the former housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, who has struggled to raise money, by more than 2 to 1). As Mr. Biden has withdrawn from Facebook and Google, he has bought up more than $700,000 in television ads in recent weeks in Iowa. Despite those ads, Ms. Warren recently edged ahead of him in the closely monitored Des Moines Register poll of likely Iowa caucusgoers. Mr. Ducklo, the Biden spokesman, said small contributions \u201chave been essential to getting our campaign message in front of voters: funding our television ads in Iowa and rapidly expanding the field operations in the early states that is knocking doors and making calls.\u201d Andrew Bleeker, president of the Democratic digital firm Bully Pulpit Interactive, said that Mr. Biden\u2019s more moderate position in the Democratic primary could make it harder to raise money online. \u201cFrom a brand perspective, he can\u2019t be that incendiary and that\u2019s what\u2019s rewarded online,\u201d he said. Keegan Goudiss, who served as Mr. Sanders\u2019s director of digital advertising in 2016 but is unaligned in 2020, agreed: \u201cJoe Biden hasn\u2019t thrown the kind of red meat he needs to throw to do well online.\u201d Mr. Biden has also wrapped his candidacy in an aura of inevitability, which does not allow him to sound the alarm to supporters, a tactic that can juice online giving. (Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, for instance, recently scored his biggest day for online donations when he said he would quit the 2020 race if he failed to raise $1.7 million by the end of this month.) One startling measure of Mr. Biden\u2019s diminished online fund-raising ambition is the goal his campaign announced for the last days of September: raising $500,000. By contrast, Mr. Buttigieg set out to raise $1.5 million online, Senator Kamala Harris of California $1 million, former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas $750,000 and the businessman Andrew Yang $1.5 million. At this juncture in the election cycle \u2014 with the first primary votes still more than four months away \u2014 most campaigns with spare money are still spending heavily online for what they call \u201cacquisition\u201d: convincing people to give their email addresses through petition drives, online surveys and the like. Those people are then wooed to become donors. But for Mr. Biden, an analysis of both the content and geographic distribution of his ads suggests he had mostly abandoned trying to acquire new online donors in the last month \u2014 at least until the recent Ukraine controversy. The Biden campaign said it had put $40,000 into ads over two days last week, more than it spent on Facebook during that recent 30-day stretch. The ads that Mr. Biden has been running target an older electorate than that of his top rivals, according to demographic data collected by Bully Pulpit. An overwhelming share of his spending on Facebook \u2014 84 percent \u2014 has targeted voters who are 45 or older. Compare that to Mr. Sanders, who recently touted that the most common age among his donors is 29. Only one-third of his Facebook ad budget has targeted those above 45.",

            "content": " President Richard M. Nixon was running low on bipartisan allies. Indictments were piling. Impeachment was coming. Mr. Nixon was not a crook, he insisted, though that 18-and-a-half-minute gap in the Watergate tapes did make the town wonder. But from the Senate floor in April 1974, Joseph R. Biden Jr., a 31-year-old freshman Democrat, addressed his congressional elders with a plea: Let the Republican president have his say. \u201cIn the case of an impeachment trial, the emotions of the American people would be strummed, as a guitar, with every newscast and each edition of the daily paper,\u201d Mr. Biden warned. \u201cThe incessant demand for news or rumors of news \u2014 whatever its basis of legitimacy \u2014 would be overwhelming.\u201d He urged against \u201cAlice-in-Wonderland\u201d justice: \u201csentence first, verdict afterwards.\u201d He said that if he had to render a judgment on that day, his choice would be \u201cNot Guilty.\u201d Mr. Biden was no fan of the president\u2019s, he said \u2014 and might well find him culpable once all facts were aired. But this was a time for \u201crestraint.\u201d \u201cI have a feeling,\u201d he said, \u201cthat my children and my grandchildren will be looking back on what I said or did not say in April of 1974.\u201d Forty-five years later, Mr. Biden finds himself consumed by an impeachment drama of a different sort. He is at the center of the emerging Democratic case against President Trump, who in a July phone call pressed the president of Ukraine to investigate Mr. Biden and his son. It is a testament to the long and winding arc of Mr. Biden\u2019s public life that he has been a player in every major impeachment debate of the last half-century. Yet while other 2020 candidates have long argued that Mr. Trump\u2019s conduct demands an extraordinary constitutional response, Mr. Biden has approached the subject with striking wariness, quick to defend his name but disinclined to position himself as an impeachment crusader, despite the perils the president\u2019s unsubstantiated attacks may pose to Mr. Biden\u2019s own campaign. On Wednesday, after weeks of caution \u2014 leaving the task to Congress, taking care to stay in his lane \u2014 Mr. Biden called unambiguously for Mr. Trump\u2019s impeachment for the first time, saying the president had \u201cbetrayed this nation.\u201d It was a moment that Mr. Biden reached reluctantly. Though he had said before that Mr. Trump had probably violated his \u201cconstitutional responsibility,\u201d the former vice president has also called Mr. Trump\u2019s prospective impeachment \u201ca tragedy.\u201d A review of Mr. Biden\u2019s history with the topic, as a senator during the Nixon and Clinton administrations, helps explain why. Decades before he moved from ensemble figure to leading character in the nation\u2019s impeachment theater, friends and peers from his Senate days say those episodes made plain to Mr. Biden just how damaging and unseemly the proceedings could be for all involved. In both public remarks and private conversations with colleagues, Mr. Biden conveyed his discomfort with overturning the will of the voters, regardless of the executive transgression. He suggested that public opinion should be taken into consideration, even for senators who preferred to vote their conscience, since it was the choice of the electorate that lawmakers presumed to override. \u201cThis. Is. Their. President,\u201d he thundered at an event in November 1998 as President Bill Clinton\u2019s fortunes rested with Congress, summarizing the view of Democratic voters whom Mr. Biden said he had met. \u201cDon\u2019t screw with him unless you have an overwhelming case that you can make that you\u2019re being fair about it.\u201d And in an early signal of Mr. Biden\u2019s deference to formal protocol, his experiences in the 1970s and 1990s seemed to crystallize the abiding faith in institutions \u2014 deep respect for the Senate, a reverence for process \u2014 that remains his hallmark, even as his current competitors suggest he is out of step with the crackling tribalism of the Trump era. \u201cHe stuck with kind of an institutional approach to things, which he did for his whole career,\u201d said Ted Kaufman, a longtime friend and aide who worked for Mr. Biden during Watergate and later succeeded him briefly as senator. \u201cLet the system work.\u201d For a young lawmaker straining to find his way amid personal tragedy, the Nixon fracas was an early test of Mr. Biden\u2019s defer-to-convention instincts and a jarring introduction to the capital. After his election in 1972, Mr. Biden had spoken to Mr. Nixon in an uncomfortable, minute-long courtesy phone call from the president after Mr. Biden\u2019s wife and young daughter were killed in a car crash that December. (\u201cI understand you were on the Hill at the time, and your wife was just driving by herself,\u201d Mr. Nixon said, stammering for a few beats, according to a recording. \u201cThe main part is, you can remember that she was there when you won a great victory.\u201d) In his floor speech on impeachment, labeled in the Congressional Record under \u201cFairness to the President,\u201d Mr. Biden described himself as a harsh critic of Mr. Nixon, but he added that the president was due the \u201cutmost presumption of innocence.\u201d \u201cIn a day when equality is on everyone\u2019s lips, I suggest that in practice, in extraordinary times involving our highest office of government, some people may be, in fact, more equal than others,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cAnd in this case, I refer to the president. His official derelictions, if proved, and his subsequent ouster, should it occur, will have an impact on our institutions and upon ourselves as Americans, beyond that which it would have for any of us who are involved in such a proceeding.\u201d Moving through the Capitol, Mr. Biden seemed awed at the historical burden that greeted him. \u201cWe were walking down the hall and he said, \u2018What a time for me to come into the Senate,\u2019\u201d recalled Rufus Edmisten, then the deputy chief counsel to the Senate Watergate committee. \u201c\u2018I would come at a time like this.\u2019\u201d In his 2007 memoir, \u201cPromises to Keep,\u201d Mr. Biden described a formative memory of a crucial meeting after Mr. Nixon asked Senator John Stennis, a conservative Democrat from Mississippi, to run interference for the White House by listening to the Watergate tapes and summarizing them for his colleagues, rather than insisting on their wide release. \u201cI remember what he said in the Democratic caucus that day: \u2018I\u2019ve thought long and hard on what my obligation is,\u2019\u201d Mr. Biden wrote, quoting Mr. Stennis, \u201c\u2018and I\u2019ve decided I am a Senate man. I am not the president\u2019s man. Therefore, I will not listen to the tapes. I am a man of the Senate.\u2019 I\u2019m proud to say I am a Senate man, too.\u201d Mr. Kaufman said that it was not until August, days before Mr. Nixon\u2019s resignation, that Mr. Biden became convinced that the president must go. The senator was walking to catch a train when word arrived that Charles Wiggins, a Republican congressman who had led the Nixon defense, had changed his mind amid revelations that Mr. Nixon had worked to conceal the Watergate break-in. \u201cHe just said, \u2018O.K., this is it,\u2019\u201d Mr. Kaufman recalled of Mr. Biden. \u201cAnd he dictated, literally, to the staff person on what was a big deal: \u2018It was time for Nixon to resign.\u2019\u201d Mr. Biden and his fellow senators seemed relieved that the president had saved them the spectacle of a trial. \u201cNobody was looking forward to the trial,\u201d said J. Bennett Johnston, a former Democratic senator from Louisiana, remembering a petition in his home state to support Mr. Nixon, with some 40,000 names attached. \u201cThere was not as much support in the South for Nixon as there is for Trump now, but he was basically pretty popular. So nobody was looking forward to having to vote on that.\u201d A quarter-century later, when the Senate impeachment trial of Mr. Clinton began, Mr. Biden was not afforded the luxury of a presidential resignation. But with the leader of his own party under scrutiny, Mr. Biden often invoked his appeals for caution in the Nixon age as evidence that he was being intellectually consistent. He said it was a \u201cserious mistake\u201d to overlook public sentiment on impeachment, noting that Democrats had won gains in the 1998 midterm elections. He claimed that the Republican-led House, under Speaker Newt Gingrich, had \u201cproceeded without sufficient dignity.\u201d Barbara Boxer, a former California Democratic senator who joined Mr. Biden in clearing Mr. Clinton in the Senate trial, described impeachment as \u201ca miserable experience\u201d but one that played to Mr. Biden\u2019s strengths as a \u201cstatesman.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s not just going to run out there in flames,\u201d she said. But at times, impeachment has also coaxed less subtle flourishes from Mr. Biden. In an appearance at the National Press Club in November 1998, after distinguishing between immoral and impeachable behavior, he set off on a hypothetical about Mr. Clinton and Monica Lewinsky, implying that had Ms. Lewinsky been Mr. Biden\u2019s daughter, he would have clocked the sitting president. \u201cWere it my daughter \u2014 notwithstanding this particular young woman is not the epitome of what I would want a young woman to be \u2014 I would be looking for the man,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cThose who know me know I\u2019m not joking. I\u2019d be looking for him to give him a straight right.\u201d Notwithstanding this particular senator\u2019s fatherly dream sequence, he also reminded the crowd of his credibility on the broader question of Mr. Clinton\u2019s professional fate. \u201cI made that plea in 1974, and I make the plea again,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cThe plea for restraint.\u201d",

            "content": " Each time a mass shooting strikes one of our communities we grieve. We gather our loved ones. We reach for answers and clamor for action. Each time, for a moment, it feels as if this time will be different. But then the news cycle rolls on. And we push down the gut-churning knowledge that it will be only a matter of time before it happens again. Between El Paso and Dayton only about 13 hours elapsed. Republican leaders try to prevent action and parrot N.R.A. messaging \u2014 as Donald Trump did last week when he said, \u201cMental illness and hatred pulls the trigger, not the gun.\u201d This is the same president who during his first year in office repealed a rule President Barack Obama and I put in place to help keep guns out of the hands of people with certain mental illnesses. This is the same president who said after Charlottesville that there were \u201cvery fine people on both sides,\u201d and who continues to fan the flames of hate and white supremacy. We can\u2019t trust his diagnosis. We have a huge problem with guns. Assault weapons \u2014 military-style firearms designed to fire rapidly \u2014 are a threat to our national security, and we should treat them as such. Anyone who pretends there\u2019s nothing we can do is lying \u2014 and holding that view should be disqualifying for anyone seeking to lead our country. I know, because with Senator Dianne Feinstein I led the effort to enact the 1994 law that banned assault weapons and high-capacity magazines for 10 years. Those gun safety reforms made our nation demonstrably more secure. They were also, sadly, the last meaningful gun legislation we were able get signed into law before the N.R.A. and the gun manufacturers put the Republican Party in a headlock. I fought hard to extend the assault weapons and high-capacity magazines bans in 2004. The Republicans who allowed these laws to expire asserted that they were ineffective. But, almost 15 years after the bans expired, with the unfortunate benefit of hindsight, we now know that they did make a difference. Many police departments have reported an increase in criminals using assault weapons since 2004. And multiple analyses of the data around mass shootings provide evidence that, from 1994 to 2004, the years when assault weapons and high-capacity magazines were banned, there were fewer mass shootings \u2014 fewer deaths, fewer families needlessly destroyed. There\u2019s overwhelming data that shootings committed with assault weapons kill more people  than shootings with other types of guns. And that\u2019s the point. Shooters looking to inflict mass carnage choose assault weapons with high-capacity magazines capable of holding more than 10 rounds. They choose them because they want to kill as many people as possible without having to stop and reload. In Dayton, where the police responded immediately and neutralized the shooter within about 30 seconds, he was still able to massacre nine people and injure more than two dozen others because he carried an AR-style weapon with a magazine capable of holding 100 rounds. We have to get these weapons of war off our streets. Nearly 70 percent of the American public support a ban on assault weapons \u2014 including 54 percent of Republicans. When you have that kind of broad public support for legislation that will make everyone safer, and it still can\u2019t get through the Senate \u2014 the problem is with weak-willed leaders who care more about their campaign coffers than children in coffins. The 1994 assault weapons and high-capacity magazines bans worked. And if I am elected president, we\u2019re going to pass them again \u2014 and this time, we\u2019ll make them even stronger. We\u2019re going to stop gun manufacturers from circumventing the law by making minor modifications to their products \u2014 modifications that leave them just as  deadly. And this time, we\u2019re going to pair it with a buyback program to get as many assault weapons off our streets as possible as quickly as possible. I won\u2019t stop there. I\u2019ll get universal background checks passed, building on the Brady Bill, which establishing the background check system and which I helped push through Congress in 1993. I\u2019ll accelerate the development and deployment of smart-gun technology \u2014 something gun manufacturers have opposed \u2014 so that guns are keyed to the individual biometrics of authorized owners. There is so much we can do \u2014 practical, sensible steps that draw broad support among the American people. But we will see only more and deadlier shootings if we continue to dodge the core issue of unregulated assault weapons and high-capacity magazines in our communities. If we cannot rise to meet this moment, it won\u2019t just be a political failure. It will be a moral one. It will mean that we accept the next inevitable tragedy. That we are desensitized to children running from schools and bodies littering parking lots, that our outpouring of thoughts and prayers will grow increasingly hollow. It\u2019s unacceptable that children learn to fear mass shooters alongside their ABCs, that people feel unsafe on their weekly grocery run, and that families everywhere experience increasing anxiety that they are simply not safe anywhere in the United States. I, for one, won\u2019t stand for that. And the American people are with me.",

            "content": " It turns out that John McCain\u2019s most important service to American democracy was not rendered in a P.O.W. camp in Vietnam. It\u2019s being rendered right now in the U.S. Senate. In the first place, McCain seems to be the only member of Congress who insists on holding hearings and working toward compromise before passing major legislation. This would seem to be the very elemental prerequisite of good government \u2014 like a doctor seeking a diagnosis before performing surgery \u2014 but McCain appears to be the only member, or at least the only Republican, willing to risk unpopularity to insist upon a basic respect for our sacred institutions. Second, McCain is one of very few Republicans willing to stand up for the American story. Human beings can be rallied around one of three things: religion, tribe or ideals. Donald Trump and the campus multiculturalists want to organize people by ethnic tribe, which has always been the menacing temptation throughout our history. But McCain seeks to preserve our traditional rallying point \u2014 our ideals. My colleague Bret Stephens has already quoted from McCain\u2019s speech on Monday at the National Constitution Center. I\u2019d encourage you to read the whole thing because this should be the rallying cry around which the nation rediscovers its soul. Third and most important, McCain still believes that paideia is essential for democracy. Paideia is the process by which we educate one another for citizenship. Paideia is based on the idea that a healthy democracy requires a certain sort of honorable citizen \u2014 that if we\u2019re not willing to tell one another the truth, devote our lives to common purposes or defer to a shared moral order, then we\u2019ll succumb to the shallowness of a purely commercial civilization, we\u2019ll be torn asunder by the centrifugal forces of extreme individualism, we\u2019ll rip one another to shreds in the naked struggle for power. As the brilliant Spanish philosopher Javier Gom\u00e1 Lanz\u00f3n reminds us, most moral education happens by power of example. We publish the book of our lives every day through our actions, and through our conduct we teach one another what is worthy of admiration and what is worthy of disdain. Public figures are the primary teachers in this mutual education. Our leaders have outsize influence in either weaving the moral order by their good example or ripping it to shreds by their bad example. McCain\u2019s career has had its low moments, as all of ours do \u2014 a banking scandal, Sarah Palin \u2014 but he exemplifies a practical standard of excellence to an extraordinary degree: enduring in Vietnam, seeking compromise legislation on everything from immigration reform to campaign spending, condemning torture after 9/11. Moreover, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s another politician now living who devotes so much of his speeches to little biographies of his own exemplars, people like James Stockdale, Bud Day, Morris Udall and Master Sgt. Roy Benavidez. He has turned his own heroes into educational resources for his country, and used them to evangelize our national ideals. These sorts of testimonies help weave a shared moral order, which is necessary to unite, guide and motivate a diverse country. That is an essential bulwark in the age of Trump. That is what needs rebuilding. Books will someday be written on how Trump, this wounded and twisted man, became morally acceptable to tens of millions of Americans. But it must have something to do with the way over the past decades we have divorced private and public morality, as if private narcissism would have no effect on public conduct. It must have something to do with the great tide of moral libertarianism from Herbert Marcuse on down. This tide taught that progress meant emancipating the individual from shared moral orders. It taught transgression was always delightful and that morality was individual and optional. The acceptability of Trump must also have something to do with millions of religious voters being willing to abandon the practical wisdom of their faiths \u2014 that what exists inside a person is more important than what is external, that no bad tree yields good fruit, that you should never trade spiritual humility for worldly ferocity because in humility there is strength and in pride there is self-destruction. We\u2019ve reached a point in which the tasks of paideia have been abandoned and neglected. \u201cOne could say,\u201d Gom\u00e1 writes in his book \u201cPublic Exemplarity,\u201d \u201cthat we are looking for the ideal of a virtuous republic composed of citizens relieved of the burden of citizenship.\u201d It\u2019s not working out. Gom\u00e1 continues, \u201cIn a time of freedom such as ours marked by subjectivism and vulgarity, a tolerance not tempered by virtue will lead inevitably toward barbarism.\u201d Barbarism and vulgarity we have in profusion. Through his daily utterances, Trump is influencing the nation in powerful ways, but none would call it paideia. Few would say he is spreading a contagion that we\u2019d like our children to catch. The moral fabric of society is invisible but essential. Some use their public position to dissolve it so they can have an open space for their selfishness. McCain is one of the strongest reweavers we have, and one of our best and most stubborn teachers.",

            "content": " WASILLA, Alaska \u2014 People here in Sarah Palin's hometown learned science from her father. They remember how she led the Warriors to an unexpected high school basketball championship, her success as a beauty queen and how her family grew along with the Wasilla Bible Church. So when Palin, then a young mother, ran for the City Council in 1992, of course they voted for her. And they kept doing so, for mayor and then for governor \u2014 especially the women who, like her, had small children, hated abortion and prayed every day. \"I admire her intelligence and I admire her integrity, but first and foremost she's a mom, and she has an understanding of what being a mom is,\" said Janet Kincaid, a grandmother and Republican who last summer opened her lakeside Wasilla home for a $20,000 Palin fund-raiser. As Palin, a first-term Republican governor, sampled the curried tuna puffs and gave her speech, Kincaid recalled, even the woman who cleans Kincaid's house decided to give money. Although some liberal Democrats dismiss them as \"Palinbots\" for their reflexive devotion, these women are as dedicated to Palin as the women Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democrat of New York, called her sisterhood of the traveling pantsuits were to their very different version of the modern female politician. These are women who dip in and out of the work force, believe in prayer and spend their days trying to keep the crayon off the walls. They feel they have been looked down on by Clinton feminists and ignored by the power structure in the Republican Party. The fact that Palin has five children, including Trig, a newborn with Down syndrome, only makes her that much more part of the sisterhood. \"I'm not that into politics,\" said Delores Field, an Alaska Inupiat from Eagle River, near Anchorage, who does not consider herself a Democrat or a Republican. \"I'm just going to vote for Trig Van Palin's mom.\" This segment of Palin's supporters are not the women of Phyllis Schlafly's deeply conservative generation of Republican women, nor are they the polished women who might have enjoyed lunch with the first lady, Laura Bush, in her Texas days. Like many women in the valley where Palin comes from, her appeal here, and in recent days across the country, is more about who she is \u2014 that is, a devout Christian with a husband who supports her career, but a person who is not afraid to show up in public with a baby on her hip. \"She didn't create this, but she showed up at the right time,\" said Darla Shine, whose Happy Housewife Club franchise includes a talk radio show, a book and a Web site that receives millions of hits a month. \"She represents a huge pocket of women who have been the ignored community for so long.\" Although strong opposition to abortion and an evangelical approach to Christianity are often shared traits among the Palin women, they do not necessarily walk lock step with Republican politics, said Serrin Foster, president of Feminists for Life, a lobbying group with 28,000 members, including Palin. Some of the group's members are vegans who might not appreciate Palin's penchant for hunting moose. Others might consider themselves moderates who could vote for either party. \"There is a spectrum within the pro-life movement,\" Foster said, \"and Sarah is proof that you can be pro-life and pro-woman.\" Rick Mystrom, a Republican who was the mayor of Anchorage when Palin was Wasilla's mayor, said other women in Alaska who are politicians, like Senator Lisa Murkowski, also a Republican, are seen differently, as part of the Alaska political machine. ( Murkowski supports abortion rights.) \"Sarah's appeal,\" Mystrom said, \"is that she is everywoman and she became what every woman thinks she can become.\" Palin's evangelical Christian beliefs were an asset in this conservative state, and they also helped propel her to the Republican ticket as Senator John McCain's running mate. She is part of a generation of Christian women who began serving on school boards and small governmental bodies in the 1990s, and often look out for one another. When she bucked her party and then ran against the Republican governor in 2006, she did not get much support from the traditional channels. So Republican women's clubs around the state came through by raising tens of thousands of dollars for her campaign. Palin's political career has grown along with her church, which began with a few families and recently moved to a new building that seats 400 and hosts three services on Sunday. Steve Menard, a member of the church who is running for Wasilla mayor next month, said that although the church helped Palin's rise, a political climate ready for someone like her was helping her national profile. \"You needed the right candidate at the right time,\" Menard said, \"to open doors for working women who share a set of values.\" Her ability to mix church, family and politics is part of the draw. Through connections with other longtime family friends, including political allies and members of her church, she was able to raise the sales tax in Wasilla as a way to help finance a $15 million sports complex that featured a new hockey rink for her son Track to play on. This summer, several Christian groups came together for a day of prayer at the arena. Palin was there with her infant Trig in her arms and a daughter, Piper, nearby. Some of Palin's critics say that her popularity, to a degree, is superficial. Mike Doogan, who for 14 years was a columnist with The Anchorage Daily News before he became a Democratic state legislator, said he understood her appeal to a certain type of female voter. But Doogan said her image was carefully cultivated to do just that. \"There is no more unlikely hockey mom on this planet,\" he said. \"They are usually not this politically ambitious or cut-throat.\" Anne Kilkenny, who said she voted for Palin in city elections, said she became disillusioned with her after participating in Wasilla city government and seeing Palin up close. \"You've got to remember,\" Kilkenny said, \"we are not much bigger than a high school and she is the homecoming queen.\" None of that matters for the women who see Palin's rise as their rise. \"Sarah Palin is a different kind of feminist,\" said Joy Ng, who lives in Kodiak with her husband of 35 years. \"She is a strong woman who can wear a skirt and be proud of it.\"",

            "content": " Sarah Palin\u2019s defamation lawsuit against The New York Times Company was reinstated by a federal appellate court on Tuesday, with a three-judge panel ruling that a District Court judge was wrong to dismiss it two years ago. The case involves an editorial The New York Times published in June 2017. Ms. Palin, the former vice presidential candidate, argued in her lawsuit that the editorial had incorrectly linked her to a 2011 mass shooting in which Gabrielle Giffords, then a congresswoman from Arizona, was severely wounded. Ms. Palin\u2019s political action committee had previously circulated a map of electoral districts, some with cross hairs on them, and she said The Times had connected the map to the shooting despite knowing that tie to be false. The Times later issued a correction, saying there was no link between that political rhetoric and the shooting. In August, Judge Jed S. Rakoff of Federal District Court in Manhattan dismissed the suit after an unusual evidentiary hearing in which James Bennet, the editor of the Times editorial page, testified. He said he had not intended to blame Ms. Palin for the shooting of Ms. Giffords, but rather to make a broader statement about the country\u2019s heated political environment. Mr. Bennet inserted the statements that Ms. Palin said were defamatory during the editing process. On Tuesday, a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that it was not for a judge to determine whether Mr. Bennet had acted out of \u201cactual malice,\u201d meaning that he either knew that what he wrote was false or that he acted with \u201creckless disregard.\u201d The judges said that in light of Mr. Bennet\u2019s testimony, Ms. Palin\u2019s case remained \u201cplausible.\u201d \u201cThis is \u2014 and has always been \u2014 a case about media accountability,\u201d Libby Locke and Ken Turkel, lawyers for Ms. Palin, said in a statement on Tuesday. \u201cWe are pleased with the court\u2019s decision, and we look forward to starting discovery and ultimately proceeding to trial.\u201d Eileen Murphy, a spokeswoman for The Times, said, \u201cWe are disappointed in the decision and intend to continue to defend the action vigorously.\u201d",

In another video,\u00a0Hice visited a warehouse he called a \"miniature Walmart,\" full of basic necessities like socks, toothbrushes, and clothing for detained migrants. The disagreement stemmed from comments Ocasio-Cortez had made after a visit to a Border Patrol facility at the beginning of July.\u00a0On July 1, after touring the facility, Ocasio-Cortez tweeted to say Border Patrol officers were telling detained migrant women\u00a0 \"to drink out of the toilets,\" sparking a social media firestorm.

Devin Nunes, R-Calif., who is the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, accused Ocasio-Cortez of promoting a \"socialist\" agenda of \"one-party control\" of government. \"The more I think that they\u2019re out there promoting this kind of craziness and silliness, the more that the American people are put off, and the more likely President Trump is re-elected,\u201d Nunes added.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. weighed in on D.C. statehood during a Thursday hearing on the issue and discussed the \"disenfranchisement\" of the District's people as rooted in the \"history of slavery.\" She opened her statement by talking about her family's roots in Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory, and how her family had lacked the right to vote in federal elections. \"I wish that upon no citizen of the United States of America,\" she said. \"Where the disenfranchisement of Puerto Ricans was rooted in the colonialist and imperialistic history that we've had in policies of the United States, the issue of D.C. statehood is\u00a0rooted in a different evil in our history, which is the history of slavery in the United States,\u201d she added. Ocasio-Cortez cited the disenfranchisement of the\u00a0majority-minority city as \"upholding the injustice of the practices enacted during slavery.\" \"It is a profound injustice and a thick irony of our history that the people who fled here to the District of Columbia to free slavery because of the enlightenment of this community are now disenfranchised,\" she said, observing that the District was the first part of the Union to emancipate slaves. The hearing before the House Committee on Oversight and Reform was to debate a D.C. statehood\u00a0bill, aptly named \"H.R. 51,\" in the first House of Representatives hearing on statehood since 1993. How does statehood work?: Will DC become the 51st state?

Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., asked about its fate. D.C. Mayor Muriel\u00a0Bowser told him that all hotels would be included in the new state. The question drew derision from Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., who joked that the hotel was the \"Washington Monument.\" \"It's amazing to me that the political rights of 700,000 people might be conditioned on the business interests of one man,\" said Rep.

The 2020 presidential hopeful felt chest discomfort during a campaign event in Las Vegas last week and had a blockage in one artery.

His doctors said Sanders\u2019 \u201chospital course was uneventful with good expected progress.\u201d Sanders, 78, was seen walking about his neighborhood in Burlington, Vermont, with his wife, Jane, Monday, and told reporters he'd be back on the campaign trail \"soon.\"\u00a0He said on Sunday\u00a0that he was \u201cglad to be home in Burlington to rest for a little bit\u201d and is \u201crecovering well and feeling much better.\u201d Sanders will participate in the upcoming Democratic primary debate,\u00a0his campaign\u00a0confirmed to USA TODAY last week. But he has cancelled some other campaign events since his heart attack. CNN and LGBTQ advocacy group the Human Rights Campaign announced at the end of CNN's 7-hour forum\u00a0on climate change that they would be partnering to host the Thursday town hall. The event\u00a0focused on LGBT issues comes after Trump administration policies that have\u00a0banned\u00a0transgender Americans from serving in the military,\u00a0prohibited\u00a0embassies from flying rainbow flags during Pride Month and\u00a0rolled\u00a0back\u00a0certain Obama-era nondiscrimination protections.

He currently stands in third place in national polling, according to a Real Clear Politics' averaging of major polls. The Vermont senator\u2019s health scare has brought age to the forefront of the 2020 race. Sanders is the oldest person running for President.

In the answer that followed, Zuckerberg \u2013 who,\u00a0with a net worth of $67 billion,\u00a0is listed by Forbes as the fourth wealthiest American\u00a0\u2013 said he was sympathetic to Sanders' views on income inequality. \"I understand where he's coming from,\" he said, noting he couldn't put a threshold on how much wealth is too much. \"At some level, no one deserves to have that much money.\" He went on to say he sees potential advantages to some\u00a0Americans' ability to accumulate even \"unreasonable\" amounts of wealth, too. Forbes 400: Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates and Warren Buffett remain the richest people in the US Facebook encryption: Here's why the government doesn't want Facebook to encrypt your messages He cited his own philanthropic pledges as an example:\u00a0Zuckerberg and wife Dr. Priscilla Chan have pledged to give away 99% of their Facebook shares in their lifetime. Zuckerberg said that while critics might argue billionaires' charitable gifts would benefit the nation more as tax dollars,\u00a0he says his philanthropy is funding scientific research projects that would likely be ignored by the government. \"I think the alternative would be the government chooses all of the funding for all of the stuff,\" he commented. \"Part of what makes progress happen is people taking different approaches to different things,\" he went on to say. The exchange happened at a weekly\u00a0\"internal Q&A\" that was publicly\u00a0live-streamed on\u00a0Zuckerberg's Facebook page. Usually the sessions are only for employees but a\u00a0previous Q&A session made headlines this week when Zuckerberg was heard saying in leaked audio\u00a0that he would\u00a0\"go to the mat\" to fight efforts aimed at breaking up the social networking giant. That sparked a response from another Democratic presidential hopeful: Sen.\u00a0Elizabeth Warren, who defended her plan to break up big tech companies. Zuckerberg was asked Thursday about Warren's plans and responded: \"Let's try not to antagonize her further.\" On Friday, Warren tweeted a video clip of the question and the start of Zuckerberg's response. \"If Facebook finds my scrutiny uncomfortable, here's what Mark Zuckerberg and his team could work on,\" Warren tweeted, listing\u00a0protecting consumers' privacy, ensuring Facebook \"isn\u2019t undermining our election security\" and ending \"his company's illegal anticompetitive practices.\" Contributing: Kelly Tyko, Jessica Guynn,\u00a0Brett Molina",

            "content": " DES MOINES \u2014 Sen. Bernie Sanders canceled several planned Iowa events to recover from a heart attack, but\u00a0his Iowa campaign staff are\u00a0moving forward\u00a0with or without him on the stump. Sanders, who was hospitalized the night of Oct. 1 to have two stents inserted to clear blockages in his heart, has no current plans to return to Iowa. His only public event scheduled now is Tuesday's televised debate in Ohio. Tuesday evening,\u00a0he\u00a0told reporters\u00a0assembled outside of his home in Burlington, Vermont, that he's going to \"change the nature of the campaign a bit, and make sure I have the strength to do what I need to do.\" The Democratic presidential candidate told\u00a0NBC News on Wednesday he plans to \"get back into the groove of a very vigorous campaign,\" albeit one where \"I want to start off slower and build up and build up and build up.\" What that means for Sanders' Iowa campaign strategy wasn't immediately clear. Sanders\u00a0canceled one Iowa swing immediately after he was hospitalized\u00a0and a second appearance at an Iowa labor forum,\u00a0planned for Oct. 13. Sanders is slated to participate in a Des Moines forum on issues important to Latino voters on Oct. 24, but his\u00a0campaign staff couldn't confirm if that would happen. Before his heart attack, when Sanders would campaign\u00a0through Iowa, he'd pack his schedule with town halls, forums and rallies. At the end of September, his most recent visit, he held\u00a011 public events over four days, starting in Des Moines before moving from north-central Iowa down to its southeast corner. During those four days, he also\u00a0included two events in Oklahoma. The heart attack\u00a0led the campaign to delay a $1.3 million ad buy on Iowa TV markets. The two-week buy launched Tuesday, four days after it initially planned to air,\u00a0campaign spokesperson Bill Neidhardt said. The Iowa campaign hasn't stopped, however.\u00a0In early October, the campaign's national co-chair, U.S. Rep. Ro Khanna of California, traveled across Iowa\u00a0as volunteers canvassed neighborhoods and worked phonebanks. \"We began this campaign with the intent to win Iowa, and we continue to intend to win Iowa,\" Neidhardt said. Iowa tends to see fewer presidential candidates in the days\u00a0leading up to televised Democratic debates, so Sanders' absence does not stand out as much as it would during other stretches. The Des Moines Register's candidate event tracker showed a bare schedule\u00a0wrapping up October among all candidates. Sanders, so far, has held the most public events in Iowa among\u00a0the top-polling candidates. Among candidates with more than 1% support in the latest\u00a0Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll, only U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who has held 85 events, has had more Iowa stops than Sanders. Sanders has held 76 Iowa events this cycle. But campaigns tend to come to Iowa more frequently in the fall and winter leading up to the February caucuses.\u00a0U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris in particular has said she plans to focus on the first-in-the-nation nominating contest to prove her mettle as a candidate. She was in Iowa the first weekend of October and will be back next weekend. Sam Roecker, a Democratic strategist and consultant, said Sanders' absence from the campaign trail likely won't hurt him as much as it would a lesser-known candidate. But Sanders will need to keep his name in the national conversation and pivot focus\u00a0away from concerns of his health and fitness for the job. \"It's up in the air,\" Roecker said.\u00a0\"We're still at that point where people haven't made up their mind on who they're going to caucus for.\" But Sanders' health scare has not dissuaded his most fervent supporters. Alyssa Rooney, a 25-year-old social worker in Waterloo, has supported Sanders since the 2016 race. She points to his demanding schedule, routine of walks and basketball, and general vigor during campaign stops as evidence of overall physical fitness. \"People have health issues all the time,\" Rooney said in an interview.\u00a0\"Young people have health issues. For me, I read that he had this health scare but he was OK. For me, that was the end of it. It happened, but he can move on from it. \"I still believe he's the best person for the job.\"",

The editorial caught the attention of local and national news outlets. The Washington Post wrote a piece about how the student's turned\u00a0their travails into the story. In the students' piece, \"No Seat at the Roundtable,\" the \u00a0newspaper's\u00a0two editor-in-chiefs\u00a0said they were waved away the morning of April 17 when an event bouncer learned they hadn't RSVP'd to the event.

Beyond their own problems attempting to enter the event, the students questioned the 11 a.m. Wednesday timing of the event, saying it's an inconvenient time for teachers and students to attend. The editorial questioned why only one student, who attends a private school in Louisville, had a seat at the table. \"... As students, we are the ones who are going to be affected by the\u00a0proposed changes discussed\u00a0at the roundtable, yet we were not allowed inside,\" the students, Olivia Doyle and Abigail Wheatley, wrote.

A media advisory on the education department's website included press contacts and noted\u00a0reporters needed to have RSVP'd for the event by 8 a.m. on the day of the events. The students say they\u00a0learned of DeVos' visit the day before and started making plans to attend. But when they arrived at the public school campus for the event they knew was open to reporters, the students said, a\u00a0man wearing a college badge told them they needed an invitation to attend. The Lexington Herald-Leader\u00a0reported\u00a0that U.S. Department of Education Press Secretary Liz Hill said no one on DeVos' staff knew that student journalists were trying to get into the event. \"We welcome student journalists and would have been happy for them to be in attendance,\" she said. \"We are looking into what, if any, miscommunication might have happened between other staff on site for the event.\u201d Follow Matthew Glowicki on Twitter:\u00a0@MattGlo ",

That\u2019s a freedom philosophy.\" For DeVos, a wealthy former Michigan Republican Party chairwoman whose Cabinet term has been marked with controversy, that means giving students and families the choice to move between schools. She says this will force traditional public schools to innovate and get better. Betsy DeVos roundtable: High school journalists were blocked from Betsy DeVos event. So, they wrote about it What we know: Betsy DeVos wants to cut Special Olympics funds and people are outraged It's a familiar mantra for DeVos, who pushed the establishment of charter schools in Michigan and helped to push an unsuccessful school vouchers ballot question in Michigan. She has proposed an Education Freedom Scholarship, which would use private scholarships to allow students who couldn't normally afford it to go to private schools. It ties in with DeVos' broader philosophy. \"Let\u2019s stop and rethink the definition of public education,\" she said. \"Today, it\u2019s often defined as one type of school, funded by taxpayers, controlled by government. But if every student is part of 'the public,'\u00a0then every way and every place a student learns is ultimately of benefit to 'the public.'\u00a0That should be the new definition of public education.\" DeVos furthered her push for school choice under questioning from New York Times reporter Erica Greene. \"More choices and more freedom in education will ultimately mean\u00a0better schools overall, even a neighborhood traditional public schools,\" DeVos said. \"Having the ability to direct where resources go on the child or family level helps families become wise consumers.\" During the question-and-answer period with the reporters, a Michigan-based reporter asked DeVos about Detroit schools and the charter schools in the city, which have a generally poor record, as does the Detroit traditional school system and why DeVos hadn't visited the city to talk to families about the schools. DeVos was instrumental in pushing Michigan's charter school law, including through political action groups and donations to Michigan legislators. DeVos said she had been to Detroit schools before she was Education secretary. She also said she doesn't think Michigan has true education \"freedom.\" She added that she hoped that would change.

DeVos said all public schools \u2014 charter and traditional \u2014 must follow laws, but said the bigger thing to focus on is why there are waiting lists in many places for charter schools and why more of those schools aren't available.

Now, gang members will stand trial CPS failed to respond promptly and equitably to complaints;\u00a0did not provide services and remedies to the complainants;\u00a0did not notify the complainants of investigation outcomes;\u00a0and did not take effective action to provide a safe environment for all students, according to a DOE press release. The probe noted that the district did not have a Title IX coordinator from 1999 to December 2018\u00a0and that the coordinators who followed did not have\u00a0full authority to carry out their responsibilities, among other concerns. Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in education programs and activities that receive federal funds, obliging schools districts like CPS\u00a0to respond promptly and equitably to allegations of sex-based harassment. \"The Chicago Public Schools have inexcusably failed, for quite some time, to provide their students with the basic protections required by law. I am glad that CPS has now agreed to make a number of serious, substantive changes to come into compliance with Title IX,\"\u00a0said Kenneth L. Marcus,\u00a0assistant secretary for civil rights, in the Department of Education news release. Click here to read more about the investigation. The investigation began\u00a0in 2015 but grew in 2018 after the Chicago Tribune documented more than 500 police reports of sexual assault or abuse of a child inside a Chicago public school during the prior decade. District CEO Dr. Janice K. Jackson addressed the findings in a letter to the CPS community\u00a0Thursday. \"While we have made significant progress, we will not be satisfied until I and every CPS parent believes we have created a safe and supportive district culture,\" Jackson wrote. Jackson noted in the letter that CPS began\u00a0addressing many of the investigation's findings\u00a0in June\u00a02018, when the district\u00a0implemented\u00a0a Comprehensive Plan of Action to bolster protections of\u00a0students. The plan strengthened the district's\u00a0Title IX procedures. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos promised accountability\u00a0Thursday. \"The failures of Chicago Public Schools were widespread, glaring & heartbreaking. Too many innocent students suffered because adults didn\u2019t do their jobs. We will continue to ensure every student can learn in a safe environment & hold schools accountable,\" DeVos said in a Tweet. The Office of Civil Rights is\u00a0requiring CPS to: The Office of Civil Rights has given CPS\u00a0a Nov.\u00a027, 2019, deadline to submit documents demonstrating that the district has made required structural changes.

            "content": " WASHINGTON \u2014 In a letter sent to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos on Friday evening, 51 attorneys general called on the Education Secretary to automatically cancel disabled veterans' student debt, something that is not currently done by the Department of Education. \"We write to...urge the Department of Education to take prompt action to satisfy its statutory mandate to discharge the student loans of veterans who are permanently and totally disabled or otherwise unemployable,\" wrote the attorneys general.\u00a0\"As a nation, we have a moral obligation to assist those who have put their lives on the line to defend us.\" The group included attorneys general from 47 states, three territories, and the District of Columbia. Alabama, Arizona, and Texas did not sign on. More: Buttigieg's huge student debt Three fast facts: Robert F. Smith gift to Morehouse highlights burden of student loan debt In April last year, DeVos announced a new partnership between the Departments of Education and Veterans Affairs that would match borrowers in the Department of Education's records system with disabled veterans in the Department of Veterans Affairs records system. People deemed eligible for loan discharges would be mailed a letter including an\u00a0application for \"totally and permanently disabled\" (TPD) status.\u00a0Under the Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008, if student borrowers die or become permanently disabled, they are eligible to have their loans forgiven, so a successful granting of TPD status would allow for the complete discharge of student loans. The attorneys general argued that automatically canceling the student debt would benefit veterans\u00a0whose\u00a0severe disabilities might prevent them from filling out the necessary forms. Like what you\u2019re reading?: Download the USA TODAY app for more Education Department spokesperson Liz Hill told Politico that \u201cwhile \u2018automatic discharge\u2019 may seem like a simple solution, there are long-term impacts we want all veterans to have the chance to consider before their loans are discharged.\u201d Hill also cited \"potential state and local tax liabilities\" that could burden veterans after their loans were forgiven and veterans' potential inability to take out other student loans in the future if their current ones were forgiven. Anticipating this criticism, the attorneys general wrote that \"we think it likely that most borrowers would prefer to have one hundred percent of their outstanding loans discharged, even if this resulted in an increase to their state tax bill,\" though they considered adding a way to opt out of the automatic loan forgiveness. According to a FOIA request filed by Veterans Education Succes, an advocacy group,\u00a0with the Department of Education, more than\u00a042,000 veterans\u00a0are eligible for TPD status, but fewer than\u00a09,000 people had applied as of the beginning of May 2018, More than\u00a025,000 eligible veterans were in default.",

            "content": " WASHINGTON \u2013 The U.S. Department of Education issued new rules late Friday that could make it more difficult for students to get federal loan forgiveness \u00a0if they attended colleges that close suddenly. The rules,\u00a0which have been known as \"borrower defense,\"\u00a0have been the subject of controversy for much of Betsy DeVos\u2019 turn as education secretary. She has long sought to overturn the 2016 rules from former President Barack\u00a0Obama's administration on the grounds that it was too easy for students to seek loan forgiveness. The new rules would require student borrowers to provide more evidence that they had been misled about the college\u2019s outlook and, as a result, can\u2019t find employment.\u00a0It also shifts more of the responsibility onto students to vet the colleges they attend. \u201cI called for this regulatory reset more than two years ago, as it became clear the old rules just weren\u2019t working,\u201d DeVos said in a news release. \u201cWe believe this final rule corrects the wrongs of the 2016 rule through common sense and carefully crafted reforms that hold colleges and universities accountable and treat students and taxpayers fairly.\u201d The new rules apply to loans issued on or after July 1, 2020. The department said the changes would save roughly $11 billion over the next decade \u2013 in part because the feds would forgive fewer loans. DeVos is pushing the changes while the\u00a0national discussion about student loans has never been louder. The nation has about $1.6 trillion in student loan debt, and several Democratic presidential hopefuls have rolled out\u00a0student loan forgiveness into their platforms. One plan:How much does Warren's debt forgiveness plan cost? A lot. Upping the stakes:\u00a0What's different about Bernie Sanders' student loan plan? It would help more rich people Critics were quick to voice their concerns on Friday, warning\u00a0borrowers might struggle to get the Education Department to agree to forgive their loans.\u00a0The Project on Predatory Student Lending went so far as to say it would have to sue to prevent the rules from taking effect. The department argued the new rules would save taxpayer money while still protecting those who might have been genuinely defrauded. The department also said the new rules discourage borrowers from making false claims in an attempt to game the system. Among the many changes in the 846-page document, borrowers now must apply for loan forgiveness if their college closes suddenly. Before, they were automatically eligible for forgiveness. (The window for applying for forgiveness after a school closes\u00a0has been extended to 180 days instead of\u00a0the prior 120.) Groups of people \u2013 such as whole classes at a college that\u2019s closing \u2013 no longer can file for forgiveness, as they had been able to in the past. Borrowers will also have to provide evidence they searched for a job, including emails that would confirm they had applied for work or attended a career fair. A version of the\u00a0borrower-defense rules had been in place since 1995, but they weren\u2019t widely used until 2015. That\u2019s about the same time the for-profit Corinthians College closed abruptly, leaving thousands of students with millions in debt. The DeVos department has argued the Obama administration expanded the rules to serve these students. As of March 2019, roughly 180,000 applications\u00a0for debt forgiveness were awaiting approval, despite court rulings in 2018 ordering the department to act. DeVos has spent much of her time as education secretary focusing on school choice for children. Her emphasis in the higher education sector has been reducing regulations. Critics have said these moves disproportionately benefit for-profit colleges. Earlier this summer, DeVos\u2019 department repealed a rule that would have barred federal money to institutions that burden their graduates with high levels of debt compared with their actual earnings. DeVos has also pushed to loosen the federal rules surrounding college accreditation. The department argued less bureaucratic rigmarole will mean colleges can more quickly place students in high-demand jobs, while critics have said laxer standards could leave students more indebted with worthless degrees. For-profits have attracted close public scrutiny in recent years due to the high-profile and sudden closure of several institutions. In addition to Corinithians, ITT closed in 2016 and the Education Corp. of America\u2019s 75 campuses shut their doors in 2018. Most recently, Argosy University closed earlier this year, leaving thousands of students in the lurch.

            "content": "When it comes to doing things, Elizabeth Warren has a plan for everything \u2014 and she\u2019s happy to tell you all about it. But when it comes to paying for things, I'm sorry to say, the Massachusetts senator\u00a0dodges and deflects like a Donald Trump defender. It\u2019s estimated that \"Medicare for All\" will cost the federal government an extra $3 trillion a year.\u00a0That\u2019s more than $9,000 annually from every man, woman and child in America.\u00a0Despite being asked, again and again, Warren refuses to acknowledge that paying for this is going to require an across-the-board tax increase\u00a0\u2014 and a pretty massive one, at that. Instead, she keep talking about how \u201ccosts\u201d will go down\u00a0before she changes the subject to how stressful it is to have your insurance canceled when you get sick or when you have to cope with your mom having diabetes. That\u2019s very true, I\u2019m sure. But we\u2019re talking fiscal policy here. There\u2019s a very unpleasant collectivist feel to this. It\u2019s all very well to say you can\u2019t make an omelet\u00a0without breaking some eggs \u2026 unless you\u2019re the egg. About\u00a056% of Americans \u2014 more than 180 million \u2014\u00a0have private health insurance through an employer. Medicare for All would sweep that all away, whether the people who have that insurance like it or not, in the name of the common good. Perhaps worse, as Warren knows perfectly well but steadfastly refuses to admit, there are going to be winners and losers. Costs might\u00a0go down in the aggregate, but individuals and families aren\u2019t aggregates. Elizabeth Warren's choice:\u00a0'Medicare for All' purity or a path to beating Trump? For example, Warren keeps saying that the total you pay for health care would end up being less under Medicare for All because it will eliminate out-of-pocket costs like premiums and copays. That\u2019s an oversimplification at best, especially since she hasn\u2019t said how she would finance this enormously expensive project. But it is a given that everyone will pay higher taxes, and it\u2019s older people who spend more in premiums and out-of-pocket health care costs \u2014 a lot more. Consequently, older people will be far more likely to see these higher taxes offset by a decrease in the cost of their health care. By contrast, younger people and families at healthier stages of their lives would still be paying new taxes\u00a0but will see fewer benefits. On average, would people be better off with lower taxes and more disposable income to buy a home, invest, or raise a family when they were younger and then absorb higher health care costs when they are older? Or would they be better off forgoing that income and avoiding those health care costs later? I don\u2019t know, and neither does Sen.\u00a0Warren. But this is exactly the kind of thing we need to have an open and honest debate about. Warren is treating the American public like children and insisting that she knows best. This is foolish in the extreme. Even if she doesn\u2019t want to discuss the costs and trade-offs of Medicare for All, she can be sure that, should she become the Democratic nominee, the Republicans will do it for her. Her refusal to admit the obvious makes her look dishonest. Doing it wrong: 2020 Democrats, stop arguing about health care and show leadership. Medicare for All is not a good idea. It\u2019s just an idea. It\u2019s up to the American people, after considering the pros and cons \u2014 which, yes, do include much higher taxes for everyone \u2014 to decide whether, on balance, the trade-offs make it worthwhile or whether something else, like an expanded and fortified Obamacare or a public insurance option, would be better. Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, is exactly correct when he says that Americans want choices,\u00a0and that we should trust them to make the right decisions for themselves, for their families \u2014 and for the country. You do that by being straight with them. There are\u00a0many possible paths to beating Donald Trump in 2020, but I can guarantee you that trying to out-spin and out-dodge him is not one of them.

            "content": " WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2013One of\u00a0President Donald Trump's many efforts to crack down on asylum-seekers at the border is headed to the Supreme Court. The justices agreed Friday\u00a0to consider the administration's effort to speed the removal of thousands of migrants without allowing them federal court hearings. A federal appeals court in California ruled earlier this year that efforts to remove asylum-seekers under \"expedited review\" procedures\u00a0violated their constitutional rights. The Justice Department argues that extending the streamlined process could add years of court wrangling. The case is one of several challenging the Trump administration's efforts to crack down on migrants seeking asylum after crossing the Mexican border: \u2022 In December, the Supreme Court temporarily blocked a policy aimed at denying asylum to migrants crossing the border illegally rather than at designated crossings. \u2022 Last month, the justices temporarily upheld a different policy denying asylum to those who do\u00a0not seek\u00a0protection first from a country they pass\u00a0through, such as Mexico. The high court already has a major immigration case on its plate this year. In November, it will hear the administration's argument for ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program created in 2012 by President Barack Obama. The case granted Friday\u00a0concerns a citizen of Sri Lanka who crossed the border illegally and was apprehended immediately by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. He said he feared returning to his native country, but those claims were deemed to be unfounded in immigration court. Congress in 1996 created the expedited review system in which thousands of undocumented immigrants\u00a0are removed each year, often within days of arrival. But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th\u00a0Circuit declared the\u00a0truncated system unconstitutional. The Justice Department argues in court papers that the 9th Circuit's ruling will \"significantly\u00a0delay removal of aliens ...\u00a0undermining the government\u2019s ability to control the border.\" After losing the case, the administration in July expanded the expedited removal system to incorporate asylum-seekers apprehended anywhere in the country who have not been continuously present in the United States for two years. The American Civil Liberties Union, representing the Sri Lankan asylum-seeker, had urged the justices to reject the administration's appeal \"so that the political branches are not entirely unchecked when they deprive individuals of liberty.\"",

            "content": " DALLAS \u2013 In the political heart of Texas, a state Republicans have dominated for decades, Democrats say they are gaining ground \u2013 and one of the reasons rode into\u00a0Dallas-Fort Worth on Thursday. His name:\u00a0Donald Trump. While Trump's policies on immigration, trade and the economy\u00a0remain popular in Republican-leaning Texas, Democrats say the president's actions are helping them build a base of their own among\u00a0Hispanics, city dwellers and college-education professionals in the Lone Star State. \"Texas Democrats are rising,\" Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins said as Trump supporters gathered for a rally at a sports arena in downtown Dallas. He added, \"once Texas\u00a0turns blue, the White House will follow for a long time.\" At the rally later in the evening, Trump scoffed at the notion that the Lone Star State is somehow in play, telling supporters: \"Donald Trump is not going to lose Texas, I can tell you that.\" 'Don't kid yourself': Donald Trump tells Dallas rally the fate of democracy is at stake in 2020 Indeed, the president is still favored to carry Texas in the 2020 election \u2013 he won it by nine percentage points in 2016. But members of both parties said Democrats are in a position to make it more of a challenge. And while Texas Democrats haven't won a statewide race since 1994, they nearly captured a Senate seat last year and are closing the gap in legislative and congressional elections. \"It's fair to say the state is more competitive than it has been, and the threat is real,\" said Texas-based Republican political consultant Matt Mackowiak, though he added: \"I do not think it will be in play\u00a0in the presidential race.\" Trump supporters could not be more confident about Texas, noting that the state\u00a0has seen increases in job creation and energy production since Trump took office, while Democrats are promoting \"socialist\" ideas on health care and gun control. \"There are too many people who feel the way I do\" in Texas, said Brenda Lewis, 72, a Fort Worth retiree who grabbed a front-row seat at the rally.\u00a0\"They don't want to change it to Cuba.\" Trump didn't\u00a0visit\u00a0Texas on Thursday because he's worried about losing the state, aides said. From Texarkana to El Paso, the state is a giant ATM for presidential candidates in both parties, and Trump began his day by raising an estimated $5.5 million at fundraisers\u00a0in Fort Worth. Trump then headed to nearby Johnson County to\u00a0help cut the ribbon at a new Louis Vuitton leather manufacturing workshop, an appearance in which he\u00a0highlighted plans to make\u00a0jobs a major\u00a0campaign issue. What to know from a busy Thursday: Trump's Syria-Turkey cease-fire, Rick Perry resigns, the death of Elijah Cummings As he did at rallies last week in Minnesota and Louisiana, Trump used his Texas gig to buck up his base as he faces numerous challenges back in Washington, D.C.\u00a0\u2013 most notably an impeachment inquiry\u00a0led by House Democrats. Trump and his Texas supporters predicted that a backlash against impeachment will help Trump. \"People like us will come out in force,\" said Sandra Brewer, 52, a flight attendant from Granbury, Tex. Standing outside American Airlines Center hours before the rally, Brewer added that \"President Trump goes through so much day after day. Most people would have been crushed by now. But he keeps going and going.\" Democrats and some political scientists have talked about it for years: An emerging \"Blue Texas,\" the color that television news networks use to identify states that go Democratic in presidential elections. Proponents cite major demographic shifts in one of the nation's fastest growing states. Much of that growth is in Hispanic communities and the big city areas of Dallas, Houston, Austin\u00a0and San Antonio; Democrats said\u00a0many of these new Texas residents are voting with them. \"All of our new voters are going Democratic by a ratio of 5-to-1,\" said Ed Espinoza, executive director of a political organization called Progress Texas. More: Can Democrats win Texas? Houston debate put Lone Star politics at the forefront Trump is a trigger for many of these voters, according to state Democrats. His efforts to crack down on immigration are alienating Hispanic voters; his\u00a0aggressive style, including attacks on allies and lawmakers of color, turn off many suburbanites, particularly women. \"Trump is a huge liability for the Republican Party,\" said Brittany Switzer, a spokesperson for the Texas Democratic Party.\u00a0One result, she said,\u00a0is \"we see a huge coalition and we're looking to build that coalition.\" Republicans said the demographic argument is overstated. There are many conservative Hispanic people, they said, and GOP candidates in Texas can\u00a0get a fair share of their votes; same with the growing suburbs. Still, there is Republican concern that manifested itself in a high-profile Senate race just last year. Supporters from around Texas, along with throngs of street vendors from all over the country who hop from Trump rally to Trump rally, began arriving at the 20,000-seat American Airlines Center around daybreak. By noon, the lines with a dozen or more people standing abreast filled about four city blocks north of downtown. The crowd at the arena's northeast side was entertained by a talk show-style political program produced by the Trump campaign. A live band that covered such singles as Merle Haggard's \"Mama Tried,\" Pink Floyd's \"The Wall\" and \"The Joker\" by the Steve Miller Band kept the burgeoning crowd entertained. During the performance of \"The Wall,\" the line stating \"we don't need no thought control\" was changed to \"we don't need no gun control.\" Franklin Hughes, a vendor from South Carolina attending his 30th rally, said business was steady despite the competition. The talk of impeachment in the nation's capital has done nothing but improve sales, he said. \"It isn't hurting my business one bit,\" Franklin said. \"It's making it better.\" O'Rourke, a former House member, did not defeat the first-term incumbent Sen. Ted\u00a0Cruz \u2013 but he came as close to winning as any Texas-wide Democratic candidate has in a quarter-century. While\u00a0Cruz won 50.9% to 48.3%, some analysts\u00a0said the race foreshadowed the emerging and more politically competitive Texas. O'Rourke raised around $80 million and activated hundreds of thousands of new voters, particularly in the growing urban areas. O'Rourke certainly sees it as a sign of the future. In seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, he claims he could carry Texas and its 38 electoral votes, foreclosing Trump's hopes to victory nationwide. After Trump announced his rally in Dallas, O'Rourke scheduled a counter-rally Thursday evening in nearby Grand Prairie. He called it a \"rally against fear.\" Cruz also sees a changing Texas. In September, he told a group of reporters that suburban voters, particularly women, are \"moving left,\" and \"that\u2019s turning states with big suburban populations \u2013\u00a0states like Texas, states like Georgia, states like Arizona \u2013\u00a0much more purple.\u201d Referring to fellow Republicans, Cruz said: \"If we lose Texas, it\u2019s game over.\u201d Beto O'Rourke: Bill O'Reilly's Twitter attack on Beto O'Rourke backfires Texas Republicans say they don't see a Democratic state anytime soon.\u00a0Some called 2018 an anomaly, in part because Cruz was relatively unpopular among other Republicans. GOP members noted that the incumbent governor, Greg Abbott, won his reelection easily. O'Rourke's fundraising would be hard for a presidential candidate to duplicate, they said. It's questionable as to whether the Democrats would\u00a0be willing to spend that kind of money on a presidential race in Texas, and might to want to spread it to more competitive states. Said Mackowiak: \"2018 was a very weird year in Texas.\" As for 2020, Texas Republicans noted that Trump did win by 9 percentage points in\u00a0 2016, and a reversal of that size is hard to imagine. Steve Munisteri, a former GOP state chairman in Texas, said it all boils down to numbers. Generally, in recent elections, statewide Republican candidates get around 4.5 million votes, he said; Democrat candidates have a base of around 4 million. 'I guess I'm the Meryl Streep of general: Ex-Defense Sec. Jim Mattis jokes after Trump's insult Given the state's growth, Munisteri's\u00a0new target is 5.5 million voters. And, as usual, it will boil down to whichever party can turn out that many votes. \"If the Republicans don't get out their vote, and the Democrats do turn out their vote, the Democrats can win a statewide race,\" he said. It doesn't look like the Alamo for either party; Munisteri said getting out all those new voters in future elections is more like another battle. \"It's going to be like the western front in World War I,\" Munisteri said. \"Trench warfare.\" At the rally in Dallas, Trump backers predicted an easy win next year, though some were less certain about the future. They acknowledged that Democrats are coming on in the state. \"Maybe in 2024, later on down the line,\" said Heather Box, 43, a \"lifelong Texan\" and \"lifelong Republican\" who lives in Addison, Texas, near Dallas. \"I just don't think it's going to happen now. There's just not enough of them yet.\" Contributing: John C Moritz Austin Bureau USA TODAY NETWORK, Corpus Christi Caller-Times",

A new Suffolk\u00a0University/USA TODAY Network\u00a0Poll, taken after this month's Democratic debate, shows Biden at 23% and Warren at 19% in Nevada, the state that follows Iowa and New Hampshire in the opening presidential contests next year.\u00a0Bernie Sanders is at 14%. While Warren trailed\u00a0Biden, the Massachusetts senator was\u00a0within the margin of error of the former vice president for the first time in a public poll in the Silver State. It is the second poll in recent days to show her gaining on Biden in a key state:\u00a0She also has surged in Iowa, edging ahead of Biden in a Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll released over the weekend. \"Nevada was Elizabeth Warren's weakest early state but this finding is validation that Warren has reached an important inflection point,\" said David Paleologos, director of the Suffolk Political Research Center. \"The Democratic nomination could now become a two-person race between Warren and Joe Biden, as she is positioning herself for a first or second place finish in the first three Democratic contests.\" Among the second tier of candidates in Nevada, California Sen. Kamala Harris was at 4%\u00a0and South Bend (Ind.) Mayor Pete Buttigieg, entrepreneur Andrew Yang and activist Tom Steyer at 3%. The poll of 500 likely Democratic caucus-goers, taken by landline and cell phone Sept. 19-23, has a margin of error of 4.4 percentage points. Issues in Nevada:: Poll respondents said top issues are health care, climate change. The race remains fluid. Nearly six in 10 of those surveyed, 58%, said they might change their mind before the caucuses, scheduled for February. Just 37% said their minds were \"firmly made up.\" The survey showed Warren positioned to increase her support as the Democratic field narrows. She was the \"second choice\"\u00a0of 19%, compared to 16% for Biden, 12% for Sanders and 10% for California Sen. Kamala Harris. Warren insists it's too early to pay much attention to polls. \"I don't do polls,\" she told reporters when asked about the Iowa Poll. \"We are still months away from the Iowa caucuses and the first primary election.\" Let's vote: When are the 2020 presidential election primaries? In national polls, Biden continues to have a durable lead among Democratic voters, now at 30% in the RealClearPolitics average of September surveys. Warren has moved into second place, at 19%, three points ahead of Sanders.\u00a0In New Hampshire, which holds the first presidential primary, the top three contenders are bunched within a few points of one another. Biden continues to have a yawning lead in South Carolina, which holds its contest a week after Nevada. National look: USA TODAY/Suffolk poll: Americans dread the 2020 election Nevada Democrats, like those across the country, care more about electability than ideology. By 20 points, 58%-38%, they said the most important thing for Democrats was to nominate a candidate who can defeat President Trump, rather than a candidate \"who reflects my priorities and values.\" Warren was boosted by her performance in the Democratic debate this month, the third of the series. Among those who watched the forum, she was the candidate most often cited as one who did better than they expected, by 23%. Biden was the candidate most often cited as one who did worse than they expected, at 22%. That could raise the stakes for both candidates in the next debate, slated for Oct. 15 and 16 on the campus of Otterbein University near Columbus, Ohio. And the spate of good news for Warren could carry a cost: Her\u00a0rise could well make her the target for her Democratic rivals on stage.",

            "content": " White House hopeful Elizabeth Warren wants to impose a massive tax on lobbying activities, creating a new levy that she hopes will nudge some of the nation\u2019s biggest companies and special interest groups toward curtailing federal lobbying. \u201cMy new lobbying tax will make hiring armies of lobbyists significantly more expensive for the largest corporate influencers like Blue Cross Blue Shield, Boeing, and Comcast,\u201d Warren said. \u201cSure, this may mean that some corporations and industry groups will choose to reduce their lobbying expenditures, raising less tax revenue down the road \u2013 but in that case, all the better.\u201d The proposal might face long odds\u00a0\u2014 a seeming longshot in a divided Congress in which both sides of the aisle have deep ties to lobbyists \u2014 \u00a0but it marks Warren\u2019s latest effort to press her case to voters that she\u2019s the candidate most in tune with looking out for working-class\u00a0Americans. It also comes amidst growing angst in tech and financial sectors about her growing popularity in polls Under the the Massachusetts senator's\u00a0legislative proposal, companies that spend between $500,000 and $1 million per year on lobbying Congress and federal agencies would pay a 35% tax on those expenditures. For every dollar above $1 million spent on lobbying, the rate will increase to 60% \u2013 and for every dollar above $5 million, it would increase to 75%, Warren explained in a Medium post.\u00a0Under data compiled from the Center for Responsive Politics, Warren\u2019s proposal\u00a0would have resulted in companies such as Koch Industries, Pfizer, Boeing, Microsoft, Walmart, and Exxon being subject to the 75% rate for lobbying spending above $5 million in every year over the last decade. Warren\u00a0in March unveiled a plan  that called for regulators to roll back big tech mergers such as Amazon acquiring Whole Foods and Facebook purchasing the messaging platform WhatsApp and Instagram. Warren then\u00a0slammed Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg Tuesday after The Verge published leaked audio in which he lamented that if Warren were elected president Facebook would find itself caught in a legal battle with U.S. government. \"If she gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge,\" Zuckerberg said in the audio that was among snippets from two meetings held with Facebook employees in July. \"And does that still suck for us? Yeah.\" Big tech clash: Warren hits back at Facebook's Zuckerberg after he criticized her plan to break up big tech More: Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders slam Big Tech but their campaigns spend heavily on them She took to Twitter last week to push back against a CNBC report citing anonymous Democratic Wall Street donors who told the financial network they would sit out the election or support Trump in Warren becomes the nominee. \u201cI'm fighting for an economy and a government that works for all of us, not just the wealthy and well-connected,\u201d Warren tweeted. \u201cI'm not afraid of anonymous quotes, and wealthy donors don't get to buy this process. I won't back down from fighting for the big, structural change we need.\u201d Warren has steadily climbed in the polls. She hovered in the single-digit percentages in most national and early voting states\u2019 polls early in the year. Two recent polls \u2014 one in the first-in-the-nation caucus state of Iowa and a national survey of voters \u2014 found her slightly ahead of former Vice President Joe Biden. Warren says revenue generated by her lobbying tax would be poured into a \u201cLobby Defense Trust Fund\u201d that would be used to reinstate the dormant Office of Technology Assessment and increase the budget for congressional support agencies, such as the Congressional Budget Office. The senator said she\u2019d also push to have revenue used to fund a public advocate\u2019s office tasked with helping Americans \u201cengage with federal agencies and fight for the public interest in the rule-making process.\u201d Warren\u2019s plan also calls for using the money to bolster federal agencies that are being inundated by companies or industries lobbying against a rule. She noted that having such a mechanism would have been helpful during the Obama administration when financial industry lobbyists successfully stymied the Department of Labor\u2019s proposed \u201cfiduciary rule,\u201d which would have limited brokers abilities to put fees and commissions ahead of earning returns for their clients\u2019 retirement accounts. After a public hearing on the rule, the agency received more than 100 comments \u2014including 45 from members of Congress \u2014 that seemed to repeat industry talking points. Under law, agencies much respond to all concerns laid out in the public comments; the Obama Labor Department ended up withdrawing the proposed rule amid the flood of comments. \u201cEvery time a company above the $500,000 threshold spends money lobbying against a rule from a federal agency, the taxes on that spending will go directly to the agency to help it fight back,\u201d Warren wrote of her proposal. \u201cIn 2010, DOL could have used that money to hire more staffers to complete the rule more quickly and intake the flood of industry comments opposing it.\u201d Contributing: Rebecca Morin",

But what Zuckerberg *has* done is given Trump free rein to lie on his platform -- and then to pay Facebook gobs of money to push out their lies to American voters.\" Warren is referring\u00a0to a Facebook advertising policy that allows for politicians to present false or misleading information in ads due to the belief that any statement from a political figure is important to the public interest.

A senior Facebook official explained that policy in a speech last month. \"We rely on third-party fact-checkers to help reduce the spread of false news and other types of viral misinformation, like memes or manipulated photos and videos,\" Vice President of Global Affairs and Communications Nick Clegg said. \"We don\u2019t believe, however, that it\u2019s an appropriate role for us to referee political debates and prevent a politician\u2019s speech from reaching its audience and being subject to public debate and scrutiny,\" Clegg added. Rather, Facebook \"demotes\" politician-generated ad content that has previously been determined false. The politician advertising policy has\u00a0come under recent scrutiny because of a Trump campaign ad featuring claims about former Vice President Joe Biden's involvement with Ukraine that is not supported\u00a0with credible\u00a0evidence. The Biden campaign requested that Facebook and other sites remove that ad due to misinformation, but Facebook refused, citing its policy. \"Joe Biden promised Ukraine $1 billion dollars if they fired the prosecutor investigating his son's company,\" Trump's ad claimed. In fact, the prosecutor in question was considered by the United States and\u00a0international\u00a0groups to be ineffective at rooting out corruption in Ukraine.\u00a0There is no credible evidence\u00a0for the assertion that the ouster of the prosecutor was intended to benefit Hunter Biden. More: CNN says it won't air a Trump campaign ad featuring 'false' claim against Biden Warren said in her ad, \"If Trump tries to lie in a TV ad, most networks will refuse to air it. But Facebook just cashes Trump's checks.\" CNN and NBCUniversal both refused to air Trump's ad targeting Biden with the Ukraine claims. The Trump campaign spent more than $1 million on Facebook\u00a0ads in one week in September\u00a0to beat back the impeachment inquiry, ABC News reports.\u00a0The ads come as House Democrats push their impeachment inquiry over whether the president pressured Ukraine's leader to investigate Biden in exchange for military aid. Warren's ad is the latest in her battle with big tech companies over her plan to promote competition in the tech industry and roll back tech company mergers, such as Facebook's purchase of WhatsApp. In leaked audio published by\u00a0The Verge, Zuckerberg said\u00a0\"If she gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge.\" Warren replied in a\u00a0series of\u00a0tweets, saying she is \"not afraid to hold Big Tech companies like Facebook, Google, and Amazon accountable.\" More: Warren hits back at Facebook's Zuckerberg after he criticized her plan to break up big tech \"Facebook holds incredible power to affect elections and our national debate. They\u2019ve decided to let political figures lie to you\u2014even about Facebook itself\u2014while their executives and their investors get even richer off the ads containing these lies,\" Warren tweeted\u00a0Saturday about her new Facebook ad. \"If Senator Warren wants to say things she knows to be untrue, we believe Facebook should not be in the position of censoring that speech,\" a Facebook spokesperson told CNN in a statement.

            "content": " Meet the new front-runner: Elizabeth Warren. National polls still show Joe Biden with an edge over the rest of the Democratic presidential field, but the folks most intensely attuned to the contest \u2013 that would be the rivals competing for the nomination \u2013 were targeting Warren Tuesday night at the fourth of the Democratic debates. Flattering, perhaps, but a focus that she never had to handle in the previous debates, and one that sometimes put the Massachusetts senator on the defensive as she dodged questions about whether her Medicare for All plan would result in higher taxes on the middle class and if her proposed \u201cwealth tax\u201d could fly. \u201cI understand that this is hard, but I think as Democrats we are going to succeed when we dream big and fight hard, not when we dream small and quit before we get started,\u201d Warren declared.\u00a0Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar responded with a pointed\u00a0\u201creality check\u201d on Warren. \u201cI'm sorry, Elizabeth,\" Klobuchar said, although she didn't really sound sorry. \"I think we need to be honest here and tell the American people where we\u2019re going to send the invoice.\" Winners and losers: Klobuchar, Buttigieg land some punches; billionaires on defense The debate didn\u2019t fundamentally shape or reshape the Democratic race, perhaps something not even a forum that stretched for more than three hours could do. But the more frontal challenges to Warren on various issues by almost everyone else\u00a0\u2013 Klobuchar,\u00a0South Bend (Ind.) Mayor Pete Buttigieg, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, former Texas congressman Beto O'Rourke, California Sen. Kamala Harris, Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, entrepreneur Andrew Yang\u00a0\u2013\u00a0came amid new questions about whether Biden could be deposed as the moderate alternative to the party's liberal heroes, Warren and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. And Sanders had a prize in his pocket that could boost him, rather than Warren, among voters on the left.\u00a0During the debate, he teased that he would have a \"special guest\" at a campaign rally in Queens on Saturday.\u00a0That turned out to be New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, as The Washington Post quickly reported, one of the party\u2019s most influential young liberal voices. All of the presidential candidates arrived on stage at Otterbein University in Ohio with things to prove: Biden about his family\u2019s ethics. Sanders about his personal health. Warren about her political electability. And the other contenders, now polling in single digits, about whether they could break through\u00a0\u2013 in some cases, whether they could even qualify for next month's debate, where the thresholds on fundraising and poll standing get higher. And when the debate was over? The political landscape for the debate was defined by this core question: Which candidate would be best able to defeat President Trump? That was the case Biden repeatedly tried to make for himself. He touted his age as a sign of wisdom and his experience as invaluable. \"I'm the only one on this stage that has gotten anything really big done,\" he said, citing the Violence Against Women Act and other legislation he helped enact while a senator from Delaware. That got Warren's attention. In the wake of the Great Recession, she noted, she had been instrumental in creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an idea she said skeptics had dismissed as unrealistic. Biden jumped in, saying he had rounded up votes for it. \"Let's get that straight,\" he said. Warren made it clear that wasn't how she saw it. Speaking slowly and with deliberation, she replied: \"I am deeply grateful to President Obama, who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law.\" Sanders fired back at Biden, too. \"I say this as a friend,\" he said, \"but you got the Iraq war done.\" Biden vs. Warren: Two rivals debate whether party should strive for pragmatism or sweeping change The stage was crowded with a dozen Democrats, the biggest debate to date, sponsored by CNN and The New York Times.\u00a0Warren scored an overwhelming win by one measure: Who got the most time to speak, in large part because the moderators repeatedly gave her\u00a0time to respond to attacks.\u00a0In the end, she spoke for close to 23 minutes, far longer than Biden, a distant second at about 16-1/2. Which seems only fair. After all, she is, apparently, the new front-runner.",

Trump had said on Twitter that because of Google's misdeeds, \"Google must be sued\" and added that his electoral victory should have been larger. PolitiFact, a nonpartisan fact-checking website, rated Trump's claim \"false.\" The site noted that Trump appeared to be referring to a 2017 research paper by psychologists Robert Epstein and Ronald Robertson. The paper had claimed that users' search results were biased in favor of Clinton, which could have possibly shifted votes to her. The paper's methodology and findings have been\u00a0questioned by other academics. who said the paper had failed to adequately explain its methodology or even define what \"bias\" was.

Epstein and Robertson had hedged their findings in their paper, too. \"We don\u2019t know what caused these patterns of bias,\" wrote Epstein and his co-author in the paper. Trump has frequently vented about his loss in the popular vote to Clinton. Trump won the electoral vote but lost the popular vote to Clinton by several million votes, and Trump has claimed that millions of Americans voted illegally for Clinton. The president has not provided evidence for these claims.",

In a series of tweets Friday, Gabbard called Clinton the \"personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long.\" Gabbard also alleged there has been a \"concerted campaign\" to destroy her reputation since she announced her presidential run in January. \"It's now clear that this primary is between you and me,\" Gabbard tweeted about Clinton. \"Don't cowardly hide behind your proxies.

Here is what happened last time There is lingering trepidation in the Democratic Party of a repeat of the 2016 presidential race, when Russia interfered in the U.S. election in an effort to help Donald Trump defeat Clinton. U.S intelligence agencies have warned that Russia intends to meddle in the 2020 presidential election, as well. Russian President Vladimir Putin has mocked that possibility, joking earlier this month that Moscow would \"definitely intervene\" again. During a Democratic presidential debate on Tuesday, Gabbard criticized a TV commentator who she said had called her \"an asset of Russia.\" She called the comments \"completely despicable.\" Without naming Gabbard, Clinton seemed to echo the commentator's remark during a podcast appearance this week on \"Campaign HQ with David Plouffe.\" Plouffe was campaign manager for President Barack Obama in 2008 and served as served as a senior adviser to the president. \"She's the favorite of the Russians,\" Clinton said, referring to the person she had earlier identified as a woman \"who's currently in the Democratic primary.\" ''They have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far.\" Clinton also called Trump \"Vladimir Putin's dream\" in the interview. She went on to say that Trump's inauguration speech was \"like a declaration of war on half of America.\" Clinton also describes 2016 Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein as \"a Russian asset.\" The Russians know they can't win without a third-party candidate, Clinton added. Stein, who ran against Trump and Clinton as a Green Party candidate, received about 1% of the vote in the 2016 election, but some Democrats said her candidacy syphoned votes away from Clinton and helped Trump win, particularly in states like Wisconsin. The Senate Intelligence Committee asked Stein for documents as part of its probe into Russian interference in the election because she attended a 2015 dinner in Moscow sponsored by Russian television network RT with Putin. Stein has said she attended \"with a message of Middle East peace, diplomacy and cooperation.\" In a tweet Friday, Stein accused Clinton of \"peddling conspiracy theories to justify her failure instead of reflecting on real reasons Dems lost in 2016.\"",

Some Iowans showed their support for Gabbard after former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton suggested that Russians are \"grooming\" a Democratic presidential candidate\u00a0to run as a third-party candidate Friday. While Clinton did not name Gabbard, the comment appeared to be directed at the Democrat from\u00a0Hawaii. On Saturday, Gabbard said the past 24 hours had \"a lot of news,\" but it brought to the forefront the reasons why she believes her campaign is important: it threatens the party's establishment. More: Tulsi Gabbard fires back at Hillary Clinton suggestion that she's Russia's pawn Gabbard has said multiple times she is not considering a third-party run, both before and after Clinton's statement. \"She knows she can't control me,\" Gabbard told the Des Moines Register on Saturday.\u00a0\"She knows that if I'm the nominee, if I become president, she can't have any influence or any control over the kind of foreign policy I would lead our country in. Both her and her proxies and the foreign policy establishment.\" Gabbard said Clinton was the \"queen of warmongers\" on Twitter Friday in response to her comments. Despite the back-and-forth between Gabbard and Clinton, Gabbard was met with good cheer by Hawkeyes fans Saturday morning. A group of people at a tiki bar tailgate drank a round of Fireball whiskey shots in her honor, shouting \"Tulsi time!\" as she mingled with the crowd. Maria Frazer, a 21-year-old University of Iowa student, is still deciding who she wants to support in the Iowa caucus. She's heard allegations about Gabbard's ties with Russia, but while she doesn't \"necessarily buy into it,\" Frazer said Americans should be wary of foreign governments' influence in the presidential election. \"I am concerned, not necessarily about Tulsi,\" she said. \"But it's something I'm very cautious about. I think we need to be cautious about in the future.\" Chris Forbes, a 52-year-old man in Iowa City, gave Gabbard a Twinkie as they talked politics. He already committed to caucus for U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris, but said it's important for foreign policy to take a bigger role in the presidential election\u00a0\u2014 something Gabbard brings. He doesn't agree entirely with Gabbard's positions. Forbes said\u00a0the U.S. military should still play some role in foreign conflicts, especially in cases when allies are at risk, like the Kurds in northern Syria following President Donald Trump's decision to leave the region. \"I agree that steps should be made to pull away from some of the actions of being the world's policemen,\" Forbes said. \"But I also believe the\u00a0standard of American democracy for 240 years has been to be a beacon of freedom for the rest of the world. And as such, we need to have just enough present\u00a0to represent that freedom and world leadership toward democracy so that all groups can feel safe in being free to stand openly for what they believe.\" Gabbard said Clinton and other Democrats accusing her of being a \"Russian asset\" is a strategy to stop Americans from criticizing U.S. foreign policy decisions. \"This threatens our freedom of speech and is very revealing about the real motives behind this smear campaign that literally began the day I announced my candidacy for president,\"\u00a0Gabbard said.
