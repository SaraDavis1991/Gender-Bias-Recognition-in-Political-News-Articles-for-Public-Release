'''
Uncomment the option you wish to run; our "overall words" were obtained with  option 1, our "adjective words" were 
obtained with option 2. You can turn print_vocab off without affecting results. 
file_name_1 is the cumulative word vector for all words in the articles
file_name_2 is a vector of vectors for the words in each article
model_name is the name of the svm trained to create the BOW
not_pos is a bool that determines if the BOW is run on all words or adj. If True, all words
lemmad is a bool that determines if a lemma is applied to the words. if True, a lemma is applied
print_vocab is a bool that determines if all of the vocab from the BOW is printed- helps confirm proper cleaning occurs

NOTE: to run this file, articles must have been collected and run_preprocessor.py must have been run
